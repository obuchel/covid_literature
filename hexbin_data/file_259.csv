1042,Observational Research in Childhood Infectious Diseases (ORChID): a dynamic birth cohort study,2012-10-31,"INTRODUCTION: Even in developed economies infectious diseases remain the most common cause of illness in early childhood. Our current understanding of the epidemiology of these infections is limited by reliance on data from decades ago performed using low-sensitivity laboratory methods, and recent studies reporting severe, hospital-managed disease. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The Observational Research in Childhood Infectious Diseases (ORChID) study is an ongoing study enrolling a dynamic birth cohort to document the community-based epidemiology of viral respiratory and gastrointestinal infections in early childhood. Women are recruited antenatally, and their healthy newborn is followed for the first 2 years of life. Parents keep a daily symptom diary for the study child, collect a weekly anterior nose swab and dirty nappy swab and complete a burden diary when a child meets pre-defined illness criteria. Specimens will be tested for a wide range of viruses by real-time PCR assays. Primary analyses involves calculating incidence rates for acute respiratory illness (ARI) and acute gastroenteritis (AGE) for the cohort by age and seasonality. Control material from children when they are without symptoms will allow us to determine what proportion of ARIs and AGE can be attributed to specific pathogens. Secondary analyses will assess the incidence and shedding duration of specific respiratory and gastrointestinal pathogens. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study is approved by The Human Research Ethics Committees of the Children's Health Queensland Hospital and Health Service, the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital and The University of Queensland.

4196,"Hypertension is associated with an increased risk for severe imported falciparum malaria: a tertiary care hospital based observational study from Berlin, Germany",2019-12-06,"BACKGROUND: Increasing numbers of aging individuals with chronic co-morbidities travel to regions where falciparum malaria is endemic. Non-communicable diseases are now leading risk factors for death in such countries. Thus, the influence of chronic diseases on the outcome of falciparum malaria is an issue of major importance. Aim of the present study was to assess whether non-communicable diseases increase the risk for severe imported falciparum malaria. METHODS: A retrospective observational study of all adult cases with imported falciparum malaria hospitalized between 2001 and 2015 in the tertiary care Charité University Hospital, Berlin, was performed. RESULTS: A total of 536 adult patients (median age 37 years; 31.3% female) were enrolled. Of these, 329 (61.4%) originated from endemic countries, 207 patients (38.6%) from non-endemic regions. Criteria for severe malaria were fulfilled in 68 (12.7%) cases. With older age, lack of previous malaria episodes, being a tourist, and delayed presentation, well-characterized risk factors were associated with severe malaria in univariate analysis. After adjustment for these potential confounders hypertension (adjusted odds ratio aOR, 3.06 95% confidence interval, CI 1.34–7.02), cardiovascular diseases (aOR, 8.20 95% CI 2.30–29.22), and dyslipidaemia (aOR, 6.08 95% CI 1.13–32.88) were individual diseases associated with severe disease in multivariable logistic regression. Hypertension proved an independent risk factor among individuals of endemic (aOR, 4.83, 95% CI 1.44–16.22) as well as of non-endemic origin (aOR, 3.60 95% CI 1.05–12.35). CONCLUSIONS: In imported falciparum malaria hypertension and its related diseases are risk factors for severe disease.","Hoffmeister, Bodo; Aguilar Valdez, Abner Daniel",Malar J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6898961/,259

11775,The KOMPACT-P study: Knee Osteoarthritis Management with Physiotherapy informed by Acceptance and Commitment Therapy—Pilot study protocol,2020-06-03,"Purpose: next-generation sequencing based comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) is becoming common practice. Although numerous studies have shown its feasibility to identify actionable genomic alterations in most patients, its clinical impact as part of routine management across all cancers in the community remains unknown. Methods: we conducted a retrospective study of all patients that underwent CGP as part of routine cancer management from January 2013 to June 2017 at an academic community-based NCI-designated cancer center. CGP was done in addition to established first tier reflex molecular testing as per national guidelines (e.g., EGFR/ALK for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and extended-RAS for colorectal cancer). Results: 349 tests were sent for CGP from 333 patients and 95% had at least one actionable genomic alteration reported. According to the reported results, 23.2% had a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved therapy available, 61.3% had an off-label therapy available and 77.9% were potentially eligible for a clinical trial. Treatment recommendations were also reviewed within the OncoKB database and 47% of them were not clinically validated therapies. The CGP results led to treatment change in only 35 patients (10%), most commonly in NSCLC. Nineteen of these patients (54% of those treated and 5% of total) had documented clinical benefit with targeted therapy. Conclusion: we demonstrate that routine use of CGP in the community across all cancer types detects potentially actionable genomic alterations in a majority of patients, however has modest clinical impact enriched in the NSCLC subset.","Singh, Aditi P.; Shum, Elaine; Rajdev, Lakshmi; Cheng, Haiying; Goel, Sanjay; Perez-Soler, Roman; Halmos, Balazs",Cancers (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7281757/,259
16988,Direct discharge from the emergency department of simple stable injuries: a propensity score-adjusted non-inferiority trial,2021-04-14,"Musk ketone exerts antiproliferative effects on several types of cancer, such as lung and breast cancer. However, the effects and underlying mechanisms of action of musk ketone in gastric cancer (GC) are poorly understood. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of musk ketone in GC cells. The present study indicated that musk ketone exerted significant anticancer effects on GC cells. The IC(50) values of musk ketone were 4.2 and 10.06 µM in AGS and HGC-27 cells, respectively. Low dosage of musk ketone significantly suppressed the proliferation and colony formation of AGS and HGC-27 cells. Cell cycle arrest and apoptosis were induced by musk ketone. Furthermore, microarray data indicated that musk ketone treatment led to downregulation of various genes, including sorbin and SH3 domain containing 2 (SORBS2). Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR and immunoblotting results indicated that musk ketone repressed mRNA and protein expression levels of SORBS2. It was also shown that knockdown of SORBS2 inhibited the proliferation and colony formation of HGC-27 cells. The antiproliferative effects of musk ketone were decreased in HGC-27 cells with SORBS2 silencing. In summary, the present study indicated that musk ketone suppressed the proliferation and growth of GC partly by downregulating SORBS2 expression.","An, Juan; Wang, Haiyan; Ma, Xiaoming; Hu, Binwen; Yan, Yunfei; Yan, Yupeng; Su, Zhanhai",Mol Med Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8060797/,259

17387,Pediatric procedural sedation and analgesia in the emergency department: surveying the current European practice,2021-01-28,"Ischemic diseases characterized by an insufficient blood flow that leads to a decrease in oxygen and nutrient uptake by cells have emerged as an important contributor to both disability and death worldwide. Up-regulation of angiogenesis may be a key factor for the improvement of ischemic diseases. This article searched articles in PubMed with the following keywords: stem cells, exosomes, angiogenesis, ischemic diseases either alone or in grouping form. The most relevant selected items were stem cell-derived exosomes and ischemic diseases. A growing body of evidence indicates that stem cells produce exosomes, which is the novel emerging approach to cell-to-cell communication and offers a new standpoint on known therapeutic strategies of ischemic diseases. Exosomes transport biological molecules such as many types of proteins, RNAs, DNA fragments, signaling molecules, and lipids between cells. Different stem cells release exosomes representing beneficial effects on ischemic diseases as they promote angiogenesis both in vitro and in vivo experiments. Application of exosomes for therapeutic angiogenesis opened new opportunities in the regenerative medicine, however, some limitations regarding exosomes isolation and application remain concerned. In addition, most of the experiments were conducted in preclinical and therefore translation of these results from bench to bed requires more effort in this field. Exosomes from stem cells are a promising tool for the treatment of ischemic diseases. In addition, translation of pre-clinic results into clinic needs further studies in this field.","Babaei, Majid; Rezaie, Jafar",J Transl Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8106139/,259
17720,The effect of community-driven larval source management and house improvement on malaria transmission when added to the standard malaria control strategies in Malawi: a cluster-randomized controlled trial,2021-05-22,"BACKGROUND: Patients in intensive care units (ICUs) often received broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment and Acinetobacter baumannii (A.b.) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P.a.) were the most common pathogens causing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). This study aimed to examine the effects and mechanism of mechanical ventilation (MV) on A.b.-induced lung injury and the involvement of alveolar macrophages (AMs). METHODS: C57BL/6 wild-type (WT) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase knockout (JNK1(−/−)) mice received MV for 3 h at 2 days after nasal instillation of A.b., P.a. (1 × 10(6) colony-forming unit, CFU), or normal saline. RESULTS: Intranasal instillation of 10(6) CFU A.b. in C57BL/6 mice induced a significant increase in total cells and protein levels in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and neutrophil infiltration in the lungs. MV after A.b. instillation increases neutrophil infiltration, interleukin (IL)-6 and vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM) mRNA expression in the lungs and total cells, IL-6 levels, and nitrite levels in the BALF. The killing activity of AMs against A.b. was lower than against P.a. The diminished killing activity was parallel with decreased tumor necrosis factor-α production by AMs compared with A.b. Inducible nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, S-methylisothiourea, decreased the total cell number in BALF on mice receiving A.b. instillation and ventilation. Moreover, MV decreased the A.b. and P.a. killing activity of AMs. MV after A.b. instillation induced less total cells in the BALF and nitrite production in the serum of JNK1(−/−) mice than those of WT mice. CONCLUSION: A.b. is potent in inducing neutrophil infiltration in the lungs and total protein in the BALF. MV enhances A.b.-induced lung injury through an increase in the expression of VCAM and IL-6 levels in the BALF and a decrease in the bacteria-killing activity of AMs. A lower inflammation level in JNK1(−/−) mice indicates that A.b.-induced VAP causes lung injury through JNK signaling pathway in the lungs.

17927,Complications following regional anesthesia versus general anesthesia for the treatment of distal radius fractures,2021-05-29,"BACKGROUND: There is an ongoing debate whether electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) should be advocated for smoking cessation. Because of this uncertainty, information about the use of e-cigarettes for smoking cessation is usually not provided in governmental smoking cessation communications. However, there is an information need among smokers because despite this uncertainty, e-cigarettes are used by many smokers to reduce and quit tobacco smoking. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to describe the protocol of a randomized controlled trial that assesses the effect of providing tailored information about e-cigarettes compared to not providing this information on determinants of decision making and smoking reduction and abstinence. This information is provided in the context of a digital smoking cessation intervention. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial with a 6-month follow-up period will be conducted among adult smokers motivated to quit smoking within 5 years. Participants will be 1:1 randomized into either the intervention condition or control condition. In this trial, which is grounded on the I-Change model, participants in both conditions will receive tailored feedback on attitude, social influence, preparatory plans, self-efficacy, and coping plans. Information on 6 clusters of smoking cessation methods (face-to-face counselling, eHealth interventions, telephone counselling, group-based programs, nicotine replacement therapy, and prescription medication) will be provided in both conditions. Smokers in the intervention condition will also receive detailed tailored information on e-cigarettes, while smokers in the control condition will not receive this information. The primary outcome measure will be the number of tobacco cigarettes smoked in the past 7 days. Secondary outcome measures will include 7-day point prevalence tobacco abstinence, 7-day point prevalence e-cigarette abstinence, and determinants of decision making (ie, knowledge and attitude regarding e-cigarettes). All outcomes will be self-assessed through web-based questionnaires. RESULTS: This project is supported by a research grant of the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (Rijksinstituut voor Volksgezondheid en Milieu). Ethical approval was granted by the Ethics Review Committee Health, Medicine and Life Sciences at Maastricht University (FHML-REC/2019/072). Recruitment began in March 2020 and was completed by July 2020. We enrolled 492 smokers in this study. The results are expected to be published in June 2021. CONCLUSIONS: The experimental design of this study allows conclusions to be formed regarding the effects of tailored information about e-cigarettes on decision making and smoking behavior. Our findings can inform the development of future smoking cessation interventions.

18139,"Protocol for the WARM Hearts study: examining cardiovascular disease risk in middle-aged and older women - a prospective, observational cohort study",2021-05-25,"OBJECTIVES: Social media use is associated with developing communities of practice that promote the rapid exchange of information across traditional institutional and geographical boundaries faster than previously possible. We aimed to describe and share our experience using #neoEBM (Neonatal Evidence Based Medicine) hashtag to organise and build a digital community of neonatal care practice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Analysis of #neoEBM Twitter data in the Symplur Signals database between 1 May 2018 to 9 January 2021. Data on tweets containing the #neoEBM hashtag were analysed using online analytical tools, including the total number of tweets and user engagement. RESULTS: Since its registration, a total of 3 228 distinct individual Twitter users used the hashtag with 23 939 tweets and 37 259 710 impressions generated. The two days with the greatest number of tweets containing #neoEBM were 8 May 2018 (n = 218) and 28 April 2019 (n = 340), coinciding with the annual Pediatric Academic Societies meeting. The majority of Twitter users made one tweet using #neoEBM (n = 1078), followed by two tweets (n = 411) and more than 10 tweets (n = 347). The number of individual impressions (views) of tweets containing #neoEBM was 37 259 710. Of the 23 939 tweets using #neoEBM, 17 817 (74%) were retweeted (shared), 15 643 (65%) included at least one link and 1 196 (5%) had at least one reply. As #neoEBM users increased over time, so did tweets containing #neoEBM, with each additional user of the hashtag associated with a mean increase in 7.8 (95% CI 7.7–8.0) tweets containing #neoEBM. CONCLUSION: Our findings support the observation that the #neoEBM community possesses many of the characteristics of a community of practice, and it may be an effective tool to disseminate research findings. By sharing our experiences, we hope to encourage others to engage with or build online digital communities of practice to share knowledge and build collaborative networks across disciplines, institutions and countries.","Keir, Amy; Bamat, Nicolas; Hennebry, Bron; King, Brian; Patel, Ravi; Wright, Clyde; Scrivens, Alexandra; ElKhateeb, Omar; Mitra, Souvik; Roland, Damian",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8162580/,259

18842,Accuracy of the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS)-4 and GDS-5 for the screening of depression among older adults: A systematic review and meta-analysis,2021-07-01,"BACKGROUND: Hypotension and hypoxemic respiratory failure are common among neonates with hypoxic–ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) undergoing therapeutic hypothermia (TH). Right ventricular (RV) dysfunction is associated with adverse neurodevelopment. Individualized management utilizing targeted neonatal echocardiography (TnECHO) may enhance care. METHODS: We evaluated the influence of TnECHO programs on cardiovascular practices in HIE/TH patients utilizing a 77-item REDCap survey. Nominated representatives of TnECHO (n = 19) or non-TnECHO (n = 96) sites were approached. RESULTS: Seventy-one (62%) sites responded. Baseline neonatal intensive care unit characteristics and HIE volume were comparable between groups. Most centers monitor invasive blood pressure; however, we identified 17 unique definitions of hypotension. TnECHO centers were likelier to trend systolic/diastolic blood pressure and request earlier echocardiography. TnECHO responders were less likely to use fluid boluses; TnECHO responders more commonly chose an inotrope first-line, while non-TnECHO centers used a vasopressor. For HRF, TnECHO centers chose vasopressors with a favorable pulmonary vascular profile. Non-TnECHO centers used more dopamine and more extracorporeal membrane oxygen for patients with HRF. CONCLUSIONS: Cardiovascular practices in neonates with HIE differ between centers with and without TnECHO. Consensus regarding the definition of hypotension is lacking and dopamine use is common. The merits of these practices among these patients, who frequently have comorbid pulmonary hypertension and RV dysfunction, need prospective evaluation. IMPACT: Cardiovascular care following HIE while undergoing therapeutic hypothermia varies between centers with access to trained hemodynamics specialists and those without. Because cardiovascular dysfunction is associated with brain injury, precision medicine-based care may be an avenue to improving outcomes. Therapeutic hypothermia has introduced new physiological considerations and enhanced survival. It is essential that hemodynamic strategies evolve to keep pace; however, little literature exists. Lack of consensus regarding fundamental definitions (e.g., hypotension) highlights the importance of collaboration among the scientific community to advance the field. The value of enhanced cardiovascular care guided by hemodynamic specialists requires prospective evaluation.","Giesinger, Regan E.; Levy, Philip T.; Ruoss, J.

19201,Comparative Effectiveness of Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter 2 Inhibitors vs Sulfonylureas in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes,2021-06-28,"The heterotrimeric Sec61 complex is a major site for the biogenesis of transmembrane proteins (TMPs), accepting nascent TMP precursors that are targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by the signal recognition particle (SRP). Unlike most single-spanning membrane proteins, the integration of type III TMPs is completely resistant to small molecule inhibitors of the Sec61 translocon. Using siRNA-mediated depletion of specific ER components, in combination with the potent Sec61 inhibitor ipomoeassin F (Ipom-F), we show that type III TMPs utilise a distinct pathway for membrane integration at the ER. Hence, following SRP-mediated delivery to the ER, type III TMPs can uniquely access the membrane insertase activity of the ER membrane complex (EMC) via a mechanism that is facilitated by the Sec61 translocon. This alternative EMC-mediated insertion pathway allows type III TMPs to bypass the Ipom-F-mediated blockade of membrane integration that is seen with obligate Sec61 clients.","O’Keefe, Sarah; Zong, Guanghui; Duah, Kwabena B.; Andrews, Lauren E.; Shi, Wei Q.; High, Stephen",Commun Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8249459/,259

21521,Correlation of inflammatory cytokines on corrected QT interval in rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis patients,2021-09-14,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Goal attainment scaling (GAS) has been widely applied to chronic conditions; however, only recently has it been used for patients with low back pain (LBP). The objectives of this systematic review were to (a) examine the characteristics and rigor of published studies of GAS in the rehabilitation of patients with LBP, (b) describe how GAS has been applied in patients with LBP, and (c) evaluate the responsiveness and validity of GAS as an outcome measure in patients with LBP. METHODS: A systematic search of the CINAHL, PubMed, and MEDLINE databases was performed (1968 and 1 September 2020) in addition to hand searching. Studies including GAS procedures in patients with LBP during rehabilitation were included in the review. Two authors independently selected studies for inclusion and determined levels of evidence using the Oxford Levels of Evidence and rated each study for quality using the Newcastle‐Ottawa scale and reporting transparency using the STROBE statement checklist. RESULTS: Six Level IV and one Level III/IV study were included in this review (search produced 248 studies for review). These studies assessed GAS feasibility, validity, sensitivity, and association with other outcome measures in patients with LBP. Findings suggest that patients with LBP are able to identify and set individualized goals during GAS, while GAS may be more sensitive to change and may measure different aspects of the patient experience as compared with fixed‐item patient‐reported measures. Additionally, GAS may have a therapeutic effect while improving patient outcomes and may be associated with patient satisfaction. CONCLUSION: Based on this review, GAS shows promise as a feasible patient‐centered measure that may be more responsive to change than traditional outcome measures. However, GAS has been inadequately developed and validated for use during rehabilitation in patients with LBP.","Haladay, Douglas; Swisher, Laura; Hardwick, Dustin",Health Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8459028/,259
22165,Low-Value Care at the Actionable Level of Individual Health Systems,2021-09-27,"OBJECTIVES: It is currently thought that most—but not all—individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 develop symptoms, but the infectious period starts on average 2 days before the first overt symptoms appear. It is estimated that pre- and asymptomatic individuals are responsible for more than half of all transmissions. By detecting infected individuals before they have overt symptoms, wearable devices could potentially and significantly reduce the proportion of transmissions by pre-symptomatic individuals. Using laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections (detected via serology tests [to determine if there are antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 in the blood] or SARS-CoV-2 infection tests such as polymerase chain reaction [PCR] or antigen tests) as the gold standard, we will determine the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) for the following two algorithms to detect first time SARS-CoV-2 infection including early or asymptomatic infection: • The algorithm using Ava bracelet data when coupled with self-reported Daily Symptom Diary data (Wearable + Symptom Data Algo; experimental condition) • The algorithm using self-reported Daily Symptom Diary data alone (Symptom Only Algo; control condition) In addition, we will determine which of the two algorithms has superior performance characteristics for detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection including early or asymptomatic infection as confirmed by SARS-CoV-2 virus testing. TRIAL DESIGN: The trial is a randomized, single-blinded, two-period, two-sequence crossover trial. The study will start with an initial learning phase (maximum of 3 months), followed by period 1 (3 months) and period 2 (3 months). Subjects entering the study at the end of the recruitment period may directly start with period 1 and will not be part of the learning phase. Each subject will undergo the experimental condition (the Wearable + Symptom Data Algo) in either period 1 or period 2 and the control condition (Symptom Only Algo) in the other period. The order will be randomly assigned, resulting in subjects being allocated 1:1 to either sequence 1 (experimental condition first) or sequence 2 (control condition first). Based on demographics, medical history and/or profession, each subject will be stratified at baseline into a high-risk and normal-risk group within each sequence. PARTICIPANTS: The trial will be conducted in the Netherlands. A target of 20,000 subjects will be enrolled. Based on demographics, medical history and/or profession, each subject will be stratified at baseline into a high-risk and normal-risk group within each sequence. This results in approximately 6500 normal-risk individuals and 3500 high-risk individuals per sequence. Subjects will be recruited from previously studied cohorts as well as via public campaigns and social media. All data for this study will be collected remotely through the Ava COVID-RED app, the Ava bracelet, surveys in the COVID-RED web portal and self-sampling serology and PCR kits. More information on the study can be found in www.covid-red.eu. During recruitment, subjects will be invited to visit the COVID-RED web portal. After successfully completing the enrolment questionnaire, meeting eligibility criteria and indicating interest in joining the study, subjects will receive the subject information sheet and informed consent form. Subjects can enrol in COVID-RED if they comply with the following inclusion and exclusion criteria: Inclusion criteria: • Resident of the Netherlands • At least 18 years old • Informed consent provided (electronic) • Willing to adhere to the study procedures described in the protocol • Must have a smartphone that runs at least Android 8.0 or iOS 13.0 operating systems and is active for the duration of the study (in the case of a change of mobile number, the study team should be notified) • Be able to read, understand and write Dutch Exclusion criteria: • Previous positive SARS-CoV-2 test result (confirmed either through PCR/antigen or antibody tests; self-reported) • Current suspected (e.g. waiting for test result) COVID-19 infection or symptoms of a COVID-19 infection (self-reported) • Participating in any other COVID-19 clinical drug, vaccine or medical device trial (self-reported) • Electronic implanted device (such as a pacemaker; self-reported) • Pregnant at the time of informed consent (self-reported) • Suffering from cholinergic urticaria (per the Ava bracelet’s user manual; self-reported) • Staff involved in the management or conduct of this study INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: All subjects will be instructed to complete the Daily Symptom Diary in the Ava COVID-RED app daily, wear their Ava bracelet each night and synchronize it with the app each day for the entire period of study participation. Provided with wearable sensor and/or self-reported symptom data within the last 24 h, the Ava COVID-RED app’s underlying algorithms will provide subjects with a real-time indicator of their overall health and well-being. Subjects will see one of three messages, notifying them that no seeming deviations in symptoms and/or physiological parameters have been detected; some changes in symptoms and/or physiological parameters have been detected and they should self-isolate; or alerting them that deviations in their symptoms and/or physiological parameters could be suggestive of a potential COVID-19 infection and to seek additional testing. We will assess the intraperson performance of the algorithms in the experimental condition (Wearable + Symptom Data Algo) and control conditions (Symptom Only Algo). Note that both algorithms will also instruct to seek testing when any SARS-CoV-2 symptoms are reported in line with those defined by the Dutch national institute for public health and the environment ‘Rijksinstituut voor Volksgezondheid en Milieu’ (RIVM) guidelines. MAIN OUTCOMES: The trial will evaluate the use and performance of the Ava COVID-RED app and Ava bracelet, which uses sensors to measure breathing rate, pulse rate, skin temperature and heart rate variability for the purpose of early and asymptomatic detection and monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 in general and high-risk populations. Using laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections (detected via serology tests, PCR tests and/or antigen tests) as the gold standard, we will determine the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) for each of the following two algorithms to detect first-time SARS-CoV-2 infection including early or asymptomatic infection: the algorithm using Ava bracelet data when coupled with the self-reported Daily Symptom Diary data and the algorithm using self-reported Daily Symptom Diary data alone. In addition, we will determine which of the two algorithms has superior performance characteristics for detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection including early or asymptomatic infection as confirmed by SARS-CoV-2 virus testing. The protocol contains an additional twenty secondary and exploratory objectives which address, among others, infection incidence rates, health resource utilization, symptoms reported by SARS-CoV-2-infected participants and the rate of breakthrough and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections among individuals vaccinated against COVID-19. PCR or antigen testing will occur when the subject receives a notification from the algorithm to seek additional testing. Subjects will be advised to get tested via the national testing programme and report the testing result in the Ava COVID-RED app and a survey. If they cannot obtain a test via the national testing programme, they will receive a nasal swab self-sampling kit at home, and the sample will be tested by PCR in a trial-affiliated laboratory. In addition, all subjects will be asked to take a capillary blood sample at home at baseline (between month 0 and 3.5 months after the start of subject recruitment), at the end of the learning phase (month 3; note that this sampling moment is skipped if a subject entered the study at the end of the recruitment period), period 1 (month 6) and period 2 (month 9). These samples will be used for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody testing in a trial-affiliated laboratory, differentiating between antibodies resulting from a natural infection and antibodies resulting from COVID-19 vaccination (as vaccination will gradually be rolled out during the trial period). Baseline samples will only be analysed if the sample collected at the end of the learning phase is positive, or if the subject entered the study at the end of the recruitment period, and samples collected at the end of period 1 will only be analysed if the sample collected at the end of period 2 is positive. When subjects obtain a positive PCR/antigen or serology test result during the study, they will continue to be in the study but will be moved into a so-called COVID-positive mode in the Ava COVID-RED app. This means that they will no longer receive recommendations from the algorithms but can still contribute and track symptom and bracelet data. The primary analysis of the main objective will be executed using the data collected in period 2 (months 6 through 9). Within this period, serology tests (before and after period 2) and PCR/antigen tests (taken based on recommendations by the algorithms) will be used to determine if a subject was infected with SARS-CoV-2 or not. Within this same time period, it will be determined if the algorithms gave any recommendations for testing. The agreement between these quantities will be used to evaluate the performance of the algorithms and how these compare between the study conditions. RANDOMIZATION: All eligible subjects will be randomized using a stratified block randomization approach with an allocation ratio of 1:1 to one of two sequences (experimental condition followed by control condition or control condition followed by experimental condition). Based on demographics, medical history and/or profession, each subject will be stratified at baseline into a high-risk and normal-risk group within each sequence, resulting in approximately equal numbers of high-risk and normal-risk individuals between the sequences. BLINDING (MASKING): In this study, subjects will be blinded to the study condition and randomization sequence. Relevant study staff and the device manufacturer will be aware of the assigned sequence. The subject will wear the Ava bracelet and complete the Daily Symptom Diary in the Ava COVID-RED app for the full duration of the study, and they will not know if the feedback they receive about their potential infection status will only be based on the data they entered in the Daily Symptom Diary within the Ava COVID-RED app or based on both the data from the Daily Symptom Diary and the Ava bracelet. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMIZED (SAMPLE SIZE): A total of 20,000 subjects will be recruited and randomized 1:1 to either sequence 1 (experimental condition followed by control condition) or sequence 2 (control condition followed by experimental condition), taking into account their risk level. This results in approximately 6500 normal-risk and 3500 high-risk individuals per sequence. TRIAL STATUS: Protocol version: 3.0, dated May 3, 2021. Start of recruitment: February 19, 2021.

The aim of this contribution is to stimulate research in order to close serious knowledge gaps in mainstream economics that the recent financial and economic crisis has revealed. By identifying weak points of conventional approaches in economics, we identify the scientific problems which need to be addressed. We expect that solving these questions will bring scientists in a position to give better decision support and policy advice. We also indicate, what kinds of insights can be contributed by scientists from other research fields such as physics, biology, computer and social science. In order to make a quick progress and gain a systemic understanding of the whole interconnected socio-economic-environmental system, using the data, information and computer systems available today and in the near future, we suggest a multi-disciplinary collaboration as most promising research approach.","Helbing, Dirk",Social Self-Organization,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123964/,259

Here we provide mechanistic details on interactions between membrane active peptides with antimicrobial effect (MAPs) and red blood cell derived EVs (REVs) and we demonstrate that they have the capacity to remove members of the protein corona from REVs even at lower than 5 μM concentrations. In case of REVs, the Soret-band arising from the membrane associated hemoglobins allowed to follow the detachment process by flow-Linear Dichroism (flow-LD). Further on, the significant change on the vesicle surfaces was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Since membrane active peptides, such as melittin have the affinity to disrupt vesicles, a combination of techniques, fluorescent antibody labeling, microfluidic resistive pulse sensing, and flow-LD were employed to distinguish between membrane destruction and surface protein detachment. The removal of protein corona members is a newly identified role for the investigated peptides, which indicates complexity of their in vivo function, but may also be exploited in synthetic and natural nanoparticle engineering. Furthermore, results also promote that EVs can be used as improved model systems for biophysical studies providing insight to areas with so far limited knowledge.","Singh, Priyanka; Szigyártó, Imola Cs.; Ricci, Maria; Zsila, Ferenc; Juhász, Tünde; Mihály, Judith; Bősze, Szilvia; Bulyáki, Éva; Kardos, József; Kitka, Diána; Varga, Zoltán; Beke-Somfai, Tamás",Front Chem,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7432246/,259

We used the control-value theory of achievement emotions and ability conception from emotional intelligence as a theoretical framework. Participants were 62 students followed longitudinally from seventh to eighth grade, assigned to an experimental or a control condition. Pre- and post-test measures assessed knowledge on achievement emotions, strategies to regulate achievement emotions, native language-related achievement emotions, and grades. The intervention was embedded within the native language domain and included ten units. We focused on a range of ten positive and negative, activating and deactivating emotions, and associated emotion regulation strategies. Compared to the control group, students in the experimental group improved knowledge of emotional lexicon and emotion strategies; they decreased some negative native language-related emotions; and only boys increased native language-related grades. The findings supported the efficacy of the training and were discussed referring to relevant theoretical approaches.

43019,Issue Highlights,2020-12-10,"BACKGROUND: Owing to their resistance to an important class of antibiotics, the prevention and treatment of carbapenem-resistant (CR)/non-susceptible Gram-negative (GN) infections has become an important public health objective. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of published literature to evaluate the burden of CR GN infections, focusing on high-risk patients such as transplant recipients, or patients with cancer, renal impairment, or sepsis. METHODS: MEDLINE®, Cochrane Central, and Embase® were searched between 2010 and March 2019. Abstracts and full-text articles were screened in duplicate. Random effects meta-analysis was conducted when reported outcomes were sufficiently similar. RESULTS: Twenty-six publications were eligible. Meta-analyses found increased mortality associated with CR infections among high-risk patients in both unadjusted analysis (8 studies; summary unadjusted odds ratio [OR]: 5.85; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.69, 9.26; I(2) = 19.8%) and adjusted analysis (5 studies; summary hazard ratio [HR]: 4.67; 95% CI: 2.18, 9.99; I(2) = 77.7%), compared to patients with carbapenem-susceptible (CS) infections or no infection. Increased mortality was also seen in subgroup analyses by length of follow-up (either short-term or long-term) or causative pathogen. A limited number of studies found that CR GN infections increased the risk for mechanical ventilation, adverse events such as graft failure or acute rejection in solid organ transplant recipients, increased renal failure or nephrotoxicity, and an increase in readmissions and costs, though the findings reported in the literature were not consistent. CONCLUSION: This systematic literature review and meta-analysis indicates that CR GN infections in high-risk patients are associated with increased mortality, emphasizing the need for antimicrobial stewardship and infection control in hospitals which treat high-risk patients and for the development of effective antimicrobials with favorable efficacy and safety profiles for the treatment of CR GN infections.","Avendano, Esther E.; Raman, Gowri; Chan, Jeffrey; McCann, Eilish",Antimicrob Resist Infect Control,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7720068/,259

We then compare the performance of the Next Likely Destination model in a real-life consumer study with 35,000 actual airline customers. In the user study, the model obtains a 51% predictive accuracy. What happened? The Individual Behavior Framework theory provides insights into possibly explaining this inconsistency in evaluation outcomes.

This was in response to the implementation of new COVID-19 specific guidelines released by ENT UK and to explore factors relating to unscheduled re-presentations discharges direct from the Emergency Department (ED). METHODS: Consecutive patients with suspected tonsillitis or quinsy, aged 18 or over, and referred to ENT in secondary care were eligible for inclusion. Data was collected, using a standardised electronic case report form, relating to patient demographics, COVID-19 status, clinicians’ grade, assessment and interventions. Each case was followed-up for 10 days to assess predictors of unscheduled re-presentation after discharge direct from the ED. RESULTS: 83 centres submitted 765 tonsillitis and 416 quinsy cases. 54.4% of tonsillitis cases and 45.3% of quinsy were discharged directly from the ED. 9.6% of tonsillitis and 10.3% of quinsy discharges re-presented within 10 days, compared to 9.7% and 10.6% for those initially admitted. IV steroids were given to 67.0% of tonsillitis patients and 73.6% of quinsy. 77.2% of quinsy patients underwent drainage during their initial presentation, but there was no significant difference in re-presentation rate in those drained vs not-drained (p = 0.85). Univariable logistic regression showed no significant predictors of re-presentation within 10 days. CONCLUSION: Management of tonsillitis and quinsy was affected during the initial peak of the pandemic, with a shift towards outpatient care. Some patients who may previously have been admitted to hospital may be safely discharged from the ED.","Rocke, John",BJS Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8083388/,259

56966,Characteristics of Musculoskeletal Involvement in Pediatric Patients with Disseminated Sepsis in a Tertiary Care Center,2021-08-21,"Suicide has become a serious social health issue in modern society. Suicidal ideation is people’s thoughts about committing or planning suicide. Many factors, such as long-term exposure to negative feelings or life events, can lead to suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. Among these approaches to suicide prevention, early detection of suicidal ideation is one of the most effective ways. Using social networking services provides a platform for people to express their sufferings and feelings in the real world, which provides a source for a deeper investigation into models and approaches for the detection of suicidal intent to enable prevention. This paper addresses the early detection of suicide ideation through the associative classification approach applied to Twitter social media. However, since the number of suicide intention tweets is tiny compared to the number of all the tweets, this leads us to an imbalanced classification problem, in which, the minority class (suicide intention) is more important than the majority class (no suicide intention). In such a situation, classical classifiers usually yield very inaccurate results regarding minor classes, since they can easily discover rules predicting the majority class and overlook those related to the minor. This paper aims to contribute to this line of research by introducing a new interestingness measure to enhance the classification process. This measure highlights the two classes regardless of their imbalanced distribution. Carried out experiments proved that the adapted CBA outweighs in terms of prediction accuracy the original one, and other pioneering baseline classification approaches.","Ben Hassine, Mohamed Ali; Abdellatif, Safa; Ben Yahia, Sadok",Computing,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8370663/,259

To disentangle the forces that generated this outcome, we construct a model that is consistent with the heterogeneous impact of the COVID recession on low- and high-income people. According to our model, two-thirds of the inequality in COVID deaths reflect preexisting inequality in comorbidity rates and access to quality health care. The remaining third stems from the fact that low-income people work in occupations where the risk of infection is high. Our model also implies that the rise in income inequality generated by the COVID epidemic reflects the nature of the goods that low-income people produce. Finally, we assess the health–income trade-offs associated with fiscal transfers to the poor and mandatory containment policies.","Eichenbaum, Martin S.; Rebelo, Sergio; Trabandt, Mathias",IMF Econ Rev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8480277/,259

Cerebral oxygen saturation monitoring in pediatric cardiopulmonary resuscitation patients in the emergency settings: A small descriptive study. Turk J Pediatr 2017; 59: 642-647. Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a new technology for monitoring cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). The use of NIRS has advantages in monitoring cerebral oxygenation in cardiac arrest patients. The aim of this study was to describe cerebral regional oxygen saturation (CrSO < sub > 2 < /sub > ) values in a small cohort of pediatric out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients and to determine if there is an association with CrSO < sub > 2 < /sub > and return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). All the out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients admitted to our pediatric emergency department were included in this prospective study. All patients were monitored through NIRS in addition to standard monitoring during CPR. All cerebral rSO < sub > 2 < /sub > measurements were obtained with an INVOS 5100C cerebral/somatic oximeter. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed according to the Pediatric Advanced Life Support 2010 guidelines. The patients were classified as ROSC and non - ROSC. Ten patients were included in this study. The median age of patients was 40.0 (14.0-88.2) months. Three (30%) of the 10 patients achieved sustained ROSC. Abrupt increase in cerebral regional oxygen saturation (CrSO < sub > 2 < /sub > ) was observed in all 3 of these patients. Minimum values of the CrSO < sub > 2 < /sub > were significantly lower and the percentage of median time with CrSO < sub > 2 < /sub > under 30% of CrSO < sub > 2 < /sub > were significantly higher in the non - ROSC group (p=0.02). Our study indicated that the patients in the non - ROSC group have lower minimum CrSO < sub > 2 < /sub > value. Additionally, abrupt increase of CrSO < sub > 2 < /sub > during CPR could be an indicator for ROSC.","Çağlar, Aykut; Er, Anıl; Ulusoy, Emel; Akgül, Fatma; Çitlenbik, Hale; Yılmaz, Durgül; Duman, Murat",The Turkish journal of pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.24953/turkjped.2017.06.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30035395/,259
62769,What to measure in biliary atresia research: study protocol for developing a core outcome set.,2021-08-12,"BACKGROUND Heterotopic ossification (HO) is a known finding after total hip arthroplasty (THA) that potentially affects clinical outcomes. The incidence of HO is related to various factors, including soft-tissue trauma, postoperative medication, surgical approach, and the surgeon's experience. Because use of the direct anterior approach (DAA) is gaining popularity, we aimed (1) to determine the incidence of HO after DAA-THA and (2) to evaluate the impact of HO on patient-reported outcomes (PROs). METHODS We retrospectively reviewed 401 THAs (67 ± 10 years old, 210 men). The incidence and grade of HO were evaluated using the Brooker classification with anteroposterior and lateral radiographs. PROs were collected with use of the Oxford Hip Score (OHS) and the Core Outcome Measures Index (COMI)-Hip and were correlated with HO grades using generalized multiple regression models. RESULTS The incidence of HO was 29.9% on the anteroposterior radiographic views (Brooker grade 1, 14.5%; grade 2, 11.1%; grade 3, 2.7%; and grade 4, 0.57%); the lateral radiographic views detected 9% additional HO when compared with the anteroposterior radiographs alone (Brooker grade 1, 8%, and grade 2, 1%). HO was more frequent in men. The American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade, age in women, and higher body mass index (BMI) in men were associated with higher HO grades. A transverse ""bikini"" incision was associated with a lower rate (4%) of Brooker grades 3 and 4 HO when compared with a longitudinal incision (12%). A Brooker grade of 0 to 3 HO did not impact outcomes. Only Brooker grade-4 HO was associated with significantly worse PROs; however, pain was not affected. CONCLUSIONS Low-grade HO after DAA-THA is not uncommon, and its rate is underestimated when anteroposterior radiographic views are evaluated without lateral views. The risk factors for developing HO in our cohort were an ASA grade of >3, male sex (especially with a high BMI), older age in women, and use of longitudinal incisions. With use of the bikini incision, patients had lower rates of severe HO, but mostly senior surgeons with more experience performed their surgery. Age, ASA grade, experience level of the surgeon, and Brooker grade-4 HO all had a significant influence on PROs. Clinically important HO (Brooker grade 4) remains rare after DAA-THR.

63372,Targeting obstetric providers in interventions for obesity and gestational weight gain: A systematic review.,2018,"Super-resolution imaging has revealed that key synaptic proteins are dynamically organized within sub-synaptic domains (SSDs). To examine how different inhibitory receptors are regulated, we carried out dual-color direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM) of GlyRs and GABAA Rs at mixed inhibitory synapses in spinal cord neurons. We show that endogenous GlyRs and GABAA Rs as well as their common scaffold protein gephyrin form SSDs that align with pre-synaptic RIM1/2, thus creating trans-synaptic nanocolumns. Strikingly, GlyRs and GABAA Rs occupy different sub-synaptic spaces, exhibiting only a partial overlap at mixed inhibitory synapses. When network activity is increased by 4-aminopyridine treatment, the GABAA R copy numbers and the number of GABAA R SSDs are reduced, while GlyRs remain largely unchanged. This differential regulation is likely the result of changes in gephyrin phosphorylation that preferentially occurs outside of SSDs. The activity-dependent regulation of GABAA Rs versus GlyRs suggests that different signaling pathways control the receptors' sub-synaptic clustering.

The vast majority of proximal lesions in tandem occlusive cases involve the extracranial internal carotid artery, although the lesion can theoretically exist anywhere along the carotid artery pathway, including the common carotid ostium. Summary To the best of our knowledge, only 1 report describes common carotid artery ostial lesions in the setting of acute ischemic stroke due to tandem occlusions, in which the authors describe an anterograde treatment paradigm. We present the first 2 cases of acute ischemic stroke secondary to common carotid ostial disease with tandem intracranial occlusion, treated with intracranial thrombectomy followed by subsequent staged balloon-mounted stenting of the common carotid ostium. We review the pathophysiology of tandem occlusions, the controversy surrounding treatment techniques, and various approaches used in the treatment of ostial occlusive lesions. Key Message In certain situations where acute carotid stenting is not safe or technically possible, immediate intracranial thrombectomy with a subsequent staged balloon-mounted stenting of the ostial lesion may be a reasonable and safe option.","Amuluru, Krishna; Al-Mufti, Fawaz; Romero, Charles E",Interventional neurology,https://doi.org/10.1159/000490584; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30410523/,259

Experience with NIV as the ceiling of treatment in severely compromised novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients is lacking. METHODS We evaluated 159 patients with COVID-19-related acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS), 38 of whom with NIV as the ceiling of treatment, admitted to an ordinary ward and treated with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and respiratory physiotherapy. Treatment failure and death were correlated with clinical and laboratory parameters in the whole cohort and in patients with NIV as the ceiling of treatment. RESULTS Patients who had NIV as the ceiling of treatment were elderly, with a low BMI and a high burden of comorbidities, showed clinical and laboratory signs of multi-organ insufficiency on admission and of rapidly deteriorating vital signs during the first week of treatment. NIV failure occurred overall in 77 (48%) patients, and 27/38 patients with NIV as the ceiling of treatment died. Congestive heart failure, chronic benign haematological diseases and inability/refusal to receive respiratory physiotherapy were independently associated to NIV failure and mortality. Need for increased positive end-expiratory pressures and low platelets were associated with NIV failure. Death was associated to cerebrovascular disease, need for CPAP cycles longer than 12h and, in the subgroup of patients with NIV as the ceiling of treatment, was heralded by vital sign deterioration within 48 h.

SP methodology has been studied with practicing genetic counselors; however, there is minimal empirical evidence characterizing its use in genetic counseling (GC) education. The Accreditation Council for Genetic Counseling (ACGC) Standards of Accreditation for Graduate Programs in Genetic Counseling include SP sessions as one way to achieve up to 20% of the 50 participatory cases required for graduation. The purpose of the current project was to determine the scope, frequency, and timing of SP methodology in ACGC-accredited programs to establish baseline usage, which happened prior to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. A 40-item investigator-created survey was developed to document the scope and frequency of SP use among programs. The survey was distributed through the Association of Genetic Counseling Program Directors' (AGCPD) listserv to 43 accredited and 6 programs under development. Surveys were analyzed from 25 accredited programs (response rate = 58%). Seventeen of these programs report inclusion of SP methodology in the curricula (68%), of which 13 report working with an established SP program. SPs are used predominantly for role-plays (70.6%), individualized instruction and remediation (29.4%), and for other reasons such as lecture demonstration, final examinations, practicing skills, and assessing students' goals. Sixteen of the participating programs use SPs to give GC students experience disclosing positive test results. Other details vary among the GC programs including the use of trained SPs, volunteer or paid SPs, actors with and without SP training, or GC students acting as patients. This study demonstrates that GC program SP experiences differ, but are largely viewed as valuable by the programs. Many GC programs report using SP encounters to create multiple opportunities for students to practice and refine clinical skills similar to SPs in medical school.","Kessler, Lisa Jay; LaMarra, Denise; MacFarlane, Ian M; Heller, Melissa; Valverde, Kathleen D",Journal of genetic counseling,https://doi.org/10.1002/jgc4.1335; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33025686/,259

This study aimed to develop a Nurses' Occupational Stressor Scale (NOSS) with high reliability and validity. Candidate questions for the NOSS were generated by expert consensus following focus group feedback, and were used to survey in 2013. A shorter version was then developed after examination for validity and reproducibility in 2014. The accuracy of the short version of the NOSS for predicting nurses' stress levels was evaluated based on receiver operating characteristic curves to compare existing instruments for measuring stress outcomes, namely personal burnout, client-related burnout, job dissatisfaction, and intention to leave. Examination for validity and reproducibility yielded a shorter version of NOSS with only 21 items was considered sufficient for measuring stressors in nurses' work environments. Nine subscales were included: (1) work demands, (2) work-family conflict, (3) insufficient support from coworkers or caregivers, (4) workplace violence and bullying, (5) organizational issues, (6) occupational hazards, (7) difficulty taking leave, (8) powerlessness, and (9) unmet basic physiological needs. The 21-item NOSS proved to have high concurrent and construct validity. The correlation coefficients of the subscales for test-retest reliability ranged from 0.71 to 0.83.

A systematic review protocol.,2018,"OBJECTIVE Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) rehabilitation trials use exclusion criteria, which may limit their generalizability in practice. We investigated whether patients seen in routine practice who meet common exclusion criteria recover differently from TKA compared to research-eligible patients. We hypothesized that research-ineligible patients would demonstrate poorer average postoperative function and slower rate of functional recovery compared to research-eligible patients. METHODS Patient characteristics and exclusion criteria were extracted and summarized from trials included in the three most recent systematic reviews of TKA rehabilitation. Trial participant characteristics were compared to a clinical dataset of patient outcomes collected in routine TKA rehabilitation. Where possible, individual exclusion criterion from the trials were applied to the clinical dataset to determine ""eligible"" and ""ineligible"" groups for research participation. Postoperative functional outcomes including the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) and Timed Up and Go (TUG) were compared between ""eligible"" and ""ineligible"" groups using mixed effects models. RESULTS 2,528 participants from 27 trials were compared to 474 patients from the clinical dataset. Research participants were older, with lower Body Mass Index than patients in the clinical dataset. Many patients in the clinical dataset would be ""ineligible"" for research participation based upon common exclusion criteria from the trials. Differences were observed in average postoperative functioning between some ""eligible"" and ""ineligible"" groups in the clinical dataset. However, no differences were observed in functional recovery rate between groups, except for patients with diabetes whose TUG recovered more slowly than their ""eligible"" counterparts. CONCLUSIONS Many patients in the clinical dataset were ""ineligible"" for research participation based upon common TKA rehabilitation trial exclusion criteria. However, the postoperative recovery rate did not differ between ""eligible"" and ""ineligible"" groups based on individual exclusion criterion-except for individuals with diabetes.

Substances found by death scene investigators at the scene of the fatal overdose (57 samples) were tested using high-pressure liquid chromatography mass-spectrometry (LC-MS) technology. We compared toxicology and LC-MS results to understand whether substances contributing to overdose were found in combination or separately at the scene of the overdose. RESULTS Comparing toxicology reports with LC-MS results from substances found at the scene of overdose deaths involving opioids and stimulants reveal that deaths are largely the result of the co-use of opioids and stimulants, rather than use of stimulants combined with opioids. CONCLUSIONS Collecting and testing physical samples from fatal overdose scenes and comparing these to post-mortem toxicology results is a new way to examine polydrug use patterns.

This study compares the diagnostic accuracy of three-dimensional time-of-flight MR angiography (3D-TOF-MRA) and contrast-enhanced MRA (CE-MRA) at 3 T for the evaluation of aneurysm occlusion and parent artery patency after flow diversion treatment, with digital subtraction angiography (DSA) as the gold standard. MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients treated with flow diverters between January 2009 and January 2013 followed by MRA at 3 T (3D-TOF-MRA and CE-MRA) and DSA within a 48 h period were included in a prospective single-center study. Aneurysm occlusion was assessed with full and simplified Montreal scales and parent artery patency with three-grade and two-grade scales. RESULTS Twenty-two patients harboring 23 treated aneurysms were included. Interobserver agreement using simplified scales for occlusion (Montreal) and parent artery patency were higher for DSA (0.88 and 0.61) and CE-MRA (0.74 and 0.55) than for 3D-TOF-MRA (0.51 and 0.02). Intermodality agreement was higher for CE-MRA (0.88 and 0.32) than for 3D-TOF-MRA (0.59 and 0.11). CE-MRA yielded better accuracy than 3D-TOF-MRA for aneurysm remnant detection (sensitivity 83% vs 50%; specificity 100% vs 100%) and for the status of the parent artery (specificity 63% vs 32%; sensitivity 100% vs 100%). CONCLUSIONS At 3 T, CE-MRA is superior to 3D-TOF-MRA for the evaluation of aneurysm occlusion and parent artery patency after flow diversion treatment.

Mutations in TSC1 or TSC2 was proved to be associated with these conditions. METHODS Gene-panel Sequence of NGS was used to detect the mutation in a Chinese family. The research further investigates whether aberrant splicing and nonsense-mediated mRNA degradation (NMD) could serve as a mechanism cause by TSC1 mutation. MINI-Gene assay apply by pcMINI-TSC1wt/mut plasmids delivered in HeLa and 293T cell lines. Recombinant plasmids expressing wild-type and mutant-type EGFP-TSC1 were constructed and transiently transfected into human embryonic kidney cells 293T by lipofectamine. Real-time PCR and Western Blot were performed to analyze the expression of mRNAs and proteins of EGFP-TSC1 and NMD factor UPF1. RESULTS The gene test verified a novel heterozygous TSC1 frameshift mutation (TSC1 c.1550_1551del) in the proband and her mother. From MINI-Gene assay, the agarose gel showed that both the mutant and wild-type mRNA possess two main bands, indicating two splicing modes, named band A and B, respectively. The mutation c.1550_1551del has not produced new splicing site, but there is a selective splicing in varying degree significantly after mutation. On the contrary, function validation assay showed that cells transfected with the mutant TSC1 plasmids expressed significantly lower TSC1 in mRNAs and proteins levels, compared with the wild-type TSC1 plasmid transfection. A translation inhibitor cycloheximide and small interfering RNA of UPF1 (siRNA-UPF1) increased mRNA or protein expression of TSC1 significantly in cells transfected with the mutant plasmids. CONCLUSION Our study demonstrated that the novel TSC1 frameshift mutation (TSC1 c.1550_1551del) trigger aberrant splicing and NMD simultaneously, causing decrease of hamartin, then, leading to tuberous sclerosis complex formation.","Qiu, Cong; Li, Chengyan; Tong, Xiaoyun; Dai, Luoyang; Liu, Wenda; Xie, Yulie; Zhang, Qimei; Yang, Guohua; Li, Tao",Molecular genetics & genomic medicine,https://doi.org/10.1002/mgg3.1410; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32735081/,259

Here, we present a theory that fully specifies, without any adjustable parameters, the optimal design of a canonical sensing system, in terms of two elementary design principles: (1) there exists an optimal integration time, which is determined by the input statistics and the number of receptors; (2) in the optimally designed system, the number of independent concentration measurements as set by the number of receptors and the optimal integration time, equals the number of readout molecules that store these measurements, and equals the work to store these measurements reliably; no resource is then in excess and hence wasted. Applying our theory to the E.coli chemotaxis system indicates that its integration time is not only optimal for sensing shallow gradients, but also necessary to enable navigation in these gradients.","Malaguti, Giulia; Ten Wolde, Pieter Rein",eLife,https://doi.org/10.7554/elife.62574; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33594978/,259
76173,Time series analysis of California's prescription monitoring program: impact on prescribing and multiple provider episodes.,2012,"BACKGROUND Epidermoid and dermoid cysts are uncommon entities that belong in the differential diagnosis of ventral skull base lesions. The endoscopic endonasal approach is an attractive option for management of these lesions with limited morbidity. The clinical characteristics and management course from our experience is reviewed along with the relevant literature. METHODS A prospective database of endoscopic endonasal skull base cases performed since 2003 at a tertiary referral center was reviewed for cases involving keratinaceous lesions. Data on the pathology, radiology and management of the disease was reviewed. A search of pertinent literature using Medline was performed to complement the discussion. RESULTS Three cases of intracranial keratinaceous cysts successfully managed with the endoscopic endonasal approach. All cases presented with headache, and 1 case presented with bitemporal hemianopsia. Characteristic appearance on magnetic resonance imaging was seen in each case. All lesions were intradural with variable involvement of the suprasellar, prepontine, and premedullary cisterns. Total resection was achieved in 2 cases and near total resection in 1 case. Postoperative cerebrospinal fluid leak occurred in one case, which was controlled after revision surgery using the ""gasket-seal"" technique. There were no cranial nerve palsies or vascular events. CONCLUSION The endoscopic endonasal approach allows the rhinologic surgeon to access the ventral midline skull base for the successful management of keratinaceous cysts without major complications.","McCoul, Edward D; Chow, Samuel; Lee, Dennis L Y; Anand, Vijay K; Schwartz, Theodore H",International forum of allergy & rhinology,https://doi.org/10.1002/alr.21005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22213716/,259
76473,Proposed pathway for patients undergoing enhanced recovery after spinal surgery: protocol for a systematic review.,2020-02-21,"PURPOSE The pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has infected over 43 million people resulting in over 1 million deaths. Approximately 2% of cases in the United States are children, and in most cases the child is either asymptomatic or has mild symptoms. However, some pediatric cases can present with Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS-C). Understanding the epidemiology, clinical presentation, and management of MIS-C related to SARS-CoV-2 will help to streamline early diagnosis and treatment, particularly in pediatric patients with complex medical conditions. METHODS This scoping review adopted methods from the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) manual for evidence synthesis and preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses extension for scoping reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines. Primary studies of patients meeting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria for MIS-C from December 31st, 2019 to Oct 5th, 2020 were identified using PubMed and Scopus. Articles were screened for eligibility, and data collection was conducted on those fulfilling inclusion criteria. RESULTS Of 417 studies identified, 57 met inclusion criteria, accounting for 875 patients from 15 countries. Globally, 57% of children affected with MIS-C were males. The median age was 9 years old, ranging from 6 months to 21 years. Forty-five percent of the patients had underlying comorbidities including obesity and lung disease. Fever, conjunctivitis and GI symptoms were common. Most MIS-C patients had high biomarkers including troponin I, N-terminal prohormone of B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), D-dimer, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), white blood cells (WBCs), interleukin 6 (IL-6), procalcitonin, and ferritin. The treatment for most patients included IVIG and inotropic support. CONCLUSION MIS-C can be a unique and potentially life-threatening manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 in children and often requires medical intervention.","Panigrahy, Neha; Policarpio, Joseph; Ramanathan, Rahul",Journal of pediatric rehabilitation medicine,https://doi.org/10.3233/prm-200794; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33252101/,259

Yet they spend heavily on their response. We describe a set of key functional areas for investment and action in health EDRM, and calculate the costs needed to establish and operate basic health EDRM services in low- and middle-income countries, focusing on management of epidemics and disasters from natural hazards.We find that health EDRM costs are affordable for most governments. They range from an additional US$4.33 capital and US$4.16 annual recurrent costs per capita in low-income countries to US$1.35 capital to US$1.41 recurrent costs in upper middle-income countries. These costs pale in comparison to the costs of not acting-the direct and indirect costs of epidemics and other emergencies from natural hazards are more than 20-fold higher.We also examine options for the institutional arrangements needed to design and implement health EDRM. We discuss the need for creating adaptive institutions, strengthening capacities of countries, communities and health systems for managing risks of emergencies, using ""all-of-society"" and ""all-of-state institutions"" approaches, and applying lessons about rules and regulations, behavioral norms, and organizational structures to better implement health EDRM. The economic and social value, and the feasibility of institutional options for implementing health EDRM systems should compel governments to invest in these common goods for health that strengthen national health security.","Peters, David H; Hanssen, Odd; Gutierrez, Jose; Abrahams, Jonathan; Nyenswah, Tolbert",Health systems and reform,https://doi.org/10.1080/23288604.2019.1660104; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661356/,259

79285,"Capsule Commentary on Ganguli et al., Ebola Risk and Preparedness: A National Survey of Internists.",2016,"BACKGROUND Weight regain after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is increasingly reported in the bariatric literature. Laparoscopic sleeve reduction of the gastrojejunal complex is a surgical option to revise a dilated gastric pouch. We report our short-term results. METHODS Sleeve reduction entails serial firing of a linear stapler along the jejunal alimentary limb, across the gastric pouch and towards the left crus, with a bougie in place, thus, creating a new 20-25-cm reduced gastrojejunal complex. Data analyzed included age, body mass index (BMI), excess weight loss (EWL), comorbidity resolution, and any other simultaneous operative procedures. RESULTS Fourteen patients were identified, all done laparoscopically. Nine underwent gastrojejunal sleeve reduction alone and five underwent additional lengthening of the Roux limb. There were no mortalities. Mean age at revision was 43 years (31-59). Mean BMI and EWL prior to revision were 35.5 ± 4.0 kg/m² and 48.9 ± 15.8%, respectively. Nine of 14 patients (64%) had obesity-related comorbidities prior to the revision. Average BMI decrease was 2.7 kg/m². Post-revision mean BMI and %EWL were 32.9 ± 4.7 kg/m² and 12.0 ± 13.9%, respectively, with mean follow-up of 12 months. Three of nine patients (33%) experienced improvement and/or resolution of comorbidities. We did not find a significant difference between pre-and post-revision mean BMI and %EWL (p = 0.13) even after separately evaluating those patients who underwent Roux limb lengthening (p = 0.16). CONCLUSION For RYGB patients who regained weight, laparoscopic gastrojejunal sleeve reduction does not seem to offer a major therapeutic benefit. Additional malabsorptive Roux lengthening also does not provide a significant benefit. Other options should be considered, such as placing a band on the gastric pouch or conversion to duodenal switch.","Parikh, Manish; Heacock, Laura; Gagner, Michel",Obesity surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-010-0274-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20835779/,259

METHODS AND RESULTS This was a prospective single-centre study to evaluate the technical and clinical success of proximal protection devices as the first choice for embolic protection in symptomatic (≥50%) and asymptomatic (≥70%) carotid stenosis. Proximal protection devices were used for embolic protection in 124 consecutive patients. No patients were excluded for anatomical reasons. The GORE Flow Reversal System (W.L. Gore, Flagstaff, AZ, USA) was used in 92 patients, and the Mo.Ma Ultra device (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA) in 32 patients. Follow-up duration was 30 days. Mean age was 71±8 years. Seventy-five percent of patients were male (n=93). Twenty-six of 124 (21%) treated stenoses were symptomatic. Technical success was achieved in 122 of 124 cases (98%). Due to anatomical conditions, in two patients flow reversal could not be established. In both cases additional distal filter devices were used. Carotid stenting was successful in 124 lesions (100%). Ten patients (8.1%) had contraindications to flow reversal (three high-grade ostial stenoses of the external carotid artery, seven contralateral occlusions of the internal carotid artery) in none of whom complications occurred. There were no procedural neurologic events. Within 30 days of follow-up, one patient had an ischaemic stroke (on day 11). CONCLUSIONS Proximal protection is a safe method as the first choice for embolic protection. It can be used with a high rate of technical success.","Hornung, Marius; Bertog, Stefan C; Franke, Jennifer; Id, Dani; Grunwald, Iris; Sievert, Horst",EuroIntervention : journal of EuroPCR in collaboration with the Working Group on Interventional Cardiology of the European Society of Cardiology,https://doi.org/10.4244/eijy14m07_10; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25042420/,259
79744,Annals Graphic Medicine - What I Learned From COVID-19 (Until Now).,2020-05-12,"Objective The treatment of laryngotracheal stenosis is a major therapeutic challenge. Various treatments include observation, medical management, and surgical management. The most effective surgical management is resection and reconstruction. To the authors' knowledge, no reports have described the use of xenogenic acellular dermal matrix (ADM) for laryngotracheal stenosis. Methods A 27-year-old man presented with hemoptysis of the neck due to a traffic accident. Emergency orotracheal intubation was performed. Tracheostomy was then performed under local anesthesia. Computed tomography revealed fractures of the right thyroid cartilage and posterior arc of the cricoid cartilage and stenosis of the subglottis and first and second tracheal rings. We used a composite hyoid-sternohyoid osseomuscular flap with xenogenic ADM and a straight silicone tube as a lumen stent to reconstruct the laryngotracheal stenosis. Results Surgical recovery was uneventful. The tracheotomy opening was changed to a metal tube 5 days postoperatively. Four months postoperatively, the silicone tube was endoscopically removed under local anesthesia. The patient was decannulated 20 days later. The patient satisfied with his voice, respiration, and deglutition at the 16-month postoperative follow-up. Conclusion The use of ADM for laryngotracheal stenosis may reduce the growth of granulation tissues and promote the repair process.","Yang, Hang; Chen, Zhe; Zhou, Shui-Hong; Wang, Qin-Yin; Weng, Li-Xia; Wang, Fang; Wu, Ting-Ting; Zhou, Min-Li; Bao, Yang-Yang",The Journal of international medical research,https://doi.org/10.1177/0300060517705985; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28480810/,259

The incidence and clinical-symptomatic manifestation of COVID-19 is different between northern and southern Italy. This study aims to evaluate the onset of alteration of smell and taste in asymptomatic and symptomatic patients in Sicily (extreme south of Italy). METHODS This prospective cross-sectional study was performed on asymptomatic and symptomatic COVID-19 patients tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) from May 1 to May 15, 2020. A questionnaire was used for evaluating the prevalence of smell and taste disorders in COVID-19 patients before performing nasopharyngeal swab. RESULTS Of the total 292 patients, 242 (83.2%) were negative for SARS-CoV-2 and 50 were positive (16.8%). Twenty-six of the 50 (52%) SARS-CoV-2 positive patients reported smell/taste disorders. Twenty-eight of the 50 (57.1%) SARS-CoV-2 positive patients were hospitalized (group A), and 22 (42.9%) were nonhospitalized (group B). The mean age in group A and group B was 45.4 ± 13.7 years and 57.0 ± 15.0, respectively (P = .007). The symptoms reported by hospitalized patients were fever (71.4%), cough (64.2%), fatigue (82.1%), and dyspnea (100%), while in nonhospitalized patients, the most reported symptoms were sore throat (72.7%), rhinorrhea (77.2%), and altered smell (81.8%). Anosmia/hyposmia reported in group A and group B was 28.5% and 81.8%, respectively (P = .001).

It is important to diagnose the disease in the early stages. Current methods detect the disease with low specificity. Examining the expression of genes responsible for disease and their epigenetic regulators are good tools in this regard. MATERIAL AND METHODS In this prospective case-control study, 40 Iranian patients with cancer, 40 Iranian patients with prostate hyperplasia, and 40 control samples were examined. After blood sampling from each individual, RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis, GSTP1, HDAC, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B expressions were measured in three understudy groups using specific primers and Real-Time PCR method. RESULTS A reverse correlation was identified between loss of GSTP1 expression and overexpression of HDAC, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B (P value < 0.0001) with a beneficial pattern of cancer development with high efficiency. The significant decrease of GSTP1 expression in patients in comparison to the healthy controls and the elevated expression levels of the studied epigenetic regulators in PCA and BPH samples indicate the impact of the regulators on GSTP1 expression activity. CONCLUSION This study showed that the measurement of combined GSTP1 and its epigenetic regulators' expression could be used as suitable genetic markers for the detection and separation of healthy individuals from prostatic patient groups in the Iranian population. However, a similar study in a larger population of case and control could help us to distinguish between normal, benign, and malignant conditions.","Mohammadi, Mahan; Irani, Shiva; Salahshourifar, Iman; Hosseini, Jalil; Moradi, Afshin; Pouresmaeili, Farkhondeh",Human antibodies,https://doi.org/10.3233/hab-200424; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32831196/,259
80323,"Quality of Reporting on Guideline, Protocol, or Algorithm Implementation in Adult Trauma Centers: A Systematic Review.",2019,"ABSTRACT The weak association between disability levels and ""peripheral"" (i.e., knee) findings suggests that central nervous system alterations may contribute to the pathophysiology of knee osteoarthritis (KOA). Here, we evaluated brain metabolite alterations in KOA patients, before and after total knee arthroplasty (TKA), using 1H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). Thirty-four pre-surgical KOA patients and 13 healthy controls were scanned using a PRESS sequence (TE=30ms, TR=1.7s, voxel size=15x15x15mm). Additionally, 13 patients were re-scanned 4.1±1.6 (mean±SD) weeks post-TKA. When using Creatine (Cr)-normalized levels, pre-surgical KOA patients demonstrated lower N-acetylaspartate (NAA) (p<0.001), and higher myoinositol (mIns) (p<0.001), and lower Choline (Cho) (p<0.05) compared to healthy controls. The mIns levels were positively correlated with pain severity scores (r=0.37, p<0.05). These effects reached statistical significance also using water-referenced concentrations, except for the Cho group differences (p≥0.067). Post-TKA, patients demonstrated an increase in NAA (p<0.01), which returned to the levels of healthy controls (p>0.05), irrespective of metric. Additionally, patients demonstrated post-surgical increases in Cr-normalized (p<0.001), but not water-referenced mIns, which were proportional to the NAA/Cr increases (r=0.61, p<0.05). Because mIns is commonly regarded as a glial marker, our results are suggestive of a possible dual role for neuroinflammation in KOA pain and post-TKA recovery. Moreover, the apparent post-surgical normalization of NAA a putative marker of neuronal integrity might implicate mitochondrial dysfunction, rather than neurodegenerative processes, as a plausible pathophysiological mechanism in KOA. More broadly, our results add to a growing body of literature suggesting that some pain-related brain alterations can be reversed after peripheral surgical treatment.","Weerasekera, Akila; Morrissey, Erin; Kim, Minhae; Saha, Atreyi; Lin, Yang; Alshelh, Zeynab; Torrado-Carvajal, Angel; Albrecht, Daniel; Akeju, Oluwaseun; Kwon, Young-Min; Bedair, Hany; Chen, Antonia F; Napadow, Vitaly; Schreiber, Kristin; Ratai, Eva-Maria; Edwards, Robert R; Loggia, Marco L",Pain,https://doi.org/10.1097/j.pain.0000000000002198; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33470749/,259

Primary study outcomes were 8-month change in lumbar spine (LS) and total hip (TH) bone mineral density (BMD). Healthy postmenopausal women with low bone mass (T-score ≤ -1.0) on or off stable doses (≥12 months) of antiresorptive medication were recruited. A total of 115 women (aged 63.6 ± 0.7 years; body mass index [BMI] 25.5 kg/m2 ; femoral neck [FN] T-score -1.8 ± 0.1) were randomly allocated to 8-month, twice-weekly, 40-minute HiRIT (5 sets of 5 repetitions, >80% to 85% 1 repetition maximum) or BB (low-intensity, Pilates-based training), stratified by medication intake, resulting in four groups: HiRIT (n = 42), BB (n = 44), HiRIT-med (n = 15), BB-med (n = 14). HiRIT improved LS BMD (1.9 ± 0.3% versus 0.1 ± 0.4%, p < 0.001) and stature (0.2 ± 0.1 cm versus -0.0 ± 0.1 cm, p = 0.004) more than BB. Both programs improved functional performance, but HiRIT effects were larger for leg and back muscle strength and the five times sit-to-stand test (p < 0.05). There was a positive relationship between maximum weight lifted and changes in LS BMD and muscle strength in the HiRIT groups. Exploratory analyses suggest antiresorptive medication may enhance exercise efficacy at the proximal femur and lumbar spine. Exercise compliance was good (82.4 ± 1.3%) and both programs were well tolerated (7 adverse events: HiRIT 4; BB 3). HiRIT improved indices of fracture risk significantly more than Buff Bones®.

82527,Recommendations for caring for patients with severe and nonsevere COVID-19.,2020-07-21,"The SARS-CoV-2 infection is particularly associated with negative outcomes (i.e., serious disease, death) in frail older people, independently of where they live. Furthermore, the period of pandemic (with its lockdowns, social distancing, fragmentation of care…) has significantly changed the environment in which older people live. It is likely that, when the pandemic will be over, an acceleration of the aging process will be observed for many persons, independently of whether they have been infected or not by the SARS-CoV-2. The World report on ageing and health, published by the World Health Organization, proposes the concept of intrinsic capacity (i.e., the composite of all the physical and mental capacities of the individual) as central for healthy ageing. The routine assessment of biological age through constructs such as intrinsic capacity might have allowed a better understanding of the functional trajectories and vulnerabilities of the individual, even during a catastrophic event as the one we are currently living. In the present article, we describe how COVID-19 has affected the persons' intrinsic capacity, and how the wide adoption of the intrinsic capacity model may support the modernization of our systems and bring them closer to the individual.","Nestola, T; Orlandini, L; Beard, J R; Cesari, M","The journal of nutrition, health & aging",https://doi.org/10.1007/s12603-020-1397-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32744562/,259

The present study summarizes the challenges that an orthopedic surgeon is confronting during the surgical treatment of fracture patients with concomitant COVID-19 infection. Methods Demographic and fracture related data of 13 fracture patients with concomitant COVID-19 infection who were treated with surgery was collected from three trauma centers in Tehran and Kermanshah cities from 21, February 2020 to April 3, 2020. Results All patients were male with mean age of 38.6±19.5 years. Eight patients had high energy fracture and seven patients had multiple fractures and trauma. Wrist and hand were the common sites of fracture following hip and pelvis. The mean interval time period between the diagnosis of COVID-19 infection and surgery was 2.3±1.5 days. Before surgery, all patients except one had been admitted to the corona dedicated wards, while two patients were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). One of the ICU admitted patients died.

In January 2020, the Joint Commission endorsed a statement from the Emergency Care Research Institute citing point-of-care ultrasound as a potential hazard to patients for reasons related to training and skill verification, oversight of use, and recordkeeping and accountability mechanisms for clinical use; however, no evidence was presented to support these concerns. Existing data on point-of-care ultrasound practices in pediatric critical care settings verify that point-of-care ultrasound use continues to increase, and contrary to the concerns raised, resources are becoming increasingly available for point-of-care ultrasound use.

84328,A Systematic Review Protocol to Determine the Most Effective Strategies to Reduce Computed Tomography Usage in the Emergency Department.,2020-08-01,"BACKGROUND False claims about COVID-19 vaccines can undermine public trust in ongoing vaccination campaigns, thus posing a threat to global public health. Misinformation originating from various sources has been spreading online since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Anti-vaccine activists have also begun to utilize platforms like Twitter to promote their views. To properly understand the phenomenon of vaccine hesitancy through the lens of online social media, it is of greatest importance to gather the relevant data. OBJECTIVE In this paper, we describe a dataset of Twitter posts and Twitter accounts that publicly exhibit a strong anti-vaccine stance. The dataset is made available to the research community via our AvaxTweets dataset GitHub repository. We characterize the collected accounts in terms of prominent hashtags, shared news sources and most likely political leaning. METHODS We started the ongoing data collection on October 18, 2020, leveraging the Twitter streaming application programming interface (API) to follow a set of specific anti-vaccine related keywords. Then, we collect the historical tweets of the set of accounts that engaged in spreading anti-vaccination narratives between October 2020 and December 2020 leveraging the Academic Track Twitter API. The accounts' political leaning is estimated by measuring the political bias of the media outlets they share. RESULTS We gather two curated Twitter data collections and make them publicly available: a) a streaming keyword-centered data collection with more than 1.8 million tweets, and b) a historical account-level collection with more than 135 million tweets. The accounts engaged in the anti-vaccination narratives lean right on a political spectrum. The vaccine hesitancy is fueled by misinformation originating from websites with already questionable credibility. CONCLUSIONS The vaccine-related misinformation on social media may exacerbate the levels of vaccine hesitancy, hampering the progress toward vaccine-induced herd immunity, and potentially increase infections related to new COVID-19 variants. For these reasons, understanding vaccine hesitancy through the lens of social media is of paramount importance. Since data access is the first obstacle to attain that, we publish the dataset that can be used in studying anti-vaccine misinformation on social media and enable a better understanding of vaccine hesitancy.

In particular, the healthcare system has been subject to an enormous pressure that has surpassed its ability in many instances. Additionally, the pandemic has called for a review of our daily medical practices, including our approach to colorectal cancer management where treatment puts patients at high risk of virus exposure. Given their higher median age, patients are at an increased risk for severe symptoms and complications in cases of infection, especially in the setting of immunosuppression. Therefore, a review of the routine colorectal cancer practices is needed to minimize risk of exposure. Oncologists should weigh risk of exposure versus the patient's oncologic benefits when approaching management. In addition, treatment protocols should be modified to minimize hospital visits and admissions while maintaining the same treatment efficacy. In this review, we will focus on challenges that colorectal cancer patients face during the pandemic, while highlighting the priority in each case. We will also discuss the evidence for potential modifications to existing treatment plans that could reduce infectious exposure without compromising care.

85515,Update in Outpatient General Internal Medicine: Practice-Changing Evidence Published in 2020.,2021-03-24,"BACKGROUND Institutions across the world have observed a decrease in preterm birth during the COVID-19 pandemic. The reason for this reduction remains unknown. OBJECTIVE We sought to explore potential causes of the decrease in preterm birth exploring three hypotheses: 1. Do women who are more likely to be able to work from home incur less physical and/or emotional stress resulting in longer gestation? 2. Does the effect of COVID-19 on preterm birth vary by race? 3. Is the change provider driven? STUDY DESIGN Using a retrospective cohort of all singleton deliveries at a single tertiary care center, we compared deliveries prior to COVID-19 (1/1/2018-1/31/2020) to those occurring during the pandemic (4/1/2020-10/27/2020). Comparisons were made pre- and post-COVID using Pearson's chi-square or t-tests as appropriate. Preterm birth, defined as delivery at <37 weeks' gestation, was analyzed overall then further classified into spontaneous and indicated. The population was then stratified by: 1. Insurance type and neighborhood disadvantage, 2. Race, and 3. Provider type. Provider type was classified as within an OPC, a clinic that provides prenatal care to those eligible for Medical Assistance, compared with non-OPC. RESULTS In a population of 17,687 pre-COVID deliveries, and 5,396 post-COVID deliveries, there was a significant decrease in overall preterm birth (11.1 vs. 10.1%; p=0.039). Both spontaneous and indicated preterm deliveries decreased in the full population. When stratified, decreases in spontaneous preterm birth pre- versus post-COVID, were limited to deliveries to women from more advantaged neighborhoods (most advantaged: 4.4 vs. 3.8%; least advantaged: 7.2 vs. 7.4%), white mothers (white: 5.6 vs. 4.7%; black: 6.6 vs. 7.1%), and those receiving care from non-OPC providers (non-OPC providers: 5.5 vs 4.8%; OPC-providers: 6.3 vs 6.7%). CONCLUSIONS Preterm birth has decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic. Decreases in spontaneous preterm birth were limited to deliveries in white women, living in more advantaged neighborhoods and delivered by non-OPC providers. COVID-19 response regulations may have disproportional benefits to women with more indicators of advantage.","Lemon, Lara; Edwards, Robert P; Simhan, Hyagriv N",American journal of obstetrics & gynecology MFM,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajogmf.2021.100330; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33618035/,259

Of 54 qualifying studies, we found that most used GSV to assess the neighborhood built environment, followed by health policy compliance, study site selection, and disaster preparedness. Most studies were conducted in urban areas of North America, Europe, or New Zealand, with few studies from South America or Asia and none from Africa or rural areas. Health behaviors and outcomes of interest in these studies included injury, alcohol and tobacco use, physical activity and mental health. Major strengths of using GSV imagery included low cost, ease of use, and time saved. Identified weaknesses were image resolution and spatial and temporal availability, largely in developing regions of the world. Despite important limitations, GSV is a promising tool for automated environmental assessment for health research. Currently untapped areas of health research using GSV include identification of sources of air, soil or water pollution, park design and usage, amenity design and longitudinal research on neighborhood conditions.","Rzotkiewicz, Amanda; Pearson, Amber L; Dougherty, Benjamin V; Shortridge, Ashton; Wilson, Nick",Health & place,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.healthplace.2018.07.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30015181/,259

88176,Error in methods.,2015,"KEY POINTS Abnormal activation of motoneurons in the spinal cord by sensory pathways is thought to contribute to impaired movement control and spasticity in individuals with cerebral palsy. Here we use single motor unit recordings to show how individual motoneurons in the spinal cord respond to sensory inputs in a group of participants with cerebral palsy having different degrees of motor dysfunction. In participants who had problems walking independently and required assistive devices such as wheelchairs, sensory pathways only excited motoneurons in the spinal cord. In contrast, in participants with cerebral palsy who walked independently for long distances, sensory inputs both inhibited and excited motoneurons in the spinal cord, similar to what we found in uninjured control participants. These findings demonstrate that in individuals with severe cerebral palsy, inhibitory control of motoneurons from sensory pathways is reduced and may contribute to motor dysfunction and spasticity. ABSTRACT Reduced inhibition of spinal motoneurons by sensory pathways may contribute to heightened reflex activity, spasticity and impaired motor function in individuals with cerebral palsy (CP). To measure if the activation of inhibitory post-synaptic potentials (IPSPs) by sensory inputs is reduced in CP, the tonic discharge rate of single motor units from the soleus muscle was plotted time-locked to the occurrence of a sensory stimulation to produce peri-stimulus frequencygrams (PSFs). Stimulation to the medial arch of the foot was used to activate cutaneomuscular afferents in 17 adults with bilateral spastic CP and 15 neurologically intact (NI) peers. Evidence of IPSP activation from the PSF profiles, namely a marked pause or reduction in motor unit firing rates at the onset of the cutaneomuscular reflex, was found in all NI participants but in only half of participants with CP. In the other half of the participants with CP, stimulation of cutaneomuscular afferents produced a PSF profile indicative of a pure excitatory post-synaptic potential, with firing rates increasing above the mean pre-stimulus rate for 300 ms or more. The amplitude of motoneuron inhibition during the period of IPSP activation, as measured from the surface EMG, was less in participants with poor motor function as evaluated with the Gross Motor Functional Classification System (r = 0.72, P < 0.001) and the Functional Mobility Scale (r = -0.82, P < 0.001). These findings demonstrate that in individuals with CP, reduced activation of motoneuron IPSPs by sensory inputs is associated with reduced motor function and may contribute to enhanced reflexes and spasticity in CP.","Condliffe, E G; Jeffery, D T; Emery, D J; Gorassini, M A",The Journal of physiology,https://doi.org/10.1113/jp271886; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26842905/,259

The Protein-Protein interaction analyses demonstrated the higher affinity between the SARS-CoV-2-S and ACE2 due to varieties of significant interactions between them. The computational alanine scanning mutation study has recognized the highly stabilized amino acids in the SARS-CoV-2-S RBD/ACE2 complex.

Belching is frequently reported after this procedure, but it has not been well studied in the bariatric population. This study aims to assess the changes in belching before and after sleeve gastrectomy, as measured with impedance monitoring. METHODS In a prospective study, patients underwent 24-h pH-impedance monitoring before and 3 months after LSG. Using this technique, belches can be identified. Preoperative and postoperative upper gastrointestinal symptoms were assessed using the Reflux Disease Questionnaire (RDQ). RESULTS Fifteen patients (1 M/14 F, mean age 42.2 ± 11.0 years, mean weight 134.5 ± 21.1 kg, mean BMI 46.4 ± 6.0 kg/m(2)) participated in this study. Belching occurred significantly more often after LSG, with an increase in symptom score from 2.9 ± 2.6 before to 5.3 ± 3.5 3 months after LSG (p = 0.04). The total number of gastric belches increased from 29.7 ± 11.7 before to 59.5 ± 38.3/24 h 3 months after LSG (p = 0.03). The total number of supragastric belches did not change after LSG. The number of swallows decreased from 746.9 ± 302.4 before to 555.7 ± 172.5 3 months after the procedure (p = 0.03). The number of air swallows tended to decrease (p = 0.08). Esophageal acid exposure increased significantly, from 3.7 ± 2.9 % before to 12.6 ± 10.5 % after LSG (p = 0.01). CONCLUSION Subjectively (as reported by patients) and objectively (as measured by impedance monitoring), an increase in gastric belches is seen after LSG, while the number of (air) swallows tends to decrease after the procedure and the incidence of supragastric belches remains constant. The altered anatomy as well as increased gastroesophageal reflux after LSG may play a role in the increase of belching.","Burgerhart, Jan S; van de Meeberg, Paul C; Mauritz, Femke A; Schoon, Erik J; Smulders, Johannes F; Siersema, Peter D; Smout, André J P M",Obesity surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-015-1718-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26101047/,259
89643,The Current Status of Disaster Preparedness in Canadian Trauma Centers.,2020-05-26,"Hemorrhage remains the leading cause of preventable deaths in trauma. Endovascular management of non-compressible torso hemorrhage has been at the forefront of trauma care in recent years. Since complete aortic occlusion presents serious concerns, the concept of partial aortic occlusion has gained a growing attention. Here, we present a large animal model of hemorrhagic shock to investigate the effects of a novel partial aortic balloon occlusion catheter and compare it with a catheter that works on the principles of complete aortic occlusion. Swine are anesthetized and instrumented in order to conduct controlled fixed-volume hemorrhage, and hemodynamic and physiological parameters are monitored. Following hemorrhage, aortic balloon occlusion catheters are inserted and inflated in the supraceliac aorta for 60 min, during which the animals receive whole-blood resuscitation as 20% of the total blood volume (TBV). Following balloon deflation, the animals are monitored in a critical care setting for 4 h, during which they receive fluid resuscitation and vasopressors as needed. The partial aortic balloon occlusion demonstrated improved distal mean arterial pressures (MAPs) during the balloon inflation, decreased markers of ischemia, and decreased fluid resuscitation and vasopressor use. As swine physiology and homeostatic responses following hemorrhage have been well-documented and are like those in humans, a swine hemorrhagic shock model can be used to test various treatment strategies. In addition to treating hemorrhage, aortic balloon occlusion catheters have become popular for their role in cardiac arrest, cardiac and vascular surgery, and other high-risk elective surgical procedures.","Williams, Aaron M; Bhatti, Umar F; Dennahy, Isabel S; Chtraklin, Kiril; Chang, Panpan; Graham, Nathan J; Baccouche, Basil M; Roy, Shalini; Harajli, Mohammed; Zhou, Jing; Nikolian, Vahagn C; Deng, Qiufang; Tian, Yuzi; Liu, Baoling; Li, Yongqing; Hays, Gregory L; Hays, Julia L; Alam, Hasan B",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,https://doi.org/10.3791/58284; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30199035/,259

Anti-infectious and/or anti-inflammatory treatments must be tested on a suitable animal model. Mice models do not replicate several aspects of human lung disease. This is particularly true for cystic fibrosis (CF), which has led the scientific community to a search for new animal models. We have shown that mice are not appropriate for characterizing drugs targeting neutrophil-dependent inflammation and that pig neutrophils and their NSPs are similar to their human homologues. We induced acute neutrophilic inflammatory responses in pig lungs using Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic respiratory pathogen. Blood samples, nasal swabs and bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALFs) were collected at 0, 3, 6 and 24 h post-insfection (p.i.) and biochemical parameters, serum and BAL cytokines, bacterial cultures and neutrophil activity were evaluated. The release of proinflammatory mediators, biochemical and hematological blood parameters, cell recruitment and bronchial reactivity, peaked at 6h p.i.. We also used synthetic substrates specific for human neutrophil proteases to show that the activity of pig NSPs in BALFs increased. These proteases were also detected at the surface of lung neutrophils using anti-human NSP antibodies. Pseudomonas aeruginosa-induced lung infection in pigs results in a neutrophilic response similar to that described for cystic fibrosis and ventilator-associated pneumonia in humans. Altogether, this indicates that the pig is an appropriate model for testing anti-infectious and/or anti-inflammatory drugs to combat adverse proteolytic effects of neutrophil in human lung diseases.","Chevaleyre, Claire; Riou, Mickaël; Bréa, Déborah; Vandebrouck, Clarisse; Barc, Céline; Pezant, Jérémy; Melo, Sandrine; Olivier, Michel; Delaunay, Rémy; Boulesteix, Olivier; Berthon, Patricia; Rossignol, Christelle; Burlaud Gaillard, Julien; Becq, Frédéric; Gauthier, Francis; Si-Tahar, Mustapha; Meurens, François; Berri, Mustapha; Caballero-Posadas, Ignacio; Attucci, Sylvie",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0168577; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27992534/,259

The use of disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), including biologics and targeted synthetic DMARDs, has aroused particular interest because of both their immunosuppressive effects and their hypothetical potential in COVID-19 treatment. AREAS COVERED For this narrative review a literature search was conducted between December 2019 and February 2021 on PubMed including epidemiological studies, gathering the main evidence available to date about the impact of COVID-19 on RA patients and the influence of anti-rheumatic drugs on patients' susceptibility to this infection. We also summarize the recommendations from the international guidelines on management of rheumatic diseases and treatments in this pandemic context, especially focused on RA. EXPERT OPINION About a year after the outbreak of the pandemic we are able to answer some of the most relevant questions regarding patients with RA and their management in this pandemic context.

Histological examination revealed a bronchial carcinoid with positive staining for GHRH. Somatostatin analogs (SAs) can play an important role in the treatment of neuroendocrine tumors, dependent on the somatostatin receptor subtype (sst) expression pattern. The sst pattern in bronchial carcinoids and effects of SAs have not been extensively investigated, particularly not for the recently developed universal SA SOM230 (Pasireotide) that has high affinity for sst1, 2, 3, and 5. OBJECTIVE Our objective was to investigate the in vivo response of a GHRH-producing bronchial carcinoid to octreotide (OCT), its sst-expression profile, and in vitro responses to different SAs, including SOM230. METHODS In vivo, 50 microg OCT was administered, and plasma GH and GHRH responses were determined. In vitro, the expression of ssts was analyzed by quantitative PCR. Furthermore, the effects of SOM230 and OCT on GHRH secretion were evaluated in primary cell cultures of the carcinoid tissue. RESULTS In vivo, OCT administration fully suppressed GH and GHRH levels. In vitro, sst1 mRNA was most abundant, followed by sst2 and sst5. Both SOM230 and OCT inhibited GHRH production dose dependently (SOM230 100 nm vs. control, P = 0.01; OCT 110 nm vs. control, P = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS In this case of a GHRH-producing bronchial carcinoid, we demonstrated that SOM230 was a potent inhibitor of GHRH production in vitro and was at least equally potent compared with OCT. Therefore, SOM230 may be a potential therapeutic agent to control GHRH secretion in ectopic acromegaly.","van Hoek, M; Hofland, L J; de Rijke, Y B; van Nederveen, F H; de Krijger, R R; van Koetsveld, P M; Lamberts, S W J; van der Lely, A J; de Herder, W W; Feelders, R A",The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,https://doi.org/10.1210/jc.2008-1712; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19017754/,259

During the 6-week, double-blind adjunctive phase, response was defined as at least 50% reduction in the MADRS score and remission as at least 50% reduction in MADRS score and a MADRS score ≤ 10. Rates were examined using analysis of covariance and Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel tests. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to calculate time to response and remission. Of 1038 patients, 72% (n=746) exhibited a minimal response to ADT (ADT minimal responder). Time to response and remission were significantly shorter for ADT minimal responders receiving aripiprazole+ADT versus adjunctive placebo+ADT. ADT minimal responders on aripiprazole+ADT showed significantly greater improvements in MADRS score at endpoint compared with minimal responders on placebo+ADT (-10.3 vs. -6.5, P<0.0001). In addition, ADT minimal responders exhibited significantly higher response rates with aripiprazole+ADT than placebo+ADT (36 vs. 19%, respectively, P<0.0001) and higher remission rates (24 vs. 12%, respectively, P<0.0001). The numbers needed to treat with aripiprazole+ADT were six for response and eight for remission.

METHODS We examined device utilization in 2,968 CTO PCIs performed in 2,936 patients at 19 US and two international center between January 2016 and January 2019. RESULTS The median number of antegrade guidewires used per case declined (5 in 2016 vs 3 in 2019) and was higher in higher complexity lesions (2 in J-CTO 0 vs. 8 in J-CTO 4 or 5 score). In antegrade-only procedures, the most frequently used guidewires were the Pilot 200 (Abbott Vascular, 37%), Fielder XT (Asahi Intecc, 25%) and Gaia third (Asahi Intecc, 18%), while the most commonly used microcatheters were the Turnpike Spiral (Vascular Solutions, 18%) and Turnpike (Vascular Solutions, 16%). Compared with 2012-2015, during 2016-2019 use of novel equipment such as the Gaia guidewires and the Turnpike microcatheters led to decreased use of Confianza Pro 12 (Asahi Intecc) wire and Corsair (Asahi Intecc) family of microcatheters. In retrograde cases, the guidewires most commonly used were the Sion (44%), Pilot 200 (27%) and Fielder FC (26%), while the Corsair/Corsair Pro, Turnpike LP (Vascular Solutions) and Caravel (Asahi Intecc) were the most frequently used microcatheters for collateral crossing (29%, 26% and 22%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS The most commonly used guidewires during CTO PCI are polymer-jacketed guidewires and the most commonly used microcatheters are torquable microcatheters.","Nikolakopoulos, Ilias; Choi, James W; Alaswad, Khaldoon; Khatri, Jaikirshan J; Krestyaninov, Oleg; Khelimskii, Dmitrii; Yeh, Robert W; Jaffer, Farouc A; Toma, Catalin; Patel, Mitul; Mahmud, Ehtisham; Lembo, Nicholas J; Parikh, Manish; Kirtane, Ajay J; Ali, Ziad A; Gkargkoulas, Fotis; Uretsky, Barry; Sheikh, Abdul M; Vemmou, Evangelia; Xenogiannis, Iosif; Rangan, Bavana V; Garcia, Santiago; Abdullah, Shuaib; Banerjee, Subhash; Burke, M Nicholas; Brilakis, Emmanouil S; Karmpaliotis, Dimitri",Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,https://doi.org/10.1002/ccd.29106; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32597031/,259

92349,Are Lifestyle Interventions to Reduce Excessive Gestational Weight Gain Cost Effective? A Systematic Review.,2020-02-01,"PURPOSE In clinical practice, conversion from universal cytomegalovirus prophylaxis (CMV PPX) with valganciclovir (VGC) to targeted therapy (preemptive monitoring, PEM) is often pursued in the setting of leukopenia. It is unknown if this is an effective strategy. METHODS Adult patients receiving a kidney and/or pancreas transplant were included if converted from PPX to PEM between 9/1/19-3/1/20 due to leukopenia. A positive CMV viral load (VL) was defined as CMV PCR greater than the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) based on local lab testing. A CMV VL of >500 IU/mL was chosen as the preemptive treatment (PET) threshold. Primary objective was to describe the impact of conversion on resolution of leukopenia. Secondary objectives were to assess PEM associated outcomes. RESULTS There were 49 patients converted from PPX to PEM due to leukopenia in the study period; 88% were KTRs and 96% received lymphocyte-depleting induction. 84% were seropositive at transplant (R+) and 16% were high-risk (D+/R-). Mean WBC at time of enrollment was 1.4±0.4. After PEM conversion, WBC recovered to >3 in 87.8% of the population in a mean of 26.8±24.5 days. Immunosuppression was modified in 96% of the population and GCSF was required in 46.9% of patients. CMV viremia occurred in 36.7% of the population; 78% were KTRs and 94% were R+. Time from PEM enrollment to PET was 64±34 days. Median VL at first detection was 587 IU/mL, median peak was 1,920 IU/mL. Five patients (27.8%) presented with symptoms consistent with CMV syndrome, none had end organ disease. Six patients (33%) presented with a VL <500 IU/mL at first detection, but all subsequently surpassed the threshold and required PET. Mean duration of PET was 25±11 days. Mean change in WBC in response to PET was -0.4±1.3. Immunosuppression required further adjustment in 61% of patients. There were no deaths or graft loss due to CMV at last follow up. CONCLUSION In kidney and pancreas transplant recipients who undergo PEM conversion due to leukopenia, withholding of VGC can improve leukopenia, but other concomitant measures are necessary. This population should be considered fairly high risk, with a threshold of treatment of first quantifiable replication. Our findings suggest lack of harm from this approach, but highlight the importance of close monitoring to prevent symptomatic replication. Larger studies with longer follow up are needed to better evaluate the impact of PEM conversion on late-onset CMV and patient and graft outcomes.","Jorgenson, Margaret R; Wong, Cynthia; Descourouez, Jillian L; Saddler, Christopher M; Smith, Jeannina A; Mandelbrot, Didier A",Transplant infectious disease : an official journal of the Transplantation Society,https://doi.org/10.1111/tid.13617; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33866643/,259

96921,Do health information technology self-management interventions improve glycemic control in medically underserved adults with diabetes? A systematic review and meta-analysis.,2017,"Harvesting of autografts results in donor site morbidities and is limited in scenarios such as large total body surface area burns. In these instances, coverage is increased by meshing grafts at the expense of delayed biologic closure. Moreover, graft meshing increases the likelihood of contraction and hypertrophic scarring, limits range of motion, and worsens cosmesis. Many tissue engineering technologies have touted the promise of adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) for burn wounds. The primary objective of the current study was to determine feasibility and efficacy of in situ ASC delivery via PEGylated fibrin (FPEG) hydrogels as adjuncts to meshed split thickness skin grafts in a porcine model. Deep partial thickness burns were created on the dorsum of anesthetized Yorkshire pigs, and subsequently debrided on post-burn day 4. After debridement, wounds were treated with: split thickness skin grafts (STSG); meshed STSG (mSTSG); and mSTSG + FPEG with increasing doses of ASCs. We show that FPEG hydrogels can be delivered in situ to prevent the contraction seen after meshing of STSG. Moreover, ASCs delivered in FPEG dose-dependently increase blood vessel size which significantly correlates with CD31 protein levels. The current study reports a dual-action adjunct therapy to autografting administered in situ, wherein FPEG acts as both scaffolding to prevent contraction, and as a delivery vehicle for ASCs to accelerate angiogenesis. This strategy may be used to incorporate other biologics for generating tissue engineered products aimed at improving wound healing and minimizing donor sites or scarring.

98187,Health Care for Our Nation's Veterans: A Policy Paper From the American College of Physicians.,2021-10-05,"Well before COVID-19, there was growing excitement about the potential of various digital technologies such as tele-health, smartphone apps, or AI chatbots to revolutionize mental healthcare. As the SARS-CoV-2 virus spread across the globe, clinicians warned of the mental illness epidemic within the coronavirus pandemic. Now, funding for digital mental health technologies is surging and many researchers are calling for widespread adoption to address the mental health sequelae of COVID-19. Reckoning with the ethical implications of these technologies is urgent because decisions made today will shape the future of mental health research and care for the foreseeable future. We contend that the most pressing ethical issues concern (1) the extent to which these technologies demonstrably improve mental health outcomes and (2) the likelihood that wide-scale adoption will exacerbate the existing health inequalities laid bare by the pandemic. We argue that the evidence for efficacy is weak and that the likelihood of increasing inequalities is high. First, we review recent trends in digital mental health. Next, we turn to the clinical literature to show that many technologies proposed as a response to COVID-19 are unlikely to improve outcomes. Then, we argue that even evidence-based technologies run the risk of increasing health disparities. We conclude by suggesting that policymakers should not allocate limited resources to the development of many digital mental health tools and should focus instead on evidence-based solutions to address mental health inequalities.","Skorburg, Joshua August; Yam, Josephine",AJOB neuroscience,https://doi.org/10.1080/21507740.2021.1918284; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33989127/,259

Expanding federal problem-solving courts will better serve individuals with mental illness and substance use disorders in the federal criminal justice system and allow them to benefit from rehabilitation and diversion programs.

METHODS We identified centres recording ≥10 consecutive patients in the SITS-ISTR with at least 70% of available modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at 3 months during 2014-2019. We defined large artery occlusion as intracranial internal carotid artery, first and second segment of middle cerebral artery and first segment of anterior cerebral artery. Outcome measures were functional independence (mRS score 0-2) and death at 3 months and symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage (SICH) per modified SITS-MOST. RESULTS Results are presented in the following order: SITS-ISTR, RCTs, MR CLEAN Registry and German Stroke Registry (GSR).

Known risk factors for negative outcomes after COVID-19, such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, disproportionally affect people with SCI and raise concerns for the mortality risk among persons with SCI. A rapid systematic review of English, Spanish, Portuguese, and Chinese literature on COVID-19 and SCI was performed using the keywords ""spinal cord injury"" and ""COVID-19."" We included studies that provided information on clinical presentation, characteristics, course, and outcomes of COVID-19 disease in SCI. We excluded studies on patients who did not have an SCI before severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection or did not report clinical information. We included 10 studies in total: nine studies with a total of 171 patients and a survey study of 783 healthcare professionals. Fever (74%), cough (52%), and dyspnea (33%) were the most frequently reported symptoms, and 63% showed abnormalities on X-ray imaging. In the included case series and reports (N = 31), only 1 patient required mechanical ventilation, but 3 patients died (10%). The mortality rate in a large registry study (N = 140) was 19%. Clinical presentation of COVID-19 in SCI patients was similar to the general population, and though adverse events and intensive care unit admission were low, the mortality rate was high (10-19%).

Within the context of rising social media utilization and recent declines in exclusive breastfeeding practices in Ghana, we implemented Breastfeed4Ghana, a Facebook- and Twitter-based breastfeeding social media campaign. This study determined feasibility of implementing Breastfeed4Ghana and evaluated its impact on breastfeeding knowledge in Ghana. Key performance indicators of the campaign were monitored on social media platforms, Facebook and Twitter. An online cross-sectional survey conducted across three time points (n = 451) assessed breastfeeding knowledge, campaign exposure, and understanding and acceptability of Breastfeed4Ghana among Ghanaian adults. Modified Poisson models were used to assess the relationship between campaign exposure and breastfeeding knowledge, adjusting for survey time point, sex, and parenthood status. The campaign acquired 4,832 followers. Based on follower demographics collected from Facebook and Twitter analytics, the target population was successfully reached. Campaign exposure among survey participants was 42.3% and 48.7% at midline and endline, respectively. Campaign acceptability was high (>90%), and >44% of those exposed to the campaign also shared the campaign with others. However, 61.0% of those exposed did not know or could not remember the purpose of the campaign. Campaign exposure was not associated with higher breastfeeding knowledge (APR [95% confidence interval] = 0.96 [0.73, 1.26]). Breastfeed4Ghana was highly feasible. However, campaign understanding yielded mixed findings and may explain the limited impact on breastfeeding knowledge.","Harding, Kassandra; Aryeetey, Richmond; Carroll, Grace; Lasisi, Opeyemi; Pérez-Escamilla, Rafael; Young, Marissa",Maternal & child nutrition,https://doi.org/10.1111/mcn.12909; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31867865/,259

Decisional aids (DAs) are tools frequently used in SDM for improving knowledge sharing and facilitating the decision process. The use and outcomes of decisional aids in surgery, however, have not been investigated. This study investigates whether SDM in surgery benefits any type of surgical patient compared with non-SDM treatment using patient-defined outcomes, such as an increase in knowledge and decisional satisfaction, as well as decreased decisional regret and anxiety. METHODS The search strategy was developed with a medical librarian to address the question of whether SDM in surgery benefits any type of surgical patient compared with non-SDM treatment using patient-defined outcomes. Seven databases (Medline [Ovid], Embase [Ovid], Cochrane [Wiley], Africa-Wide [EBSCO], Global Health [Ovid], Global Index Medicus (WHO), Web of Science [Clarivate Analytics]) were searched from inception until September 9th, 2019, with no language restriction. A two-person title and abstract screen was performed, followed by a full-text publication review. A DerSimonian-Laird random effects model was used for the meta-analysis, with heterogeneity established. Mean and standard deviation were collected for all study outcomes. Study eligibility was determined with strict inclusion and exclusion criteria. Study quality was assessed using the Cochrane Bias Risk Assessment Tool. RESULTS In total, 6060 studies were retrieved. After duplicates were removed, 5303 titles and abstracts were screened, and of 356 full texts reviewed, 42 studies were included in the analysis. Heterogeneity was high in three of six variables (surgery chosen, decisional conflict, and knowledge gained), moderate in two (decisional anxiety and decisional satisfaction), and low in one (decisional regret). For all except the rates of surgical intervention, the results for decisional conflict, knowledge gained, decisional satisfaction, and decisional anxiety were significant at a 95% confidence interval. Decisional conflict decreased in 20/24 of the papers that recorded it; rates of choosing surgery decreased in 8 of the 11; and patient knowledge increased in 19 of the 22 that recorded it. The majority of papers had risk of bias, however, with the evidence of generally low quality. CONCLUSION The results suggest that SDM in surgery is associated with greater quality of patient satisfaction and value agreement, leading to decreased conflict and anxiety, and increased knowledge and translation. This data is useful in guiding the development of SDM protocols for use in surgical disciplines.

In order to reduce these complications, the staple line can be reinforced by absorbable sutures or by the use of glycolide trimethylene carbonate copolymer onto the linear stapler (Gore Seamguard; W.L. Gore & Associates, Inc, Flagstaff, AZ). To our knowledge, there are no randomized studies showing the utility of staple line reinforcement during LSG. The purpose of this study was to randomly compare three techniques in LSG: no staple line reinforcement (group 1), buttressing of the staple line with Gore Seamguard (group 2), and staple line suturing (group 3). METHODS Between January 2008 and February 2009, 75 patients were prospectively and randomly enrolled in the three different techniques of handling the staple line during LSG.

Mean number of stapler cartridges used was 5.6 +/- 0.7 (group 1), 5.7 +/- 0.7 (group 2), and 5.8 +/- 0.6 (group 3) (NS). Postoperative leak affected one patient (group 1), two patients (group 2), and one patient (group 3) (NS). Mean hospital stay was 3.6 +/- 1.4 days (group 1), 3.9 +/- 1.5 days (group 2), and 2.8 +/- 0.8 days (group 3) (p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS In LSG, buttressing the staple line with Gore Seamguard statistically reduces blood loss during stomach sectioning as well as overall blood loss. No staple line reinforcement statistically decreases the time to perform stomach sectioning and the total operative time. No significant difference is evidenced in terms of postoperative leak between the three techniques of LSG.","Dapri, Giovanni; Cadière, Guy Bernard; Himpens, Jacques",Obesity surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-009-0047-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20012507/,259
102699,Prevalence and impact of diabetes in patients with COVID-19 in China.,2020-10-15,"INTRODUCTION There are concerns that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) may worsen outcomes in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This systemic review and meta-analysis aimed to study in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients who were on ACEI/ARB as compared to those not on ACEI/ARB. METHODS We search PubMed, EMBASE, clinicaltrials.gov and Google Scholar between 1 January 2020 and 30 May 2020 to identify all studies that evaluated the use of ACEI/ARB and reported the in-hospital mortality outcomes in COVID-19 patients. Nine non-randomised studies were eligible for inclusion in the analysis. The primary outcome studied was in-hospital mortality of COVID-19 patients who were on ACEI/ARB compared with those not on ACEI/ARB. RESULTS Of the 8,313 patients in the nine studies, 7,622 (91.7%) were from studies with all-comers, while 691 (8.3%) were from studies with only hypertensive patients. 577 (14.6%) in-hospital deaths were observed out of a total of 3,949 patients with an outcome in the nine studies. Overall, there was no significant difference in in-hospital mortality between patients on ACEI/ARB and those not on ACEI/ARB (odds radio [OR] 1.06, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.75-1.50; p = 0.73). Further sensitivity analysis in the hypertensive group and all-comers group showed similar results (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.58-1.32; p = 0.53 and OR 1.85, 95% CI 1.00-3.43; p = 0.05, respectively). CONCLUSION This study found that ACEI/ARB has no significant impact on in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients and can be used safely in patients with indications.","Cai, Xinzhe James; Tay, Julian Cheong Kiat; Kui, Swee Leng; Tin, Aung Soe; Tan, Vern Hsen",Singapore medical journal,https://doi.org/10.11622/smedj.2020159; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33256355/,259

A total of 144 visits were scheduled between 6th March and 6th April 2020. These mostly consisted of neurological or psychological visits (139, 96.5%). One hundred thirty-nine (96.5%) visits were performed as telemedicine and mostly via phone call (112, 80.6%). Three (2.1%) visits were considered as urgent and maintained as outpatient care. Additionally, patients were still able to telephone, being put through directly to their neurologists. Many requests of contact were addressed at getting information about the scheduled visits or examinations (45, 43.3%). Globally, patients and caregivers were satisfied with the telemedicine service. However, the majority (85, 65.9%) would prefer a face-to-face visit. In conclusion, telemedicine could be considered a good complement to face-to-face care, even after social restrictions have been eased.","Vasta, Rosario; Moglia, Cristina; D'Ovidio, Fabrizio; Di Pede, Francesca; De Mattei, Filippo; Cabras, Sara; Peotta, Laura; Iazzolino, Barbara; Giusiano, Silvia; Manera, Umberto; Palumbo, Francesca; Bombaci, Alessandro; Torrieri, Maria Claudia; Ilardi, Antonio; Mastro, Enza; Arcari, Martina; Solero, Luca; Grassano, Maurizio; Daviddi, Margherita; Matteoni, Enrico; Salamone, Paolina; Fuda, Giuseppe; Canosa, Antonio; Chiò, Adriano; Calvo, Andrea",Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis & frontotemporal degeneration,https://doi.org/10.1080/21678421.2020.1820043; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32924624/,259

Reliability might be improved by matrix radiofrequency ablation (MRFA), in which the whole tumour volume is contained within a cage of x × y parallel electrodes. The aim of this study was to optimise the smallest building block for matrix radiofrequency ablation: a recently developed bipolar 2 × 2 electrode system. MATERIALS AND METHODS In ex vivo bovine liver, the parameters of the experimental set-up were changed one by one. In a second step, a finite element method (FEM) modelling of the experiment was performed to better understand the experimental findings. RESULTS The optimal power to obtain complete ablation in the shortest time was 50-60 W. Performing an ablation until impedance rise was superior to ablation for a fixed duration. Increasing electrode diameter improved completeness of ablation due to lower temperature along the electrodes. A chessboard pattern of electrode polarity was inferior to a row pattern due to an electric field void in between the electrodes. Variability of ablation size was limited. The FEM correctly simulated and explained the findings in ex vivo liver. CONCLUSIONS These experiments and FEM modelling allowed a better insight in the factors influencing the ablation zone in a bipolar 2 × 2 electrode RF system. With optimal parameters, complete ablation was obtained quickly and with limited variability. This knowledge will be useful to build a larger system with x × y electrodes for MRFA.","Mulier, Stefaan; Jiang, Yansheng; Jamart, Jacques; Wang, Chong; Feng, Yuanbo; Marchal, Guy; Michel, Luc; Ni, Yicheng","International journal of hyperthermia : the official journal of European Society for Hyperthermic Oncology, North American Hyperthermia Group",https://doi.org/10.3109/02656736.2015.1046194; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26156212/,259

An argument against redirection.,2020-09-01,"Validation of key analytical and functional performance characteristics of in vitro immunogenicity risk assessment assays increases our confidence in utilizing them for screening biotherapeutics. Herein, we present a fit-for-purpose (FFP) validation of a dendritic cell (DC) activation assay designed to assess the immunogenicity liability of protein biotherapeutics. Characterization of key assay parameters was achieved using monocyte-derived DCs (MoDCs) treated with cell culture medium only (i.e., background control (BC)), keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) as system positive control (SPC), and 2 therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with known clinical immunogenicity profiles (bococizumab and TAM163) as therapeutic controls (TCs). In the absence of established validation guidelines for primary cell-based assays, the present DC activation assay was validated using a novel FFP approach which allows more flexibility in selection of validation parameters and designing of experiments based on the intended use of the assay. The present FFP validation allowed us to understand the impact of experimental variables on assay precision, develop a clear concise readout for DC activation results, establish a reliable response threshold to define a result as a positive DC activation response, and define in-study donor acceptance criteria and cohort size. FFP validation of this DC activation assay indicated that the assay is sufficient to support its context of use, a preclinical immunogenicity risk management tool.","Wickramarachchi, Dilki; Steeno, Gregory; You, Zhiping; Shaik, Saleem; Lepsy, Christopher; Xue, Li",The AAPS journal,https://doi.org/10.1208/s12248-020-00491-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32839919/,259

A surgical excision of the rudimentary horn is the standard treatment, usually performed by laparotomy in the second trimester. Methods: A 36-year-old woman, secundigravida and nulliparous, was admitted to the emergency obstetric unit with acute pelvic pain. The ultrasound found an ectopic pregnancy at 15 weeks gestational age with fetal cardiac activity. As her hemodynamic status was stable, a diagnostic laparoscopy was performed and confirmed the development of the pregnancy in a left rudimentary uterine horn. Results: We report a total laparoscopic removal of a pre-ruptured rudimentary uterine horn containing a second trimester ectopic pregnancy, using a vessel-sealer device. To our knowledge, only three other cases of successful laparoscopic treatment of second trimester rudimentary horn pregnancies have been reported in the literature. Conclusion: Laparoscopy is an efficient and safe surgical option for treating rudimentary horn second trimester pregnancy in patients with hemodynamic stability.","Chatziioannidou, Kyriaki; Fehlmann, Aurore; Dubuisson, Jean",Frontiers in surgery,https://doi.org/10.3389/fsurg.2020.582954; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33240926/,259

106926,COVID-19 Infection: Implications for Perioperative and Critical Care Physicians: Erratum.,2020-06-24,"INTRODUCTION The growing prevalence of diabetes has increased the need for scalable technologies to improve outcomes. My Diabetes My Way (MDMW) is an electronic personal health record (ePHR) available to all people with diabetes in Scotland since 2010, associated with improved clinical outcomes among users. MDMW pulls data from a national clinician-facing informatics platform and provides self-management and educational information. This study aims to describe MDMW user demographics through time with respect to the national diabetes population, with a view to addressing potential health inequalities. METHODS Aggregate data were obtained retrospectively from the MDMW database and annual Scottish Diabetes Survey (SDS) from 2010 to 2020. Variables included diabetes type, sex, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, and glycemic control. Prevalence of MDMW uptake was calculated using corresponding SDS data as denominators. Comparisons between years and demographic sub-groups were made using Chi- Squared tests. RESULTS Overall uptake of MDMW has steadily increased since implementation. By 2020, of all people with T1D or T2D in Scotland, 13% were fully enrolled to MDMW (39,881/312,326). There was proportionately greater numbers of users in younger, more affluent demographic groups (with a clear social gradient) with better glycemic control. As uptake has increased through time, so too has the observed gaps between different demographic sub-groups. CONCLUSIONS The large number of MDMW users is encouraging, but remains a minority of people with diabetes in Scotland. There is a risk that innovations like MDMW can widen health inequalities and it is incumbent upon healthcare providers to identify strategies to prevent this.","Conway, Nicholas T; Bluett, Michael; Shields, Cathy; Taylor, Andrew; Wake, Deborah J; Cunningham, Scott G",Journal of diabetes science and technology,https://doi.org/10.1177/19322968211005734; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33870755/,259

A total of 338 NOA patients with 344 consecutive cycles received treatment in the reproductive medicine center of Peking University Third Hospital in Beijing, China, from January 2014 to December 2017. Fresh oocytes and fresh sperm were used in 222 patients with 234 cycles (Group A). Fresh oocytes and cryopreserved sperm were used in 116 patients with 110 cycles (Group B). We compared patient characteristics, embryonic development, and pregnancy outcomes between Groups A and B. There was no statistical difference in the patient characteristics, and no differences were observed with fertilization or quality embryo rates between Groups A and B. The rates of clinical pregnancy and live birth were both higher for Group A than those for Group B (both P < 0.05).

Nonetheless, the significance and physiopathology of oral manifestations have not been clearly established in the clinical progression or outcome of the infection. AIM To describe the clinico-pathological oral mucosal lesions in four patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS AND RESULTS Four patients with COVID-19 disease and confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) presented angina bullosa hemorragica-like lesion, vascular disorder, and nonspecific stomatitis, one patient with histological analysis demonstrated perivascular reactive lymphocitic infliltrate, focal capillary thrombosis, and hemorrhage. According to the discrimination of other local and systemic conditions and the synchronous onset of oral and systemic symptoms, the diagnosis of oral lesions probably associated with COVID-19 was established. CONCLUSION Infection with SARS-CoV-2 may result in oral manifestations with various clinical presentations, which presumably support the hypothesis of thrombi formation and vasculitis; nevertheless, these findings need more evidence and a long-term follow up of patients to accurately establish the significance of the oral mucosa affection in the COVID-19 disease.","Cruz Tapia, Roberto Onner; Peraza Labrador, Alberto Jose; Guimaraes, Douglas Magno; Matos Valdez, Luciano Hermios","Special care in dentistry : official publication of the American Association of Hospital Dentists, the Academy of Dentistry for the Handicapped, and the American Society for Geriatric Dentistry",https://doi.org/10.1111/scd.12520; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32882068/,259

The present study aimed to examine the ability of four pretreatment acoustic markers to predict the alliance that is likely to be formed in the course of treatment: F0-span, speech rate, pause proportion, and jitter. Data from 560 observations of 38 patients were collected as part of an ongoing randomized clinical trial of short-term psychotherapy for major depressive disorder. The acoustic markers were measured using high-quality recordings at baseline, before the patient and therapist ever met or had any type of communication. A multilevel model was used to examine the ability of the four acoustic markers to predict the slopes of alliance formation in the course of treatment, all markers being introduced in the same model. The clinical utility of the acoustic markers was explored in two case studies. The model explained 22% of the variance in alliance formation. Higher levels of both jitter and pause proportion at baseline predicted less strengthening of the alliance in the course of treatment. The findings, which should be replicated in larger samples, suggest that much of the therapeutic alliance can be predicted based on the acoustic characteristics of the patient's voice in the first 3 minutes of their intake, before they even meet their therapist.","Nof, Aviv; Amir, Ofer; Goldstein, Pavel; Zilcha Mano, Sigal",Clinical psychology & psychotherapy,https://doi.org/10.1002/cpp.2534; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33270316/,259

The authors investigated the association between early discontinuation of ET and social determinants of health, including insurance coverage and the neighborhood deprivation index (NDI), which was measured on the basis of patients' zip codes, in breast cancer. METHODS In this retrospective analysis of a prospective randomized clinical trial (Trial Assigning Individualized Options for Treatment), women with hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative breast cancer who started ET within a year of study entry were included. Early discontinuation was calculated as stopping ET within 4 years of its start for reasons other than distant recurrence or death via Kaplan-Meier estimates. A Cox proportional hazards joint model was used to analyze the association between early discontinuation of ET and factors such as the study-entry insurance and NDI, with adjustments made for other variables. RESULTS Of the included 9475 women (mean age, 55.6 years; White race, 84%), 58.0% had private insurance, whereas 11.7% had Medicare, 5.8% had Medicaid, 3.8% were self-pay, and 19.1% were treated at international sites. The early discontinuation rate was 12.3%. Compared with those with private insurance, patients with Medicaid (hazard ratio [HR], 1.53; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.23-1.92) and self-pay patients (HR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.25-2.17) had higher early discontinuation. Participants with a first-quartile NDI (highest deprivation) had a higher probability of discontinuation than those with a fourth-quartile NDI (lowest deprivation; HR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.11-1.62). CONCLUSIONS Patients' insurance and zip code at study entry play roles in adherence to ET, with uninsured and underinsured patients having a high rate of treatment nonadherence. Early identification of patients at risk may improve adherence to therapy. LAY SUMMARY In this retrospective analysis of 9475 women with breast cancer participating in a clinical trial (Trial Assigning Individualized Options for Treatment), Medicaid and self-pay patients (compared with those with private insurance) and those in the highest quartile of neighborhood deprivation scores (compared with those in the lowest quartile) had a higher probability of early discontinuation of endocrine therapy. These social determinants of health assume larger importance with the expected increase in unemployment rates and loss of insurance coverage in the aftermath of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Early identification of patients at risk and enrollment in insurance optimization programs may improve the persistence of therapy.","Sadigh, Gelareh; Gray, Robert J; Sparano, Joseph A; Yanez, Betina; Garcia, Sofia F; Timsina, Lava R; Sledge, George W; Cella, David; Wagner, Lynne I; Carlos, Ruth C",Cancer,https://doi.org/10.1002/cncr.33527; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33793979/,259

METHODS Between March and June 2020, all appointments at the practice of a single Andrology-focused academic urologist were conducted by telephone. Consecutive patients were contacted by telephone following their appointment to complete a telephone questionnaire. Baseline demographic information was obtained, and perceptions regarding telephone appointments were assessed using a Likert scale. RESULTS Ninety-six patients completed the telephone questionnaire. Median age was 58.5 years (interquartile range [IQR] 37.3-62.8 years) with 55/96 (57.3%) of the appointments Andrology-focused. Mean distance of residence from the hospital was 8.4 km (IQR 4.7-25.2 km). Only 9/96 (9.3%) of the patients felt that the telephone format did not adequately address their needs. However, 26/96 (27.1%) of patients said they would prefer an in-person appointment. On multivariable analysis adjusting for age, gender, presenting complaint, type of appointment, education level, and employment status, no factors were associated with feeling that the telephone appointment adequately addressed needs or preference for an in-person appointment in the future.

115939,Crowdsourcing Health Policy with the Provider Community during a Crisis.,2021-01-01,"OBJECTIVES The problem of defining burnout concerns its overlapping effect with other syndromes and disorders, such as depression and anxiety. Additionally, some individual characteristics influence susceptibility to burnout (e.g., neuroticism). Therefore, the question arises whether burnout is or is not a distinct syndrome. The aim of the study is to compare 2 distinct burnout measures by analyzing their connections with organizational and individual variables. MATERIAL AND METHODS The study was conducted in the Institute of Applied Psychology at the Jagiellonian University, Kraków, Poland on a group of employees (N = 100; 40 men; mean age 36.03 years). All participants completed 2 burnout scales: the Maslach Burnout Inventory - General Survey (MBI-GS) and the Link Burnout Questionnaire (LBQ). Organizational and individual factors were controlled with Areas of Worklife Survey, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, NEO Five-Factor Inventory and Beck's Depression Inventory scales. A structural equation path model was created to quantify the relations between organizational factors and burnout, as well as to control the individual factors of anxiety, neuroticism and depression. RESULTS The results indicate high compatibility between MBI-GS and LBQ on burnout diagnosis. The MBI-GS and LBQ revealed stronger connections with organizational context and individual characteristics, respectively. Depression explains dimensions of exhaustion (MBI-GS, LBQ), sense of disillusion (LBQ), neuroticism-exhaustion (MBI-GS); anxiety explains sense of professional inefficacy (LBQ). CONCLUSIONS Besides organizational variables, individual characteristics also play an important role in explaining burnout syndrome. Exploring the 2 burnout models has revealed that depression is an important determinant of exhaustion. Cynicism and relationship deterioration have consistently been explained only by organizational context.

117192,Engaging older adults in self-management talk in healthcare encounters: a systematic review protocol.,2020-01-16,"Most opposition to induced abortion turns on the belief that human fetuses are persons from conception. On this view, the moral status of the fetus alone requires those in a position to provide aid-gestational mothers-to make tremendous sacrifices to benefit the fetus. Recently, critics have argued that this pro-life position requires more than opposition to induced abortion. Pro-life theorists are relatively silent on the issues of spontaneous abortion, surplus in vitro fertilisation human embryos, and the suffering and death of born persons due to lack of access to food, shelter and medical care. Colgrove et al call such arguments inconsistency arguments, arguing they 'do not matter' and mischaracterise them as ad hominem attacks. Here, I argue these are better understood as moral dilemmas. While some critics argue pro-life inaction is evidence that they do not really believe human fetuses are persons, I contend this inaction is likely the result of resolvable confusion rather than moral negligence.","Simkulet, William",Journal of medical ethics,https://doi.org/10.1136/medethics-2020-107207; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34016648/,259
117912,Association between cannabis use and treatment outcomes in patients receiving methadone maintenance treatment: a systematic review protocol.,2016,"PURPOSE Stent-assisted coiling (SAC) is increasingly used to treat complex unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIA) including wide-necked and fusiform IA. However, few data are available over the long-term results of this technique. We report our 9-year-experience of SAC of UIA. METHODS A retrospective review of our prospectively maintained database identified all patients treated by SAC for an UIA in 2 institutions. The clinical charts, procedural data and angiographic results were reviewed. RESULTS Between 2004 and 2012, we identified 164 patients with 183 UIA. There were 115 women and 49 men with a mean age of 46 years. Embolization was successful in all patients. Procedural morbidity and mortality rates were 2.2% and 0% respectively. Immediate anatomical outcome included 54 complete occlusion (29.5%), 43 neck remnants (23.5%) and 86 incomplete occlusions (47%). Imaging follow-up was available in 137 patients (mean=26 months, range 3 to 99 months) and it showed 104 complete occlusions (75.9%), 23 neck remnants (16.8%) and 10 incomplete occlusions (7.3%). At follow-up, only 3 patients developed a significant intrastent stenosis, one of which was induced by radiosurgery. One of these patients had a symptomatic thrombo-embolic complication 3 years after stent placement. CONCLUSION SAC of complex UIA is effective and associated with low complication rates. Even if immediate anatomical results are relatively unsatisfying, mid- and long-term follow-up show a major improvement with a high rate of adequate occlusion that is stable over time. Moreover, the long-term clinical and angiographic tolerance of intracranial stents is excellent.","Mine, Benjamin; Aljishi, Ali; D'Harcour, Jean-Bernard; Brisbois, Denis; Collignon, Laurent; Lubicz, Boris",Journal of neuroradiology.

118240,Age and Gender as Factors of Pressure Sensitivity of Pain-Free Persons: Are They Meaningful?,2020,"BACKGROUND: Impaired cerebral autoregulation and cerebral hypoperfusion may play a critical role in the high morbidity and mortality in patients with sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE). Bedside assessment of cerebral autoregulation may help individualize hemodynamic targets that optimize brain perfusion. We hypothesize that near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)-derived cerebral oximetry can identify blood pressure ranges that enhance autoregulation in patients with SAE and that disturbances in autoregulation are associated with severity of encephalopathy. METHODS: Adult patients with acute encephalopathy directly attributable to sepsis were followed using NIRS-based multimodal monitoring for 12 consecutive hours. We used the correlation in time between regional cerebral oxygen saturation and mean arterial pressure (MAP) to determine the cerebral oximetry index (COx) as a measure of cerebral autoregulation. Autoregulation curves were constructed for each patient with averaged COx values sorted by MAP in 3 sequential 4-hour periods; the optimal pressure (MAPOPT), defined as the MAP associated with most robust autoregulation (lowest COx), was identified in each period. Severity of encephalopathy was measured with Glasgow coma scale (GCS). RESULTS: Six patients with extracranial sepsis met the stringent criteria specified, including no pharmacological sedation or neurologic premorbidity. Optimal MAP was identified in all patients and ranged from 55 to 115 mmHg. Additionally, MAPOPT varied within individual patients over time during monitoring. Disturbed autoregulation, based on COx, was associated with worse neurologic status (GCS < 13) both with and without controlling for age and severity of sepsis (adjusted odds ratio [OR]: 2.11; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.77-2.52; P < .001; OR: 2.97; 95% CI: 1.63-5.43; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: In this high-fidelity group of patients with SAE, continuous, NIRS-based monitoring can identify blood pressure ranges that improve autoregulation. This is important given the association between cerebral autoregulatory function and severity of encephalopathy. Individualizing blood pressure goals using bedside autoregulation monitoring may better preserve cerebral perfusion in SAE than current practice.","Rosenblatt, Kathryn; Walker, Keenan A; Goodson, Carrie; Olson, Elsa; Maher, Dermot; Brown, Charles H; Nyquist, Paul",Journal of intensive care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1177/0885066619828293; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30760173/,259

Here, the authors demonstrate the safety and feasibility of band preserving-laparoscopic gastric plication (BP-LGP), which was designed to improve weight loss and decrease gastric band adjustment frequency and thereby improve patient quality of life. MATERIALS AND METHODS All 6 patients involved in this study had a gastric band in place for more than 1 year; the median interval from gastric banding to BP-LGP was 31.7 months (range, 19.7-49.9 months). Five (83.3%) patients were female. Preoperative median body mass index (BMI) at gastric banding was 35.4 kg/m(2) (range, 31.9-43.9 kg/m(2)), median nadir BMI with the gastric band was 25.7 kg/m(2) (range, 20.9-31.0 kg/m(2)), and percentage excess BMI loss (%EBMIL) ranged from 24.3% to 123.6%. Indications for BP-LGP were as follows: chronic gastric prolapse in 2 patients (33.3%), pouch-esophageal dilatation in 3 (50.0%), and insufficient weight loss in 4 (66.6%), which included 2 patients with weight loss failure (%EBMIL of <30%). RESULTS The 6 patients consecutively underwent surgery from May 2014 to January 2015. No conversion to open surgery was necessary, and no perioperative complication or mortality occurred. Mean operative time was 190 minutes. All patients showed weight loss after revision and showed resolution of troublesome signs and symptoms. Median follow-up after revision was 7.3 months (range, 5.7-10.1 months), median BMI at last follow-up was 27.6 kg/m(2) (range, 22.7-34.0 kg/m(2)), and median %EBMIL was 75.7% (range, 21.0%-103.6%). Median fill volume before revision was 6.1 mL (range, 2.7-11.0 mL), and median fill volume after revision was 0.3 mL (range, 0.0-5.3 mL). Three patients (50%) had an empty band at last follow-up. CONCLUSIONS This novel method of bariatric revision (modified BP-LGP) might have a role as a salvage procedure in patients with impending gastric band failure.","Kim, Su Bin; Kim, Seong Min",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

MATERIALS AND METHODS 518 mapping or treatment angiograms for 180 patients with primary or metastatic disease to the liver treated by Yttrium-90 radioembolization between 2/2010 and 12/2015 were retrospectively reviewed. Intra-procedural complications were recorded per SIR guidelines. Patient demographics, indication for treatment, prior exposure to chemotherapeutic agents, operator experience, and disease burden were reviewed. Technical variables including type of radioembolic (glass vs. resin microspheres), indication for angiography (mapping vs. treatment), variant anatomy, and attempts at coil embolization were also assessed. RESULTS Thirteen (13/518, 2.5%) arterial-related complications occurred in 13 patients. All but two complications resulted during transcatheter coil embolization to prevent non-target embolization. Complications included coil migration (n = 6), arterial dissection (n = 2), focal vessel perforation (n = 2), arterial thrombus (n = 2), and vasospasm prohibiting further arterial sub-selection (n = 1). Transarterial coiling was identified as a significant risk factor of complications on both univariate and multivariate regression analysis (odds ratio 7.8, P = 0.004). Usage of resin microspheres was also a significant risk factor (odds ratio 9.5, P = 0.042). No other technical parameters or pre-procedural variables were significant after adjusting for confounding on multivariate analysis (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION Intra-procedural hepatic arterial complications encountered during radioembolization were infrequent but occurred mainly during coil embolization to prevent non-target delivery to extra-hepatic arteries.","Ahmed, Osman; Patel, Mikin V; Masrani, Abdulrahman; Chong, Bradford; Osman, Mohammed; Tasse, Jordan; Soni, Jayesh; Turba, Ulku Cenk; Arslan, Bulent",Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00270-016-1555-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28078375/,259

Although exercise training is an established method to improve glycemic control, the degree to which this translates into meaningful improvements, particularly in individuals with prediabetes, is unclear. The purpose of this meta-analysis was to investigate the ability of exercise training toimprove two-hourglucose tolerance beyond the smallest worthwhile difference in individuals with prediabetes. It was hypothesized that the majority of implemented exercise programs designed for individuals with prediabetes would not result in meaningful improvements in glucose tolerance. METHODS Searches were performed in MEDLINE, The Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, SPORTDiscus, and the Cochrane Library. Included studies reported glucose tolerance using a two-hour oral glucose tolerance test at baseline and post-intervention; implemented an exercise program lasting at least 12-weeks; and included adults living with prediabetes. Mean effect summaries were determined using random-effects models. Magnitude-based inference statistic was used to estimate the likelihood that observed changes in glucose tolerance were meaningful to patients. RESULTS Nine articles were included in the meta-analysis, producing 12 independent exercise interventions. The interventions led to an average improvement in glucose tolerance of 5.9% (95% confidence interval: 3.7 - 8.0%). Seven (58%)exercise interventions were deemed likely to benefit patients, whereas five (42%) had trivial or unclear findings. CONCLUSION While exercise intervention led to statistically significant improvements in two-hourglucose tolerance, the benefit for individuals living with prediabetes remains unclear. Further research is needed to delineate optimal prescription parameters for generating meaningfulbenefits in glucose tolerance.","Hrubeniuk, Travis J; Bouchard, Danielle R; Goulet, Eric D B; Gurd, Brendon; Sénéchal, Martin",Scandinavian journal of medicine & science in sports,https://doi.org/10.1111/sms.13567; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31593613/,259

Our aim was to evaluate temporal trends in incidence, clinical features and outcomes of hospital treated acute myocarditis (AM) in Spain from 2003 to 2015. METHODS We conducted a retrospective longitudinal study using information of all hospital discharges of the Spanish National Health System. All episodes with a discharge diagnosis of AM from January 1, 2003 to December 31, 2015 were included. The risk-standardized in-hospital mortality ratio (RSMR) was calculated using a multilevel risk adjustment model developed by the Medicare and Medicaid Services. Temporal trends for in-hospital mortality were modelled using Poisson regression analysis. RESULTS A total of 11,147 episodes of AM were analysed, most of them idiopathic (94.7%). The rate of AM discharges increased along the period, from 13 to 30/million inhabitants/year (2003 to 2015), and this increase was statistically significant when weighted by age and sex (incidence rate ratio, IRR 1.06,95%CI 1.04-1.08,p=0.001). In-hospital crude mortality rate was 3.1%, diminishing significantly along 2003 to 2015 (IRR 0.95,95%CI 0.92-0.99,p=0.02). RSMR also significantly diminished along the period (IRR 0.95,95%CI 0.92-0.99,p=0.01). Renal failure (OR 7.03,5.38-9.18,p=0.001), liver disease (OR 4.61,2.59-8.21,p=0.001), pneumonia (OR 4.13,2.75-6.20,p=0.001) and heart failure (OR 1.91,95%CI 1.47-2.47,p=0.001), were the strongest independent factors associated with in-hospital mortality. CONCLUSIONS AM is an uncommon entity, although hospital discharges have increased in Spain along the study period. Most of AM were idiopathic.

A substantial proportion of men in this PSA span have prostate cancer (PCa), but biomarkers to determine who should undergo a prostate biopsy are lacking. OBJECTIVE To evaluate whether a genetic risk score identifies men in the PSA range of 1-3 ng/ml who are at higher risk for PCa. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Men aged 50-69 yr with PSA 1-3 ng/ml and without a previous prostate biopsy were selected from the STHLM2 cohort. Of 2696 men, 49 SNPs were genotyped, and a polygenic risk score was calculated. Of these men, 860 were invited according to risk score, and 172 underwent biopsy. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS The risk of PCa was assessed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS PCa was diagnosed in 47 of 172 participants (27%), with Gleason sum 6 in 36 of 47 men (77%) and Gleason sum ≥7 in 10 of 47 men (21%); one man had intraductal cancer. The genetic score was a significant predictor of a positive biopsy (p=0.028), even after adjusting for PSA, ratio of free to total PSA, prostate volume, age, and family history. There was an increase in the odds ratio of 1.60 (95% confidence interval, 1.05-2.45) with increasing genetic risk score. The absolute risk difference of positive biopsy was 19 percentage points, comparing the high and low genetic risk group (37% vs 18%). CONCLUSIONS A risk score based on SNPs predicts biopsy outcome in previously unbiopsied men with PSA 1-3 ng/ml. Introducing a genetic-based risk stratification tool can increase the proportion of men being classified in line with their true risk of PCa.","Nordström, Tobias; Aly, Markus; Eklund, Martin; Egevad, Lars; Grönberg, Henrik",European urology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eururo.2013.07.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23891454/,259

Public acceptance of the role of private companies to control life-saving drugs, as well as of the intellectual property system, informs campaigns guaranteeing universal access to medicines and corporate strategies to shape policy. This study consists of a qualitative content analysis of online comments about news reports of Gilead Science's pricing of remdesivir, a re-purposed drug that shows some positive efficacy against COVID-19 in clinical trials. Analysing elite and public framing about medicine pricing informs our understanding of the social construction of markets. The findings identify hegemonic and counter-hegemonic discourse about innovation, affordability, saving lives, health care savings and international comparisons that stimulate debate and potentially advocacy.

To explore statistical relationships between RV systolic function and age, gender, heart rate, and bodyweight. ANIMALS 80 healthy adult dogs. METHODS Dogs underwent 2 echocardiographic examinations. Repeatability and intra-observer and inter-observer measurement variability were quantified by average coefficient of variation (CV). Relationships between RV function and age, heart rate and bodyweight were estimated by regression analysis. RESULTS All indices were acquired with clinically acceptable repeatability and intra- and inter-observer variability (CVs < 10%). No differences were identified between male and female dogs. Allometric scaling by bodyweight demonstrated significant, clinically relevant correlations between RV function and bodyweight (all p ≤ 0.001) as follows: TAPSE - strong positive correlation (r(2) = 0.75); S' - moderate positive correlation (r(2) = 0.31); strain rate - moderate negative correlation (r(2) = 0.44); FAC and strain - weak negative correlations (r(2) = 0.22 and 0.14, respectively). Strain rate and FAC were positively correlated with heart rate (r(2) = 0.35 and 0.31, respectively). Allometric scaling generated bodyweight-based reference intervals for these RV systolic function indices.

In this study, we use transcriptomics and extracellular flux analyses to investigate the metabolic profiles of primary thymic and in vitro-derived mouse and human thymocytes. Core metabolic pathways, specifically glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, undergo dramatic changes between the double-negative (DN), double-positive (DP), and mature single-positive (SP) stages in murine and human thymus. Remarkably, despite the absence of the complex multicellular thymic microenvironment, in vitro murine and human T cell development recapitulated the coordinated decrease in glycolytic and oxidative phosphorylation activity between the DN and DP stages seen in primary thymus. Moreover, by inducing in vitro T cell differentiation from Rag1-/- mouse bone marrow, we show that reduced metabolic activity at the DP stage is independent of TCR rearrangement. Thus, our findings suggest that highly conserved metabolic transitions are critical for thymic T cell development.","Sun, Victoria; Sharpley, Mark; Kaczor-Urbanowicz, Karolina E; Chang, Patrick; Montel-Hagen, Amélie; Lopez, Shawn; Zampieri, Alexandre; Zhu, Yuhua; de Barros, Stéphanie C; Parekh, Chintan; Casero, David; Banerjee, Utpal; Crooks, Gay M",Frontiers in immunology,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.716661; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34394122/,259

127505,Facing Death in a Pandemic.,2020-06-16,"BACKGROUND Contact tracing can provide accurate information on relevant parameters of an ongoing emerging infectious disease outbreak. This is crucial to investigators seeking to control such an outbreak. However, crude contact tracing data are difficult to interpret and methods for analyzing these data are scarce. We present a method to estimate and visualize key outbreak parameters from contact tracing information in real time by taking into account data censoring. METHODS/RESULTS Exposure type-specific attack rates and the reproduction number R(t) are estimated from contact tracing data by using maximum likelihood estimation to account for censored data. The attack rates reflect, in the context of contact tracing, the specificity of the contact definition; a higher value indicates relatively efficient contact tracing. The evolution of R(t) over time provides information regarding the effectiveness of interventions. To allow a real-time overview of the outbreak, the attack rates and the evolution of R(t) over time are visualized together with the case-contact network and epicurve. We applied the method to a well-documented smallpox outbreak in The Netherlands to demonstrate the added value. CONCLUSION Our method facilitates the analysis of contact tracing information by quickly turning it into accessible information, helping outbreak investigators to make real-time decisions to more effectively and efficiently control infectious disease outbreaks.","Soetens, Loes; Klinkenberg, Don; Swaan, Corien; Hahné, Susan; Wallinga, Jacco",Epidemiology,https://doi.org/10.1097/ede.0000000000000776; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29087987/,259

We aim to synthesize evidence concerning the association between 30-day unplanned hospital readmission and patient-related factors, insurance status, treatment and comorbidities in adult patients with DM. We searched full-text English language articles in three electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL) without confining to a particular publication period or geographical area. Prospective and retrospective cohort and case-control studies which identified significant risk factors of 30-day unplanned hospital readmission were included, while interventional studies were excluded. The study participants were aged ≥18 years with either type 1 or 2 DM. The random effects model was used to quantify the overall effect of each factor. Twenty-three studies published between 1998 and 2018 met the selection criteria and 18 provided information for the meta-analysis. The data were collected within a period ranging from 1 to 15 years. Although patient-related factors such as age, gender and race were identified, comorbidities such as heart failure (OR=1.81, 95% CI 1.67 to 1.96) and renal disease (OR=1.69, 95% CI 1.34 to 2.12), as well as insulin therapy (OR=1.45, 95% CI 1.24 to 1.71) and insurance status (OR=1.41, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.63) were stronger predictors of 30-day unplanned hospital readmission.

We hypothesized that the microclimate around the skin is a significant risk factor for developing pressure ulcers. This research continuously assessed factors of the microclimate in terms of skin temperature and perspiration as well as the interface pressure in order to determine whether the microclimate is an independent risk factor for the development of park-bench position-related pressure ulcers (PBP-PUs). A prospective observational study was conducted among patients undergoing elective surgery in the park-bench position at a general hospital in the metropolitan area of Japan between April and November 2014. Factors of the microclimate, including skin temperature and perspiration, in addition to the interface pressure were continuously measured throughout surgery. Twenty-nine patients were analyzed (mean age 44.4 ± 13.2 years, male 44.8%). Of these 29 patients, seven (24.1%) developed Category I PBP-PUs. The change in skin temperature from baseline to the end of surgery (2.7 ± 0.3 °C vs. 1.9 ± 0.8 °C) and the average peak pressure (119.1 ± 36.8 mmHg vs. 94.5 ± 23.1 mmHg) were significantly higher in the patients with PBP-PUs than in those without PBP-PUs. There were no significant differences in the amount of perspiration between the two groups. A hierarchical logistic regression analysis showed that the change in skin temperature was significantly related to the development of PBP-PUs (unit = 0.1 °C: odds ratio 1.44, 95% confidential interval 1.09-2.33) when adjusted for the average peak pressure and length of surgery. Our results suggest that a change in skin temperature toward a higher value is an independent risk factor for the development of PBP-PUs. Proper intraoperative management of skin temperature may therefore be a promising candidate as a preventive method against PBP-PU development.","Yoshimura, Mine; Nakagami, Gojiro; Iizaka, Shinji; Yoshida, Mikako; Uehata, Yoko; Kohno, Michihiro; Kasuya, Yusuke; Mae, Tomoko; Yamasaki, Takashi; Sanada, Hiromi",Wound repair and regeneration : official publication of the Wound Healing Society [and] the European Tissue Repair Society,https://doi.org/10.1111/wrr.12340; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26171566/,259

131486,Incident user cohort study of risk for gastrointestinal bleed and stroke in individuals with major depressive disorder treated with antidepressants.,2012,"INTRODUCTION Following closed reduction and initial casting of pediatric forearm fractures, loss of reduction (LOR) occurs in ∼5% to 75% of fractures. Sugar-tong splinting has been shown to maintain acceptable reduction in pediatric distal radius fractures while potentially avoiding issues associated with circumferential casting. We hypothesized that the sugar-tong splint would be an acceptable method for initial immobilization to prevent LOR in distal, mid-shaft, and proximal pediatric forearm fractures. METHODS This is an IRB-approved, retrospective study. Inclusion criteria included pediatric patients age 4 to 16 years old, open growth plates, with a displaced forearm fracture (radius, ulna, or both bone) that underwent closed reduction. The clinical protocol involved closed reduction and application of a sugar-tong splint by an orthopaedic resident under conscious sedation in the emergency room. Clinical follow-up occurred at 1, 2, 4, and 6-week intervals with a long-arm cast overwrap applied at the initial clinic visit. Primary outcome was radiographic LOR which was defined as a change of >10 degrees of angulation on anterior posterior/lateral projections from initial postreduction radiograph or previous follow-up radiograph. The secondary outcome was the need for further intervention. RESULTS Sixty-four (38%) patients demonstrated radiographic LOR with 90% of LORs occurring in the first 2 weeks. LOR was significantly more common in distal radius fractures [48/110 (44%)] than with either proximal [2/14 (14%), P=0.04] or mid-shaft radius fractures [7/41 (17%), P=0.004]. There was no difference in LOR by location for ulna fractures [proximal=2/13 (15%), middle=4/38 (11%), distal=20/77 (26%), P>0.08]. There was no difference in radial LOR in patients with isolated radius fractures compared with both bone forearm fracture (17/40 vs. 40/125, P=0.22), or ulnar LOR between isolated ulna and both bone forearm fracture (0/3 vs. 26/125, P>0.99). CONCLUSION The sugar-tong splint is effective at maintaining reduction of pediatric forearm fractures similar to published rates for casting. While effective at all levels of the forearm, the sugar-tong splint performed best in proximal and mid-shaft forearm fractures.

However, both techniques are not devoid of disadvantages and complications. In this article, we define an alternative, novel 'double-hole' technique, which is based on opening the right atrium without cardiopulmonary bypass. METHODS Bovine hearts were obtained from a local supermarket. Two purse-string sutures were placed in the right atrium using 2-0 braided, non-absorbable polyester suture material, one close to the auricle, and the other close to the interatrial septum. The guidewire of a haemodialysis catheter was inserted through the superior vena cava into the right atrium and passed all the way through the right ventricle. RESULTS We suggest that the double-hole technique may be useful, especially in revision cases with adhesions. Further research should be performed to document the efficacy and safety of this method. CONCLUSION We are aware that further extensive research is necessary to investigate the utility of this novel technique in contemporary cardiovascular surgery. We believe the doublehole technique has the potential to become a safe, practical and effective measure in the future.","Bozok, Sahin; Ilhan, Gokhan; Kazdal, Hizir; Ozpak, Berkan; Yurekli, Ismail; Bayrak, Serdar; Kestelli, Mert",Cardiovascular journal of Africa,https://doi.org/10.5830/cvja-2016-020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27078129/,259

A literature review revealed few reports providing front-line clinical and research teams guidance related to multilevel, rapidly evolving COVID-19 directives.Method: The Rapid Assessment Procedure Informed Clinical Ethnography (RAPICE) method was used to develop a clinical case series and conduct participant observation during an ongoing comparative effectiveness trial of peer-integrated, patient-centered interventions after traumatic injury. Participants were patients enrolled in the intervention arm of the ongoing trial, as well as front-line clinicians, patient peer interventionists, and clinical research team members implementing the trial. All participants were exposed to the Washington State COVID-19 outbreak.Results: Primary and secondary COVID-19 prevention strategies were feasibly integrated into ongoing care coordination and behavioral interventions for at-risk patients.

Less attention to diabetes management (glucose control, medication adherence, and diabetes self-management behaviors) during active cancer treatment is hypothesized as an explanation for worse outcomes among diabetic cancer patients. The objective of this systematic review is to determine and quantify how a cancer diagnosis impacts diabetes management. METHODS Quantitative and qualitative studies evaluating diabetes management among patients were identified by searching 4 databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library, and Web of Science. Two independent reviewers extracted data and summarized results from eligible studies. Study quality was formally assessed. RESULTS Thirty-six studies met all inclusion criteria. We observed heterogeneity across studies in terms of study design, sample size, cancer site, type of diabetes management evaluated, and quality. Numerous articles discussed that overall, glucose control, medication adherence, and diabetes self-management behaviors declined following a cancer diagnosis. However, findings were inconsistent across studies. CONCLUSIONS Although the effects of a cancer diagnosis on diabetes management are mixed, when results across studies were synthesized together, diabetes management appeared to generally decline after a cancer diagnosis. Declines in diabetes management seem to be primarily due to shifts in the priority of care from diabetes management to cancer. A next critical step in this line of work is to identify patient and provider level predictors of better or worse diabetes management to design and test interventions aimed at improving effective diabetes management for cancer patients.","Pinheiro, Laura C; Kaur, Harveen; Nilo, Daniela; Safford, Monika M; DeRosa, Antonio P; Kern, Lisa M",American journal of clinical oncology,https://doi.org/10.1097/coc.0000000000000612; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31592804/,259

In this regard, orotracheal intubation has been universally recognized as a maneuver with a high risk of viral transmission. On the other hand, rapid sequence induction, which represents the gold standard for limiting the risk of transmission for health care professionals, implies side effects that can be potentially harmful for patients with impaired hemodynamics. In this regard, the authors report a particular type of rapid induction that they are performing in a systematic way during the recent pandemic in cardiac surgery patients. This is performed after the patient reaches a deep analgesic plan, thanks to the unique characteristics of the opioid remifentanil. This type of induction, already tested in vasculopathic patients who underwent carotid surgery, is characterized by great hemodynamic stability and is very advantageous, in the writer's experience, when rapid sequence induction has to be systematically applied to cardiovascular patients, especially if you only want to protect operators.","Bevilacqua, Sergio; Bottari, Vanessa; Galeotti, Ilaria",Seminars in cardiothoracic and vascular anesthesia,https://doi.org/10.1177/1089253220941369; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32664787/,259

The economic and social burden that breast cancer places on societies has propelled research that analyzes the role of modifiable risk factors as the primary prevention methods. Healthy behavior changes, moderated alcohol intake, healthy body weight, and regular physical activity may decrease the risk of breast cancer among women. This review aimed to synthesize evidence on the cost-effectiveness of lifestyle-related interventions for the primary prevention of breast cancer in order to answer the question on whether implementing interventions focused on behavior changes are worth the value for money. Methods: A rapid review was performed using search terms developed by the research team. The articles were retrieved from MEDLINE and the Tufts Medical Center Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Registry, with an additional web search in Google and Google Scholar. Comparisons were performed on the cost-effectiveness ratio per quality-adjusted life-year between the interventions using a league table, and the likelihood of cost-effective interventions for breast cancer primary prevention was analyzed. Results: Six studies were selected. The median cost-effectiveness ratio (in 2018 USD) was $24,973, and 80% of the interventions had a ratio below the $50,000 threshold. The low-fat-diet program for postmenopausal women was cost-effective at a societal level, and the physical activity interventions, such as the Be Active Program in the UK, had the best cost saving results. A total of 11 of the 25 interventions ranked either as highly or very highly likely to be cost-effective for breast cancer primary preventions. Conclusion: Although the review had some limitations due to using only a few studies, it showed evidence that diet-related and physical-activity-related interventions for the primary prevention of breast cancer were cost-effective. Many of the cost-effective interventions aimed to reduce the risk of non-communicable diseases alongside breast cancer.","Bellanger, Martine; Barry, Katharine; Rana, Juwel; Regnaux, Jean-Philippe",Frontiers in medicine,https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2019.00325; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32117999/,259

134290,The Dual Burden of Type 1 Diabetes and COVID-19.,2021-01-26,"PURPOSE Improved risk stratification and predictive biomarkers of treatment response are needed for non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). Here we assessed the clinical utility of targeted RNA and DNA molecular profiling in NMIBC. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN Gene expression in NMIBC samples was profiled by NanoString nCounter, a RNA quantification platform, from two independent cohorts (n = 28, n = 50); targeted panel sequencing was performed in a subgroup (n = 50). Gene signatures were externally validated using two RNAseq datasets of NMIBC tumors (n = 438, n=73). Established molecular subtype classifiers and novel gene expression signatures were assessed for associations with clinicopathologic characteristics, somatic tumor mutations, and treatment outcomes. RESULTS Molecular subtypes distinguished between low-grade Ta tumors with FGFR3 mutations and overexpression (UROMOL-class 1) and tumors with more aggressive clinicopathologic characteristics (UROMOL-classes 2 and 3), which were significantly enriched with TERT promoter mutations. However, UROMOL subclasses were not associated with recurrence after bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) immunotherapy in two independent cohorts. In contrast, a novel expression signature of an inflamed tumor microenvironment (TME) was associated with improved recurrence-free survival after BCG. Expression of immune checkpoint genes (PD-L1/PD-1/CTLA-4) was associated with an inflamed TME, but not with higher recurrence rates after BCG. FGFR3 mutations and overexpression were both associated with low immune signatures. CONCLUSIONS Assessment of the immune TME, rather than molecular subtypes, is a promising predictive biomarker of BCG response. Modulating the TME in an immunologically ""cold"" tumor warrants further investigation. Integrated transcriptomic and exome sequencing should improve treatment selection in NMIBC.","Damrauer, Jeffrey S; Roell, Kyle R; Smith, Markia A; Sun, Xuezheng; Kirk, Erin L; Hoadley, Katherine A; Benefield, Halei C; Iyer, Gopakumar; Solit, David B; Milowsky, Matthew I; Kim, William Y; Nielsen, Matthew E; Wobker, Sara E; Dalbagni, Guido; Al-Ahmadie, Hikmat A; Olshan, Andrew F; Bochner, Bernard H; Furberg, Helena; Troester, Melissa A; Pietzak, Eugene J",Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,https://doi.org/10.1158/1078-0432.ccr-21-0205; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34117034/,259

Yet, there are few randomized trials demonstrating that reducing SB improves cardiovascular health. The Effect of Reducing Sedentary Behavior on Blood Pressure (RESET BP) randomized clinical trial addresses this gap by testing the effect of a 3-month SB reduction intervention on resting systolic BP. Secondary outcomes include other BP measures, pulse wave velocity, plasma renin activity and aldosterone, and objectively-measured SB (via thigh-mounted activPAL) and physical activity (via waist-worn GT3X accelerometer). RESET BP has a targeted recruitment of 300 adults with desk jobs, along with elevated, non-medicated BP (systolic BP 120-159 mmHg or diastolic BP 80-99 mmHg) and physical inactivity (self-reported aerobic physical activity below recommended levels). The multi-component intervention promotes 2-4 fewer hours of SB per day by replacing sitting with standing and light-intensity movement breaks. Participants assigned to the intervention condition receive a sit-stand desk attachment, a wrist-worn activity prompter, behavioral counseling every two weeks (alternating in-person and phone), and twice-weekly automated text messages. Herein, we review the study rationale, describe and evaluate recruitment strategies based on enrollment to date, and detail the intervention and assessment protocols.

This study represents the first assessment of rates of anxiety and depression in the general population of Ireland during the pandemic. AIMS Our first aim was to estimate the probable prevalence rates of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and depression, and to identify sociodemographic risk factors associated with screening positive for GAD or depression. Our second aim was to determine if COVID-19 related anxiety was highest amongst those in society at greatest risk of morality from COVID-19. METHOD Self-report data was collected from a nationally representative Irish sample (N = 1,041) online between March 31st and April 5th ; the first week of the nationwide quarantine measures. Recognised cut-off scores on the GAD-7 and PHQ-9 were used to estimate rates of GAD and depression. Correlates of screening positive for GAD or depression were assessed using logistic regression analysis. RESULTS GAD (20.0%), depression (22.8%), and GAD or depression (27.7%) were common. Screening positive for GAD or depression was associated with younger age, female sex, loss of income due to COVID-19, COVID-19 infection, and higher perceived risk of COVID-19 infection. Citizens aged 65 and older had significantly higher levels of COVID-19 related anxiety than adults aged 18-34. CONCLUSIONS Initial results from this multi-wave study monitoring changes in population anxiety and depression throughout the pandemic indicate that GAD and depression were common experiences in the population during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Hyland, Philip; Shevlin, Mark; McBride, Orla; Murphy, Jamie; Karatzias, Thanos; Bentall, Richard P; Martinez, Anton; Vallières, Frédérique",Acta psychiatrica Scandinavica,https://doi.org/10.1111/acps.13219; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32716520/,259
138307,Examination of psychological risk factors for chronic pain following cardiac surgery: protocol for a prospective observational study.,2019,"Accumulating evidence suggests that many immune responses are influenced by local nutrient concentrations in addition to the programming of intermediary metabolism within immune cells. Humoral immunity and germinal centers (GC) are settings in which these factors are under active investigation. Hypoxia is an example of how a particular nutrient is distributed in lymphoid follicles during an antibody response, and how oxygen sensors may impact the qualities of antibody output after immunization. Using exclusively a bio-informatic analysis of mRNA levels in GC and other B cells, recent work challenged the concept that there is any hypoxia or that it has any influence. To explore this proposition, we performed new analyses of published genomics data, explored potential sources of disparity, and elucidated aspects of the apparently conflicting conclusions. Specifically, replicability and variance among data sets derived from different naïve as well as GC B cells were considered. The results highlight broader issues that merit consideration, especially at a time of heightened focus on scientific reports in the realm of immunity and antibody responses. Based on these analyses, a standard is proposed under which the relationship of new data sets should be compared to prior ""fingerprints"" of cell types and reported transparently to referees and readers. In light of independent evidence of diversity within and among GC elicited by protein immunization, avoidance of overly broad conclusions about germinal centers in general when experimental systems are subject to substantial constraints imposed by technical features also is warranted.","Boothby, Mark R; Raybuck, Ariel; Cho, Sung Hoon; Stengel, Kristy R; Haase, Volker H; Hiebert, Scott; Li, Jingxin",Frontiers in immunology,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.664249; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34040610/,259

The aim of this study was to report on QoL and other functional outcomes in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD). METHOD This was a cross-sectional study. Two samples of older patients (>60 years old) either conservatively managed (CM) or receiving hospital-based haemodialysis (HD), compared Kidney Disease Quality of Life (KDQoL-36) outcomes. RESULTS Data from 263 CM patients (CKD 4 n=188, mean age 73.6 years, 48 women; CKD 5 n=75, mean age 74.4 years, 26 women) and 74 patients on HD (mean age 73.8 years, 24 women) were analysed. Significant group differences were identified for two subscales of KDQoL-36. Symptoms/Problems List subscale was significantly better for those receiving HD compared with those CM with CKD 5 (p=<0.001). Symptom/Problem List scores of CM CKD stage 4 patients were not significantly different compared with HD patients but were significantly better than CM CKD stage 5 patients (p<0.001). Burden of Kidney Disease subscale was significantly better for both CKD 4 (p<0.001) and CKD 5 (p<0.001) CM patients when compared with those receiving HD. CONCLUSION Symptoms of advanced CKD significantly impact QoL for patients CM with CKD stage 5. Conversely, QoL is significantly impacted for those in receipt of HD due to the burden of treatment. These findings provide evidence for the use of QoL tools to help with clinical prognostication in advanced CKD. Using QoL tools will ensure specialist support is available for appropriate management of patients with CKD.","McKeaveney, Clare; Witham, Miles; Alamrani, Abrar O; Maxwell, Alexander Peter; Mullan, Robert; Noble, Helen; Shields, Joanne; Reid, Joanne",BMJ supportive & palliative care,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjspcare-2020-002237; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32917654/,259

In the community setting, chronic pain has been shown to be related to frailty, a syndrome more commonly seen in older adults and characterized by limited physiologic reserve and ability to withstand stressors. While frailty is an important preoperative risk factor for poor surgical outcomes in older adults, the relationship between frailty and postsurgical pain in this population has not been investigated. We hypothesized that preoperative frailty would be associated with greater odds of postsurgical chronic pain. METHODS We conducted a prospective cohort study of 116 patients older than 65 years old who underwent major elective non-cardiac surgery. Patients were assessed for frailty within 30 days prior to surgery using the FRAIL Scale assessment and pain was evaluated before surgery and at 3 months after surgery using the Geriatric Pain Measure. RESULTS After adjusting for baseline characteristics, we found that frail patients were almost five times more likely to have intrusive postsurgical pain compared with patients who were not frail (OR 4.73, 95% CI 1.24 to 18.09). Intrusive preoperative pain and spine surgery were also associated with increased postsurgical pain (OR 10.13, 95% CI 2.81 to 36.57 and OR 4.02, 95% CI 1.22 to 13.17, respectively). CONCLUSION Although future studies are needed to establish a causal relationship between preoperative frailty and postsurgical pain, our findings suggest that older patients should have preoperative frailty assessments and frail older adults may need additional resources to improve postsurgical pain outcomes.

140414,Correction: Patient Trajectories Among Persons Hospitalized for COVID-19.,2020-11-10,"Despite growing experience due to increasing patient numbers, the intensive care treatment of patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia continues to be a particular challenge in individual cases, which may also therefore legitimize individualized therapeutic attempts. In this context, the so-called hyperinflammation syndrome characterized by a cytokine storm accompanied by a massive increase in inflammatory markers such as interleukin(IL)-6, represents such a situation. This case report describes the therapeutic approach of using the IL-6-specific antibody tocilizumab in combination with hemoadsorption therapy (CytoSorb) in a 58-year-old male patient with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. The patient suffered a massive clinical deterioration with concomitant Horovitz index of 127 mmHg that occurred on the 6th day of ventilation. After combined application of the above-mentioned therapeutic approaches, the patient stabilized rapidly paralleled by a significant increase in the Horovitz index, and the possibility of de-escalating the ventilation regimen, which ultimately enabled successful extubation after only 13 days of ventilation. Moreover, the combined treatment was associated with significant hemodynamic stabilization and a consecutive reduction in vasopressor doses, while hyperinflammation could be kept well under control. The incorporation of the hemoadsorber into the therapeutic regimen proved to be safe and straightforward. In conclusion, the combination of CytoSorb therapy and IL-6 blockade by tocilizumab appeared, at least in this case, to be an effective measure to modulate an overshooting immune response in COVID-19 pneumonia with a concomitant clinical improvement in both respiratory and hemodynamic function, and thus could be used as a potential therapeutic option in this clinical picture.","Kornitzky, F W; Langen, H-J; Held, M",Pneumologie,https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1458-4080; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33882609/,259

METHODS We analyzed combined individual patient data from 3 multicenter cohorts of consecutive patients with CeAD (the Cervical Artery Dissection and Ischemic Stroke Patients [CADISP]-Plus consortium dataset). Patients with data on DAO and functional outcome were included. We compared patients with DAO to those without DAO. Primary outcome was favorable functional outcome (i.e., modified Rankin Scale [mRS] score 0-1) measured 3-6 months from baseline. Secondary outcomes included delayed cerebral ischemia, major hemorrhage, recurrent CeAD, and death. We performed univariate and multivariable binary logistic regression analyses and calculated odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI), with adjustment for potential confounders. RESULTS Of 2,148 patients (median age 45 years [interquartile range (IQR) 38-52], 43.6% women), 728 (33.9%) had DAO. Patients with DAO more frequently presented with cerebral ischemia (84.6% vs 58.5%, p < 0.001). Patients with DAO were less likely to have favorable outcome when compared to patients without DAO (mRS 0-1: 59.6% vs 80.1%, p unadjusted < 0.001). After adjustment for age, sex, and initial stroke severity, DAO was independently associated with less favorable outcome (mRS 0-1: OR 0.65, CI 0.50-0.84, p = 0.001). Delayed cerebral ischemia occurred more frequently in patients with DAO than in patients without DAO (4.5% vs 2.9%, p = 0.059). CONCLUSION DAO independently predicts less favorable functional outcome in patients with CeAD.

The underlying concept is to reduce invasiveness and morbidity, by minimising intercostal nerve trauma, without any concession on safety and carcinologic issues. This study describes and evaluates our initial experience in multiportal SVATS, compared to conventional VATS (CVATS). Methods Between June 2016 and October 2017, 75 consecutive patients underwent major pulmonary resection with an original multiportal SVATS approach developed through a single or double access under the costal arch, unsystematically associated with intercostal ports for 5-mm instruments only. We retrospectively compared results of this SVATS group (n=75) against an historic CVATS group (n=75). Results Fifty-one lobectomies, 20 segmentectomies and 4 pneumonectomies were achieved through multiportal SVATS. Sixty-eight malignant lesions and 7 benign lesions were noted. All patients with primary lung cancer underwent R0 resection and complete lymphadenectomy, with 11% of clinical N0 upstaging. When compared, the SVATS and CVATS groups were similar in terms of demographics and pathology. No statistical differences were observed in terms of conversion (9% vs. 12%), mean operative time (157 vs. 155 min), morbidity (24% vs. 32%) and 30-day mortality (0% vs. 1.3%). The SVATS group had a significantly shorter length of drainage (median: 1 vs. 3 days, P<0.001), and a shorter postoperative length of stay (median: 2 vs. 4 days, P<0.001). Comfortable pain relief on postoperative day 1 (Numeric Rating Scale ≤3) was equally achieved (96% vs. 93%) with a significantly simplified SVATS analgesic protocol (local block and opioid-free oral analgesia) compared to the CVATS analgesic protocol (paravertebral catheter and opioid-free oral analgesia). SVATS group presented significantly less patients with persistent morphine use at day 7 (4% vs. 15%, P=0.04). Conclusions Multiportal SVATS is a safe, carcinologic and reproducible approach for major pulmonary resection. By avoiding intercostal strains, it enables a high compliance to opioid-free analgesic protocol, contributing to significantly shorter hospitalisation and better recovery, compared to CVATS.","Pfeuty, Karel; Lenot, Bernard",Journal of thoracic disease,https://doi.org/10.21037/jtd.2019.07.21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31463106/,259

The uptake and metabolism of the amino acid glutamine is essential for effector T cell activation. Since the growth and expansion of tumor cells relies on similar anabolic and metabolic requirements, we hypothesized that glutamine blockage might represent a promising strategy to promote allograft survival while inhibit tumor growth. 6-Diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (DON) was used as a glutamine antagonist. First, an in vitro study of T cell proliferation was performed to examine the ability of glutamine antagonism to inhibit T cell proliferation. Then we investigated whether DON could prolong allograft survival and inhibit tumor growth by using a fully MHC-mismatched mice full thickness skin transplantation model and a mice TC-1 tumor-bearing model. The proliferation study demonstrated that DON inhibited effector T cells proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. We found a marked prolonged graft median survival time and significant tumor inhibition for mice that received DON compared to those that received no treatment. These results highlight that targeting glutamine metabolism can promote allograft acceptance in a long tumor-free period.","Lee, Chen-Fang; Cheng, Chih-Hsien; Hung, Hao-Chien; Chan, Kun-Ming; Lee, Wei-Chen",Transplant immunology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trim.2020.101336; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32937197/,259

CT contacts data over 12 months (1 December 2018-29 November 2019) at a UK sexual health clinic were analysed to determine the appropriateness of the currently recommended six-month 'look-back' interval. Age and sex of CT contacts were associated with clinical outcomes. Subgroups of 100 CT positive/negative contacts (each N = 100) were randomly selected. The relationship between time since sexual intercourse with the index case (Last Sexual Intercourse; LSI) and CT positivity was examined; suitability of varying look-back intervals was explored. Of 891 CT contacts (mean age = 25.0 years, 66.2% men), 66.9% tested positive for CT. Positive CT contacts were significantly younger (23.8 ± 6.8 years vs. 27.4 ± 9.1, p < 0.001) and more often women (36.4% vs. 28.5%, p = 0.018) than negative contacts. In the subgroups, the Mann-Whitney U test revealed no significant difference between the LSI of positive and negative contacts (p = 0.081). 95% of positive CT contacts (N = 82) were captured within a hypothetical three-month look-back interval. While most CT positive contacts were captured within three months, they appeared to remain proportionately represented beyond this point.

In the absence of robust preventive or curative strategies, the implementation of social distancing has been a key component of limiting the spread of the virus. METHODS Daily estimates of R(t) were calculated and compared with measures of social distancing made publicly available by Unacast. Daily generated variables representing an overall grade for distancing, changes in distances traveled, encounters between individuals, and daily visitation, were modeled as predictors of average R value for the following week, using linear regression techniques for 8 counties surrounding the city of Syracuse, New York. Supplementary analysis examined differences between counties. RESULTS A total of 225 observations were available across the 8 counties, with 166 meeting the mean R(t) < 3 outlier criterion for the regression models. Measurements for distance (β = 1.002, P = .012), visitation (β = .887, P = .017), and encounters (β = 1.070, P = .001) were each predictors of R(t) for the following week. Mean R(t) drops when overall distancing grades move from D+ to C-. These trends were significant (P < .001 for each). CONCLUSIONS Social distancing, when assessed by free and publicly available measures such as those shared by Unacast, has an impact on viral transmission rates. The scorecard may also be useful for public messaging about social distance, in hospital planning, and in the interpretation of epidemiological models.","Morley, Christopher P; Anderson, Kathryn B; Shaw, Jana; Stewart, Telisa; Thomas, Stephen J; Wang, Dongliang",Journal of public health management and practice : JPHMP,https://doi.org/10.1097/phh.0000000000001240; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32694481/,259
148489,Percutaneous and Open Tracheostomy in Patients with COVID-19: Comparison and Outcomes of an Institutional Series in New York City.,2020-09-01,"Aiming to design (99m) Tc complexes for probing nitric oxide synthase (NOS) by SPECT, we synthesized conjugates (L4-L6) comprising a NOS-recognizing moiety connected to a diamino-propionic acid (dap) chelating unit. The conjugates led to complexes of the type fac-[M(CO)3 (ĸ(3) -L)] (M = Re/(99m) Tc; Re4/Tc4: L = L4; Re5/Tc5: L = L5; Re6/Tc6: L = L6). Enzymatic studies showed that L4 and L5, but not L6, gave complexes (Re4 and Re5) that are less potent than the conjugates. To rationalize these results, we performed docking and molecular dynamics simulations. The high affinity of L4 and L5 is due to the strong interactions between the dap chelator and polar residues of the binding cavity. These interactions are hampered by metallation resulting in complexes with lower affinity. The higher potency of Re5 compared to Re4 was assigned to the increased bulkiness of Re5 and the presence of additional anchoring groups that better fit the active site and provide more extensive contacts. In turn, Re6 is too bulky and its organometallic tail is oriented toward the peripheral pocket of iNOS, leading to loss of contacts and a lower affinity. These results were compared with our previous results obtained with analogue complexes stabilized by a pyrazolyl-diamine chelating unit.","Oliveira, Bruno L; Morais, Maurício; Mendes, Filipa; Moreira, Irina S; Cordeiro, Carlos; Fernandes, Pedro A; Ramos, Maria J; Alberto, Roger; Santos, Isabel; Correia, João D G",Chemical biology & drug design,https://doi.org/10.1111/cbdd.12575; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25894011/,259

Abdominal Radiology is the largest radiology subspecialty fellowship that remains outside of the Match. The Society of Abdominal Radiology convened a task force in 2019 to assess stakeholder viewpoints on a Match and found that the community was divided. Radiology departments and Abdominal Radiology fellowship program directors have voluntarily complied with a series of guidelines laid out by the Society of Chairs in Academic Radiology Departments during the two most recent recruiting cycles, but challenges in the process persist. Stakeholders report improved organization and fairness as a result of these procedural changes, and the authors suggest that Abdominal Radiology may continue to consider a formal fellowship Match in coming years.","Gupta, Rajan T; Caserta, Melanie P; Magudia, Kirti; Masch, William R; Millet, John D; Sugi, Mark D; Wildman-Tobriner, Benjamin; Maturen, Katherine E",Abdominal radiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00261-021-03257-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34482413/,259
148660,Does caesarean delivery in the first pregnancy increase the risk for adverse outcome in the second? A registry-based cohort study on first and second singleton births in Norway.,2020-08-23,"BACKGROUND Previous research has found racial differences in hospice knowledge and misconceptions about hospice care, which may hinder access to hospice care. Asian Indians are a rapidly growing population in the United States, yet limited research has focused on their beliefs toward end-of-life care. This project investigates Indian Americans' knowledge of and attitudes toward hospice care and advance care planning. PROCEDURES A cross-sectional design was employed using surveys about participants' knowledge of and attitudes toward hospice care and advance care planning. Surveys were conducted among Indian Americans, age 60 and over, recruited from Indian cultural centers in Northern California. The participants were first asked questions about hospice care. They were then given a summary explanation of hospice care and later asked about their attitudes toward hospice care. Data were analyzed using descriptive and bivariate analyses. RESULTS Surveys were completed by 82 participants. Findings revealed that 42.5% of respondents had an advance directive and 57.1% had named a health care proxy. Only 10% of respondents had known someone on hospice care and 10.4% correctly answered 4-5 of the knowledge questions. After being informed about hospice care, 69.6% of participants agreed that if a family member was extremely ill, they would consider enrolling him/her in hospice. CONCLUSIONS This study's results present a need for greater education about hospice services among older Asian Indians. Health practitioners should remain cognizant of potential misconceptions of hospice and cultural barriers that Asian Indians may have toward hospice care, so they can tailor conversations accordingly.","Shirsat, Nikita; Hoe, Deborah; Enguidanos, Susan",The American journal of hospice & palliative care,https://doi.org/10.1177/1049909120969128; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33107333/,259
148762,Incidence and Severity of COVID-19 in HIV-Positive Persons Receiving Antiretroviral Therapy.,2021-04-01,"PURPOSE To demonstrate our technical approach for robot-assisted ureteroneocystostomy (R-UNC) for benign and malignant distal ureteral pathologies. MATERIALS AND METHODS Between January 2009 and January 2013, a total of 10 patients underwent R-UNC in the distal ureter by a single surgeon. Indications for R-UNC were as follows: idiopathic (3), fistula (2), iatrogenic (2), malignancy (2), and chronic vesicoureteral reflux (1). RESULTS Tension-free anastomosis was attained in all 10 R-UNC procedures. A psoas hitch was performed in 6/10 cases (60%). Intravesical and extravesical reimplantations were completed in 5/10 (50%) and 5/10 cases (50%), respectively. A nonrefluxing ureter was constructed in 2/10 cases (20%). The patients' mean age was 52.9±16.6 years, their mean body mass index was 30.8±6.3 kg/m(2), the mean operative time was 211.7±69.3 minutes, mean estimated blood loss was 102.5±110.8 mL, and mean length of stay was 2.8±2.3 days. There were no intraoperative complications. There was one Clavien-Dindo grade I and one Clavien-Dindo grade II postoperative complication. The mean postoperative follow-up duration was 28.5±15.5 months. Two patients had recurrence of ureteral strictures at 3 months postoperatively and were managed successfully with balloon dilation. CONCLUSIONS Our technique for R-UNC demonstrates good perioperative outcomes. However, underlying periureteral inflammation and pelvic adhesions may predispose patients for stricture recurrence after R-UNC.","Lee, Ziho; Sehgal, Shailen; Llukani, Elton; Reilly, Christopher; Doumanian, Leo; Mydlo, Jack; Lee, David Inkoo; Eun, Daniel Dong-In",Korean journal of urology,https://doi.org/10.4111/kju.2013.54.8.516; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23956826/,259

OBJECTIVE The aim of this article is to describe initiatives to ensure ongoing access to medications during the COVID-19 pandemic. DISCUSSION Cooperation between wholesalers and purchase limits in pharmacies have helped to ensure supply of essential medications. Therapeutic substitution by pharmacists is permitted for specific products authorised by the Therapeutic Goods Administration. Prescribers are permitted to issue digital image prescriptions, and implementation of electronic prescribing has been fast-tracked. Expanded continued dispensing arrangements introduced during the bushfire crises have been temporarily extended. Pharmacists are permitted to provide medication management reviews via telehealth. A Home Medicines Service has been introduced to facilitate delivery of medications to people who are vulnerable or elderly. Anticipatory prescribing and medication imprest systems are valuable for access to end-of-life medications within residential aged care.","Bell, J Simon; Reynolds, Lorenna; Freeman, Christopher; Jackson, John K",Australian journal of general practice,https://doi.org/10.31128/ajgp-04-20-5390; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32738870/,259

METHODS We performed a retrospective review of all adolescents between the ages of 15 and 19 who underwent LAGB or LRYGB at our university affiliated Bariatric Center of Excellence from 2002 to 2011. Postsurgical weight loss at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months was noted and expressed as percentage of excess weight loss (% EWL). RESULTS Thirty-two patients underwent LRYGB and 23 underwent LAGB. The LAGB group was younger (18.6 ± 0.6 versus 17.2 ± 1.5) than the LRYGB group. Other preoperative demographic factors including body mass index, gender, ethnicity, and comorbidities were similar between the two groups. The average % EWL was superior in the LRYGB group compared to the LAGB group at all time points studied (p < 0.05), although at 2-year follow-up, only 16% (5/32) LRYGB and 30% (7/23) LAGB patients were available for follow-up. Three patients with type II diabetes mellitus underwent LRYGB and all experienced remission of their diabetes. The number of complications requiring interventions was similar between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS In our study, adolescents undergoing LRYGB achieved superior weight loss compared to LAGB in the short-term follow-up. The complication rate for LAGB was similar compared to LRYGB. More studies are needed to monitor the long-term effects of these operations on adolescents before definitive recommendations can be made.","Lee, David Y; Guend, Hamza; Park, Koji; Levine, Jun; Ross, Ronald E; McGinty, James J; Teixeira, Julio A",Obesity surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-012-0742-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22923312/,259

149775,Correlation Between N95 Extended Use and Reuse and Fit Failure in an Emergency Department.,2020-06-04,"BACKGROUND During the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of protection masks is essential to reduce contagions. However, public opinion reports an associated subjective shortness of breath. We evaluated cardiorespiratory parameters at rest and during maximal exertion to highlight any differences with the use of protection masks. METHODS Twelve healthy subjects underwent three cardiopulmonary exercise tests: without wearing protection mask, with surgical and with FFP2 mask. Dyspnea was assessed by Borg Scale. Standard pulmonary function tests were also performed. RESULTS All the subjects (40.8±12.4 years; 6 males) completed the protocol with no adverse event. At spirometry, from no mask to surgical to FFP2, a progressive reduction of FEV1 and FVC was observed (3.94±0.91 l, 3.23±0.81 l, 2.94±0.98 l and 4.70±1.21 l, 3.77±1.02 l, 3.52±1.21 l, respectively, p<0.001). Rest ventilation, O2 uptake (V̇O2) and CO2 production (VCO2) were progressively lower with a reduction of respiratory rate. At peak exercise, subjects revealed a progressively higher Borg scale when wearing surgical and FFP2. Accordingly, at peak exercise, V̇O2 (31.0±23.4, 27.5±6.9, 28.2±8.8 ml/kg/min, p=0.001), ventilation (92±26, 76±22, 72±21 l, p=0.003), respiratory rate (42±8, 38±5, 37±4, p=0.04) and tidal volume (2.28±0.72, 2.05±0.60, 1.96±0.65 l, p=0.001) were gradually lower. We did not observed a significant difference in oxygen saturation. CONCLUSIONS Protection masks are associated with significant but modest worsening of spirometry and cardiorespiratory parameters at rest and peak exercise. The effect is driven by a ventilation reduction due to an increased airflow resistance. However, since exercise ventilatory limitation is far from being reached, their use is safe even during maximal exercise, with a slight reduction in performance.","Mapelli, Massimo; Salvioni, Elisabetta; De Martino, Fabiana; Mattavelli, Irene; Gugliandolo, Paola; Vignati, Carlo; Farina, Stefania; Palermo, Pietro; Campodonico, Jeness; Maragna, Riccardo; Lo Russo, Gerardo; Bonomi, Alice; Sciomer, Susanna; Agostoni, Piergiuseppe",The European respiratory journal,https://doi.org/10.1183/13993003.04473-2020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33678608/,259

We determined whether rapid recanalization and collateral circulation affect clinical outcomes after IAT. METHODS We retrospectively evaluated the clinical and radiological data of 134 consecutive patients who underwent IAT for intracranial artery occlusion. The interval from symptom onset to recanalization after IAT (onset-to-recanalization time) as an estimate of the probability of good clinical outcome (modified Rankin scale 0-2) was calculated in patients with collateral circulation in the ischemic hemisphere, which was rated poor (0/1 American Society of Interventional and Therapeutic Neuroradiology criteria) or good (2-4). Changes in National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NHISS) score before and after IAT and modified Rankins scale scores 3 months after discharge were compared with respect to onset-to-recanalization time. RESULTS In patients with good collateral circulation, the estimated onset-to-recanalization time for a 0.5 probability of a good clinical outcome was 347 minutes; with poor collateral circulation, it was 172 minutes for a 0.2 probability of good clinical outcome. Outcome analyses according to onset-to-recanalization time showed patients recanalized <6 hours had lower NHISS scores (<4.5, 4.5-6, >6 hours of onset-to-recanalization time, and non-recanalization: 5.1, 6.9, 11.9, and 19.8, respectively) at discharge and higher percentages of good clinical outcome (69%, 66.7%, 21.9%, and 0%, respectively) 3 months after IAT. CONCLUSIONS The time window to expect a high probability of a good clinical outcome after IAT is highly dependent on the collateral circulation.","Jeong, Hye Seon; Kwon, Hyon-Jo; Song, Hee-Jung; Koh, Hyeon-Song; Kim, Yong Soo; Lee, Ju Hun; Shin, Jee Eun; Lee, Suk Hoon; Kim, Jei",Journal of stroke,https://doi.org/10.5853/jos.2015.17.1.76; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25692110/,259

The child had previously received two bowel resections at the age of 1 yr, right pneumonectomy at the age of 3 yrs, and endoscopic percutaneus gastrostomy at the age of 10 yrs. After transplant, the child failed several attempts of weaning off mechanical ventilation with pressure-support ventilation, due to infection, pneumothorax, and ventilator asynchrony that caused gastric distension and numerous episodes of nausea and vomiting. INTERVENTION Use of neurally adjusted ventilatory assist to avoid patient-ventilator dyssynchrony and consequent gastric distension.

However, there is lack of accepted biomarkers to facilitate regulatory decision-making in the development of novel therapeutics for the treatment of CD. METHODS With support from the Helmsley Charitable Trust, Critical Path Institute formed the Crohn's Disease Biomarkers preconsortium (CDBpC) with members from the pharmaceutical industry, academia, and nonprofit organizations to evaluate the CD biomarker landscape. Biomarkers were evaluated based on biological relevance, availability of biomarker assays, and clinical validation data. RESULTS The CDBpC identified the most critical need as pharmacodynamic/response biomarkers to monitor disease activity in response to therapeutic intervention. Fecal calprotectin (FC) and serum C-reactive protein (CRP) were identified as biomarkers ready for the regulatory qualification process. A number of exploratory biomarkers and potential panels of these biomarkers was also identified for additional development. Given the different factors involved in CD and disease progression, a combination of biomarkers, including inflammatory, tissue injury, genetic, and microbiome-associated biomarkers, will likely have the most utility. CONCLUSIONS The primary focus of the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Regulatory Science Consortium will be development of exploratory biomarkers and the qualification of FC and CRP for IBD. The Inflammatory Bowel Disease Regulatory Science Consortium, focused on tools to support IBD drug development, will operate in the precompetitive space to share data, biological samples for biomarker testing, and assay information for novel biomarkers.","Porter, Amy C; Aubrecht, Jiri; Birch, Chandler; Braun, Jonathan; Cuff, Carolyn; Dasgupta, Suryasarathi; Gale, Jeremy D; Hinton, Robert; Hoffmann, Steven C; Honig, Gerard; Linggi, Bryan; Schito, Marco; Casteele, Niels Vande; Sauer, John-Michael",Inflammatory bowel diseases,https://doi.org/10.1093/ibd/izaa215; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32840322/,259

To estimate the frequency, costs associated with Depressive Disorders in usual clinical practice, and in the whole Spanish population, a longitudinal, retrospective, observational study was carried out using data from the BIG-PAC database®. Study population: all patients aged ≥ 18 years with a diagnosis of a Depressive Disorder in 2015-2017. Prevalence was computed as the proportion of Depressive Disorder cases in the adult general population, and the incidence rate, as the number of new Depressive Disorder cases diagnosed per 1,000 person-years in the population using health services, during 2015-2017. We collected demographic variables, comorbidity, direct health costs, and indirect costs (temporary and permanent disability). Health costs related to Depressive Disorders were estimated according to the annual resource use rate (resource/patient/year). Indirect costs were calculated according to the human capital method. Using the study data and information from the Spanish National Institute of Statistics, we estimated the cost of Depressive Disorders corresponding to the Spanish adult population, including premature mortality. 69,217 Depressive Disorder patients aged ≥ 18 years who met the inclusion/exclusion criteria were studied (mean age: 56.8 years; female: 71.4%). Prevalence of Depressive Disorders in the general population was 4.73% (95% CI: 4.70-4.76%). Annual incidence rates (2015-2017) were 7.12, 7.35 and 8.02 per 1,000 person-years, respectively. Total costs observed in our Depressive Disorder patients were € 223.9 million (corresponding to a mean of € 3,235.3; mean/patient/year), of which, 18.4% were direct health care costs and 81.6%, non-health indirect costs (18% temporary occupational disability, 63.6% permanent disability). Considering also the cost of premature death, the mean cost per patient/year was € 3,402 and the estimated societal costs of Depressive Disorders in Spain were € 6,145 million. The prevalence and incidence of Depressive Disorders are consistent with other series reviewed.

155126,Protocol for the development of Core Outcome Sets for Early intervention trials to Prevent Obesity in CHildren (COS-EPOCH).,2021-07-22,"BACKGROUND The COVID-19 pandemic has had wide-reaching primary and secondary health implications. The UK government implemented a national lockdown to slow the rate of infection at the end of March 2020, lasting until early summer 2020. The results from a UK nationwide survey suggest the majority of inflammatory bowel disease patients were followed up using technology-enabled care services (TECS) during this time. We therefore aimed to explore the impact of the pandemic on nutritional status of children with inflammatory bowel disease, focusing on the effect of national lockdown from March to early summer 2020. METHODS A retrospective study was conducted. All patients with a diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease, aged <18 years, and under the care of Southampton Children's Hospital were eligible for inclusion. Those patients who attended an outpatient appointment during time period 1 (November 2019 to February 2020), and following the period of national lockdown, time period 2 (July to November 2020), were included in the analysis. RESULTS In total, 116 patients had paired measures. Using the World Health Organization criteria of nutritional status, 19% (n = 22/116) were mildly malnourished with a body mass index Z score (BMIZ) < -1. In this group, the mean BMIZ was -1.3 ± 0.9 at time point 1 versus -1.9 ± 0.9 at time point 2 (p = 0.03). The mean BMIZ score of those children who were overweight at time point 1 was 1.2 ± 1.2 versus 1.6 ± 1.4 at time point 2 (p = 0.2) During the period of lockdown, 27% of malnourished children (n = 6/22), 2% of normally nourished children (BMIZ > -1 to < 1) (n = 1/51) (p ≤ 0.0001) and none of the overweight children (BMIZ > 1) (n = 0/43) children (p ≤ 0.0001) had a TECS nutrition review. CONCLUSIONS Dietetic reviews were severely restricted during the first national lockdown. Patients with low BMIZ prior to lockdown became more malnourished. During the ongoing pandemic, it is important to identify those children with nutrition risk, focusing support on this group of children.","Marino, Luise V; Ashton, James J; Beattie, Robert Mark",Journal of human nutrition and dietetics : the official journal of the British Dietetic Association,https://doi.org/10.1111/jhn.12862; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33560555/,259

Results Compared with personal experience tweets, tweets that both raised awareness and promoted intervention were 2.62 times as likely to be retweeted (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.62 [95% 1.79 to 3.85]) and if retweeted had 37% more retweets (adjusted prevalence ratio [aPR] 1.37 [95% CI 1.06 to 1.78]). Tweets that raised concerns about vaccine price were twice as likely to be retweeted (aOR 2.29 [95% CI 1.36 to 3.84]) and if retweeted, had double the retweet count (aPR 2.05 [95% CI 1.27 to 3.29]) of tweets sharing personal experience. Conclusions The #pneumonia tweets that both raised awareness and promoted interventions and those discussing vaccine price were more likely to engage users than tweets about personal experience. These results help health professionals craft WPD messages that will engage the audience.","Adnan, Md Mohiuddin; Yin, Jingjing; Jackson, Ashley M; Tse, Zion Tsz Ho; Liang, Hai; Fu, King-Wa; Saroha, Nitin; Althouse, Benjamin M; Fung, Isaac Chun-Hai",International health,https://doi.org/10.1093/inthealth/ihy087; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30476105/,259
157535,Twenty-four-week interim outcomes of bedaquiline-containing regimens in treatment of adolescents with rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis: A retrospective cohort study in China.,2021-07-29,"Background: Smaller studies suggest lower morbidity and mortality associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in women. Our aim is to assess the impact of female sex on outcomes in a large cohort of patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Materials and Methods: This is a retrospective observational cohort study of 10,630 adult patients hospitalized with a confirmed COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction between March 1, 2020 and April 27, 2020, with follow-up conducted through June 4, 2020. Logistic regression was used to examine the relationship between sex and the primary outcomes, including length of stay, admission to intensive care unit (ICU), need for mechanical ventilation, pressor requirement, and all-cause mortality as well as major adverse events and in-hospital COVID-19 treatments. Results: In the multivariable analysis, women had 27% lower odds of in-hospital mortality (odds ratio [OR] = 0.73, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.66-0.81; p < 0.001), 24% lower odds of ICU admission (OR = 0.76, 95% CI 0.69-0.84; p < 0.001), 26% lower odds of mechanical ventilation (OR = 0.74, 95% CI 0.66-0.82; p < 0.001), and 25% lower odds of vasopressor requirement (OR = 0.75, 95% CI 0.67-0.84; p < 0.001). Women had 34% less odds of having acute cardiac injury (OR = 0.66, 95% CI 0.59-0.74; p < 0.001; n = 7,289), 16% less odds of acute kidney injury (OR = 0.84, 95% CI 0.76-0.92; p < 0.001; n = 9,840), and 27% less odds of venous thromboembolism (OR = 0.73, 95% CI 0.56-0.96; p < 0.02; c-statistic 0.85, n = 9,407). Conclusions: Female sex is associated with lower odds of in-hospital outcomes, major adverse events, and all-cause mortality. There may be protective mechanisms inherent to female sex, which explain differences in COVID-19 outcomes.","Tejpal, Astha; Gianos, Eugenia; Cerise, Jane; Hirsch, Jamie S; Rosen, Stacey; Kohn, Nina; Lesser, Martin; Weinberg, Catherine; Majure, David; Satapathy, Sanjaya K; Bernstein, David; Barish, Matthew A; Spyropoulos, Alex C; Brown, Rachel-Maria",Journal of women's health,https://doi.org/10.1089/jwh.2020.8974; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33885345/,259

Methods: 29 patients with 2019-ncov admitted to the isolation ward of Tongji hospital affiliated to Tongji medical college of Huazhong University of Science and Technology in January 2020 were selected as the study subjects. Clinical data were collected and the general information, clinical symptoms, blood test and CT imaging characteristics were analyzed. According to the relevant diagnostic criteria, the patients were divided into three groups: mild (15 cases), severe (9 cases) and critical (5 cases). The expression levels of inflammatory cytokines and other markers in the serum of each group were detected, and the changes of these indicators of the three groups were compared and analyzed, as well as their relationship with the clinical classification of the disease. Results: (1) The main symptoms of 2019-nCoV pneumonia was fever (28/29) with or without respiratory and other systemic symptoms. Two patients died with underlying disease and co-bacterial infection, respectively. (2) The blood test of the patients showed normal or decreased white blood cell count (23/29), decreased lymphocyte count (20/29), increased hypersensitive C reactive protein (hs-CRP) (27/29), and normal procalcitonin. In most patients,serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was significantly increased (20/29), while albumin was decreased(15/29). Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin (Tbil), serum creatinine (Scr) and other items showed no significant changes. (3) CT findings of typical cases were single or multiple patchy ground glass shadows accompanied by septal thickening. When the disease progresses, the lesion increases and the scope expands, and the ground glass shadow coexists with the solid shadow or the stripe shadow. (4) There were statistically significant differences in the expression levels of interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R) and IL-6 in the serum of the three groups (P<0.05), among which the critical group was higher than the severe group and the severe group was higher than the mildgroup. However, there were no statistically significant differences in serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), IL-1, IL-8, IL-10, hs-CRP, lymphocyte count and LDH among the three groups (P>0.05). Conclusion: The clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV pneumonia are similar to those of common viral pneumonia. High resolution CT is of great value in the differential diagnosis of this disease. The increased expression of IL-2R and IL-6 in serum is expected to predict the severity of the 2019-nCoV pneumonia and the prognosis of patients.","Chen, L; Liu, H G; Liu, W; Liu, J; Liu, K; Shang, J; Deng, Y; Wei, S",Zhonghua jie he he hu xi za zhi = Zhonghua jiehe he huxi zazhi = Chinese journal of tuberculosis and respiratory diseases,https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.issn.1001-0939.2020.0005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32026671/,259

METHODS AND RESULTS All patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) at the Geneva University Hospitals for acute coronary syndromes (ACS) during the first COVID-19 wave were compared with a control group consisting of all ACS patients who underwent PCI during the same period in 2019 and those treated in the period immediately preceding the pandemic. The primary outcome measure was the difference in the delay from symptom onset to first medical contact in the setting of STEMI between the COVID-19 period and the control period. Secondary outcome measures were the difference in ACS incidence and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients’ decisions to call the emergency services, assessed using a questionnaire. Delay from symptom onset to first medical contact was longer among patients suffering from STEMI in the COVID-19 period compared with the control period (112 min vs 60 min, p = 0.049). The incidence rate of ACS was lower during the COVID-19 period (incidence rate ratio 0.6, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.449–0.905). ACS patients delayed their call to the emergency services mainly because of fear of contracting or spreading COVID-19 following hospital admission, as well as of adding burden to the healthcare system. CONCLUSION We observed prolonged delays from symptom onset to first medical contact and a decline in overall ACS incidence during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, with a higher threshold to call for help among ACS patients.","Perrin, Nils; Iglesias, Juan F; Rey, Florian; Benzakour, Lamyae; Cimci, Murat; Noble, Stephane; Degrauwe, Sophie; Tessitore, Elena; Mach, François; Roffi, Marco",Swiss medical weekly,https://doi.org/10.4414/smw.2020.20448; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33382905/,259
160620,Calculating positive and negative predictive values. Correction to Br J Anaesth 2021; 126: 564-7.,2021-04-27,"BACKGROUND Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) is a preventable cardiac condition that escalates risk in pregnancy. Models of care informed by evidence-based clinical guidelines are essential to optimal health outcomes. There are no published reviews that systematically explore approaches to care provision for pregnant women with RHD and examine reported measures. The review objective was to improve understanding of how attributes of care for these women are reported and how they align with guidelines. METHODS A search of 13 databases was supported by hand-searching. Papers that met inclusion criteria were appraised using CASP/JBI checklists. A content analysis of extracted data from the findings sections of included papers was undertaken, informed by attributes of quality care identified previously from existing guidelines. RESULTS The 43 included studies were predominantly conducted in tertiary care centers of low-income and middle-income countries. Cardiac guidelines were referred to in 25 of 43 studies. Poorer outcomes were associated with higher risk scores (detailed in 36 of 41 quantitative studies). Indicators associated with increased risk include anticoagulation during pregnancy (28 of 41 reported) and late booking (gestation documented in 15 of 41 studies). Limited access to cardiac interventions was discussed (19 of 43) in the context of poorer outcomes. Conversely, early assessment and access to regular multidisciplinary care were emphasized in promoting optimal outcomes for women and their babies. CONCLUSIONS Despite often complex care requirements in challenging environments, pregnancy provides an opportunity to strengthen health system responses and address whole-of-life health for women with RHD. A standard set of core indicators is proposed to more accurately benchmark care pathways, outcomes, and burden.","Vaughan, Geraldine; Dawson, Angela; Peek, Michael J; Carapetis, Jonathan R; Sullivan, Elizabeth A",Birth,https://doi.org/10.1111/birt.12435; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31150150/,259
161434,Effective Dose Titration of Fentanyl Sublingual Spray in Patients With Breakthrough Cancer Pain.,2016,"BACKGROUND The relationship between the width of surgical margins and local and distant recurrence of colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) remain controversial. We analyzed the impact of surgical margins in laparoscopic liver resections (LLR) for CRLM, using the parenchymal-sparing approach on overall (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS). METHODS From January 2005 to October 2012, 114 first LLR for CRLM were performed and retrospectively analyzed. The ultrasonic aspirator was used for parenchyma division. R1 margins were defined when the tissue width was <1 mm. RESULTS After a mean follow-up of 30.9 ± 1.71 months, OS was 97.1-73.9-58.9% and the RFS 64.2-35.2-31% at 1-3-5 years, respectively. The major resection rate was 7%. The median margin width was 3 (0-40) mm, and R1 resection was recorded in 14 (12.3%) cases. Twenty-two patients (33.3%) with hepatic recurrence underwent a repeat hepatectomy. R1 margins were significantly related to lower RFS survival (p = 0.038) but did not affect OS. Multivariate analysis showed that lesions located in postero-superior segments (HR = 2.4, 95% CI 1.24-4.61, p = 0.009) as well as blood loss (HR = 3.2, 95% CI 1.23-7.99, p = 0.012) were independent risk factors for tumor recurrence. The carcinoembryonic antigen level >10 mcg/L affected OS (HR = 4.2 95% CI 2.02-16.9, p = 0.001), and the resection of more than two tumors was significantly associated with R1 margins (HR = 9.32, 95% CI 1.14-32.5, p = 0.037). DISCUSSION Laparoscopic parenchymal-sparing surgery of CRLM does not compromise the oncological outcome, allowing a higher percentage of repeat hepatectomy. R1 margins are a risk factor for tumor recurrence but not for overall survival. The presence of multiple lesions is the only independent risk factor of R1 margins and also the major disadvantage of this technique.","Montalti, Roberto; Tomassini, Federico; Laurent, Stéphanie; Smeets, Peter; De Man, Marc; Geboes, Karen; Libbrecht, Louis J; Troisi, Roberto I",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-014-3999-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25427420/,259

However it is a challenge to construct 3D-hierarchical structures with sub-5 nm primary grain particle, which is the optimized size for ethanol sensor. Herein, genetic tri-level hierarchical SnO2 microstructures are synthesised by the genetic conversion of 3D hierarchical SnS2 flowers assembled by ultrathin nanosheets. The SnS2 nanosheets are morphology genetic converted to porous nanosheets with sub-5 nm SnO2 nanoparticles during the calcination process. When used for the detecton of ethanol, the sensor exhibits a high sensitivity of 0.5 ppm (Ra/Rg = 6.8) and excellent gas-sensing response (Ra/Rg =183 to 100 ppm) with short response/recovery time (12 s/11 s). The excellent gas sensing performance is much better than that of the previous reported SnO2-based sensors. The highly sensitivity is attributed to the large surface area derived from the recrystallization and volume changes, which offers more active sites during the morphology genetic conversion from SnS2 to SnO2. Furthermore, the flower-like 3D structure enhances the stability of the materials and is beneficial for the mass diffusion dynamics of ethanol.","Li, Wenqian; Yan, Changyu; Zhu, Yuedan; Tian, Heng; Hu, Jinhai; Iqbal, Asma; E, Peisan; Zai, Jiantao; Qian, Xuefeng",Nanotechnology,https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6528/ac2019; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34425561/,259
162166,Typical Electrocardiogram Pattern Unmasks Atypical Cause of Muscle Weakness.,2021-08-09,"Re-epithelialization is a crucial process to reestablish the protective barrier upon wounding of the skin. Although this process is well described for wounds where the complete epidermis and dermis is damaged, little is known about the re-epithelialization strategy in more frequently occurring smaller scratch wounds in which structures such as the hair follicles and sweat glands stay intact. To study this, we established a scratch wound model to follow individual keratinocytes in all epidermal layers in the back skin of mice by intravital microscopy. We discover that keratinocytes adopt a re-epithelialization strategy that enables them to bypass immobile obstacles such as hair follicles. Wound-induced cell loss is replenished by proliferation in a distinct zone away from the wound and this proliferation does not affect overall migration pattern. Whereas suprabasal keratinocytes are rather passive, basal keratinocytes move as a sheet of independently migrating cells into the wound, thereby constantly changing their direct neighboring cells enabling them to bypass intact obstacles. This re-epithelialization strategy results in a fast re-establishment of the protective skin barrier upon wounding.","Bornes, Laura; Windoffer, Reinhard; Leube, Rudolf E; Morgner, Jessica; van Rheenen, Jacco",Life science alliance,https://doi.org/10.26508/lsa.202000765; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33257474/,259
163155,Global Research Highlights,2021,"Background: Exercise likely has numerous, meaningful benefits for brain and cognition. However, those benefits and their causes remain imprecisely defined, especially in the context of cognitive disorders associated with aging, such as Alzheimer disease (AD). If the brain does benefit from exercise it does so primarily through exposure to brief, acute exposures to exercise over a lifetime. Methods: The Dementia Risk and Dynamic Response to Exercise (DYNAMIC) clinical trial seeks to characterize the acute exercise response in cerebral perfusion, and circulating neurotrophic factors in older adults with and without the apolipoprotein e4 genotype (APOE4), the strongest genetic predictor or sporadic, late onset AD. DYNAMIC will enroll 60 older adults into a single moderate intensity bout of exercise intervention. We will measure pre- and post-exercise cerebral blood flow using arterial spin labeling, and neurotrophic factors. We expect that APOE4 carriers will have poor CBF regulation, i.e. slower return to baseline perfusion after exercise, and will demonstrate blunted neurotrophic response to exercise, with concentrations of neurotrophic factors positively correlating with CBF regulation. If exercise-induced changes in perfusion and circulating factors can be detected, DYNAMIC will contribute to our understanding of exercise-induced brain change and potential biomarker outcomes of exercise interventions. Results: Preliminary proof-of-concept findings on 7 older adults and 9 younger adults. We have found that this experimental method can capture CBF and neurotrophic response over a time course, and best practices following exercise. Conclusions: This methodology will provide important insight into acute exercise response and potential directions for clinical trial outcomes. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04009629","White, D.; John, C.

One of their goals is to help the functional annotation of proteins and the prediction of protein-protein interactions. A correct aligner must preserve the network’s topology as well as the biological coherence. However, this is a trade-off that is hard to achieve. In addition, most aligners require a considerable effort to use in practice and many researchers must choose an aligner without the opportunity to previously compare the performance of different aligners.

We retrospectively analyzed COVID-19 related outcomes for hospitalized pts with SMs. Methods: We collected data on hospitalized pts with SMs and COVID-19 from 3/1/20 to Jan 1/1/21. Diagnosis COVID-19 was confirmed by RT-PCR of nasopharyngeal swabs. We assessed the association between the 30-day mortality and potential prognostic variables such as tumor types, cancer status, timing of treatment, types of anticancer therapy using logistic regression analyses. Results: A total of 246 hospitalized pts with SMs had COVID-19. Median age was 70 years, 87 (35%) were ≥75 years, 151 (61%) were female. The most common SMs were breast (56 [23%]), non-small cell lung (44 [18%]) and colon (31 [13%]). 154 (63%) pts were on active anticancer therapies. Of those 88 (35.5%) received treatment within 2 weeks, 16 (16.5%) within 4-12 weeks, 99 (39.9%) >3 months prior to COVID-19 diagnosis. 101 (65%) pts received cytotoxic chemotherapies, 26 (16.8%) received immune check point inhibitors (ICIs), 17 (11%) received targeted agents such as anti-EGFR therapy and 11 (7.1%) received monoclonal antibodies. Overall 30-day mortality was 42%, however, all pts with melanoma (7/7) died. The 30-day mortalities for pts who received anticancer treatments within 4 weeks, 4-12 weeks and >12 weeks of COVID-19 diagnosis were 47%, 50%, and 37%. For pts who never received treatment, 30-day mortality was 31%. For pts were in remission, stable disease and progressive disease, the 30-day mortalities were 32%, 35% and 62%. The 30-day mortalities for pts who received cytotoxic therapy, monoclonal antibodies, targeted therapies and ICIs, were 38%, 46%, 41% and 69%. Logistic regression analysis showed that pts who were >80 years of age (OR 3.6, 95% CI 1.6-8.1), had progressive disease (OR 3.4, 95% CI 1.8-6.5) or treated with ICIs (OR 3.6, 95% CI 1.5-8.7) were associated with higher 30-day mortality. Conclusions: COVID-19 associated 30-day mortality is high for hospitalized pts with SMs. Early surveillance of clinical deterioration could be helpful for hospitalized SMs pts with risk factors identified here. Further studies are needed to discern the observed association between ICIs use and worse COVID-19 outcome. (Table Presented).","Chi, J.; Chitty, D.; Kohn, N.; Shen, J.; Lopez, C.

Within this backdrop, our study aims to understand the effect of video games on Executive control (Visual Scanning and Visual Perception), Aggression, and Gaming Motivation. Twenty non-gamers were selected and divided into two groups: Action Video Game Players (AVGP) and Non-Action Video Game Players NAVGP). We used two computerized tests: Gabor Orientation Identification Test and Visual Scanning Test (to assess visual perception and visual scanning, respectively) and two questionnaires (to assess aggression and gaming motivation). We found an improvement in visual perception as well as visual scanning following video game training in AVGPs. Interestingly, aggression did not increase with an increase in video game exposure. We also found insignificant changes in gaming motivation after the training, except for self-gratification motives. Cognitive improvements do not relate to action video games alone, but non-action video games also show promising results to enhance cognition. With better timed and controlled training with video games, aggression as a prospective consequence of video game exposure can also be controlled. We propose targeted video game training as an approach to enhance cognition in non-gamers.","Dixit, Akshay; Sinha, Divya; Ramachandran, Hemalatha",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.15.456380,259

Results. Among the 920 patients admitted to the observatory, 139 (15 %) were severe and 653 (71 %) had a moderate condition. Fever was reported in 124 (13.5 %) patients at admission. Chest computed tomography (CT) was performed in 809 patients, with recent lung inflammation detected in 121 (15 %) cases. Twenty four (2.6 %) patients were revealed SARS-CoV-2-positive, with 20 diagnoses PCR-verified and four in chest CT. Ten patients were diagnosed positive in routine examination or at a specialty unit as fever aggravated. Thus, a two -staged SARS-CoV-2 screening with PCR and chest CT allowed an extra 2.6 % detection of COVID-19 cases despite negative tests at admission. Conclusion. The observatory management has reduced the likelihood of nosocomial COVID-19 and ensured a continued supply of specialty medical aid.","Gavrilina, O. A.; Vasileva, A. N.; Galstyan, G.

173260,Spectrum of hospitalized NeuroCOVID diagnoses from a tertiary care neurology centre in Eastern India,2021,"Background Universal access to assessment and treatment of mental health and learning disorders remains a significant and unmet need. There is a vast number of people without access to care because of economic, geographic, and cultural barriers as well as limited availability of clinical experts who could help advance our understanding of mental health. Objective To create an open, configurable software platform to build clinical measures, mobile assessments, tasks, and interventions without programming expertise. Specifically, our primary requirements include: an administrator interface for creating and scheduling recurring and customized questionnaires where end users receive and respond to scheduled notifications via an iOS or Android app on a mobile device. Such a platform would help relieve overwhelmed health systems, and empower remote and disadvantaged subgroups in need of accurate and effective information, assessment, and care. This platform has potential to advance scientific research by supporting the collection of data with instruments tailored to specific scientific questions from large, distributed, and diverse populations. Methods We conducted a search for tools that satisfy the above requirements. We designed and developed a new software platform called “MindLogger” that exceeds the above requirements. To demonstrate the tool’s configurability, we built multiple “applets” (collections of activities) within the MindLogger mobile application and deployed several, including a comprehensive set of assessments underway in a large-scale, longitudinal, mental health study. Results Of the hundreds of products we researched, we found 10 that met our primary requirements above with 4 that support end-to-end encryption, 2 that enable restricted access to individual users’ data, 1 that provides open source software, and none that satisfy all three. We compared features related to information presentation and data capture capabilities, privacy and security, and access to the product, code, and data. We successfully built MindLogger mobile and web applications, as well as web browser-based tools for building and editing new applets and for administering them to end users. MindLogger has end-to-end encryption, enables restricted access, is open source, and supports a variety of data collection features. One applet is currently collecting data from children and adolescents in our mental health study, and other applets are in different stages of testing and deployment for use in clinical and research settings. Conclusions We have demonstrated the flexibility and applicability of the MindLogger platform through its deployment in a large-scale, longitudinal, mobile mental health study, and by building a variety of other mental health-related applets. With this release, we encourage a broad range of users to apply the MindLogger platform to create and test applets to advance health care and scientific research. We hope that increasing availability of applets designed to assess and administer interventions will facilitate access to health care in the general population.","Klein, Arno; Clucas, Jon; Krishnakumar, Anirudh; Ghosh, Satrajit S.; Van Auken, Wil; Thonet, Benjamin; Sabram, Ihor; Acuna, Nino; Keshavan, Anisha; Rossiter, Henry; Xiao, Yao; Semenuta, Sergey; Badioli, Alessandra; Konishcheva, Kseniia; Abraham, Sanu Ann; Alexander, Lindsay M.; Merikangas, Kathleen R.; Swendsen, Joel; Lindner, Ariel B.; Milham, Michael P.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.16.385880,259
174029,An appraisal of respiratory system compliance in mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients,2021,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic impacted health care workers in many ways including mental health. This impact is usually underestimated in particular in developing countries. Objectives: The study aims to assess the level of anxiety, depression, risk perception, and coping strategies of Albanian healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic and to identify associated factors. Methods: A cross-sectional online study was conducted from April to May 2020 by recruiting health care personnel through the snowballing method. Data collection was carried out through social media using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) by Google forms. Participants were recruited from all health care sectors including doctors, nurses, etc. working in both the public and private sectors. Results: 410 questionnaires were included in the analysis. Most participants were nurses (59.3%), female (78.5%), and belonged to the age group 26–40 years (46.3%). Mild levels of anxiety were expressed in 26.9% of participants while 7.2% of them expressed moderate levels. 23.1% and 12.1% of participants expressed respectively mild and moderate depression levels. High levels of risk perception were found. A statistical association was found between occupation (p = 0.011), gender (p = 0.031), providing care for COVID-19 patients (p = 0.011), and the availably of mental health support in the workplace. Poor coping strategies were reported among participants. Conclusions: Mental health support should be a priority of the healthcare system in particular for young health care workers caring for COVID-19 patients. It can improve the mental health status of health care workers and their family members, impacting the quality of care provided.","Kamberi, F.; Sinaj, E.; Jaho, J.; Subashi, B.; Sinanaj, G.; Jaupaj, K.; Stramarko, Y.; Arapi, P.; Dine, L.; Gurguri, A.; Xhindoli, J.; Bucaj, J.; Serjanaj, L.

Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC), having been COVID-free for around two and a half months in the middle of the pandemic, is now facing a second wave of the infection after easing its preventive measures. Early implementation of precautions may dramatically reduce COVID-19 infections, but the virus is not eliminated. Additionally, the phenomenon ""pandemic fatigue"" introduced by the WHO is contributing to a significant decline in compliance with mitigation behaviors globally. With vaccines now rolling out, there is a reason to hope that there is an end in sight;however, it will most likely take a half year for widespread vaccinations to be in place.

Unlike re-ranking stages going through quick technique shifts during past decades, the first-stage retrieval has long been dominated by classical term-based models. Unfortunately, these models suffer from the vocabulary mismatch problem, which may block re-ranking stages from relevant documents at the very beginning. Therefore, it has been a long-term desire to build semantic models for the first-stage retrieval that can achieve high recall efficiently. Recently, we have witnessed an explosive growth of research interests on the first-stage semantic retrieval models. We believe it is the right time to survey current status, learn from existing methods, and gain some insights for future development. In this paper, we describe the current landscape of the first-stage retrieval models under a unified framework to clarify the connection between classical term-based retrieval methods, early semantic retrieval methods and neural semantic retrieval methods. Moreover, we identify some open challenges and envision some future directions, with the hope of inspiring more researches on these important yet less investigated topics.","Guo, Jiafeng; Cai, Yinqiong; Fan, Yixing; Sun, Fei; Zhang, Ruqing; Cheng, Xueqi",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.04831v4.pdf,259

To develop a global pandemic impact picture around agri-food and health systems. Cross-sectional web-based survey with closed- and open-ended questions. Food, nutrition, and health researchers/practitioners from an international network were recruited as representatives of populations they serve. Two reminders to complete the survey were sent. Groups vulnerable to food insecurity and government actions were mapped, along with the impact of the pandemic on food production, distribution, and access, and offer of nutrition services. Descriptive statistics and content analysis summarized the data. Thirty individuals from Africa, America, Asia, Oceania, and Europe responded (11.85%). Most were from nutrition and dietetics (43.3%) or medicine (26.7%), working in research (50%) and with &gt;10 years experience (62.1%). Informal/temporary workers (83.3%), older adults with chronic diseases (73.3%) and children eligible for school meals (53.3%) were found to be vulnerable to food insecurity. Commonly cited government actions were support for hand sanitation (53.3%), assistance to school-aged children (46.7%) and direct food provision (43.3%). About 50% saw community-led actions as important solutions. Only 16.7% mentioned remote delivery of nutrition services in primary care. Open-ended questions revealed that economic shocks, reduced investment, lack of staff/staff illnesses, transit restrictions, markets/stores closure or panic buying contributed to food production/distribution constraints. Reduced food availability, with unemployment/reduced purchasing power, increased food costs, lack of food security programmes or food emergency services contributed to food/nutrition insecurity. Nutrition services were reduced, suspended, or deprioritised. Several factors contributed to agri-food systems disruption and various government actions were implemented globally. Nutrition services offered in the healthcare context deserves further exploration. As the pandemic continue this provide a blueprint for a nutrition education/awareness programme to mitigate those risks based on knowledge gaps in policy and practice.

180233,Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) in ICU Patients during COVID-19: A Pilot Study,2021,"In 2020, health systems have been affected by the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, causing an influx of COVID-19 related visits and a sharp decline in non-emergency and elective visits. To mitigate the spread of COVID-19, healthcare systems - including the University of Virginia Health System - reduced ambulatory visits and implemented various social distancing measures, resulting in a drastic change in the patient admittance process. The focus of this work is to accurately characterize the effect of COVID-19 on one of the UVA Internal Medicine, Primary Care clinics, and where possible, to refine and optimize patient flow through the appointment process while accommodating public health restrictions. To achieve these goals, the team adopted a systems approach, which involves the iterative process of problem identification, analysis, and testing recommendations. The first phase of the project focused primarily on establishment of the current state and problem identification. The appointment process contains six major elements: scheduling, sign-in/remote registration, check-in, rooming, check-out, and telemedicine. Through extensive discussions with the clients, surveys of clinic staff, in-person observation, and data collection and analysis, the capstone team was able to understand the pandemic's impact on the clinic's patient flow and identify key problem areas at each stage in the appointment process. The team then used these insights to develop informed recommendations for these pain points. The second phase of the project consisted of formulating trials within UVA health restrictions and guidelines to test the impact of our recommendations. Through a pilot of a new remote registration process, on-time patients increased from 68% to 75%, nurse perceived workload decreased significantly, and the arrival process became more predictable. From this work, the team was able to develop a more generic framework for how health systems might assess and address patient flow issues under normal circumstances as well as during future pandemics. © 2021 IEEE.","Korte, E.; Laughlin, C.; Peters, T.; Stiles, L.; Riggs, R.; Dowdell, K.; Measells, K.","2021 IEEE Systems and Information Engineering Design Symposium, SIEDS 2021",https://doi.org/10.1109/sieds52267.2021.9483742,259

183060,The Potential Role of Super Spread Events in SARS-COV-2 Pandemic; a Narrative Review,2020-09-21,"We address the use of selfie ocular images captured with smartphones to estimate age and gender. Partial face occlusion has become an issue due to the mandatory use of face masks. Also, the use of mobile devices has exploded, with the pandemic further accelerating the migration to digital services. However, state‐of‐the‐art solutions in related tasks such as identity or expression recognition employ large Convolutional Neural Networks, whose use in mobile devices is infeasible due to hardware limitations and size restrictions of downloadable applications. To counteract this, we adapt two existing lightweight CNNs proposed in the context of the ImageNet Challenge, and two additional architectures proposed for mobile face recognition. Since datasets for soft‐biometrics prediction using selfie images are limited, we counteract over‐fitting by using networks pre‐trained on ImageNet. Furthermore, some networks are further pre‐trained for face recognition, for which very large training databases are available. Since both tasks employ similar input data, we hypothesise that such strategy can be beneficial for soft‐biometrics estimation. A comprehensive study of the effects of different pre‐training over the employed architectures is carried out, showing that, in most cases, a better accuracy is obtained after the networks have been fine‐tuned for face recognition.

Using a battery of assessments, we investigated the presence of latent profiles of personality traits in these two samples. We expected this analysis to shed further light onto the interplay between cultural factors and individual differences in decision making. Two samples consisting of individually matched (by age and sex) participants from Russia and Azerbaijan, N = 299 each, participated in the study. We utilized the following questionnaires: Questionnaire of Cognitive and Affective Empathy (QCAE), Personality Factors of Decision Making (LFR), Dirty Dozen. Latent profile analysis was performed separately for Russian and Azerbaijan samples in the VarSelLCM package for R. The results revealed two near-identical latent profiles in both samples. The two latent profiles differed primarily on the Dark Triad traits. Empathy did not act as a universal discriminating variable. Cultural specificity was found not for class composition but rather the discriminating power of individual variables.","Kornilova, T. V.; Kornilov, S.

This work investigates the potential impact of leveraging quantum computing technology for codon optimization. An adiabatic quantum computer (AQC) is compared to a standard genetic algorithm (GA) programmed with the same objective function. The AQC is found to be competitive in identifying optimal solutions and future generations of AQCs may be able to outperform classical GAs. The utility of gate-based systems is also evaluated using a simulator resulting in the finding that while current generations of devices lack the hardware requirements, in terms of both qubit count and connectivity, to solve realistic problems, future generation devices may be highly efficient.","Fox, Dillion M.; Branson, Kim M.; Walker, Ross C.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.19.431999,259

Refugee populations are particularly vulnerable to infectious disease outbreaks due to many population and environmental factors. A large measles outbreak, with over 2,500 cases, occurred among the Rohingya population between September and December 2017. Here, we estimate key epidemiological parameters and use a dynamic mathematical model of measles transmission to evaluate the effectiveness of the reactive vaccination campaigns in the refugee camps. We also estimate the potential for subsequent outbreaks under different vaccination coverage scenarios. Our modeling results highlight the success of the vaccination campaigns in rapidly curbing transmission and emphasize the public health importance of maintaining high levels of vaccination in this population, where high birth rates and historically low vaccination coverage rates create suitable conditions for future measles outbreaks.","Chin, Taylor; Buckee, Caroline O.; Mahmud, Ayesha S.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/19008417,259
184063,Reviewing lessons learnt of SARS in Singapore during planning for influenza pandemic.,2006,"Background In March 2020, the government of Scotland identified people deemed clinically extremely vulnerable to COVID due to their pre-existing health conditions. These people were advised to strictly self-isolate (shield) at the start of the pandemic, except for necessary healthcare. We examined who was identified as clinically extremely vulnerable, how their healthcare changed during isolation, and whether this process exacerbated healthcare inequalities. Methods We linked those on the shielding register in NHS Grampian, a health authority in Scotland, to healthcare records from 2015-2020. We described the source of identification, demographics, and clinical history of the cohort. We measured changes in out-patient, in-patient, and emergency healthcare during isolation in the shielding population and compared to the general non-shielding population. Results The register included 16,092 people (3% of the population), clinically vulnerable primarily due to a respiratory disease, immunosuppression, or cancer. Among them, 42% were not identified by national healthcare record screening but added ad hoc, with these additions including more children and fewer economically-deprived. During isolation, all forms of healthcare use decreased (25%-46%), with larger decreases in scheduled care than in emergency care. However, people shielding had better maintained scheduled care compared to the non-shielding general population: out-patient visits decreased 35% vs 49%; in-patient visits decreased 46% vs 81%. Notably, there was substantial variation in whose scheduled care was maintained during isolation: younger people and those with cancer had significantly higher visit rates, but there was no difference between sexes or socioeconomic levels. Conclusions Healthcare changed dramatically for the clinically extremely vulnerable population during the pandemic. The increased reliance on emergency care while isolating indicates that continuity of care for existing conditions was not optimal. However, compared to the general population, there was success in maintaining scheduled care, particularly in young people and those with cancer. We suggest that integrating demographic and primary care data would improve identification of the clinically vulnerable and could aid prioritising their care.","Butler, J.

In addition to the 4th lndustrial Revolution, it is necessary to mention the current topic, which is directly related to the concept of resilience and is, to some extent, behind its revival, i.e., COVID-19. Due to the COVID-19 crisis, the resilience topic is gaining prominence, and its importance is growing. The COVID-19 crisis shows how it has reduced the resilience of key systems to shocks and allowed failures to cascade from one system to others.

Historically, this has been modeled using the dominant positive-frequency (corotating) fundamental mode. Recently, there has been a renewed effort in modeling the post-merger waveform using higher, positive-frequency overtones in an attempt to achieve greater accuracy in describing the waveform at earlier times using linear perturbation theory. It has been shown that the inclusion of higher overtones can shift the linear regime to the peak of $(l,m)=(2,2)$ spherical harmonic mode. In this work, we show that the inclusion of negative-frequency (counterrotating) modes, called 'mirror' modes, extends the validity of linear perturbation theory to even earlier times, with far lower systematic uncertainties in the model in recovering the remnant parameters at these early times. A good description of the signal at early times also enables for a greater signal-to-noise ratio to be accumulated in the ringdown phase, thereby, allowing for a more accurate measurement of remnant parameters and tests of general relativity.","Dhani, Arnab",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.08602v2.pdf,259

This paper aims to examine the early strategic responses deployed by air-travel services players for navigating through the COVID-19 pandemic. Design/methodology/approach: Drawing on a qualitative case study and grounded theory methods, this research analyzes how DUBZ – a purposefully selected company operating in the air-travel services sector in the emirate of Dubai (UAE) – responded to the coronavirus disruption. Findings: Using this unique case as a basis for grounded theorizing, a framework was developed for understanding how air-travel service providers can effectively navigate through the crisis – the guard-potentiate-shape model. The advanced model suggests that in times of disruption, industry players should adopt several strategies to: guard against failure;potentiate innovative change;and shape the future design of air-travel services. An outcome of forward-looking shaping strategies that may define the new post-pandemic normal in the air-travel services sector constitutes the idea of “scattered/diffused airports” with a modified design of airport services architecture. Originality/value: The insights from the grounded theoretical framework contribute to both the empirical research on crisis management and the nascent literature on market-shaping strategies.

Given that cancer patients were excluded from serum anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) vaccine registration trials, it is still unknown whether they would develop a protective anti-spike antibody response following vaccination. This prospective vaccine monitoring study primarily aimed to assess humoral responses to SARS-CoV2 vaccine in thoracic cancer patients. Methods SARS-CoV2-spike antibodies were measured using Abbot ARCHITECT SARS-CoV-2 IgG immunoassay, prior to first injection of BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine, as well as at Week 4, and two-to-sixteen weeks after second vaccine dose. The factors associated with antibody response were analyzed. Results Overall, 306 patients, with a median age of 67.0 years (IQR=58-74), were vaccinated. Of these, 283 patients received two vaccine doses at 28-day intervals. After 4.7-month median follow-up, seven patients (2.3%) contracted proven symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, with rapid favorable evolution. Of 269 serological results available beyond Day 14 post-second vaccine dose, 17 (6.3%) were still negative (<50 AU/mL) (arbitrary units/mL), while 34 (11%) were <300 AU/mL (12.5th percentile). In multivariate analysis, only age and chronic corticosteroid treatment were significantly associated with a lack of immunization. Thirty patients received a third vaccine dose, with only three patients showing persistent negative serology thereafter, whereas the others demonstrated clear seroconversion. Conclusion SARS-CoV2 vaccines were shown to be efficient in thoracic cancer patients, most of them being immunized after two doses. A third shot given to 11% of patients with persistent low antibody titers resulted in a 88% immunization rate.","GOUNANT, V.; FERRE, V.

Objectives: The present study aimed to assess the opinions of Iranian population in specifying high-priority individuals and groups for COVID-19 vaccination. Methods: An online survey was conducted using some popular social media in Iran. The data was collected from Iranian population (878 individuals) aged 18 years and older during the COVID-19 pandemic (2-20 May 2020) to investigate their opinions towards vaccine allocation strategies at the family and society levels. In vaccine prioritizing within family three option and in vaccine prioritizing within society, seven population groups were introduced by the respondents in a random order, respectively. To analyze the data, mean rank and univariate analysis was used. Results: Healthcare workers, high-risk patients, and the elderly were the first priority groups for a vaccination with a mean rank of 2.8, 2.8, and 3.8, respectively. The least priority group was policymakers and executive managers (mean rank = 5.75). At the family level, 64% of the respondents introduced one of the family members as the first priority for vaccination, followed by their children (29%) and themselves (7%). No significant relationship was observed between respondents’ characteristics and their prioritization in vaccine prioritizing within society. Conclusions: Although involving public preference in decision-making is a key factor for the success of policies, careful design and implementation of vaccination programs through considering risk-benefit assessment is strongly recommended.","Moradi, N.; Heydari, S.

185716,The Potential Role of Super Spread Events in SARS-COV-2 Pandemic; a Narrative Review.,2020,"Background: Patients with severe COVID-19 seem to have a compromised antiviral response and hyperinflammation. Neutrophils are critical players in COVID-19 pathogenesis. IL-17A plays a major role in protection against extracellular pathogens and neutrophil attraction and activation. We hypothesized that secukinumab, an anti-IL17A monoclonal antibody, could mitigate the deleterious hyperinflammation in COVID-19. Methods: BISHOP was an open-label, single-center, phase-II controlled trial. Fifty adults hospitalized Covid-19 patients, confirmed by a positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR, were randomized 1:1 to receive 300mg of secukinumab subcutaneously at day-0 (group A) plus standard of care (SoC: antiviral drugs, antimicrobials, corticosteroids, and/or anticoagulants) or SoC alone (group B). A second dose of 300mg of secukinumab could be administered on day-7, according to staff judgment. The primary endpoint was ventilator-free days at day-28 (VFD-28). Secondary efficacy and safety outcomes were also explored. Findings: An intention-to-treat analysis showed no difference in VFD-28: 23.7 (95%CI 19.6-27.8) in group A vs. 23.8 (19.9-27.6) in group B, p=0.62; There was also no difference in hospitalization time, intensive care unit demand, the incidence of circulatory shock, acute kidney injury, fungal or bacterial co-infections, and severe adverse events. Pulmonary thromboembolism was less frequent in group A (4.2% vs. 26.2% p=0.04). There was one death in each group. Viral clearance, defined by the viral load fold change (2-{Delta}{Delta}CT) in upper airways, between day-0 and day-7, was also similar: 0.17 (0.05-0.56) in group A vs. 0.24 (0.10-0.57) in group B. Interpretation: The efficacy of secukinumab in the treatment of Covid19 was not demonstrated. No difference between groups in adverse events and no unexpected events were observed. Funding: Novartis Brazil supported this research providing expert input in the development of the project, drug supply, data management, and monitoring.","Resende, G. G.; Lage, R. d. C.; Lobe, S.

In this paper, we analyse and predict the future trend of the COVID-19 cases for the top ten countries with the highest number of confirmed cases to date and the top ten countries with the highest growth percentage within the last month. Since many recent works have proposed that the COVID-19 pattern follows an exponential distribution, we use a tuned approach to the Holt-Winters' additive method as a white-box model. Based on the analysis, we found that most of the countries are still presenting an increasing trend of confirmed cases in the near future. Apart from vaccine and drug development, measures such as vigilance, strategic governmental actions, public awareness, and social distancing are unarguably continuously needed to handle the spreading of COVID-19 and avoid or curb the next wave of the outbreak.","Seng, Hansun Vincent Charles Gherman Tatiana Subanar Christiana Rini Indrati",International Journal of Management &amp; Decision Making,https://doi.org/10.1504/ijmdm.2021.116018,259
185821,On-spot rheumatology consultations in a multilevel geriatric hospital.,2014,"The no-hair conjecture in General Relativity (GR) states that a Kerr black hole (BH) is completely described by its mass and spin. As a consequence, the complex quasi-normal-mode (QNM) frequencies of a binary-black-hole (BBH) ringdown can be uniquely determined by the mass and spin of the remnant object. Conversely, measurement of the QNM frequencies could be an independent test of the no-hair conjecture. This paper extends to spinning BHs earlier work that proposed to test the no-hair conjecture by measuring the complex QNM frequencies of a BBH ringdown using parameterized inspiral-merger-ringdown waveforms in the effective-one-body formalism, thereby taking full advantage of the entire signal power and removing dependency on the predicted or estimated start time of the ringdown. Our method was used to analyze the properties of the merger remnants for BBHs observed by LIGO-Virgo in the first half of their third observing (O3a) run. After testing our method with GR and non-GR synthetic-signal injections in Gaussian noise, we analyze, for the first time, two BBHs from the first (O1) and second (O2) LIGO-Virgo observing runs, and two additional BBHs from the O3a run. We then provide joint constraints with published results from the O3a run. In the most agnostic and conservative scenario where we combine the information from different events using a hierarchical approach, we obtain, at $90\%$ credibility, that the fractional deviations in the frequency (damping time) of the dominant QNM are $\delta f_{220}=0.03^{+0.10}_{-0.09}$ ($\delta \tau_{220}=0.10^{+0.44}_{-0.39}$), respectively, an improvement of a factor of $\sim 4$ ($\sim 2$) over the results obtained with our model in the LIGO-Virgo publication. The single-event most-stringent constraint to date continues to be GW150914 for which we obtain $\delta f_{220}=0.05^{+0.11}_{-0.07}$ and $\delta \tau_{220}=0.07^{+0.26}_{-0.23}$.","Ghosh, Abhirup; Brito, Richard; Buonanno, Alessandra",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.01906v2.pdf,259
185872,COVID-19 Immunity to Vaccination in India.,2021-01-01,"Since the world's first ATM was unveiled in London in 1967, the deployment of digital financial services has exploded. However, the issue of access for vulnerable groups such as elderly people, people with disabilities, financially less well off people and the unbanked, has never been fully addressed. Then, in 2020, the COVID-19 lockdown threw a glaring spotlight on accessibility. For millions of vulnerable people, a trip outdoors to make a financial transaction could have life-threatening consequences. Digital financial services were vital lifelines for millions in the lockdown, but those unable to access them were severely disadvantaged. Financial services providers, deluged with requests for help from customers unable to access digital services, were brought face to face with the problem of poor accessibility. That makes this an excellent time to ask: “What problems do vulnerable people face in accessing digital financial services and what can UK financial services providers do about them?” This paper addresses that issue, drawing on in-depth qualitative and quantitative research carried out in 2018–2019 and selectively updated in June 2020. Data, interviews with organisations representing vulnerable people, and comments from vulnerable people themselves, provide a picture of the access problems that they face. The main finding is that financial services institutions still have insufficient knowledge about accessible systems and processes, and about user-demand for them. More work is expeditiously needed. This paper aims to help inform that work, so that financial services providers can offer services that turn a problem into an opportunity for both vulnerable people and service providers. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Gill, W.; Sukhvinder, H.; Linda, W.",Advanced Sciences and Technologies for Security Applications,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-72120-6_3,259

The experiments revealed that the viruses are incorporated into the cells by viropexis within 1 hour after being added to the culture. An increasing number of particles are found later inside dense cytoplasmic corpuscles similar to lysosomes. In the cytoplasm of the cells from the samples taken 7 hours after inoculation, two organized structures generally associated and never seen in the controls are observed: one consists of dense material arranged in a reticular disposition (reticular inclusion); the other is formed by small tubules organized in a complex pattern (tubular body). No evidence has been found concerning their origin. Their significance is discussed. With the progression of the infection a system of membrane-bounded tubules and cisternae is differentiated in the cytoplasm of the ML cells. In the lumen of these tubules or cisternae, which are occupied by a dense material, numerous virus particles are observed. The virus particles which originate in association with the limiting membranes of tubules and cisternae are released into their lumen by a ""budding"" process. The virus particles are 75 mµ in diameter and possess a nucleoid constituted of dense particles or rods limiting an electron transparent core. The virus limiting membrane is sometimes covered by an outer layer of a dense material. In the cells from the samples taken 14 to 20 hours after inoculation, larger zones of the cell cytoplasm are occupied by inclusion bodies formed by channels or cisternae with their lumens containing numerous virus particles. In the samples taken 20 hours or more after the inoculation numerous cells show evident signs of degeneration.","David-Ferreira, J. F.; Manaker, R.

After a year, the mortality rate was approximately 10%, and by 2 years, it had increased to nearly 30%. Clinical signs and urinary tract pathology were examined as a function of diet, duration on diet, gender, methylmercury exposure, genetics, and other potential risk factors by using survival analyses and qualitative comparisons. Urolithiasis in female rats appeared 15 weeks after beginning a purified diet and after 5 weeks for male rats. After 97 weeks, the mortality rate of female rats was 22% and for male rats was 64%. Lifetime urolithiasis-associated mortality was about 2% in a group of rats that consumed the contaminated diet for < 30 weeks. No urolithiasis occurred in siblings or cohorts of the rats described here that were maintained on a standard rodent chow containing choline chloride. Urolithiasis was traced to racemic, rather than levo-, bitartaric acid in some purified diets shipped in 2001 and 2002. It is unknown when the impurity first appeared in the diet, so estimates of exposure duration are upper limits. Chronic methylmercury exposure increased vulnerability. Some families (dam + offspring) had multiple cases of urolithiasis, but probability models constructed to evaluate familial clustering revealed no evidence for a genetic predisposition to urolithiasis apart from gender. Removing racemic tartaric acid did not decrease mortality once rats had been on the diet for 20 to 30 weeks, but it helped when exposure duration was shorter.","Newland, M Christopher; Reile, Phyllis A; Sartin, Eva A; Hart, Michael; Craig-Schmidt, Margaret C; Mandel, Ian; Mandel, Neil",Comparative medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16158911/,259

Many patients are attempting to balance health and financial stability. Therefore, we sought to determine how physicians who frequently prescribe immunosuppressive medications are counselling patients on return-to-work prior to widespread vaccine distribution and understand their decision processes. METHODS We administered a survey through the Canadian Rheumatology, Gastroenterology and Dermatology Associations. Physicians were asked whether patients have requested counselling on return-to-work during the pandemic and how they decide what advice to provide. They were shown seven clinical scenarios of patients on immunosuppressive medications, then asked whether they would provide a medical note advocating for delayed return-to-work or modified duties to reduce exposure. RESULTS 151 physicians took the survey. 94% were asked for advice on return-to-work. 33% felt informed enough to provide counselling. When patients requested a medical note, physicians provided one 25% of the time. Factors most associated with providing notes were patient comorbidities, age, glucocorticoids, high risk work and vulnerable co-inhabitants. Conventional synthetic and biologic immunosuppressants did not prompt most physicians to provide a note. Respondents considered patient perspectives and workplace factors. Several requested guidelines to approach these encounters. CONCLUSIONS Almost all rheumatologists, dermatologists and gastroenterologists have been asked to counsel patients on returning to work during the COVID-19 pandemic. Most do not feel informed enough to do so. Medical notes for accommodations are only provided a minority of the time, unless specific factors (e.g. glucocorticoids) are present. Guidance is needed to inform these decisions.","Ladak, Karim; Winthrop, Kevin; Marshall, John K; Gelfand, Joel; Pope, Janet",Clinical and experimental rheumatology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33822707/,259

We aimed to measure lung compliance and examine other factors associated with mortality in COVID-19 patients with ARDS. METHODS Adult patients with COVID-19 ARDS who required invasive mechanical ventilation at 8 hospitals in Singapore were prospectively enrolled. Factors associated with both mortality and differences between high (<40mL/cm H2O) and low (<40mL/cm H2O) compliance were analysed. RESULTS A total of 102 patients with COVID-19 who required invasive mechanical ventilation were analysed; 15 (14.7%) did not survive. Non-survivors were older (median 70 years, interquartile range [IQR] 67-75 versus median 61 years, IQR 52-66; P<0.01), and required a longer duration of ventilation (26 days, IQR 12-27 vs 8 days, IQR 5-15; P<0.01) and intensive care unit support (26 days, IQR 11-30 vs 11.5 days, IQR 7-17.3; P=0.01), with a higher incidence of acute kidney injury (15 patients [100%] vs 40 patients [46%]; P<0.01). There were 67 patients who had lung compliance data; 24 (35.8%) were classified as having high compliance and 43 (64.2%) as having low compliance.

191957,Morbidity Among Home Isolated COVID-19 Patients.,2021-02-01,"PURPOSE Retinal inflammatory and degenerative processes in humans and animals frequently are associated with genetic factors. The murine coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), JHM strain, induces a biphasic retinal disease in adult BALB/c mice. The genetic constitution of the host and the virus serotype can be critical factors in determining the outcome of a virus infection. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the possible role of host genetics in murine coronavirus-induced retinal disease. METHODS JHM virus was inoculated by the intravitreal route into BALB/c, CD-1, and A/J mice. At varying times after inoculation, eye tissues were evaluated histologically. Antibody responses to the virus were evaluated by neutralization assays. RESULTS JHM virus induces a biphasic retinal disease in BALB/c mice. In the early phase, 1 to 7 days after inoculation, retinal vasculitis is observed. The second phase, characterized by retinal degeneration in the absence of inflammation, is seen by day 10 and progresses for several months. There is a similar biphasic disease process in JHM virus-infected A/J mice. However, retinal changes are less severe than those seen in BALB/c mice. Retinal tissue damage induced by JHM virus in CD-1 mice is different. Only the early phase of the disease, consisting of retinal vasculitis, was observed. These CD-1 mice do not develop the retinal degenerative disease. In fact, after day 10, the retina has a normal appearance. These differences in retinal tissue damage are seen over a wide range of infectivity of the virus inocula. Virus concentrations ranging from 10(1.4) to 10(4.4) TCID50/5 microliters were capable of inducing both inflammation and degeneration in BALB/c mice, whereas, the highest concentration of virus (10(4.4) TCID50/5 microliters) in CD-1 mice resulted in only the early inflammatory changes. CONCLUSIONS The authors show that the genetics of the host can profoundly affect the nature of retinal tissue damage. These studies substantiate the concept that a virus can indeed trigger retinal degenerative processes in genetically susceptible hosts.","Wang, Y; Burnier, M; Detrick, B; Hooks, J J",Investigative ophthalmology & visual science,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8550331/,259

Opportunistic airborne transmission may occur when conducting highrisk aerosol generating procedures and airborne precautions will be required in this setting.

192633,Post COVID-19 Mucormycosis - from the Frying Pan into the Fire.,2021-01-01,"OBJECTIVE Because of the widespread availability of rapid viral antigen testing, many institutions never adopted a routine practice of ordering viral cultures to detect community-acquired respiratory viruses (CRVs). The ease of performing complete viral studies in our on site laboratory allowed us to assess the clinical implications of the absence of conventional culture results in previously healthy hospitalized children with CRV infections. METHODS From June 1997 through May 2000, the results of direct immunofluorescence assay (DFA) of 1069 nasopharyngeal swab (NP) specimens were compared with simultaneously inoculated conventional tube cell cultures for detection of CRVs. In addition the medical records of 140 previously healthy infants and children hospitalized for management of lower respiratory tract infections caused by culture-proved CRVs were reviewed. RESULTS Viruses were isolated or detected by DFA or viral culture or both in 468 (30%) of the 1557 NP samples evaluated. The most common CRV isolated was respiratory syncytial virus (49%), followed by parainfluenza viruses (15%), influenza A viruses (14%), rhinoviruses (8%), adenoviruses (4%), enteroviruses (4%) and influenza B viruses (1%). Of the 1069 NP specimens for which both viral culture and rapid antigen testing were performed, 190 specimens were DFA-positive and culture-positive, 7 specimens were DFA-positive and culture-negative, 35 specimens were DFA-negative and culture-positive and 837 specimens were DFA-negative and culture-negative. The overall sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of DFA were 84, 99, 96 and 96%, respectively. Of the 140 hospitalized patients with culture-proved viral cultures (89 respiratory syncytial virus, 22 influenza A, 20 parainfluenza virus and 9 adenovirus), the mean duration of hospital stay was 3.6 days, and the mean time for viral cultures to become positive was 7.7 days (P < 0.001, signed rank test). One hundred twenty (86%) viral cultures did not become positive until after the patient had been discharged from the hospital. In no case was the clinical decision regarding the patient's treatment or discharge from the hospital based on the results of viral culture. CONCLUSIONS We conclude that positive viral cultures have no impact on clinical decision making and management of healthy children during hospitalization for illness attributable to community-acquired respiratory viruses.","Shetty, Avinash K; Treynor, Elizabeth; Hill, David W; Gutierrez, Kathleen M; Warford, Ann; Baron, Ellen Jo",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14506369/,259
192664,COVID-19 and Mucormycosis: Time we Answer Questions?,2021-07-01,"Airway hyperresponsiveness is the most prominent functional abnormality in asthma. Although its aetiology is still unclear, it is well-known that allergen exposure and virus infections can temporarily induce or aggravate airway hyperresponsiveness. Among these environmental factors, virus infections appear to be clinically most relevant, since recent epidemiological studies have shown that most asthma exacerbations in children are associated with positive nasopharyngeal viral identification. The pathogenesis of virus-induced airway hyperresponsiveness has been investigated by experimental virus infections in animals and in man. Intranasal inoculation and/or inhalation of live attenuated influenza virus, or certain strains of rhinovirus, have been shown to induce airway hyperresponsiveness to various bronchoconstrictor stimuli in man. This indicates that experimental virus-infection, like allergen challenge, is an appropriate investigational model of asthma. The mechanisms of virus-induced airway hyperresponsiveness are still unclear, but may, in part, be similar to those involved in the pathogenesis of asthma. Currently investigated hypothesis include: epithelial damage or dysfunction, immunological responses, inflammatory mediator release, cholinergic and/or noncholinergic reflexes, and impaired beta-adrenoceptor function. Careful experimental studies, using modern laboratory techniques, are needed to unravel the role of viruses in the development of airway hyperresponsiveness. The results of such studies can potentially lead to an improvement of future asthma management.","Sterk, P J",The European respiratory journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8393410/,259
192725,"Clinico-radiological Presentation of COVID-19 Patients at a Tertiary Care Center at Bhilwara Rajasthan, India.",2020-07-01,"INTRODUCTION Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a hepatotropic virus causing a variety of extrahepatic immunological manifestations and is a risk factor of a variety of extrahepatic diseases, such as mixed cryoglobulinemia and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN), which is the most common glomerulonephritis. The aim of this study was to evaluate renal involvement in HCV-infected patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 300 randomly-selected HCV antibody-positive outpatients at the HCV clinic of Shariati hospital were enrolled. Serum creatinine was measured and glomerular filtration rate was estimated accordingly. Urine proteinuria was measured in 24-hour urine samples. RESULTS The patients were 249 men (83.2%) and 51 women (16.8%) with a mean age of 37.8 +/- 11.7 years (range, 18 to 70 years). Proteinuria was found in 12 HCV antibody-positive adults (4%), 1 of whom underwent biopsy. He was a 55- year-old man with a 4-month history of facial and lower extremities edema and 3-g proteinuria with a normal kidney function (glomerular filtration rate, 85 mL/min) and normocomplementemia. Kidney biopsy specimens showed MPGN. The frequency of low glomerular filtration rate was 0.7% (2 patients) in the HCV antibody-positive adults. There was no significant relationship between HCV seropositivity and low glomerular filtration rate. CONCLUSIONS Our observations showed renal involvement in HCV antibody-positive patients. Among immune complex glomerular kidney diseases, MPGN without cryoglobulins is thought to be the most common in these patients.","Saddadi, Fereshteh; Attari, Fatemeh; Najafi, Iraj; Gangi, Mohammad Reza; Hakemi, Monirsadat; Amini, Manochehr",Iranian journal of kidney diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20404422/,259

193257,Urogynecologic conditions: chronic pelvic pain.,2015,"Clostridium difficile colitis is a major complication of antibiotic therapy. Antibiotics cause a reduction in bacteria that normally reside in the colon. If an antibiotic-treated patient ingests C. difficile bacteria, this organism may proliferate in the colon because it is resistant to most antibiotics and because it does not have to compete with the normal bacteria for nutrients. If the C. difficile organism has the gene for toxin production, the toxin can produce a colitis. In addition to antibiotics, other proposed risk factors for development of C. difficile colitis include advanced age, contact with infected patients and with their health care providers, impaired immune function, suppression of gastric acid secretion by a proton pump inhibitor, and postpyloric tube feeding. Many of the risk factors become simultaneously focused on patients admitted to the hospital. The incidence of C. difficile disease has been rising, and strains have become more virulent. In some forms of the disease, the patient doesn't have diarrhea, and in such patients C. difficile can be deadly but difficult to diagnose. The standard treatment, with metronidazole or vancomycin, fails to work in up to 25% of patients with the fulminant form of colitis. Since C. difficile causes only 20% of cases of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, a specific test is needed to diagnose this organism. Toxigenic cultureis highly specific but not available at most institutions. The tests that are available--enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and fecal cytotoxicity assay--have high false-negative rates, even in patients with severe clinical disease, creating a diagnostic dilemma. The only proven way to reduce the risk of C. difficile disease is implementation of an antibiotic management program in conjunction with enhanced infection control procedures.","Fordtran, John S",Proceedings,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16424922/,259

We present a case with a patient treated for severe Covid-19 infection. She was intubated for 16 days and was ventilated in the prone-position for several hours a day during her care in the intensive care unit (ICU). She developed paralysis of the left facial nerve, observed while intubated. After extubation the patient was hoarse and had dysphagia and examination showed paralysis of the left hypoglossal nerve with the tongue deviating to the left and of the left vagus nerve causing a paralysis of the left vocal cord. It is impossible to know whether the paralysis of the three cranial nerves was due to direct damage by the Covid-19 virus or due to compression of the nerves during the ICU care. As facial nerve palsy has been shown to be more common in patients with Covid-19, we believe that the paralysis in our patient was due to a combination of both.","Engström, Kristina; Saber, Amanj",Lakartidningen,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34228809/,259

However, its use is often constrained by the instability of infectious clone constructs during propagation in E. coli. To circumvent this problem, we have devised a strategy that could be suitable for design of +RNA virus molecular clones in general. An infectious clone is assembled as ""infectious DNA,"" and expression of problem regions present in the viral cDNA is prevented during propagation in E. coli by insertion of short introns. To demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, a highly unstable Japanese encephalitis flavivirus infectious clone has been successfully converted into a remarkably stable infectious DNA construct with the specific infectivity of 10(6) pfu/microg in cell culture. The proposed strategy may be useful in the design of self-amplifying gene therapy vectors and development of new immunization methodologies, and could facilitate creation of molecular repositories of existing viral vaccines.","Yamshchikov, V; Mishin, V; Cominelli, F",Virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11277699/,259

197931,"COVID 19 in India: Waves, Variants of Concern, Airborne Transmission.",2021-05-01,"Respiratory RNA viruses responsible for the common cold often worsen airway inflammation and bronchial responsiveness, two characteristic features of human asthma. We studied the effects of dsRNA, a nucleotide synthesized during viral replication, on airway inflammation and bronchial hyperresponsiveness in murine models of asthma. Intratracheal instillation of poly I:C, a synthetic dsRNA, increased the airway eosinophilia and enhanced bronchial hyperresponsiveness to methacholine in OVA-sensitized, exposed rats. These changes were associated with induction of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression and COX-2-dependent PGD2 synthesis in the lungs, particularly in alveolar macrophages. The direct intratracheal instillation of PGD2 enhanced the eosinophilic inflammation in OVA-exposed animals, whereas pretreatment with a dual antagonist against the PGD2 receptor-(CRTH2) and the thromboxane A2 receptor, but not with a thromboxane A2 receptor-specific antagonist, nearly completely eliminated the dsRNA-induced worsening of airway inflammation and bronchial hyperresponsiveness. CRTH2-deficient mice had the same degree of allergen-induced airway eosinophilia as wild-type mice, but they did not exhibit a dsRNA-induced increase in eosinophil accumulation. Our data demonstrate that COX-2-dependent production of PGD2 followed by eosinophil recruitment into the airways via a CRTH2 receptor are the major pathogenetic factors responsible for the dsRNA-induced enhancement of airway inflammation and responsiveness.","Shiraishi, Yoshiki; Asano, Koichiro; Niimi, Kyoko; Fukunaga, Koichi; Wakaki, Misa; Kagyo, Junko; Takihara, Takahisa; Ueda, Soichiro; Nakajima, Takeshi; Oguma, Tsuyoshi; Suzuki, Yusuke; Shiomi, Tetsuya; Sayama, Koichi; Kagawa, Shizuko; Ikeda, Eiji; Hirai, Hiroyuki; Nagata, Kinya; Nakamura, Masataka; Miyasho, Taku; Ishizaka, Akitoshi",Journal of immunology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18097056/,259

This review describes the pathophysiology of the condition and provides a practical approach to the evaluation and treatment of adults with uncomplicated acute bronchitis. Practical points to be made are:1. Respiratory viruses appear to cause the large majority of cases of uncomplicated acute bronchitis.2. Pertussis infection is present in up to 10% to 20% of adults with cough illness of more than 2 to 3 weeks' duration. No clinical features distinguish pertussis from nonpertussis infection in adults who were immunized against pertussis as children.3. Transient bronchial hyperresponsiveness appears to be the predominant mechanism of the bothersome cough of acute bronchitis.4. Ruling out pneumonia is the primary objective in evaluating adults with acute cough illness in whom comorbid conditions and occult asthma are absent or unlikely. In the absence of abnormalities in vital signs (heart rate > 100 beats/min, respiratory rate > 24 breaths/min, and oral body temperature > 38 degrees C), the likelihood of pneumonia is very low.5. Randomized, placebo-controlled trials do not support routine antibiotic treatment of uncomplicated acute bronchitis.6. Randomized, placebo-controlled trials have shown that inhaled albuterol decreases the duration of cough in adults with uncomplicated acute bronchitis.7. Intervention studies suggest that antibiotic treatment of acute bronchitis can be reduced by using a combination of patient and physician education. Decreased rates of antibiotic treatment are not associated with increased utilization, return visits, or dissatisfaction with care.","Gonzales, R; Sande, M A",Annals of internal medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11119400/,259

198525,Role of Mycobacterium w for the Treatment of COVID-19: An Observational Study.,2021-01-01,"BACKGROUND Burnout has been a commonly discussed issue for the past ten years among physicians and other health care workers. A survey of interventional pain physicians published in 2016 reported high levels of emotional exhaustion, often considered the most taxing aspect of burnout. Job dissatisfaction appeared to be the leading agent in the development of burnout in pain medicine physicians in the United States. The COVID-19 pandemic has drastically affected the entire health care workforce and interventional pain management, with other surgical specialties, has been affected significantly. The COVID-19 pandemic has placed several physical and emotional stressors on interventional pain management physicians and this may lead to increased physician burnout. OBJECTIVE To assess the presence of burnout specific to COVID-19 pandemic among practicing interventional pain physicians. METHODS American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) administered a 32 question survey to their members by contacting them via commercially available online marketing company platform. The survey was completed on www.constantcontact.com. RESULTS Of 179 surveys sent, 100 responses were obtained. The data from the survey demonstrated that 98% of physician practices were affected by COVID and 91% of physicians felt it had a significant financial impact. Sixty seven percent of the physicians responded that in-house billing was responsible for their increased level of burnout, whereas 73% responded that electronic medical records (EMRs) were one of the causes. Overall, 78% were very concerned. Almost all respondents have been affected with a reduction in interventional procedures. 60% had a negative opinion about the future of their practice, whereas 66% were negative about the entire health care industry. LIMITATIONS The survey included only a small number of member physicians. Consequently, it may not be generalized for other specialties or even pain medicine. However, it does represent the sentiment and present status of interventional pain management. CONCLUSION The COVID-19 pandemic has put interventional pain practices throughout the United States under considerable financial and psychological stress. It is essential to quantify the extent of economic loss, offer strategies to actively manage provider practice/wellbeing, and minimize risk to personnel to keep patients safe.","Jha, Sachin Sunny; Shah, Shalini; Calderon, Michael David; Soin, Amol; Manchikanti, Laxmaiah",Pain physician,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32942787/,259

PATIENTS AND METHODS Eleven consecutive patients (nine men and two women) with a total of 36 inoperable ICCs (18 initial lesions, 16 lesions newly detected during follow-up, and two local recurrences) underwent SRFA between December 2004 and June 2010. Two different radiofrequency ablation (RFA) devices with internally cooled electrodes were used. Tumor diameters ranged from 0.5 to 10 cm (median 3.0 cm). A total of 23 SRFA sessions were performed. The efficacy of SRFA was evaluated by contrast-enhanced computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging 1 month after treatment and then every 3 months. RESULTS Primary technical effectiveness rate was 92%. Further follow-up every 3 months revealed three local recurrences (8%), two of which were successfully retreated, resulting in a secondary technical effectiveness rate of 98%. After a total of 23 RFA sessions, three major complications occurred (13%) that could be managed interventionally. Mean follow-up time was 35 months (range 12-81 months). One- and 3-year overall survival rates were 91 and 71%, respectively. The median overall survival was 60 months (according to the life table method). Eight (73%) of 11 patients were still alive at the end of follow-up. CONCLUSION SRFA is effective in the treatment of unresectable ICC even if the tumor is large and located close to major vessels. SRFA shows a survival benefit compared to other palliative treatment options and may also be considered as the first-line local treatment of ICCs in selected patients.","Haidu, Marion; Dobrozemsky, Georg; Schullian, Peter; Widmann, Gerlig; Klaus, Alexander; Weiss, Helmut; Margreiter, Raimund; Bale, Reto",Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22006031/,259

This paper aims to study whether elderly people with dementia are able to participate in legal contracts like sales, purchases, loans, leases, donations and testaments. We tried to introduce a new test for the above legal-financial contracts and show some preliminary findings. The test consists of six examined relevant domains concerning basic monetary skills, cash transactions, bank statement management, financial conceptual knowledge, knowledge of potential heirs (beneficiaries) and assets/estate and finally the decision making process for different dilemmas on sales, purchases, loans, leases, donations and testaments. We studied 203 people. Eighty three people were healthy, 64 with Alzheimer's disease (AD) (10 with severe AD, 22 with moderate, and 32 with mild AD), 10 with Parkinson's disease (PD), and 46 with amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment (aMCI). Individuals were included in the study only if they were aged 60 and over and only if they had a partner or a guardian who could give information on the individual's daily living. The exclusion criteria were predefined as follows: history of any other mental health disease and/or any other serious somatic health disease except for their official diagnosis of dementia. Results showed statistically significant differences with all three groups of patients characterized as incapable for legal-financial actions. Patients with severe AD (P<0.001), patients with moderate AD (P<0.001), patients with mild AD (P<0.001), patients with PD (P<0.001) and aMCI patients (P<0.001) differed significantly from healthy controls. Further research should include more extensive sampling of elderly patients with varying demographic characteristics in Greece, to confirm and expand our initial findings. In conclusion, our new test which is based on Marson's theoretical model of financial capacity seems to be highly correlated with the so far use of MMSE/HMSE scores, but it gives more specific information that is of interest in the field of civil forensics for characterizing someone as legally (in) capable for large and/or small scale financial acts.

206262,COVID Philately Part-III,2021,"In this single-center, retrospective cohort analysis of hospitalized coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, we investigate whether inflammatory biomarker levels predict respiratory decline in patients who initially present with stable disease. Examination of C-reactive protein (CRP) trends reveals that a rapid rise in CRP levels precedes respiratory deterioration and intubation, although CRP levels plateau in patients who remain stable. Increasing CRP during the first 48 h of hospitalization is a better predictor (with higher sensitivity) of respiratory decline than initial CRP levels or ROX indices (a physiological score of respiratory function). CRP, the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6), and physiological measures of hypoxemic respiratory failure are correlated, which suggests a mechanistic link. Our work shows that rising CRP predicts subsequent respiratory deterioration in COVID-19 and may suggest mechanistic insight and a potential role for targeted immunomodulation in a subset of patients early during hospitalization.","Mueller, Alisa A; Tamura, Tomoyoshi; Crowley, Conor P; DeGrado, Jeremy R; Haider, Hibah; Jezmir, Julia L; Keras, Gregory; Penn, Erin H; Massaro, Anthony F; Kim, Edy Y",Cell Rep Med,,259

This information can help guide the management of pregnant women with COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: Examine risk factors for severe COVID-19 in pregnant women. METHODS: We reviewed the records of all pregnant women with positive SARS-CoV2 tests (qRT-PCR) managed at a single tertiary private maternity in Sao Paulo, Brazil. We categorized women as having non-severe (mild or moderate) or severe (severe or critical) COVID-19. We conducted multivariable analyses to identify differences in sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of the two groups as risk factors for severe COVID-19. RESULTS: Between March 13 and June 7 2020, 114 women tested positive for SARS-CoV-2; 80.7% (n = 92) had non-severe disease (69 mild, 23 moderate), 15.7% (n = 18) had severe, and 3.5% (n = 4) had critical COVID-19. Women with severe/critical COVID-19 (n = 22) were significantly older (35.0 ± 5.9 × 31.8 ± 5.1 years, p = 0.011), more likely to have at least one medical comorbidity (81.8% × 52.2%, p = .011) or a history of asthma (18.2% × 3.3%, p = .025), and tended to have a higher median body mass index (30.1 kg/m2, IQR 28.1-33.9 × 28.6, IQR 26.2-32.0, p = .056) than women with non-severe disease. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified four factors as independent predictors of severe/critical COVID-19: asthma (OR 34.469, 95% CI 1.151-78.030, p = .026), non-white ethnicity (OR 7.932, 95% CI 1.311-47.973, p = .024), maternal age with a best cutoff of &#8805; 34 years (OR 1.195, 95% CI 1.001-1.427, p = .048) and gestational age at diagnosis with a best cut-off of &#8805; 35 weeks (OR 0.876, 95% CI 0.780-0.983, p = .025). The predictive value of the model including all variables was 0.823 (p < .001). CONCLUSION: A history of asthma, non-white ethnicity, and older maternal age were risk factors for, while higher gestational age was protective against severe/critical COVID-19 in pregnant Brazilian women.","Tutiya, Celso; Mello, Filomena; Chaccur, Gilberto; Almeida, Camila; Galvão, Elaine; Barbosa de Souza, Andressa Cristina; Kondo, Mario Macoto; Torloni, Maria Regina; Siaulys, Monica",J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med,,259

METHODS: A survey was conducted over the course of 5 days (from April 21 to 25, 2020), targeting all adult ID specialists currently in the medical field in South Korea (n = 265). An online-based survey was forwarded via text message and e-mail. Only one response was accepted from each participant. RESULTS: Of these 265 ID specialists gotten to, 132 (49.8%) responded. The highest proportion of the respondents envisaged the current COVID-19 outbreak to end after December 2020 (47.7% for the domestic Korean outbreak and 70.5% for the global pandemic); moreover, 60.7% of them stated that a second nationwide wave is likely to occur between September and December 2020 in South Korea. N95 respirators were considered to be the most important item in hospitals in preparation for a second wave. The most important policy to be implemented at the national level was securing national hospitals designated for the treatment of ID (67.4%). CONCLUSION: ID experts in South Korea believe that the COVID-19 pandemic may not be easily controlled and that a second nationwide wave is likely to occur in South Korea. Our results indicate that Korean ID specialists believe that a high level of preparation is needed in various aspects, including the procurement of personal protective equipment, to respond efficiently to a second outbreak.","Kim, Bongyoung; Park, Se Yoon; Jung, Dong Sik; Jung, Sook In; Oh, Won Sup; Kim, Shin-Woo; Peck, Kyong Ran; Chang, Hyun-Ha",Korean J Intern Med,,259

In this work, we introduce a new virucidal face mask concept based on a reverse-flow reactor driven by the oscillatory flow of human breath. The governing heat and mass transport equation are formulated and solved to analyze designs that evaluate both viral and CO2 transport during inhalation and exhalation. Given limits imposed by the volume and frequency of human breath, the kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 thermal inactivation, and human safety and comfort, heated masks may inactivate SARS-CoV-2 in inflow and outflow to medical grade sterility. We detail one particular design, with a volume of 300 mL at 90 $^\circ$C, that achieves a 3-log reduction in viral load with minimal viral impedance within the mask mesh, with partition coefficient around 2. This study is the first quantitative analysis of virucidal thermal inactivation within a protective face mask and addresses a pressing need for new approaches for personal protective equipment during a global pandemic.","Faucher, Samuel; Lundberg, Daniel James; Liang, Xinyao Anna; Jin, Xiaojia; Phillips, Rosalie; Parviz, Dorsa; Buongiorno, Jacopo; Strano, Michael S.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.11336v1.pdf,259
213133,Temperature screening has negligible value for control of COVID-19,2020,"UVB in sunlight, 290-315 nm, can inactivate SARS CoV and SARS CoV-2 viruses on surfaces and in the air. Laboratory exposure to ultraviolet irradiance in the UVC range inactivates many viruses and bacteria in times less than 30 min. Estimated UVB inactivation doses from sunlight in J/m2 are obtained from UVC measurements and radiative transfer calculations, weighted by a virus inactivation action spectrum, using OMI satellite atmospheric data for ozone, clouds, and aerosols. For SARS CoV, using an assumed UVC dose near the mid-range of measured values, D 90 = 40 J/m2, 90% inactivation times T 90 are estimated for exposure to midday 10:00-14:00 direct plus diffuse sunlight and for nearby locations in the shade (diffuse UVB only). For the assumed D 90 = 40 J/m2 model applicable to SARS CoV viruses, calculated estimates show that near noon 11:00-13:00 clear-sky direct sunlight gives values of T 90 < 90 min for mid-latitude sites between March and September and less than 60 min for many equatorial sites for 12 months of the year. Recent direct measurements of UVB sunlight inactivation of the SARS CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19 show shorter T 90 inactivation times less than 10 min depending on latitude, season, and hour. The equivalent UVC 254 nm D 90 dose for SARS CoV-2 is estimated as 3.2 ± 0.7 J/m2 for viruses on a steel mesh surface and 6.5 ± 1.4 J/m2 for viruses in a growth medium. For SARS CoV-2 clear-sky T 90 on a surface ranges from 4 min in the equatorial zone to less than 30 min in a geographic area forming a near circle with solar zenith angle < 60O centered on the subsolar point for local solar times from 09:00 to 15:00 h.","Herman, Jay; Biegel, Bryan; Huang, Liang",Air Qual Atmos Health,,259

217833,Premature ovarian insufficiency secondary to COVID-19 infection: An original case report,2021,"During 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic affected almost 108 individuals. Quite a number of vaccines against COVID-19 were therefore developed, and a few recently received authorization for emergency use. Overall, these vaccines target specific viral proteins by antibodies whose synthesis is directly elicited or indirectly triggered by nucleic acids coding for the desired targets. Among these targets, the receptor binding domain (RBD) of COVID-19 spike protein (SP) does frequently occur in the repertoire of candidate vaccines. However, the immunogenicity of RBD per se is limited by its low molecular mass, and by a structural rearrangement of full-length SP accompanied by the detachment of RBD. Here we show that the RBD of COVID-19 SP can be conveniently produced in Escherichia coli when fused to a fragment of CRM197, a variant of diphtheria toxin currently used for a number of conjugated vaccines. In particular, we show that the CRM197-RBD chimera solubilized from inclusion bodies can be refolded and purified to a state featuring the 5 native disulphide bonds of the parental proteins, the competence in binding angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, and a satisfactory stability at room temperature. Accordingly, our observations provide compulsory information for the development of a candidate vaccine directed against COVID-19.","Bellone, Maria Laura; Puglisi, Andrea; Dal Piaz, Fabrizio; Hochkoeppler, Alejandro",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,,259

More than half of veterans who meet mental illness criteria do not seek help. This study screened for clinical symptoms and evaluated the efficacy of a brief, online social-contact-based video intervention in increasing treatment-seeking intentions among veterans. We hypothesized that the video-based intervention would increase treatment-seeking intentions more than written vignette and control conditions. METHODS: One hundred seventy-two veterans were randomized to either a (a) brief video-based intervention; (b) written vignette intervention, or (c) nonintervention control group. In the 3-min video, a veteran previously diagnosed with PTSD described his symptom reactivation by Covid-19, his barriers to care, and how therapy helped him to cope. Assessments were conducted at baseline, postintervention, and at 14- and 30-day follow-ups. RESULTS: A total of 91 (53%) veterans reported high levels of clinical symptoms, especially those self-reporting Covid-19 exposure. The brief video-based intervention yielded greater increase in treatment-seeking intentions among veterans. Within the video group, women showed an increase in treatment-seeking intentions from baseline to postintervention only, whereas men showed a more sustained effect, from baseline to Day 14. CONCLUSIONS: Surveyed veterans reported high symptoms levels. A brief video intervention increased treatment-seeking intention, likely through identification and emotional engagement with the video protagonist. This easily disseminable video-based intervention has the potential to increase likelihood of seeking care. Future research should examine longer term sustainability and changes in help-seeking behavior.","Amsalem, Doron; Lazarov, Amit; Markowitz, John C; Gorman, Daniel; Dixon, Lisa B; Neria, Yuval",Depress. anxiety,,259

Most human populations spend the majority of their time indoors and the COVID-19 pandemic has likely exacerbated this behavior. While significant amounts of research have focused on outdoor air quality, to date there have been no studies that examined simultaneous long-term trends on indoor and outdoor air quality on a site using research-grade sensors. We measured fine particulate matter (PM2.5) for a year using sensors located on the rooftop, air handling room, and indoor office space in a building and captured the impacts of three types of regularly occurring elevated pollution events: wintertime atmospheric inversions, wildfires, and fireworks. The events had different magnitudes and durations, and infiltration rates varied for each event leading to dissimilar indoor air pollution levels. The building's air handling unit and different environmental conditions (lower indoor humidity and temperature during the winter) combined to reduce indoor pollution from inversion events however, particulate matter from wildfires and fireworks infiltrated at higher rates. Together, this suggests possible intervention strategies, such as ventilation rates and filter upgrades, that could be used to mitigate contaminant intrusion during elevated pollution events. This year-long study illustrates an array of ways that elevated pollution events interact with the protective effects that buildings have against air pollution for its occupants. Furthermore, we show that outdoor air pollution is an important variable to consider when studying indoor air quality as contaminant infiltration is strongly dependent on the specific pollution source.","Mendoza, Daniel L; Benney, Tabitha M; Boll, Sarah",Sci Total Environ,,259

Medical care was based on isolation, azithromycin, vitamin C, zinc, vitamin D, salicylic acid, dexamethasone followed with methylprednisolone, and anticoagulation for all hospitalized patients. Tocilizumab was indicated for 17 patients with hyperferritinemia (20.23% of patients). The initial respiratory care of our patients required oxygen therapy using nasal cannula (7.14%) high concentration masks (33.33%), high flow nasal cannula treatment (11.9%), non-invasive ventilation (NIV) (5.95%), and mechanical ventilation (41.66%). Thrombolysis was performed in three subjects with myocardial infarction and 2 underwent angioplasty with placement of an active stent at the proximal interventricular anterior artery, which all were successful. Three massive pulmonary embolisms died despite adequate treatment. Colchicine and salicylic acid were administered for pericarditis cases. Thromboprophylaxis was indicated for all patients and was reinforced if a venous thrombotic episode was confirmed. Patients with limb ischemia underwent surgical treatment. Among the 84 patients included in our cohort, 34 (40.47%) died in intensive care unit and 50 (59.52%) had a favorable evolution. Conclusion: Cardiovascular involvement during COVID-19 should not be neglected and are associated with severe outcomes.","El Rhalete, Abdelilah; Rhazi, Inas; Bensaid, Amine; Zaid, Ikram; Bkiyer, Houssam; Ismaili, Nabila; Elouafi, Nouha; Housni, Brahim",Ann Med Surg (Lond),,259

To explore the underlying molecular mechanism of the lactation process in the mammary gland, transcriptome profiles of Iranian fat-tailed Ghezel sheep breed milk at two stages, before (BF) and after peak (AF) stages of lactation were investigated. Functional impacts of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between BF and AF stages were surveyed using Gene Ontology (GO) and Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) network analysis. Totally, 75 DEGs were identified between BF and AF stages of lactation. The RNA-Seq results were validated by Q-RT-PCR. Gene ontology of DEGs mainly enriched in metabolic process and oxidative phosphorylation. PPI network analysis also highlighted the contribution of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR) signaling, oxidative phosphorylation and metabolic pathways in the lactation process. Intriguingly, the genes involved in fat metabolism dominantly down-regulated at AF stage. Our results provide new insight into transcriptional changes and add to growing body of knowledge on the lactation process in fat-tailed sheep breeds.","Farhadian, Mohammad; Rafat, Seyed Aabbas; Panahi, Bahman; Ebrahimie, Esmaeil",Anim Biotechnol,,259
223078,COVID-19 and preeclampsia with severe features at 34-weeks gestation,2020,"BACKGROUND Imaging-based quantitative assessment of lung lesions plays a key role in patient triage and therapeutic decision-making processes. The aim of our study was to validate the Total Severity Score (TSS), Chest Computed Tomography Score (CT-S), and Chest CT Severity Score (CT-SS) scales, which were used to assess the extent of lung inflammation in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection in terms of interobserver agreement and the correlation of scores with patient clinical condition on the day of the study. MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 77 chest CT scans collected from 77 consecutive patients hospitalized because of SARS-CoV-2 were included. The scans were assessed independently by 2 radiologists aware of the patients' positive results of RT-PCR tests. Each chest CT was assessed according to the 3 scales. To assess the interobserver agreement of CT scan assessments, Cohen's k and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) were calculated. RESULTS For the overall assessment, the k was 0.944 and the ICC was 0.948 for the TSS; the kappa was 0.909 and the ICC was 0.919 for the CT-S; and the k was 0.888 and the ICC was 0.899 for the CT-SS. The CT-SS (r=0.627 for Radiologist 1 and r=0.653 for Radiologist 2) revealed the strongest positive correlation with the patient clinical condition as expressed using the Modified Early Warning Score. CONCLUSIONS The interobserver agreement for the 3 evaluated scales was very good. The CT-SS was found to have the strongest positive relationship with the Modified Early Warning Score.","Mruk, Bartosz; Plucinska, Dominika; Walecki, Jerzy; Póltorak-Szymczak, Gabriela; Sklinda, Katarzyna",Med Sci Monit,,259

223543,"Letter to the Editor: ""Our Response to COVID-19 as Endocrinologists and Diabetologists""",2020,"BACKGROUND: Breastfeeding offers short- and long- term health benefits to mothers and children and constitutes a priority for public health. Evidence shows that SARS-CoV-2 is not likely to be transmitted via breastmilk. Moreover, antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 are presumably contained in breastmilk of mothers with history of COVID-19 infection or vaccination. Direct breastfeeding is the preferred infant feeding option during the pandemic, but conflicting practices have been adopted, which could widen existing disparities in breastfeeding. This study aims to describe how was information about breastfeeding communicated in Mexican media during the pandemic and assess Mexican adults' beliefs regarding breastfeeding among mothers infected with COVID-19. METHODS: A retrospective content analysis of media coverage on breastfeeding in Mexico between March 1 and September 24, 2020, excluding advertisements, was done. For the content analysis, both a sentiment analysis and an analysis based on strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats for breastfeeding promotion were performed. Also, we incorporated a descriptive analysis from the July 2020 wave of the ENCOVID-19 survey, which included questions on beliefs about breastfeeding. This information was stratified by gender, age, and socioeconomic status. RESULTS: 1014 publications on breastfeeding were identified in internet, newspapers, TV, and magazines. Most information was published during World Breastfeeding Week, celebrated in August. Based on the sentiment analysis, 57.2% of all information was classified as positive, and based on the SWOT analysis, most information was classified either as strengths or opportunities for breastfeeding promotion. However, the ENCOVID-19 data showed that 67.3% of people living in households with children under 3 years of age believe that mothers with COVID-19 should not breastfeed, and 19.8% stated that they simply didn't know. These beliefs showed differences both by gender and by socioeconomic status. CONCLUSIONS: While the Mexican government endorsed the recommendations on breastfeeding during the COVID-19 pandemic, communication of those messages was sporadic, inconstant and unequal across types of media. Moreover, there were also negative messages for breastfeeding circulating on the media. There continues to be a widespread notion that mothers with COVID-19 should not breastfeed and, due to differences on beliefs by socioeconomic status, health inequities could be exacerbated.","Vilar-Compte, M.; Gaitán-Rossi, P.; Rhodes, E.

224898,Teaching During the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Experience of the Faculty of Medicine at the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology,2021,"The Coronaviridae family comprises large enveloped single-stranded RNA viruses. The known human-infecting coronaviruses; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), novel SARS-CoV-2, human coronavirus (HCoV)-NL63, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43 and HKU1 cause mild to severe respiratory infections. The viral diseases induced by mammalian and avian viruses from Coronaviridae family pose significant economic and public health burdens. Due to increasing reports of viral resistance, co-infections and the emergence of viral epidemics such as COVID-19, available antiviral drugs show low or no efficacy, and the production of new treatments or vaccines are also challenging. Therefore, demand for the development of novel antivirals has considerably increased. In recent years, antiviral peptides have generated increasing interest as they are from natural and computational sources, are highly specific and effective, and possess the broad-spectrum activity with minimum side effects. Here, we have made an effort to compile and review the antiviral peptides with activity against Coronaviridae family viruses. They were divided into different categories according to their action mechanisms, including binding/attachment inhibitors, fusion and entry inhibitors, viral enzyme inhibitors, replication inhibitors and the peptides with direct and indirect effects on the viruses. Reported studies suggest optimism with regard to the design and production of therapeutically promising antiviral drugs. This review aims to summarize data relating to antiviral peptides particularly with respect to their applicability for development as novel treatments.","Heydari, Hamid; Golmohammadi, Reza; Mirnejad, Reza; Tebyanian, Hamid; Fasihi-Ramandi, Mahdi; Moosazadeh Moghaddam, Mehrdad",Peptides,,259

METHODS: Fifty-six patients, who were admitted to the emergency clinic and diagnosed with COVID-19 infection, were included in the study. Data on clinical characteristics, inflammatory parameters and vitamin D status were recorded for each patient. All the participants had data on 25-hydroxyvitamin D status within the last 6 months prior to COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: The patients were stratified as those with vitamin D status less than 20 ng/mL and higher than 20 ng/mL. A group with vitamin D status less than 20 ng/mL had lower lymphocyte counts and lower haemoglobin levels that was statistically significant (respectively; p = 0.021, p = 0.035). Higher C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were seen in the vitamin D-deficient group (p = 0.013). It was observed that vitamin D status of the patients who required oxygen therapy were lower than those who did not require oxygen therapy, not statistically significant (p = 0.05). Patients who did not use vitamin D supplementation within 6 months prior to COVID-19 infection had more likely to be diagnosed with pneumonia (p = 0.004). CONCLUSION: Cases with lower vitamin D status had increased inflammatory markers and worse clinical outcomes than patients with higher vitamin D status. This study suggests that vitamin D status can be used as a prognostic factor in COVID-19 patients, and vitamin D supplementation can be recommended to improve the clinical outcomes in COVID-19 infection.","Ünsal, Y A; Gül, Ö Ö; Cander, S; Ersoy, C; Aydemir, E; Ates, C; Uzun, Z; Armagan, E; Ünsal, O; Ertürk, E",J. endocrinol. invest,,259

Government-initiated measures to decrease healthcare utilization (i.e., ""flattening the curve"") have included shelter-in-place mandates and social distancing, which have taken effect across most of the USA. We evaluate the immediate impact of the Public Health Messaging and shelter-in-place mandates on Emergency Department (ED) demand for radiology services. METHODS: We analyzed ED radiology volumes from the five University of California health systems during a 2-week time period following the shelter-in-place mandate and compared those volumes with March 2019 and early April 2019 volumes. RESULTS: ED radiology volumes declined from the 2019 baseline by 32 to 40% (p < 0.001) across the five health systems with a total decrease in volumes across all 5 systems by 35% (p < 0.001). Stratifying by subspecialty, the smallest declines were seen in non-trauma thoracic imaging, which decreased 18% (p value < 0.001), while all other non-trauma studies decreased by 48% (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Total ED radiology demand may be a marker for public adherence to shelter-in-place mandates, though ED chest radiology demand may increase with an increase in COVID-19 cases.","Houshyar, Roozbeh; Tran-Harding, Karen; Glavis-Bloom, Justin; Nguyentat, Michael; Mongan, John; Chahine, Chantal; Loehfelm, Thomas W; Kohli, Marc D; Zaragoza, Edward J; Murphy, Paul M; Kampalath, Rony",Emerg. radiol,,259

Emerging adulthood is a developmental phase with significant changes in the patterns of daily living; it is a risky phase for the onset of major mental illness. College students during the pandemic face significant risk, potentially losing several protective factors (eg, housing, routine, social support, job, and financial security) that are stabilizing for mental health and physical well-being. Individualized multiple assessments of mental health, referred to as multimodal personal chronicles, present an opportunity to examine indicators of health in an ongoing and personalized way using mobile sensing devices and wearable internet of things. OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility and provide an in-depth examination of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on college students through multimodal personal chronicles, we present a case study of an individual monitored using a longitudinal subjective and objective assessment approach over a 9-month period throughout 2020, spanning the prepandemic period of January through September. METHODS: The individual, referred to as Lee, completed psychological assessments measuring depression, anxiety, and loneliness across 4 time points in January, April, June, and September. We used the data emerging from the multimodal personal chronicles (ie, heart rate, sleep, physical activity, affect, behaviors) in relation to psychological assessments to understand patterns that help to explicate changes in the individual's psychological well-being across the pandemic. RESULTS: Over the course of the pandemic, Lee's depression severity was highest in April, shortly after shelter-in-place orders were mandated. His depression severity remained mildly severe throughout the rest of the months. Associations in positive and negative affect, physiology, sleep, and physical activity patterns varied across time periods. Lee's positive affect and negative affect were positively correlated in April (r=0.53, P=.04) whereas they were negatively correlated in September (r=-0.57, P=.03). Only in the month of January was sleep negatively associated with negative affect (r=-0.58, P=.03) and diurnal beats per minute (r=-0.54, P=.04), and then positively associated with heart rate variability (resting root mean square of successive differences between normal heartbeats) (r=0.54, P=.04). When looking at his available contextual data, Lee noted certain situations as supportive coping factors and other situations as potential stressors. CONCLUSIONS: We observed more pandemic concerns in April and noticed other contextual events relating to this individual's well-being, reflecting how college students continue to experience life events during the pandemic. The rich monitoring data alongside contextual data may be beneficial for clinicians to understand client experiences and offer personalized treatment plans. We discuss benefits as well as future directions of this system, and the conclusions we can draw regarding the links between the COVID-19 pandemic and college student mental health.","Lai, Jocelyn; Rahmani, Amir; Yunusova, Asal; Rivera, Alexander P; Labbaf, Sina; Hu, Sirui; Dutt, Nikil; Jain, Ramesh; Borelli, Jessica L",JMIR Form Res,,259
234607,Deprescribing Proton Pump Inhibitors,2020,"In the nonresonant regime, molecular conductance decays exponentially with distance, limiting the fabrication of efficient molecular semiconductors at the nanoscale. In this work, we calculate the conductance of a series of acene derivatives connected to gold electrodes using density functional theory (DFT) combined with the nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF) formalism. We show that these systems have near length-independent conductance and can exhibit a conductance increase with molecular length depending on the connection to the electrodes. The analysis of the molecular orbital energies and transmission functions attribute this behavior to the dramatic decrease of the highest occupied molecular orbital-lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (HOMO-LUMO) gap with length, which shifts the transmission peaks near the Fermi level. These results demonstrate that the anchoring configuration determines the conductance behavior of acene derivatives, which are optimal building blocks to fabricate single-molecule devices with tunable charge transport properties.","Valdiviezo, Jesús; Rocha, Paulina; Polakovsky, Anastazia; Palma, Julio L",ACS Sens,,259

An anonymous online self-administered survey using Google Forms has been conducted between December 1st to December 15th, 2020 among the HCP in Greece and the Republic of Cyprus. A total of 2,238 HCPs participated in the study (1,220/54.5% from Republic of Cyprus and 1,018 from Greece). Overall 1,082 (48.3%) stressed their intention to get vaccinated (64.4% for Greece and 34.9% for Republic of Cyprus). The main reasons for those who intend to get the COVID-19 vaccine include self (94.2%), family (98.7%), and patients protection (95.2%) as well as mitigation of COVID-19 pandemic (95.4%). The multivariate logistic regression that was performed for the total sample revealed that the following variables were significantly associated with an increased probability to get vaccinated against COVID-19: being a physician, a member of the nursing personnel, paramedical staff, working in Greece, age, the belief that influenza vaccination should be mandatory for HCP, and the rating of the overall management of COVID-19 pandemic in the country and from the public hospitals. Physicians were more likely to get vaccinated against COVID-19 than other HCP. The age was a predictor of COVID-19 uptake intention in the Republic of Cyprus. The belief that there was a successful management of the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to the intention to COVID-19 vaccination uptake.","Raftopoulos, Vasilios; Iordanou, Stelios; Katsapi, Angeliki; Dedoukou, Xanthi; Maltezou, Helena C",Hum Vaccin Immunother,,259

A study of greenhouse tomato plants in Israel revealed severe new viral disease symptoms including open unripe fruits and yellow patched leaves. PepMV was only detected in mixed infections with ToBRFV in all 104 tested sites, using serological and molecular analyses. Six PepMV isolates were identified, all had predicted amino acids characteristic of CH2 mild strains excluding an isoleucine at amino acid position 995 of the replicase. High-throughput sequencing of viral RNA extracted from four selected symptomatic plants showed solely the ToBRFV and PepMV, with total aligned read ratios of 40.61% and 11.73%, respectively, indicating prevalence of the viruses. Analyses of interactions between the co-infecting viruses by sequential and mixed viral inoculations of tomato plants, at various temperatures, showed a prominent increase in PepMV titers in ToBRFV pre-inoculated plants and in mixed-infected plants at 18-25 °C, compared to PepMV-single inoculations, as analyzed by Western blot and quantitative RT-PCR tests. These results suggest that Israeli mild PepMV isolate infections, preceded by ToBRFV, could induce symptoms characteristic of PepMV aggressive strains.","Klap, Chen; Luria, Neta; Smith, Elisheva; Hadad, Lior; Bakelman, Elena; Sela, Noa; Belausov, Eduard; Lachman, Oded; Leibman, Diana; Dombrovsky, Aviv",Viruses,,259

Gene expression in AT2 cells is regulated in a tissue and cell-specific manner and in a temporal fashion. The availability of tissue and cell-specific RNA datasets in Human Protein Atlas led to the identification of localized expression patterns of BCL-2 family members such as BCL2 related protein A1 (BCL2A1) in AT2 cells and immune cells of the lung. BCL2A1 expression was regulated by multiple stimuli including Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands, interferons (IFNs), inflammatory cytokines, and inhibited by the steroid dexamethasone. In this study, regulation of BCL2A1 gene expression in human lung epithelial cells by several respiratory viruses and type I interferon signaling was investigated. SARS-CoV-2 infection significantly induced BCL2A1 expression in human lung epithelial cells within 24 hours that required the expression of Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). BCL2A1 mRNA induction by SARS-CoV-2 was correlated with the induced expression of IFN-{beta} and IFN-regulated transcription factor mRNA. BCL2A1 was induced by IFN-{beta} treatment or by infection with influenza virus lacking the non-structural protein1(NS1) in NHBE cells. Furthermore, bioinformatics revealed that a subset of BCL-2 family members involved in the control of apoptosis and transcription such as BCL2A1, BCL2L14, BCL3, and BCL6 were regulated in the lung epithelial cells by coronaviruses and in the lung tissue samples of COVID-19 patients. Transcriptomic data also suggested that these genes were differentially regulated by the steroid drug dexamethasone.","Chilakamarti, Ramana",,,259

239714,Prothrombotic State in COVID-19: Myth or Reality?,2021,"Among various geopolitical repercussions of the COVID-19 pandemic are redefinitions of the short-term priorities of many international organizations. Among others, the European Union (EU) and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) are becoming absorbed by new internal challenges, and are thus even less interested in further enlargement than before. Against this background, Kyiv, Tbilisi, and Chisinau, as well as their Western friends, need to seek new paths to increase the three countries’ security, resilience, and growth before their accession to the West’s major organizations. Above all, an alternative way to decrease Ukraine’s current institutional isolation is to develop more intense bilateral relations with friendly states across the globe, including Germany and the United States. In Eastern Europe, moreover, Ukraine, Georgia, and Moldova should attempt to create new multilateral networks with post-communist member countries of NATO as well as the EU, and try to become part of such structures as the Three Seas Initiative or Bucharest Nine group.","Klimkin, Pavlo; Umland, Andreas",World Aff.,,259
239834,The pattern of post-viral arthritis in covid pandemic state: An experience of tertiary care centre,2021,"BACKGROUND: To better understand SARS-CoV-2 shedding duration and infectivity, we estimated SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding duration, described characteristics associated with viral RNA shedding resolution1, and determined if replication-competent viruses could be recovered &#8805;10 days after symptom onset among individuals with mild to moderate COVID-19. METHODS: We collected serial nasopharyngeal specimens at various time points from 109 individuals with rRT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 in Utah and Wisconsin. We calculated probability of viral RNA shedding resolution using the Kaplan-Meier estimator and evaluated characteristics associated with shedding resolution using Cox proportional hazards regression. We attempted viral culture for 35 rRT-PCR-positive nasopharyngeal specimens collected &#8805;10 days after symptom onset. RESULTS: The likelihood of viral RNA shedding resolution at 10 days after symptom onset was approximately 3%. Time to shedding resolution was shorter among participants aged <18 years (adjusted hazards ratio [aHR]: 3.01; 95% CI: 1.6-5.6) and longer among those aged &#8805;50 years (aHR: 0.50; 95% CI: 0.3-0.9) compared to participants aged 18-49 years. No replication-competent viruses were recovered.

245654,Secure the availability of labor: Extension of annual paid leave settlement between healthcare workers and employers is good for post COVID-19 recovery,2020,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Walking in water is used for rehabilitation in different pathological conditions. For the characterization of gait alterations related to pathology, gait timing assessment is of primary importance. With the widespread use of inertial sensors, several algorithms have been proposed for gait timing estimation (i.e. gait events and temporal parameters) out of the water, while an assessment of their performance for walking in water is still missing. The purpose of the present study was to assess the performance in the temporal segmentation for gait in water of 17 algorithms proposed in the literature. METHODS: Ten healthy volunteers mounting 5 tri-axial inertial sensors (trunk, shanks and feet) walked on dry land and in water. Seventeen different algorithms were implemented and classified based on: 1) sensor position, 2) target variable, and 3) computational approach. Gait events identified from synchronized video recordings were assumed as reference. Temporal parameters were calculated from gait events. Algorithm performance was analysed in terms of sensitivity, positive predictive value, accuracy, and repeatability. RESULTS: For walking in water, all Trunk-based algorithms provided a sensitivity lower than 81% and a positive predictive value lower than 94%, as well as acceleration-based algorithms, independently from sensor location, with the exception of two Shank-based ones. Drop in algorithm sensitivity and positive predictive value was associated to significant differences in the stride pattern of the specific analysed variables during walking in water as compared to walking on dry land, as shown by the intraclass correlation coefficient. When using Shank- or Foot-based algorithms, gait events resulted delayed, but the delay was compensated in the estimate of Stride and Step time; a general underestimation of Stance- and overestimation of Swing-time was observed, with minor exceptions. CONCLUSION: Sensor position, target variable and computational approach determined different error distributions for different gait events and temporal parameters for walking in water. This work supports an evidence-based selection of the most appropriate algorithm for gait timing estimation for walking in water as related to the specific application, and provides relevant information for the design of new algorithms for the specific motor task.","Pacini Panebianco, Giulia; Bisi, Maria Cristina; Stagni, Rita; Fantozzi, Silvia",Comput Methods Programs Biomed,,259
245890,COVID-19-Induced Diabetic Ketoacidosis in an Adult with Latent Autoimmune Diabetes,2021,"INTRODUCTION: SARS-CoV-2, coronavirus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), was first detected in Spain on 31 January 2020. On 14 March 2020, a state of emergency was declared in Spain in a bid to control the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in the country. The aim of our study is to analyse the impact on emergency medicine attendance after the national lockdown, as well as the clinical presentation and the management of patients with suspected COVID-19 in the Paediatric Emergency Department. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective observational study included children and adolescents under the age of 18, attended in our Paediatric Emergency Department during the period March 14 to April 17, 2020. RESULTS: A total of 1,666 patients were attended during the study period, 65.4% less than in the same period of 2019. Just over half (51.2%) were males, and mean age was 5.4 years. In triage, 39.9% were high priority levels, 6.5% more than 2019. Most frequent reasons for consultation at the Paediatric Emergency Department were fever (26.5%), respiratory symptoms (16.1%), and trauma (15.2%). A total of 218 patients (13%) received a diagnosis of possible COVID-19, with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed in 18.4%, and 23.8% (52/218) were hospitalised. At discharge, 44% (96/218) were diagnosed with lower, and 33.9% (74/218) with upper respiratory infection. CONCLUSIONS: During the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, the demand for urgent paediatric care decreased, with the proportion of cases with high priority triage levels increasing. Most of the patients with suspected or microbiological confirmation of COVID-19 had mild respiratory symptoms.","Molina Gutiérrez, Miguel Ángel; Ruiz Domínguez, José Antonio; Bueno Barriocanal, Marta; de Miguel Lavisier, Begoña; López López, Rosario; Martín Sánchez, Julia; de Ceano-Vivas la Calle, María",An. pediatr.

Seventeen randomized-controlled trials were included with a total of 1,477 participants. Results indicated small effects of home-based training on muscle strength (between-study standardised-mean-difference [SMD] = 0.30), muscle power (SMD = 0.43), muscular endurance (SMD = 0.28), and balance (SMD = 0.28). We found no statistically significant effects for single-mode strength vs. multimodal training (e.g., combined balance, strength, and flexibility exercises) on measures of muscle strength and balance. Single-mode strength training had moderate effects on muscle strength (SMD = 0.51) and balance (SMD = 0.65) while multimodal training had no statistically significant effects on muscle strength and balance. Irrespective of the training type, >3 weekly sessions produced larger effects on muscle strength (SMD = 0.45) and balance (SMD = 0.37) compared with &#8804;3 weekly sessions (muscle strength: SMD = 0.28; balance: SMD = 0.24). For session-duration, only &#8804;30 min per-session produced small effects on muscle strength (SMD = 0.35) and balance (SMD = 0.34). No statistically significant differences were observed between all independently-computed single-training factors. Home-based exercise appears effective to improve components of health- (i.e., muscle strength and muscular endurance) and skill-related (i.e., muscle power, balance) physical-fitness. Therefore, in times of restricted physical activity due to pandemics, home-based exercises constitute an alternative to counteract physical inactivity and preserve/improve the health and fitness of healthy older adults aged 65-to-83 years.","Chaabene, H; Prieske, O; Herz, M; Moran, J; Höhne, J; Kliegl, R; Ramirez-Campillo, R; Behm, D G; Hortobágyi, T; Granacher, U",Ageing Res Rev,,259

To identify the frequency and features of SARS-CoV-2 involvement, we performed a clinicopathologic analysis of 75 placental cases from women infected at the time of delivery and 75 uninfected controls. Placental samples were studied with anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunohistochemistry and/or in situ hybridization. Positive results were confirmed by electron microscopy and quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). During delivery, only one woman had symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019, six women reported previous symptoms, and 68 women were asymptomatic. All neonates tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 as per nasopharyngeal swab PCR results. Obstetric histories were unremarkable in 29 of 75 SARS-CoV-2-positive and 8 of 75 SARS-CoV-2-negative women. Placental examination was normal in 12 of 75 infected and 3 of 75 uninfected subjects, respectively. In the remaining cases, placental pathology correlated with obstetric comorbidities without significant differences between SARS-CoV-2-positive and SARS-CoV-2-negative women. SARS-CoV-2 was identified in one placenta of an infected, but asymptomatic, parturient. Viral staining was predominantly localized to the syncytiotrophoblast (STB) which demonstrated marked damage accompanied by perivillous fibrin deposition and mixed intervillositis. A significant decrease of viral titers was detected in the attached umbilical cord compared with the villous parenchyma as per qRT-PCR. SARS-CoV-2 is seldom identified in placentas of infected women. Placental involvement by the virus is characterized by STB damage disrupting the placental barrier and can be seen in asymptomatic mothers without evidence of vertical transmission.","Debelenko, Larisa; Katsyv, Igor; Chong, Alexander M; Peruyero, Leonore; Szabolcs, Matthias; Uhlemann, Anne-Catrin",Hum Pathol,,259
254552,Covid-19: Spiking a focus on men's health,2020,"Objectives: The International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (IFCC) Task Force on COVID-19 conducted a global survey to understand how biochemistry laboratories manage the operational challenges during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Materials and methods: An electronic survey was distributed globally to record the operational considerations to mitigate biosafety risks in the laboratory. Additionally, the laboratories were asked to indicate the operational challenges they faced. Results: A total of 1210 valid submissions were included in this analysis. Most of the survey participants worked in hospital laboratories. Around 15% of laboratories restricted certain tests on patients with clinically suspected or confirmed COVID-19 over biosafety concerns. Just over 10% of the laboratories had to restrict their test menu or services due to resource constraints. Approximately a third of laboratories performed temperature monitoring, while two thirds of laboratories increased the frequency of disinfection. Just less than 50% of the laboratories split their teams. The greatest reported challenge faced by laboratories during the COVID-19 pandemic is securing sufficient supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE), analytical equipment, including those used at the point of care, as well as reagents, consumables and other laboratory materials. This was followed by having inadequate staff, managing their morale, anxiety and deployment. Conclusions: The restriction of tests and services may have undesirable clinical consequences as clinicians are deprived of important information to deliver appropriate care to their patients. Staff rostering and biosafety concerns require longer-term solutions as they are crucial for the continued operation of the laboratory during what may well be a prolonged pandemic.","Loh, Tze Ping; Horvath, Andrea Rita; Wang, Cheng-Bin; Koch, David; Adeli, Khosrow; Mancini, Nicasio; Ferrari, Maurizio; Hawkins, Robert; Sethi, Sunil; Lippi, Giuseppe",Clin Chem Lab Med,,259

Quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) analyses were performed routinely, including measurement of the minimal lumen diameter and calculation of the percentage diameter stenosis. The procedural success rate, the frequency of peri-procedural complications, and the incidence rates of major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) over nine months were assessed. The primary endpoint in the study was the percentage diameter stenosis. RESULTS: Procedure success was achieved in most patients in both groups (75.9%). Patients in the ELCA group exhibited a lower percentage diameter stenosis (24.5 ± 9.09 vs. 35.1 ± 18.6, p = 0.048) and a larger minimal lumen diameter (2.36 ± 0.29 mm vs. 1.78 ± 0.64 mm, p < 0.001) than those in the control group and the 9-month incidence rates of MACEs did not differ (9.5% vs 15.8%, p = 0.699). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that ELCA may be a safe and effective technique in the treatment of ISR CTOs, and the use of ELCA can achieve good immediate angiographic results, as measured by QCA, without increasing peri-procedural complications or the incidence rates of 9-month MACEs.","Li, Hui; Ai, Hu; Li, Le; Zheng, Naixin; Tang, Guodong; Yang, Guojian; Zhao, Ying; Sun, Fucheng; Zhang, Huiping",BMC Cardiovasc Disord,,259
255146,161 Analysis of an ambulatory care pathway for patients with COVID-19 utilising remote pulse oximetry,2020,"The impact of negative lymph nodes (LNs) on survival of pN+ patients has been recognized. The weight of negative LNs in an inverse lymph node ratio (nR) should be related to its prognostic impact. Five hundred and two consecutive gastric cancer patients, who underwent radical gastrectomy, were included. Patients were split into groups according to the number of harvested nodes and a cross-tabulation with pTNM stages was performed to test differences in the tumor burden. pN+ patients (n = 296) were split into groups of negative LNs harvested. We tested an alternative formula for computing a lymph node ratio: nR = total number of harvested nodes/total number of positive nodes. The median number of negative LNs was significantly different (p < 0.01) between dissection groups, but not the median of positive nodes (p > 0.05). No difference in pTNM percentage distribution was found between these groups (p > 0.05). When tested, the overall survival improved significantly for groups with larger numbers of negative LNs (p < 0.001). A cutoff of nR &#8805; 6 was an independent prognostic factor for survival (p = 0.001), and the survival of pN+ patients with nR &#8805; 6 was not different from pN0 patients. The impact of the number of negative LNs on the survival of the pN+ patients was demonstrated. The higher numbers in the numerator of the nR was due to the disproportion between harvested negative LNs and metastatic LNs. Larger ratios imply more negative lymph nodes in relation to positive lymph nodes, which was significantly associated with survival. We believe that the proposed nR is a friendlier to use format because of its intuitive interpretation.","da Costa, Paulo Matos; Lages, Patrícia; Onofre, Susana; Ribeiro, Ruy M",Updates surg.

OBJECTIVE: Characterize safety and occurrence of immediate relapses following COVID-19 vaccination in a large cohort of MS patients. METHODS: We assessed the safety of BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccination in adult MS patients. RESULTS: Between 20 December 2020 and 25 January 2021, 555 MS patients received the first dose of BNT162b2 vaccine and 435 received the second dose. There were three cases of COVID-19 infection encountered after the first dose. Safety profile of COVID-19 vaccine was characterized by pain at the injection site, fatigue, and headache. No increased risk of relapse activity was noted over a median follow-up of 20 and 38 days after first and second vaccine doses, respectively. The rate of patients with acute relapse was 2.1% and 1.6% following the first and second doses, respectively, similar to the rate in non-vaccinating patients during the corresponding period. Mild increase in the rate of adverse events was noted in younger patients (18-55 years), among patients with lower disability (Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) â©½3.0), and in patients treated with immunomodulatory drugs.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: We conducted a prospective single arm phase I-II clinical trial enrolling patients &#8805; 50 years-old COVID-19 positive, at phase II or III with lung involvement at imaging study and oxygen requirement. Patients received 100 cGy to total lungs in a single fraction. Primary outcome was radiological response using severity and extension score on baseline CT, at day 3 and 7 after LD-RT. Secondary outcomes were toxicity using CTCAE v5, duration of hospitalization, blood work evolution and oxygen requirements using SatO2/ FiO2 index (SAFI), at day 3 and 7 after LD-RT . RESULTS: Nine patients were included. Median age was 66 (IQR 57-77). Severity score was stable or decreased in the third CT but no statistically significant (p=0.28), however, there were statistically significant changes in the extension score (p=0.03). SAFI index significantly improved 72 hours and 1 week after LD-RT (p=0.01). Inflammatory blood parameters decreased one week after RT compared with baseline, only LDH decreased significantly (p=0.04). Two patients presented grade 2 lymphopenia after RT and another worsened to grade 4 being its baseline grade 3. Overall, the median number of days of hospitalization was 59 days (range 26-151). After RT the median number of days in hospital was 13 days (4-77). With a median follow-up after RT of 112 days (105-150), seven patients were discharged and two patients died, one due to sepsis and the other with severe baseline COPD from COVID-19 pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary results show that LD-RT was a feasible and well-tolerated treatment, with potential clinical improvement. Randomized trials are needed to establish whether LD-RT improves severe pneumonia.","Sanmamed, N; Alcantara, P; Cerezo, E; Gaztañaga, M; Cabello, N; Gómez, S; Bustos, A; Doval, A; Corona, J; Rodriguez, G; Duffort, M; Ortuño, F; de Castro, J; Fuentes, M; Sanz, A; López, A; Vazquez, M",Int. j. radiat. oncol. biol. phys,,259

However, the cellular mechanism behind the sudden loss of smell has not yet been investigated. The initial step of odour detection takes place in the pseudostratified olfactory epithelium (OE) mainly composed of olfactory sensory neurons surrounded by supporting cells known as sustentacular cells. The olfactory neurons project their axons to the olfactory bulb in the central nervous system offering a potential pathway for pathogens to enter the central nervous system by bypassing the blood brain barrier. In the present study, we explored the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the olfactory system in golden Syrian hamsters. We observed massive damage of the OE as early as 2 days post nasal instillation of SARS-CoV-2, resulting in a major loss of cilia necessary for odour detection. These damages were associated with infection of a large proportion of sustentacular cells but not of olfactory neurons, and we did not detect any presence of the virus in the olfactory bulbs. We observed massive infiltration of immune cells in the OE and lamina propria of infected animals, which may contribute to the desquamation of the OE. The OE was partially restored 14 days post infection. Anosmia observed in COVID-19 patient is therefore likely to be linked to a massive and fast desquamation of the OE following sustentacular cells infection with SARS-CoV-2 and subsequent recruitment of immune cells in the OE and lamina propria.","Bryche, Bertrand; St Albin, Audrey; Murri, Severine; Lacôte, Sandra; Pulido, Coralie; Ar Gouilh, Meriadeg; Lesellier, Sandrine; Servat, Alexandre; Wasniewski, Marine; Picard-Meyer, Evelyne; Monchatre-Leroy, Elodie; Volmer, Romain; Rampin, Olivier; Le Goffic, Ronan; Marianneau, Philippe; Meunier, Nicolas",Brain Behav Immun,,259

As no such studies have been carried out in Spain, our objective is to describe and quantify the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cancer patients in Spanish hospitals during the first wave of the pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective, multicenter, nationwide study collected information from hospital departments treating oncology patients. An electronic questionnaire comparing outcomes and management of oncohematological patients for the March-June 2019 and March-June 2020 periods was used. RESULTS: Information from 78 departments (36 tertiary hospitals) was analyzed. Forty-four departments implemented adapted protocols during March 2020. Most of these (n = 38/44; 86.4%) carried out COVID-19 triage, while 26 of 44 (59.1%) carried out onsite polymerase chain reaction tests for clinically suspected cases. A shift from in-person to telephone visits was observed in 43 of 44 (97.7%) departments. Comparing the March-June 2019 and March-June 2020 periods, the number of new patients decreased by 20.8% (from 160.2 to 126.4). Decreases were also seen in the mean number of total (2858.2 versus 1686.1) and cancer (465.5 versus 367.2) biopsies, as well as the mean number of bone marrow biopsies (30.5 versus 18.6). Concerning the number of patients visiting specific cancer care departments, a decrease from 2019 to 2020 was seen for mean number of chemotherapy treatments (712.7 versus 643.8) and radiation therapy (2169.9 versus 2139.9). Finally, a reduction from 2019 to 2020 of 12.9% (from 8.6 to 7.4) in the mean number of patients included in clinical trials was noted. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first comprehensive data concerning the impact of COVID-19 on cancer care in Spain. The pandemic caused a 20.8% decrease in newly diagnosed patients, which may impact future outcomes. Measures must be taken to ensure cancer management receives priority in times of healthcare emergencies.","Amador, M; Matias-Guiu, X; Sancho-Pardo, G; Contreras Martinez, J; de la Torre-Montero, J C; Peñuelas Saiz, A; Garrido, P; García-Sanz, R; Rodríguez-Lescure, Á; Paz-Ares, L",ESMO Open,,259
262517,Clinical Screening for COVID-19 in Asymptomatic Patients With Cancer,2020,"BACKGROUND: Mobile phone apps have been leveraged to combat the spread of COVID-19. However, little is known about these technologies' characteristics, technical features, and various applications in health care when responding to this public health crisis. The lack of understanding has led developers and governments to make poor choices about apps' designs, which resulted in creating less useful apps that are overall less appealing to consumers due to their technical flaws. OBJECTIVE: This review aims to identify, analyze, and categorize health apps related to COVID-19 that are currently available for consumers in app stores; in particular, it focuses on exploring their key technical features and classifying the purposes that these apps were designed to serve. METHODS: A review of health apps was conducted using the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines. The Apple Store and Google Play were searched between April 20 and September 11, 2020. An app was included if it was dedicated for this disease and was listed under the health and medical categories in these app stores. The descriptions of these apps were extracted from the apps' web pages and thematically analyzed via open coding to identify both their key technical features and overall purpose. The characteristics of the included apps were summarized and presented with descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Of the 298 health apps that were initially retrieved, 115 met the inclusion criteria. A total of 29 technical features were found in our sample of apps, which were then categorized into five key purposes of apps related to COVID-19. A total of 77 (67%) apps were developed by governments or national authorities and for the purpose of promoting users to track their personal health (9/29, 31%). Other purposes included raising awareness on how to combat COVID-19 (8/29, 27%), managing exposure to COVID-19 (6/29, 20%), monitoring health by health care professionals (5/29, 17%), and conducting research studies (1/29, 3.5%). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides an overview and taxonomy of the health apps currently available in the market to combat COVID-19 based on their differences in basic technical features and purpose. As most of the apps were provided by governments or national authorities, it indicates the essential role these apps have as tools in public health crisis management. By involving most of the population in self-tracking their personal health and providing them with the technology to self-assess, the role of these apps is deemed to be a key driver for a participatory approach to curtail the spread of COVID-19. Further effort is required from researchers to evaluate these apps' effectiveness and from governmental organizations to increase public awareness of these digital solutions.","Almalki, Manal; Giannicchi, Anna",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,,259
263196,Telehealth and humanism: unexpected partnership forged during COVID-19,2020,"Introduction: The outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) have changed into a global crisis. Psychologically, this process of alteration can lead to feelings of fear, insecurity, and anxiety. This fear and anxiety can be caused by a variety of factors. However, due to the lack of extensive studies at this time, there are little data on these conditions related to COVID-19. Therefore, in this narrative review, we have tried to identify the most important possible causes of anxiety and fear due to this disease, based on logical shreds of evidence. Then we tried to discuss the consequences and ways to manage and prevent them. Methods: The current focus was on three major axes of corona-phobia, fear and anxiety. PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus, Google Scholar and authoritative news and information sources were considered as the data sources. Results: Findings from the analysis of the results revealed that, in addition to the real and the logical reasons which belong to the intrinsic properties of SARS-CoV-2, some misleadings and misconceptions induced by media, governmental policies, public awareness level, and non-scientific speculations and contradictory data expressed by experts, researchers and scientific societies, could provide the way for the development of corona-phobia, and fear. Conclusions: Each of these causal components, in its place, leads to some degrees of psychological disorders and subsequent consequences and complications. Finally, here we reviewed, summarized the previous research findings on how to prevent and manage this type of psychological disorder, and made comparisons.","Heiat, M; Heiat, F; Halaji, M; Ranjbar, R; Tavangar Marvasti, Z; Yaali-Jahromi, E; Azizi, M M; Morteza Hosseini, S; Badri, T",Ann Ig,,259

269496,Use of an electronic integral monitoring system for patients with diabetes to identify factors associated with an adequate glycemic goal and to measure quality of care,2020,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), has emerged as the cause of a global pandemic. We used RNA sequencing to analyze 286 nasopharyngeal (NP) swab and 53 whole-blood (WB) samples from 333 patients with COVID-19 and controls. Overall, a muted immune response was observed in COVID-19 relative to other infections (influenza, other seasonal coronaviruses, and bacterial sepsis), with paradoxical down-regulation of several key differentially expressed genes. Hospitalized patients and outpatients exhibited up-regulation of interferon-associated pathways, although heightened and more robust inflammatory responses were observed in hospitalized patients with more clinically severe illness. Two-layer machine learning-based host classifiers consisting of complete (>1000 genes), medium (<100), and small (<20) gene biomarker panels identified COVID-19 disease with 85.1-86.5% accuracy when benchmarked using an independent test set. SARS-CoV-2 infection has a distinct biosignature that differs between NP swabs and WB and can be leveraged for COVID-19 diagnosis.","Ng, Dianna L; Granados, Andrea C; Santos, Yale A; Servellita, Venice; Goldgof, Gregory M; Meydan, Cem; Sotomayor-Gonzalez, Alicia; Levine, Andrew G; Balcerek, Joanna; Han, Lucy M; Akagi, Naomi; Truong, Kent; Neumann, Neil M; Nguyen, David N; Bapat, Sagar P; Cheng, Jing; Martin, Claudia Sanchez-San; Federman, Scot; Foox, Jonathan; Gopez, Allan; Li, Tony; Chan, Ray; Chu, Cynthia S; Wabl, Chiara A; Gliwa, Amelia S; Reyes, Kevin; Pan, Chao-Yang; Guevara, Hugo; Wadford, Debra; Miller, Steve; Mason, Christopher E; Chiu, Charles Y",Sci.

269537,Evaluating intubation boxes for airway management,2020,"BACKGROUND: Limited pediatric cases with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been reported and the clinical profiles regarding COVID-19 in children remain obscure. Our aim was to investigate the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in children. METHODS: PUBMED and EMBASE were searched through 20 June 2020, for case reports and case series reporting pediatric COVID-19 cases. Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological data were collected and analyzed to compare by age. RESULTS: Our search identified 46 eligible case reports and case series. A total of 114 pediatric cases with COVID-19 were included. The main clinical features were mild symptoms including fever (64%), cough (35%), and rhinorrhea (16%), or no symptoms (15%). Ground-like opacities were common radiological findings (54%). The main laboratory findings were lymphopenia (33%) and elevated D-dimer (52%) and C-reactive protein (40%) levels. We identified 17 patients (15%) with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) manifesting with symptoms overlapping with, but distinct from, Kawasaki disease, including gastrointestinal symptoms, left ventricular systolic dysfunction, shock, and marked elevated inflammatory biomarkers. Twelve percent of the patients including 65% of the MIS-C cases required intensive care because of hypotension. No deaths were reported. CONCLUSION: This systematic review found that children with COVID-19 are generally less severe or asymptomatic. However, infants might be seriously ill and older children might develop MIS-C with severe illness. Early detection of children with mild symptoms or an asymptomatic state and early diagnosis of MIS-C are mandatory for the management of COVID-19 and the prevention of transmission and a severe inflammatory state.","Yasuhara, Jun; Kuno, Toshiki; Takagi, Hisato; Sumitomo, Naokata",Pediatr. pulmonol,,259
269558,Barriers to self-management of type 2 diabetes during covid-19 medical isolation: A qualitative study,2020,"BACKGROUND: So far, SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh coronavirus found to infect humans and cause disease with quite a strong infectivity. Patients diagnosed as severe or critical cases are prone to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, acute respiratory distress syndrome and even death. Proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 has been reported to be associated with the severity of disease and mortality in patients with COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review and meta-analysis were carried out to evaluate the association between IL-6 and severe disease and mortality in COVID-19 disease. METHODS: A systematic literature search using China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang databases, China Science and Technology Journal Database, Chinese Biomedical Literature, Embase, PubMed and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials was performed from inception until 16 January 2021. RESULTS: 12 studies reported the value of IL-6 for predicting the severe disease in patients with COVID-19. The pooled area under the curve (AUC) was 0.85 (95% CI 0.821 to 0.931). 5 studies elaborated the predictive value of IL-6 on mortality. The pooled sensitivity, specificity and AUC were 0.15 (95% CI 0.13 to 0.17, I2=98.9%), 0.73 (95% CI 0.65 to 0.79, I2=91.8%) and 0.531 (95% CI 0.451 to 0.612), respectively. Meta-regression analysis showed that country, technique used, cut-off, sample, study design and detection time did not contribute to the heterogeneity of mortality. CONCLUSION: IL-6 is an adequate predictor of severe disease in patients infected with the COVID-19. The finding of current study may guide clinicians and healthcare providers in identifying potentially severe or critical patients with COVID-19 at the initial stage of the disease. Moreover, we found that only monitoring IL-6 levels does not seem to predict mortality and was not associated with COVID-19's mortality.

271683,Liver function status in COVID-19: an Indian perspective,2021,"PURPOSES: Since a considerable number of health care workers (HCWs) were sent to Wuhan to aid COVID-19 control during the epidemic, non-frontline HCWs who stayed in local hospitals had to work overload to provide daily health care services for other health issues, which makes them more vulnerable to experience fatigue. Self-efficacy is suggested as a protective factor for fatigue. Nonetheless, less is known regarding the underlying mechanisms. This research aimed to explore the prevalence of fatigue among non-frontline HCWs during the pandemic, investigate the mediating effect of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and moderating effect of negative coping in the association between self-efficacy and fatigue. METHODS: General Self-Efficacy Scale, PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version, Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire and 14-item Fatigue Scale were administrated to 527 non-frontline HCWs from Anhui Province, China. The mediating effect was examined by Mackinnon's four-step procedure, while Hayes PROCESS macro was used to test the moderated mediation model. RESULTS: The prevalence of fatigue among non-frontline HCWs was 56.7%. The effect of self-efficacy on fatigue was partially mediated by PTSD symptoms (ab = -0.146, SE = 0.030, 95% CI = [-0.207, -0.095]). Additionally, negative coping moderated both the direct effect of self-efficacy on fatigue (ß = -0.158, P<0.001) and the mediating effect of PTSD symptoms (ß = 0.077, P = 0.008). When the standard score of negative coping increased to 1.49 and over, the direct association between self-efficacy and fatigue became insignificant. Likewise, the effect of self-efficacy on PTSD symptoms had no statistical significance when the standard score of negative coping was -1.40 and lower. CONCLUSIONS: More than half non-frontline HCWs suffered from fatigue during COVID-19. For those who tend to use negative coping, it might be crucial to design programs combining the enhancement of self-efficacy, preventions for PTSD symptoms and interventions for fatigue.","Hou, Tianya; Zhang, Ruike; Song, Xiangrui; Zhang, Fan; Cai, Wenpeng; Liu, Ying; Dong, Wei; Deng, Guanghui",PLoS One,,259
271931,Characteristics and Outcomes of Hospitalized Young Adults with Mild Covid -19,2020,"Aim. Studies on the changes in the presentation and management of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) during the COVID-19 pandemic from low- and middle-income countries are limited. We sought to determine the changes in the number of admissions, management practices, and outcomes of AMI during the pandemic period in India. Methods & Results. In this two-timepoint cross-sectional study involving 187 hospitals across India, patients admitted with AMI between 15th March to 15th June in 2020 were compared with those admitted during the corresponding period of 2019. We included 41,832 consecutive adults with AMI. Admissions during the pandemic period (n = 16414) decreased by 35·4% as compared to the corresponding period in 2019 (n = 25418). We observed significant heterogeneity in this decline across India. The weekly average decrease in AMI admissions in 2020 correlated negatively with the number of COVID cases (r = -0·48;r2 = 0·2), but strongly correlated with the stringency of lockdown index (r = 0·95;r2 = 0·90). On a multi-level logistic regression, admissions were lower in 2020 with older age categories, tier 1 cities, and centers with high patient volume. Adjusted utilization rate of coronary angiography, and percutaneous coronary intervention decreased by 11·3%, and 5·9% respectively. Conclusions. The magnitude of reduction in AMI admissions across India was not uniform. The nature, time course, and the patient demographics were different compared to reports from other countries, suggesting a significant impact due to the lockdown. These findings have important implications in managing AMI during the pandemic.","Zachariah, Geevar Ramakrishnan Sivasubramanian Das Mrinal Kanti Jabir Abdullakutty Balagopalan Jayagopal Pathiyil Nair Venugopal Krishnan Mani Kalaivani Khan Amal Kumar Malviya Amit Gupta Anshul Goyal Ashok Singh Bateshwar Prasad Mohan Bishav Bharti Bishwa Bhushan Majumder Biswajit Wilson Bivin Karunadas Chakkalakkal Prabhakaran Meena Chandra Bhan Manjunath Cholenahally Nanjappa Mathew Cibu Roy Debabrata Choudhary Dinesh Das Dipak Ranjan Sarma Diapk Palleda Girish Meennahalli Wander Gurpreet Singh Wardhan Harsh Ezhilan Janakiraman Tummala Karthik Kumar Katyal Virender Goswami Kewal Subramanyam Kodangala Goyal Krishna Kishore Kenchappa Kumar Pathak Lekha Adik Bansal Manish Mandal Manoranjan Gupta Mohit Dayal Khanna Narendranath Hanumanthappa Natesh Bangalore Bardoloi Neil Modi Nitin Naik Nitish Hasija Pradeep K.; Kerkar, Prafulla Bhattacharyya Pranab Jyoti Gadkari Pushkraj Chakraborthy Rabindra Nath Patil Rahul Raosaheb Gupta Rakesh Yadav Rakesh Murty Rambhatla Suryanarayana Nath Ranjit Kumar Sivakumar Rathinavel Sethi Rishi Baruah Rituparna Tyagi Sanjay Guha Santanu Krishnappa Santhosh Kumar Satish Routray Satyanarayan Tiwari Satyendra Ray Saumitra Reddy Seemala Saikrishna Chandra Sharad Gupta Shashi Bhushan Chatterjee Shashi Shekhar Kkh Siddiqui Maduramuthu Sivabalan Yerram Sreekanth Kumar Sudeep Nagarajan Swaminathan Devasia Tom Jadhav Uday Narain Varun Shankar Garg Vijay Kumar Gupta Vitull K.; Prabhakaran, Dorairaj Deb Pradip Kumar Mohanan Padinhare Purayil",Indian Heart Journal,,259

METHODS: We used data from the UK Biobank. Multivariable-adjusted logistic regression was employed in the following analyses: analysis A, to test for association between gout and/or RA and COVID-19 diagnosis (n = 473,139); analysis B, to test for association between gout and/or RA and death from COVID-19 in a case-control cohort of people who died of or survived COVID-19 (n = 2059); analysis C, to test for association between gout and/or RA and death from COVID-19 in the entire UK Biobank cohort (n = 473,139). RESULTS: RA, but not gout, was associated with COVID-19 diagnosis in analysis A. Neither RA nor gout was associated with risk of death in the group diagnosed with COVID-19 in analysis B. However, RA was associated with risk of death related to COVID-19 by using the UK Biobank cohort in analysis C, independent of comorbidities and other measured risk factors (odds ratio [OR] 1.9; 95% confidence interval CI 1.2-3.0). Gout was not associated with death related to COVID-19 in the same UK Biobank analysis (OR 1.2; 95% CI 0.8-1.7). CONCLUSION: RA is a risk factor for death from COVID-19 by using the UK Biobank cohort.

275938,Giant inverted T waves in a patient with COVID-19 infection,2020,"Different from Visual Question Answering task that requires to answer only one question about an image, Visual Dialogue task involves multiple rounds of dialogues which cover a broad range of visual content that could be related to any objects, relationships or high-level semantics. Thus one of the key challenges in Visual Dialogue task is to learn a more comprehensive and semantic-rich image representation that can adaptively attend to the visual content referred by variant questions. In this paper, we first propose a novel scheme to depict an image from both visual and semantic views. Specifically, the visual view aims to capture the appearance-level information in an image, including objects and their visual relationships, while the semantic view enables the agent to understand high-level visual semantics from the whole image to the local regions. Furthermore, on top of such dual-view image representations, we propose a Dual Encoding Visual Dialogue (DualVD) module, which is able to adaptively select question-relevant information from the visual and semantic views in a hierarchical mode. To demonstrate the effectiveness of DualVD, we propose two novel visual dialogue models by applying it to the Late Fusion framework and Memory Network framework. The proposed models achieve state-of-the-art results on three benchmark datasets. A critical advantage of the DualVD module lies in its interpretability. We can analyze which modality (visual or semantic) has more contribution in answering the current question by explicitly visualizing the gate values. It gives us insights in understanding of information selection mode in the Visual Dialogue task.

278930,Estimated Use of Intensive Care Beds Due to COVID-19 in Germany Over Time,2020,"COVID-19 is a global pandemic with uncertain death rates. We examined county-level population morality rates (per 100,000) and case fatality rates by US region and rural-urban classification, while controlling for demographic, socioeconomic, and hospital variables. We found that population mortality rates and case fatality rates were significantly different across region, rural-urban classification, and their interaction. All significant comparisons had p < 0.001. Northeast counties had the highest population mortality rates (27.4) but had similar case fatality rates (5.9%) compared to other regions except the Southeast, which had significantly lower rates (4.1%). Population mortality rates were highest in urban counties but conversely, case fatality rates were highest in rural counties. Death rates in the Northeast were driven by urban areas (e.g., small, East Coast states), while case fatality rates tended to be highest in the most rural counties for all regions, especially the Southwest. However, on further inspection, high case fatality rate percentages in the Southwest, as well as in overall US counties, were driven by a low case number. This makes it hard to distinguish genuinely higher mortality or an artifact of a small sample size. In summary, coronavirus deaths are not homogenous across the United States but instead vary by region and population and highlight the importance of fine-scale analysis.","Ahmed, Rashid; Williamson, Mark; Hamid, Muhammad Akhter; Ashraf, Naila",,,259

Our pragmatic approach combining clinical and quantitative RT-PCR data could aid assessment of COVID-19 reinfection or reactivation by clinicians and public health personnel.","Peltan, Ithan D; Beesley, Sarah J; Webb, Brandon J; Lopansri, Bert K; Sinclair, Will; Jacobs, Jason R; Brown, Samuel M",PLoS One,,259

The choroid was imaged with enhanced depth imaging (EDI) techniques using SD-OCT. CT was measured, subfoveal, at 1000 µm nasal and temporal of the center of the fovea. Measurements were first made after wearing the N95 mask for at least 2 h without removing it and repeated 15 min after removing. RESULTS: After 2 h of the N95 mask using without removal, the mean subfoveal CT was 293.56 ± 76.12(min:185, max:479), the mean temporal CT was 253.81 ± 63.48(min:172, max:384), the mean nasal CT was 239.18 ± 53.92(min:139, max:356). Fifteen minutes after removal of the N95 mask, the mean subfoveal CT was 250.56 ± 52.48(min:172, max:397), the mean temporal was 218.40 ± 53.58(min:129, max:354), the mean nasal CT was 210.67 ± 53.31(min:132, max:366). The differences in subfoveal, temporal and nasal CT between 2 h of N95 mask use and 15 min after removal of the mask were statistically significant (p < 0.05 for each). CONCLUSION: Hypercapnia due to prolonged use of the N95 mask may cause choroidal hemodynamic changes and transient increased choroidal thickness.","Karatas Durusoy, Gonul; Gumus, Gulsah; Demir, Gokhan",Photodiagnosis Photodyn Ther,,259

We therefore ask how individual labor market experiences are related to the development of mental health complaints in the spring of 2020. As clinical data collection was compromised during the lockdowns, standardized surveys of the European labor force provide an opportunity to observe mental health complaints as the crisis unfolded. Data are representative of active members of the labor force of six European nations that contained varying levels of COVID-19 burdens in terms of mortality and lockdown measures. We document a steep occupational prestige level gradient on the probability of facing economic hardship during the lockdowns-looming job loss, income loss, and workload decline-which evidently exacerbate socioeconomic inequalities. Analyses indicate a striking positive relationship between instantaneous economic hardships during the COVID-19 lockdown and expressing feelings of depression and health anxiety. Importantly, the magnitude of the association between such hardships and indicators of mental health deterioration is highly dependent on workers' occupational standing, revealing a second layer of exacerbating inequality.","Witteveen, Dirk; Velthorst, Eva",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,,259

300733,Understanding the Impact of COVID-19: Now and for the Future,2021,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the sensitivity of alternative case-finding approaches for the identification of foot osteoarthritis (OA) based on the La Trobe radiographic atlas. METHODS: Cross-sectional study of 533 adults aged &#8805;50 years with foot pain in the past year. Weightbearing dorso-plantar (DP) and lateral x-rays were taken of both feet. The La Trobe radiographic atlas was used to document the presence of osteophytes (OP) and joint space narrowing (JSN). Prevalence of OA in each joint was documented using both views and features in combination (as recommended in the original atlas), and by using a single view (DP or lateral only) and a single feature (OP or JSN only). RESULTS: Compared to the recommended case definition based on OP and JSN using both views, a DP only view identified between 15 and 77% of OA cases, while a lateral only view identified between 28 and 97% of OA cases. Compared to the recommended case definition of using both features, using only OP identified between 46 and 94% of OA cases, while using only JSN identified between 19 and 76% of OA cases. CONCLUSION: Applying the La Trobe radiographic atlas but using only one x-ray view (DP or lateral) or one feature (OP or JSN) in isolation misses a substantial number of OA cases, and the sensitivity of these approaches varies considerably between different foot joints. These findings indicate that, where possible, the atlas should be administered according to the original description to avoid under-ascertainment of radiographic foot OA.","Menz, Hylton B; Munteanu, Shannon E; Marshall, Michelle; Thomas, Martin J; Rathod-Mistry, Trishna; Peat, George M; Roddy, Edward",Arthritis care &amp; research (2010 : Online),,259

302037,Validation of pneumonia prognostic scores in a statewide cohort of hospitalized patients with COVID-19,2020,"At the end of 2019, the new coronavirus caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) suddenly raged, bringing a severe public health crisis to the world. It is urgent to discover suitable drugs and treatment regimens against this coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and related diseases. Based on the previous knowledge and experience in treating similar diseases, researchers have come up with hundreds of possible drug candidates in the shortest possible time. Based on surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technology, this review summarized the application of SPR technology in COVID-19 research from four aspects: the invasion mode of SARS-CoV-2 into host cells, antibody drug candidates for the treatment of COVID-19, small molecule drug repurposing and vaccines for COVID-19. SPR technology has gradually become a powerful tool to study the interaction between drugs and targets due to its high efficiency, automation, labeling-free and high data resolution. The use of SPR technology can not only obtain the affinity data between drugs and targets, but also clarify the binding sites and mechanisms of drugs. We hope that this review can provide a reference for the subsequent application of SPR technology in antiviral drug development.","Wang, Qian Liu Zhenming",European Journal of Medicinal Chemistry Reports,,259
303409,We Need Blood and I Am Not Allowed to Help,2020,"BACKGROUND: Patient-centered outcomes research (PCOR) engages patients as partners in research and focuses on questions and outcomes that are important to patients. The COVID-19 pandemic has forced PCOR teams to engage through web-based platforms rather than in person. Similarly, virtual engagement is the only safe alternative for members of the cystic fibrosis (CF) community, who spend their lives following strict infection control guidelines and are already restricted from in-person interactions. In the absence of universal best practices, the CF community has developed its own guidelines to help PCOR teams engage through web-based platforms. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify the important attributes, facilitators, and barriers to teams when selecting web-based platforms. METHODS: We conducted semistructured interviews with CF community members, nonprofit stakeholders, and researchers to obtain information regarding their experience with using web-based platforms, including the effectiveness and efficiency of these platforms and their satisfaction with and confidence while using each platform. Interviews conducted via Zoom were audio recorded and transcribed. We identified key themes through content analysis with an iterative, inductive, and deductive coding process. RESULTS: In total, 15 participants reported using web-based platforms for meetings, project management, document sharing, scheduling, and communication. When selecting web-based platforms, participants valued their accessibility, ease of use, and integration with other platforms. Participants speculated that successful web-based collaboration involved platforms that emulate in-person interactions, recognized the digital literacy levels of the team members, intentionally aligned platforms with collaboration goals, and achieved team member buy-in to adopt new platforms. CONCLUSIONS: Successful web-based engagement in PCOR requires the use of multiple platforms in order to fully meet the asynchronous or synchronous goals of the project. This study identified the key attributes for the successful practice of PCOR on web-based platforms and the common challenges and solutions associated with their use. Our findings provide the best practices for selecting platforms and the lessons learned through web-based PCOR collaborations.","Thayer, Erin K; Pam, Molly; Al Achkar, Morhaf; Mentch, Laura; Brown, Georgia; Kazmerski, Traci M; Godfrey, Emily",J Particip Med,,259

305697,Normal weight obesity and COVID-19 severity: A poorly recognized link,2020,"Background: Studies have found different waning rates of neutralising antibodies compared with binding antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. The impact of neutralising antibody waning rate at the individual patient level on the longevity of immunity remains unknown. We aimed to investigate the peak levels and dynamics of neutralising antibody waning and IgG avidity maturation over time, and correlate this with clinical parameters, cytokines, and T-cell responses. Methods: We did a longitudinal study of patients who had recovered from COVID-19 up to day 180 post-symptom onset by monitoring changes in neutralising antibody levels using a previously validated surrogate virus neutralisation test. Changes in antibody avidities and other immune markers at different convalescent stages were determined and correlated with clinical features. Using a machine learning algorithm, temporal change in neutralising antibody levels was classified into five groups and used to predict the longevity of neutralising antibody-mediated immunity. Findings: We approached 517 patients for participation in the study, of whom 288 consented for outpatient follow-up and collection of serial blood samples. 164 patients were followed up and had adequate blood samples collected for analysis, with a total of 546 serum samples collected, including 128 blood samples taken up to 180 days post-symptom onset. We identified five distinctive patterns of neutralising antibody dynamics as follows: negative, individuals who did not, at our intervals of sampling, develop neutralising antibodies at the 30% inhibition level (19 [12%] of 164 patients); rapid waning, individuals who had varying levels of neutralising antibodies from around 20 days after symptom onset, but seroreverted in less than 180 days (44 [27%] of 164 patients); slow waning, individuals who remained neutralising antibody-positive at 180 days post-symptom onset (52 [29%] of 164 patients); persistent, although with varying peak neutralising antibody levels, these individuals had minimal neutralising antibody decay (52 [32%] of 164 patients); and delayed response, a small group that showed an unexpected increase of neutralising antibodies during late convalescence (at 90 or 180 days after symptom onset; three [2%] of 164 patients). Persistence of neutralising antibodies was associated with disease severity and sustained level of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors. By contrast, T-cell responses were similar among the different neutralising antibody dynamics groups. On the basis of the different decay dynamics, we established a prediction algorithm that revealed a wide range of neutralising antibody longevity, varying from around 40 days to many decades. Interpretation: Neutralising antibody response dynamics in patients who have recovered from COVID-19 vary greatly, and prediction of immune longevity can only be accurately determined at the individual level. Our findings emphasise the importance of public health and social measures in the ongoing pandemic outbreak response, and might have implications for longevity of immunity after vaccination.

305750,"Response to comments to ""Open versus percutaneous tracheostomy in COVID-19: a multicentre comparison and recommendationfor future resource utilisation""",2021,"The outbreak of COVI-19 and the restrictive measures on the mobility of people in Brazil have raised serious concerns about the survival and recovery of passenger transport companies, especially those that generate public agglomerations. There are some policy proposals that aim to recover this set of sectors in the face of the adverse effects of the COVID-19 outbreak. This study contributes to this debate in course and analyzes the economic effects of two scenarios of recovery for this type of transport services in the Brazilian economy up to the end of 2022: (i) one with a 50% recovery until the end of 2021 and (ii) another with a 50% sectorial recovery until June 2022. This distinction allows us to assess the impact of the speed of recovery. In both scenarios, we also consider likely changes in the labor market, family preferences, and government spending. To accomplish this task, we developed a dynamic computable general equilibrium model that recognizes a Social Accounting Matrix (SAM) and has details of the transport sectors. The main findings suggest that the drop in these transport services is the main contributing factor to the decline in the Brazilian GDP growth (-2.2%) in the period of social distance measures. However, faster recovery of these sectors can generate a marginal effect of 0.5 percentage points on GDP at the end of 2021. In the recovery period, due to the redistributive effects of income, the family demand for public transport is expected to grow post- COVID-19 outbreak, while the demand for private transport is reduced, especially in the basket of goods of the poorest households. Vehicle, bus, and aircraft manufacture seems sensitive to the recovery time of the demand for transport services with public agglomerations.","Betarelli Junior, Admir Antonio Faria Weslem Rodrigues Proque Andressa Lemes Perobelli Fernando Salgueiro de Almeida Vale Vinicius",Transport Policy,,259

All medical specialties including gastroenterology are impacted by COVID-19. Here, we review the bidirectional comorbidity of chronic gastrointestinal (GI) disorders and COVID-19, including the incidence and outcome of COVID-19 in individuals with various GI disorders and the impact of COVID-19 on the course and outcome of the underlying (or comorbid) GI disorders. Currently, there is no evidence that COVID-19 is more (or less) frequent in comorbid GI disorders. It is also reassuring that the outcome of COVID-19 is unaffected by the underlying GI disorder or its treatment, though potential concerns remain in regard to the use of immunomodulatory treatments in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and liver transplant recipients. Despite these concerns, there is now agreement among experts that ongoing immunomodulatory treatments may not be interrupted in individuals with IBD during the COVID-19 pandemic. Caution, however, may be exercised with the use of corticosteroids in the management of IBD. In addition, COVID-19 does not appear to impact the manifestations, course, outcome, and treatment of comorbid GI disorders, e.g. IBD. Decompensation of liver cirrhosis is, however, possible during COVID-19 episodes. A direct concern, however, might relate to the potential transmission of the virus through fecal microbiota transplants.","Baryah, Amol Nanak Singh; Midha, Vandana; Mahajan, Ramit; Sood, Ajit",Indian J Gastroenterol,,259

The situation caused by the rapidly increasing number of new cases and deaths due to COVID-19 required the rapid development of international recommendations and procedures to limit the spread of infections and ongoing monitoring of the epidemiological situation. In the field of epidemiological surveillance of COVID-19 cases, international organizations - WHO and regionally ECDC, have developed basic requirements for reporting data on newly detected cases of infection. In order to ensure the possibility of reporting new cases and activities undertaken by sanitary-epidemiological services in the country and to fulfill the obligation to report data to the European surveillance network, it was necessary to adapt the electronic system supporting epidemiological surveillance operations, for registration of suspected and confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections. This work presents the characteristics of the new COVID-19 module created as part of the central Epidemiological Case Reporting System and a preliminary evaluation of its usefulness for the purposes of combating COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS. The Epidemiological Case Reporting System is an efficient and adequate tool that can be adapted to newly emerging threats. In order to use the module to monitor the current epidemiological situation, it is necessary to integrate it with other systems collecting data about COVID-19 patients - ie.

METHODS: This study is a partial economic evaluation and a cross-sectional cost-description study conducted based on the data of the COVID-19 patients referred to a referral university hospital in Fars province between March and July 2020. The data were collected by examining the patients' records and accounting information systems. The subjects included all the inpatients with COVID-19 (477 individuals) who admitted to the medical centre during the 4 months. Bottom-up costing (also called micro-costing approach), incidence-based and income-based human capital approaches were used as the main methodological features of this study. RESULTS: The direct medical costs were estimated to be 28,240,025,968 Rials ($ 1,791,172) in total with mean cost of 59,203,409 Rials ($ 3755) per person (SD = 4684 $/ 73,855,161 Rials) in which significant part (41%) was that of intensive and general care beds (11,596,217,487 Rials equal to $ 735,510 (M = 24,310,728 Rials or $ 1542, SD = 34,184,949 Rials or $ 2168(. The second to which were the costs of medicines and medical consumables (28%). The mean indirect costs, including income loss due to premature death, economic production loss due to hospitalization and job absenteeism during recovery course were estimated to be 129,870,974 Rials ($ 11,634) per person.

The quarantine is the most effective way to slow the spread of disease and “Flatting of Curve” is a phenomenon to tackle the surge by health systems. To achieve good results from existing Medical Health Care Systems (MHCS), an accurate prediction for the spread of disease is crucial. This study utilizes the generalized method of SIR to accurately predict the spread of COVID-19 associated infection, recoveries, and deaths in Pakistan. The data from the National Command and Control of Pakistan (NCCP) is utilized.

The objective of this work was to analyze the consequences of the pandemic on liver transplantation in general and for hepatocarcinoma (HCC). The following studies were carried out: (a) a retrospective analysis using data from the CRESI/INCUCAI to compare admission to the waiting list, mortality on the list, donation and liver transplantation from 03/20 to 08/15, 2019 and the same period in 2020, and (b) a survey of the transplant centers with the highest transplant activity to assess the effect of the measures taken in different institutional and regional situations. The first analysis showed a 55% decrease in liver transplants, with a similar reduction in donation and admission to the liver waiting list;while HCC transplantation rose from 10% in 2019 to 22% in 2020. The second analysis showed that the occupancy rate of beds by COVID-19 patients/week was variable: from 0.4% to 42.0%. The number of surgeries, hepato-bilio-pancreatic, resection of HCC and liver transplantation, were reduced by 47%, 49%, 31% and 36% respectively.

319466,Practice recommendations for risk-adapted head and neck cancer radiotherapy during the COVID-19 pandemic: An ASTRO-ESTRO consensus statement,2020,"BACKGROUND: As in many fields of medical care, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) resulted in an increased uncertainty regarding the safety of allergen immunotherapy (AIT). Therefore, the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) aimed to analyze the situation in different countries and systematically collect all information available regarding tolerability and possible amendments in daily practice of sublingual AIT (SLIT), subcutaneous AIT (SCIT) for inhalant allergies and venom AIT. METHOD: Under the framework of the EAACI, a panel of experts in the field of AIT coordinated by the Immunotherapy Interest Group (IT IG) set-up a web-based retrospective survey (SurveyMonkey®) including 27 standardized questions on practical and safety aspects on AIT in worldwide clinical routine. RESULTS: 417 respondents providing AIT to their patients in daily routine answered the survey. For patients (without any current symptoms to suspect COVID-19), 60% of the respondents informed of not having initiated SCIT (40% venom AIT, 35% SLIT) whereas for the maintenance phase of AIT, SCIT was performed by 75% of the respondents (74% venom AIT, 89% SLIT). No tolerability concern arises from this preliminary analysis. 16 physicians reported having performed AIT despite (early) symptoms of COVID-19 and/or a positive test result for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). CONCLUSIONS: This first international retrospective survey in atopic diseases investigated practical aspects and tolerability of AIT during the COVID-19 pandemic and gave no concerns regarding reduced tolerability under real-life circumstances. However, the data indicate an undertreatment of AIT, which may be temporary, but could have a long-lasting negative impact on the clinical care of allergic patients.","Pfaar, Oliver; Agache, Ioana; Bonini, Matteo; Brough, Helen Annaruth; Chivato, Tomás; Del Giacco, Stefano R; Gawlik, Radoslaw; Gelincik, Asli; Hoffmann-Sommergruber, Karin; Jutel, Marek; Klimek, Ludger; Knol, Edward F; Lauerma, Antti; Ollert, Markus; O039,; Mahony, Liam; Mortz, Charlotte G; Palomares, Oscar; Riggioni, Carmen; Schwarze, Jürgen; Skypala, Isabel; Torres, María José; Untersmayr, Eva; Walusiak-Skorupa, Jolanta; Chaker, Adam; Giovannini, Mattia; Heffler, Enrico; Jensen-Jarolim, Erika; Quecchia, Cristina; Sandoval-Ruballos, Mónica; Sahiner, Umit; Tomic Spiric, Vesna; Alvaro-Lozano, Montserrat",Allergy,,259

It argues that while the use of military metaphors can usefully and desirably function to mobilize widespread acceptance and compliance with the relevant legislative measures and to motivate action, the use of metaphors in this way should nonetheless be viewed with caution. Metaphors of war and associated images are emotionally powerful and can function in a way that makes it difficult to question governmental responses and responsibility.","Gillis, Matilda",Law and Humanities,,259

Here, we aim to identify a new panel of biomarkers including IgG subclasses, Rheumatoid Factor (RF), and Free Light Chains (FLC) that may result useful and reliable for clinical evaluation of HBV-related cryoglobulinemia. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed clinical data from 44 HBV positive patients. Patients were stratified on the presence/absence of mixed cryoglobulinemia in two group: 22 with cryoglobulins (CGs) and 22 without CGs. Samples from 20 healthy blood donors (HD) were used as negative controls. Serum samples were tested for IgG subclasses, RF (IgM, IgG, and IgA type), and FLC. RESULTS: We detected a strikingly different serum IgG subclasses distribution between HD and HBV positive patients together with different RF isotypes; FLC were significantly increased in HBV-patients if compared with HD while no significant difference was shown between HBV with/without MC. CONCLUSION: The immune-inflammatory response triggered by HBV may be monitored by a peculiar profile of biomarkers.

Classes were moved online, students had to leave dorms and move; they had to forgo regular meetings with their peers. Subsequently, a vital demand for examining students' mental health emerged. The data were collected at a time when universities in Poland were under lockdowns. Participants represented students of many different fields of study. The General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28) was used. Student's subjective evaluation of online learning and their adaptation to academic life shifts were reviewed. A total of 1123 participants took part in this study. Relationship analysis included tests, such as U Mann-Whitney, appropriate for specific variables. The impact of variables connected with the pandemic on the GHQ scores was tested using multivariate regression analysis. The results were considered significant at a p-value set at 0.05. Overall, 76.96% of the participants manifested psychopathological symptoms measured by the GHQ. Four demographical variables were possibly associated with the GHQ scores: female sex, living in a big city, necessity to move back home, and being in a relationship. Negative correlations between subjective evaluation of variables concerning e-learning, such as its efficiency or quality, and the GHQ scores were found. Some variables were found to be potential protective factors, whereas others could have contributed to worsened mental health. The study provides data on students' worsened mental health due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the shifts in academic life it caused. Therefore, recommendations for early psychosocial interventions among students are strongly advised.","Wieczorek, Tomasz; Kolodziejczyk, Agata; Ciulkowicz, Marta; Maciaszek, Julian; Misiak, Blazej; Rymaszewska, Joanna; Szczesniak, Dorota",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,259

METHODS: In this retrospective longitudinal study, we monitored the serum lipids in 17 surviving and 4 non-surviving COVID-19 cases prior to their viral infections and duration the entire disease courses. RESULTS: In surviving cases, the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels decreased significantly on admission as compared with the levels before infection; the LDL levels remained constantly low during the disease progression and resumed to the original levels when patients recovered (pre-infection: 3.5 (3.0-4.4); on admission: 2.8 (2.3-3.1), pâ¯<â¯0.01; progression: 2.5 (2.3-3.0); discharge: 3.6 (2.7-4.1); median (IQR), in mmol/L). In non-surviving patients, LDL levels showed an irreversible and continuous decrease until death (1.1 (0.9-1.2), pâ¯=â¯0.02 versus the levels on admission). The ratio changes of LDL levels inversely correlated with ratio changes of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels. Logistic regression analysis showed increasing odds of lowered LDL levels associated with disease progression (odds ratio: 4.48, 95% IC: 1.55-12.92, pâ¯=â¯0.006) and in-hospital death (odds ratio: 21.72, 95% IC: 1.40-337.54, pâ¯=â¯0.028).

However, exerting self-control, which is essential for successful abstinence from drug addiction, can cause ego depletion. This study experimentally investigated the effect of ego depletion on interpersonal trust and examined possible changes in the ego depletion effect across different abstinence periods. This study employed a 2 (ego depletion: high vs. low) × 2 (partners: non-SUD vs. SUD) mixed factorial design. The participants were 273 male individuals with SUD and with periods of drug abstinence ranging from several days to 2 years, who resided in a compulsory drug rehabilitation center. The participants were first asked to complete an ego depletion task, followed by a decision-making task in a trust game, first with a non-SUD stranger, and then with a SUD stranger. Ego depletion was not related to trust in non-SUD strangers. However, ego depleted participants were more likely to trust SUD strangers than non-ego depleted participants. Moreover, this ego depletion effect fluctuated near the end of SUD treatment. This study highlights the importance to ensure follow-up outpatient care and offer social support services for individuals with SUD after compulsory SUD treatment.","Liu, Chang-Jiang; Hao, Fang",J Psychoactive Drugs,,259

That led to an increased clothing insulation which is negatively affecting the perceived healthcare workers' thermal sensation. OBJECTIVES: While demonstrating through software simulations the potential level of thermal discomfort healthcare workers involved in the COVID-19 emergency can be subjected to, this work aims at identifying measures to improve thermal sensation perception and acceptable thermal conditions for medical personnel. METHODS: After having obtained the insulation values of individual clothing used by staff during COVID-19 emergency through the use of a thermal well-being evaluation software, the Fanger indexes (PMV - Predicted Mean Vote and PPD - Predicted Percentage of Dissatisfied) were calculated in order to estimate staff satisfaction to microclimatic conditions. RESULTS: The use of COVID-19 additional PPEs with an air temperature equal to 22 °C (normally considered optimal) brings the PMV index equal to 0.6, which corresponds to 11.8 % being unsatisfied (PPD) due to perceived heat. DISCUSSION: The use of additional protective devices significantly increases the clothing insulation level, facilitating the onset of conditions of thermal discomfort in the health workers. Workers engaged in the execution of nasopharyngeal swabs were most affected by the summer weather conditions and certainly represent the most critical category, for which it would be recommended to implement a higher turnover of service to reduce individual exposure time and consequent discomfort.","Lembo, Marco; Vedetta, Carmela; Moscato, Umberto; Del Gaudio, Michele",Med Lav,,259

Despite the widespread use of metformin, there is considerable variation in treatment response; with approximately one-third of patients failing to achieve adequate glycemic control. Studies have reported the involvement of single nucleotide polymorphisms and their interactions in genetic pathways i.e., pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics. This study aims to investigate the association between 19 pharmacogenetics biomarkers and response to metformin treatment. Methods MassARRAY panels were designed and optimized by Inqaba Biotechnical Industries, to genotype 19 biomarkers for 140 type 2 diabetic outpatients. Results The CT genotype of the rs12752688 polymorphism was significantly associated with increased response to metformin therapy after correction (OR=0.33, 95% CI [0.16-0.68], p-value=0.006). An association was also found between the GA genotype of SLC47A2 rs12943590 and a decreased response to metformin therapy after correction (OR=2.29, 95% CI [1.01-5.21], p-value=0.01). Conclusions This is the first study investigating the association between genetic variants and responsiveness to medication for diabetic patients from the indigenous Nguni population in South Africa.

However, the success rate of immune checkpoint blockade is still low and some cancers, such as microsatellite-stable colorectal cancer, remain refractory to these treatments. This has prompted investigation into additional checkpoint receptors. T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain 3 (Tim-3) is a checkpoint receptor expressed by a wide variety of immune cells as well as leukemic stem cells. Coblockade of Tim-3 and PD-1 can result in reduced tumor progression in preclinical models and can improve antitumor T-cell responses in cancer patients. In this review, we will discuss the basic biology of Tim-3, its role in the tumor microenvironment, and the emerging clinical trial data that point to its future application in the field of immune-oncology.","Acharya, Nandini; Sabatos-Peyton, Catherine; Anderson, Ana Carrizosa",J. immunotherap. cancer,,259

Different modelling techniques have been used to predict and simulate the spread of COVID-19, but they have not always been useful for epidemiologists and decision-makers. To improve the reliability of the modelling results, it is very important to critically evaluate the data used and to check whether or not due regard has been paid to the different ways in which the disease spreads through the population. As building an epidemiological model that is reliable enough and suits the current epidemiological situation within a country or region, certain criteria must be met in the modelling process. It might be necessary to use a combination of two or more different types of models in order to cover all aspects of epidemic modelling. If we want epidemiological models to be a useful tool in combating the epidemic, we need to engage experts from epidemiology, data science and statistics.","Eržen, Ivan; Kamenšek, Tina; Fošnarič, Miha; Žibert, Janez",Zdravstveno Varstvo,,259

The research samples included 214 companies, which were divided proportionally into nine sectors or 49 sub-sectors. Data analysis used was the Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test. The results show an increase in the leverage ratio and short-term activity ratio but a decrease in the public companies' liquidity ratio and profitability ratio during the COVID-19 pandemic. There was no significant difference in the liquidity ratio and leverage ratio. However, the public companies' profitability ratio and short-term activity ratio differed significantly between before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. The sector that experienced an increase in liquidity ratio, profitability ratio, and short-term activity ratio but a decrease in the leverage ratio was the consumer goods sector. In contrast, the sectors experiencing a decrease in the liquidity and profitability ratios were property, real estate and building construction, finance, trade, services, and investment sectors.","Masdiantini, Putu Riesty; Devi, Sunitha; Musmini, Lucy Sri; Warasniasih, Ni Made Sindy","Journal Of Economics, Business, &amp; Accountancy Ventura",,259

Using interview data with victims, online observation, and the data mining of media reports, this paper investigated the changing targets of stigma from the outbreak of Covid-19 to early April 2020 when China had largely contained the first wave of Covid-19 within its border. We found that at the early stage of the pandemic, stigma was inflicted by some non-Hubei Chinese population onto Wuhan and Hubei residents, by some Hong Kong and Taiwan residents onto mainland Chinese, and by some Westerners towards overseas Chinese. With the number of cases outside China surpassing that in China, stigmatization was imposed by some Chinese onto Africans in China. We further explore how various factors, such as the fear of infection, food and mask culture, political ideology, and racism, affected the stigmatization of different victim groups. This study not only improved our understanding of how stigmatization happened in the Chinese-speaking world amid Covid-19 but also contributes to the literature of how sociopolitical factors may affect the production of hate crimes.","Xu, Jianhua; Sun, Guyu; Cao, Wei; Fan, Wenyuan; Pan, Zhihao; Yao, Zhaoyu; Li, Han",Asian J Criminol,,259

335049,Why is mock care not a good proxy for predicting hand contamination during patient care?,2020,"Vulnerable populations have been identified as having higher infection rates and poorer COVID-19–related outcomes, likely due to their inability to readily access primary care, follow public health directives, and adhere to self-isolation guidelines. As a response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many health care services have adopted new digital solutions, which rely on phone and internet connectivity. However, persons who are digitally inaccessible, such as those experiencing poverty or homelessness, are often unable to use these services. In response to this newly highlighted social disparity known as “digital health inequity,” emergency physicians at the University Health Network in Toronto, Canada, initiated a program called PHONE-CONNECT (Phones for Healthier Ontarians iN EDs – COvid NEeds met by Cellular Telephone). This novel approach attempts to improve patients’ access to health care, information, and social services, as well as improve their ability to adhere to public health directives (social isolation and contact tracing). Although similar programs addressing the same emerging issues have been recently described in the media, this is the first time phones have been provided as a health care intervention in an emergency department. This innovative emergency department point-of-care intervention may have a significant impact on improving health outcomes for vulnerable people during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.","Gill, Kazevman Mercado Marck Hulme Jennifer Somers Andrea",Journal of Medical Internet Research,,259
339086,Black fungus and COVID-19: role of otorhinolaryngologists and audiologists,2021,"Rapid diagnosis is critical for the treatment and prevention of diseases. An advanced nanomaterial-based biosensing platform that detects COVID-19 antibodies within seconds is reported. The biosensing platform is created by 3D nanoprinting of three-dimensional electrodes, coating the electrodes by nanoflakes of reduced-graphene-oxide (rGO), and immobilizing specific viral antigens on the rGO nanoflakes. The electrode is then integrated with a microfluidic device and used in a standard electrochemical cell. When antibodies are introduced on the electrode surface, they selectively bind with the antigens, changing the impedance of the electrical circuit which is detected via impedance spectroscopy. Antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 protein and its receptor-binding-domain (RBD) are detected at a limit-of-detection of 2.8 × 10-15 and 16.9 × 10-15 m, respectively, and read by a smartphone-based user interface. The sensor can be regenerated within a minute by introducing a low-pH chemistry that elutes the antibodies from the antigens, allowing successive sensing of test samples using the same sensor. Sensing of S1 and RBD antibodies is specific, which cross-reacts neither with other antibodies such as RBD, S1, and nucleocapsid antibody nor with proteins such as interleukin-6. The proposed sensing platform could also be useful to detect biomarkers for other infectious agents such as Ebola, HIV, and Zika.","Ali, Md Azahar; Hu, Chunshan; Jahan, Sanjida; Yuan, Bin; Saleh, Mohammad Sadeq; Ju, Enguo; Gao, Shou-Jiang; Panat, Rahul",Adv Mater,,259

AIMS: An audit aimed to evaluate NHS research staff's experiences of redeployment in order to provide suggestions for future improvements in the process. METHODS: A questionnaire was disseminated to all staff in the clinical research directorate of an NHS trust. Responses were analysed using thematic analysis. FINDINGS: Over half the redeployed staff experienced perceived negative psychological outcomes. The main reported contributor to this was perceived lack of communication. CONCLUSION: Communication needs to be improved in future redeployments. Future research should consider a larger cohort and more input from team members who remained on the pre-COVID-19 studies in order to improve the transition back from redeployment.","Walker, Kathryn Louise; Gerakios, Florence",Br J Nurs,,259

345285,"The Risks of Prescribing Hydroxychloroquine for Treatment of COVID-19-First, Do No Harm",2020,"INTRODUCTION: Female orgasmic disorder (FOD) is defined as the absence, delay, infrequency, or marked diminishment in intensity of orgasm in at least 75% of sexual experiences, persisting for at least 6 months and causing distress, has specified subtypes, and affects up to 28% of women in the United States and up to 46% in countries across Asia. Orgasmic difficulties are relatively common and create distress for a substantial number of women, though efficacious treatments exist. OBJECTIVE: This article provides a review of psychological treatment of FOD. METHODS: A literature search was conducted using PsycINFO to identify research reporting methods and outcomes of psychological treatment of FOD in peer-reviewed journals and textbooks. Search terms were female orgasmic disorder, anorgasmia, female sexual dysfunction, and orgasm. This search was supplemented with hand-searching references of review articles and journal articles. RESULTS: Psychological treatment has been shown to be effective in helping women with FOD to gain or regain the ability to have orgasms, with higher success rates overall of treating lifelong or generalized vs acquired or situational FOD. Of the variety of treatment approaches that have been tested, the most consistent support emerges for directed masturbation, sensate focus, and psychotherapy. Approaches with little evidence for efficacy as a primary mode of treatment include systematic desensitization, bibliotherapy, and coital alignment technique training. CONCLUSION: While existing research provides a solid foundation of knowledge, treatment of FOD has seen little innovation since the 1980s. Future research should aim for broader understanding of etiologies of all types of FOD, understanding reasons for lack of treatment success for women who have not improved with treatment, and identifying ways of tailoring FOD treatment and success rates for multicultural and community populations.

In up to 20% of cases, COVID-19 infection can take a severe, life-threatening course. Therefore, preventive measures such as mask-wearing, hand hygiene, and social distancing are important. COVID-19 vaccines that use novel vaccine technology can prevent up to 95% of infections. However, the uncertainty regarding the efficacy and safety of vaccination in patients with autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic disease (AIIRD), who are immunocompromised due to underlying immune dysfunction and concomitant immunosuppressive treatment, warrants clear guidance. A task force of the Korean College of Rheumatology formulated a set of vaccination guidance based on the currently available data and expert consensus. The currently available COVID-19 vaccines are considered to be safe and effective. Every patient with AIIRD should receive one of the available COVID-19 vaccines unless contraindicated for medical reasons such as prior allergy/anaphylaxis to the COVID-19 vaccine or its components. Patients should continue immunosuppressive treatment for their underlying AIIRD, including biological and targeted synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (b/tsDMARDs). Corticosteroids should be reduced to the lowest dose possible without aggravating the AIIRD. To improve the vaccine response, methotrexate can be withheld for 1-2 weeks after each vaccination, and the timing of rituximab and abatacept infusion should be adjusted if clinically acceptable. Rheumatologists should play a leading role in educating and vaccinating patients with AIIRD.","Park, Jin Kyun; Lee, Eun Bong; Shin, Kichul; Sung, Yoon Kyoung; Kim, Tae Hwan; Kwon, Seong Ryul; Lee, Myeung Su; Hong, Seung Jae; Choi, Byoong Yong; Lee, Shin Seok; Back, Han Joo",J Korean Med Sci,,259
346942,COVID-19 in children with chronic kidney disease: findings from the UK renal registry,2020,"Regional resilience refers to an immanent condition for facing multiple risks on a permanent basis, both episodic and incremental. These risks are not only linked to natural disasters and climate change, but also to poverty and inequality of access to services such as health, and personal safety. This article considers the underlying conditions that shape regional resilience in Chile, based on inter-regional and intra-regional comparisons in the Metropolitan Region of Santiago and the Region of Araucanía. Instead of viewing resilience in terms of an ability to counter a single risk, the article highlights the fact that risks are multiple and overlapping over time and generated at different scales. Municipal level data on poverty, health, and public finances in the two regions reveal the contrasting underlying inequalities that point to regional mosaics of resilience rather than homogeneity. Different threats are superposed on these preexisting conditions of resilience. The article refers to three in particular: the 2010 Chilean earthquake (episodic);climate change (episodic and incremental);and the Covid-19 pandemic (episodic). The findings point to high levels of urban versus rural differentiation, and also high differentiation within the Santiago Metropolitan Area based on socio-economic conditions. This regional mosaic of underlying structural conditions suggests that regional resilience can be enhanced by engaging with structural socio-spatial inequalities rather than a focus on managing risks via siloed, threat-by-threat responses. © 2021 by the authors.

At the end of January 2020, 2519 laboratory confirmed cases with a case-fatality rate of 34.3% have been reported. Approximately 84% of human cases have been reported in the tropical region of Saudi Arabia. The emergence of MERS-CoV has highlighted need for a rapid and accurate assay to triage patients with a suspected infection in a timely manner because of the lack of an approved vaccine or an effective treatment for MERS-CoV to prevent and control potential outbreaks. In this study, we present two rapid and visual nucleic acid assays that target the MERS-CoV UpE and N genes as a panel that combines reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification with a closed vertical flow visualization strip (RT-RPA-VF). This test panel was designed to improve the diagnostic accuracy through dual-target screening after referencing laboratory testing guidance for MERS-CoV. The limit of detection was 1.2×101 copies/µl viral RNA for the UpE assay and 1.2 copies/µl viral RNA for the N assay, with almost consistent with the sensitivity of the RT-qPCR assays. The two assays exhibited no cross-reactivity with multiple CoVs, including the bat severe acute respiratory syndrome related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV), the bat coronavirus HKU4, and the human coronaviruses 229E, OC43, HKU1 and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Furthermore, the panel does not require sophisticated equipment and provides rapid detection within 30 min. This panel displays good sensitivity and specificity and may be useful to rapidly detect MERS-CoV early during an outbreak and for disease surveillance.","Huang, Pei; Jin, Hongli; Zhao, Yongkun; Li, Entao; Yan, Feihu; Chi, Hang; Wang, Qi; Han, Qiuxue; Mo, Ruo; Song, Yumeng; Bi, Jinhao; Jiao, Cuicui; Li, Wujian; He, Hongbin; Wang, Hongmei; Ma, Aimin; Feng, Na; Wang, Jianzhong; Wang, Tiecheng; Yang, Songtao; Gao, Yuwei; Xia, Xianzhu; Wang, Hualei",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,,259
349194,"Anti-coagulation in COVID-19: Dare I Give, Dare I Don't!",2021,"The COVID pandemic has made telematic consultations a basic tool in daily practice. AIMS: The main objective of the study is to assess the results of the application of telematic consultations to limit the mobility of patients. The operational objectives are; to propose a consultation plan, to know how attendance limits consultations and to define which pathologies benefit the most from this plan. METHODS: A scheme is proposed with the creation of pre-scheduled clinic to assess suitability and the possibility of carrying them out in a single non face-to-face act. RESULTS: Phone call to 5,619 patients were made with a lack of response of 19%. The cases of 74% of the patients that answered were resolved virtually. There is a difference between units, obtaining a higher answering rate from patients appointed to specific clinic units, OR = 0.60, or to general trauma ones, OR = 0.67. The lowest answering rate was obtained from those derived from the emergency department. Twenty per cent of the consultations were not accompanied by complementary tests that would have favored the resolution in a single act. The general trauma consultations, OR = 0.34, postoperative control, OR = 0.49, and specific unit ones, OR = 0.40, were the ones that better met this requirement. Out of the remaining patients, the general trauma consultations, OR = 0.50, and those referred to units, OR = 0.54, were the ones that had a higher resolution rate without in- person consultation. CONCLUSIONS: The cases of 74% of the patients who answered the phone call were resolved virtually. Cases of 20% of the patients cannot be solved in a single act because they are derived without complementary tests. Osteosynthesis and postoperative arthroscopic follow-up consultations are the ones that need to be carried out in person the most.","Zamora Navas, P; Montañez Heredia, E; Nieto Orellana, J; Gónzalez García, C; Cano Obando, L; Cárdenas Rebollo, L; Abderrachid Al Chaid, Y; Saadouli Arco, M; Rodríguez Delourme, I; Díez Izquierdo, M; Prado Martín de Lucía, L F; Durán Garrido, J; Fernández Hijano, M; Víquez da Silva, R; Olofsson Suárez-Bárcena, C; Jiménez Garrido, C; García Vera, J J; Pérez Cardeña, J; Irízar Jiménez, S; Esteban Del Castillo, J L; García Píriz, M; Gómez Palomo, J M; Fernández Martín, F J A; Huertas Segador, P; Santos de la Fuente, J; Serrano Fernández, J; Estades Rubio, F; Fernández de Rota, A; García Herrera, J M; Leiva Gea, A; Lombardo Torre, M; Mariscal Lara, J; Martín Castilla, B; Urbano Labajos, V; Sánchez García, A; Quirante Sánchez, V; Cañada Oya, S; Rodríguez Jiménez, M; Delgado Rufino, B; Queipo de Llano Temboury, A; Barón Romero, M; López Hermoso, M D; Benavente Casajús, M; Loring Caffarena, T; Chaparro Villar, M A; de la Torre Solís, F",Rev. esp. cir. ortop. traumatol.

350295,"Type-2 diabetes, a co-morbidity in Covid-19: does insulin signaling matter?",2021,"In a very short time, the health commissioner had mobilized an army of volunteers, coordinated the efforts of community organizations, plastered the city with educational literature, isolated the sick, and assuaged the doubts of businesspeople and politicians who feared personal loss from the emergency regulations.1 Milwaukee's actions to quell influenza were similar to or exactly the same as methods tried by other cities.3 Along with liberty bond parades (which in Philadelphia demonstrably spread influenza),4,5 masks carried patriotic value and gave the public a way to exhibit and celebrate their loyalty. Growing in opposition to corrupt and patronage-laden politics, a coalition of ethnic, middle-class, and labor interests joined together under a pragmatic Socialist banner to institute trustworthy, responsive government to address urban problems.8 Comprehensive and efficient health policies to improve public services, such as infant welfare programs and community clinics, drawing on the advice of experts, aimed to build a healthier city. By 1918, when the Socialists retained the mayoralty but no longer controlled the common council, progressive policies and programs that developed private-public cooperation had achieved citywide trust in local government's attempts to ameliorate urban problems.9 Socialist mayor Daniel Hoan and wide-ranging community groups actively supported Ruhland in his work. [...]understanding the responses to the COVID-19 epidemic is incomplete without analysis of medical inequities based on race and class and the prominence of the Black Lives Matter movement.12,13 Unlike during the 1918 epidemic, African American health disparities and deaths are now a prominent and publicized feature.14 Because the health system does not serve all populations equally, many Americans feel they cannot trust medical advice about treatment and vaccinations.","Leavitt, Judith Walzer PhD",American Journal of Public Health,,259

352738,The shadow of social determinants: Geographic obstetric disparities predict regional COVID-19 burden,2021,"The recent outbreak of COVID-19 has been rapidly spreading on a global scale. To date, there is no specific vaccine against the causative virus, SARS-CoV-2, nor is there an effective medicine for treating COVID-19, thus raising concerns with respect to the effect of risk factors such as clinical course and pathophysiological parameters on disease severity and outcome in patients with COVID-19. By extracting and analyzing all available published clinical data, we identified several major clinical characteristics associated with increased disease severity and mortality among patients with COVID-19. Specifically, preexisting chronic conditions such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes are strongly associated with an increased risk of developing severe COVID-19; surprisingly, however, we found no correlation between chronic liver disease and increased disease severity. In addition, we found that both acute cardiac injury and acute kidney injury are highly correlated with an increased risk of COVID-19-related mortality. Given the high risk of comorbidity and the high mortality rate associated with tissue damage, organ function should be monitored closely in patients diagnosed with COVID-19, and this approach should be included when establishing new guidelines for managing these high-risk patients. Moreover, additional clinical data are needed in order to determine whether a supportive therapy can help mitigate the development of severe, potentially fatal complications, and further studies are needed to identify the pathophysiology and the mechanism underlying this novel coronavirus-associated infectious disease. Taken together, these findings provide new insights regarding clinical strategies for improving the management and outcome of patients with COVID-19.","Wang, Xinhui; Fang, Xuexian; Cai, Zhaoxian; Wu, Xiaotian; Gao, Xiaotong; Min, Junxia; Wang, Fudi",Res.,,259

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of this intervention on clinical outcome. METHODS: In this mono-centric, controlled, before-after study, all consecutive adult patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to ICU from March 13th to April 20th 2020 were included. A thromboprophylaxis protocol, including augmented LMWH dosing, individually tailored with anti-Xa measurements and twice-weekly ultrasonography screening for DVT, was implemented on March 31th 2020. Primary endpoint is one-month mortality. Secondary outcomes include two-week and three-week mortality, the incidence of VTE, acute kidney injury and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). Multiple regression modelling was used to correct for differences between the two groups. RESULTS: 46 patients were included in the before group, 26 patients in the after group. One month mortality decreased from 39.13% to 3.85% (p < 0.001). After correction for confounding variables, one-month mortality was significantly higher in the before group (p = 0.02, OR 8.86 (1.46, 53.75)). The cumulative incidence of VTE and CRRT was respectively 41% and 30.4% in the before group and dropped to 15% (p = 0.03) and 3.8% (p = 0.01), respectively. After correction for confounding variables, risk of VTE (p = 0.03, 6.01 (1.13, 32.12)) and CRRT (p = 0.02, OR 19.21 (1.44, 255.86)) remained significantly higher in the before group. CONCLUSION: Mortality, cumulative risk of VTE and need for CRRT may be significantly reduced in COVID-19 patients by implementation of a more aggressive thromboprophylaxis protocol. Future research should focus on confirmation of these results in a randomized design and on uncovering the mechanisms underlying these observations.

METHODS: A cross-sectional pilot study, with 742 observations of online surveys in 422, 190, and 130 individuals from Mexico, Chile, and Spain, respectively. Sociodemographic data, presence of comorbidities, food habits, and physical activity (PA) patterns were evaluated. The HRQoL was evaluated according to the SF-36 Health Survey. The multilinear regression analysis was developed to determine the association of variables with HRQoL and its physical and mental health dimensions. RESULTS: The female sex in the three countries reported negative association with HRQoL (Mexico: ß -4.45, p = 0.004; Chile: ß -8.48, p < 0.001; Spain: ß -6.22, p = 0.009). Similarly, bad eating habits were associated negatively with HRQoL (Mexico: ß -6.64, p < 0.001; Chile: ß -6.66, p = 0.005; Spain: ß -5.8, p = 0.032). In Mexico, PA limitations presented a negative association with HRQoL (ß -4.71, p = 0.011). In Chile, a sedentary lifestyle (h/day) was linked negatively with HRQoL (ß -0.64, p = 0.005). In Spain, the highest associations with HRQoL were the presence of comorbidity (ß -11.03, p < 0.001) and smoking (ß -6.72, p = 0.02). Moreover, the PA limitation in Mexico (ß -5.67, p = 0.023) and Chile (ß -9.26, p = 0.035) was linked negatively with mental health.

361422,Outcomes following PCI in CABG candidates during the COVID-19 pandemic: The prospective multicentre UK-ReVasc registry,2021,"At the end of December 2019, a new strain of coronavirus was identified in the Wuhan city of Hubei province in China. Within a shorter period of time, an unprecedented outbreak of this strain was witnessed over the entire Wuhan city. This novel coronavirus strain was later officially renamed as COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019) by the World Health Organization. The mode of transmission was human-to-human contact and hence resulted in a rapid surge across the globe where more than 24 million people have been infected with COVID-19. In the current scenario, finding potent drug candidates for the treatment of COVID-19 has emerged as the most challenging task for clinicians and researchers worldwide. Identification of new drugs and vaccine development may take from a few months to years based on the clinical trial processes. To overcome the several limitations involved in identifying and bringing out potent drug candidates for treating COVID-19, in the present study attempts were made to screen the FDA approved drugs using High Throughput Virtual Screening (HTVS). The COVID-19 main protease (COVID-19 Mpro) was chosen as the drug target for which the FDA approved drugs were initially screened with HTVS. The drug candidates that exhibited favorable docking score, energy, and emodel calculations were further taken for performing Induced Fit Docking (IFD) using Schrodinger's GLIDE. From the flexible docking results, the following four FDA approved drugs Sincalide, Pentagastrin, Ritonavir, and Phytonadione were identified. In particular, Sincalide and Pentagastrin can be considered potential key players for the treatment of COVID-19 disease.","Balakrishnan, Vijayakumar; Lakshminarayanan, Karthik",Int J Pept Res Ther,,259

A Population-Based Study in Korea,2020,"BackgroundQuantitative CT (QCT) analysis is an invaluable diagnostic tool to assess lung injury and predict prognosis of patients affected by COVID-19 pneumonia. PTX3 was recently described as one of the most reliable serological predictors of clinical deterioration and short-term mortality. The present study was designed to evaluate a correlation between serological biomarkers of inflammation and lung injury measured by QCT. MethodsThis retrospective monocentric study analysed a cohort of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and admitted because of respiratory failure, or significant radiological involvement on chest CT scan. All patients, males and non-pregnant females older than 18 years, underwent chest CT scan and laboratory testing at admission. Exclusion criteria were defined by concurrent acute pathological processes and ongoing specific treatments which could interfere with immune activity. The cohort was stratified based on severity in mild and severe forms. Compromised lung at QCT was then correlated to serological biomarkers representative of SARS-CoV-2. We further developed a multivariable logistic model to predict CT data and clinical deterioration based on a specific molecular signature. Internal cross-validation led to evaluate discrimination, calibration, and clinical utility of the tool that was provided by a score to simplify its application. Findings592 patients were recruited between March 19th and December 1st, 2020. Applying exclusion criteria which consider confounders, the cohort resulted in 366 individuals characterized by 177 mild and 189 severe forms. In our predictive model, blood levels of PTX3, CRP and LDH were found to correlate with QCT values in mild COVID-19 disease. A signature of these three biomarkers had a high predictive accuracy in detecting compromised lungs as assessed by QCT. The score was elaborated and resulted representative of lung CT damage leading to clinical deterioration and oxygen need in mild disease. InterpretationThe LDH, PTX3, CRP blood signature can serve as a strong correlate of compromised lung in COVID-19, possibly integrating cellular damage, systemic inflammation, myeloid and endothelial cell activation. FundingThis work was supported by a philanthropic donation by Dolce & Gabbana fashion house (to A.M., C.G.) and by a grant from Italian Ministry of Health for COVID-19 (to A.M. and C.G.). Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSBesides nasopharyngeal swab and serological test, chest CT scan represents one of the most useful tools to confirm COVID-19 diagnosis; moreover, QCT has been demonstrated to foresee oxygen need as well as deterioration of health status. Several clinical and serological parameters have been studied alone or combined in scores to be applied as prognostic tools of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia; however, no one has yet reached the everyday practice. Recently, our group has investigated the expression and clinical significance of PTX3 in COVID-19 demonstrating the correlation with short-term mortality independently of confounders. The result was confirmed by other studies in different settings increasing evidence of PTX3 as a strong biomarker of severity; noteworthy, a recent report analysed proteomic data with a machine learning approach identifying age with PTX3 or SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia as the best binary signatures associated to 28-days mortality. Added value of this studyThe present study was designed to investigate associations between markers of damage and the CT extension of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in order to provide a biological footprint of radiological results in paucisymptomatic patients. QCT data were considered in a binary form identifying a threshold relevant for clinical deterioration, as already proved by literature. Our findings demonstrate a significant correlation with three peripheral blood proteins (PTX3, LDH and CRP) which result representative of COVID-19 severity. The study presents a predictive model of radiological lung involvement which performs with a high level of accuracy (cvAUC of 0{middle dot}794{+/-}0{middle dot}107; CI 95%: 0{middle dot}74-0{middle dot}87) and a simple score was provided to simplify the interpretation of the three biomarkers. Besides additional finding on PTX3 role in SARS-CoV2 pathology, its prognostic value was confirmed by data on clinical deterioration; indeed, paucisymptomatic subjects showed a 11{middle dot}9% deaths. The model offers the possibility to quickly assess patients resulted positive for SARS-CoV-2 and estimate people at risk of deterioration despite normal clinical and blood gases analysis, with potential to identify those who need better clinical monitoring and interventions. Implications of all the available evidencePredicting the extension, severity, and clinical deterioration in COVID-19 patients its pivotal to allocate enough resources in emergency and to avoid health system burden. Despite the urgent clinical need of biomarkers, SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia still lacks something able to provide an easy measure of its severity. Some multiparametric scores have been proposed for severe COVID-19 and rely on deep assessment of patients status (clinical, serological, and radiological data). Our model represents an unprecedented effort to provide a tool which could predict CT pneumonia extension, oxygen requirement and clinical deterioration in mild COVID-19. Based on the measurement of three proteins on peripheral blood, this score could improve early assessment of asymptomatic patients tested positive by SARS-CoV2 specifically in first level hospitals as well in developing countries.","Folci, Marco; Brunetta, Enrico; Lanza, Ezio; Bottazzi, Barbara; Protti, Alessandro; Messana, Gaia; Lisi, Costanza; Leone, Roberto; Sironi, Marina; Generali, Elena; Rodolfi, Stefano; Sagasta, Michele; Voza, Antonio; Ciccarelli, Michele; Garlanda, Cecilia; Balzarini, Luca; Mantovani, Alberto; Cecconi, Maurizio; Force, - Humanitas COVID-19 Task",,,259

The clinical specificity was assessed on 215 pre-pandemic sera (including some from patients with viral infections or autoimmune disorders). The clinical sensitivity was evaluated on 710 sera from 564 patients whose SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed by qRT-PCR and whose antibody response was compared to that measured by five other commercial tests. The kinetics of the antibody response were also analyzed in seven symptomatic patients. The specificity of the test (BioS) on pre-pandemic specimens was 98.1% (95% CI: 96.2-99.4). When tested on the 710 pandemic specimens, BioS showed an overall clinical sensitivity of 86.0% (95% CI: 0.83-0.89), with good concordance with the Euroimmun assay (overall concordance of 0.91; Cohen's kappa coefficient of 0.62). Due in part to simultaneous detection of IgM and IgG for both S1 and N proteins, BioS exhibited the highest positive percent agreement &#8805;11 days post symptom onset (PSO). In conclusion, the BioS IgM/IgG rapid test was highly specific and demonstrated higher positive percent agreement compared to all the ELISA/CLIA commercial tests considered in this study. Moreover, by detecting the presence of antibodies prior to 11 days PSO in 78.2% of the patients, the BioS test increased the efficiency of the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the early stages of the disease.","Plebani, Mario; Parcina, Marijo; Bechri, Issam; Zehender, Gianguglielmo; Terkes, Vedrana; Abdel Hafith, Balqis; Antinori, Spinello; Pillet, Sylvie; Gonzalo, Sylvie; Hoerauf, Achim; Lai, Alessia; Morovic, Miro; Bourlet, Thomas; Torre, Alessandro; Pozzetto, Bruno; Galli, Massimo",J. clin. microbiol,,259
367214,The day after COVID-19,2020,"BackgroundCOVID-19 vaccine is the mighty weapon opted by all the countries across the globe in an attempt to eradicate the fatal COVID-19 pandemic. The myths on the COVID-19 vaccine are spreading widely, causing a hindrance to this noble preventive measure. The prevalence of such myths among the healthcare professionals may be toxic and deadly. Aim & ObjectivesTo assess the knowledge, attitude, and practice of the healthcare professionals regarding the myths on COVID-19 vaccination and to demystify them. Materials and MethodsAn 18-item questionnaire evaluating knowledge, attitude, and practice based on the existing myths on COVID-19 vaccination was circulated through Google Forms(R) among the 412 healthcare professionals of six disciplines belonging to a private University. The responses obtained were subjected to statistical analysis using SPSS(R) 20 software package. ResultsA total of 385 health professionals participated in this study. The majority of them had medium knowledge (165) and positive attitude (273) with the mean knowledge and attitude scores of 3.82 {+/-} 1.55 out of 6 and 4.3 {+/-} 1.58 out of 7 respectively. Even though 312 participants got vaccinated, 72 of them failed to receive it. The knowledge scores showed a high statistically significant difference among the participants of different designations (p=0.001), but not with gender, field, and staff with different years of experience (p>0.05). The attitude scores were statistically different among participants of fields and designation (p<0.05) but not among genders (p=0.31) and staff with different years of experience (p=0.87). Knowledge and attitude scores showed a positive linear correlation and a high statistically significant difference (p<0.001). ConclusionThis study recommends more enhanced education programs on COVID-19 vaccination for the health professionals and demands an improved knowledge, attitude, and practice among them to achieve the goal of 100% vaccination so as to completely eradicate the COVID-19 pandemic.","LOKESHKUMAR, S; NAIK, ZAMEERA; PANWAR, ARUN; SRIDHAR, M; KELUSKAR, VAISHALI; RAMSURATHKUMAR, K",,,259

Design: This was a retrospective cohort study designed to compare doses of sedatives between ICU patients receiving standard IV sedation and patients receiving mixed sedation including inhaled isoflurane. Data were obtained from electronic medical records. Setting: ICU at large academic medical center where mechanical ventilation was delivered with Draeger Apollo (Draeger Medical, Telford, PA) anesthesia machines. Patients: Consecutive adult patients (&#8805; 18 yr) with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 admitted to ICU between April 2, 2020, and May 4, 2020. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: Thirty-five mechanically ventilated patients were included in the study, with a mean (sd) age of 59.4 (12.8) years. Twenty-three patients (65.7%) were men. Seventeen patients (48.6%) received standard IV sedation, whereas 18 (51.4%) also received isoflurane. The mean duration of mechanical ventilation (sd) was 23.3 (11.6) days in the standard sedation group and 23.8 (12.5) days in the isoflurane group. Mean (sd) duration of isoflurane exposure was 5.61 (2.99) days, representing 29.1% of total sedation time (sd, 20.4). Cumulative opioid exposure did not differ between the standard sedation and isoflurane sedation groups (mean morphine milligram equivalent 6668 [sd, 1,346] vs 6678 [sd, 2,000] mg). However, the initiation of isoflurane in patients was associated with decreased utilization of propofol (mean daily amount 3,656 [sd, 1,635] before vs 950 [sd, 1,804] mg during isoflurane) and hydromorphone (mean daily amount 48 [sd, 30] before vs 23 [sd, 27] mg). Conclusions: In the subjects that received isoflurane, its use was associated with significant decreases in propofol and hydromorphone infusions.","Hanidziar, Dusan; Baldyga, Kathryn; Ji, Christine S; Lu, Jing; Zheng, Hui; Wiener-Kronish, Jeanine; Xie, Zhongcong",Crit Care Explor,,259
372552,Are we on brink of a second COVID-19 wave in Italy? Let's look at Google Trends,2020,"OBJECTIVES: No agent has yet been proven to be effective for the treatment of patients with severe COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a pilot prospective open, single-arm multicentre study on off-label use of tocilizumab (TCZ) involving 63 hospitalised adult patients (56 males, age 62.6±12.5) with severe COVID-19. Clinical and laboratory parameters were prospectively collected at baseline, day 1, 2, 7 and 14. No moderate-to-severe adverse events attributable to TCZ were recorded. RESULTS: We observed a significant improvement in the levels of ferritin, C-reactive protein, D-dimer. The ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen (Pa02) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (Fi02) improved (mean±SD Pa02/Fi02 at admission: 152±53; at day 7: 283.73±115.9, at day 14: 302.2±126, p<0.05). The overall mortality was 11%; D-dimer level at baseline, but not IL-6 levels were predictors of mortality. TCZ administration within 6 days from admission in the hospital was associated with an increased likelihood of survival (HR 2.2 95%CI 1.3-6.7, p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In hospitalised adult patients with severe COVID-19, TCZ could be a safe option. An improvement in respiratory and laboratory parameters was observed. Future controlled trials in patients with severe illness are urgently needed to confirm the definite benefit with IL-6 target therapy.","Sciascia, Savino; Aprà, Franco; Baffa, Alessandra; Baldovino, Simone; Boaro, Daniela; Boero, Roberto; Bonora, Stefano; Calcagno, Andrea; Cecchi, Irene; Cinnirella, Giacoma; Converso, Marcella; Cozzi, Martina; Crosasso, Paola; De Iaco, Fabio; Di Perri, Giovanni; Eandi, Mario; Fenoglio, Roberta; Giusti, Massimo; Imperiale, Daniele; Imperiale, Gianlorenzo; Livigni, Sergio; Manno, Emilpaolo; Massara, Carlo; Milone, Valeria; Natale, Giuseppe; Navarra, Mauro; Oddone, Valentina; Osella, Sara; Piccioni, Pavilio; Radin, Massimo; Roccatello, Dario; Rossi, Daniela",Clin Exp Rheumatol,,259

Despite that, existing clot retraction assays hold limitations such as large footprint and low throughput. In this work, we report the design of flexural post rings for a miniaturized assay of clot retraction force (CRF) with high throughput. Leveraging surface tensions, the post rings hold blood samples in a highly reproducible fashion while simultaneously serving as cantilever beams to measure the CRF. We investigated the effect on the device performance of major parameters, namely, surface hydrophobicity, post number, and post stiffness. We then tested the devices using 14 patient samples and revealed the correlation between CRF and fibrinogen levels. We further implemented an automated liquid handler and developed a high-throughput platform for clot retraction assay. The device's small sample consumption, simple operation, and good compatibility with existing automation facilities make it a promising high-throughput clot retraction assay.","Huang, Lanzhu; Liu, Xinyu; Ou, Yuanbin; Huang, Haofan; Zhang, Xia; Wang, Yize; Liang, Yong; Yu, Xiaxia; Zheng, Weidong; Zhang, Huisheng; Li, Zida",ACS Sens,,259

We investigated the impact of these restrictions on HIV preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) use among Australian gay and bisexual men (GBM). METHODS: Participants in an ongoing online cohort study previously reported PrEP use from 2014 to 2019. In April 2020, 847 HIV-negative and untested participants completed questionnaires assessing changes in PrEP use as a result of COVID-19 public health measures. Binary logistic multiple regression was used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) to compare changes in PrEP use behaviors. RESULTS: Among 847 men, mean age was 44.1 years (SD: 12.7). PrEP use rose from 4.9% in 2015 to 47.2% in 2020. Among those, 41.8% (n = 167) discontinued PrEP use during COVID-19 restrictions. Discontinuing PrEP during COVID-19 restrictions was independently associated with being less likely to have recently tested for HIV (aOR: 0.17; 95% CI: 0.09 to 0.34; P < 0.001) and less likely to report sex with casual partners (aOR: 0.28; 95% CI: 0.14 to 0.54; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: By April 2020, following the introduction of COVID-19 restrictions, GBM dramatically reduced PrEP use, coinciding with a reduction in sexual activity. Longer-term impacts of COVID-19 restrictions on sexual behaviors among GBM need to be monitored because they may foreshadow fluctuations in prevention coverage and risk of HIV infection. Our findings indicate a potential need for clear, targeted information about resumption of PrEP and on-demand optimal dosing regimens in response to ongoing changes in restrictions.","Hammoud, Mohamed A; Grulich, Andrew; Holt, Martin; Maher, Lisa; Murphy, Dean; Jin, Fengyi; Bavinton, Benjamin; Haire, Bridget; Ellard, Jeanne; Vaccher, Stefanie; Saxton, Peter; Bourne, Adam; Degenhardt, Louisa; Storer, Daniel; Prestage, Garrett",J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr,,259

Recent emerging literature and expert opinions in popular media have indicated various factors that may explain cross-country difference in fatality rates. These factors range from access to public health infrastructure, BCG vaccination policies, demographic structure, restrictive policy interventions and the weather. In addition, articles are examining different kinds of fatality rates that can be explained. Progressing beyond fragmented databases and anecdotal evidence, we have developed a database for such factors, have explored various econometric models to test the explanatory power of these factors in explaining several kinds of fatality rates. Based on available data, our study reveals that factors such as public health system, population age structure, poverty level and BCG vaccination are powerful contributory factors in determining fatality rates. Interactions between factors such as poverty level and BCG vaccination provide interesting insights into the complex interplay of factors. Our analysis suggests that poor citizens’ access to the public healthcare system are worse in many countries irrespective of whether they are developed or developing countries.","Banik, Arindam; Nag, Tirthankar; Chowdhury, Sahana Roy; Chatterjee, Rajashri",Global Bus.

This study uses a cross-sectional design, with purposive snowball sampling, for primary survey data collected over 10 weeks starting the first week in April 2020. A total of 374 adults participated in the study. Logistic binary regression was used to identify key predictors among sociodemographic characteristics, stress related to COVID-19, and perceived stress of group membership for those who reported IPV experiences. A t test was used to statistically differentiate between IPV-reporters and non-IPV reporters based on perceived stress measured by the Perceived Stress Scale. Results indicated that respondents who reported renting, lost income due to COVID-19, and increased nutritional stress were all more likely to belong to the IPV-reporters group. These findings provide insight into additional stressors related to the ongoing pandemic, such as stress due to income loss, nutritional stress, and renting, and their likelihood of increasing IPV victimization.

379333,Extensive Aortic Thrombosis in a Patient With COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: The prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms in patients with COVID-19 is higher than usual. Previous studies have shown that there are drug-to-drug interactions between antiretroviral drugs and antidepressants. Therefore, an effective and safe treatment method was needed. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is the first-line psychological therapy in clinical treatment. Computerized CBT (cCBT) was proven to be an effective alternative to CBT and does not require face-to-face therapy between a therapist and the patient, which suited the COVID-19 pandemic response. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of the cCBT program we developed in improving depressive and anxiety symptoms among patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We customized a cCBT program focused on improving depressive and anxiety symptoms among patients with COVID-19, and then, we assessed its effectiveness. Screening was based on symptoms of depression or anxiety for patients who scored &#8805;7 on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD17) or the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA). A total of 252 patients with COVID-19 at five sites were randomized into two groups: cCBT + treatment as usual (TAU; n=126) and TAU without cCBT (n=126). The cCBT + TAU group received the cCBT intervention program for 1 week. The primary efficacy measures were the HAMD17 and HAMA scores. The secondary outcome measures were the Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS), Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), and Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS). Assessments were carried out pre- and postintervention. The patients' symptoms of anxiety and depression in one of the centers were assessed again within 1 month after the postintervention assessment. RESULTS: The cCBT + TAU group displayed a significantly decreased score on the HAMD17, HAMA, SDS, SAS, and AIS after the intervention compared to the TAU group (all P<.001). A mixed-effects repeated measures model revealed significant improvement in symptoms of depression (HAMD17 and SDS scores, both P<.001), anxiety (HAMA and SAS scores, both P<.001), and insomnia (AIS score, P=.002) during the postintervention and follow-up periods in the cCBT + TAU group. Additionally, the improvement of insomnia among females (P=.14) and those with middle school education (P=.48) in the cCBT + TAU group showed no significant differences when compared to the TAU group. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study suggest that the cCBT program we developed was an effective nonpharmacological treatment for symptoms of anxiety, depression, and insomnia among patients with COVID-19. Further research is warranted to investigate the long-term effects of cCBT for symptoms of anxiety, depression, and insomnia in patients with COVID-19.

Texting, especially via Twitter, is very popular among people of all ages all over the world, and enormous text data is generated regularly which contains various types of information, rumors, sentimental expressions etc. The variety of topics related to the contents of the social media data are prone to changes with the passing of time and sometimes fade out completely after a certain time. Such time varying topics may include beneficial information that could be used for various decision making by general public as well as governmental organization. Especially for the recent pandemic of COVID-19, extraction and visualization of the changing needs of people might help them making some better countermeasures. In this study, COVID-19 related tweets have been collected and analyzed in units of time (hour, day and month) by means of various clustering models to visualize the dynamic changes of topics with time.

COVID-19 is defined as an ""external shock"" followed by a deep recession. Leaving aside the natural process of viral mutation, the pandemic, recession and pincer-grip crisis can be understood as distinct repulsions of an hyperglobalization that is gradually undermining its own conditions of existence. Meanwhile, the recent rupture cannot be adequately grasped without taking into account the financial crash of 2007 to 2009, the political interregnum of the post-crisis years and the tendency towards bonapartistic democracy. By itself, the corona crisis will not lead to a ""build back better""; the emergency state is hardly capable of such a setting of the course. Instead, there is a rising danger that fierce conflicts over distribution, increasing inequality and desolidarization will make a turn to sustainability even harder.","Dörre, Klaus",Berl J Soziol,,259

Despite this, there is no evidence that horizontal equity, with respect to income, was violated for NHS hospital outpatient and inpatient care during the first wave of the pandemic. There is evidence of pro-rich inequities in use of GP consultations, prescriptions and medical helplines at the peak of the first wave, but these were eliminated as the pandemic progressed.

393624,Author Response: A Prospective Study of Neurologic Disorders in Hospitalized Patients With COVID-19 in New York City,2021,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: During the COVID-19 pandemic in Israel, people residing in continuing care retirement communities (CCRC) found themselves under strict instructions to self-isolate, imposed by the CCRC managements before, during, and after the nationwide lockdown. The present study explored the personal experiences of CCRC residents during the lockdown. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In-depth interviews were conducted with 24 CCRC residents from 13 different CCRCs. Authors performed a thematic analysis of interview transcripts, using constant comparisons and contrasts. RESULTS: Three major themes were identified: a). US VS. THEM: OTHERS ARE WORSE OFF: Older residents engaged in constant attempts to compare their situation to that of others. The overall message behind these downward comparisons was that the situation is not so bad, as others are in a worse predicament; b). US VS. THEM: POWER IMBALANCE: This comparison emphasized the unbalanced power-relations between older adults and the staff and management in the setting; and c). ""WE HAVE BECOME PRISONERS OF OUR OWN AGE."": Interviewees described strong emotions of despair, depression and anger, which were intensified when the rest of society returned back to a new routine, while they were still under lockdown. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: The measures imposed on residents by managements of CCRCs during the lockdown, and the emotional responses of distress among some of the residents, revealed that CCRCs have components of total institutions, not normally evident. This underscores the hidden emotional costs of the lockdown among those whose autonomy was compromised.","Ayalon, Liat; Avidor, Sharon",Age ageing,,259
393736,The Effect of prolonged PCR Positivity on patient Outcomes and Determination of Isolation period in COVID-19 patients,2021,"Identification of the causal risk factors of COVID-19 would allow better risk stratification and designing effective therapies. Epidemiological data have shown a higher incidence and mortality of COVID-19 in males compared to females. Here, we have used logistic regression analysis modeling to determine the association between gender and COVID-19 mortality in the Iranian population. The records of 2293 patients with COVID-19 infection were analyzed. The odds of death due to COVID-19 were 1.7 times higher in males compared to females after adjustment for age and background diseases. The gender difference was mainly observed at higher ages, suggesting an adjusted 2.32-fold higher risk of mortality in males aged >59.5 years old compared to females within the same age group. This finding suggests the male gender is a potential predisposing factor for mortality due to COVID-19 infection. The potential role of male hormones, particularly testosterone, as therapeutic targets deserves further investigation.","Vahedian-Azimi, Amir; Pourhoseingholi, Mohamad Amin; Saberi, Mohsen; Behnam, Behzad; Sahebkar, Amirhossein",Adv Exp Med Biol,,259

394479,COVID-19: Considerations of Diabetes and Cardiovascular Disease Management,2020,"COVID-19 pneumonia typically begins with subpleural ground glass opacities with progressive extension on computerized tomography studies. Lung ultrasound is well suited to this interstitial, subpleural involvement, and it is now broadly used in intensive care units (ICUs). The extension and severity of lung infiltrates can be described numerically with a reproducible and validated lung ultrasound score (LUSS). We hypothesized that LUSS might be useful as a tool to non-invasively monitor the evolution of COVID-19 pneumonia at the bedside. LUSS monitoring was rapidly implemented in the management of our COVID-19 patients with RT-PCR-documented COVID-19. The LUSS was evaluated repeatedly at the bedside. We present a graphic description of the course of LUSS during COVID-19 in 10 consecutive patients admitted in our intensive care unit with moderate to severe ARDS between March 15 and 30th. LUSS appeared to be closely related to the disease progression. In successfully extubated patients, LUSS decreased and was lower than at the time of intubation. LUSS increased inexorably in a patient who died from refractory hypoxemia. LUSS helped with the diagnosis of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), showing an increased score and the presence of new lung consolidations in all 5 patients with VAPs. There was also a good agreement between CT-scans and LUSS as for the presence of lung consolidations. In conclusion, our early experience suggests that LUSS monitoring accurately reflect disease progression and indicates potential usefulness for the management of COVID-19 patients with ARDS. It might help with early VAP diagnosis, mechanical ventilation weaning management, and potentially reduce the need for X-ray and CT exams. LUSS evaluation is easy to use and readily available in ICUs throughout the world, and might be a safe, cheap and simple tool to optimize critically ill COVID-19 patients care during the pandemic.","Dargent, Auguste; Chatelain, Emeric; Kreitmann, Louis; Quenot, Jean-Pierre; Cour, Martin; Argaud, Laurent",PLoS One,,259

There is the need to provide an update for each single medical discipline, including neurosurgery, to be used by single professionals or to be distributed through the neurosurgical community and to be used by governments in designing new scenario of care. METHODS: A review of the MEDLINE database was performed on April 13, 2020. Search terms included ""COVID-19,"" ""neurosurgery,"" and ""surgery."" A review of documents published on the webpage of the WFNS (World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies) and of the 5 continental associations of neurosurgical societies, AANS (American Association of Neurological Surgeons), AASNS (Asian Australasian Society of Neurological Surgeons), CAANS (Continental Association of African Neurosurgical Societies), EANS (European Association of Neurosurgical Societies), and FLANC (Latin American Federation of Neurosurgical Societies), representing the 119 national neurosurgical societies around the world, was performed. RESULTS: The literature search yielded 38 results that were manually reviewed. Fourteen manuscripts were considered eligible. They described suggestions and considerations to optimize care of neurosurgical patients, editorials on operational models, perspectives from neurosurgical departments, letters to the editor describing experiences on how to help medical staff to be prepared in advance for pandemic situations, and descriptions of regional or departmental models and/or organizational schemes. The webpages of the searched societies reported a total of 57 documents. CONCLUSIONS: The neurosurgical scientific community has promptly reacted to the COVID-19 outbreak by producing a growing number of documents that could serve as guidance for neurosurgeons all over the world. Neurosurgical societies will represent the key institutions for guiding the neurosurgical community to overcome the COVID-19 crisis.","Germanò, Antonino; Raffa, Giovanni; Angileri, Filippo Flavio; Cardali, Salvatore Massimiliano; Tomasello, Francesco",World neurosurgery (Online),,259

Healthcare professionals utilize masks all day long without replacing them very frequently, thus representing a source of cross-infection for patients and themselves. Nanotechnology is a powerful tool with the capability to produce nanomaterials with unique physicochemical and anti-pathogen properties. Here, we outline how to realize non-disposable and highly comfortable respirators with light-triggered self-disinfection ability by bridging bioactive nanofiber properties and stimuli-responsive nanomaterials. The visionary road highlighted in this Concept is based on the possibility to develop a new generation of masks based on multifunctional membranes where the presence of nanoclusters and plasmonic nanoparticles arranged in a hierarchical structure enables the realization of a chemically-driven and on-demand anti-pathogen activities. Multilayer electrospun membranes have the ability to dissipate humidity present within the mask, enhancing the wearability and usability. The photo-thermal disinfected membrane is the core of these 3D printed and reusable masks with moisture pump capability. Personalized face masks with smart nano-assisted destruction of pathogens will bring enormous advantages to the entire global community, especially for front-line personnel, and will open up great opportunities for innovative medical applications.","De Sio, Luciano; Ding, Bin; Focsan, Monica; Kogermann, Karin; Pascoal-Faria, Paula; Petronella, Francesca; Mitchell, Geoffrey; Zussman, Eyal; Pierini, Filippo",Chemistry,,259

403813,COVID-19 and kidney,2020,"Aptamers are nucleic acid analogues of antibodies with high affinity to different targets, such as cells, viruses, proteins, inorganic materials, and coenzymes. Empirical approaches allow the design of in vitro aptamers that bind particularly to a target molecule with high affinity and selectivity. Theoretical methods allow significant expansion of the possibilities of aptamer design. In this study, we review theoretical and joint theoretical-experimental studies dedicated to aptamer design and modeling. We consider aptamers with different targets, such as proteins, antibiotics, organophosphates, nucleobases, amino acids, and drugs. During nucleic acid modeling and in silico design, a full set of in silico methods can be applied, such as docking, molecular dynamics (MD), and statistical analysis. The typical modeling workflow starts with structure prediction. Then, docking of target and aptamer is performed. Next, MD simulations are performed, which allows for an evaluation of the stability of aptamer/ligand complexes and determination of the binding energies with higher accuracy. Then, aptamer/ligand interactions are analyzed, and mutations of studied aptamers made. Subsequently, the whole procedure of molecular modeling can be reiterated. Thus, the interactions between aptamers and their ligands are complex and difficult to understand using only experimental approaches. Docking and MD are irreplaceable when aptamers are studied in silico.","Buglak, Andrey A; Samokhvalov, Alexey V; Zherdev, Anatoly V; Dzantiev, Boris B",Int. j. mol. sci. (Online),,259
405084,Hospital care of patients with inherited cardiomyopathies in Germany during the Covid-19 pandemic insights from the German-wide Helios hospital network,2021,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has emerged in December 2019 when the first case was reported in Wuhan, China and turned into a pandemic with 27 million (September 9th) cases. Currently, there are over 95,000 complete genome sequences of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus causing COVID-19, in public databases, accompanying a growing number of studies. Nevertheless, there is still much to learn about the viral population variation when the virus is evolving as it continues to spread. We have analyzed SARS-CoV-2 genomes to identify the most variant sites, as well as the stable, conserved ones in samples collected in the Netherlands until June 2020. We identified the most frequent mutations in different geographies. We also performed a phylogenetic study focused on the Netherlands to detect novel variants emerging in the late stages of the pandemic and forming local clusters. We investigated the S and N proteins on SARS-CoV-2 genomes in the Netherlands and found the most variant and stable sites to guide development of diagnostics assays and vaccines. We observed that while the SARS-CoV-2 genome has accumulated mutations, diverging from reference sequence, the variation landscape is dominated by four mutations globally, suggesting the current reference does not represent the virus samples circulating currently. In addition, we detected novel variants of SARS-CoV-2 almost unique to the Netherlands that form localized clusters and region-specific sub-populations indicating community spread. We explored SARS-CoV-2 variants in the Netherlands until June 2020 within a global context; our results provide insight into the viral population diversity for localized efforts in tracking the transmission of COVID-19, as well as sequenced-based approaches in diagnostics and therapeutics. We emphasize that little diversity is observed globally in recent samples despite the increased number of mutations relative to the established reference sequence. We suggest sequence-based analyses should opt for a consensus representation to adequately cover the genomic variation observed to speed up diagnostics and vaccine design.","Urhan, Aysun; Abeel, Thomas",Sci Rep,,259
405777,Type 2 diabetes mellitus impaired nasal immunity and increased the risk of hyposmia in COVID-19 mild pneumonia patients,2021,"In their effort to prevent the spread of infections, retirement homes have been forced to limit physical interaction between residents and the outside world and to drastically reduce their residents' activities, decisions which are likely to increase loneliness in residents. To investigate this issue, we evaluated loneliness in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) living in retirement homes in France during the COVID-19 crisis. The study included 63 participants with mild AD. Participants were invited to complete the following statement ""During the social distancing, I feel"" with one of the three options: not at all alone, somewhat alone, or very alone. Most of the participants answered ""somewhat alone"", suggesting a significant level of loneliness during the crisis. While it serves to prevent infections, social distancing in retirement homes is likely to result in significant loneliness in residents. Because loneliness may increase cognitive decline in AD, it to pressing to prepare social programs/activities that promote contact between residents of retirement homes and the outside world as soon as the confinement is lifted.","El Haj, M; Gallouj, K",Encephale,,259

Endoscopic diagnosis and treatment constitute an irreplaceable part in the handling of severe COVID-19 cases. Endoscopes, as reusable precision instruments with complicated structures, require more techniques than other medical devices in cleaning, disinfection, sterilization, and other reprocessing procedures. From 2016 to 2019, health care-acquired infection caused by improper endoscope reprocessing has always been among the top 5 on the list of top 10 health technology hazards issued by the Emergency Care Research Institute. Considering the highly infective nature of COVID-19 and the potential aerosol contamination therefrom, it is of pivotal significance to ensure that endoscopes are strictly reprocessed between uses. In accordance with the national standard ""Regulation for Cleaning and Disinfection Technique of Flexible Endoscope (WS507-2016),"" we improved the workflow of endoscope reprocessing including the selection of chemicals in an effort to ensure quality control throughout the clinical management towards COVID-19 patients.

The COVID19 pandemic has made it necessary to abruptly adjust outpatient care methods in various medical settings that needlessly require consultations in person to monitor and change the disease management of patients in specific risk groups. People with diabetes represent a vulnerable population who need to be protected from avoidable outpatient clinic visits, particularly in times of influenza or other pandemic outbreaks. However, the treatment and care of patients with diabetes and its comorbidities require careful and regular monitoring and therapy adjustments by medical staff. Advanced age or cognitive impairment and insufficient access to the health care system due to low socioeconomic status can complicate the use of possible alternatives to in-person consultations in outpatient clinics or physicians' offices. Telemedicine solutions may offer suitable alternatives to standard face-to-face consultations in outpatient settings and provide sufficient access to appropriate diabetes care. Nevertheless, telemedicine methods for monitoring diabetes issues are yet to find widespread use due to numerous barriers, such as a lack of acceptance and doubt about its time- and cost-effectiveness, availability, and potential technical and regulatory issues. This article offers an overview of existing applications that provide telemedicine diabetes care. Furthermore, it discusses potential ways to restructure and revolutionize diabetes outpatient care.","Aberer, Felix; Hochfellner, Daniel A; Mader, Julia K",,,259

To better understand the immune alterations that determined poor vaccine response, we correlated quantities of circulating T and B cell subsets at baseline with longitudinal serologic responses to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination in heart and lung transplant recipients. MethodsSamples at baseline and at approximately 8 and 30 days after each vaccine dose for 22 heart and lung transplant recipients with no history of COVID-19, four heart and lung transplant recipients with prior COVID-19 infection, and 12 healthy controls undergoing vaccination were analyzed. Anti-spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG and pseudovirus neutralization activity were measured. Proportions of B and T cell subsets at baseline were comprehensively quantitated. ResultsAt 8-30 days post vaccination, healthy controls displayed robust anti-RBD IgG responses, whereas heart and lung transplant recipients showed minimally increased responses. A parallel absence of activity was observed in pseudovirus neutralization. In contrast, three of four (75%) transplant recipients with prior COVID-19 infection displayed robust responses at levels comparable to controls. Baseline levels of activated PD-1+ HLA-DR+ CXCR5- CD4+ T cells (also known as T peripheral helper [TPH] cells) and CD4+ T cells strongly predicted the ability to mount a response. ConclusionsImmunosuppressed patients have defective vaccine responses but can be induced to generate neutralizing antibodies after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Strong correlations of vaccine responsiveness with baseline TPH and CD4+ T cell numbers highlights a role for T helper activity in B cell differentiation into antibody secreting cells during vaccine response.","Lemieux, Jacob E.; Li, Amy; Gentili, Matteo; Perugino, Cory A.; Weiss, Zoe F.; Bowman, Kathryn; Ankomah, Pierre; Liu, Hang; Lewis, Gregory D.; Bitar, Natasha; Lipiner, Taryn; Hacohen, Nir; Pillai, Shiv S.; Goldberg, Marcia B.",,,259

This study evaluated variations in the treatment of coronary artery disease according to time course of the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan.MethodsâandâResults:The Japanese Association of Cardiovascular Intervention and Therapeutics performed serial surveys during the pandemic (in mid-April, late-April and mid-May 2020) with queries regarding the implementation of PCI. Hospitals were asked about their treatment strategies for elective PCI and emergency PCI for ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and high-risk acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients. Most hospitals opted to perform primary PCI in the usual manner at the beginning of the pandemic. As the pandemic progressed, hospitals in the 7 populated areas downgraded the performance of PCI for chronic coronary syndrome and high-risk ACS, but not for STEMI patients. After the state of emergency was lifted in most prefectures in mid-May, the rate of PCI gradually normalized. Screening tests, such as polymerase chain reaction and chest computed tomography, in ACS were frequently used. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic greatly affected PCI treatment in Japan. However, even in the most critical situations during the pandemic, most institutions continued to perform primary PCI normally for STEMI patients.","Ishii, Hideki; Amano, Tetsuya; Yamaji, Kyohei; Kohsaka, Shun; Yokoi, Hiroyoshi; Ikari, Yuji",Circ J,,259

Studies have shown promising results for detection of COVID-19 from viral bacterial pneumonia in chest X-rays. Automation of COVID-19 testing using medical images can speed up the testing process of patients where health care systems lack sufficient numbers of the reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction tests. Supervised deep learning models such as convolutional neural networks need enough labeled data for all classes to correctly learn the task of detection. Gathering labeled data is a cumbersome task and requires time and resources which could further strain health care systems and radiologists at the early stages of a pandemic such as COVID-19. In this study, we propose a randomized generative adversarial network (RANDGAN) that detects images of an unknown class (COVID-19) from known and labelled classes (Normal and Viral Pneumonia) without the need for labels and training data from the unknown class of images (COVID-19). We used the largest publicly available COVID-19 chest X-ray dataset, COVIDx, which is comprised of Normal, Pneumonia, and COVID-19 images from multiple public databases. In this work, we use transfer learning to segment the lungs in the COVIDx dataset. Next, we show why segmentation of the region of interest (lungs) is vital to correctly learn the task of classification, specifically in datasets that contain images from different resources as it is the case for the COVIDx dataset. Finally, we show improved results in detection of COVID-19 cases using our generative model (RANDGAN) compared to conventional generative adversarial networks for anomaly detection in medical images, improving the area under the ROC curve from 0.71 to 0.77.","Motamed, Saman; Rogalla, Patrik; Khalvati, Farzad",Sci Rep,,259

412364,Association Between Bitter Taste Receptor Phenotype and Clinical Outcomes Among Patients With COVID-19,2021,"PURPOSE: Fewer attendances for radiation therapy results in increased efficiency and less foot traffic within a radiation therapy department. We investigated outcomes after single-fraction (SF) stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in patients with oligometastatic disease. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between February 2010 and June 2019, patients who received SF SBRT to 1 to 5 sites of oligometastatic disease were included in this retrospective study. The primary objective was to describe patterns of first failure after SBRT. Secondary objectives included overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), high-grade treatment-related toxicity (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grade &#8805;3), and freedom from systemic therapy (FFST). RESULTS: In total, 371 patients with 494 extracranial oligometastases received SF SBRT ranging from 16 Gy to 28 Gy. The most common primary malignancies were prostate (n = 107), lung (n = 63), kidney (n = 52), gastrointestinal (n = 51), and breast cancers (n = 42). The median follow-up was 3.1 years. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS was 93%, 69%, and 55%, respectively; PFS was 48%, 19%, and 14%, respectively; and FFST was 70%, 43%, and 35%, respectively. Twelve patients (3%) developed grade 3 to 4 treatment-related toxicity, with no grade 5 toxicity. As the first site of failure, the cumulative incidence of local failure (irrespective of other failures) at 1, 3 and 5 years was 4%, 8%, and 8%, respectively; locoregional relapse at the primary was 10%, 18%, and 18%, respectively; and distant failure was 45%, 66%, and 70%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: SF SBRT is safe and effective, and a significant proportion of patients remain FFST for several years after therapy. This approach could be considered in resource-constrained or bundled-payment environments. Locoregional failure of the primary site is the second most common pattern of failure, suggesting a role for optimization of primary control during metastasis-directed therapy.","Sogono, Paolo; Bressel, Mathias; David, Steven; Shaw, Mark; Chander, Sarat; Chu, Julie; Plumridge, Nikki; Byrne, Keelan; Hardcastle, Nicholas; Kron, Tomas; Wheeler, Greg; Hanna, Gerard G; MacManus, Michael; Ball, David; Siva, Shankar",Int. j. radiat. oncol. biol. phys,,259

The purpose of this study was to determine if the mode of ventilation at the time of CDH repair affected mortality or oxygen dependence at 28 days. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of infants born wih CDH from 1991 to 2015. A generalized linear model was applied to the data using a propensity score analysis. RESULTS: Eighty patients met the inclusion criteria; at the time of surgery 39 (48.8%) patients were on HFV and 41 (51.3%) patients were on CMV. In the HFV group, 16 (47.1%) patients remained oxygen dependent and there were 5 (12.8%) deaths at 28 days. In the CMV group, 5 (12.2%) patients remained oxygen dependent at 28 days but none had died. The base model demonstrated that the HFV group had increased rates of oxygen dependence [OR = 6.40 (2.13, 22.2), p = 0.002].

413399,Keeping pace: An ED communications strategy for COVID-19,2020,"Observational studies of the effectiveness of vaccines to prevent COVID-19 are needed to inform real-world use. Such studies are now underway amid the ongoing rollout of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines globally. Although traditional case-control and test-negative design studies feature prominently among strategies used to assess vaccine effectiveness, such studies may encounter important threats to validity. Here, we review the theoretical basis for estimation of vaccine direct effects under traditional case-control and test-negative design frameworks, addressing specific natural history parameters of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 relevant to these designs. Bias may be introduced by misclassification of cases and controls, particularly when clinical case criteria include common, nonspecific indicators of COVID-19. When using diagnostic assays with high analytical sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 detection, individuals testing positive may be counted as cases even if their symptoms are due to other causes. The traditional case-control design may be particularly prone to confounding due to associations of vaccination with healthcare-seeking behavior or risk of infection. The test-negative design reduces but may not eliminate this confounding, for instance, if individuals who receive vaccination seek care or testing for less-severe illness. These circumstances indicate the two study designs cannot be applied naively to datasets gathered through public health surveillance or administrative sources. We suggest practical strategies to reduce bias in vaccine effectiveness estimates at the study design and analysis stages.","Lewnard, Joseph A; Patel, Manish M; Jewell, Nicholas P; Verani, Jennifer R; Kobayashi, Miwako; Tenforde, Mark W; Dean, Natalie E; Cowling, Benjamin J; Lopman, Benjamin A",Epidemiology,,259

414530,Extending the clinical spectrum of thrombotic thrombocytopenic syndrome attributable to adenovirus-based vaccines for Covid-19,2021,"The decision of whether or not to vaccinate is a complex one. It involves the contribution both to a social good -- herd immunity -- and to one's own well being. It is informed by social influence, personal experience, education, and mass media. In our work, we investigate a situation in which individuals make their choice based on how social neighbourhood responded to previous epidemics. We do this by proposing a minimalistic model using components from game theory, network theory and the modelling of epidemic spreading, and opinion dynamics. Individuals can use the information about the neighbourhood in two ways -- either they follow the majority or the best-performing neighbour. Furthermore, we let individuals learn which of these two decision-making strategies to follow from their experience. Our results show that the flexibility of individuals to chose how to integrate information from the neighbourhood increases the vaccine uptake and decreases the epidemic severity if the following conditions are fulfilled. First, the initial fraction of individuals who imitate the neighbourhood majority should be limited, and second, the memory of previous outbreaks should be sufficiently long. These results have implications for the acceptance of novel vaccines and raising awareness about vaccination, while also pointing to promising future research directions.","Miyoshi, Soya; Jusup, Marko; Holme, Petter",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.00443v1.pdf,259

MATERIALS AND METHODS: From March 11 to April 20, 2020, 57 SARS-CoV-2 positive patients were retrospectively compared: group T (n = 30) receiving tocilizumab and group non-T (n = 27) undergoing only antivirals/antimalarials. Chest-CT and laboratory findings were analyzed before and after treatment. CT evaluation included both semiquantitative scoring and texture analysis of all parenchymal lesions. Survival and recovery analyses were also provided with Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: In group T, no significant differences were found for CT score after treatment, while several texture features significantly changed, including mean attenuation (p < 0.0001), skewness (p < 0.0001), entropy (p = 0.0146) and higher-order parameters, suggesting considerable fading of parenchymal lesions. PaO2/FiO2 mean value significantly increased after treatment, from 240 ± 93 to 363 ± 107 (p = 0.0003), with parallel decrease in inflammatory biomarkers (CRP, D-dimer and LDH). In group non-T, CT scoring, texture and laboratory parameters showed significant worsening at follow-up. Findings were clinically associated with opposite trends between two groups, with reduction of severe cases in group T (from 21/30 to 5/30; p < 0.0001) as compared to a significant worsening in group non-T (severe cases increasing from 6/27 to 14/27; p = 0.0473). Probability of discharge was significantly higher in group T (p < 0.0001), as well as survival rate, although not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest the potential role of CT texture analysis for assessing response to treatment in COVID-19 pneumonia, using Tocilizumab, as compared to semiquantitative evaluation, providing insight into the intrinsic parenchymal changes.","Masci, Giorgio Maria; Iafrate, Franco; Ciccarelli, Fabio; Pambianchi, Giacomo; Panebianco, Valeria; Pasculli, Patrizia; Ciardi, Maria Rosa; Mastroianni, Claudio Maria; Ricci, Paolo; Catalano, Carlo; Francone, Marco",,,259

As a result, methods and techniques for preventing environmental contagious, such as ventilation or air filtration have been proposed. Here, it is investigated the effect of moisturization on airborne COVID-19 transmission from a mechanical point of view in which comparatively large water droplets promote the growth -by collision and coalescence, of suspended airborne COVID-19 and then accelerating its gravitational settling. Utilizing a classical raindrop collisional model from cloud science and the available experimental data an expression for the removal time of suspended airborne COVID-19 as function of the relative humidity was derived. The mechanical model is in good agreement with the recent reported experimental research in which high temperature and high relative humidity reduce COVID-19 contagious and then is a point in favor of the mechanic model of the effect of moisture in the COVID-19 airborne transmission. The results encourage further research on the deliberate moisturization of room air (by using ceiling mounted humidifiers) as a potential technique for control of airborne COVID-19 transmission.","Arias, Francisco J; De Las Heras, Salvador",Environ Res,,259

RT-qPCR tests for detection of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent for COVID-19, are ideal in a hospital environment. However, mass testing requires cheaper and simpler tests, especially in settings that lack sophisticated machinery. The most common current diagnostic method is based on nasopharyngeal sample collection, RNA extraction, and RT-qPCR for amplification and detection of viral nucleic acids. Here, we show that samples obtained from nasopharyngeal swabs in VTM and in saliva can be used with or without RNA purification in an isothermal loop-mediated amplification (LAMP)-based assay, with 60-93% sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 detection as compared to standard RT-qPCR tests. A series of simple modifications to standard RT-LAMP published methods to stabilize pH fluctuations due to salivary acidity resulted in a significant improvement in reliability, opening new avenues for efficient, low-cost testing of COVID-19 infection.","Uribe-Alvarez, Cristina; Lam, Quynh; Baldwin, Don A; Chernoff, Jonathan",PLoS One,,259

However, CO2 reduction is necessary to increase its energy content. Hydrosilane is a potential reducing agent that exhibits excellent reactivity under ambient conditions. CO2 hydrosilylation yields versatile products such as silylformate and methoxysilane, whereas formamides and N-methylated products are obtained in the presence of amines. In these transformations, organocatalysts are considered as the more sustainable choice of catalyst. In particular, heterogeneous organocatalysts featuring precisely designed active sites offer higher efficiency due to their recyclability. Herein, an overview is presented of the current development of basic organocatalysts immobilized on various supports for application in the chemical reduction of CO2 with hydrosilanes, and the potential active species parameters that might affect the catalytic activity are identified.","Pramudita, Ria Ayu; Motokura, Ken","ChemSusChem (Weinh., Internet)",,259

BNT162b2 is a lipid nanoparticle formulated nucleoside-modified messenger RNA (mRNA) encoding the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein locked in its prefusion conformation. A developmental and reproductive toxicity study was conducted in rats according to international regulatory guidelines. The full human BNT162b2 dose of 30 µg mRNA/dose (>300 times the human dose on a mg/kg basis) was administered intramuscularly to 44 female rats 21 and 14 days prior to mating and on gestation days 9 and 20. Half of the rats were subject to cesarean section and full fetal examination at the end of gestation, and the other half were allowed to deliver and were monitored to the end of lactation. A robust neutralizing antibody response was confirmed prior to mating and at the end of gestation and lactation. The presence of neutralizing antibodies was also confirmed in fetuses and offspring. Nonadverse effects, related to the local injection site reaction, were noted in dams as expected from other animal studies and consistent with observations in humans. There were no effects of BNT162b2 on female mating performance, fertility, or any ovarian or uterine parameters nor on embryo-fetal or postnatal survival, growth, physical development or neurofunctional development in the offspring through the end of lactation. Together with the safety profile in nonpregnant people, this ICH-compliant nonclinical safety data supports study of BNT162b2 in women of childbearing potential and pregnant and lactating women.","Bowman, Christopher J; Bouressam, Marie; Campion, Sarah N; Cappon, Gregg D; Catlin, Natasha R; Cutler, Mark W; Diekmann, Jan; Rohde, Cynthia M; Sellers, Rani S; Lindemann, Claudia",Reprod Toxicol,,259

Hospitalization was required in 26% of the participants, and 4% died. Patients who were hospitalized were significantly more likely to be older (P < 0.001) and have comorbid hypertension (P = 0.001) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (P = 0.02). IA patients taking oral glucocorticoids had an increased likelihood of being admitted for COVID-19 (P < 0.001), while those receiving maintenance anticytokine biologic therapies did not. CONCLUSION: Among patients with underlying IA, COVID-19 outcomes were worse in those receiving glucocorticoids but not in patients receiving maintenance anticytokine therapy. Further work is needed to understand whether immunomodulatory therapies affect COVID-19 incidence.","Haberman, Rebecca H; Castillo, Rochelle; Chen, Alan; Yan, Di; Ramirez, Deborah; Sekar, Vaish; Lesser, Robert; Solomon, Gary; Neimann, Andrea L; Blank, Rebecca B; Izmirly, Peter; Webster, Dan E; Ogdie, Alexis; Troxel, Andrea B; Adhikari, Samrachana; Scher, Jose U",Arthritis rheumatol.

427281,[Infection Control: The Roles and Functions of Nurses Working at the International Medical Center],2020,"GNNs have been proven to perform highly effective in various node-level, edge-level, and graph-level prediction tasks in several domains. Existing approaches mainly focus on static graphs. However, many graphs change over time with their edge may disappear, or node or edge attribute may alter from one time to the other. It is essential to consider such evolution in representation learning of nodes in time varying graphs. In this paper, we propose a Temporal Multilayered Position-aware Graph Neural Network (TMP-GNN), a node embedding approach for dynamic graph that incorporates the interdependence of temporal relations into embedding computation. We evaluate the performance of TMP-GNN on two different representations of temporal multilayered graphs. The performance is assessed against the most popular GNNs on node-level prediction tasks. Then, we incorporate TMP-GNN into a deep learning framework to estimate missing data and compare the performance with their corresponding competent GNNs from our former experiment, and a baseline method. Experimental results on four real-world datasets yield up to 58% of lower ROC AUC for pairwise node classification task, and 96% of lower MAE in missing feature estimation, particularly for graphs with a relatively high number of nodes and lower mean degree of connectivity.","Najafi, Bahareh; Parsaeefard, Saeedeh; Leon-Garcia, Alberto",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.03400v1.pdf,259
427661,"COVID-19: The Waterloo of governments, healthcare systems, and large health organizations",2020,"Representation learning on temporal interaction graphs (TIG) is to model complex networks with the dynamic evolution of interactions arising in a broad spectrum of problems. Existing dynamic embedding methods on TIG discretely update node embeddings merely when an interaction occurs. They fail to capture the continuous dynamic evolution of embedding trajectories of nodes. In this paper, we propose a two-module framework named ConTIG, a continuous representation method that captures the continuous dynamic evolution of node embedding trajectories. With two essential modules, our model exploit three-fold factors in dynamic networks which include latest interaction, neighbor features and inherent characteristics. In the first update module, we employ a continuous inference block to learn the nodes' state trajectories by learning from time-adjacent interaction patterns between node pairs using ordinary differential equations. In the second transform module, we introduce a self-attention mechanism to predict future node embeddings by aggregating historical temporal interaction information. Experiments results demonstrate the superiority of ConTIG on temporal link prediction, temporal node recommendation and dynamic node classification tasks compared with a range of state-of-the-art baselines, especially for long-interval interactions prediction.","Yan, Xu; Fan, Xiaoliang; Yang, Peizhen; Wu, Zonghan; Pan, Shirui; Chen, Longbiao; Zang, Yu; Wang, Cheng",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.06088v1.pdf,259

428283,A Prospective Analysis of PTSD Development in Admitted COVID-19 Patients in Indian Scenario,2021,"Global health emergencies such as Covid-19 have highlighted the importance of access to nature and open spaces in our cities for social, physical, and mental health. However, there continues to be a disconnect between our need for nature and our daily lived experience. Recent research indicates that our connectedness and relationship with nature, and in particular biophilic design, may be key for improving both health and quality of life. Rather than relying on abstract universal ideas of “nature”, using evidence-based biophilic design and policy at a building, neighborhood, and city scale, to link our daily lives with biodiversity, may encourage sense of place and make environmental action more meaningful. Then, improving our natural capital in the urban built environment might help address the current climate and disease crisis, as well as improving our physical and mental health. Drawing from emerging research and innovative practice, the paper describes key research and design paradigms that influence the way we understand the benefits of nature for different environments, including the workplace, neighborhood, and city, and explains where biophilic design theory sits in this field. Examples from recent research carried out in London and Chicago are provided, aiming at demonstrating what kind of research can be functional to what context, followed by a detailed analysis of its application supporting both human and ecological health. The study concludes indicating key policy and design lessons learned around regenerative design and biophilia as well as new directions for action, particularly with regard to climate change, sense of place, and well-being. © 2021 by the authors.

However, the distinct alterations of molecules involved in the death pathways and drug effects targeting inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) have not been extensively characterized in HPV(+) HNSCC cells. In this study, we observed the distinct genomic and expression alterations of nine genes involved in cell death in 55% HNSCC tissues, which were associated with HPV status, tumor staging, and anatomic locations. Expression of four genes was statistically correlated with copy number variation. A panel of HPV(+) HNSCC lines showed abundant TRAILR2 and IAP1 protein expression, but were not sensitive to IAP inhibitor birinapant alone, while combinatory treatment with TNF&#945; or especially TRAIL enhanced this drug sensitivity. The death agonistic TRAILR2 antibody alone showed no cell inhibitory effects, whereas its combination with birinapant and/or TRAIL protein demonstrated additive or synergistic effects. We observed predominantly late apoptosis mode of cell death after combinatorial treatments, and pan-caspase (ZVAD) and caspase-8 (ZIETD) inhibitors attenuated treatment-induced cell death. Our genomic and expression data-driven study provides a framework for identifying relevant combinatorial therapies targeting death pathways in HPV(+) HNSCC and other squamous cancer types.","An, Yi; Jeon, Jun; Sun, Lillian; Derakhshan, Adeeb; Chen, Jianhong; Carlson, Sophie; Cheng, Hui; Silvin, Christopher; Yang, Xinping; Van Waes, Carter; Chen, Zhong",Sci Rep,,259

431817,Attitudes to Vaccination After the First Wave of COVID-19,2021,"Chest computed tomography (CT) based analysis and diagnosis of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) plays a key role in combating the outbreak of the pandemic that has rapidly spread worldwide. To date, the disease has infected more than 18 million people with over 690k deaths reported. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the current gold standard for clinical diagnosis but may produce false positives; thus, chest CT based diagnosis is considered more viable. However, accurate screening is challenging due to the difficulty in annotation of infected areas, curation of large datasets, and the slight discrepancies between COVID-19 and other viral pneumonia. In this study, we propose an attention-based end-to-end weakly supervised framework for the rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 and bacterial pneumonia based on multiple instance learning (MIL). We further incorporate unsupervised contrastive learning for improved accuracy with attention applied both in spatial and latent contexts, herein we propose Dual Attention Contrastive based MIL (DA-CMIL). DA-CMIL takes as input several patient CT slices (considered as bag of instances) and outputs a single label. Attention based pooling is applied to implicitly select key slices in the latent space, whereas spatial attention learns slice spatial context for interpretable diagnosis. A contrastive loss is applied at the instance level to encode similarity of features from the same patient against representative pooled patient features. Empirical results show that our algorithm achieves an overall accuracy of 98.6% and an AUC of 98.4%. Moreover, ablation studies show the benefit of contrastive learning with MIL.","Chikontwe, Philip; Luna, Miguel; Kang, Myeongkyun; Hong, Kyung Soo; Ahn, June Hong; Park, Sang Hyun",Med Image Anal,,259

Methods: An online survey, which included a validated telehealth usability questionnaire, was offered via email to families with a telephone or virtual visit since the COVID-19-related cancellation of routine in-person care. Survey data was linked with the British Columbia (BC) Clinical Diabetes Registry. Outcomes between groups were assessed using Welch's t-test. Associations with type of visit as well as with desire to return to in-person care were assessed with logistic regression models. Results: The response rate was 47%. Of 141 survey respondents, 87 had clinical data available in the BC Clinical Diabetes Registry, and thus were included in our analysis. Overall, telephone and virtual visits were rated highly for usability. Telephone visits were easier to learn to use, and simpler to understand; however, telephone and virtual visits were similar across multiple areas. No factors associated with choosing one type of visit over the other, or with desire to return to in-person care, could be identified. 72% of participants want future telehealth care; however, some would like all future care to be in-person. Conclusions: Telephone and virtual visits had impressive usability.

Existing measures do not capture household experiences relevant to the pandemic, in which families are largely confined to their homes while sharing a life-threatening situation. Using best practice guidelines, we developed a pool of items and revised them with review by a panel of experts, and cognitive interviewing with community respondents. We administered the CHES by online survey to 3,965 adults. The CHES consists of 15 items for each of two subscales, household conflict (&#945; = .847) and household cohesion (&#945; = .887). Exploratory factor analysis yielded two factors, corresponding to the intended conflict and cohesion items, which accounted for 29% of variance. Confirmatory factor analysis partially supported the 2-factor model (RMSEA = .057; CFI = .729, TLI = .708, and SRMR = .098).

436518,INSPIRE: INvestigating Stellar Population In RElics II. First Data Release (DR1),2021-03-22,"PURPOSE: Due to the affinity of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 for the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, use of ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) has been a major concern for clinicians during the 2020 pandemic. Meta-analyses have affirmed that these agents do not worsen clinical outcomes in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. To date, only a limited number of studies have directly evaluated the safety of inpatient prescription of ACE inhibitors/ARBs during acute coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) illness. METHODS: A retrospective cohort analysis was conducted to investigate the impact of inpatient provision of ACE inhibitors/ARBs on morbidity and mortality in patients admitted to the hospital with COVID-19. Relationships were explored by using linear and logistic regression. FINDINGS: A total of 612 adult patients met the inclusion criteria, of whom 151 (24.7%) patients were established on ACE inhibitors/ARBs. Despite correction for known confounders, discontinuation of ACE inhibitors/ARBs was highly predictive of worsened outcomes in COVID-19. The proportion of doses omitted in the hospital was significantly associated with increased mortality (OR, 9.59; 95% CI, 2.55-36.09; P < 0.001), maximum National Early Warning Score 2 (OR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.27-2.17; P < 0.001), maximum oxygen requirements (OR, 3.00; 95% CI, 1.83-4.91; P < 0.001), and maximum C-reactive protein concentration (OR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.06-3.17; P = 0.030). IMPLICATIONS: Our data show a strong association between missed ACE inhibitor/ARB doses with increased morbidity and mortality. The available evidence supports continuation of currently accepted practice surrounding ACE inhibitor/ARB therapy in acute illness, which is to limit drug omission to established acute contraindications, to actively monitor such decisions, and to restart therapy as soon as it is safe to do so.

We evaluated the clinical status of COVID-19 survivors at three months after hospital discharge. METHODS: In this prospective observational cohort study, hospitalized patients aged &#8805;18 years, evaluated at one (M1) and three (M3) months post-discharge were enrolled. 251 patients (71.3% males, median [IQR] age 61.8 [53.5-70.7] years) were included. Median (IQR) time from discharge to M3 was 89 (79.5-101) days. Primary outcome was residual respiratory dysfunction (RRD), defined by tachypnea, moderate to very severe dyspnea, or peripheral oxygen saturation &#8804;95% on room air at M3. RESULTS: RRD was found in 30.4% of patients, with no significant difference compared with M1. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and length of stay were independent predictors of RRD at multivariable logistic regression (odds ratio, OR, [95% confidence interval, CI] 4.13 [1.17-16.88], p 0.033; OR [95% CI] 1.02 [1.00-1.04], p 0.047, respectively). Obesity and C-reactive protein levels upon admission were additional predictors at regression tree analysis. Impaired quality of life (QoL) was reported by 53.2% of patients. Anxiety and insomnia were each present in 25.5% of patients, and PTSD in 22.4%. No difference was found between M1 and M3 in QoL, anxiety or PTSD. Insomnia decreased at M3. Current major psychiatric disorder as well as anxiety, insomnia and PSTD at M1 independently predicted PTSD at M3.

Identifying phenotypes of ARDS and integrating this information into patient selection for clinical trials may increase the chance for efficacy with new treatments. In this review, we focus on classifying ARDS by the associated clinical disorders, physiological data, and radiographic imaging. We consider biologic phenotypes, including plasma protein biomarkers, gene expression, and common causative microbiologic pathogens. We will also discuss the issue of focusing clinical trials on the patient's phase of lung injury, including prevention, administration of therapy during early acute lung injury, and treatment of established ARDS. A more in depth understanding of the interplay of these variables in ARDS should provide more success in designing and conducting clinical trials and achieving the goal of personalized medicine.","Matthay, Michael A; Arabi, Yaseen M; Siegel, Emily R; Ware, Lorraine B; Bos, Lieuwe D J; Sinha, Pratik; Beitler, Jeremy R; Wick, Katherine D; Curley, Martha A Q; Constantin, Jean-Michel; Levitt, Joseph E; Calfee, Carolyn S",Intensive Care Med,,259

Of note, 26.5% of patients had a normal or unchanged chest x-ray report, with only 10.2% showing bilateral peripheral infiltrates. 28-day mortality was 37.1% with Covid-19 Disease listed as primary cause of death in 90.4%. Conclusion(s): Entering further “waves” of infection, it is vital that we understand the clinical presentation and course of Covid-19 disease in elderly patients. Our data highlights that any Covid-19 symptom, even in isolation, should raise suspicion of disease. Chest xrays should not be used alone as a diagnostic tool.The presence of lymphopenia should raise suspicion of Covid-19 infection. In developing an understanding of how elderly patients with Covid-19 present, we can ensure early identification and initiation of appropriate infection control measures.","Shedden, R.; McCulloch, A.; Laidlaw, S.; Love, S.; McLuckie, S.; Jones, W.; Taylor, J.; Pennington, R.; Tipton, C.",Age and Ageing,,259

444393,Association of Circulating Sex Hormones With Inflammation and Disease Severity in Patients With COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: Respiratory infections are a major threat for lung recipients. We aimed to compare with a monocentric study the impact of late viral and bacterial respiratory infections on the graft function. METHODS: Patients, who survived 6 months or more following lung transplantation that took place between 2009 and 2014, were classified into three groups: a viral infection group (VIG) (without any respiratory bacteria), a bacterial infection group (BIG) (with or without any respiratory viruses), and a control group (CG) (no documented infection). Chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) and acute rejection were analysed 6 months after the inclusion in the study. RESULTS: Among 99 included lung recipients, 57 (58%) had at least one positive virological respiratory sample during the study period. Patients were classified as follows: 38 in the VIG, 25 in the BIG (among which 19 co-infections with a virus) and 36 in the CG. The BIG presented a higher initial deterioration in lung function (p = 0.05) than the VIG. But 6 months after the infection, only the VIG presented a median decrease of forced expiratory volume in 1 s; - 35 mL (IQR; - 340; + 80) in the VIG, + 140 mL (+ 60;+ 330) in the BIG and + 10 (- 84;+ 160) in the CG, p < 0.01. Acute rejection was more frequent in the VIG (n = 12 (32%)), than the BIG (n = 6 (24%)) and CG (n = 3 (8%)), p < 0.05, despite presenting no more CLAD (p = 0.21). CONCLUSIONS: Despite a less severe initial presentation, single viral respiratory infections seem to lead to a greater deterioration in lung function, and to more acute rejection, than bacterial infections.","Dubert, Marie; Visseaux, Benoit; Birgy, André; Mordant, Pierre; Metivier, Anne-Cécile; Dauriat, Gaelle; Fidouh, Nadhira; Yazdanpanah, Yazdan; Grall, Nathalie; Castier, Yves; Mal, Hervé; Thabut, Gabriel; Lescure, François-Xavier",BMC Infect Dis,,259

This is the first study from a Croatian tertiary care hospital describing epidemiology, risk factors and species distribution in patients with candidemia. A three-year retrospective observational study, from 2018 to 2020, was performed at the University Hospital Centre Zagreb, Zagreb, Croatia. A total of 160 patients with candidemia (n = 170 isolates) were enrolled. Candidemia incidence increased from 0.47 to 0.69 per 1000 admissions in 2018 and 2020, respectively. Ninety-five patients (58.38%) were in the intensive care unit. The main risk factors for candidemia were central venous catheter (CVC) (84.38%), previous surgical procedure (56.88%) and invasive mechanical ventilation (42.50%). Candida albicans was identified in 43.53% of isolates, followed by C. parapsilosis (31.76%) and C. glabrata (12.36%), C. krusei (5.29%), C. tropicalis (2.35%) and C. lusitaniae (2.35%). The study discovered a shift to non-albicansCandida species, particularly C. parapsilosis, and made it possible to determine the main tasks we should focus on to prevent candidemia in the hospital, these being mainly infection control measures directed towards prevention of catheter-related bloodstream infections, specifically comprising hand hygiene and CVC bundles of care. The potential benefit of fluconazole prophylaxis in certain populations of surgical patients could also be considered.","Marekovic, Ivana; Plesko, Sanja; Rezo Vranjes, Violeta; Herljevic, Zoran; Kulis, Tomislav; Jandrlic, Marija",,,259

Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine is developed from live-attenuated Mycobacterium bovis, which is a microorganism found in a cow. Discovered by Dr. Albert Calmette and Camille Guérin since 1921, the BCG has served as a protection against tuberculosis and its complications. It is noticeable that countries which use mandatory BCG vaccination approach had lower COVID-19 infection and death rate. Current review aims to clarify this issue through epidemiological illustration of correlation between national BCG immunization and COVID-19 mortality, in addition to biological background of BCG-induced immunity Epidemiological data shows that universal BCG policy countries have lower median mortality rate compare to countries with past universal BCG policy and non-mass immunization BCG. (18 May 2020). Still, the links between BCG vaccination and better COVID-19 situation in certain countries are unclear, and more data on actual infection rate using SAR-CoV-2 antibody testing in large population sample is crucial for disease spreading comparison. Two immunological mechanisms, heterologous effects of adaptive immunity and trained innate immunity which induced by BCG vaccination, may explain host tolerance against COVID-19 infection, however, there is no direct evidence to support this biological background. Clinical trials related to BCG vaccination against COVID-19 are under investigation. Without a strong evidence, BCG must not be recommended for COVID-19 prevention, although, this should not be absolute contraindication. Risk of local and systemic complications from the vaccine should be informed to individual, who request BCG immunization.","Charoenlap, Suvanee; Piromsopa, Krerk; Charoenlap, Chris",Asian Pac J Allergy Immunol,,259

To investigate the direct/total bilirubin ratio (D/TBil), as a novel parameter, to predict the poor survival of COVID-19 Pneumonia. METHODS: The clinical characteristics and laboratory parameters of hospitalised COVID-19 pneumonia patients were analysed from 20 March to August 1, 2020, in a tertiary hospital, retrospectively. All remarkable variables were selected for a forward stepwise binary logistic regression analysis to define the independent risk factors for mortality. RESULTS: 537 (248 women and 289 men) patients were separated into two groups for analysis: survivors vs deceased. The mean age of the deceased group was statistically significantly higher than the survivor group 72 (30-92) years vs 50 (18-97) years (P < .001). D/TBil, age, gender, hypertension and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) variables contributed significantly to the binary logistic regression model. The mortality risk increased 14.6 times in patients with D/TBil > 0.5, and 2.4 times in patients with NLR > 4. CONCLUSION: D/TBil > 0.5 was associated with a novel parameter to poor survival of COVID-19 on admission. Also, the combination of age, gender, the presence of hypertension, D/TBil and NLR contributed significantly to predicting the poor survival of COVID-19.","Araç, Songül; Özel, Mehmet",Int J Clin Pract,,259

It being a communicable disease, the best way to control the disease is to prevent its spread. Lockdown in India has resulted in aesthetic practices all over the country being shut down indefinitely. As things return to normal, most aesthetic practitioners are looking forward to opening practices. Hence, there was a definite need for a consensus on how to safely open up practices in India and at the same time reassure patients coming into these clinics that their safety is paramount. Methods: This consensus guidelines use the PICO model in its structure. Five critical areas for opening up clinical establishments were identified and approached independently. A questionnaire was prepared using the modified Likert scale, and all the stakeholders were asked to answer the same. Any differences were then resolved with discussion among the stakeholders. The entire study was divided into five subgroups which were then analyzed in detail. Results: Key recommendations and consensus guidelines were made after detailed analysis. Handy flow diagram reviews of these key areas have been provided. A thorough review of literature was also done on each of the critical areas and recommendations incorporated wherever feasible. Conclusion: These recommendations have considered the difficulties and cultural issues faced by aesthetic practices in India. They are user friendly, easy to understand and imple-ment. These guidelines would help in reassuring practices to open up safely and continue serving patients with utmost care.

A multitude of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) detection assays with disparate gene targets, including automated high-throughput platforms, are available. Varying concordance and interpretation of diagnostic results in this setting can result in significant reporting delays, leading to suboptimal disease management. This article reports the development of a novel ORF1a-based SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay - Viroselect - that shows high concordance with conventional assays and the ability to resolve inconclusive results generated during the peak of the epidemic in Mumbai, India. METHODS: A unique target region within SARS-CoV-2 ORF1a - the non-structural protein 3 (nsp3) region - was used to design and develop the assay. This hypervariable region (1923-3956) between SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus was utilized to design the primers and probes for the RT-PCR assay. The concordance of this assay with commonly used emergency use authorization (US Food and Drug Administration) manual kits and an automated high-throughput testing platform was evaluated. Further, a retrospective analysis was carried out using Viroselect on samples reported as 'inconclusive' between April and October 2020. RESULTS: In total, 701 samples were tested. Concordance analysis of 477 samples demonstrated high overall agreement of Viroselect with both manual (87.6%) and automated (84.7%) assays. Also, in the retrospective analysis of 224 additional samples reported as 'inconclusive', Viroselect was able to resolve 100% (19/19) and 93.7% (192/205) of samples which had inconclusive results on manual and automated high-throughput platforms, respectively. CONCLUSION: Viroselect had high concordance with conventional assays, both manual and automated, and has potential to resolve inconclusive samples.","Jawade, Ketki; Sinha, Akhauri Yash; Bhagat, Sharad; Bhowmick, Shilpa; Chauhan, Bhagyashree; Kaginkar, Snehal; Palav, Harsha; Kasarpalkar, Nandini; Devadiga, Pratik; Karandikar, Kalyani; Agrawal, Sachee; Shastri, Jayanthi; Munne, Kiran; Bhor, Vikrant M; Mahale, Smita D; Bhowmik, Subhanjan; Jagtap, Dhanashree; Patel, Vainav",Int J Infect Dis,,259

Nigella sativa L. (Ranunculaceae) is an annual flowering plant used traditionally as a natural food supplement and multipurpose medicinal agent. OBJECTIVE: The possible beneficial effects of N. sativa, and its constituent, thymoquinone (TQ) on COVID-19 were reviewed. METHODS: The key words including, COVID-19, N. sativa, thymoquinone, antiviral effects, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects in different databases such as Web of Science (ISI), PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar were searched from 1990 up to February 2021. RESULTS: The current literature review showed that N. sativa and TQ reduced the level of pro-inflammatory mediators including, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, and IL-12, while enhancing IFN-Î³. Nigella sativa and TQ increased the serum levels of IgG1 and IgG2a, and improved pulmonary function tests in restrictive respiratory disorders. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary data of molecular docking, animal, and clinical studies propose N. sativa and TQ might have beneficial effects on the treatment or control of COVID-19 due to antiviral, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties as well as bronchodilatory effects. The efficacy of N. sativa and TQ on infected patients with COVID-19 in randomize clinical trials will be suggested.","Khazdair, Mohammad Reza; Ghafari, Shoukouh; Sadeghi, Mahmood",Pharm Biol,,259

METHODS: Among 3 PPE kits (simple, Level D, and Level C), 30 participants conducted the first simulation in their adapted way and the second following enhanced protocols. After donning, participants performed a 1-minute simulation of direct care on a patient simulator covered with fluorescent powder. For tracking contamination routes between doffing processes, fluorescent powder contamination was examined with ultraviolet lamps in the darkened room. RESULTS: Participants were mostly registered nurses (Nâ¯=â¯27, 90%), female (87%), and on average 31.7 years old with 8.5 years of clinical experience. Among 61 total simulations, 32 had at least 1 contamination (52.5%); ""Noticeable"" level (40%) at the ""hands-fingers"" and ""shirt"" body areas were most frequent. For first and second simulations with identical PPE kits, compared to the first with adapted practice, the second with enhanced protocols showed a significant reduction in doffing contamination rates (72.7% vs 22.7%, P = .0009 for both Level C and D; 77.8% vs 27.8%, P = .0027 for Level D).

459941,Hospital-in-the-Home experience of first 23 COVID-19 patients at a regional NSW hospital,2020,"&lt;p&gt;The 2019 novel coronavirus, or COVID-19, has rapidly spread across the world, and has since become not only a health problem but also a socioeconomic problem. In disaster-prone countries like Japan, there is substantial concern about the occurrence of natural disasters during the COVID-19 pandemic. When a natural disaster occurs, many people evacuate to shelters, and an outbreak of infectious disease often happens in shelters. In this situation, we should consider the management of evacuation shelters under this pandemic situation. Many types of research have investigated infectious diseases in shelters after a natural disaster. However, these are about infectious diseases after a disaster, and not about the occurrence of natural disasters under a pandemic like the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, such researches mainly focus on medical teams or local governments who respond to infectious diseases. Based on the above mentioned information, the purpose of this study is to clarify (i) the change in citizens’ awareness of risk influenced by the spread of COVID-19 and (ii) the measurement and decision necessary for evacuating people under COVID-19. We administered a questionnaire to Japanese citizens from April to May 2020, and found that majority of people do not want to have evacuation life under COVID-19, and this tendency is larger among people who live together with the aged and the care-needed. In addition, this research confirmed the risk awareness structure applicable to both COVID-19 and natural disasters. The results show that many people firmly ask governments to take measures against infectious disease such as using hotels as shelters, securing personal spaces in shelters, storing masks and disinfectors, and so on during an outbreak of an infectious disease. However, it is not enough to take such measures only;it is necessary to provide accurate information and mental support to reduce anxiety in people. Based on these results, we should consider more about the management of shelters under COVID-19 as soon as possible before the arrival of typhoon season.","Yasui, Arisa Numada Muneyoshi",Journal of Disaster Research,,259

460803,Letter to the Editor: Update on the followed-up CT exam of the first CoVID-19 pneumonia in Taiwan,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID pandemic and subsequent lockdown has disrupted food supplies across large parts of India, where even prior to the pandemic, food insecurity and malnutrition were widely prevalent. Tribal populations in southern Rajasthan, India, live in extreme scarcity, rely mainly on outward migration for sustenance, and have been significantly affected by the pandemic. In this study, we assess the availability of foodstuffs at the household level and community experiences about satiety and hunger during lockdown. METHODOLOGY: We conducted a rapid assessment of food security in rural southern Rajasthan, India, using a structured questionnaire. Trained interviewers conducted telephonic interviews using KoBoToolbox, an open-source tool. A total of 211 respondents including community volunteers, family members of tuberculosis patients and malnourished children, pregnant women, and influential members in the villages participated in the study. RESULTS: A cereal was reported to be present by 97% of the respondents, two-thirds had pulses, and nearly half had milk. The amount of cereals available was adequate for about 5 months and that of pulses, oil/ ghee, and sugar for about 1 to 2 weeks. Two-thirds of the respondents reported that food in their households was sometimes not sufficient for the amount they wanted to eat, and 97% of these mentioned not having money to buy food as the reason for not having sufficient food. CONCLUSION: The study highlights widespread food insecurity among tribal communities in southern Rajasthan, and the scenario is likely to be similar in other tribal migration dependent areas of the country.","Saxena, Anupriya; Amin, Arpita; Mohan, Sanjana Brahmawar; Mohan, Pavitra",Food Nutr Bull,,259

Evidence is beginning to emerge that this sophisticated technology offers new ways to improve the learning process for better interaction and engagement with students. Recently, AR has garnered much attention as an interactive technology that facilitates direct interaction with virtual objects in the real world. These virtual objects can be surrogates for real world teaching resources, allowing for virtual labs. Thus AR could allow learning experiences that would not be possible in impoverished educational systems around the world. Interestingly though, concepts such as virtual hand interaction and techniques such as machine learning are still not widely investigated in the domain of AR learning. The need for touchless interaction technologies has exceptionally increased in this post-COVID world. There are also existing pedagogical approaches that have not been explored in great detail in this new medium, such as Kinesthetic learning or ""Learning by Doing"". Using the touchless interaction hand interaction technology and machine learning agents, this research aims to address this gap by exploring these underutilised technologies to demonstrate the efficiency of AR learning. It will explore the different hand tracking APIs to integrate the virtual hand interaction, testing the devices' compatibility with these APIs and integrating machine learning agents using reinforcement learning to develop an AR learning framework that can provide more productive and interactive learning experiences. © 2021 Owner/Author.","Iqbal, M.

463947,Favipiravir induced nephrotoxicity in two patients of covid-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: Solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients are a complex, immunocompromised population in whom greater coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) mortality has been reported compared with the general population. METHODS: We examined a retrospective cohort of 58 SOT recipients with first-wave COVID-19, comparing patients with severe and nonsevere illness. Additionally, SOT recipients are compared with general patients with first-wave COVID-19. RESULTS: Organs transplanted included 38 kidneys, 8 livers, 5 hearts, and 3 pancreases. Average SOT recipient age was 57.4 years; 62% were male; 46.6% were African American 36.2% were white. Comorbidities included hypertension (86%), chronic kidney disease (86%), diabetes mellitus (50%), coronary artery disease (26%), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (14%). Twenty patients had severe COVID-19 (34.5%) and 38 had nonsevere disease (65.5%). Severe disease was more common in older SOT recipients with comorbidities and was associated with cough, dyspnea, pneumonia, C-reactive protein >10 mg/L, and platelet count <150/µL. Sex, race, body mass index, time from transplant, baseline immunosuppression, and diagnosis month did not differ among those with severe and nonsevere COVID-19. Seventy percent of SOT recipients were hospitalized vs 27.2% of general patients with COVID-19 and inpatient SOT recipients had a higher mechanical ventilation rate. Though a trend toward longer length of stay, higher intensive care unit admission, and greater inpatient mortality was observed (19.5% vs 14.8%), these differences were not significant. CONCLUSIONS: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has greatly impacted SOT recipients. One-third of our SOT recipients seen during the first wave had severe illness with associated standard risk factors for poor outcome. Compared with general first-wave patients, more SOT recipients were hospitalized, although inpatient COVID-19 mortality did not significantly differ.","Arya, Akanksha; Li, Michael; Aburjania, Nana; Singh, Pooja; Royer, Tricia; Moss, Sean; Belden, Katherine A",Transplant. proc,,259

We conducted a two-sample Mendelian randomization to clarify their role in COVID-19 risk and specific COVID-19 phenotypes (hospitalized and severe cases). METHOD: We identified genetic instruments for fasting glucose (n = 133,010), 2 h glucose (n = 42,854), glycated hemoglobin (n = 123,665), and type 2 diabetes (74,124 cases and 824,006 controls) from genome wide association studies and applied them to COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative summary statistics (17,965 COVID-19 cases and 1,370,547 population controls). We used inverse variance weighting to obtain the causal estimates of glycemic traits and genetic predisposition to type 2 diabetes in COVID-19 risk. Sensitivity analyses included MR-Egger and weighted median method. RESULTS: We found genetic predisposition to type 2 diabetes was not associated with any COVID-19 phenotype (OR: 1.00 per unit increase in log odds of having diabetes, 95%CI 0.97 to 1.04 for overall COVID-19; OR: 1.02, 95%CI 0.95 to 1.09 for hospitalized COVID-19; and OR: 1.00, 95%CI 0.93 to 1.08 for severe COVID-19). There were no strong evidence for an association of glycemic traits in COVID-19 phenotypes, apart from a potential inverse association for fasting glucose albeit with wide confidence interval. CONCLUSION: We provide some genetic evidence that poorer glycemic traits and predisposition to type 2 diabetes unlikely increase the risk of COVID-19. Although our study did not indicate glycemic traits increase severity of COVID-19, additional studies are needed to verify our findings.","Au Yeung, Shiu Lun; Zhao, Jie V; Schooling, C Mary",BMC Med,,259

468678,Metal-NHC heterocycle complexes in catalysis and biological applications: Systematic review,2020,"BACKGROUND: It is crucial that nursing homes have adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) and staff to protect residents and staff from COVID-19. Some states have taken actions to mitigate shortages of PPE and staffing in nursing homes, including creating dedicated long-term care (LTC) teams and supporting staffing capacity. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether state actions and nursing home characteristics are associated with shortages of PPE and staffing. DESIGN AND SETTING: Facility-level data, released July 31, 2020, from the Nursing Home COVID-19 Public File, were combined with data from other sources. Our sample was the 13,445 facilities with information about PPE and staffing shortages for each of the 5 weeks between the week ending June 21, 2020, and the week ending July 19, 2020. Associations between facility characteristics and shortages were examined using descriptive statistics and logistic regression models. MEASUREMENTS: Outcome variables were whether or not a facility lacked a 1-week supply of PPE (""PPE shortage"") and whether or not a facility had a staffing shortage during 1 or more weeks over the 5-week study period. RESULTS: Over the 5-week study period, 27.6% of facilities reported 1 or more weeks of PPE shortage, 30.2% of facilities reported at least 1 week of staffing shortage, and 46.5% of facilities lacked PPE and/or staff. Facilities located in states in the Northeast PPE Consortium or with LTC teams were modestly less likely to have had a PPE shortage, and facilities located in states that implemented processes to match job seekers with LTC facilities were marginally significantly less likely to have had a staffing shortage. CONCLUSION: Given that nearly half of U.S. nursing homes recently faced a shortage of PPE and/or staff, and that state budget deficits may limit further state actions, ongoing federal assistance with PPE and staffing of nursing homes is needed.","Gibson, Diane M; Greene, Jessica",J. am. geriatr. soc,,259

A systematic review was conducted to identify clinical trials of pharmacological interventions for COVID-19 published between 1 December 2019 and 14 October 2020. Data regarding efficacy of interventions, in terms of mortality, hospitalisation and need for ventilation, were extracted from identified studies and synthesised qualitatively. In total, 42 clinical trials were included. Interventions assessed included antiviral, mucolytic, antimalarial, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory therapies. Some reductions in mortality, hospitalisation and need for ventilation were seen with interferons and remdesivir, particularly when administered early, and with the mucolytic drug, bromhexine. Most studies of lopinavir/ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine did not show significant efficacy over standard care/placebo. Dexamethasone significantly reduced mortality, hospitalisation and need for ventilation versus standard care, particularly in patients with severe disease. Evidence for other classes of interventions was limited. Many trials had a moderate-to-high risk of bias, particularly in terms of blinding; most were short-term and some included low patient numbers.This review highlights the need for well-designed clinical trials of therapeutic interventions for COVID-19 to increase the quality of available evidence. It also emphasises the importance of tailoring interventions to disease stage and severity for maximum efficacy.","Welte, Tobias; Ambrose, Lucy J; Sibbring, Gillian C; Sheikh, Shehla; Müllerová, Hana; Sabir, Ian",,,259
470051,Methanol toxicity outbreak: when fear of COVID-19 goes viral,2020,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has fundamentally disrupted the practice of oncology, shifting care onto virtual platforms, rearranging the logistics and economics of running a successful clinical practice and research, and in some contexts, redefining what treatments patients with cancer should and can receive. Since the start of the pandemic in early 2020, there has been considerable emphasis placed on the implications for patients with cancer in terms of their vulnerability to the virus and potential exposure in healthcare settings. But little emphasis has been placed on the significant, and potentially enduring, consequences of COVID-19 for how cancer care is delivered. In this article, we outline the importance of a focus on the effects of COVID-19 for oncology practice during and potentially after the pandemic, focusing on key shifts that are already evident, including: the pivot to online consultations, shifts in access to clinical trial and definitions of ""essential care,"" the changing economics of practice, and the potential legacy effects of rapidly implemented changes in cancer care. COVID-19 is reshaping oncology practice, clinical trials, and delivery of cancer care broadly, and these changes might endure well beyond the short- to mid-term of the active pandemic. Therefore, shifts in practice brought about by the pandemic must be accompanied by improved training and awareness, enhanced infrastructure, and evidence-based support if they are to harness the positives and offset the potential negative consequences of the impacts of COVID-19 on cancer care.","Broom, Alex; Kenny, Katherine; Page, Alexander; Cort, Nicole; Lipp, Eric S; Tan, Aaron C; Ashley, David M; Walsh, Kyle M; Khasraw, Mustafa",Clin Cancer Res,,259

Crucially, recent findings suggest that this effect can be detected in bilingual infants before their first birthday indicating that it emerges as a result of early bilingual exposure and the experience of negotiating two linguistic systems in infants' environment. However, these conclusions are based on only two research studies from the last decade (Comishen, Bialystok, & Adler, 2019; Kovács & Mehler, 2009), so to date, there is a lack of evidence regarding their replicability and generalizability. In addition, previous research does not shed light on the precise aspects of bilingual experience and the extent of bilingual exposure underlying the emergence of this early bilingual advantage. The present study addressed these two questions by assessing attentional control abilities in 7-month-old bilingual infants in comparison to same-age monolinguals and in relation to their individual bilingual exposure patterns. Findings did not reveal significant differences between monolingual and bilingual infants in the measure of attentional control and no relation between individual performance and degree of bilingual exposure. Bilinguals showed different patterns of allocating attention to the visual rewards in this task compared to monolinguals. Thus, this study indicates that bilingualism modulates attentional processes early on, possibly as a result of bilinguals' experience of encoding dual-language information from a complex linguistic input, but it does not lead to significant advantages in attentional control in the first year of life.","Kalashnikova, Marina; Pejovic, Jovana; Carreiras, Manuel",Dev Sci,,259

In Spain, the State of Alarm was established for three months. This implied the interruption of educational activities, having a higher incidence for children, since teaching would not be resumed until the following academic year, in September. This, together with the confusing initial information about COVID-19 transmission between children and their families, has made them one of the groups most vulnerable. In this study, a qualitative approach is made to secondary school students (aged 12). They were asked to share their experiences about confinement from the perspective of the home spaces, in relation to two main tasks relevant in this period: the tele-study and their relaxing time and well-being. Using images and narratives with an abstract and emotional description, the response of 46 children was obtained. A sentiment analysis was carried out from their testimonies. Results suggest a greater availability of tele-study spaces with daylighting, mainly in bedrooms, with laptops. For leisure and rest spaces, sofas, beds, and cohabitant gathering were preferred. Written testimonials were mainly positive.

This analysis aimed to 1) assess characteristics, capability to detect and monitor COVID-19, and disease control measures in these 24 countries, 2) understand potential factors for the reported delayed COVID-19 introduction, and 3) identify gaps and opportunities for outbreak preparedness, particularly in low and middle-income countries (LMICs). We collected and analyzed publicly available information on country characteristics, COVID-19 testing, influenza surveillance, border measures, and preparedness activities in these countries. We also assessed the association between the temporal spread of COVID-19 in all countries with reported cases with globalization indicator and geographic location. RESULTS: Temporal spreading of COVID-19 was strongly associated with countries' globalization indicator and geographic location. Most of the 24 countries with delayed COVID-19 introduction were LMICs; 88% were small island or landlocked developing countries. As of 30 March 2020, only 38% of these countries reported in-country COVID-19 testing capability, and 71% reported conducting influenza surveillance during the past year. All had implemented two or more border measures, (e.g., travel restrictions and border closures) and multiple preparedness activities (e.g., national preparedness plans and school closing). CONCLUSIONS: Limited testing capacity suggests that most of the 24 delayed countries may have lacked the capability to detect and identify cases early through sentinel and case-based surveillance. Low global connectedness, geographic isolation, and border measures were common among these countries and may have contributed to the delayed introduction of COVID-19 into these countries. This paper contributes to identifying opportunities for pandemic preparedness, such as increasing disease detection, surveillance, and international collaborations. As the global situation continues to evolve, it is essential for countries to improve and prioritize their capacities to rapidly prevent, detect, and respond, not only for COVID-19, but also for future outbreaks.","Li, Zheng; Jones, Cynthia; Ejigu, Girum S; George, Nisha; Geller, Amanda L; Chang, Gregory C; Adamski, Alys; Igboh, Ledor S; Merrill, Rebecca D; Ricks, Philip; Mirza, Sara A; Lynch, Michael",Global Health,,259

(Special Issue: Mayo clinic strategies for COVID-19.)",2020,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had far reaching consequences on the health and well-being of the general public. Evidence from previous pandemics suggest that bariatric patients may experience increased emotional distress and difficulty adhering to healthy lifestyle changes post-surgery. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to examine the impact of the novel COVID-19 public health crisis on bariatric patients' self-management post-surgery. METHOD: In a nested-qualitative study, semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with 23 post-operative bariatric patients who had undergone Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) at a Canadian Bariatric Surgery Program between 2014 and 2020. A constant comparative approach was used to systematically analyze the data and identify the overarching themes. RESULTS: Participants (n = 23) had a mean age of (48.82 ± 10.03) years and most were female (n = 19). The median time post-surgery was 2 years (range: 6 months-7 years). Themes describing the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on patients' post-bariatric surgery self-management included: coping with COVID-19; vulnerability factors and physical isolation; resiliency factors during pandemic; and valuing access to support by virtual care. The need for patients to access post-operative bariatric care during COVID-19 differed based on gender and socioeconomic status. CONCLUSION: This study showed that the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted patients' ability to self-manage obesity and their mental health in a variety of ways. These findings suggest that patients may experience unique psychological distress and challenges requiring personalized care strategies to improve obesity self-care and overall well-being.","Youssef, Alaa; Cassin, Stephanie E; Wnuk, Susan; Leung, Samantha; Jackson, Timothy; Sockalingam, Sanjeev",Appetite,,259
475852,Tirofiban in emergency conditions: Systematic review,2021,"IntroductionPost-extubation dysphagia (PED) can have serious consequences for critically unwell patients. COVID-19 has resulted in an increasing need for a PED screen in order to effectively identify patients and mitigate risk, whilst balancing under-resourced services. Online training provides the advantage of reducing time pressures on staff and supporting social distancing. This project aimed to adapt the Leeds Post-Extubation Dysphagia Screen (L-PEDS) and the associated training package to be more suitable and effective for use during COVID-19 pandemic.MethodsThe screen was modified to a digital format with additional guidance for users. The training package was shortened and converted to an online package while keeping the interactive mode of training.ResultsPreliminary results of 14 staff members indicate that the median confidence levels for screening patients for PED improved from 5 to 8 (on a scale of 0 to 10) after completing the L-PEDS-COVID training package. Likewise, knowledge of PED improved from a median of 4 to 8 (on a scale of 0 to 10). Training quality was rated at a median of 8 on a scale of 0 to 10 (0 being very poor;10 being very good).ConclusionsPreliminary evidence demonstrated increased knowledge of PED and confidence in screening. The development of an adapted version of the L-PEDS and online training package may allow easier implementation of post-extubation dysphagia screening. This could help to compensate for insufficient speech and language therapy critical care staffing, assist in identifying patients at risk and improve outcomes by enabling earlier and safe resumption of oral intake.","Mills, Claire S.; Michou, Emilia Hanratty Andrea Gibson Abby Bellamy Mark C.",Journal of the Intensive Care Society,,259
476325,Weight Management and Healthy Lifestyles,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Motor neuron disease (MND) is a rapidly progressive and fatal neurodegenerative disorder with limited treatment options. The Motor Neuron Disease Systematic Multi-Arm Randomised Adaptive Trial (MND-SMART) is a multisite UK trial seeking to address the paucity in effective disease-modifying drugs for people with MND (pwMND). Historically, neurological trials have been plagued by suboptimal recruitment and high rates of attrition. Failure to recruit and/or retain participants can cause insufficiently representative samples, terminated trials or invalid conclusions. This study investigates patient-specific factors affecting recruitment and retention of pwMND to MND-SMART. Improved understanding of these factors may improve trial protocol design, optimise recruitment and retention. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: PwMND on the Scottish MND Register, Clinical Audit Research and Evaluation of MND (CARE-MND), will be invited to participate in a prospective observational cohort study that investigates factors affecting trial participation and attrition. We hypothesise that patient-specific factors will significantly affect trial recruitment and retention. Participants will complete the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, 9-Item Patient Health Questionnaire and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-Form Y to evaluate neuropsychiatric symptoms, the ALS-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire-Brief Form and Centre for Disease Control and Prevention-Health-Related Quality of Life for quality of life and a novel study-specific questionnaire on Attitudes towards Clinical Trial Participation (ACT-Q). Clinical data on phenotype, cognition (Edinburgh Cognitive and Behavioural ALS Screen) and physical functioning (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale-Revised) will also be collated. Caregivers will complete the Brief Dimensional Apathy Scale. After 12 months, a data request to MND-SMART will evaluate recruitment and retention. Descriptive statistics will summarise and compare assessments and participants reaching impairment thresholds. Variable groupings: attitudes, quality of life, cognition, behaviour, physical functioning, neuropsychiatric and phenotype. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression will explore association with participation/withdrawal in MND-SMART; presented as ORs and 95% CIs. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval was provided by the West of Scotland Research Ethics Committee 3 (20/WS/0067) on 12 May 2020. The results of this study will be published in a peer-reviewed journal, presented at academic conferences and disseminated to participants and the public.","Beswick, Emily; Glasmacher, Stella A; Dakin, Rachel; Newton, Judith; Carson, Alan; Abrahams, Sharon; Chandran, Siddharthan; Pal, Suvankar",BMJ Open,,259

The purpose of this study was to describe the cardiac changes in echocardiographic characteristics and vertebral heart size (VHS) in newborn lambs during the neonatal period. Twenty-eight healthy Ile de France lambs were evaluated from birth to 35 days old. With the assistance of echocardiography, this study evaluated, both in systole and diastole, indexes related to the right and left ventricles, the aorta (Ao), the left atrium (LA), the E point to septal separation (EPSS) and the thickness of the interventricular septum (VSd, VSs). The left atrium-to-aorta ratio (LA:Ao) was analyzed and both the shortening (SF%) and ejection fractions were calculated (EF%). The VHS was obtained by measuring the heart's long and short axes and comparing it to the thoracic vertebrae. Throughout the first 35 days, the results obtained demonstrated an increased LV:RV ratio when compared to adult lambs. The calculated indexes and the LA:Ao ratio did not present statistically significant differences. The VHS values were normally distributed, presenting a mean of 9.67 vertebrae (v) during the entire period. Both radiographic and echocardiographic parameters showed significant differences between the analyzed moments. The VHS values ranged from 8.4v at the minimum end to 11.2v at the maximum. In order to prevent these changes from being misdiagnosed as heart diseases, this study contributed to take note of neonatal physiological anatomy peculiarities and in addition, it describes the parameters for this age in Ilê de France lambs.(AU)","Ulian, Carla Maria V; Lourenço, Maria Lucia G; Inamassu, Leticia R; Souza, Priscilla M; Mamprim, Maria Jaqueline; Alfonso, Angélica; Chiacchio, Simone B",Pesqui. vet. bras,,259

Drawing on ideas articulated in the four introductory chapters of the International Handbook of Curriculum Research, edited by William Pinar in 2014, this article discusses Covid-19 and the prospects of education in South Africa. The article shows how understanding the wisdom of indigenous traditions along with the moral dimensions of education, race, and the new technologies of surveillance, neoliberalism, and education can provide a nuanced awareness of the nature of the Covid-19 pandemic. It then explores the implications of such insights for the field of curriculum studies and, where relevant, for the school curriculum.

478054,"Accuracy of the pre-hospital triage tools (qSOFA, NEWS, and PRESEP) in predicting probable COVID-19 patients' outcomes transferred by Emergency Medical Services",2020,"OBJECTIVE: Our study aims to provide a paradigm when it is ethical to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) on patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Hospitals around the nation are enacting systems to limit CPR in caring for COVID+ patients for a variety of legitimate reasons and based on concepts of medical futility and allocation of scarce resources. No ethical framework, however, has been proposed as a standard to guide care in this crucial matter. METHODS: Our analysis begins with definitions of ethically relevant terms. We then cycle an illustrative clinical vignette through the mathematically permissible possibilities to account for all conceivable scenarios. Scenarios with ethical tension are examined. RESULTS: Patients have the negative right to refuse care including CPR, but they do not have the positive right to demand it. Our detailed ethical analysis and recommendations support CPR if and only if 1) CPR is judged medically beneficial, and in line with the patient's and values and goals, 2) allocations or scarce resources follow a just and transparent triage system, and 3) providers are protected from contracting the disease. CONCLUSIONS: CPR is an intervention like any other, with attendant risks and benefits and with responsibility for the utilization of limited resources. Our ethical analysis advocates for a systematic approach to codes that respects the important ethical considerations in caring for the critically ill and facilitates patient-centered, evidence-based, and fair treatment to all.","Kopar, Piroska K; Brown, Douglas E; Turnbull, Isaiah R",Ann Surg,,259
478802,"What is the diagnostic accuracy of chest radiography, ultrasound, and computed tomography for COVID-19?",2021,"The small GTPase Ran has a variety of biological functions, one of the most prominent of which is to regulate nucleocytoplasmic transport. In our previous study, it was suggested that Ran is involved in the deltamethrin (DM) stress. In addition, Keap1-Nrf2-ARE pathway was also confirmed to be associated with DM stress. We report here that under DM stress, interfering Ran or nuclear transport factor Ntf2 by RNAi could suppress the nuclear import of nuclear transcription factor Nrf2 which then down-regulates the expressions of detoxification enzyme genes (Cyp4d20, Cyp4ae1, GstD5, Sod3, etc.), ultimately resulting in a significant apoptosis of Drosophila Kc cells. In contrast, after overexpressing Ran in Kc cells, Nrf2 has a higher concentration in the nucleus, and the expressions of detoxification enzyme genes are up-regulated, while the DM-induced apoptosis is significantly lower than that of the control group. Additionally, we preliminary found silencing Ntf2 or Ran could prevent the nuclear import of transcription factor Dif under DM stress, subsequently decreased expressions of antimicrobial peptide genes (Drsl1). In summary, our data mainly indicates that Ran may participate in DM stress through regulating the nuclear import of Nrf2, which could help to study the mechanism of deltamethrin resistance.

Objective: To confirm the previous finding that high-dose amoxicillin plus clavulanate (with double the amount of amoxicillin) may be superior to standard-dose amoxicillin plus clavulanate in adults. Design, Setting, and Participants: This double-blind, comparative-effectiveness randomized clinical trial was conducted from February 26, 2018, through May 10, 2020, at the academic primary care internal medicine and pediatrics practice of Albany Medical Center, located in Cohoes, New York. Participants included adults aged 18 years or older who were prescribed amoxicillin plus clavulanate for acute bacterial sinusitis diagnosed in accordance with the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines. Interventions: Amoxicillin 875 mg with clavulanate 125 mg plus either placebo (standard dose) or amoxicillin 875 mg (high dose) twice a day for 7 days. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary efficacy outcome was a global rating of ""a lot better"" or ""no symptoms"" at the end of 3 days of treatment using a Global Rating of Improvement scale, with outcomes ranging from 1 (a lot worse) to 6 (no symptoms). The primary adverse effect outcome was severe diarrhea at 3 or 10 days after the start of treatment. Results: At an unplanned interim analysis prompted by COVID-19 restrictions, 157 of a projected 240 participants had been enrolled (mean age, 48.5 [range, 18.7-84.0] years; 117 women [74.5%]), with 79 randomized to the standard dose and 78 to the high dose; 9 and 12, respectively, withdrew or were lost to follow-up before the assessment of the primary outcome. At day 3, 31 of 70 participants (44.3%) in the standard-dose group reported a global rating of ""a lot better"" or ""no symptoms,"" as did 24 of 66 (36.4%) in the high-dose group, for a difference of -7.9% (95% CI, -24.4% to 8.5%; P = .35). The study was, therefore, stopped for futility. Diarrhea was common in both groups by day 3, with any diarrhea reported in 29 of 71 participants (40.8%) receiving the standard dose and 28 of 65 (43.1%) receiving the high dose and severe diarrhea reported in 5 of 71 (7.0%) and 5 of 65 (7.7%), respectively.

While large scale lockdown strategies are effective in reducing the spread rate, they come at a cost of significantly limited societal functions. We show that natural human mobility has high diversity and heterogeneity such that a small group of individuals and gathering venues play an important role in the spread of the disease. We discover that interventions that focus on protecting the most active individuals and most popular venues can significantly reduce the peak infection rate and the total number of infected people while retaining high levels of social activity overall. This trend is observed universally in multi-agent simulations using three mobility data sets of different scales, resolutions, and modalities (check-ins at seven different cities, WiFi connection events at a university, and GPS traces of electric bikes), and suggests that strategies that exploit the network effect in human mobility provide a better balance between disease control and normal social activities.","Wang, Haotian; Ghosh, Abhirup; Ding, Jiaxin; Sarkar, Rik; Gao, Jie",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.06549v1.pdf,259

Objective: To evaluate whether inequities are present in telemedicine use and video visit use for telemedicine visits during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this cohort study, a retrospective medical record review was conducted from March 16 to May 11, 2020, of all patients scheduled for telemedicine visits in primary care and specialty ambulatory clinics at a large academic health system. Age, race/ethnicity, sex, language, median household income, and insurance type were all identified from the electronic medical record. Main Outcomes and Measures: A successfully completed telemedicine visit and video (vs telephone) visit for a telemedicine encounter. Multivariable models were used to assess the association between sociodemographic factors, including sex, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and language, and the use of telemedicine visits, as well as video use specifically. Results: A total of 148â¯402 unique patients (86â¯055 women [58.0%]; mean [SD] age, 56.5 [17.7] years) had scheduled telemedicine visits during the study period; 80â¯780 patients (54.4%) completed visits.

485388,Spontaneous Pneumomediastinum in a Patient with COVID-19 Pneumonia,2021,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a major risk factor for the development of endothelial dysfunction which affects the ability of blood vessels to regulate vascular tone. The study aimed to investigate the mechanisms of vasodilator action of the anaesthetic agents ketamine and propofol in diabetic rat aorta. 30 male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into two equal groups: (i) non-diabetic control (ii) Streptozotocin-induced diabetic group. DM was induced by a single intra-peritoneal injection of streptozotocin at 50 mg/kg body weight. Blood samples were taken from the tail vein after 24 hours and tested for glucose level using an automated glucose analyser. A blood glucose &#8805;10 mmol/L confirmed hyperglycaemia and the development of DM. Rats were sacrificed, and the aortae excised. The vascular responses of aortic rings from both groups to ketamine, propofol in the presence of vasoactive agents were studied using standard organ bath procedures. Ketamine and propofol reduced Phe-induced contraction similarly in the diabetic and control groups. Barium chloride, attenuated the relaxation response to propofol in diabetic aorta when compared to ketamine. 4-aminopyridine significantly attenuated the relaxation response to ketamine and propofol in diabetic aorta. Glibenclamide, significantly reduced ketamine-induced relaxation in diabetic aorta when compared to propofol. Activation of K+ channels with nicorandil or NS1619 did not affect the relaxation response to ketamine or propofol in diabetic aorta. The results recommend that propofol can be effective in mitigating the consequences of hemodynamic instability in glibenclamide treated diabetics when compared to ketamine. This response is mediated by propofol-induced inhibition of intracellular calcium influx.","Facey, Joan; Young, Lauriann; Nwokocha, Chukwuemeka",Niger J Physiol Sci,,259

We show that the resulting SEIR behavior-perception model has three principal modes of qualitative behavior-no outbreak, controlled outbreak, and uncontrolled outbreak. We also demonstrate that the model can produce transient and sustained waves of infection consistent with secondary outbreaks. We fit the model to cumulative COVID-19 case and mortality data from several regions. Our analysis suggests that regions which experience a significant decline after the first wave of infection, such as Canada and Israel, are more likely to contain secondary waves of infection, whereas regions which only achieve moderate success in mitigating the disease's spread initially, such as the United States, are likely to experience substantial secondary waves or uncontrolled outbreaks.","Johnston, Matthew D; Pell, Bruce",Math Biosci Eng,,259

The rapid worldwide spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection has necessitated a global effort to identify effective therapeutic strategies in the absence of vaccine. Among the re-purposed drugs being tested currently, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), without or with zinc ion (Zn++) and the antibiotic azithromycin (AZM), has been administered to prevent or treat patients with COVID-19. The outcome of multiple clinical studies on HCQ has been mixed. Zn++ interferes with viral replication by inhibiting replicative enzymes and its entry into cells may be facilitated by HCQ. Another immunomodulatory drug, methotrexate (MTX), is well known for its ability to mitigate overactive immune system by upregulating the anti-inflammatory protein, A20. However, its beneficial effect in treating COVID-19 has not drawn much attention. This review provides an overview of the virology of SARS-CoV-2 and an analysis of the mechanisms by which these anti-inflammatory agents may act in the treatment of COVID-19 patients. We propose a rationale for the combinatorial use of these re-purposed drugs that may help to combat this ongoing pandemic health emergency.","Rajaiah, Rajesh; Abhilasha, Kandahalli V; Shekar, Mysore A; Vogel, Stefanie N; Vishwanath, Bannikuppe S",Cell Immunol,,259

Positive selection analysis and secondary structure investigation of spike sequences was performed. Adaptive molecular evolution was observed in SARS-CoV-2 displayed by positive selection pressure at N-terminal domain (NTD; codons 41, 163, 174 and 218), Receptor binding domain (RBD; codons 378 and 404) and S1/S2 Cleavage site (codon 690). Furthermore, the spike protein secondary structure depicted by the homo-trimer structure showed a high similarity between Saudi SARS-CoV-2 isolate and the parental strain (bat SL-COVZC45). Despite the high similarity depicted in the spike sequence model alignment, it displayed a significant difference when each chain was treated solely owing to 7 motif differences in the three composing chains. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 S trimer model uncovered the presence of N-acetyl glucosamine ligands. Eventually, 3C-like proteinase cleavage site was observed in S2 domain could be used as a site for drug discovery. Genetics and molecular evolutionary facts are useful for assessment of evolution, host adaptation and epidemic patterns ultimately helpful for adaptation of control strategies.","Nour, Islam; Alanazi, Ibrahim O; Hanif, Atif; Eifan, Saleh",,,259

493692,New insights into the association between body-mass index and severe COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: During coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic, reducing the number of invasive procedure and choosing conservative medication strategy for patients with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) is unavoidable. Whether this relatively conservative strategy will impact in-hospital outcome for NSTEMI patients remains unclear. METHODS AND RESULTS: The current study included all consecutive NSTEMI patients who visited the emergency department in Fuwai Hospital from February 1 to March 31, 2020 and all the NSTEMI patients in the same period of 2019 as a historical control. Very-high-risk patients were defined as clinical presentation of heart failure, cardiac shock, cardiac arrest, recurrent chest pain, and life-threatening arrhythmias. The primary outcome was in-hospital major adverse cardiac events (MACE), defined as a composite of all-cause death, recurrent myocardial infarction, or heart failure. A total of 115 NSTEMI patients were enrolled since the outbreak of COVID-19, and a total of 145 patients were included in the control group. There was a tendency toward higher MACE risk in 2020 compared with 2019 (18.3% vs. 11.7%, p = .14). Among very-high-risk patients, early percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) strategy in 2019 was associated with reduced MACE risk compared with delayed PCI in 2020 (60.6% [20/33] in 2020 vs. 27.9% [12/43] in 2019, p = .01). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 pandemic results in a significant reduction in immediate/early PCI and a trend toward higher adverse event rate during hospitalization, particular in very-high-risk patients.","Liu, Shuai; Song, Chenxi; Yin, Dong; Wang, Yang; Zhao, Yanyan; Yang, Weixian; Qiao, Shubin; Dou, Kefei; Xu, Bo",Catheter. cardiovasc. interv,,259
493946,Patient characteristics associated with COVID-19 positivity and fatality in Nigeria: retrospective cohort study,2020,"BACKGROUND: The cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 disease are poorly characterized. OBJECTIVES: To describe the cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 disease and to relate them to other clinical findings. METHODS: We carried out a nationwide case collection survey of images and clinical data. Using a consensus we described five clinical patterns. We later described the association of these patterns with patient demographics, the timing in relation to symptoms of the disease, the severity and the prognosis. RESULTS: The lesions may be classified as acral areas of erythema with vesicles or pustules (pseudo-chilblain) (19%), other vesicular eruptions (9%), urticarial lesions (19%), maculopapular eruptions (47%) and livedo or necrosis (6%). Vesicular eruptions appear early in the course of the disease (15% before other symptoms). The pseudo-chilblain pattern frequently appears late in the evolution of the COVID-19 disease (59% after other symptoms), while the rest tend to appear with other symptoms of COVID-19. The severity of COVID-19 shows a gradient from less severe disease in acral lesions to more severe in the latter groups. The results are similar for confirmed and suspected cases, in terms of both clinical and epidemiological findings. Alternative diagnoses are discussed but seem unlikely for the most specific patterns (pseudo-chilblain and vesicular). CONCLUSIONS: We provide a description of the cutaneous manifestations associated with COVID-19 infection. These may help clinicians approach patients with the disease and recognize cases presenting with few symptoms. What is already known about this topic? Previous descriptions of cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 were case reports and mostly lacked illustrations. What does this study add? We describe a large, representative sample of patients with unexplained skin manifestations and a diagnosis of COVID-19, using a consensus method to define morphological patterns associated with COVID-19. We describe five clinical patterns associated with different patient demographics, timing and prognosis, and provide illustrations of these patterns to allow for easy recognition.","Galván Casas, C; Català, A; Carretero Hernández, G; Rodríguez-Jiménez, P; Fernández-Nieto, D; Rodríguez-Villa Lario, A; Navarro Fernández, I; Ruiz-Villaverde, R; Falkenhain-López, D; Llamas Velasco, M; García-Gavín, J; Baniandrés, O; González-Cruz, C; Morillas-Lahuerta, V; Cubiró, X; Figueras Nart, I; Selda-Enriquez, G; Romaní, J; Fustà-Novell, X; Melian-Olivera, A; Roncero Riesco, M; Burgos-Blasco, P; Sola Ortigosa, J; Feito Rodriguez, M; García-Doval, I",Br J Dermatol,,259

Individuals with comorbidities were included. Exclusion criteria included a current smoking habit.Design A cross-sectional study involving a videoscope-guided autopsy to obtain a periodontal tissue sample. The plastic body wrapping was incised in the facial region, allowing the insertion of a video endoscope. A single sample of periodontal tissue (junctional epithelium, adjacent oral epithelium and underlying connective tissue) was obtained from the mesial interproximal papilla of the maxillary first molar (or if absent, the mesial tooth). The sample was cleaned using an enzymatic detergent (Riozyme) to mimic the effects of salivary flow and was collected using blunt dissection. The sample was divided into two samples for either histopathological analysis (haematoxylin and eosin stain) or molecular analysis. Real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) was used to test for the presence of the envelope (E) gene of SARS-CoV-2. Data on comorbidities, smoking status, period of hospitalisation and time from onset of symptoms to death were also collected.Data analysis Descriptive analysis was performed and results were presented as a cross tabulation. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 in samples was presented as the rRT-PCR cycle threshold value and the histopathological analysis results were Boolean (that is, presence/absence of vacuolisation or nuclear pleomorphism).Results A total of seven individuals were examined: four women and three men. The age range was 8-74 years and the range of periods between onset of symptoms and death was 10-31 days. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in five samples, with a mean cycle threshold of 31.38 (range 27.28-36.55). Nuclear pleomorphism and vacuolisation were found in two and three cases, respectively.Conclusions SARS-CoV-2 genetic material was present in most periodontal tissue samples of individuals with COVID-19. The sample size, however, was small and only included severely ill individuals with prolonged periods of hospitalisation. Consequently, the applicability of the findings to the general population is limited.","Adam, Mohammed",Evid Based Dent,,259

Our objective was to assess patient satisfaction with telemedicine during the COVID-19 era. Methods: Telemedicine visit data were gathered from Stanford Health Care (Stanford) and the Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS). Patient satisfaction data from HSS were captured from a Press-Ganey questionnaire between April 19, 2020, and December 12, 2020, whereas Stanford data were taken from a novel survey instrument that was distributed to all patients between June 22, 2020, and November 1, 2020. Participants: There were 60,550 telemedicine visits at Stanford, each linked with a postvisit survey. At HSS, there were 66,349 total telemedicine visits with 7,348 randomly linked with a postvisit survey. Main Outcomes and Measures: Two measures of patient satisfaction were used for this study: (1) a patient's ""overall visit score"" and (2) whether the patient indicated the highest possible ""likelihood to recommend"" (LTR) score (LTR top box score). Results: The LTR top box percentage at Stanford increased from 69.6% to 74.0% (p = 0.0002), and HSS showed no significant change (p = 0.7067). In the multivariable model, the use of a cell phone (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 1.18; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.12-1.23) and tablet (aOR: 1.15; 95% CI: 1.07-1.23) was associated with higher overall scores, whereas visits with interrupted connections (aOR: 0.49; 95% CI: 0.42-0.57) or help required to connect (aOR: 0.49; 95% CI: 0.42-0.56) predicted lower patient satisfaction. Conclusions: We present the largest published description of patient satisfaction with telemedicine, and we identify important telemedicine-specific factors that predict increased overall visit score. These include the use of cell phones or tablets, phone reminders, and connecting before the visit was scheduled to begin. Visits with poor connectivity, extended wait times, or difficulty being seen, examined, or understood by the provider were linked with reduced odds of high scores. Our results suggest that attention to connectivity and audio/visual definition will help optimize patient satisfaction with future telemedicine encounters.","Rodrigues, Adrian; Yu, Jonathan S; Bhambhvani, Hriday; Uppstrom, Tyler; Ricci, William M; Dines, Joshua S; Hayden-Gephart, Melanie",Telemed. j. e. health,,259
497184,The Role of Incentive Spirometry for Patients with COVID-19,2021,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to an unprecedented demand for testing - for diagnosis and prognosis - as well as for investigation into the impact of the disease on the host metabolism. Sebum sampling has the potential to support both needs by looking at what the virus does to us, rather than looking for the virus itself. Methods: In this pilot study, sebum samples were collected from 67 hospitalised patients (30 COVID-19 positive and 37 COVID-19 negative) by gauze swab. Lipidomics analysis was carried out using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry, identifying 998 reproducible features. Univariate and multivariate statistical analyses were applied to the resulting feature set. Findings: Lipid levels were depressed in COVID-19 positive participants, indicative of dyslipidemia; p-values of 0·022 and 0·015 were obtained for triglycerides and ceramides respectively, with effect sizes of 0·44 and 0·57. Partial Least Squares-Discriminant Analysis showed separation of COVID-19 positive and negative participants with sensitivity of 57% and specificity of 68%, improving to 79% and 83% respectively when controlled for confounding comorbidities. Interpretation: COVID-19 dysregulates many areas of metabolism; in this work we show that the skin lipidome can be added to the list. Given that samples can be provided quickly and painlessly, we conclude that sebum is worthy of future consideration for clinical sampling.

This paper aims to investigate the impact of the confined measures due to COVID-19 outbreak on energy demand of a building mix in a district. Three levels of confinement for occupant schedules are proposed based on a new district design in Sweden. The Urban Modeling Interface tool is applied to simulate the energy performance of the building mix. The boundary conditions and input parameters are set up according to the Swedish building standards and statistics. The district is at early-design stage, which includes a mix of building functions, i.e. residential buildings, offices, schools and retail shops. By comparing with the base case (normal life without confinement measures), the average delivered electricity demand of the entire district increases in a range of 14.3% to 18.7% under the three confinement scenarios. However, the mean system energy demands (sum of heating, cooling, and domestic hot water) decreases in a range of 7.1% to 12.0%. These two variation nearly cancel each other out, leaving the total energy demand almost unaffected. The result also shows that the delivered electricity demands in all cases have a relatively smooth variation across a year, while the system energy demands follow the principle trends for all the cases, which have peak demands in winter and much lower demands in transit seasons and summer.

The impact of this virus on our health, relationships, and careers is difficult to overstate. As the economic realities for academic medical centers come into focus, we must recommit to our core missions of patient care, education, and research. Fellowship education programs in gynecologic oncology have quickly adapted to the ""new normal"" of social distancing using video conferencing platforms to continue clinical and didactic teaching. United in a time of crisis, we have embraced systemic change by developing and delivering collaborative educational content, overcoming the limitations imposed by institutional silos. Additional innovations are needed in order to overcome the losses in program surgical volume and research opportunities. With the end of the viral pandemic nowhere in sight, program directors can rethink how education is best delivered and potentially overhaul aspects of fellowship curriculum and content. Similarly, restrictions on travel and the need for social distancing has transformed the 2020 fellowship interview season from an in-person to a virtual experience. During this time of unprecedented and rapid change, program directors should be particularly mindful of the needs and health of their trainees and consider tailoring their educational experiences accordingly.","Ferriss, J Stuart; Rose, Steve; Rungruang, Bunja; Urban, Renata; Spencer, Ryan; Uppal, Shitanshu; Sinno, Abdulrahman K; Duska, Linda; Walsh, Christine",Gynecol. oncol,,259

504891,Very severe COVID-19 in the critically ill in Tunisia,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic is a public health emergency that demands leadership throughout the health care system. Leadership is the ability to guide a team or organization toward a stated goal or objective. In addition to hospital-wide leadership, there is need for leadership at the level of medical teams. Resident leadership is essential to ensure team function and patient care, yet residents are often overlooked as valuable leaders. This Perspective argues that residents can demonstrate leadership during a public health crisis by creating a culture of emotional intelligence in their medical teams. Emotional intelligence has been identified as a critical aspect of leadership and consists of self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, and relationship management. In psychiatry, patient interactions depend upon psychiatrists demonstrating a high level of attention to their own thoughts, feelings, and behaviors as well as those of the patient to communicate in a way that demonstrates both understanding and empathy. In this Perspective, a psychiatry resident uses expertise in emotional intelligence to recommend residents (1) be mindful, (2) ask and listen, (3) establish safety, and (4) unite around a common goal. These practical recommendations can be immediately implemented to increase emotional intelligence on medical teams to improve team function and patient care. Emotional intelligence is valuable at all levels of leadership, so hospital leadership and program directors should also heed these suggestions. While these recommendations are not unique to COVID-19, they are of paramount importance during the pandemic.","Ward, Heather Burrell",Acad Med,,259

Since then, the cases increased significantly, but information on the public's psychological status and specifically individuals with physical disabilities is still limited. PURPOSE: The study aims to assess the psychological impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on Lebanese individuals with physical disabilities and study the associated factors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study involving 118 individuals with physical disabilities. Each filled out an online survey with three sections: a personal questionnaire, the Arabic versions of the Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25 and the Fear of COVID-19 scale. Data regarding participants' baseline characteristics, fear, anxiety, and depression were collected and analyzed using the Chi-square test and regressions models. RESULTS: Individuals with physical disabilities exhibited mild fear of COVID-19, with fear being correlated with age, educational level, and employment status. Furthermore, 22.9% of the population was found to be anxious, and 31.5% were depressed. Anxiety was associated with both marital status and employment status. Finally, depression was proved to be influenced by marital status, employment, and educational level. CONCLUSION: Results extracted showed that individuals with physical disabilities require substantial attention in order to manage their psychological state during pandemics.","Summaka, Marwa; Zein, Hiba; Naim, Ibrahim; Fneish, Sleiman",Disabil Health J,,259
512237,Obesity and risk of COVID-19: analysis of UK biobank,2020,"The COVID-19 epidemic has crashed on the social and economic stability of China and even the world, and raised the question: how has the Chinese government done with public health in recent years? The purpose of this paper is to clarify the definition and items of Chinese public-health expenditure, then to objectively evaluate the Chinese government's performance, so as to help the government to perform better in public health. To achieve this goal, we measure the Chinese public-health expenditure at national and provincial levels based on our definition, and then compare it with the expenditures of other countries. The results show that: (1) the level of public-health expenditure in China is relatively low and far lower than that in developed countries; (2) Chinese governments have not paid enough attention to the prevention and control of major public-health emergencies, which may be an important reason for the outbreak of COVID-19; (3) Chinese public-health expenditure shows a fluctuating growth trend, but the growth rate is so slow that it is lower than that of GDP and fiscal expenditure; (4) although the Chinese government inclines the public-health expenditure to the poor provinces in central and western regions, the imbalance and inequity of public-health resource allocation are still expanding among provinces; (5) there is a lot of waste of resources in the public-health system, which seriously reduces the efficiency of public-health expenditure in China. Therefore, the Chinese government should improve the quantity and quality of public-health expenditure in the above aspects.","Jin, Hui; Qian, Xinyi",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,259

Methods: The literature concerning medial support augmentation of plate osteosynthesis for proximal humeral fractures in recent years was extensively reviewed, as well as the biomechanical benefit and clinical advantage were analyzed thoroughly. Results: Medial support augmentation of plate osteosynthesis for proximal humeral fractures is very important, especially in osteoporotic and/or comminuted fractures. Many medial support augmentation methods have been proposed which can be divided into extramedullary support and intramedullary support. It can also be divided into autogenous bone support and allogenic bone support according to the material and source, divided into medial column support, calcar support, and humeral head support according to the support site, and divided into fibular shaft support, femoral head support, anatomic fibula support according to the shape of the augmented fixation. At present, clinical and biomechanical researches show that medial support augmentation is an effective treatment for proximal humeral fractures. Conclusion: As an important treatment strategy for the treatment of proximal humeral fractures, the medial support augmentation of plate osteosynthesis gets the focus from the biomechanical studies and clinical treatment. However, there are still widespread controversies among orthopedic surgeons regarding the support mode, site, implant shape, and material of medial column support for augmentation of proximal humeral fractures. More high-quality clinical trials and biomechanical researches as well as multi-disciplinary integration, are needed to provide better strategy treatment for the treatment of proximal humeral fractures.","Chang, Zuhao; Zhang, Wei; Tang, Peifu; Chen, Hua",Zhongguo Xiu Fu Chong Jian Wai Ke Za Zhi,,259

Our objective was to establish a predictive model of disease progression to facilitate early decision-making. A retrospective study was performed of patients admitted with COVID-19 pneumonia, classified as severe (admission to the intensive care unit, mechanic invasive ventilation, or death) or non-severe. A predictive model based on clinical, laboratory, and radiological parameters was built. The probability of progression to severe disease was estimated by logistic regression analysis. Calibration and discrimination (receiver operating characteristics curves and AUC) were assessed to determine model performance. During the study period 1152 patients presented with SARS-CoV-2 infection, of whom 229 (19.9%) were admitted for pneumonia. During hospitalization, 51 (22.3%) progressed to severe disease, of whom 26 required ICU care (11.4); 17 (7.4%) underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 32 (14%) died of any cause. Five predictors determined within 24 h of admission were identified: Diabetes, Age, Lymphocyte count, SaO2, and pH (DALSH score).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed glucose reading obtained by FGM or CGM in T1D subjects. Sensor data from 2 weeks before the lockdown (Period 0, P0), 2 weeks immediately after the lockdown (period 1, P1), in mid-lockdown (Period 2, P2) and immediately after end of lockdown (Period 3, P3) were analyzed. RESULTS: The study included 63 T1D patients, (FGM: 52, 82%; CGM:11, 18%). Sensor use (91%) were slightly reduced. Despite this reduction, Time in Range increased in P1 (62%), P2 (61%) and P3 (62%) as compared to P0 (58%, all p < 0.05 or less) with concomitant reduction in the Time Above Range (P0: 38%; P1: 34%, P2: 34%, P3: 32%, all p < 0.05 or less vs. P0).

Performance of fifteen different lateral flow POCTs for the detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies was performed on a well characterized set of 100 samples. Of these, 40 samples from known SARS-CoV-2-infected, convalescent individuals (average of 45 days post symptom onset) were used to assess sensitivity. Sixty samples from the pre-pandemic era (negative control), that were known to have been infected with other respiratory viruses (rhinoviruses A, B, C and/or coronavirus 229E, HKU1, NL63 OC43) were used to assess specificity. The timing of seroconversion was assessed on five LFAs on a panel of 272 longitudinal samples from 47 patients of known time since symptom onset.Results. For the assays that were evaluated, the sensitivity and specificity for any reactive band ranged from 55%-97% and 78%-100%, respectively. When assessing the performance of the IgM and the IgG bands alone, sensitivity and specificity ranged from 0%-88% and 80%-100% for IgM and 25%-95% and 90%-100% for IgG. Longitudinal testing revealed that median time post symptom onset to a positive result was 7 days (IQR 5.4, 9.8) for IgM and 8.2 days (IQR 6.3 to 11.3) for IgG.Conclusion. The testing performance varied widely among LFAs with most variation related to the sensitivity of the assays. The IgM band was most likely to misclassify pre-pandemic samples.

519443,Aging versus youth: Endocrine aspects of vulnerability for COVID-19,2021,"Secure and scalable device provisioning is a notorious challenge in Wi-Fi. WPA2/WPA3 solutions take user interaction and a strong passphrase for granted. However, the often weak passphrases are subject to guessing attacks. Notably, there has been a significant rise of cyberattacks on Wi-Fi home or small office networks during the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper addresses the device provisioning problem in Wi-Fi (personal mode) and proposes ComPass protocol to supplement WPA2/WPA3. ComPass replaces the pre-installed or user-selected passphrases with automatically generated ones. For this, ComPass employs Physical Layer Security and extracts credentials from common random physical layer parameters between devices. Two major features make ComPass unique and superior compared to previous proposals: First, it employs phase information (rather than amplitude or signal strength) to generate the passphrase so that it is robust, scaleable, and impossible to guess. Our analysis showed that ComPass generated passphrases have 3 times more entropy than human generated passphrases (113-bits vs. 34-bits). Second, ComPass selects parameters such that two devices bind only within a certain proximity (less than 3m), hence providing practically useful in-build PLS-based authentiation. ComPass is available as a kernel module or as full firmware.","Reaz, Khan; Wunder, Gerhard",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.06763v1.pdf,259

METHOD: We reviewed hospital records of children (<18 years) admitted from 1 April to 31 May, 2020 at a tertiary-care public hospital and identified those positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus (SARS-CoV-2) by RT-PCR of respiratory secretions. RESULTS: 81.2% of the 85 children studied were asymptomatic and 3 (8.5%) died. Severe lymphopenia (43.8%), raised C-reactive protein (93.8%), raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate (75%) and high (>500ng/mL) levels of D-dimer (37.5%) were common. Median (IQR) duration of viral shedding was 7 (5-10) days, with range of 2 to 45 days; 96.3% had viral clearance within 14 days. CONCLUSIONS: Majority of children aged <18 years with SARS-CoV-2 infection had viral clearance within 14 days.","Gupta, Manohar Lal; Gothwal, Sunil; Gupta, Raj Kumar; Sharma, Ram Babu; Meena, Jeetam Singh; Sulaniya, Pawan Kumar; Dev, Deveshwar; Gupta, Deepak Kumar",Indian pediatr,,259

521943,Indications and timing for tracheostomy in patients with SARS CoV2-related,2020,"Introduction: Recently, researchers from China and France reported on the effectiveness of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine for the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 viral replication in vitro. Timely dissemination of scientific information is key in times of pandemic. A systematic review of the effect and safety of these drugs on COVID-19 is urgently needed. Objective: To map published studies until March 25, 2020, on the use of chloroquine and its derivates in patients with COVID-19. Materials and methods: We searched on PubMed, Embase, Lilacs, and 15 registries from the World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for theoretical and empirical research in English, Spanish, Italian, French, or Portuguese until March 25, 2020, and made a narrative synthesis of the results. Results: We included 19 records and 24 trial registries (n=43) including 18,059 patients. China registered 66% (16/24) of the trials. Nine trials evaluate chloroquine exclusively and eight hydroxychloroquine. The records are comments (n=9), in vitro studies (n=3), narrative reviews (n=2), clinical guidelines (n=2), as well as a systematic review, an expert consensus, and a clinical trial. Conclusions: One small (n=26), non-randomized, and flawed clinical trial supports hydroxychloroquine use in patients with COVID-19. There is an urgent need for more clinical trial results to determine the effect and safety of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine on COVID-19.","Pimentel, Juan; Andersson, Neil",Biomedica,,259

We report a monoclonal antibody (FVM04) that targets a uniquely exposed epitope within the RBS, cross-neutralizes Ebola (EBOV), Sudan (SUDV), and to a lesser extent Bundibugyo viruses, and shows protection against EBOV and SUDV in mice and guinea pigs. The antibody cocktail ZMapp™, is remarkably effective against EBOV (Zaire), but does not cross-neutralize other ebolaviruses. By replacing one of the ZMapp™ components with FVM04, we retained the anti-EBOV efficacy while extending the breadth of protection to SUDV, thereby generating a cross protective antibody cocktail. In addition, we report several mutations at the base of the ebolavirus glycoprotein that enhance the binding of FVM04 and other cross-reactive antibodies. These findings have important implications for pan-ebolavirus vaccine development and defining broadly protective antibody cocktails.","Howell, Katie A.; Qiu, Xiangguo; Brannan, Jennifer M.; Bryan, Christopher; Davidson, Edgar; Holtsberg, Frederick W.; Wec, Anna Z.; Shulenin, Sergey; Biggins, Julia E.; Douglas, Robin; Enterlein, Sven G.; Turner, Hannah L.; Pallesen, Jesper; Murin, Charles D.; He, Shihua; Kroeker, Andrea; Vu, Hong; Herbert, Andrew S.; Fusco, Marnie L.; Nyakatura, Elisabeth K.; Lai, Jonathan R.; Keck, Zhen-Yong; Foung, Steven K.

The oral cavity is in close anatomical proximity to the upper respiratory tract, and it is conceivable that the viruses could pass through the oral cavity and infect to the upper respiratory tract. Several researchers have suggested that colonization of certain pathogenic bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pneumoniae might affect the risk of influenza viral disease, indicating that oral hygiene and/or condition might play an important role in respiratory viral infection. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate whether an oral hygiene/condition might impact influenza infection. We conducted a retrospective observational study of Japanese citizens’ regional cohort (N = 2,904) consisting of National Health Insurance beneficiaries who underwent annual health/dental examination with data entries in the Kokuho database (KDB). Trained dentists checked the oral hygiene/condition, and saliva specimens were examined using the LION dental saliva multi-test (SMT) kit. Influenza infection was identified from the diagnosis recorded in the KDB. The correlations between influenza infection and oral hygiene, dryness of the mouth, or various salivary test results were examined by a multivariate analysis adjusting for confounding factors such as gender, age, recent smoking, alcohol drinking, BMI, HbA1c, RBC for influenza infection. The logistic regression model showed that age significantly correlated with influenza infection. In addition, oral hygiene status had a nearly significant impact on influenza infection (p = 0.061), whereby, the subjects with poor oral hygiene had a higher risk of influenza infection than those with good oral hygiene (odds ratio: 1.63, 95% confidence interval: 0.89–2.95). Further, the prevalence of influenza infection was lower in the subjects with saliva weakly acidic and/or containing higher protein level. The results of this study suggested that the maintenance of oral health conditions might be one of the pivotal factors for preventing and reducing influenza infection.","Kawamoto, Makiko; Tanaka, Hirokazu; Sakurai, Akinari; Otagiri, Hiroki; Karasawa, Imahito; Yamada, Shin-ichi; Kurita, Hiroshi",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0254981; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34407097/,259

Reusable elastomeric respirators are suitable alternatives when used with compatible filters. These filters may be difficult to source and elastomeric respirators are not recommended for surgical use as the exhaled air is not filtered. Breathing system filters are routinely used in anaesthetic circuits to filter virus and bacteria. In this study, we designed 3D printed adapters that allowed elastomeric respirators to utilise breathing system filters and made simple modifications to the respirators to filter exhaled breaths. We then evaluated the performance and safety of our modified elastomeric respirators with quantitative fit tests. We recruited 8 volunteers to perform quantitative fit tests. Fit factors, respiratory rate and end-tidal carbon dioxide were recorded before and after wearing the modified respirators for 1 hour. All 8 volunteers obtained fit factors of 200+, the maximum achievable, for all tests exercises in all fit tests. The mean (range) end-tidal carbon dioxide was 4.5 (3.9-5.5) kPa and 4.6 (range 4.1-5.3) kPa before and after 1 hour of usage. The mean (range) respiratory rate was 16.5 (11-24) min-1 and 17.4 (15-22) min-1 before and after 1 hour of usage. Four (50%) did not experience any subjective discomfort while 2 (25%) reported pressure on the face, 1 (12.5%) reported exhalation resistance and 1 (12.5%) reported transient dizziness with exertion. Breathing system filters combined with properly fitted reusable elastomeric respirators is a safe alternative to N95 during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Liu, D. C. Y.; Koo, T. H.; Wong, J. K.

This paper contributes to a better understanding of the “texture and nature” of SD initiatives in emerging economies through the eyes of relevant actors involved or reflecting about them in Colombia. The aim of this paper is to propose a general governance scheme for SD in emerging economies and its potential instrumentation for a policy-mix. In Colombia, SD initiatives are very fragmented, and are not part of the priorities of the Colombian state, however the increasing interest of an embryonic practitioner and scholar community working in the topic make necessary this work. A phenomenological perspective combined with a single case study research methodology is used to gain a very accurate description of the state of the situation of SD in Colombia. Policy document review and semi-structured interviews were conducted with 18 relevant actors to understand the conceptions, practices, and suggestions for the future of SD in Colombia. The study results show that SD actors in Colombia are scattered, practices strongly related to traditional cooperation diplomatic activities and the need to give a function to SD for capacity building, better global intermediation and the development of new knowledge, in particular promoting SD abilities in the scientific community. In addition, data expresses the need to cultivate a multi-stakeholder working group for such a purpose. The study reflects on the need of a policy mix for SD in emerging economies. It proposes a general governance scheme for it, a potential instrumentation founded on research participant future suggestions, and a set of practical recommendations and policy implications. Conclusions and further research questions are set, pointing out the importance of including non-conventional diplomacy actors and knowledge, and the need to inquire rationales behind possible SD policy mixes in the southern world.","Echeverría King, Luisa Fernanda; González, Diana Alejandra; Andrade-Sastoque, Ernesto",Front Res Metr Anal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33997599/; https://doi.org/10.3389/frma.2021.636538,259

This paper describes a custom built sparse space–time autoregressive (SSTAR) model to infer and forecast contemporaneous and future dengue transmission patterns in Singapore and 16 administrative regions within Malaysia, taking into account connectivity and geographical adjacency between regions as well as climatic factors. A modification to forecast impulse responses is developed for the case of the SSTAR and is used to simulate changes in dengue transmission in neighbouring regions following a disturbance. The results indicate that there are long-term responses of the neighbouring regions to shocks in a region. By computation of variable inclusion probabilities, we found that each region’s own past counts were important to describe contemporaneous case counts. In 15 out of 16 regions, other regions case counts were important to describe contemporaneous case counts even after controlling for past local dengue transmissions and exogenous factors. Leave-one-region-out analysis using SSTAR showed that dengue transmission counts could be reconstructed for 13 of 16 regions' counts using external dengue transmissions compared to a climate only approach. Lastly, one to four week ahead forecasts from the SSTAR were more accurate than baseline univariate autoregressions.","Jue Tao, Lim; Dickens, Borame Sue Lee; Yinan, Mao; Woon Kwak, Chae; Ching, Ng Lee; Cook, Alex R.",J R Soc Interface,https://doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2020.0340; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32693746/,259

We performed a prospective study to evaluate the value of plasma copy number variation (CNV) assays in diagnosing BTC. METHODS: 47 treatment-naïve patients with suspicious biliary lesions were recruited. Plasma samples were collected at admission. Cell-free DNA was analyzed by low coverage whole genome sequencing, followed by CNV analyses via a customized bioinformatics workflow, namely the ultrasensitive chromosomal aneuploidy detector. RESULTS: 29 patients were pathologically diagnosed as BTC, including 8 gallbladder cancers (GBCs) and 21 cholangiocarcinomas (CCs). Cancer patients had more CNV signals as compared with benign patients (26/29 vs. 2/18, P < 0.001). The most frequent copy number gains were chr3q (7/29) and chr8q (6/29). The most frequent copy number losses were chr7p (6/29), chr17p (6/29), and chr19p (6/29). The sensitivity and specificity of plasma CNV assays in diagnosing BTC were 89.7% and 88.9%, respectively. For CA 19-9 (cutoff: 37 U/ml), the sensitivity was 58.6% and the specificity was 72.2%. The diagnostic accuracy of CNV assays significantly outperformed CA 19-9 (AUC 0.91 vs. 0.62, P = 0.004). Compared with CA 19-9 alone, the adding of CNV profiles to CA 19-9 increased the sensitivity in diagnosing GBC (75.0% vs. 25.0%) and CC (100% vs. 52.4%). Higher CNV burden was also associated with decreased overall survival (Hazard ratio = 4.32, 95% CI 2.06–9.08, P = 0.033). DISCUSSION: Our results suggest that BTC harbors rich plasma CNV signals, and their assays might be useful for diagnosing BTC.","Wang, Xiang; Fu, Xiao-Hui; Qian, Zi-Liang; Zhao, Teng; Duan, An-Qi; Ruan, Xiang; Zhu, Bin; Yin, Lei; Zhang, Yong-Jie; Yu, Wen-Long",Transl Oncol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1936523320304009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33059123/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tranon.2020.100908; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1936523320304009,259

The aim of this survey was to investigate ambulance staff awareness of vitamin D, and the risks associated with deficiency, to inform the need for appropriate well-being resources. Methods: A purpose-designed, 20-question survey was developed, based on a validated vitamin D questionnaire, to explore staff vitamin D knowledge and self-health in one UK ambulance service. Disseminated during June/July 2020, survey completion was voluntary, and responses obtained were analysed using descriptive and thematic approaches. Results: A total of 384 survey responses were received;41% (n = 156) of respondents were male. Over half worked within emergency operational service delivery (57%;n = 219). Respondents were predominantly 'White British' (92%;n = 352). According to the Fitzpatrick Scale, most described themselves as having a 'Medium, between white to moderate brown: sometimes mild burns, gradual tan' complexion (47%;n = 182). The majority felt they got sufficient sunlight exposure when at home (66%;n = 253), but not at work (58%;n = 222). Almost one fifth (17%;n = 66) had received a diagnosis of vitamin D deficiency. Forty percent took vitamin D supplements: 12% (n = 45) as advised by a medical professional;28% (n = 107) self-directed to prevent deficiency. The ability of respondents to recognise known factors that affect vitamin D production in the skin, good vitamin D food sources and individuals at risk of vitamin D deficiency were variable. Respondents commented on their lack of vitamin D awareness, vitamin supplementation, COVID-19, work arrangements and access to sunlight. Conclusions: Ambulance staff are at risk of vitamin D deficiency irrespective of their role: vitamin D awareness, access to sunlight and use of vitamin D supplements are variable. For affected individuals, the impact of vitamin D deficiency can be significant, requiring absence from work. The development of appropriate vitamin D and well-being resources appears to be warranted.","Prothero, L.

SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped spherical-shaped virus. The ribonucleic acid (RNA) is oriented in a 5’-3’direction which makes it a positive sense RNA virus, and the RNA can be read directly as a messenger RNA. The nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14) has proofreading activity which allows the rate of mutations to stay low. A change in the genetic sequence is called a mutation. Genomes that differ from each other in genetic sequence are called variants. Variants are the result of mutations but differ from each other by one or more mutations. When a phenotypic difference is demonstrated among the variants, they are called strains. Viruses constantly change in two different ways, antigenic drift and antigenic shift. SARS-CoV-2 genome is also prone to various mutations that led to antigenic drift resulting in escape from immune recognition. The Center of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) updates the variant strains in the different classes. The classes are variant of interest, variant of concern and variant of high consequence. The current variants included in the variant of interest by the USA are: B.1.526, B.1.525, and P.2; and those included in the variant of concern by the USA are B.1.1.7, P.1, B.1.351, B.1.427, and B.1.429. The double and triple mutant variants first reported in India have resulted in a massive increase in the number of cases. Emerging variants not only result in increased transmissibility, morbidity and mortality, but also have the ability to evade detection by existing or currently available diagnostic tests, which can potentially delay the diagnosis and treatment, exhibit decreased susceptibility to treatment including antivirals, monoclonal antibodies and convalescent plasma, possess the ability to cause reinfection in previously infected and recovered individuals, and vaccine breakthrough cases in fully vaccinated individuals. Hence, continuation of precautionary measures, genomic surveillance and vaccination plays an important role in the prevention of spread, early identification of variants, prevention of mutations and viral replication, respectively.","Vasireddy, Deepa; Vanaparthy, Rachana; Mohan, Gisha; Malayala, Srikrishna Varun; Atluri, Paavani",J Clin Med Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34267839/; https://doi.org/10.14740/jocmr4518,259

It is only when the cough becomes persistent that they seek medical assistance. It is not known why patients cough in association with an acute upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), although interest has focused on how viruses may influence airway sensory nerve function and contribute to heightened cough reflex sensitivity. Why some patients develop a persistent cough following a viral URTI is also unclear. Much more is known about the causes and aggravants of chronic cough although there is no broad agreement as to the best way to manage such patients. Asthma, upper gastrointestinal dysfunction and rhinitis are frequently associated with chronic cough, although the impact of cough in suppurative lung disease and interstitial lung fibrosis is rarely considered. The development of effective treatments for cough remains a challenge and will require co-operation between clinicians, scientists and the pharmaceutical industry.","McGarvey, L.P.A.; Nishino, T.",Pulm Pharmacol Ther,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1094553904000823; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15564075/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1094553904000823,259

Guidelines from various clinical societies, along with direction from local health authorities, must be considered when approaching the care of an obstetric patient with known or suspected COVID-19. With a rapidly changing landscape, a simplified and cohesive perspective using guidance from different clinical society recommendations regarding the critically-ill obstetric patient with COVID-19 is needed. In this article, we synthesize various high-level guidelines of clinical relevance in the management of pregnant patients with severe disease or critical illness due to COVID-19. Key Points: When caring for severely ill obstetric patients with COVID-19, one must be well versed in the complications that may need to be managed including, but not limited to adult respiratory distress syndrome with need for mechanical ventilation, approach to refractory hypoxemia, hemodynamic shock, and multiorgan system failure. Prone positioning can be done safely in gravid patients but requires key areas of support to avoid abdominal compression. For the critically ill obstetric patient with COVID-19, the focus should be on supportive care as a bridge to recovery rather than delivery as a solution to recovery.","Oxford-Horrey, Corrina; Savage, Megan; Prabhu, Malavika; Abramovitz, Sharon; Griffin, Kelly; LaFond, Elyse; Riley, Laura; Easter, Sarah Rae",Am J Perinatol,https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0040-1713121; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32575140/,259

Here, we developed and piloted Serosurveillance for Continuous, ActionabLe Epidemiologic Intelligence of Transmission (SCALE-IT), a platform through which we systematically tested remnant samples from routine blood draws in two major hospital networks in San Francisco for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies during the early months of the pandemic. Importantly, SCALE-IT allows for algorithmic sample selection and rich data on covariates by leveraging electronic health record data. We estimated overall seroprevalence at 4.2%, corresponding to a case ascertainment rate of only 4.9%, and identified important heterogeneities by neighborhood, homelessness status, and race/ethnicity. Neighborhood seroprevalence estimates from SCALE-IT were comparable to local community-based surveys, while providing results encompassing the entire city that have been previously unavailable. Leveraging this hybrid serosurveillance approach has strong potential for application beyond this local context and for diseases other than SARS-CoV-2.","Routledge, Isobel; Epstein, Adrienne; Takahashi, Saki; Janson, Owen; Hakim, Jill; Duarte, Elias; Turcios, Keirstinne; Vinden, Joanna; Sujishi, Kirk; Rangel, Jesus; Coh, Marcelina; Besana, Lee; Ho, Wai-Kit; Oon, Ching-Ying; Ong, Chui Mei; Yun, Cassandra; Lynch, Kara; Wu, Alan H.

Much data derives from early in the pandemic, when schools were uniformly remote and personal/family stressors related to the pandemic were limited. This cross-sectional study, conducted during Fall 2020, examines the correlation between mental wellbeing and COVID-19-related changes in technology use, along with influence of COVID-19-related stressors, school status (in-person versus remote), and social media use for coping purposes, among 978 U.S. adolescents. Results suggest self-reported daily social media and technology use increased significantly from prior to COVID-19 through Fall 2020. Increased social media use was significantly associated with higher levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms regardless of other theoretical moderators or confounders of mental health (e.g., demographics, school status, importance of technology, COVID-19-related stress). Despite literature suggesting that remote learning may result in adverse mental health outcomes, we did not find local school reopening to be associated with current depressive/anxiety symptoms, nor with COVID-19-related increases in technology use. Self-reported use of social media for coping purposes moderated the association between increased social media use and mental health symptoms; in other words, some social media use may have positive effects. Although much prior research has focused on social media use as a marker of stress, we also found that increased video gaming and TV/movie watching were also associated with internalizing symptoms, in accordance with others' work. Future research should explore in more granular detail what, if any, social media and technology use is protective during a pandemic, and for whom, to help tailor prevention efforts.","Burke, T.

These mAbs were isolated from two donors who had recovered from COVID-19 infection during the first pandemic peak in the Lombardy region of Italy, the first European and initially most affected region in March 2020. We used the method of EBV immortalization of purified memory B cells and supernatant screening with a spike S1/2 assay for mAb isolation. This method allowed rapid isolation of clones, with one donor showing about 7% of clones positive against spike protein, whereas the other donor did not produce positive clones out of 91 tested. RNA was extracted from positive clones 39–47 days post-EBV infection, allowing VH and VL sequencing. The same clones were sequenced again after a further 100 days in culture, showing that no mutation had taken place during in vitro expansion. The B cell clones could be expanded in culture for more than 4 months after EBV immortalization and secreted the antibodies stably during that time, allowing to purify mg quantities of each mAb for functional assays without generating recombinant proteins. Unfortunately, neither mAb had significant neutralizing activity in a virus infection assay with several different SARS-CoV-2 isolates.

Yet a direct demonstration that vitamin D deficiency is associated with COVID-19 fatalities has remained elusive. We show here in a comparison of 32 countries that countries with high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency among elderly females show a confirmed case fatality rate twice as high as those with low prevalence.

In COVID-19, the strength of immune and respiratory systems is a critical element. Thus, this review was conducted to demonstrate the short and long term effects of increasing the aerobic capacity on increasing the function and strength of immune and respiratory systems, particularly those essential for overcoming COVID-19 infections and associated disorders. METHODS: This review was carried out by searching in Web of Science, Scopus, EBSCO, Medline databases. The search was conducted over clinical trials and literature and systematic reviews on the effects of increasing the aerobic capacity on the function and strength of specific immune and respiratory elements essential for overcoming COVID-19 infections. RESULTS: This review found that increasing the aerobic capacity could produce short-term safe improvements in the function of immune and respiratory systems, particularly those specific for COVID-19 infections. This could be mainly produced through three mechanisms. Firstly, it could improve immunity by increasing the level and function of immune cells and immunoglobulins, regulating CRP levels, and decreasing anxiety and depression. Secondly, it could improve respiratory system functions by acting as an antibiotic, antioxidant, and antimycotic, restoring normal lung tissue elasticity and strength. Lastly, it could act as a protective barrier to decrease COVID-19 risk factors, which helps to decrease the incidence and progression of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: This review summarizes that increasing the aerobic capacity is recommended because it has potential of improving immune and respiratory functions which would help counter COVID-19.","Mohamed, Ayman; Alawna, Motaz",Diabetes Metab Syndr,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S187140212030103X?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S187140212030103X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dsx.2020.04.038; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388326/,259

FIPVs are suggested to emerge from feline enteric coronaviruses (FECVs) by acquiring mutations in specific genes in the course of persistent infections. Although numerous studies identified mutations predicted to be responsible for the FECV-FIPV biotype switch, the presumed roles of specific genetic changes in FIP pathogenesis have not been confirmed experimentally. Reverse genetics systems established previously for serotype I and the less common serotype II FCoVs were based on cell culture-adapted FIPV strains which, however, were shown to be unsuitable for FIP pathogenesis studies in vivo. To date, systems to produce and manipulate recombinant serotype I field viruses have not been developed, mainly because these viruses cannot be grown in vitro. Here, we report the first reverse genetics system based on a serotype I FECV field isolate that is suitable to produce high-titer stocks of recombinant FECVs. We demonstrate that these recombinant viruses cause productive persistent infections in cats that are similar to what is observed in natural infections. The system provides an excellent tool for studying FCoVs that do not grow in standard cell culture systems and will greatly facilitate studies into the molecular pathogenesis of FIP. Importantly, the system could also be adapted for studies of other RNA viruses with large genomes whose production and characterization in vivo are currently hampered by the lack of in vitro propagation systems.","Ehmann, Rosina; Kristen-Burmann, Claudia; Bank-Wolf, Barbara; König, Matthias; Herden, Christiane; Hain, Torsten; Thiel, Heinz-Jürgen; Ziebuhr, John; Tekes, Gergely",mBio,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30065095/; https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.01422-18,259

In order to help the world better combat COVID-19 and reduce its death toll, this study focuses on the COVID-19 mortality. First, using the multiple stepwise regression analysis method, the factors from eight aspects (economy, society, climate etc.) that may affect the mortality rates of COVID-19 in various countries is examined. In addition, a two-layer nested heterogeneous ensemble learning-based prediction method that combines linear regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), and extreme learning machine (ELM) is developed to predict the development trends of COVID-19 mortality in various countries. Based on data from 79 countries, the experiment proves that age structure (proportion of the population over 70 years old) and medical resources (number of beds) are the main factors affecting the mortality of COVID-19 in each country. In addition, it is found that the number of nucleic acid tests and climatic factors are correlated with COVID-19 mortality.

METHODS: This cohort study from the Cerner Real World Database (87 US health systems) from December 1, 2019 to September 30, 2020 included PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients who self-identified as non-Hispanic Black (Black), Hispanic White (Hispanic), or non-Hispanic White (White). The main outcome was hospitalization among ED patients. Secondary outcomes included mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit care, and in-hospital mortality. Descriptive statistics and Poisson regression compared sociodemographics, comorbidities, receipt of remdesivir, receipt of dexamethasone, and outcomes by racial/ethnic groups and geographic region. RESULTS: 94,683 COVID-19 patients presented to the ED. Blacks comprised 26.7% and Hispanics 33.6%. Nearly half (45.1%) of ED patients presented to hospitals in the South. 31.4% (n=29,687) were hospitalized. Lower proportions of Blacks were prescribed dexamethasone (29.4%; n=7,426) compared to Hispanics (40.9%; n=13,021) and Whites (37.5%; n=14,088).

Pre-existing cross-reactive antibodies against other flaviviruses could modulate immune responses to ZIKV infection by antibody-dependent enhancement, highlighting the importance of understanding the immunogenicity of the ZIKV envelope protein. In this study, we identified a panel of human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that target domain III (DIII) of the ZIKV envelope protein from a very large phage-display naive antibody library. These germline-like antibodies, sharing 98%–100% hoLogy with their corresponding germline IGHV genes, bound ZIKV DIII specifically with high affinities. One mAb, m301, broadly neutralized the currently circulating ZIKV strains and showed a synergistic effect with another mAb, m302, in neutralizing ZIKV in vitro and in a mouse model of ZIKV infection. Interestingly, epitope mapping and competitive binding studies suggest that m301 and m302 bind adjacent regions of the DIII C–C′ loop, which represents a recently identified cryptic epitope that is intermittently exposed in an uncharacterized virus conformation.

The analysis revealed the following: 1) COVID-19 spread from Wuhan to other cities and rural areas in Hubei, but the disease did not become widespread in rural villages because of strict prevention measures and urbanization; 2) According to the fluctuation in the number of confirmed cases reported in Hubei after January 23, 2020, we inferred that the infected patients on the same day will become ill during the next 20 days; 3) the advanced traffic system facilitates the direct spread of COVID-19 from Wuhan to counties, towns, and villages in the Hubei Province. There is a low possibility of COVID-19 spread from prefecture-level cities to rural areas.

606160,Management and outcomes of post-acute COVID-19 patients in Northern Italy,2020-06-10,"BACKGROUND: Emergency department (ED) visits show a high volatility over time. Therefore, EDs are likely to be crowded at peak-volume moments. ED crowding is a widely reported problem with negative consequences for patients as well as staff. Previous studies on the predictive value of weather variables on ED visits show conflicting results. Also, no such studies were performed in the Netherlands. Therefore, we evaluated prediction models for the number of ED visits in our large the Netherlands teaching hospital based on calendar and weather variables as potential predictors. METHODS: Data on all ED visits from June 2016 until December 31, 2019, were extracted. The 2016–2018 data were used as training set, the 2019 data as test set. Weather data were extracted from three publicly available datasets from the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute. Weather observations in proximity of the hospital were used to predict the weather in the hospital’s catchment area by applying the inverse distance weighting interpolation method. The predictability of daily ED visits was examined by creating linear prediction models using stepwise selection; the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) was used as measurement of fit. RESULTS: The number of daily ED visits shows a positive time trend and a large impact of calendar events (higher on Mondays and Fridays, lower on Saturdays and Sundays, higher at special times such as carnival, lower in holidays falling on Monday through Saturday, and summer vacation). The weather itself was a better predictor than weather volatility, but only showed a small effect; the calendar-only prediction model had very similar coefficients to the calendar+weather model for the days of the week, time trend, and special time periods (both MAPE’s were 8.7%). CONCLUSIONS: Because of this similar performance, and the inaccuracy caused by weather forecasts, we decided the calendar-only model would be most useful in our hospital; it can probably be transferred for use in EDs of the same size and in a similar region.

607078,Hydroxychloroquine as pre-exposure prophylaxis for COVID-19 in healthcare workers: a randomized trial,2020-10-17,"BACKGROUND: In the case of ischemic stroke, access to a Computed Tomography (CT) scanner and the start of thrombolytic therapy immediately is imperative. Transport to the nearest hospital from the remote, rural area of Hallingdal in Norway entails a 2–3 h drive. The local medical centre in this area has a CT-scanner operated by radiographers during office hours. Out-of-hours stroke evaluation and treatment has been the focus of a research project. Paramedics position the patient in the CT-scanner. A radiographer at the participating hospital runs a remote-controlled scan and a junior doctor instructs a paramedic in the performance of a neurological examination. The aim of this study was to explore how radiographers, paramedics and junior doctors experience conducting telemedicine-based stroke evaluation and treatment. METHODS: Six semi-structured interviews were conducted with radiographers, paramedics and junior doctors; with remote control, CT examination and stroke management as central issues. Core issues in the interview guide were: communication; cooperation; competence; service quality and training. The study employed thematic content analysis in analysing the data inductively. RESULTS: The analysis gave an overview of the patient flow and communication routines in this service. Further findings were divided into two main themes, “Teamwork” and “Quality”. The theme “Teamwork” included three categories “Communication”, “Trust and confidence”, and “Task and task shifting”. The theme “Quality” included two categories “Education and training” and “Safety and routines”. The respondents considered the service to be of high quality and that the team functioned at a high level as a result of regular training sessions. However, communication and image reading routines could be improved. CONCLUSIONS: The telemedicine-based, remote controlled, stroke evaluation and treatment was experienced, by the participants, to be well organised and of high quality. Communication and image reading appear to be the salient challenges. Regular training sessions and follow-up, as well as an evaluation of incidents by the project manager, proved to be of great importance in retaining and securing the continued running of the service and ensuring high-quality treatment. Further research is indicated in the comparison of this telemedicine service with stroke treatment given in a mainstream hospital.","Kjelle, Elin; Myklebust, Aud Mette",BMC Health Serv Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34090447/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-021-06591-1,259

The aim of this research is to contribute to this understanding for the purpose of affecting future practical preventive policies that can be implemented and adapted in Palestine in order to shape a new reflective practices model to face any future epidemic crisis of any type. A cross-sectional design was used to conduct the study over 3 weeks in April 2020 and an online survey was disseminated in all areas of Palestine. A total of 1040 responses were collected from persons who were over 18 years of age. A high level of knowledge related to COVID-19 was found, including symptoms and characteristics of the virus, prevention practices, and at-risk groups. Respondents believe that they are more susceptible to influenza than COVID-19 and more likely to be infected by the influenza virus than the COVID-19 virus but expect that infection of influenza would be less severe than infection of COVID-19. Respondents were more inclined to find COVID-19 worrying and stressful than they were to find it fear-inducing. Around two-thirds of respondents believe that different types of COVID-19-related conspiracy theories are true to some degree. Going forward, it is crucial and essential to provide basic awareness among large populations around diseases, which can contribute to positively influencing people's knowledge and attitudes and their perception toward such diseases and combat conspiracy theories.","Salameh, Basma Salim; Basha, Sami; Abdallah, Jihad; Basha, Walid",Glob Health Promot,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34510988/; https://doi.org/10.1177/17579759211035092,259
608302,The Role of Incentive Spirometry for Patients with COVID-19,2021-05-15,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: The spread of citrus Huanglongbing caused significant damage to the world’s citrus industry. Thermotherapy and chemical agents were used to control this disease; however, the effectiveness of these treatments is frequently inconsistent. In addition, CLas cannot be cultured in vitro. Therefore, structure-based virtual screening is a novel method to find compounds that work against CLas. This study used CLas GMPS as a target for high-throughput screening and selected some compounds which have a higher binding affinity to test their inhibition of CLas GMPS. Finally, two molecules were identified as the lead compound to control citrus HLB. ABSTRACT: Citrus production is facing an unprecedented problem because of huanglongbing (HLB) disease. Presently, no effective HLB-easing method is available when citrus becomes infected. Guanosine 5′-monophosphate synthetase (GMPS) is a key protein in the de novo synthesis of guanine nucleotides. GMPS is used as an attractive target for developing agents that are effective against the patogen infection. In this research, homology modeling, structure-based virtual screening, and molecular docking were used to discover the new inhibitors against CLas GMPS. Enzyme assay showed that folic acid and AZD1152 showed high inhibition at micromole concentrations, with AZD1152 being the most potent molecule. The inhibition constant (K(i)) value of folic acid and AZD1152 was 51.98 µM and 4.05 µM, respectively. These results suggested that folic acid and AZD1152 could be considered as promising candidates for the development of CLas agents.","Nan, Jing; Zhang, Shaoran; Zhan, Ping; Jiang, Ling",Biology (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34203217/; https://doi.org/10.3390/biology10070594,259
609826,Impacts of the 2008 Great Recession on dietary intake: a systematic review and meta-analysis,2021-04-29,"A significant proportion of COVID-19 patients are suffering from prolonged Post-COVID-19 Fatigue Syndrome, with characteristics typically found in Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS). However, no clear pathophysiological explanation, as yet, has been provided. A novel paradigm for a Post-COVID-19 Fatigue Syndrome is developed here from a recent unifying model for ME/CFS. Central to its rationale, SARS-CoV-2, in common with the triggers (viral and non-viral) of ME/CFS, is proposed to be a physiologically severe stressor, which could be targeting a stress-integrator, within the brain: the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN). It is proposed that inflammatory mediators, released at the site of COVID-19 infection, would be transmitted as stress-signals, via humoral and neural pathways, which overwhelm this stress-center. In genetically susceptible people, an intrinsic stress-threshold is suggested to be exceeded causing ongoing dysfunction to the hypothalamic PVN's complex neurological circuitry. In this compromised state, the hypothalamic PVN might then be hyper-sensitive to a wide range of life's ongoing physiological stressors. This could result in the reported post-exertional malaise episodes and more severe relapses, in common with ME/CFS, that perpetuate an ongoing disease state. When a certain stress-tolerance-level is exceeded, the hypothalamic PVN can become an epicenter for microglia-induced activation and neuroinflammation, affecting the hypothalamus and its proximal limbic system, which would account for the range of reported ME/CFS-like symptoms. A model for Post-COVID-19 Fatigue Syndrome is provided to stimulate discussion and critical evaluation. Brain-scanning studies, incorporating increasingly sophisticated imaging technology should enable chronic neuroinflammation to be detected, even at a low level, in the finite detail required, thus helping to test this model, while advancing our understanding of Post-COVID-19 Fatigue Syndrome pathophysiology.","Mackay, Angus",Front Neurol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2021.701419; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34408721/,259

However, amplitude and timing of the interferon response is of utmost importance for preventing an underwhelming outcome, or tissue damage. While several pathogens evolved strategies for disturbing the quality of interferon signaling, there is growing evidence that this pathway can be regulated by several members of the Nod-like receptor (NLR) family, although the precise mechanism for most of these remains elusive. NLRs consist of a family of about 20 proteins in mammals, which are capable of sensing microbial products as well as endogenous signals related to tissue injury. Here we provide an overview of our current understanding of the function of those NLRs in type I interferon responses with a focus on viral infections. We discuss how NLR-mediated type I interferon regulation can influence the development of auto-immunity and the immune response to infection.","Kienes, Ioannis; Weidl, Tanja; Mirza, Nora; Chamaillard, Mathias; Kufer, Thomas A.",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33525590/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22031301,259

Preliminary IRT imaging demonstrated that foot temperatures increased in FMDV-infected animals. The maximum foot temperatures of healthy (n = 53), directly inoculated (DI) (n = 12), contact (CT) (n = 6), and vaccine trial (VT) (n = 21) cattle were measured over the course of FMD infection. A cut-off value was established at 34.4 °C (sensitivity = 61.1%, specificity = 87.7%) with the aim of detecting FMDV-infected animals both before and after clinical signs were observed. Seven of 12 (58%) DI and 3/6 (50%) CT animals showed maximum foot temperatures exceeding the 34.4 °C cut-off before the development of foot vesicles. In contrast, only 5/21 (24%) VT animals displayed pre-clinical foot temperatures above this cut-off possibly indicating partial vaccine protection of this group. These results show IRT as a promising screening technology to quickly identify potentially infected animals for confirmatory diagnostic testing during FMD outbreaks. Further evaluation of this technology is needed to determine the value of IRT in detecting animals with mild clinical signs or sub-clinical infections.","Rainwater-Lovett, Kaitlin; Pacheco, Juan M.; Packer, Craig; Rodriguez, Luis L.",Vet J,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tvjl.2008.01.003; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090023308000129; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1090023308000129; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18308596/,259

Pour pouvoir contrôler son émergence et minimiser la morbidité et la mortalité associées, il faudrait adapter les comportements, qui sont influencés par les connaissances et les perceptions, notamment en milieu de soins. Dans cette optique, cette étude visait à évaluer le niveau de connaissance, des attitudes et des pratiques des étudiants en médecine (EEM) à l’égard du COVID-19 et à identifier leurs facteurs associés. Matériels et méthodes Une étude transversale portant sur 431 EEM des différents niveaux d’étude a été menée à la faculté de médecine en novembre 2020. Le recueil des données était fait par un auto-questionnaire administré via Google Forms administré dans les plateformes éducatives officielles de la faculté. Résultats Les scores globaux des connaissances, de l’attitude et des pratiques des EEM à l’égard du COVID-19 étaient de 74,6±13, 69±10,2 et 78,8±13,6/100, respectivement. Les EEM avaient un bon niveau de connaissance dans, 203 cas (47,1 %), une attitude positive dans 83 cas (19,3 %) et de bonnes pratiques dans 264 cas (61,3 %). L’analyse multivariée a révélé que les facteurs indépendants prédictifs de bonnes connaissances étaient le tabagisme actuel (odds ratio ajusté [ORA]=1,8 ; p =0,04), l’assistance antérieure à une formation sur le COVID (ORA=1,5 ; p =0,04) et le niveau élevé des études (ORA=2,4 ; p =0,02). L’antécédent de maladie chronique était un facteur indépendant d’une attitude positive (ORA=2,4 ; p =0,009), tandis que le tabagisme actif (ORA=0,4 ; p =0,01) était indépendamment associé à une attitude négative. L’utilisation des réseaux sociaux comme principale source d’information sur le COVID-19 était indépendamment associée à une mauvaise connaissance (ORA=0,5 ; p =0,01) et à une attitude négative (ORA=0,4 ; p =0,008). Les facteurs indépendants de bonnes pratiques étaient le niveau élevé des études (ORA=2,4 ; p =0,01), avoir un contact étroit avec une personne atteinte du COVID-19 (AOR=2,1 ; p =0,04), l’assistance à une formation sur le COVID-19 (ORA=1,5 ; p =0,04) et avoir de bonnes connaissances (ORA=2,2 ; p <0,001). Conclusion Les EEM avaient un niveau satisfaisant des connaissances et des pratiques à l’égard du COVID-19, mais leur attitude était majoritairement négative.

Thousands of SARS-CoV-2 strains have been sequenced to date, providing a valuable opportunity to investigate the evolution of the virus on a global scale. We performed a phylogenetic analysis of over 1,225 SARS-CoV-2 genomes spanning from late December 2019 to mid-March 2020. We identified a missense mutation, D614G, in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, which has emerged as a predominant clade in Europe (954 of 1,449 (66%) sequences) and is spreading worldwide (1,237 of 2,795 (44%) sequences). Molecular dating analysis estimated the emergence of this clade around mid-to-late January (10 - 25 January) 2020. We also applied structural bioinformatics to assess D614G potential impact on the virulence and epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2. In silico analyses on the spike protein structure suggests that the mutation is most likely neutral to protein function as it relates to its interaction with the human ACE2 receptor.

615726,Attitudes to Vaccination After the First Wave of COVID-19,2021,"Eukaryotic ribosomal frameshift signals generally contain two elements, a heptanucleotide slippery sequence (XXXYYYN) and an RNA secondary structure, often an RNA pseudoknot, located downstream. Frameshifting takes place at the slippery sequence by simultaneous slippage of two ribosome-bound tRNAs. All of the tRNAs that are predicted to decode frameshift sites in the ribosomal A-site (XXXYYYN) possess a hypermodified base in the anticodon-loop and it is conceivable that these modifications play a role in the frameshift process. To test this, we expressed slippery sequence variants of the coronavirus IBV frameshift signal in strains of Escherichia coli unable to modify fully either tRNA(Lys) or tRNA(Asn). At the slippery sequences UUUAAAC and UUUAAAU (underlined codon decoded by tRNA(Asn), anticodon 5′ QUU 3′), frameshifting was very inefficient (2 to 3%) and in strains deficient in the biosynthesis of Q base, was increased (AAU) or decreased (AAC) only two-fold. In E. coli, therefore, hypomodification of tRNA(Asn) had little effect on frameshifting. The situation with the efficient slippery sequences UUUAAAA (15%) and UUUAAAG (40%) (underlined codon decoded by tRNA(Lys), anticodon 5′ mnm(5)s(2)UUU 3′) was more complex, since the wobble base of tRNA(Lys) is modified at two positions. Of four available mutants, only trmE (s(2)UUU) had a marked influence on frameshifting, increasing the efficiency of the process at the slippery sequence UUUAAAA. No effect on frameshifting was seen in trmC1 (cmnm(5)s(2)UUU) or trmC2 (nm(5)s(2)UUU) strains and only a very small reduction (at UUUAAAG) was observed in an asuE (mnm(5)UUU) strain. The slipperiness of tRNA(Lys), therefore, cannot be ascribed to a single modification site on the base. However, the data support a role for the amino group of the mnm(5) substitution in shaping the anticodon structure. Whether these conclusions can be extended to eukaryotic translation systems is uncertain. Although E. coli ribosomes changed frame at the IBV signal (UUUAAAG) with an efficiency similar to that measured in reticulocyte lysates (40%), there were important qualitative differences. Frameshifting of prokaryotic ribosomes was pseudoknot-independent (although secondary structure dependent) and appeared to require slippage of only a single tRNA.","Brierley, Ian; Meredith, Michayla R; Bloys, Alison J; Hagervall, Tord G",J Mol Biol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022283697911347; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9237903/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283697911347,259
615852,The Independent Risk of Obesity and Diabetes and Their Interaction in COVID‐19: A Retrospective Cohort Study,2021-04-28,"BACKGROUND: Various techniques are used to support contact tracing, which has been shown to be highly effective against the COVID-19 pandemic. To apply the technology, either quarantine authorities should provide the location history of patients with COVID-19, or all users should provide their own location history. This inevitably exposes either the patient’s location history or the personal location history of other users. Thus, a privacy issue arises where the public good (via information release) comes in conflict with privacy exposure risks. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to develop an effective contact tracing system that does not expose the location information of the patient with COVID-19 to other users of the system, or the location information of the users to the quarantine authorities. METHODS: We propose a new protocol called PRivacy Oriented Technique for Epidemic Contact Tracing (PROTECT) that securely shares location information of patients with users by using the Brakerski/Fan-Vercauteren homomorphic encryption scheme, along with a new, secure proximity computation method. RESULTS: We developed a mobile app for the end-user and a web service for the quarantine authorities by applying the proposed method, and we verified their effectiveness. The proposed app and web service compute the existence of intersections between the encrypted location history of patients with COVID-19 released by the quarantine authorities and that of the user saved on the user’s local device. We also found that this contact tracing smartphone app can identify whether the user has been in contact with such patients within a reasonable time. CONCLUSIONS: This newly developed method for contact tracing shares location information by using homomorphic encryption, without exposing the location information of patients with COVID-19 and other users. Homomorphic encryption is challenging to apply to practical issues despite its high security value. In this study, however, we have designed a system using the Brakerski/Fan-Vercauteren scheme that is applicable to a reasonable size and developed it to an operable format. The developed app and web service can help contact tracing for not only the COVID-19 pandemic but also other epidemics.","An, Yongdae; Lee, Seungmyung; Jung, Seungwoo; Park, Howard; Song, Yongsoo; Ko, Taehoon",J Med Internet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33999829/; https://doi.org/10.2196/26371,259

Moreover, CCI (p<0.001), DLCO/VA% (p=0.002), cigarette pack/year (p<0.001), BMI (p<0.001) and COVID-19 (p<0.001) were associated with death. Patients who undergo lung resection and then develop symptomatic COVID-19 infection are at higher risk of developing severe respiratory complications and postoperative death. Insidious symptoms’ onset may lead to a delay in diagnosis. We suggest two mitigating strategies: 1) Improve symptoms surveillance and isolation during recovery period, 2) Be aware of a potential greater risk of developing symptomatic COVID-19 and death correlated with elevated CCI, BMI, smoking history, DLCO/VA%, number of resected segments and duration of surgery.","Scarci, Marco; Raveglia, Federico; Bortolotti, Luigi; Benvenuti, Mauro; Merlo, Luca; Petrella, Lea; Cardillo, Giuseppe; Rocco, Gaetano",Semin Thorac Cardiovasc Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33989754/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1043067921001866; https://doi.org/10.1053/j.semtcvs.2021.03.038; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043067921001866?v=s5,259

The paper presents the results of an analysis of participants' motivations on the factors leading to conducting drills on 19 September every year in Mexico City; the sample size considered for the analysis was N = 2400. In particular, the following research question has been addressed: What factors predict the likelihood that respondents would report that they agree on conducting mass evacuation drills yearly? The approach has been the application of logistic regression technique to identify these factors. Of the 19 initial explanatory variables, in the final model, only seven variables and one interaction term, were significantly associated with the outcome variable; i.e.: age (Odds Ratio (OR) = 1.366; 95% Confidence Interval (CI) = 1.039–1.795); occupation (OR = 3.378; CI = 1.457–7.830); frequency of drills: one/year (OR = 2.128; CI = 1.610–2.812); knowledge vs. drills (OR = 1.394; CI = 1.172–1.658); ‘perception vulnerability city’ (OR = 1.271; CI = 1.091–1.480); warning time (OR = 1.266; CI = 1.1036–1.548); usefulness of the SASMEX (OR = 0.783; CI = 0.615-0.998); and ‘perception vulnerability city’ by occupation interaction (OR = 0.786; CI = 0.643-0.961).

Cardiac operations in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 have been imperative due to their emergency nature, critical condition of patients awaiting cardiac surgery, and accumulated number of cardiac surgical interventions throughout the last months. CASE SUMMARY: Here we describe three COVID-19 positive cases who underwent coronary surgery, on an urgent basis. We did not experience worsening of the patients’ clinical condition due to COVID-19 and therefore a routine post-operative chest X-ray (CXR) was not required. None of the health care providers attending the patients endured cross infection. Further trials would be needed in order to confirm these results. CONCLUSION: While the pandemic has adversely hit the health systems worldwide, cardiac surgical patients who concomitantly contracted COVID-19 may undergo a smooth post-operative course as a routine post-operative CXR may not be required.","Omar, Amr Salah; Shoman, Bassam; Sudarsanan, Suraj; Shouman, Yasser",World J Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34079694/; https://doi.org/10.5501/wjv.v10.i3.130,259
619529,Novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID‐19): Emergence and implications for emergency care,2020-02-22,"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic highlights the necessity for a more fundamental understanding of the coronavirus life cycle. The causative agent of the disease, SARS-CoV-2, is being studied extensively from a structural standpoint in order to gain insight into key molecular mechanisms required for its survival. Contained within the untranslated regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome are various conserved stem-loop elements that are believed to function in RNA replication, viral protein translation, and discontinuous transcription. While the majority of these regions are variable in sequence, a 41-nucleotide s2m element within the 3’ UTR is highly conserved among coronaviruses and three other viral families. In this study, we demonstrate that the s2m element of SARS-CoV-2 dimerizes by forming an intermediate homodimeric kissing complex structure that is subsequently converted to a thermodynamically stable duplex conformation. This process is aided by the viral nucleocapsid protein, potentially indicating a role in mediating genome dimerization. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the s2m element interacts with multiple copies of host cellular miRNA-1307-3p. Taken together, our results highlight the potential significance of the dimer structures formed by the s2m element in key biological processes and implicate the motif as a possible therapeutic drug target for COVID-19 and other coronavirus-related diseases.","Imperatore, Joshua A.; Cunningham, Caylee L.; Pellegrene, Kendy A.; Brinson, Robert G.; Marino, John P.; Evanseck, Jeffrey D.; Mihailescu, Mihaela Rita",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.29.424733,259

To achieve the non-selective amplification and recovery of low abundance genetic sequences, a simplified Sequence-Independent, Single-Primer Amplification (SISPA) technique in combination with MiSeq platform was applied to target negative- and positive-sense single-stranded RNA viral sequences. This method allowed successful sequence assembly of full or near full length avian influenza virus (AIV), infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), and Newcastle disease virus (NDV) viral genome. Moreover, SISPA analysis applied to unknown clinical cases of mixed viral infections produced genome assemblies comprising 98% NDV and 99% of IBV genomes. Complete or near complete virus genome sequence was obtained with titers at or above 10(4.5) EID(50)/ml (50% embryo infectious dose), and virus identification could be detected with titers at or above 10(3) EID(50)/ml.

In humans IFNL4 open reading frame is truncated by a polymorphic frame-shift insertion that eliminates IFN-λ4 and turns IFNL4 into a polymorphic pseudogene. Functional IFN-λ4 has antiviral activity but the elimination of IFN-λ4 through pseudogenization is strongly associated with improved clearance of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. We show that functional IFN-λ4 is conserved and evolutionarily constrained in mammals and thus functionally relevant. However, the pseudogene has reached moderately high frequency in Africa, America, and Europe, and near fixation in East Asia. In fact, the pseudogenizing variant is among the 0.8% most differentiated SNPs between Africa and East Asia genome-wide. Its raise in frequency is associated with additional evidence of positive selection, which is strongest in East Asia, where this variant falls in the 0.5% tail of SNPs with strongest signatures of recent positive selection genome-wide. Using a new Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) approach we infer that the pseudogenizing allele appeared just before the out-of-Africa migration and was immediately targeted by moderate positive selection; selection subsequently strengthened in European and Asian populations resulting in the high frequency observed today. This provides evidence for a changing adaptive process that, by favoring IFN-λ4 inactivation, has shaped present-day phenotypic diversity and susceptibility to disease.","Key, Felix M.; Peter, Benjamin; Dennis, Megan Y.; Huerta-Sánchez, Emilia; Tang, Wei; Prokunina-Olsson, Ludmila; Nielsen, Rasmus; Andrés, Aida M.",PLoS Genet,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004681; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25329461/,259

620493,Temperature screening has negligible value for control of COVID‐19,2020-06-24,"BACKGROUND: Human mesenchymal stem cells from dental pulp (hMSC-DP), including dental pulp stem cells from permanent teeth and exfoliated deciduous teeth, possess unique MSC characteristics such as expression of specific surface molecules and a high proliferation rate. Since hMSC-DP have been applied in numerous clinical studies, it is necessary to establish criteria to evaluate their potency for cell-based therapies. METHODS: We compared stem cell properties of hMSC-DP at passages 5, 10 and 20 under serum (SE) and serum-free (SF) culture conditions. Cell morphology, proliferation capacity, chromosomal stability, surface phenotypic profiles, differentiation and immunoregulation ability were evaluated. In addition, we assessed surface molecule that regulates hMSC-DP proliferation and immunomodulation. RESULTS: hMSC-DP exhibited a decrease in proliferation rate and differentiation potential, as well as a reduced expression of CD146 when cultured under continuous passage conditions. SF culture conditions failed to alter surface marker expression, chromosome stability or proliferation rate when compared to SE culture. SF-cultured hMSC-DP were able to differentiate into osteogenic, adipogenic and neural cells, and displayed the capacity to regulate immune responses. Notably, the expression level of CD146 showed a positive correlation with proliferation, differentiation, and immunomodulation, suggesting that CD146 can serve as a surface molecule to evaluate the potency of hMSC-DP. Mechanistically, we found that CD146 regulates proliferation and immunomodulation of hMSC-DP through the ERK/p-ERK pathway. CONCLUSION: This study indicates that SF-cultured hMSC-DP are appropriate for producing clinical-grade cells. CD146 is a functional surface molecule to assess the potency of hMSC-DP.

We estimated the absolute and proportional COVID‐19 hospitalizations in US adults attributable to 4 major US cardiometabolic conditions, separately and jointly, and by race/ethnicity, age, and sex. METHODS AND RESULTS: We used the best available estimates of independent associations of cardiometabolic conditions with a risk of COVID‐19 hospitalization; nationally representative data on cardiometabolic conditions from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2015 to 2018; and US COVID‐19 hospitalizations stratified by age, sex, and race/ethnicity from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Coronavirus Disease 2019–Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network database and from the COVID Tracking Project to estimate the numbers and proportions of COVID‐19 hospitalizations attributable to diabetes mellitus, obesity, hypertension, and heart failure. Inputs were combined in a comparative risk assessment framework, with probabilistic sensitivity analyses and 1000 Monte Carlo simulations to jointly incorporate stratum‐specific uncertainties in data inputs. As of November 18, 2020, an estimated 906 849 COVID‐19 hospitalizations occurred in US adults. Of these, an estimated 20.5% (95% uncertainty interval [UIs], 18.9–22.1) of COVID‐19 hospitalizations were attributable to diabetes mellitus, 30.2% (UI, 28.2–32.3) to total obesity (body mass index ≥30 kg/m(2)), 26.2% (UI, 24.3–28.3) to hypertension, and 11.7% (UI, 9.5–14.1) to heart failure. Considered jointly, 63.5% (UI, 61.6–65.4) or 575 419 (UI, 559 072–593 412) of COVID‐19 hospitalizations were attributable to these 4 conditions. Large differences were seen in proportions of cardiometabolic risk–attributable COVID‐19 hospitalizations by age and race/ethnicity, with smaller differences by sex.

However, a retrospective surveillance study identified six children who had been hospitalized for COVID-19 in one of three central Wuhan hospitals between January 7th and January 15th. Given that Wuhan has over 395 other hospitals, there may have been far more severe pediatric cases than reported. There were six and 43 children out of 336 who tested positive for COVID-19 and influenza, respectively among all pediatric admissions during the 9-day period. By using this ratio in a detailed analysis of influenza surveillance data and COVID-19 epidemic dynamics (see Appendix), we estimate that there were 313 [95% CI: 171-520] children hospitalized for COVID-19 in Wuhan during January 7-15, 2020 (Figure). Under an epidemic doubling time of 7.31 days4, we estimate that there were 1105 [95% CI: 592, 1829] cumulative pediatric COVID-19 hospitalizations prior to the January 23rd lockdown, which far surpasses the 425 confirmed cases reported across all age groups, none of which were children under age 15. Children are strikingly absent from COVID-19 reports and limited data suggest that pediatric infections are overwhelmingly mild5. Thus, our estimates for hundreds of severe pediatric cases likely translates to thousands or even tens of thousands of mildly infected children, suggesting that the force of infection from children may be grossly underestimated and the infection fatality rate overestimated from confirmed case counts alone.

The primary outcomes are the prevalence rate of conjunctivitis/conjunctival congestion and the positive rate of conjunctival swab samples. Rates were expressed as proportions with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: A total of 12 studies with 1930 participants were included for meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence rate of conjunctivitis/conjunctival congestion was 8% (95% CI: 5%-12%). 1% (95% CI: 1%-4%) of COVID-19 patients were diagnosed with conjunctivitis/conjunctival congestion as the initial symptom. The pooled positive rate of conjunctival swab samples was 3% (95% CI: 2%-5%).

The Postpartum Specific Anxiety Scale (PSAS) predicts unique variance in postnatal outcomes over and above general anxiety tools. It has never been used in Iran and its validity and reliability have not been assessed either. Therefore, the present study aimed to translate and investigate the psychometric properties of the PSAS-IR. METHODS: 510 women, from six weeks to six months postpartum, were selected through random sampling in 2020. After forward and back-translation, the face validity, content validity, and construct validity of PSAS (through confirmatory factor analysis) were examined. The reliability of the scale was assessed using both internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha) and test-retest stability methods. RESULTS: CVI and CVR values of the PSAS tool were 0.89 and 0.88, respectively. The good fit indices confirmed the validity of four-factor structure. Cronbach’s alpha coefficient and Intra Correlation Coefficient (ICC) equaled 0.93 and 0.92, respectively. CONCLUSION: The Persian version of PSAS is a valid and reliable four-factor scale, it will improve the measurement of postpartum anxiety in an Iranian setting.

To facilitate the interpretation of total and differential white blood cell counts in pediatric patients, the present study investigated age-dependent changes in total and differential white blood cell counts in healthy reference children. METHODS: Data were obtained from the Pediatric Reference Intervals in China study (PRINCE), which aims to establish and verify pediatric reference intervals for Chinese children based on a nationwide multicenter cross-sectional study from January 2017 to December 2018. Quantile curves were calculated using the generalized additive models for location, shape, and scale method. The 2.5th, 50th, and 97.5th quantile curves were calculated for both total and differential white blood counts. Percents of stacked area charts were used to demonstrate the proportions of differential white blood cells. All statistical analyses were performed using R software. RESULTS: Both 50th and 97.5th quantiles of total white blood cell count and monocyte count were highest at birth, then rapidly decreased in the first 6 months of life; relatively slow reduction continued until 2 years of age. The lymphocyte count was low during infancy and increased to its highest level at 6 months of age; it then exhibited moderate and continuous reduction until approximately 9 years of age. The pattern of neutrophil count changed with age in a manner opposite to that of lymphocyte count. Besides, there were two inter-sections of lymphocyte count and neutrophil count during infancy and at approximately 5 years of age, based on locally weighted regression (LOESS) analysis. There were no apparent age-related changes in eosinophil or basophil counts.

DESIGN: Multicenter observational study. SETTING: Twenty-one U.K. PICUs. PATIENTS: Children (< 18 yr) admitted to U.K. PICUs between April 1, 2020, and May 10, 2020, fulfilling the U.K. case definition of pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Routinely collected, deidentified data were analyzed. Propensity score and linear mixed effects models were used to analyze the effect of steroids, IV immunoglobulin, and biologic agents on changes in C-reactive protein, platelet counts, and lymphocyte counts over the course of PICU stay. Treatment recommendations from U.K. clinical guidelines were analyzed. Over the 6-week study period, 59 of 78 children (76%) received IV immunoglobulin, 57 of 78 (73%) steroids, and 18 of 78 (24%) a biologic agent. We found no evidence of a difference in response in clinical markers of inflammation between patients with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children/pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 who were treated with IV immunoglobulin, steroids, or biologics, compared with those who were not. By the end of the study period, most patients had received immunomodulation. The 12 patients who did not receive any immunomodulators had similar decrease in inflammatory markers as those treated. Of the 14 guidelines analyzed, the use of IV immunoglobulin, steroids, and biologics was universally recommended. CONCLUSIONS: We were unable to identify any short-term benefit from any of the treatments, or treatment combinations, administered. Despite a lack of evidence, treatment guidelines for multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children/pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 have become very similar in advising step-wise treatments. Retaining clinical equipoise regarding treatment will allow clinicians to enroll children in robust clinical trials to determine the optimal treatment for this novel important condition.","Davies, Patrick; Lillie, Jon; Prayle, Andrew; Evans, Claire; Griffiths, Benedict; du Pré, Pascale; Johnson, Mae; Krishnan Kanthimathinathan, Hari; Playfor, Stephen; Deep, Akash; Brierley, Joe; Waters, Gareth; Mohammad, Zoha; Singh, Davinder; Jardine, Michelle; Ross, Oliver; Shetty, Nayan; Worrall, Mark; Sinha, Ruchi; Koul, Ashwani; Whittaker, Elizabeth; Vyas, Harish; Ramnarayan, Padmanabhan; Scholefield, Barnaby R.",Pediatr Crit Care Med,https://doi.org/10.1097/pcc.0000000000002728; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33767074/,259

They are widely available, cheap, and well-tolerated. Based on statins’ pleiotropic properties, including improvement of endothelial dysfunction, antioxidant properties, atherosclerotic plaque stabilization, and inhibition of inflammatory responses, it can be hypothesized that the use of statins, at least as an adjuvant in antiviral therapy, may be justified. All these effects might be especially beneficial in patients with COVID-19, suffering from endothelial dysfunction, microvascular and macrovascular thrombosis, and cytokine storm. Here, we review the recent data regarding the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 activity in host cells, proposed COVID-19 therapy, the pleiotropic activity of statins, and statins in clinical trials in respiratory infections. According to the guidelines of the European and American Cardiac Societies, in patients with cardiovascular disease or high cardiovascular risk with concomitant COVID-19 it is recommended to continue statin treatment. However, the initiation of statin therapy de novo in COVID-19 treatment should only be done as part of a clinical trial.","Olszewska-Parasiewicz, Justyna; Szarpak, Łukasz; Rogula, Sylwester; Gąsecka, Aleksandra; Szymańska, Urszula; Kwiatkowska, Maria; Jaguszewski, Milosz J.; Sierpiński, Radosław; Zaczyński, Artur; Wierzba, Waldemar; Kosior, Dariusz A.",Life (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34208435/; https://doi.org/10.3390/life11060565,259

We recently established that influenza virus is also transmissible via “aerosolized fomites,” micron-scale dust particulates released from virus-contaminated surfaces (Asadi et al. in Nat Commun 11(1):4062, 2020). Here we expand on this observation, by counting and characterizing the particles emitted from guinea pig cages using an Aerodynamic Particle Sizer (APS) and an Interferometric Mie Imaging (IMI) system. Of over 9000 airborne particles emitted from guinea pig cages and directly imaged with IMI, none had an interference pattern indicative of a liquid droplet. Separate measurements of the particle count using the APS indicate that particle concentrations spike upwards immediately following animal motion, then decay exponentially with a time constant commensurate with the air exchange rate in the cage. Taken together, the results presented here raise the possibility that a non-negligible fraction of airborne influenza transmission events between guinea pigs occurs via aerosolized fomites rather than respiratory droplets, though the relative frequencies of these two routes have yet to be definitively determined.","Asadi, Sima; Tupas, Manilyn J.; Barre, Ramya S.; Wexler, Anthony S.; Bouvier, Nicole M.; Ristenpart, William D.",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-96678-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34471147/,259
631628,Pneumonia in Adults: the Practical Emergency Department Perspective,2012-02-21,"The ability to provide timely identification of the causative agents of lower respiratory tract infections can promote better patient outcomes and support antimicrobial stewardship efforts. Current diagnostic testing options include culture, molecular testing, and antigen detection. These methods may require collection of various specimens, involve extensive sample treatment, and can suffer from low sensitivity and long turnaround times. This study assessed the performance of the BioFire FilmArray Pneumonia Panel (PN panel) and Pneumonia Plus Panel (PNplus panel), an FDA-cleared sample-to-answer assay that enables the detection of viruses, atypical bacteria, bacteria, and antimicrobial resistance marker genes from lower respiratory tract specimens (sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage [BAL] fluid). Semiquantitative results are also provided for the bacterial targets. This paper describes selected analytical and clinical studies that were conducted to evaluate performance of the panel for regulatory clearance. Prospectively collected respiratory specimens (846 BAL and 836 sputum specimens) evaluated with the PN panel were also tested by quantitative reference culture and molecular methods for comparison. The PN panel showed a sensitivity of 100% for 15/22 etiologic targets using BAL specimens and for 10/24 using sputum specimens. All other targets had sensitivities of ≥75% or were unable to be calculated due to low prevalence in the study population. Specificity for all targets was ≥87.2%, with many false-positive results compared to culture that were confirmed by alternative molecular methods. Appropriate adoption of this test could provide actionable diagnostic information that is anticipated to impact patient care and antimicrobial stewardship decisions.","Murphy, Caitlin N.; Fowler, Randal; Balada-Llasat, Joan Miquel; Carroll, Amanda; Stone, Hanna; Akerele, Oluseun; Buchan, Blake; Windham, Sam; Hopp, Amanda; Ronen, Shira; Relich, Ryan F.; Buckner, Rebecca; Warren, Del A.; Humphries, Romney; Campeau, Shelly; Huse, Holly; Chandrasekaran, Suki; Leber, Amy; Everhart, Kathy; Harrington, Amanda; Kwong, Christina; Bonwit, Andrew; Dien Bard, Jennifer; Naccache, Samia; Zimmerman, Cynthia; Jones, Barbara; Rindlisbacher, Cory; Buccambuso, Maggie; Clark, Angela; Rogatcheva, Margarita; Graue, Corrin; Bourzac, Kevin M.",J Clin Microbiol,https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm.00128-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32350043/,259
631995,Challenges amid COVID-19 times - Review of the changing practices in a clinical chemistry laboratory from a developing country,2020-06-06,"The aim of this study was to decipher the molecular epidemiological and antigenic characteristics of infectious bronchitis virus strains (IBVs) isolated in recent years in southwestern China. A total of 24 field strains were isolated from diseased chickens between 2012 and 2016. Phylogenetic analysis based on S1 nucleotide sequences showed that 16 of the 24 isolates were clustered into four distinct genotypes: QX (37.5%), TW (16.7%, TWI and TWII), Mass (8.3%), and J2 (4.2%). The QX genotype was still the prevalent genotype in southwestern China. Recombination analysis of the S1 subunit gene showed that eight of the 24 field strains were recombinant variants that originated from field strains and vaccine strains. A new potential recombination hotspot [ATTTT(T/A)] was identified, implying that recombination events may become more and more common. The antigenicity of ten IBVs, including seven field strains and commonly used vaccine strains, were assayed with a viral cross-neutralization assay in chicken embryonated kidney cells (CEK). The results showed that the ten IBVs could be divided into four serotypes (Massachusetts, 793B, Sczy3, and SCYB). Sczy3 and 793B were the predominant serotypes. Six of the seven field isolates (all except for cK/CH/SCYB/140913) cross-reacted well with anti-sera against other field strains. In conclusion, the genetic and antigenic features of IBVs from southwestern China in recent years have changed when compared to the previous reports. The results could provide a reference for vaccine development and the prevention of infectious bronchitis in southwestern China.","Xia, Jing; He, Xiao; Yao, Ke-Chang; Du, Li-Jing; Liu, Ping; Yan, Qi-Gui; Wen, Yi-Ping; Cao, San-Jie; Han, Xin-Feng; Huang, Yong",Infect Genet Evol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134816303483; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567134816303483; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2016.08.011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27530216/,259

Their co-existence is, however, not proven to enhance the severity of anemia. CASE REPORT: We report the case of a young man with no known co-morbidities, who came with fever and cough and was diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia. He was found to have hemoglobin D thalassemia and G6PD deficiency during further evaluation. Hydroxychloroquine therapy started initially, was discontinued after 3 doses once the G6PD deficiency was diagnosed. His hospital course showed a mild drop in hemoglobin with evidence of hemolysis on peripheral smear. However, the hemoglobin improved without any need for transfusion. CONCLUSIONS: Hydroxychloroquine therapy can induce hemolytic crises in patients with underlying G6PD deficiency or hemoglobinopathies and should be avoided or closely monitored. Immediate intervention to stop hydroxychloroquine after 3 doses saved our patient from a major hemolytic crisis. The significance of this case report is that it is the first report that outlines the clinic course of COVID-19 pneumonia in a patient with underlying hemoglobin D disease and G6PD deficiency.","Sasi, Sreethish; Yassin, Mohamed A.; Nair, Arun Prabhakaran; Al Maslamani, Muna S.",Am J Case Rep,https://doi.org/10.12659/ajcr.925788; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32697769/,259

This study aims to understand how family caregivers’ mental health and caregiver burden affects physical health simultaneously, controlling for factors such as age, education level, caring hours per day, and emotional, functional, and physical support systems used by caregivers. We recruited 388 caregivers from Kaohsiung and Pingtong region in Taiwan. Caregivers had to be 18 years or older and spend most of their time taking care of an ill family member at home. Mental health was assessed by the 12-item Chinese Health Questionnaire (CHQ-12) and burden was measured using a modified scale for caregiver's burden. Health status was assessed by self-perceived health (SPH), illness symptoms and the number of diagnosed chronic diseases. A high number of hours per day of caregiving was associated with low emotional support and SPH, poor mental health and high burden. Higher emotional support was associated with better mental health and fewer illness symptoms. Higher physical support was associated with poorer mental health, higher burden, a greater number of illness symptoms and chronic diseases, and a lower SPH score. Hours per day of caregiving, and use of emotional, functional, and physical support were associated with mental health, and the hours per day of caregiving and use of physical support were predictors of burden. Mental health and burden were significantly associated with caregivers’ health problems simultaneously. Our results show the important influence of mental health on caregivers’ physical health.

An open problem is to address the release of antibodies after the infection and after getting the individuals vaccinated against the virus. The viral fusion process is linked with the furin enzyme and the adaptation is linked with the mutation, called D614G mutation. The cell-protein studies are extremely challenging. We have developed a mathematical model to address the process at the cell-protein level and the delay is linked with this biological process. Genetic algorithm is used to approximate the parametric values. The mathematical model proposed during this research consists of virus concentration, the infected cells count at different stages and the effect of interferon. To improve the understanding of this model of SARS-CoV2 infection process, the action of interferon (IFN) is quantified using a variable for the non-linear mathematical model, that is based on a degradation parameter [Formula: see text] . This parameter is responsible for the delay in the dynamics of this viral action. We emphasize that this delay responds to the evasion by SARS-CoV2 via antagonizing IFN production, inhibiting IFN signaling and improving viral IFN resistance.

Underreporting and undertreatment of pain is a common event in the general population but little is known about these issues in indigenous peoples. The aim of this study was to investigate the characteristics and cultural aspects of pain management in five ethnicities of the Brazilian Amazon. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cross-sectional study carried out with adult indigenous individuals from five ethnicities of the Brazilian Amazon over two scientific expeditions (June–July/2017 and February–March/2019). Pain assessment included etiology, intensity, duration, aggravating and alleviating factors, body location, impact of pain on activities of daily living, and treatment. RESULTS: Ninety indigenous individuals with a mean age of 41.42 ± 19.59 years (range 19‒98 years) and median age of 37 years participated in the study. Sixty-four individuals (71.1%) reported experiencing pain at the time of interview with intermittent musculoskeletal pain of strong intensity being the more prevalent (back pain: 45.3%, joint pain: 43.7%) followed by headache (26.5%). The main alleviating factors reported were traditional indigenous medicine (21.0%) and rest (30.0%), and physical exertion was the main aggravating factor (69.0%). Most study participants reported that pain affected their mood, activities of daily living, and sleep and that they used both traditional indigenous medicine (78.0%) and conventional medicine (81.0%) for pain relief. CONCLUSION: Musculoskeletal pain is prevalent among indigenous individuals, affects their quality of life, and is partly attributed to their lifestyle. Cultural aspects mediating the pain experience were observed. Traditional indigenous medicine for pain relief remains partially preserved among the ethnic groups investigated. The findings of this study can help improve the delivery care to these vulnerable populations.","Barbosa de Moraes, Elaine; Dal Fabbro, Daniela Reis; Bernardes de Oliveira, Leticia; Ribeiro Leão, Eliseth",J Pain Res,https://doi.org/10.2147/jpr.s298219; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34234543/,259

The protease furin is also involved in mediating SARS‐CoV‐2 and other viral infections, although its association with early IFN response has not been evaluated yet. In order to assess the in vivo relationship between ACE2 and furin expression and the IFN response in nasopharyngeal cells, we first examined ACE2 and furin levels and their correlation with the well-known marker of IFNs’ activation, ISG15, in children (n=59) and adults (n=48), during respiratory diseases not caused by SARS-CoV-2. A strong positive correlation was found between ACE2 concentration, but not of furin, and ISG15 in all patients analyzed. In addition, type I and III IFN stimulation experiments were performed to examine the IFN-mediated activation of ACE2 isoforms (full-length and truncated) and furin in epithelial cell lines. Following all the IFNs treatments, only the truncated ACE2 levels, were upregulated significantly in the A549 and Calu3 cells, in particular by type I IFNs. If confirmed in vivo following IFNs’ activation, the induction of the truncated ACE2 isoform only would not enhance the risk of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in the respiratory tract.","Scagnolari, Carolina; Bitossi, Camilla; Viscido, Agnese; Frasca, Federica; Oliveto, Giuseppe; Scordio, Mirko; Petrarca, Laura; Mancino, Enrica; Nenna, Raffaella; Riva, Elisabetta; De Vito, Corrado; Midulla, Fabio; Antonelli, Guido; Pierangeli, Alessandra",Cytokine,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1043466621000107; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cyto.2021.155430; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043466621000107?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33508651/,259

Scotophilus bat CoV-512 demonstrates potential for cross-species transmission because its viral RNA and specific antibodies have been detected in three bat species of Taiwan. Understanding the cell tropism of Scotophilus bat CoV-512 is the first step for studying the mechanism of cross-species transmission. In this study, a lentivirus-based pseudovirus was produced using the spike (S) protein of Scotophilus bat CoV-512 or SARS-CoV as a surface protein to test the interaction between coronaviral S protein and its cell receptor on 11 different cells. Susceptible cells expressed red fluorescence protein (RFP) after the entry of RFP-bound green fluorescence protein (GFP)-fused S protein of Scotophilus bat CoV-512 (RFP-Sco-S-eGFP) or RFP-SARS-S pseudovirus, and firefly luciferase (FLuc) activity expressed by cells infected with FLuc-Sco-S-eGFP or FLuc-SARS-S pseudovirus was quantified.

635575,Habits Heart App for Patient Engagement in Heart Failure Management: Pilot Feasibility Randomized Trial,2021-01-20,"BACKGROUND: While recent reports suggest that people with disabilities (PwDs) are likely to be adversely impacted by COVID-19 and face multiple challenges, previous research has not examined if COVID-19 burdens are unequally distributed with respect to the disability characteristics of the U.S. population. OBJECTIVE: This article presents the first national scale study of the relationship between COVID-19 incidence and disability characteristics in the U.S. The objective is to determine whether COVID-19 incidence is significantly greater in counties containing higher percentages of socio-demographically disadvantaged PwDs, based on race, ethnicity, poverty status, age, and biological sex. METHODS: This study integrates county-level data on confirmed COVID-19 cases from the Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering database with multiple disability variables from the 2018 American Community Survey. Statistical analyses are based on bivariate correlations and multivariate generalized estimating equations that consider spatial clustering in the data. RESULTS: Greater COVID-19 incidence rate is significantly associated with: (1) higher percentages of PwDs who are Black, Asian, Hispanic, Native American, below poverty, under 18 years of age, and female; and (2) lower percentages of PwDs who are non-Hispanic White, above poverty, aged 65 or more years, and male, after controlling for spatial clustering. CONCLUSIONS: Socio-demographically disadvantaged PwDs are significantly overrepresented in counties with higher COVID-19 incidence compared to other PwDs. These findings represent an important starting point for more detailed investigation of the disproportionate impacts of COVID-19 on PwDs and highlight the urgent need for COVID-19 data collection systems to incorporate disability information.","Chakraborty, Jayajit",Disabil Health J,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1936657420301394?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dhjo.2020.101007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32981853/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1936657420301394,259
636143,A scoping review of the impact of long-distance truck drivers on the spread of COVID-19 infection,2021-01-12,"BACKGROUND: Viral haemorrhagic fevers are characterized by irregular outbreaks with high mortality rate. Difficulties arise when implementing therapeutic trials in this context. The outbreak duration is hard to predict and can be short compared to delays of trial launch and number of subject needed (NSN) recruitment. Our objectives were to compare, using clinical trial simulation, different trial designs for experimental treatment evaluation in various outbreak scenarios. METHODS: Four type of designs were compared: fixed or group-sequential, each being single- or two-arm. The primary outcome was 14-day survival rate. For single-arm designs, results were compared to a pre-trial historical survival rate p(H). Treatments efficacy was evaluated by one-sided tests of proportion (fixed designs) and Whitehead triangular tests (group-sequential designs) with type-I-error = 0.025. Both survival rates in the control arm p(C) and survival rate differences Δ (including 0) varied. Three specific cases were considered: “standard” (fixed p(C), reaching NSN for fixed designs and maximum sample size N(Max) for group-sequential designs); “changing with time” (increased p(C) over time); “stopping of recruitment” (epidemic ends). We calculated the proportion of simulated trials showing treatment efficacy, with K = 93,639 simulated trials to get a type-I-error PI(95%) of [0.024;0.026]. RESULTS: Under H(0) (Δ = 0), for the “standard” case, the type-I-error was maintained regardless of trial designs. For “changing with time” case, when p(C) > p(H,) type-I-error was inflated, and when p(C) < p(H) it decreased. Wrong conclusions were more often observed for single-arm designs due to an increase of Δ over time. Under H(1) (Δ = + 0.2), for the “standard” case, the power was similar between single- and two-arm designs when p(C) = p(H). For “stopping of recruitment” case, single-arm performed better than two-arm designs, and fixed designs reported higher power than group-sequential designs. A web R-Shiny application was developed. CONCLUSIONS: At an outbreak beginning, group-sequential two-arm trials should be preferred, as the infected cases number increases allowing to conduct a strong randomized control trial. Group-sequential designs allow early termination of trials in cases of harmful experimental treatment. After the epidemic peak, fixed single-arm design should be preferred, as the cases number decreases but this assumes a high level of confidence on the pre-trial historical survival rate.

636561,Correlations Between COVID-19 Cases and Google Trends Data in the United States: A State by State Analysis,2020-08-20,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted human societies around the world. This public health emergency was followed by a significant loss of human life; the ensuing social restrictions led to loss of employment, lack of interactions, and burgeoning psychological distress. As physical distancing regulations were introduced to manage outbreaks, individuals, groups, and communities engaged extensively on social media to express their thoughts and emotions. This internet-mediated communication of self-reported information encapsulates the emotional health and mental well-being of all individuals impacted by the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: This research aims to investigate the human emotions related to the COVID-19 pandemic expressed on social media over time, using an artificial intelligence (AI) framework. METHODS: Our study explores emotion classifications, intensities, transitions, and profiles, as well as alignment to key themes and topics, across the four stages of the pandemic: declaration of a global health crisis (ie, prepandemic), the first lockdown, easing of restrictions, and the second lockdown. This study employs an AI framework comprised of natural language processing, word embeddings, Markov models, and the growing self-organizing map algorithm, which are collectively used to investigate social media conversations. The investigation was carried out using 73,000 public Twitter conversations posted by users in Australia from January to September 2020. RESULTS: The outcomes of this study enabled us to analyze and visualize different emotions and related concerns that were expressed and reflected on social media during the COVID-19 pandemic, which could be used to gain insights into citizens’ mental health. First, the topic analysis showed the diverse as well as common concerns people had expressed during the four stages of the pandemic. It was noted that personal-level concerns expressed on social media had escalated to broader concerns over time. Second, the emotion intensity and emotion state transitions showed that fear and sadness emotions were more prominently expressed at first; however, emotions transitioned into anger and disgust over time. Negative emotions, except for sadness, were significantly higher (P<.05) in the second lockdown, showing increased frustration. Temporal emotion analysis was conducted by modeling the emotion state changes across the four stages of the pandemic, which demonstrated how different emotions emerged and shifted over time. Third, the concerns expressed by social media users were categorized into profiles, where differences could be seen between the first and second lockdown profiles. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that the diverse emotions and concerns that were expressed and recorded on social media during the COVID-19 pandemic reflected the mental health of the general public. While this study established the use of social media to discover informed insights during a time when physical communication was impossible, the outcomes could also contribute toward postpandemic recovery and understanding psychological impact via emotion changes, and they could potentially inform health care decision making. This study exploited AI and social media to enhance our understanding of human behaviors in global emergencies, which could lead to improved planning and policy making for future crises.","Adikari, Achini; Nawaratne, Rashmika; De Silva, Daswin; Ranasinghe, Sajani; Alahakoon, Oshadi; Alahakoon, Damminda",J Med Internet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33819167/; https://doi.org/10.2196/27341,259

637554,A call for Essays: stories from the frontline during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020-10-16,"Air pollution exposure is a leading public health problem in China. The majority of the total air pollution disease burden is from fine particulate matter (PM(2.5)) exposure, with smaller contributions from ozone (O(3)) exposure. Recent emission reductions have reduced PM(2.5) exposure. However, levels of exposure and the associated risk remain high, some pollutant emissions have increased, and some sectors lack effective emission control measures. We quantified the potential impacts of relevant policy scenarios on ambient air quality and public health across China. We show that PM(2.5) exposure inside the Greater Bay Area (GBA) is strongly controlled by emissions outside the GBA. We find that reductions in residential solid fuel use and agricultural fertilizer emissions result in the greatest reductions in PM(2.5) exposure and the largest health benefits. A 50% transition from residential solid fuel use to liquefied petroleum gas outside the GBA reduced PM(2.5) exposure by 15% in China and 3% within the GBA, and avoided 191,400 premature deaths each year across China. Reducing agricultural fertilizer emissions of ammonia by 30% outside the GBA reduced PM(2.5) exposure by 4% in China and 3% in the GBA, avoiding 56,500 annual premature deaths across China. Our simulations suggest that reducing residential solid fuel or industrial emissions will reduce both PM(2.5) and O(3) exposure, whereas other policies may increase O(3) exposure. Improving particulate air quality inside the GBA will require consideration of residential solid fuel and agricultural sectors, which currently lack targeted policies, and regional cooperation both inside and outside the GBA.","Conibear, Luke; Reddington, Carly L.; Silver, Ben J.; Knote, Christoph; Arnold, Stephen R.; Spracklen, Dominick V.",Geohealth,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33898905/; https://doi.org/10.1029/2020gh000341,259

Generalizable seasonal patterns of respiratory virus transmission may estimate the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 or other emerging pathogens. OBJECTIVE: To describe the annual and biennial variation in respiratory virus seasonality in a northern climate. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study is an epidemiological assessment using population-based surveillance of patients with medically attended respiratory tract infection from 2005 through 2017 in Alberta, Canada. Incident cases of respiratory virus infection and infant respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) hospitalizations in Alberta were extracted from the Data Integration for Alberta Laboratories platform and Alberta Health Services Discharge Abstract Database, respectively. A deterministic susceptible-infected-recovered-susceptible mathematical model with seasonal forcing function was fitted to the data for each virus. The possible future seasonal course of SARS-CoV-2 in northern latitudes was modeled on the basis of these observations. The analysis was conducted between December 15, 2020, and February 10, 2021. EXPOSURES: Seasonal respiratory pathogens. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Incidence (temporal pattern) of respiratory virus infections and RSV hospitalizations. RESULTS: A total of 37 719 incident infections with RSV, human metapneumovirus, or human coronaviruses 229E, NL63, OC43, or HKU1 among 35 375 patients (18 069 [51.1%] male; median [interquartile range], 1.29 [0.42-12.2] years) were documented. A susceptible-infected-recovered-susceptible model mirrored the epidemiological data, including a striking biennial variation with alternating severe and mild winter peaks. Qualitative description of the model and numerical simulations showed that strong seasonal contact rate and temporary immunity lasting 6 to 12 months were sufficient to explain biennial seasonality in these various respiratory viruses. The seasonality of 10 212 hospitalizations among children younger than 5 years with RSV was also explored. The median (interquartile range) rate of hospitalizations per 1000 live births was 18.6 (17.6-19.9) and 11.0 (10.4-11.7) in alternating even (severe) and odd (less-severe) seasons, respectively (P = .001). The hazard of admission was higher for children born in severe (even) seasons compared with those born in less-severe (odd) seasons (hazard ratio, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.61-1.75; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this modeling study of respiratory viruses in Alberta, Canada, the seasonality followed a pattern estimated by simple mathematical models, which may be informative for anticipating future waves of pandemic SARS-CoV-2.","Hawkes, Michael T.; Lee, Bonita E.; Kanji, Jamil N.; Zelyas, Nathan; Wong, Kerry; Barton, Michelle; Mukhi, Shamir; Robinson, Joan L.",JAMA Netw Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34529066/; https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.24650,259

The objective of this scoping review is to identify impacts of restricted visitation policies in acute care settings, and describe perspectives and mitigation approaches among patients, families, and healthcare professionals. METHODS: We searched Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, Healthstar, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials on January 01/2021, unrestricted, for published primary research records reporting any study design. We included secondary (e.g., reviews) and non-research records (e.g., commentaries), and performed manual searches in web-based resources. We excluded records that did not report primary data. Two reviewers independently abstracted data in duplicate. RESULTS: Of 7810 citations, we included 155 records. Sixty-six records (43%) were primary research; 29 (44%) case reports or case series, and 26 (39%) cohort studies; 21 (14%) were literature reviews and 8 (5%) were expert recommendations; 54 (35%) were commentary, editorial, or opinion pieces. Restricted visitation policies impacted coping and daily function (n = 31, 20%) and mental health outcomes (n = 29, 19%) of patients, families, and healthcare professionals. Participants described a need for coping and support (n = 107, 69%), connection and communication (n = 107, 69%), and awareness of state of well-being (n = 101, 65%). Eighty-seven approaches to mitigate impact of restricted visitation were identified, targeting families (n = 61, 70%), patients (n = 51, 59%), and healthcare professionals (n = 40, 46%).

OBJECTIVE: To help identify areas of opportunity for protecting dentists and their patients, the aim of this investigation was to analyze dentists’ early perceptions of their risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2, and their need for comprehensive infection control education in Mexico. METHODS: This cross-sectional survey was conducted from May 9 to June 3, 2020 during the social distancing phase in Mexico. The survey adhered to relevant guidelines for ethical research design. The questionnaire was designed with Google Surveys and applied online in Spanish. The questionnaire included items on demographics and clinical specialization. To obtain time-sensitive perceptions, statements were preceded by “While SARS-CoV-2 circulates in the community and new COVID-19 cases are reported”; responses were collected in a five-point Likert-type scale. RESULTS: The survey's link received 1,524 “clicks.” Over 25 days, 996 dentists participated (39% males, 89% working in Mexico and 11% in other Spanish-speaking Latin American countries). Most participants (73%) fully agreed that “Looking after patients will pose a risk for the dentist.” Total agreement was more common (P=0.0001) among dentists in Mexico (76%) than among those in other countries (53%). Knowing someone with COVID-19 was more common among Mexican dentists (P=0.0008). The perceived need for enhanced infection control procedures increased with age (P=0.0001). Forty-nine percent totally agreed that they sterilize dental handpieces between patients. One-third expressed total agreement that everyone in their clinic was trained in infection control. Conclusions. Among this non-probabilistic self-selected sample of dentists, age and country of work influenced their perceptions about occupational exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and infection control needs.

641738,"Hypocalcemia in COVID-19: Prevalence, clinical significance and therapeutic implications",2021-04-13,"Background: In clinical practice, cardiac computed tomography (CCT) has a limited role in acute coronary syndromes (ACS). Several trials evaluated CCT in low and intermediate risk patients presenting to the emergency room (ER) and noted that it was both safe and feasible. During the COVID19 pandemic, it is imperative to adopt a pathway for the evaluation of ACS that permits early discharge, reduces invasive coronary angiography and limits exposure of healthcare workers. Here, we present a single center experience by which CCT was incorporated in the clinical pathway of patients presenting to the ER with chest pain and ACS. Methods: This is a snapshot study of the first 27 patients who underwent CCT immediately after the lockdown in the city of Jeddah. ST elevation myocardial infarctions and hemodynamically unstable patients were excluded. Those with unstable angina or a Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction were screened for COVID19. The patients' COVID19 status and the results of the CCT were then used to determine the treatment strategy. Patient predisposition, hospital stay and exposure of staff are collected and reported. Results: All CCT images were interpretable with no limitations or significant artifact. CCT identified critical disease in 7 patients (26%), normal epicardial coronary arteries in 11 (41%) and mild to moderate disease in 9 (33%). All patients with normal or mild to moderate disease were assigned to a conservative strategy and discharged within 24 h. Those with a NSTEMI and critical anatomy were assigned to an additional invasive evaluation with subsequent revascularization. During the course of this study, no transmission to healthcare workers occurred. Conclusion: CCT enabled 80% of patients to be discharged within the first 24 h, the majority of whom were discharged from the emergency room. It was able to identify critical anatomy facilitating appropriate revascularization. This snapshot study warrants exploration of the role of CCT in ACS further particularly since the latest European Society of Cardiology's Non-STEACS guidelines suggest a role for CCT in the evaluation of low risk ACS.","Alasnag, Mirvat; Ahmed, Waqar; Al-Nasser, Ibrahim; Al-Shaibi, Khaled",Front Cardiovasc Med,https://doi.org/10.3389/fcvm.2021.665735; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34046439/,259
641890,Respiratory and Psychophysical Sequelae Among Patients With COVID-19 Four Months After Hospital Discharge,2021-01-27,"CONTEXT: The emergence of COVID-19/SARS-CoV2 (COVID-19) was an outbreak that began in December 2019 and rose to pandemic levels in 2020. One of the largest problems with COVID-19 is the typical delay in testing and diagnosis that can lead to additional transmission of the disease. Under consultation with a board-certified radiologist, the study team evaluated the common radiological findings of COVID-19 on computed tomography (CT) and compared the efficacy of chest radiographs (i.e., x-rays) to CT in diagnosing COVID-19. METHODS: In 2020, the authors completed a retrospective review of radiologic imaging data (i.e., the original imaging report notes) from Italy performed on 47 patients who had tested positive for COVID-19 in Italy during the national outbreak from February to March 2020. Radiologic images were obtained from Società Italiana di Radiologia Medica e Interventistica radiological database of COVID-19 patients. Each case was analyzed for whether they had positive findings on either chest radiograph or CT or both among patients who had positive COVID-19 test results. RESULTS: The authors found significant radiological finding similarities among the 47 COVID-19 positive case studies from Italy during the February to March 2020 time period. Ground glass opacities and crazy paving were the most significant findings, resembling the findings in China and other Coronavirus strains. The authors’ statistical analyses indicated that CT scans were more reliable by 30.7% than chest radiographs in identifying signs of COVID-19. In cases where either an initial negative swab for COVID-19 or providers lacked patient social histories, chest radiographs were used to show clinical findings consistent with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Based on these results, chest radiographs appear to be a consistent method to assist in the diagnosis of most COVID-19 cases. The authors discuss several scenarios in community-based and non-hospital US settings for COVID-19 diagnostic processes.","Brennan, Zachary; Guerra, Samantha; Seman, Susan",Spartan medical research journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33655187/,259

METHODS: Using the Taiwan’s Longitudinal Health Insurance Database (2005), we identified 147,157 patients received ACEIs and/or ARBs between 1997 and 2008. The annual incident and prevalent users of ACEIs, ARBs and overall renin-angiotensin drugs were examined. Box-Tiao intervention analysis was applied to assess the impact of price adjustments on monthly utilization of and expenditures on these drugs. ACEIs were divided into patented and off-patent drugs, off-patent ACEIs were further divided into original brands and generics, and subgroup analyses were performed. RESULTS: The number of incident renin-angiotensin drug users decreased over the study period. The number of prevalent ARB users increased and exceeded the cumulative number of first-time renin-angiotensin drug users starting on ARBs, implying that some patients switched from ACEIs to ARBs. After price adjustments, long term trend increases in utilization were observed for patented ACEIs and ARBs; a long-term trend decrease was observed for off-patent ACEIs; long-term trend change was not significant for overall renin-angiotensin drugs. Significant long-term trend increases in expenditures were observed for patented ACEIs after price adjustment in 2007 (200.9%, p = 0.0088) and in ARBs after price adjustments in 2001 (173.4%, p < 0.0001) and 2007 (146.3%, p < 0.0001). A significant long-term trend decrease in expenditures was observed for off-patent ACEIs after 2004 price adjustment (−156.9%, p < 0.0001). Expenditures on overall renin-angiotensin drugs showed long-term trend increases after price adjustments in 2001 (72.2%, p < 0.0001) and 2007 (133.4%, p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Price adjustments did not achieve long-term cost savings for overall renin-angiotensin drugs. Possible switching from ACEIs to ARBs within individuals is evident. Policy makers should reconsider the appropriateness of the current adjustment strategies applied to patented and off-patent drugs.","Huang, Shiou-Huei; Hsu, Chien-Ning; Yu, Shu-Hui; Cham, Thau-Ming",BMC Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22521158/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2458-12-288,259
643211,"Cardiovascular comorbidities, cardiac injury and prognosis of COVID-19 in New York City",2020-05-15,"Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), one of the causes for epidemic encephalitis, belongs to the family of Flaviviridae. In this study, we demonstrated that cellular DEAD-box RNA helicase DDX5 plays an important role in JEV replication. The knockdown of DDX5 was able to decrease JEV replication, and overexpression of DDX5 mutants lacking the helicase activity also reduced JEV replication, suggesting the helicase activity is essential for JEV replication. DDX5 knockdown did not affect virus assembly and release. GST-pulldown and co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that DDX5 could interact with JEV core protein, non-structural protein 3 (NS3) and 5 (NS5-MTase and NS5-RdRp domains). Meanwhile, we also confirmed that DDX5 interacts with these viral proteins during JEV infection. Confocal microscopy analysis showed that endogenous DDX5 is recruited to the cytoplasm and colocalizes with these viral proteins and viral RNA. RNA-pulldown experiment showed that DDX5 only binds to the JEV 3′ untranslated region (UTR). Finally, we confirmed the role of DDX5 in JEV RNA replication using JEV-replicon system. In conclusion, we identified DDX5 as a positive regulator for JEV replication.","Li, Chen; Ge, Ling-ling; Li, Peng-peng; Wang, Yue; Sun, Ming-xia; Huang, Li; Ishag, Hassan; Di, Dong-dong; Shen, Zhi-qiang; Fan, Wei-xing; Mao, Xiang",Antiviral Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24035833/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354213002477; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354213002477; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2013.09.002,259

We conducted in-depth interviews with 15-17 year olds in rural Alabama (N=28). About 54% of our sample were female. Nearly a third lived with an older family member; 18% knew someone who contracted COVID-19. Using Rapid Qualitative Analysis, three COVID-19 vaccine-related themes emerged: influence of community leaders and older family members, fear of side effects and mis-information, and institutional distrust. To address COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among rural African American or Black adolescents, we suggest adopting a socioecological approach to public health messaging that addressed mis-information and government distrust, and is delivered by local influencers with the social capital necessary to promote behavior change, namely older family members and Church officials.","Budhwani, Henna; Maycock, Tiffani; Murrell, Wilnadia; Simpson, Tina",J Adolesc Health,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1054139X21004547?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1054139X21004547; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2021.09.010,259

COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) is a potential therapeutic, but there is limited data for patients with moderate-to-severe disease. RESEARCH QUESTION: What are outcomes associated with administration of CCP in patients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19 infection? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a propensity score-matched analysis of patients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19. The primary endpoints were in-hospital mortality. Secondary endpoints were number of days alive and ventilator-free at 30 days; length of hospital stay; and change in WHO scores from CCP administration (or index date) to discharge. Of 151 patients who received CCP, 132 had complete follow-up data. Patients were transfused after a median of 6 hospital days; thus, we investigated the effect of convalescent plasma before and after this timepoint with 77 early (within 6 days) and 55 late (after 6 days) recipients. Among 3,217 inpatients who did not receive CCP, 2,551 were available for matching. RESULTS: Early CCP recipients, of whom 31 (40%) were on mechanical ventilation, had lower 14-day (15% vs 23%) and 30-day (38% vs 49%) mortality compared to a matched unexposed cohort, with nearly 50% lower likelihood of in-hospital mortality (HR 0.52, [95% CI 0.28–0.96]; P = 0.036). Early plasma recipients had more days alive and ventilator-free at 30 days (+3.3 days, [95% CI 0.2 to 6.3 days]; P = 0.04) and improved WHO scores at 7 days (-0.8, [95% CI: -1.2 to -0.4]; P = 0.0003) and hospital discharge (-0.9, [95% CI: -1.5 to -0.3]; P = 0.004) compared to the matched unexposed cohort. No clinical differences were observed in late plasma recipients. INTERPRETATION: Early administration of CCP improves outcomes in patients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19, while improvement was not observed with late CCP administration. The importance of timing of administration should be addressed in specifically designed trials.","Briggs, Neima; Gormally, Michael V.; Li, Fangyong; Browning, Sabrina L.; Treggiari, Miriam M.; Morrison, Alyssa; Laurent-Rolle, Maudry; Deng, Yanhong; Hendrickson, Jeanne E.; Tormey, Christopher A.; Desruisseaux, Mahalia S.",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0254453; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34320004/,259

METHOD: We collected and analyzed all the epidemiologic and virological diagnostic details of the infected individuals released by public health authorities and reiterated every episode of outbreak on a timeline. All individuals associated with the five outbreaks had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: In this study, all five COVID-19 outbreaks reported in China since October 2020 were analyzed. The Kashgar outbreak in Xinjiang province came into light for the first time on October 22, 2020. However, it was initiated before October 11, 2020, by a local asymptomatic import and export worker, who was infected at the working place. Subsequently, his wife caught the infection, which led to 430 more infections reported in the outbreak. The Beijing outbreak with 41 cases was noticed for the first time on December 22, 2020. However, our analysis revealed that it was initiated by an asymptomatic individual from Indonesia on December 10, 2020. The Shenyang outbreak, with 38 cases, noticed for the first time on December 23, 2020, was initiated by a pre-symptomatic individual from South Korea on December 13, 2020. CONCLUSION: The asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic individuals during the asymptomatic period were unsuspectingly infected by SARS-CoV-2, and unintentionally transmitted the virus to a large number of people. These findings suggest that early detection of asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic individuals is of critical importance in preventing future outbreaks or epidemics.","Yang, Caixin; Zhang, Sihui; Lu, Shan; Yang, Jing; Cheng, Yanpeng; Liu, Yue; Zhao, Lijun; Gong, Jian; Xu, Jianguo",J Biosaf Biosecur,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S258893382100008X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jobb.2021.04.001; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S258893382100008X?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34060545/,259

Utilizing the YSD technique, antigens specific to the target antibody are displayed on the surface of engineered yeast cells with intracellular fluorescent proteins. The displayed antigens are then used for the detection of the target antibody, with the yeast cells as fluorescent labels. Multiplex immunoassay can be readily realized by using yeast cells expressing different intracellular fluorescent proteins to display different antigens. The implementation of this YSD-based immunoassay on the microfluidic platform eliminates the need for the bulky, complex and expensive flow cytometer. To improve the detection sensitivity and to eliminate the need for pumping, a functionalized micro pillar array (MPA) is incorporated in the microfluidic chip, resulting in a detection limit of 5 ng/mL (or 1 ng in terms of amount) and enhanced compatibility with practical applications such as clinical biopsy. This new platform has a high potential to be integrated into microfluidic detection systems to enable portable diagnostics in the future.","Wang, Jing; Cheng, Danhui; Chan, Jay Kwok-Lun; Luo, Xiaoteng; Wu, Hongkai; Hsing, I-Ming",Sens Actuators B Chem,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925400512001815; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.snb.2012.02.048; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288242/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0925400512001815,259

Rapidly, global organizations, US associations, and professionals stepped in to mitigate the virus's spread in buildings' living and work environments. The institutions proposed new air system HVAC settings without efficiency concerns, such as improved flow rates and filtering for irradiation, humidity, and temperature. Current literature consensually predicted an increase in energy consumption due to new measures to control the SARS-CoV-2 spread. The research team assumed the effort of validating the prior published outcomes, applied to US standardized high-rise office buildings, as defined and set by the key entities in the field, by resorting to a methodology based on software energy analysis. The study compares a standard high-rise office building energy consumption, and CO2 emissions and operations costs in nine US climate zones — from 0 to 8, south to north latitudes, respectively —, assessed in specifically the most populated cities, between the previous and post COVID-19 scenarios.

As a guideline, government issued directives on physical distancing and the use of face masks to curb community spread of the disease. Given that public transport has been identified as a high-risk environment for transmission, it was of interest to ascertain user and operator compliance to guidelines for public transport operations during the period, as a measure of its risk level. A roadside observer survey, of over 850 of the most popular paratransit (trotro) buses was carried out on one of the major roads in Kumasi. Compliance to the policy on physical distancing was determined using guidelines from the Ministry of Transport, while compliance to the policy on face masks was determined by the researchers themselves based on the number of commuters with/without face masks per bus. The results suggest that majority (98.0%) of buses comply with the social distancing guidelines established by the Ministry of transport, however the policy on face masks was complied with only partially in most vehicles. About 12.6% of the vehicles had fewer than three commuters without face masks, while 21.3% of buses that had fewer than 3 people with face masks. The results suggest public transport remains an area of high risk in the fight against COVID-19. It is recommended that operators are given additional directives that restrict them from allowing commuters without face masks on board their vehicles, and as well, that police enforce the policy through fines.","Junior, Emmanuel Komla Dzisi; Dei, Oscar Akunor",Transportation research interdisciplinary perspectives,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trip.2020.100191; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301020?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2590198220301020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34173465/,259
654863,Methanol toxicity outbreak: when fear of COVID-19 goes viral,2020-05-15,"INTRODUCTION: SARS-CoV-2 develops well in the oral mucosa because, it is the first contact area with the virus. The oral mucosa is highly expressed with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and makes the virus replicated in the epithelial cells and produce both oral lesions and oral symptoms. This review aimed to describe the oral mucosal symptoms and lesions related to SARS-CoV-2-infected patients that have been reported around the world. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A literature search was performed on PubMed, ScienceDirect and Google Scholar, from February to October 5, 2020, focusing on COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) oral lesions and oral symptoms. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Eighteen studies were identified with a total of 25 cases describing the oral symptoms and oral mucosal lesions of the SARS-CoV-2 infection. The oral symptoms related to the SARS-CoV-2 infection included dysgeusia, ageusia, a burning mouth sensation, a dry mouth and severe halitosis. The oral mucosal lesions varied from ulceration and depapilation to pseudomembranous, maculae, nodules and plaque. The mucosal lesions related to the skin lesions were in the form of crusty lips, multiple ulcerations and rashes, targeted lesions, blisters and vesiculobullous lesions. CONCLUSIONS: The manifestations of the SARS-CoV-2 infection in the oral cavity are non-specific. The oral mucosal lesions that occur mimic the Herpes zoster virus infection, the Herpes simplex virus infection, Varicella and hand, foot and mouth disease, and the oral mucosal lesions with the skin manifestations (e.g. erythema multiforme).","Surboyo, Meircurius D; Ernawati, Diah S; Budi, Hendrik S",Minerva Dent Oral Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34269548/; https://doi.org/10.23736/s2724-6329.21.04493-9,259

We aimed at discussing the various neurological manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection and to estimate the prevalence of each of them. METHODS: We searched the following electronic databases; PubMed, MEDLINE, Scopus, EMBASE, Google Scholar, EBSCO, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, WHO database, and ClinicalTrials.gov. Relevant MeSH terms for COVID-19 and neurological manifestations were used. Randomized controlled trials, non-randomized controlled trials, case-control studies, cohort studies, cross-sectional studies, case series, and case reports were included in the study. To estimate the overall proportion of each neurological manifestations, the study employed meta-analysis of proportions using a random-effects model. RESULTS: Pooled prevalence of each neurological manifestations are, smell disturbances (35.8%; 95% CI 21.4–50.2), taste disturbances (38.5%; 95%CI 24.0–53.0), myalgia (19.3%; 95% CI 15.1–23.6), headache (14.7%; 95% CI 10.4–18.9), dizziness (6.1%; 95% CI 3.1–9.2), and syncope (1.8%; 95% CI 0.9–4.6). Pooled prevalence of acute cerebrovascular disease was (2.3%; 95%CI 1.0–3.6), of which majority were ischaemic stroke (2.1%; 95% CI 0.9–3.3), followed by haemorrhagic stroke (0.4%; 95% CI 0.2–0.6), and cerebral venous thrombosis (0.3%; 95% CI 0.1–0.6). CONCLUSIONS: Neurological symptoms are common in SARS-CoV-2 infection, and from the large number of cases reported from all over the world daily, the prevalence of neurological features might increase again. Identifying some neurological manifestations like smell and taste disturbances can be used to screen patients with COVID-19 so that early identification and isolation is possible.","Favas, T.

This research aimed to determine the prevalence of RVA in ruminants (cattle, sheep, and goats) and investigate the circulating RVA genotypes in these animals in Kuwait. We conducted a cross-sectional study to detect RVA in ruminants, using an immunochromatography test (IC), direct sandwich ELISA test, and real-time RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) assay using fecal samples. RESULTS: A total of 400 cattle, 334 sheep, and 222 goats were examined. The prevalence of RVA was 5.3, 1.2, and 2.3%, respectively, using IC. The ELISA test detected RVA from 4.3% of cattle, 0.9% of sheep, and 1.8% of goats. There was a significant association between the occurrence of diarrhea and the presence of RVA in bovine fecal samples (p-value = 0.0022), while no statistical association between diarrhea and the presence of RVA in fecal samples of sheep and goats was observed (p-value = 0.7250; p-value = 0.4499, respectively). Twenty-three of the IC-positive samples (17 from cattle, two from sheep, and four from goats) were tested using a RT-qPCR RVA detection assay targeting the NSP3 gene. The results showed that 21 of 23 IC-positive samples tested positive by RT-qPCR. Detection of RVA genotypes revealed that G10P[11] was the predominant strain in cattle (58.8%), followed by G8P[1] (11.7%). One sheep sample was genotyped as G8P[1]. In addition, G6P[1] and G6P[14] were detected in goat samples. CONCLUSION: The present study revealed that the IC was more sensitive in detecting RVA antigen in fecal samples than the ELISA test. A higher occurrence of RVA infection was observed in cattle than in sheep and goats. This study suggests that RVA might be a risk factor of diarrhea in bovine calves less than 2 weeks old. This research also demonstrates the circulation of RVA in sheep and goat populations in Kuwait. Finally, the G10P[11] RVA genotype was the most prevalent genotype identified from cattle samples.

Two developments were crucial for the presented advances in our understanding of the cell biology of filoviruses, which is still fragmentary. On the one hand, the number of high containment laboratories increased where handling of the highly pathogenic filoviruses is possible. On the other hand, molecular biological tools have been developed that allow investigation of certain aspects of filoviral replication under normal laboratory conditions which considerably accelerated research on filoviruses. This review describes advances in understanding the interactions between host cells and filoviruses during viral attachment, entry, transcription, assembly and budding.","Dolnik, O.; Kolesnikova, L.; Becker, S.",Cell Mol Life Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18158582/,259
661475,Why is hyperglycemia worsening COVID‐19 and its prognosis?,2020-05-28,"Although Sasa quelpaertensis Nakai, a dwarf bamboo, is known to exert a variety of beneficial effects on health, its antiviral effect remains to be elucidated. Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is one of the most devastating viral pathogens of swine and has a substantial economic impact on the global pork industry. Therefore, the present study was conducted to determine whether Sasa quelpaertensis Nakai extract (SQE) inhibits PRRSV infection in cultured porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs). Our results demonstrated that SQE treatment suppressed the replication of PRRSV in a dose-dependent manner. The antiviral activity of SQE on PRRSV replication was found to be primarily exerted at early times postinfection. Treatment with SQE resulted in marked reduction of viral genomic and subgenomic RNA synthesis, viral protein expression, and progeny virus production. Notably, pro-inflammatory cytokine production in PAM cells infected with PRRSV was shown to be modulated in the presence of SQE. Taken together, our data indicate that SQE has potential as a therapeutic agent against PRRSV.

To that end, Bayesian Model Averaging techniques are used to analyze the relevance of the temperatures together with a set of additional climate, environmental, demographic, social and policy factors. The robustness of individual covariates is measured through posterior inclusion probabilities. The empirical analysis provides conclusive evidence on the role played by the temperatures given that it appears as the most relevant determinant of contagions. This finding is robust to (i) the prior distribution elicitation, (ii) the procedure to assign weights to the regressors, (iii) the presence of measurement errors in official data due to under-reporting, (iv) the employment of different metrics of temperatures or (v) the inclusion of additional correlates. In a second step, relative importance metrics that perform an accurate partitioning of the R2 of the model are calculated. The results of this approach support the evidence of the model averaging analysis, given that temperature is the top driver explaining 45% of regional contagion disparities. The set of policy-related factors appear in a second level of importance, whereas factors related to the degree of social connectedness or the demographic characteristics are less relevant.","Rios, V.; Gianmoena, L.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.13.20101261v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.13.20101261,259
662188,Vitamin D Status: Can It Affect the Risk of Infection and the Severity of COVID-19 Symptoms?,2021-03-31,"Background: Vaccine hesitancy has been recognized as a major global health threat by the World Health Organization. Many studies have investigated vaccine safety as a determinant for vaccine hesitancy; however, not much attention has been paid to vaccine production and quality control during the vaccine production process or whether knowledge about this topic may influence vaccine confidence. The aim of this study was to characterize the common knowledge about the vaccine production process. Methods: A freely accessible online questionnaire was developed on Google Modules and disseminated through social networks. A descriptive analysis of the collected answers was performed, and the chi-square test was used to assess significant differences for the sociodemographic characteristics of the study population (age, gender, work or education and training in the healthcare setting, minor offspring). A binary logistic regression model was performed considering these socio-demographic categories as independent variables. Results: The number of collected questionnaire was 135. Most of the participants (127/135, 94.1%) were aware that quality control measures are carried out during manufacturing, although some knowledge gaps emerged in specific aspects of the vaccine production process, without statistically significant differences between age groups. Working in the healthcare setting or being educated in healthcare may be considered predictors for a better understanding that more than 50% of the production time is spent on quality control (AOR = 3.43; 95% CI: 1.84–8.14, p = 0.01) and that considering quality control performed during the vaccine production process is adequate for avoiding contamination (AOR = 7.90; 95% CI: 0.97–64.34; p = 0.05). Conclusions: This study allowed for a characterization of common knowledge about the vaccine production process. It highlighted the need to implement specific strategies to spread correct information about the vaccine production process. This study may contribute to increased confidence and trust in vaccines and vaccination among the general population.","Bechini, Angela; Bonanni, Paolo; Zanella, Beatrice; Di Pisa, Giulia; Moscadelli, Andrea; Paoli, Sonia; Ancillotti, Leonardo; Bonito, Benedetta; Boccalini, Sara",Vaccines (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9060564; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34072288/,259

They may include several syndromes, such as a suggested autoimmune abnormal response, which may result in encephalitis and new-onset refractory status epilepticus (NORSE). Quickly recognizing such cases and starting the most appropriate therapy is mandatory due to the related rapid worsening and bad outcomes. This case series describes two adult patients admitted to the university hospital and positive to novel coronavirus 2019 (SARS-CoV-2) infection who developed drug-resistant status epilepticus. Both patients underwent early electroencephalography (EEG) assessment, which showed a pathological EEG pattern characterized by general slowing, rhythmic activity and continuous epileptic paroxysmal activity. A suspected autoimmune etiology, potentially triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection, encouraged a rapid work-up for a possible autoimmune encephalitis diagnosis. Therapeutic approach included the administration of 0.4 g/kg intravenous immunoglobulin, which resulted in a complete resolution of seizures after 5 and after 10 days, respectively, without adverse effects and followed by a normalization of the EEG patterns.","Manganotti, Paolo; Furlanis, Giovanni; Ajčević, Miloš; Moras, Cristina; Bonzi, Lucia; Pesavento, Valentina; Buoite Stella, Alex",J Neurol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33709220/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00415-021-10468-y,259

Policies put in place to curb the tide of the pandemic resulted in a decrease of patient volumes throughout the ambulatory system. The future implications of COVID-19 in healthcare are still unknown, specifically the continued impact on the ambulatory landscape. The primary objective of this study is to accurately forecast the number of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 weekly visits in primary care practices. Materials and Methods This retrospective study was conducted in a single health system in Delaware. All patients’ records were abstracted from our electronic health records system (EHR) from January 1, 2019 to July 25, 2020. Patient demographics and comorbidities were compared using t-tests, Chi square, and Mann Whitney U analyses as appropriate. ARIMA time series models were developed to provide an 8-week future forecast for two ambulatory practices (AmbP) and compare it to a naïve moving average approach. Results Among the 271,530 patients considered during this study period, 4,195 patients (1.5%) were identified as COVID-19 patients. The best fitting ARIMA models for the two AmbP are as follows: AmbP1 COVID-19+ ARIMAX(4,0,1), AmbP1 nonCOVID-19 ARIMA(2,0,1), AmbP2 COVID-19+ ARIMAX(1,1,1), and AmbP2 nonCOVID-19 ARIMA(1,0,0). Discussion and Conclusion: Accurately predicting future patient volumes in the ambulatory setting is essential for resource planning and developing safety guidelines. Our findings show that a time series model that accounts for the number of positive COVID-19 patients delivers better performance than a moving average approach for predicting weekly ambulatory patient volumes in a short-term period.","Li, Riza C.; Harrison, Cecelia K.; Jurkovitz, Claudine T.; Papas, Mia A.; Ndura, Kevin; Kerzner, Roger; Teal, Cydney; Chiam, Tze",Res Sq,https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-177379/v1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33688638/,259
664984,Chyawanprash for the prevention of COVID-19 infection among healthcare workers: A Randomized Controlled Trial,2021-02-19,"BACKGROUND: During a public health crisis such as the current COVID-19 pandemic, governments and health authorities need quick and accurate methods of communicating with the public. While social media can serve as a useful tool for effective communication during disease outbreaks, few studies have elucidated how these platforms are used by the Ministry of Health (MOH) during disease outbreaks in Saudi Arabia. OBJECTIVE: Guided by the Crisis and Emergency Risk Communication model, this study aimed to explore the MOH’s use of Twitter and the public’s engagement during different stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in Saudi Arabia. METHODS: Tweets and corresponding likes and retweets were extracted from the official Twitter account of the MOH in Saudi Arabia for the period of January 1 through August 31, 2020. Tweets related to COVID-19 were identified; subsequently, content analysis was performed, in which tweets were coded for the following message types: risk messages, warnings, preparations, uncertainty reduction, efficacy, reassurance, and digital health responses. Public engagement was measured by examining the numbers of likes and retweets. The association between outbreak stages and types of messages was assessed, as well as the effect of these messages on public engagement. RESULTS: The MOH posted a total of 1393 original tweets during the study period. Of the total tweets, 1293 (92.82%) were related to COVID-19, and 1217 were ultimately included in the analysis. The MOH posted the majority of its tweets (65.89%) during the initial stage of the outbreak. Accordingly, the public showed the highest level of engagement (as indicated by numbers of likes and retweets) during the initial stage. The types of messages sent by the MOH significantly differed across outbreak stages, with messages related to uncertainty reduction, reassurance, and efficacy being prevalent among all stages. Tweet content, media type, and crisis stage influenced the level of public engagement. Engagement was negatively associated with the inclusion of hyperlinks and multimedia files, while higher level of public engagement was associated with the use of hashtags. Tweets related to warnings, uncertainty reduction, and reassurance received high levels of public engagement. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides insights into the Saudi MOH’s communication strategy during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our results have implications for researchers, governments, health organizations, and practitioners with regard to their communication practices during outbreaks. To increase public engagement, governments and health authorities should consider the public’s need for information. This, in turn, could raise public awareness regarding disease outbreaks.","Alhassan, Fatimah Mohammed; AlDossary, Sharifah Abdullah",JMIR Public Health Surveill,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34117860/; https://doi.org/10.2196/27942,259

Despite having similar pathology to MERS and SARS-CoV, the infection fatality rate of SARS-CoV-2 is likely lower than 1%. SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to be uniquely characterized by the accessory protein ORF10, which contains eleven cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes of nine amino acids length each, across various human leukocyte antigen (HLA) subtypes. In this study, all missense mutations found in sequence databases were examined across twnety-two unique SARS-CoV-2 ORF10 variants that could possibly alter viral pathogenicity. Some of these mutations decrease the stability of ORF10, e.g. I4L and V6I were found in the MoRF region of ORF10 which may also possibly contribute to Intrinsic protein disorder. Furthermore, a physicochemical and structural comparative analysis was carried out on SARS-CoV-2 and Pangolin-CoV ORF10 proteins, which share 97.37% amino acid homology. The high degree of physicochemical and structural similarity of ORF10 proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and Pangolin-CoV open questions about the architecture of SARS-CoV-2 due to the disagreement of these two ORF10 proteins over their sub-structure (loop/coil region), solubility, antigenicity and change from the strand to coil at amino acid position 26, where tyrosine is present. Altogether, SARS-CoV-2 ORF10 is a promising pharmaceutical target and a protein which should be monitored for changes which correlate to change pathogenesis and clinical course of COVID-19 infection.","Hassan, Sk.

A high vigilance for the disease, frequent and regular temperature monitoring, early case identification and isolation of patients, as well as tracing and home quarantine of contacts, played major roles in controlling the outbreak. Hospitals were dedicated to the screening and treatment of SARS patients. Within and between hospitals, movement by healthcare workers, patients and visitors were restricted, as was the number of hospital visitors. Staff education and audits of infection control practices also featured prominently. To prevent cross-border transmission, incoming travellers from SARS affected areas had to complete health declaration cards. They, as well as all outgoing travellers from Singapore, were monitored for fever. In the meantime, the public was urged to refrain from travelling to SARS affected regions. Containment elements targeting the community included school closure, public education on good hygiene and readily accessible public information.

667727,Feasibility of a Randomized Controlled Trial of Paediatric Interdisciplinary Pain Management Using Home-Based Telehealth,2020-05-01,"Sialic acids (Sias) are important glycans displayed on the cells and tissues of many different animals and are frequent targets for binding and modification by pathogens, including influenza viruses. Influenza virus hemagglutinins bind Sias during the infection of their normal hosts, while the encoded neuraminidases and/or esterases remove or modify the Sia to allow virion release or to prevent rebinding. Sias naturally occur in a variety of modified forms, and modified Sias can alter influenza virus host tropisms through their altered interactions with the viral glycoproteins. However, the distribution of modified Sia forms and their effects on pathogen-host interactions are still poorly understood. Here we used probes developed from viral Sia-binding proteins to detect O-acetylated (4-O-acetyl, 9-O-acetyl, and 7,9-O-acetyl) Sias displayed on the tissues of some natural or experimental hosts for influenza viruses. These modified Sias showed highly variable displays between the hosts and tissues examined. The 9-O-acetyl (and 7,9-) modified Sia forms were found on cells and tissues of many hosts, including mice, humans, ferrets, guinea pigs, pigs, horses, dogs, as well as in those of ducks and embryonated chicken egg tissues and membranes, although in variable amounts. The 4-O-acetyl Sias were found in the respiratory tissues of fewer animals, being primarily displayed in the horse and guinea pig, but were not detected in humans or pigs. The results suggest that these Sia variants may influence virus tropisms by altering and selecting their cell interactions. IMPORTANCE Sialic acids (Sias) are key glycans that control or modulate many normal cell and tissue functions while also interacting with a variety of pathogens, including many different viruses. Sias are naturally displayed in a variety of different forms, with modifications at several positions that can alter their functional interactions with pathogens. In addition, Sias are often modified or removed by enzymes such as host or pathogen esterases or sialidases (neuraminidases), and Sia modifications can alter those enzymatic activities to impact pathogen infections. Sia chemical diversity in different hosts and tissues likely alters the pathogen-host interactions and influences the outcome of infection. Here we explored the display of 4-O-acetyl, 9-O-acetyl, and 7,9-O-acetyl modified Sia forms in some target tissues for influenza virus infection in mice, humans, birds, guinea pigs, ferrets, swine, horses, and dogs, which encompass many natural and laboratory hosts of those viruses.","Wasik, Brian R.; Barnard, Karen N.; Ossiboff, Robert J.; Khedri, Zahra; Feng, Kurtis H.; Yu, Hai; Chen, Xi; Perez, Daniel R.; Varki, Ajit; Parrish, Colin R.",mSphere,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28904995/; https://doi.org/10.1128/msphere.00379-16,259

Ltd, China) used in clinical diagnostics with the aim to establish if different swab designs and configurations had any effect on swab performance. Properties investigated included viral absorption, release, capture, extraction and recovery efficiency from each swab for the detection of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). All swab types (n=18) were inoculated with different amounts of SARS-CoV-2 live viral cultures (1:10, 1:100 and 1:1000 copies/ml) and eluted in sterile phosphate buffer saline. RNA was extracted from all swab eluates using a fully automated system (BD MAX System) and cycle threshold (Ct) values were compared. RNA stability was also investigated after dry storage of swabs at room temperature for 72 hours. Statistically significant differences (p<0.05) were observed in the absorption and release capabilities between Type 1 and 3 as well as between Type 2 and 3 swabs, however, no significant difference was observed between Type 1 and 2. Ct values and extraction efficiency amounts of SARS-CoV-2 varied amongst the swab types.

670888,149 Association of ACE-I and ARB Prescriptions With Mortality in Patients Admitted to the Hospital With COVID-19 in New York City,2020-10-31,"BACKGROUND: In Germany, family physicians care for about 85% of the patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. The geographic distribution of the first wave in 2020 was heterogeneous, and each federal state experienced different percentages of patients that died from COVID-19. Each of the 16 federal states implemented its own regulation about medical care for SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Against this background, the objective of this analysis was to gather experiences made by primary care physicians managing SARS-CoV-2 infected patients during the first wave in March 2020 and to clinically characterize these patients. METHODS: In total, 5,632 physicians were invited to participate in an online questionnaire surveying routine data regarding the general care situation at the physician practice level and the care for patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were applied to characterize treatment experiences and to identify patient characteristics predicting the course of disease. RESULTS: 132 family physicians from all German federal states (except from Berlin) participated in this analysis (response rate 2.3%) and provided routine care data for 1,085 patients. Information from 373 of these patients were provided in greater detail. On average, each physician treated 8.5 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. About 15% of the physicians used video consultations to communicate with their infected patients. More than 82% made positive experiences with the exceptional regulation to provide a certificate of incapacity to work by telephone. Half of the physicians faced equipment insufficiencies due to a lack of protective gear, and in 10% of the practices, the staff themselves acquired SARS-CoV-2 infection. Greater numbers of SARS-CoV-2 cases treated in a practice translated into higher odds for members of the practice to be infected (odds ratio (OR) 1.03, 95% CI [1.01;1.06]). Older persons, males and patients in rural areas had higher odds for a severe course of disease. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that a large percentage of primary care physicians additionally managed their COVID-19 patients remotely by telephone or video during the outbreak, while also being at a higher risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further, the increased severity in rural areas underlines the importance of strong primary health care in order to enable hospitals to concentrate on critically ill patients.","Strumann, Christoph; von Meißner, Wolfgang C.G.; Blickle, Paul-Georg; Held, Linda; Steinhäuser, Jost",Z Evid Fortbild Qual Gesundhwes,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.zefq.2021.07.005; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1865921721001227; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34474994/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1865921721001227,259

However, this new work pattern could also affect the well-being of workers. Therefore, the aim of the study was to study the magnitude of occupational health problems and lifestyle changes among workers who have only recently started working from home. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted using online self-administered questionnaires during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic in the Bangkok metropolitan area, Thailand. The participants were from any organization that allowed working from home. The demographic data including the analysis of the characteristics of working from home, the occurrence of occupational health problems, and the lifestyle changes caused by working from home were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 869 workers were included as study participants. The highest prevalence of physical health problems among all workers was identified to be weight gain at a rate of 40.97% (95% confidence interval = 37.69–44.24), and the highest prevalence of psychosocial problems was identified to be cabin fever at a rate of 31.28% (95% confidence interval = 26.66–35.90%) among full-time working-from-home workers. The health effects that were significantly related to the intensity of working from home (p for trends <0.05), either positively or negatively, included body weight changes, ergonomic problems, indoor environmental problems, and psychosocial problems.

What do they actually do? Can they help South Africa realize universal health coverage? As the proactive arm of the health services, community health workers teams provide household and community education, early screening, tracing and referrals for a range of health and social services. There is little local or global evidence on the household services provided by such teams, beyond specific disease-oriented activities such as for HIV and TB. This paper seeks to address this gap. METHODS: Descriptive secondary data analysis of community health worker team activities in the Ekurhuleni health district, South Africa covering approximately 280,000 households with 1 million people. RESULTS: Study findings illustrated that community health workers in these teams provided early screening and referrals for pregnant women and children under five. They distributed condoms and chronic medication to homes. They screened and referred for hypertension, diabetes mellitus, HIV and TB. The teams also undertook defaulter and contact tracing, the majority of which was for HIV and TB clients. Psychosocial support provided was in the form of access to social grants, access to child and gender-based violence protection services, food parcels and other services. CONCLUSION: Community health workers form the core of these teams and perform several health and psychosocial services in households and poor communities in South Africa, in addition to general health education. The teams studied provided a range of activities across many health conditions (mother and child related, HIV and TB, non-communicable diseases), as well as social services. These teams provided comprehensive care in a large-scale urban setting and can improve access to care.","Thomas, L.

672438,Preventing Media-Based False Hopes-Reply.,2021-08-23,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the relationship between food insecurity, sleep quality, and days with mental and physical health issues among college students. DESIGN: An online survey was administered. Food insecurity was assessed using the ten-item Adult Food Security Survey Module. Sleep was measured using the nineteen-item Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Mental health and physical health were measured using three items from the Healthy Days Core Module. Multivariate logistic regression was conducted to assess the relationship between food insecurity, sleep quality, and days with poor mental and physical health. SETTING: Twenty-two higher education institutions. PARTICIPANTS: College students (n 17 686) enrolled at one of twenty-two participating universities. RESULTS: Compared with food-secure students, those classified as food insecure (43·4 %) had higher PSQI scores indicating poorer sleep quality (P < 0·0001) and reported more days with poor mental (P < 0·0001) and physical (P < 0·0001) health as well as days when mental and physical health prevented them from completing daily activities (P < 0·0001). Food-insecure students had higher adjusted odds of having poor sleep quality (adjusted OR (AOR): 1·13; 95 % CI 1·12, 1·14), days with poor physical health (AOR: 1·01; 95 % CI 1·01, 1·02), days with poor mental health (AOR: 1·03; 95 % CI 1·02, 1·03) and days when poor mental or physical health prevented them from completing daily activities (AOR: 1·03; 95 % CI 1·02, 1·04). CONCLUSIONS: College students report high food insecurity which is associated with poor mental and physical health, and sleep quality. Multi-level policy changes and campus wellness programmes are needed to prevent food insecurity and improve student health-related outcomes.","Hagedorn, Rebecca L; Olfert, Melissa D; MacNell, Lillian; Houghtaling, Bailey; Hood, Lanae B; Savoie Roskos, Mateja R; Goetz, Jeannine R; Kern-Lyons, Valerie; Knol, Linda L; Mann, Georgianna R; Esquivel, Monica K; Hege, Adam; Walsh, Jennifer; Pearson, Keith; Berner, Maureen; Soldavini, Jessica; Anderson-Steeves, Elizabeth T; Spence, Marsha; Paul, Christopher; Waity, Julia F; Wall-Bassett, Elizabeth D; Hingle, Melanie D; Kelly, E Brooke; Lillis, J Porter; Coleman, Patty; Fontenot, Mary Catherine",Public health nutrition,https://doi.org/10.1017/s1368980021001191; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33745495/,259
672442,Clinical characteristics and outcomes of COVID‐19 in patients with type 2 diabetes in Turkey: A nationwide study (TurCoviDia),2021-03-24,"Although primarily affecting the respiratory system, COVID-19 causes multiple organ damage. One of its grave consequences is a prothrombotic state that manifests as thrombotic, microthrombotic and thromboembolic events. Therefore, understanding the effect of antiplatelet and anticoagulation therapy in the context of COVID-19 treatment is important. The aim of this rapid review was to highlight the role of thrombosis in COVID-19 and to provide new insights on the use of antithrombotic therapy in its management. A rapid systematic review was performed using preferred reporting items for systematic reviews. Papers published in English on antithrombotic agent use and COVID-19 complications were eligible. Results showed that the use of anticoagulants increased survival and reduced thromboembolic events in patients. However, despite the use of anticoagulants, patients still suffered thrombotic events likely due to heparin resistance. Data on antiplatelet use in combination with anticoagulants in the setting of COVID-19 are quite scarce. Current side effects of anticoagulation therapy emphasise the need to update treatment guidelines. In this rapid review, we address a possible modulatory role of antiplatelet and anticoagulant combination against COVID-19 pathogenesis. This combination may be an effective form of adjuvant therapy against COVID-19 infection. However, further studies are needed to elucidate potential risks and benefits associated with this combination.","Matli, Kamal; Farah, Raymond; Maalouf, Mario; Chamoun, Nibal; Costanian, Christy; Ghanem, Georges",Open Heart,https://doi.org/10.1136/openhrt-2021-001628; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34099529/,259

672604,Implementation of serological and molecular tools to inform COVID-19 patient management: protocol for the GENCOV prospective cohort study,2021-09-30,"Endothelial dysfunction has been implicated in atherosclerosis, ischemic heart disease, and stroke. Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), found in the bone marrow and peripheral blood as rare cell population, demonstrated a high proliferation and differentiation capacity. Understanding how such diseases influence the quantity and functionality of EPCs is essential for the development of novel therapies. This study aims to investigate the factors that affect the quantity and functionality of circulating EPCs in stroke patients and healthy controls. Blood samples were collected once from healthy donors (n = 30) and up to 3 times (within 7 days (baseline), 3 and 12 months post-stroke) from stroke patients (n = 207). EPC subpopulations were isolated with flow cytometry for characterization. The Matrigel tubular formation assay was performed as a measure of functionality. An increased amount of circulating EPCs was observed in stroke patients over 45 years when compared to age-matched healthy individuals. EPCs showed a rising trend in stroke patients over the 12-month post-stroke period, reaching statistical significance at 12 months post-stroke. Isolated CD34(+)KDR(+) cells from stroke patients showed impairment in tubular formation capability when compared to cells from healthy donors. The quantity and vasculogenic function of circulating EPCs in peripheral blood have been effectively evaluated in stroke patients and healthy control donors in this study. Age and stroke are found to be 2 influencing factors on the angiogenic capacity. It is suggested that the increase in EPC number is triggered by the recovery response following ischemic stroke.

Experimental studies have shown the stronger binding affinity of the RBD (receptor binding domain) of CoV-2-S to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as compared to that of SARS-CoV spike (CoV–S). However, a similar or weaker binding affinity of CoV-2-S compared to that of CoV–S is observed if entire spikes are used in the bioassay. To explore the underlying mechanism, we calculated the binding affinities of the RBDs to ACE2 and simulated the transitions between ACE2-inaccessible and -accessible conformations. We found that the ACE2-accessible angle of CoV-2-S is 52.2° and that the ACE2 binding strength of CoV-2-S RBD is much stronger than that of CoV–S RBD. However, CoV-2-S has much less of an ACE2-accessible conformation and is much more difficult to shift from ACE2-inaccessible to -accessible than CoV–S, making the binding affinity of the entire protein decrease. Further analysis revealed key interactional residues for strong binding and five potential ligand-binding pockets for drug research.","Peng, Cheng; Zhu, Zhengdan; Shi, Yulong; Wang, Xiaoyu; Mu, Kaijie; Yang, Yanqing; Zhang, Xinben; Xu, Zhijian; Zhu, Weiliang",J Phys Chem Lett,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33274945/; https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpclett.0c02958,259

There are many genes that collectively comprise this response and the extent to which each gene responds to PRRSV infection is unclear and warrants further investigation. To this end, we have utilized real-time PCR using SYBR Green I dye-based detection to quantify transcript abundance of the type I interferons (IFN-α and -β) and IFN-β transcriptional enhanceasome genes. In MARC-145 cells, both IFN-α and -β transcript abundance were unaffected by PRRSV infection. However, stimulation of MARC-145 cells by exogenous double-stranded RNA, resulted in significant increases in transcript abundance of both IFN-α and -β as well as IFN-β enhanceasome components, indicating that a type I IFN response could be induced in these cells. The double-stranded RNA induction of type I IFN transcription was significantly inhibited by dual-exposure with PRRSV. These results suggest that PRRSV infection directly interferes with type I IFN transcriptional activation early in its pathway, at the level of IFN-β gene transcription.","Miller, L. C.; Laegreid, W.

674434,Telemanagement of Home-Isolated COVID-19 Patients Using Oxygen Therapy With Noninvasive Positive Pressure Ventilation and Physical Therapy Techniques: Randomized Clinical Trial,2021-04-28,"Background: The EPICOVID19-RS study conducted 10 population-based surveys in Rio Grande do Sul (Southern Brazil), starting early in the epidemic. The sensitivity of the rapid point-of-care test used in the first eight surveys has been shown to decrease over time after some phases of the study were concluded. The 9th survey used both the rapid test and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test, which has a higher and stable sensitivity. Methods: We provide a theoretical justification for a correction procedure of the rapid test estimates, assess its performance in a simulated dataset and apply it to empirical data from the EPICOVID19-RS study. COVID-19 deaths from official statistics were used as an indicator of the temporal distribution of the epidemic, under the assumption that fatality is constant over time. Both the indicator and results from the 9th survey were used to calibrate the temporal decay function of the rapid test's sensitivity from a previous validation study, which was used to estimate the true sensitivity in each survey and adjust the rapid test estimates accordingly. Results: Simulations corroborated the procedure is valid. Corrected seroprevalence estimates were substantially larger than uncorrected estimates, which were substantially smaller than respective estimates from confirmed cases and therefore clearly underestimate the true infection prevalence. Conclusion: Correcting biased estimates requires a combination of data and modelling assumptions. This work illustrates the practical utility of analytical procedures, but also the critical need for good quality, populationally-representative data for tracking the progress of the epidemic and substantiate both projection models and policy making.","Hartwig, F.

675896,COVID‐19 and Diabetes: Insulin Requirements Parallel Illness Severity in Critically Unwell Patients,2020-07-19,"BACKGROUND: Microvascular, arterial and venous thrombotic events have been largely described during severe coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19). However, mechanisms underlying hemostasis dysregulation remain unclear. METHODS: We explored two independent cross-sectional cohorts to identify soluble markers and gene-expression signatures that discriminated COVID-19 severity and outcomes. RESULTS: We found that elevated soluble (s)P-selectin at admission was associated with disease severity. Elevated sP-selectin was predictive of intubation and death (ROC AUC = 0.67, p = 0.028 and AUC = 0.74, p = 0.0047, respectively). An optimal cutoff value was predictive of intubation with 66% negative predictive value (NPV) and 61% positive predictive value (PPV), and of death with 90% NPV and 55% PPV. An unbiased gene set enrichment analysis revealed that critically ill patients had increased expression of genes related to platelet activation. Hierarchical clustering identified ITG2AB, GP1BB, PPBP and SELPLG to be upregulated in a grade-dependent manner. ROC curve analysis for the prediction of intubation was significant for SELPLG and PPBP (AUC = 0.8, p = 0.046 for both). An optimal cutoff value for PBPP was predictive of intubation with 100% NPV and 45% PPV, and for SELPLG with 100% NPV and 50% PPV. CONCLUSION: We provide evidence that platelets contribute to COVID-19 severity. Plasma sP-selectin level was associated with severity and in-hospital mortality. Transcriptional analysis identified PPBP/CXCL7 and SELPLG as biomarkers for intubation. These findings provide additional evidence for platelet activation in driving critical COVID-19. Specific studies evaluating the performance of these biomarkers are required.

Optical functional nanostructures that manipulate and confine light on a nanometer scale have recently emerged as leading candidates for a wide range of applications in solar energy conversion and biosensing. In this review, recent research progress in the development of photonic and plasmonic nanostructures for various applications in solar energy conversion, such as photovoltaics, photothermal conversion, and photocatalysis, is highlighted. Furthermore, the combination of photonic and plasmonic nanostructures for developing high-efficiency solar energy conversion systems is explored and discussed. We also discuss recent applications of photonic–plasmonic-based biosensors in the rapid management of infectious diseases at point-of-care as well as terahertz biosensing and imaging for improving global health.

680027,An emergency plan for management of COVID‐19 patients in rural areas,2021-07-05,"Transdisciplinary research and innovation (R&I) efforts have emerged as a means to address challenges to sustainable transformation. One of the main elements of transdisciplinary efforts is the ‘inclusion’ of different stakeholders, values and perspectives in participatory R&I processes. In practice, however, ‘doing inclusion’ raises a number of challenges. In this article, we aim to contribute to re-politicizing inclusion in transdisciplinarity for transformation, by (1) empirically unraveling four key challenges that emerge in the political practice of ‘doing inclusion’, (2) illustrating how facilitators of inclusion processes perform balancing acts when confronted with these challenges, and (3) reflecting on what the unfolding dynamics suggests about the politics of stakeholder inclusion for societal transformation. In doing so, we analyze the transdisciplinary FIT4FOOD2030 project (2017–2020)—an EU-funded project that aimed to contribute to fostering EU R&I systems’ ability to catalyze food system transformation through stakeholder engagement in 25 Living Labs. Based on 3 years of action-research (including interviews, workshops and field observations), we identified four inherent political challenges to ‘doing inclusion’ in FIT4FOOD2030: (1) the challenge to meaningfully bring together powerful and marginalized stakeholders; (2) combining representation and deliberation of different stakeholder groups; (3) balancing diversities of inclusion with directionalities implied by transformative efforts; and (4) navigating the complexities of establishing boundaries of inclusion processes. We argue that by understanding ‘doing inclusion’ as a political practice, necessitating specificity about the (normative) ambitions in different inclusion settings, facilitators may better grasp and address challenges in transdisciplinarity for transformation.","Kok, Kristiaan P.

Although the conventional neutralization test (cVNT) remains the gold standard to confirm the presence of neutralizing antibodies in sera, the test is too labour-intensive for massive screening programs and less reproducible as live virus and cell culture is involved. Here, we performed an independent evaluation of a commercially available surrogate virus neutralization test (sVNT, GenScript cPass™) that can be done without biosafety level 3 containment in less than 2 hours. When using the cVNT and a Luminex multiplex immunoassay (MIA) as reference, the sVNT obtained a sensitivity of 94% (CI 90-96%) on a panel of 317 immune sera that were obtained from hospitalized and mild COVID-19 cases from Belgium and a sensitivity of 89% (CI 81-93%) on a panel of 184 healthcare workers from the Democratic Republic of Congo. We also found strong antibody titer correlations (r(s)>0.8) among the different techniques used. In conclusion, our evaluation suggests that the sVNT could be a powerful tool to monitor/detect neutralising antibodies in cohort and population studies.

However, the natural prevalence of antibodies against these viruses in serum among population is unknown. METHODS: To measure antibodies to the spike (S) protein of the four common non-SARS HCoVs, recombinant S proteins of the four HCoVs were expressed and characterised in 293 T cell. An S-protein-based indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) was then developed to detect anti-S IgG and IgM for the four individual HCoVs and applied to serum samples from a general asymptomatic population (218 children and 576 adults) in Beijing. RESULTS: Of 794 blood samples tested, only 29 (3.65%) were negative for anti-S IgG. The seropositivity of the four anti-S IgG antibodies was >70% within the general population. The majority of seroconversions to four-HCoV positivity first occurred in children. Both S-IgG and S-IgM antibodies were detectable among children and increased with age, reaching a plateau at 6 years of age. However, no anti-S IgM was detected in healthy adults.

681579,Can treatment with teicoplanin improve the prognosis of COVID-19 patients?,2021,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is a leading cause of death. Despite improvements in the cardiac disease management, OHCA outcomes remain poor. The purpose of this review is to provide information on the management of OHCA survivors, evidence-based treatments, and current gaps in the knowledge. RECENT FINDINGS: Most common cause of death from OHCA is neurological injury followed by shock and multiorgan failure. Prognostication tools are available to help with the clinical decision-making. Taking measures to improve EMS response time, encouraging bystander CPR, early defibrillation, and targeted temperature management are shown to improve survival. Early activation of cardiac catheterization lab for coronary angiography, hemodynamic assessment, and mechanical circulatory support should be considered in patients with shockable rhythm and presumed cardiac cause, those with ST elevation, ongoing ischemia, or evidence of hemodynamic and electrical instability. Randomized controlled trials are lacking in this field and benefits of interventions should be weighed against risk of pursuing a futile treatment. COVID-19 pandemic has added new challenges to the care of OHCA patients. SUMMARY: Clinical decision-making to care for OHCA patients is challenging. There is a need for trials to provide evidence-based knowledge on the care of OHCA patients.

We aimed to review the current evidence of the feasibility and effectiveness of Vaccines for COVID-19. METHODS: A search was carried out utilizing the keywords in the online databases, including Scopus,Web of Science, PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane. We included both human and non-human studies because of the vaccine novelty, which could limit our ability to include sufficient human studies. RESULTS: The review of studies showed that several SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are under development; different platforms are being used, including eight vaccines are adenovirus-based vectors, six vaccines are RNA-based formulations, one vaccine is DNA-based formulations, and other vaccines are using other platforms, including lipid nano particles. CONCLUSION: It is crucial to gather as much clinically relevant evidence as possible regarding the immunogenicity, efficacy, and safety profiles of these vaccines and adhere wisely to CDC protocols and guidelines of vaccine production.","Mehraeen, Esmaeil; Dadras, Omid; Afsahi, Amir Masoud; Karimi, Amirali; MohsseniPour, Mehrzad; Mirzapour, Pegah; Barzegary, Alireza; Behnezhad, Farzane; Habibi, Pedram; Salehi, Mohammad Amin; Vahedi, Farzin; Heydari, Mohammad; Kianzad, Shaghayegh; Moradmand-Badie, Banafsheh; Javaherian, Mohammad; SeyedAlinaghi, SeyedAhmad; Sabatier, Jean-Marc",Infectious disorders.

Its main reason is lack of a bigger study to analyse this question. The evidence of the affection of the foetus during antenatal or intrapartum period is limited to some anecdotal reports. To look for the possibility of vertical transmission of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome – Corona Virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection to the foetus, this prospective pilot study was conducted at a tertiary health care COVID-19 designated centre of Armed Forces. METHODS: This study was conducted during 01 June 2020 and 15 October 2020 and included 54 covid-positive pregnant mothers. During delivery, amniotic fluid and cord blood samples were collected in a sterile manner. Amniotic fluid samples were not collected during vaginal deliveries as chances of contamination was very high. These samples were tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 gene by Reverse Transcriptasee Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test, and the results were analysed. Newborns were allowed to room in with mother, and they underwent throat and nasal swab RT-PCR testing of covid within 24–48 h of delivery. RESULTS: A total of 1520 pregnant mothers underwent RT-PCR test during the study period. Total positivity rate among our pregnant women was 2.8%. Out of 54 covid-positive women during the study period, amniotic fluid RT-PCR tests were carried out for 43 women, and cord blood was tested for 45 women. CONCLUSION: RT-PCR test of amniotic fluid, cord blood and nasal and throat swab of all newborns delivered by SARS-CoV-2-positive pregnant women were negative. Based on our study, the possibility of intrauterine vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection appears to be unlikely.","Arora, D.; Rajmohan, K.S.; Dubey, Sudhir; Dey, Madhusudan; Singh, Sanjay; Nair, V.G.; Tiwari, R.P.; Tiwari, Shyamji",Med J Armed Forces India,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34334910/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0377123721000149; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377123721000149; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mjafi.2021.01.007,259

684974,A local experience of non-operative management for an appendicitis cohort during COVID-19,2021-02-12,"The ability to infect and replicate in monocytes/macrophages is a critically distinguishing feature between the two feline coronavirus (FCoV) pathotypes: feline enteric coronavirus (FECV; low-virulent) and feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV; lethal). Previously, by comparing serotype II strains FIPV 79-1146 and FECV 79-1683 and recombinant chimeric forms thereof in cultured feline bone marrow macrophages, we mapped this difference to the C-terminal part of the viral spike (S) protein (S2). In view of the later identified diagnostic difference in this very part of the S protein of serotype I FCoV pathotypes, the present study aimed to further define the contribution of the earlier observed ten amino acids difference to the serotype II virus phenotype in macrophages. Using targeted RNA recombination as a reverse genetics system we introduced the mutations singly and in combinations into the S gene and evaluated their effects on the infection characteristics of the mutant viruses in macrophages. While some of the single mutations had a significant effect, none of them fully reverted the infection phenotype. Only by combining five specific mutations the infections mediated by the FIPV and FECV spike proteins could be fully blocked or potentiated, respectively. Hence, the differential macrophage infection phenotype is caused by the cooperative effect of five mutations, which occur in five functionally different domains of the spike fusion subunit S2. The significance of these observations will be discussed, taking into account also some questions related to the identity of the virus strains used.","Shirato, Kazuya; Chang, Hui-Wen; Rottier, Peter J.M.",Virus Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29936068/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2018.06.010; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170218301370; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170218301370,259

686311,Clinical significance of smell and taste dysfunction and other related factors in COVID-19,2021-01-01,"The most striking difference between the subgenomic mRNA8 of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus isolated from human and some animal species is the deletion of 29 nucleotides, resulting in splitting of a single ORF (ORF8) into two ORFs (ORF8a and ORF8b). ORF8a and ORF8b are predicted to encode two small proteins, 8a and 8b, and ORF8 a single protein, 8ab (a fusion form of 8a and 8b). To understand the functions of these proteins, we cloned cDNA fragments covering these ORFs into expression plasmids, and expressed the constructs in both in vitro and in vivo systems. Expression of a construct containing ORF8a and ORF8b generated only a single protein, 8a; no 8b protein expression was obtained. Expression of a construct containing ORF8 generated the 8ab fusion protein. Site‐directed mutagenesis and enzymatic treatment revealed that protein 8ab is modified by N‐linked glycosylation on the N81 residue and by ubiquitination. In the absence of the 8a region, protein 8b undergoes rapid degradation by proteasomes, and addition of proteasome inhibitors inhibits the degradation of protein 8b as well as the protein 8b‐induced rapid degradation of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus E protein. Glycosylation could also stabilize protein 8ab. More interestingly, the two proteins could bind to monoubiquitin and polyubiquitin, suggesting the potential involvement of these proteins in the pathogenesis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus.","Le, Tra M.; Wong, Hui H.; Tay, Felicia P.

Aims To find the proportion of vaccine recipients with adverse events following the first and second doses of Covishield vaccination along with assessment of the symptom profile and timeline of appearance of symptoms following vaccination with each dose along with association of adverse events with comorbidity status of the respondents. Materials & Methods Cross-sectional study with secondary data taken from the AEFI database of the Covid Cell ,Directorate of Medical Education of the Kerala state.The database is formed with responses collected as online self-reporting forms collected from the health workers (doctors, nurses, students, paramedical, housekeeping and clerical staff) who received vaccination from vaccination centres in government owned Medical Colleges in Kerala for a period of three months from the date of rolling out vaccination in the state. Results A total of 4402 healthworkers submitted the forms after taking the vaccination,either first dose or second dose.Out of this 3656(83.1%)responders were after first dose and 746(16.9%)participants responded after second dose 63.3% respondents after first dose & 24.3% after second dose reported they had experienced adverse events following vaccination with first or second dose of the vaccine respectively.The first symptom to be noticed in those who reported the adverse event after first dose was body ache (17.9%) followed by headache in 15.1 % of participants. 11% (403 out of 3656 )of the responders after first dose were having comorbidities and 8.3 % were taking concomitant medications. History of being an asthmatic was found to be of increased risk for developing symptoms following first dose of vaccination(p value 0.004 ,OR-1.269,95% CI 1.127-1.429) whereas diabetes mellitus is not identified as a risk factor for development of adverse events though a significant association is found,might be due to a decreased reactogenicity.Among those who responded after receiving second dose of vaccination,24.3% reported they had adverse events(at least one post vaccination symptom),of which the first symptom experienced was headache (25.5%),followed by fever(20.9%) as compared to bodyache and headache after the first dose. Conclusions 56.7% of those who responded after receiving either first or second dose of the vaccine developed at least one symptom afterwards (63.3% after first and 24.3% after second dose of the vaccine respectively)with mean duration of appearance of symptoms being 8.5 hours and for majority of respondents the symptoms lasted for a day only.The first symptom to appear was bodyache (first dose),fever(in second dose) Though 8.5% respondents had a history of previous Covid infection it had no association with adverse events.Symptoms like chestpain,dry mouth ,breathing difficulty which are not being spelled out in Covishield factsheet ,has also been reported by the study respondents.Seizures were also reported as an adverse event by the responders.","A, R.; Mathew, T.; Nair, H.; Rajasekharan Nair, G.

METHODS: We examined the association between hydroxychloroquine use and intubation or death at a large medical center in New York City. Data were obtained regarding consecutive patients hospitalized with Covid-19, excluding those who were intubated, died, or discharged within 24 hours after presentation to the emergency department (study baseline). The primary end point was a composite of intubation or death in a time-to-event analysis. We compared outcomes in patients who received hydroxychloroquine with those in patients who did not, using a multivariable Cox model with inverse probability weighting according to the propensity score. RESULTS: Of 1446 consecutive patients, 70 patients were intubated, died, or discharged within 24 hours after presentation and were excluded from the analysis. Of the remaining 1376 patients, during a median follow-up of 22.5 days, 811 (58.9%) received hydroxychloroquine (600 mg twice on day 1, then 400 mg daily for a median of 5 days); 45.8% of the patients were treated within 24 hours after presentation to the emergency department, and 85.9% within 48 hours. Hydroxychloroquine-treated patients were more severely ill at baseline than those who did not receive hydroxychloroquine (median ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen, 223 vs. 360). Overall, 346 patients (25.1%) had a primary end-point event (180 patients were intubated, of whom 66 subsequently died, and 166 died without intubation). In the main analysis, there was no significant association between hydroxychloroquine use and intubation or death (hazard ratio, 1.04, 95% confidence interval, 0.82 to 1.32). Results were similar in multiple sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: In this observational study involving patients with Covid-19 who had been admitted to the hospital, hydroxychloroquine administration was not associated with either a greatly lowered or an increased risk of the composite end point of intubation or death.

Los requerimientos energéticos y proteicos en esta fase se adaptarán a la afectación del estado nutricional, con especial atención a la pérdida de masa muscular. Es necesario adaptar las recomendaciones dietéticas a efectos secundarios de la infección por SARS-CoV-2: anorexia, disfagia, disgeusia, y diarrea. La anorexia y el hipercatabolismo dificulta el cumplimiento de los requerimiento a través de la alimentación, por lo que se recomienda la utilización de soporte nutricional oral y en las fases severas la nutrición enteral o la parenteral.

As well as the sarcopenia assessment using the SCARF scale, and the possibility of using the GLIM criteria in those patients who have been tested positive by MUST. It is important to adapt the nutritional recommendations in the caloric and protein intake, to the CKD stage and to the SARS-CoV2 infection stage. In patients with hypercatabolism, to prioritize preserving the nutritional status (35 kcal / kg weight / day, proteins up to 1.5 g / kg / day). The rest of the nutrients will be adapted to CKD stage and the analytical values. In the post-infection stage, a complete nutritional assessment is recommended, including sarcopenia. The energy and protein requirements in this phase will be adapted to the nutritional status, with special attention to the loss of muscle mass. Dietary recommendations need to be tailored to side effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection: anorexia, dysphagia, dysgeusia, and diarrhea.

688691,Postacute Sequelae of COVID-19 Infection and Development of a Physiatry-Led Recovery Clinic,2021-04-29,"For last two decades, the demand for precisely engineered three-dimensional structures has increased continuously for the developments of biomaterials. With the recent advances in micro- and nano-fabrication techniques, various devices with complex surface geometries have been devised and produced in the pharmaceutical and medical fields for various biomedical applications including drug delivery and biosensors. These advanced biomaterials have been designed to mimic the natural environments of tissues more closely and to enhance the performance for their corresponding biomedical applications. One of the important aspects in the rational design of biomaterials is how to configure the surface of the biomedical devices for better control of the chemical and physical properties of the bioactive surfaces without compromising their bulk characteristics. In this viewpoint, it of critical importance to secure a versatile method to modify the surface of various biomedical devices. Recently, a vapor phase method, termed initiated chemical vapor deposition (iCVD) has emerged as damage-free method highly beneficial for the conformal deposition of various functional polymer films onto many kinds of micro- and nano-structured surfaces without restrictions on the substrate material or geometry, which is not trivial to achieve by conventional solution-based surface functionalization methods. With proper structural design, the functional polymer thin film via iCVD can impart required functionality to the biomaterial surfaces while maintaining the fine structure thereon. We believe the iCVD technique can be not only a valuable approach towards fundamental cell-material studies, but also of great importance as a platform technology to extend to other prospective biomaterial designs and material interface modifications for biomedical applications.","Cho, Younghak; Lee, Minseok; Park, Seonghyeon; Kim, Yesol; Lee, Eunjung; Im, Sung Gap",Biotechnol Bioprocess Eng,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33821132/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s12257-020-0269-1,259

Medical Professionalism and Observership utilizes didactics, reflective writing, small- and large- group discussions, and clinical observerships to enhance the process of professional identity formation during a critical developmental window of late- adolescence. The pilot semester included a sample of 135 students, all in their sophomore, junior, or senior years of study at Rice University. Students were selected through an application process and paired with physicians at Houston Methodist Hospital based on specialty preference and availability. Students were required to participate in biweekly lectures and discussions and to submit a weekly reflection on topics discussed in the course and their shadowing experiences. Student evaluations were administered to survey changes in students’ knowledge and perceptions of the curriculum. Selected reflections were read for evidence of professional identity formation. Lectures increased students’ exposure to core competencies within the medical profession and influenced their desire to become physicians. Reflective writings demonstrated integration of these core competencies into the professional identity of students. Structured reflection and didactics, when coupled with physician shadowing, appear to promote integration of the values, beliefs, and attitudes of medical professionalism. Future studies should seek to demonstrate how such a curriculum affects professional identity formation through established measures, and to assess whether such a curriculum may influence students’ preparedness for medical training and practice as they progress along their careers.","Merlo, Gia; Ryu, Hanjun; Harris, Toi B.; Coverdale, John",Medical education online,https://doi.org/10.1080/10872981.2021.1886224; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33606590/,259
689526,Obesity and risk of COVID-19: analysis of UK Biobank,2020-05-28,"Parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5) is widespread in mammals and humans. Up to now, there is little information about PIV5 infection in lesser pandas. In this study, a PIV5 variant (named ZJQ-221) was isolated from a lesser panda with respiratory disease in Guangzhou zoo in Guangdong province, southern China. The full-length genome of ZJQ-221 was found to be 15,246 nucleotides and consisted of seven non-overlapping genes encoding eight proteins (i.e., NP, V, P, M, F, SH, HN and L). Sequence alignment and genetic analysis revealed that ZJQ-221 shared a close relationship with a PIV5 strain of canine-origin (1168-1) from South Korea. The findings of this study confirm the presence of PIV5 in lesser panda and indicate this mammal as a possible natural reservoir. Furthermore they highlight the urgent need to strengthen viral surveillance and control of PIV5 in zoo animals.

689629,"Bereavement care for ethnic minority communities: A systematic review of access to, models of, outcomes from, and satisfaction with, service provision",2021-06-30,"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic represents a major societal challenge that requires large-scale behaviour change, widespread collective action and cooperation to reduce viral transmission. Existing literature indicates that several messaging approaches may be effective, including emphasising the benefits to the recipient, aligning with the recipient’s moral values and focusing on protecting others. Current research suggests that prosocial public health messages that highlight behaviours linked to societal benefits (eg, protecting ‘each other’), rather than focusing on behaviours that protect oneself (eg, protecting ‘yourself’), may be a more effective method for communicating strategies related to infectious disease. To investigate this we will conduct a systematic review that will identify what messages and behaviour change techniques have the potential to optimise the effect on population behaviour in relation to reducing transmission of respiratory infections. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A systematic literature search of published and unpublished studies (including grey literature) in electronic databases will be conducted to identify those that meet our inclusion criteria. The search will be run in four electronic databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and Scopus. We will also conduct supplementary searches in databases of ‘grey’ literature such as PsycEXTRA, Social Science Research Network and OSF PREPRINTS, and use the Google Scholar search engine. A systematic approach to searching, screening, reviewing and data extraction will be applied based on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. Titles, abstracts and full texts for eligibility will be examined independently by researchers. The quality of the included studies will be assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool and the Risk of Bias in Non-randomized Studies-of Interventions tool. Disagreements will be resolved by a consensus procedure. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This protocol has been registered with PROSPERO. No ethical approval is required, as there will be no collection of primary data. The synthesised findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publication.

690008,In systemic sclerosis patients the anxiety disorder and Raynaud’s phenomenon are increased during lock down period for COVID-19 pandemic,2020-11-11,"Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a life-threatening noncardiogenic circulatory disorder of the lungs associated with critical illnesses such as sepsis, trauma, and immune and collagen vascular disease. Its mortality rate is marginally improved with the best supportive care. The demise occurs due to progressive pulmonary hypoxia and multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) with severe inflammation. Complement activation is a part of immune response against pathogen or insult in which membrane attack complex (MAC) is formed and eliminates microbes. If complement regulatory protein such as endothelial CD59 is underexpressed, MAC may also cause pulmonary vascular injury to the innocent bystander endothelial cell of host and provokes endotheliopathy that causes inflammation and pulmonary vascular microthrombosis, leading to ARDS. Its pathogenesis is based on a novel “two-path unifying theory” of hemostasis and “two-activation theory of the endothelium” promoting molecular pathogenesis. Endotheliopathy activates two independent molecular pathways: inflammatory and microthrombotic. The former triggers the release inflammatory cytokines and the latter promotes exocytosis of unusually large von Willebrand factor multimers (ULVWF) and platelet activation. Inflammatory pathway initiates inflammation, but microthrombotic pathway more seriously produces “microthrombi strings” composed of platelet-ULVWF complexes, which become anchored on the injured endothelial cells, and causes disseminated intravascular microthrombosis (DIT). DIT is a hemostatic disease due to lone activation of ULVWF path without activated tissue factor path. It leads to endotheliopathy-associated vascular microthrombotic disease (EA-VMTD), which orchestrates consumptive thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and MODS. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP)-like syndrome is the hematologic phenotype of EA-VMTD. ARDS is one of organ phenotypes among MODS associated with TTP-like syndrome. The most effective treatment of ARDS can be achieved by counteracting the activated microthrombotic pathway based on two novel hemostatic theories.","Chang, Jae C.",Clin Appl Thromb Hemost,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31775524/; https://doi.org/10.1177/1076029619887437,259
