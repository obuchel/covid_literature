407,Radiological and Clinical Characteristics of a Military Outbreak of Pandemic H1N1 2009 Influenza Virus Infection,2010-06-21,"OBJECTIVE: To describe detailed clinical and radiological features of the pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza viral infection among healthy young males in a semi-closed institutionalized setting. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 18 patients confirmed with the pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza virus infection from July 18 to July 30, 2009 were enrolled in this study. Each patient underwent an evaluation to determine detailed clinical and radiological features. RESULTS: All patients presented with high fever (> 38.0℃), with accompanying symptoms of cough, rhinorrhea, sore throat, myalgia and diarrhea, and increased C-reactive protein (CRP) values with no leukocytosis nor elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). All patients, including one patient who progressed into acute respiratory distress syndrome, were treated with oseltamivir phosphate and quickly recovered from their symptoms. Chest radiographs showed abnormalities of small nodules and lobar consolidation in only two out of 18 patients. However, six of 12 patients who underwent thin-section CT examinations showed abnormal findings for small ground-glass opacities (GGOs) in addition to poorly-defined nodules with upper lobe predominance. CONCLUSION: In a population of healthy young adults, elevated CRP with normal ESR and white blood cell levels combined with GGOs and nodules on thin-section CT scans may indicate early signs of infection by the pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza virus.","Yun, Tae Jin; Kwon, Gu Jin; Oh, Mi Kyeong; Woo, Sung Koo; Park, Seung Hoon; Choi, Seung Hong; Lee, Hyun Ju; Goo, Jin Mo; Yim, Jae-Joon; Kim, Jong Sung; Park, Chang Min",Korean J Radiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2893312/,175
441,Development of a large-scale isolation chamber system for the safe and humane care of medium-sized laboratory animals harboring infectious diseases,2010-10-01,"The close phylogenetic relationship between humans and non-human primates makes non-human primates an irreplaceable model for the study of human infectious diseases. In this study, we describe the development of a large-scale automatic multi-functional isolation chamber for use with medium-sized laboratory animals carrying infectious diseases. The isolation chamber, including the transfer chain, disinfection chain, negative air pressure isolation system, animal welfare system, and the automated system, is designed to meet all biological safety standards. To create an internal chamber environment that is completely isolated from the exterior, variable frequency drive blowers are used in the air-intake and air-exhaust system, precisely controlling the filtered air flow and providing an air-barrier protection. A double door transfer port is used to transfer material between the interior of the isolation chamber and the outside. A peracetic acid sterilizer and its associated pipeline allow for complete disinfection of the isolation chamber. All of the isolation chamber parameters can be automatically controlled by a programmable computerized menu, allowing for work with different animals in different-sized cages depending on the research project. The large-scale multi-functional isolation chamber provides a useful and safe system for working with infectious medium-sized laboratory animals in high-level bio-safety laboratories.","Pan, Xin; Qi, Jian-cheng; Long, Ming; Liang, Hao; Chen, Xiao; Li, Han; Li, Guang-bo; Zheng, Hao",Journal of Zhejiang University SCIENCE B,http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc2950238?pdf=render,175
519,Screening of Random Peptide Library of Hemagglutinin from Pandemic 2009 A(H1N1) Influenza Virus Reveals Unexpected Antigenically Important Regions,2011-03-18,"The antigenic structure of the membrane protein hemagglutinin (HA) from the 2009 A(H1N1) influenza virus was dissected with a high-throughput screening method using complex antisera. The approach involves generating yeast cell libraries displaying a pool of random peptides of controllable lengths on the cell surface, followed by one round of fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) against antisera from mouse, goat and human, respectively. The amino acid residue frequency appearing in the antigenic peptides at both the primary sequence and structural level was determined and used to identify “hot spots” or antigenically important regions. Unexpectedly, different antigenic structures were seen for different antisera. Moreover, five antigenic regions were identified, of which all but one are located in the conserved HA stem region that is responsible for membrane fusion. Our findings are corroborated by several recent studies on cross-neutralizing H1 subtype antibodies that recognize the HA stem region. The antigenic peptides identified may provide clues for creating peptide vaccines with better accessibility to memory B cells and better induction of cross-neutralizing antibodies than the whole HA protein. The scheme used in this study enables a direct mapping of the antigenic regions of viral proteins recognized by antisera, and may be useful for dissecting the antigenic structures of other viral proteins.","Xu, Wanghui; Han, Lu; Lin, Zhanglin",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3060926/,175
534,Interaction of a Specific Population of Human Embryonic Stem Cell–Derived Progenitor Cells with CD11b+ Cells Ameliorates Sepsis-Induced Lung Inflammatory Injury,2011-01-01,"Human embryonic stem cells differentiated under mesoderm-inducing conditions have important therapeutic properties in sepsis-induced lung injury in mice. Single cell suspensions obtained from day 7 human embryoid bodies (d7EBs) injected i.v. 1 hour after cecal ligation and puncture significantly reduced lung inflammation and edema as well as production of tumor necrosis factor-α and interferon-γ in lungs compared with controls, whereas interleukin-10 production remained elevated. d7EB cell transplantation also reduced mortality to 50% from 90% in the control group. The protection was ascribed to d7EB cell interaction with lung resident CD11b+ cells, and was correlated with the ability of d7EB cells to reduce it also reduced production of proinflammatory cytokines by CD11+ cells, and to endothelial NO synthase–derived NO by d7EB cells, leading to inhibition of inducible macrophage-type NO synthase activation in CD11b+ cells. The protective progenitor cells were positive for the endothelial and hematopoietic lineage marker angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). Only the ACE+ fraction modulated the proinflammatory profile of CD11b+ cells and reduced mortality in septic mice. In contrast to the nonprotective ACE-cell fraction, the ACE+ cell fraction also produced NO. These findings suggest that an ACE+ subset of human embryonic stem cell–derived progenitor cells has a highly specialized anti-inflammatory function that ameliorates sepsis-induced lung inflammation and reduces mortality.","Toya, Sophie P.; Li, Fei; Bonini, Marcelo G.; Gomez, Ignatius; Mao, Mao; Bachmaier, Kurt W.; Malik, Asrar B.",The American Journal of Pathology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3069906/,175
567,Dynamic variations in the peripheral blood lymphocyte subgroups of patients with 2009 pandemic H1N1 swine-origin influenza A virus infection,2011-05-10,"BACKGROUND: Novel Influenza A (H1N1) is an acute respiratory infectious disease. Animal experiments indicated that when H1N1 virus infected early hosts, it showed strong CD4(+), CD8(+), and CD4(+)CD25(+ )T cell reactions. The aim of this study was to investigate the dynamic fluctuations of the peripheral blood lymphocyte subgroups in patients infected with H1N1 swine-origin influenza A virus (S-OIV). METHODS: The frequency of T cells, B cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and regulatory T cells (Treg) in 36 severe H1N1 and 40 moderate H1N1 patients were detected at different periods by flow cytometry. In parallel, serum cytokines were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and C-reactive protein (CRP) was analyzed through an image-type automatic biochemical analyzer. In addition, 20 healthy volunteers, who were not infected with 2009 H1N1 virus, were selected as controls. RESULTS: The frequency of NK cells were decreased in all cases and CD19(+ )B cells were increased in severe cases than those of the controls. At 1-2d from onset, the frequency of CD4(+ )and CD4(+)CD25(+ )T cells in moderate cases was higher than in the severe cases. Serum cytokines, specifically IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, and IFN-γ exhibited no significant change both in the moderate and the severe cases during the whole monitoring process. In the early stage of the disease, serum CRP levels in the severe and moderate groups were significantly higher than that in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Patients showed different lymphocyte subgroup distributions between mild and severe cases, which might affect the incidence and development of 2009 H1N1.","Guo, Xichao; Chen, Yu; Li, Xuefen; Kong, Haishen; Yang, Shigui; Ye, Bo; Cui, Dawei; Wu, Wei; Li, Lanjuan",Virol J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3104371/,175
580,Gene Expression Profile during Chondrogenesis in Human Bone Marrow derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells using a cDNA Microarray,2011-06-20,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have the capacity to proliferate and differentiate into multiple connective tissue lineages, which include cartilage, bone, and fat. Cartilage differentiation and chondrocyte maturation are required for normal skeletal development, but the intracellular pathways regulating this process remain largely unclear. This study was designed to identify novel genes that might help clarify the molecular mechanisms of chondrogenesis. Chondrogenesis was induced by culturing human bone marrow (BM) derived MSCs in micromass pellets in the presence of defined medium for 3, 7, 14 or 21 days. Several genes regulated during chondrogenesis were then identified by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Using an ABI microarray system, we determined the differential gene expression profiles of differentiated chondrocytes and BM-MSCs. Normalization of this data resulted in the identification of 1,486 differentially expressed genes. To verify gene expression profiles determined by microarray analysis, the expression levels of 10 genes with high fold changes were confirmed by RT-PCR. Gene expression patterns of 9 genes (Hrad6B, annexinA2, BMP-7, contactin-1, peroxiredoxin-1, heat shock transcription factor-2, synaptotagmin IV, serotonin receptor-7, Axl) in RT-PCR were similar to the microarray gene expression patterns. These findings provide novel information concerning genes involved in the chondrogenesis of human BM-MSCs.","Yoo, Hyun Jung; Yoon, Sung Soo; Park, Seon Yang; Lee, Eun Young; Lee, Eun Bong; Kim, Ju Han; Song, Yeong Wook",J Korean Med Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3124712/,175
606,The Interaction of LFA-1 on Mononuclear Cells and ICAM-1 on Tubular Epithelial Cells Accelerates TGF-β1-Induced Renal Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition,2011-08-05,"The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of renal epithelial cells (RTECs) has pivotal roles in the development of renal fibrosis. Although the interaction of lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA-1) on leukocytes and its ligand, intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), plays essential roles in most inflammatory reactions, its pathogenetic role in the EMT of RTECs remains to be clarified. In the present study, we investigated the effect of the interaction of LFA-1 on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and ICAM-1 on HK-2 cells after stimulation with TGF-β(1) on the EMT of RTECs. ICAM-1 was highly expressed in HK-2 cells. After TGF-β(1) stimulation, the chemokines CCL3 and CXCL12 increased on HK-2 cells. After co-culture of PBMCs and HK-2 cells pre-stimulated with TGF-β(1) (0.1 ng/ml) (HK-2-TGF-β(1) (0.1)), the expression of the active form of LFA-1 increased on PBMCs; however, total LFA-1 expression did not change. The expression of the active form of LFA-1 on PBMCs did not increase after co-culture with not CCL3 but CXCL12 knockdown HK-2-TGF-β(1) (0.1). The expression of epithelial cell junction markers (E-cadherin and occludin) further decreased and that of mesenchymal markers (vimentin and fibronectin) further increased in HK-2-TGF-β(1) (0.1) after co-culture with PBMCs for 24 hrs (HK-2-TGF-β(1) (0.1)-PBMCs). The phosphorylation of ERK 1/2 but not smad2 and smad3 increased in HK-2-TGF-β(1) (0.1)-PBMCs. The snail and slug signaling did not increase HK-2-TGF-β(1) (0.1)-PBMCs. Although the migration and invasion of HK-2 cells induced full EMT by a high dose (10.0 ng/ml) and long-term (72–96 hrs) TGF-β(1) stimulation increased, that of HK-2-TGF-β(1) (0.1)-PBMCs did not increase. These results suggested that HK-2 cells stimulated with TGF-β(1) induced conformational activation of LFA-1 on PBMCs by increased CXCL12. Then, the direct interaction of LFA-1 on PBMCs and ICAM-1 on HK-2 cells activated ERK1/2 signaling to accelerate the part of EMT of HK-2 cells induced by TGF-β(1.)","Morishita, Yoshiyuki; Watanabe, Minami; Nakazawa, Eiko; Ishibashi, Kenichi; Kusano, Eiji",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3151298/,175
648,The Ebola Virus Glycoprotein and HIV-1 Vpu Employ Different Strategies to Counteract the Antiviral Factor Tetherin,2011-11-01,"The antiviral protein tetherin/BST2/CD317/HM1.24 restricts cellular egress of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and of particles mimicking the Ebola virus (EBOV), a hemorrhagic fever virus. The HIV-1 viral protein U (Vpu) and the EBOV-glycoprotein (EBOV-GP) both inhibit tetherin. Here, we compared tetherin counteraction by EBOV-GP and Vpu. We found that EBOV-GP but not Vpu counteracted tetherin from different primate species, indicating that EBOV-GP and Vpu target tetherin differentially. Tetherin interacted with the GP2 subunit of EBOV-GP, which might encode the determinants for tetherin counteraction. Vpu reduced cell surface expression of tetherin while EBOV-GP did not, suggesting that both proteins employ different mechanisms to counteract tetherin. Finally, Marburg virus (MARV)–GP also inhibited tetherin and downregulated tetherin in a cell type–dependent fashion, indicating that tetherin antagonism depends on the cellular source of tetherin. Collectively, our results indicate that EBOV-GP counteracts tetherin by a novel mechanism and that tetherin inhibition is conserved between EBOV-GP and MARV-GP.","Kühl, Annika; Banning, Carina; Marzi, Andrea; Votteler, Jörg; Steffen, Imke; Bertram, Stephanie; Glowacka, Ilona; Konrad, Andreas; Stürzl, Michael; Guo, Ju-Tao; Schubert, Ulrich; Feldmann, Heinz; Behrens, Georg; Schindler, Michael; Pöhlmann, Stefan",The Journal of Infectious Diseases,https://academic.oup.com/jid/article-pdf/204/suppl_3/S850/18083665/jir378.pdf,175
676,Clinical aspects and cytokine response in severe H1N1 influenza A virus infection,2010-11-09,"INTRODUCTION: The immune responses in patients with novel A(H1N1) virus infection (nvA(H1N1)) are incompletely characterized. We investigated the profile of Th1 and Th17 mediators and interferon-inducible protein-10 (IP-10) in groups with severe and mild nvA(H1N1) disease and correlated them with clinical aspects. METHODS: Thirty-two patients hospitalized with confirmed nvA(H1N1) infection were enrolled in the study: 21 patients with nvA(H1N1)-acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and 11 patients with mild disease. One group of 20 patients with bacterial sepsis-ARDS and another group of 15 healthy volunteers were added to compare their cytokine levels with pandemic influenza groups. In the nvA(H1N1)-ARDS group, the serum cytokine samples were obtained on admission and 3 days later. The clinical aspects were recorded prospectively. RESULTS: In the nvA(H1N1)-ARDS group, obesity and lymphocytopenia were more common and IP-10, interleukin (IL)-12, IL-15, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-9 were significantly increased versus control. When comparing mild with severe nvA(H1N1) groups, IL-6, IL-8, IL-15 and TNFα were significantly higher in the severe group. In nonsurvivors versus survivors, IL-6 and IL-15 were increased on admission and remained higher 3 days later. A positive correlation of IL-6, IL-8 and IL-15 levels with C-reactive protein and with > 5-day interval between symptom onset and admission, and a negative correlation with the PaO(2):FiO(2 )ratio, were found in nvA(H1N1) groups. In obese patients with influenza disease, a significant increased level of IL-8 was found. When comparing viral ARDS with bacterial ARDS, the level of IL-8, IL-17 and TNFα was significantly higher in bacterial ARDS and IL-12 was increased only in viral ARDS. CONCLUSIONS: In our critically ill patients with novel influenza A(H1N1) virus infection, the hallmarks of the severity of disease were IL-6, IL-15, IL-8 and TNFα. These cytokines, except TNFα, had a positive correlation with the admission delay and C-reactive protein, and a negative correlation with the PaO(2):FiO(2 )ratio. Obese patients with nvA(H1N1) disease have a significant level of IL-8. There are significant differences in the level of cytokines when comparing viral ARDS with bacterial ARDS.","Hagau, Natalia; Slavcovici, Adriana; Gonganau, Daniel N; Oltean, Simona; Dirzu, Dan S; Brezoszki, Erika S; Maxim, Mihaela; Ciuce, Constantin; Mlesnite, Monica; Gavrus, Rodica L; Laslo, Carmen; Hagau, Radu; Petrescu, Magda; Studnicska, Daniela M",Crit Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3220006/,175
732,Distinct Regulation of Host Responses by ERK and JNK MAP Kinases in Swine Macrophages Infected with Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 Influenza Virus,2012-01-18,"Swine influenza is an acute respiratory disease in pigs caused by swine influenza virus (SIV). Highly virulent SIV strains cause mortality of up to 10%. Importantly, pigs have long been considered “mixing vessels” that generate novel influenza viruses with pandemic potential, a constant threat to public health. Since its emergence in 2009 and subsequent pandemic spread, the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 (H1N1pdm) has been detected in pig farms, creating the risk of generating new reassortants and their possible infection of humans. Pathogenesis in SIV or H1N1pdm-infected pigs remains poorly characterized. Proinflammatory and antiviral cytokine responses are considered correlated with the intensity of clinical signs, and swine macrophages are found to be indispensible in effective clearance of SIV from pig lungs. In this study, we report a unique pattern of cytokine responses in swine macrophages infected with H1N1pdm. The roles of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases in the regulation of the host responses were examined. We found that proinflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and TNF-α were significantly induced and their induction was ERK1/2-dependent. IFN-β and IFN-inducible antiviral Mx and 2′5′-OAS were sharply induced, but the inductions were effectively abolished when ERK1/2 was inhibited. Induction of CCL5 (RANTES) was completely inhibited by inhibitors of ERK1/2 and JNK1/2, which appeared also to regulate FasL and TNF-α, critical for apoptosis in pig macrophages. We found that NFκB was activated in H1N1pdm-infected cells, but the activation was suppressed when ERK1/2 was inhibited, indicating there is cross-talk between MAP kinase and NFκB responses in pig macrophages. Our data suggest that MAP kinase may activate NFκB through the induction of RIG-1, which leads to the induction of IFN-β in swine macrophages. Understanding host responses and their underlying mechanisms may help identify venues for effective control of SIV and assist in prevention of future influenza pandemics.","Gao, Wei; Sun, Wenkui; Qu, Bingqian; Cardona, Carol J.; Powell, Kira; Wegner, Marta; Shi, Yi; Xing, Zheng",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3261190/,175
741,Validation of Self-swab for Virologic Confirmation of Influenza Virus Infections in a Community Setting,2011-12-23,"Few studies have investigated the validity of self-collected nose and throat swabs for influenza confirmation in community settings. We followed outpatients with confirmed influenza with sequential measurement of viral loads and applied log-linear regression models to the viral shedding patterns. Among 176 outpatients with confirmed influenza, the detection of virus and quantitative viral loads obtained from self-swabs was consistent with statistical predictions based on earlier and later measurements, suggesting that self-collected nose and throat swabs can be a valid alternative for virologic confirmation of influenza A or B infection in a community setting.","Ip, Dennis K.

897,Molecular Imaging Reveals a Progressive Pulmonary Inflammation in Lower Airways in Ferrets Infected with 2009 H1N1 Pandemic Influenza Virus,2012-07-20,"Molecular imaging has gained attention as a possible approach for the study of the progression of inflammation and disease dynamics. Herein we used [(18)F]-2-deoxy-2-fluoro-D-glucose ([(18)F]-FDG) as a radiotracer for PET imaging coupled with CT (FDG-PET/CT) to gain insight into the spatiotemporal progression of the inflammatory response of ferrets infected with a clinical isolate of a pandemic influenza virus, H1N1 (H1N1pdm). The thoracic regions of mock- and H1N1pdm-infected ferrets were imaged prior to infection and at 1, 2, 3 and 6 days post-infection (DPI). On 1 DPI, FDG-PET/CT imaging revealed areas of consolidation in the right caudal lobe which corresponded with elevated [(18)F]-FDG uptake (maximum standardized uptake values (SUVMax), 4.7–7.0). By days 2 and 3, consolidation (CT) and inflammation ([(18)F]-FDG) appeared in the left caudal lobe. By 6 DPI, CT images showed extensive areas of patchy ground-glass opacities (GGO) and consolidations with the largest lesions having high SUVMax (6.0–7.6). Viral shedding and replication were detected in most nasal, throat and rectal swabs and nasal turbinates and lungs on 1, 2 and 3 DPI, but not on day 7, respectively. In conclusion, molecular imaging of infected ferrets revealed a progressive consolidation on CT with corresponding [(18)F]-FDG uptake. Strong positive correlations were measured between SUVMax and bronchiolitis-related pathologic scoring (Spearman’s ρ = 0.75). Importantly, the extensive areas of patchy GGO and consolidation seen on CT in the ferret model at 6 DPI are similar to that reported for human H1N1pdm infections. In summary, these first molecular imaging studies of lower respiratory infection with H1N1pdm show that FDG-PET can give insight into the spatiotemporal progression of the inflammation in real-time.","Jonsson, Colleen B.; Camp, Jeremy V.; Wu, Albert; Zheng, Huaiyu; Kraenzle, Jennifer L.; Biller, Ashley E.; Vanover, Carol D.; Chu, Yong-Kyu; Ng, Chin K.; Proctor, Mary; Sherwood, Leslie; Steffen, Marlene C.; Mollura, Daniel J.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3401186/,175
1077,Humoral immune response to HTLV-1 basic leucine zipper factor (HBZ) in HTLV-1-infected individuals,2013-02-13,"BACKGROUND: Human T cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) infection can lead to development of adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) or HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) in a subset of infected subjects. HTLV-1 basic leucine zipper factor (HBZ) gene has a critical role in HTLV-1 infectivity and the development of ATL and HAM/TSP. However, little is known about the immune response against HBZ in HTLV-1-infected individuals. In this study, we examined antibody responses against HBZ in serum/plasma samples from 436 subjects including HTLV-1 seronegative donors, asymptomatic carriers (AC), ATL, and HAM/TSP patients using the luciferase immunoprecipitation system. RESULTS: Immunoreactivity against HBZ was detected in subsets of all HTLV-1-infected individuals but the test did not discriminate between AC, ATL and HAM/TSP. However, the frequency of detection of HBZ-specific antibodies in the serum of ATL patients with the chronic subtype was higher than in ATL patients with the lymphomatous subtype. Antibody responses against HBZ were also detected in cerebrospinal fluid of HAM/TSP patients with anti-HBZ in serum. Antibody responses against HBZ did not correlate with proviral load and HBZ mRNA expression in HAM/TSP patients, but the presence of an HBZ-specific response was associated with reduced CD4(+) T cell activation in HAM/TSP patients. Moreover, HBZ-specific antibody inhibited lymphoproliferation in the PBMC of HAM/TSP patients. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report demonstrating humoral immune response against HBZ associated with HTLV-I infection. Thus, a humoral immune response against HBZ might play a role in HTLV-1 infection.","Enose-Akahata, Yoshimi; Abrams, Anna; Massoud, Raya; Bialuk, Izabela; Johnson, Kory R; Green, Patrick L; Maloney, Elizabeth M; Jacobson, Steven",Retrovirology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3584941/,175

In this study, the clinical and laboratory features of 36 patients from Turkey who are hospitalized in intensive care unit due to pandemic influenza A (H1N1) associated pneumonia and respiratory failure were retrospectively evaluated. The most common symptoms were cough and fever. Consolidation (36.1 %) and interstitial changes (30.6 %) were the most frequently identified findings on chest radiographs at the time of admission. Six of the patients (16.7 %) died. Mortality occurred in 3 of 13 patients (23.1 %) with underlying disease, whilst it occurred in only 3 of 23 patients (13 %) who were previously healthy. Mortality was found to be significantly associated only with an elevated lactate dehydrogenase level. A significant relationship was determined only between the presence of lymphopenia and acute respiratory distress syndrome and the need for intensive care treatment.

There is an urgent need for effective therapies for acute lung injury. Zhang and colleagues tested the efficacy of adipose-derived stem cells in acute lung injury in mice. When adipose-derived stem cells were delivered to mice that had been challenged with lipopolysaccharide, they potently limited acute lung inflammation and injury in the mice, indicating that adipose-derived stem cells have therapeutic potential in acute lung injury in humans.

1266,The Battle Between Influenza and the Innate Immune Response in the Human Respiratory Tract,2013-03-29,"Influenza is a viral infection of the respiratory tract. Infection is normally confined to the upper respiratory tract but certain viral strains have evolved the ability to infect the lower respiratory tract, including the alveoli, leading to inflammation and a disease pattern of diffuse alveolar damage. Factors leading to this sequence of events are novel influenza strains, or strains that have viral proteins, in particular the NS1 protein that allow it to escape the innate immune system. There are three main barriers that prevent infection of pneumocytes - mucin, host defence lectins and cells such as macrophages. Viruses have developed strategies such as neuraminidase and glycosylation patterns that allow this evasion. Though there has been much investment in antiviral drugs, it is proposed that more attention should be directed towards developing or utilizing compounds that enhance the ability of the innate immune system to combat viral infection.","Nicholls, John M",Infect Chemother,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3780943/,175
1384,Human immune responses to Plasmodium falciparum infection: molecular evidence for a suboptimal THαβ and TH17 bias over ideal and effective traditional TH1 immune response,2013-11-05,"BACKGROUND: Using microarray analysis, this study showed up-regulation of toll-like receptors 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, NF-κB, TNF, p38-MAPK, and MHC molecules in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells following infection with Plasmodium falciparum. METHODS: This analysis reports herein further studies based on time-course microarray analysis with focus on malaria-induced host immune response. RESULTS: The results show that in early malaria, selected immune response-related genes were up-regulated including α β and γ interferon-related genes, as well as genes of IL-15, CD36, chemokines (CXCL10, CCL2, S100A8/9, CXCL9, and CXCL11), TRAIL and IgG Fc receptors. During acute febrile malaria, up-regulated genes included α β and γ interferon-related genes, IL-8, IL-1b IL-10 downstream genes, TGFB1, oncostatin-M, chemokines, IgG Fc receptors, ADCC signalling, complement-related genes, granzymes, NK cell killer/inhibitory receptors and Fas antigen. During recovery, genes for NK receptorsand granzymes/perforin were up-regulated. When viewed in terms of immune response type, malaria infection appeared to induce a mixed TH1 response, in which α and β interferon-driven responses appear to predominate over the more classic IL-12 driven pathway. In addition, TH17 pathway also appears to play a significant role in the immune response to P. falciparum. Gene markers of TH17 (neutrophil-related genes, TGFB1 and IL-6 family (oncostatin-M)) and THαβ (IFN-γ and NK cytotoxicity and ADCC gene) immune response were up-regulated. Initiation of THαβ immune response was associated with an IFN-αβ response, which ultimately resulted in moderate-mild IFN-γ achieved via a pathway different from the more classic IL-12 TH1 pattern.

In response, we would like to review the accumulated evidence from several independent laboratories that adult tissues, including BM, harbor a population of very rare stem cells that may cross germ layers in their differentiation potential. Thus, the BM stem cell compartment hierarchy needs to be revisited. These dormant, early-development cells that our group described as very small embryonic-like stem cells (VSELs) most likely overlap with similar populations of stem cells that have been identified in adult tissues by other investigators as the result of various experimental strategies and have been given various names. As reported, murine VSELs have some pluripotent stem cell characteristics. Moreover, they display several epiblast/germline markers that suggest their embryonic origin and developmental deposition in adult BM. Moreover, at the molecular level, changes in expression of parentally imprinted genes (for example, Igf2–H19) and resistance to insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling (IIS) regulates their quiescent state in adult tissues. In several emergency situations related to organ damage, VSELs can be activated and mobilized into peripheral blood, and in appropriate animal models they contribute to tissue organ/regeneration. Interestingly, their number correlates with lifespan in mice, and they may also be involved in some malignancies. VSELs have been successfully isolated in several laboratories; however, some investigators experience problems with their isolation.","Ratajczak, M Z; Zuba-Surma, E; Wojakowski, W; Suszynska, M; Mierzejewska, K; Liu, R; Ratajczak, J; Shin, D M; Kucia, M",Leukemia,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3948156/,175
1418,Apoptotic Response through a High Mobility Box 1 Protein-Dependent Mechanism in LPS/GalN-Induced Mouse Liver Failure and Glycyrrhizin-Mediated Inhibition,2014-04-01,"HMGB1 is a nuclear component involved in nucleosome stabilization and transcription regulation, but extracellularly it is able to serve as a potential late mediator of lethality. In the present study, we explored inflammation-promoting activity of HMGB1 and blockade of extracellular release of HMGB1 by glycyrrhizin (GL) in LPS/GalN-triggered mouse liver injury. At 1 to 10 h after LPS/GalN-treatment, mice were anesthetized to collect blood from heart puncture, and serum transaminase and HMGB1 were evaluated. Administration of LPS/GalN precipitated tissue injury associated with time-dependent alteration in HMGB1 serum levels. At 8 h nuclear immunoreactive products were remarkably reduced and extracellular HMGB1 expression was found exclusively in the pericentral foci. The treatment with GL significantly down-regulated the serum levels of ALT, AST, and HMGB1 in addition to the strong inhibition of tissue injury and extracellular immunoreactivity to HMGB1 and to acetylated-lysine. Furthermore, GL brought about a significant decrease in the number of apoptotic hepatocytes labeled with TUNEL-method. On the basis of these results, three apoptosis-associated genes were identified with microarray analysis and real-time PCR. The ChIP-assay revealed the binding of HMGB1 protein to Gsto1 promoter sequence in LPS/GalN-treated mice and the remarkable decrease in combined HMGB1 protein by GL. The current findings claim that a single injection of LPS/GalN might stimulate apoptosis of hepatocytes through the binding of HMGB1 protein to Gsto1 promoter region and that GL-treatment might prevent the apoptosis and inflammatory infiltrates caused with LPS/GalN-injection by disturbing the binding of HMGB1 protein to Gsto1 promoter sequence.","Kuroda, Noriyuki; Inoue, Kouji; Ikeda, Tadayuki; Hara, Yaiko; Wake, Kenjiro; Sato, Tetsuji",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3972228/,175
1524,HIV-1 and Its gp120 Inhibits the Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 Life Cycle in an IFITM3-Dependent Fashion,2014-06-30,"HIV-1-infected patients co-infected with A(H1N1)pdm09 surprisingly presented benign clinical outcome. The knowledge that HIV-1 changes the host homeostatic equilibrium, which may favor the patient resistance to some co-pathogens, prompted us to investigate whether HIV-1 infection could influence A(H1N1)pdm09 life cycle in vitro. We show here that exposure of A(H1N1)pdm09-infected epithelial cells to HIV-1 viral particles or its gp120 enhanced by 25% the IFITM3 content, resulting in a decrease in influenza replication. This event was dependent on toll-like receptor 2 and 4. Moreover, knockdown of IFITM3 prevented HIV-1 ability to inhibit A(H1N1)pdm09 replication. HIV-1 infection also increased IFITM3 levels in human primary macrophages by almost 100%. Consequently, the arrival of influenza ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) to nucleus of macrophages was inhibited, as evaluated by different approaches. Reduction of influenza RNPs entry into the nucleus tolled A(H1N1)pdm09 life cycle in macrophages earlier than usual, limiting influenza's ability to induce TNF-α. As judged by analysis of the influenza hemagglutin (HA) gene from in vitro experiments and from samples of HIV-1/A(H1N1)pdm09 co-infected individuals, the HIV-1-induced reduction of influenza replication resulted in delayed viral evolution. Our results may provide insights on the mechanisms that may have attenuated the clinical course of Influenza in HIV-1/A(H1N1)pdm09 co-infected patients during the recent influenza form 2009/2010.","Mesquita, Milene; Fintelman-Rodrigues, Natalia; Sacramento, Carolina Q.; Abrantes, Juliana L.; Costa, Eduardo; Temerozo, Jairo R.; Siqueira, Marilda M.; Bou-Habib, Dumith Chequer; Souza, Thiago Moreno L.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4076258/,175
1635,Surfactant protein A genetic variants associate with severe respiratory insufficiency in pandemic influenza A virus infection,2014-06-20,"INTRODUCTION: Inherited variability in host immune responses influences susceptibility and outcome of Influenza A virus (IAV) infection, but these factors remain largely unknown. Components of the innate immune response may be crucial in the first days of the infection. The collectins surfactant protein (SP)-A1, -A2, and -D and mannose-binding lectin (MBL) neutralize IAV infectivity, although only SP-A2 can establish an efficient neutralization of poorly glycosylated pandemic IAV strains. METHODS: We studied the role of polymorphic variants at the genes of MBL (MBL2), SP-A1 (SFTPA1), SP-A2 (SFTPA2), and SP-D (SFTPD) in 93 patients with H1N1 pandemic 2009 (H1N1pdm) infection. RESULTS: Multivariate analysis showed that two frequent SFTPA2 missense alleles (rs1965708-C and rs1059046-A) and the SFTPA2 haplotype 1A(0) were associated with a need for mechanical ventilation, acute respiratory failure, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. The SFTPA2 haplotype 1A(1) was a protective variant. Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox regression also showed that diplotypes not containing the 1A(1) haplotype were associated with a significantly shorter time to ICU admission in hospitalized patients. In addition, rs1965708-C (P = 0.0007), rs1059046-A (P = 0.0007), and haplotype 1A(0) (P = 0.0004) were associated, in a dose-dependent fashion, with lower PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio, whereas haplotype 1A(1) was associated with a higher PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio (P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest an effect of genetic variants of SFTPA2 on the severity of H1N1pdm infection and could pave the way for a potential treatment with haplotype-specific (1A(1)) SP-A2 for future IAV pandemics.","Herrera-Ramos, Estefanía; López-Rodríguez, Marta; Ruíz-Hernández, José Juan; Horcajada, Juan Pablo; Borderías, Luis; Lerma, Elisabeth; Blanquer, José; Pérez-González, María Carmen; García-Laorden, María Isabel; Florido, Yanira; Mas-Bosch, Virginia; Montero, Milagro; Ferrer, José María; Sorlí, Luisa; Vilaplana, Carlos; Rajas, Olga; Briones, Marisa; Aspa, Javier; López-Granados, Eduardo; Solé-Violán, Jordi; de Castro, Felipe Rodríguez; Rodríguez-Gallego, Carlos",Crit Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4229788/,175
1720,Human Ebola virus infection in West Africa: a review of available therapeutic agents that target different steps of the life cycle of Ebola virus,2014-11-28,"The recent outbreak of the human Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV) epidemic is spiraling out of control in West Africa. Human EBOV hemorrhagic fever has a case fatality rate of up to 90%. The EBOV is classified as a biosafety level 4 pathogen and is considered a category A agent of bioterrorism by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, with no approved therapies and vaccines available for its treatment apart from supportive care. Although several promising therapeutic agents and vaccines against EBOV are undergoing the Phase I human trial, the current epidemic might be outpacing the speed at which drugs and vaccines can be produced. Like all viruses, the EBOV largely relies on host cell factors and physiological processes for its entry, replication, and egress. We have reviewed currently available therapeutic agents that have been shown to be effective in suppressing the proliferation of the EBOV in cell cultures or animal studies. Most of the therapeutic agents in this review are directed against non-mutable targets of the host, which is independent of viral mutation. These medications are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of other diseases. They are available and stockpileable for immediate use. They may also have a complementary role to those therapeutic agents under development that are directed against the mutable targets of the EBOV.

Neither vaccine nor effective antiviral therapy is available to prevent and treat RSV infection. Palivizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody, is the only product approved to prevent serious RSV infection, but its high cost is prohibitive in low-income countries. Here, we aimed to identify an effective, safe, and affordable antiviral agent for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) of RSV infection in children at high risk. We found that maleic anhydride (ML)-modified human serum albumin (HSA), designated ML-HSA, exhibited potent antiviral activity against RSV and that the percentages of the modified lysines and arginies in ML- are correlated with such anti-RSV activity. ML-HSA inhibited RSV entry and replication by interacting with viral G protein and blocking RSV attachment to the target cells, while ML-HAS neither bound to F protein, nor inhibited F protein-mediated membrane fusion. Intranasal administration of ML-HSA before RSV infection resulted in significant decrease of the viral titers in the lungs of mice. ML-HSA shows promise for further development into an effective, safe, affordable, and easy-to-use intranasal regimen for pre-exposure prophylaxis of RSV infection in children at high risk in both low- and high-income countries.","Sun, Zhiwu; Wang, Qian; Jia, Ran; Xia, Shuai; Li, Yuan; Liu, Qi; Xu, Wei; Xu, Jin; Du, Lanying; Lu, Lu; Jiang, Shibo",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4353917/,175
1805,Pseudotype-Based Neutralization Assays for Influenza: A Systematic Analysis,2015-04-29,"The use of vaccination against the influenza virus remains the most effective method of mitigating the significant morbidity and mortality caused by this virus. Antibodies elicited by currently licensed influenza vaccines are predominantly hemagglutination-inhibition (HI)-competent antibodies that target the globular head of hemagglutinin (HA) thus inhibiting influenza virus entry into target cells. These antibodies predominantly confer homosubtypic/strain specific protection and only rarely confer heterosubtypic protection. However, recent academia or pharma-led R&D toward the production of a “universal vaccine” has centered on the elicitation of antibodies directed against the stalk of the influenza HA that has been shown to confer broad protection across a range of different subtypes (H1–H16). The accurate and sensitive measurement of antibody responses elicited by these “next-generation” influenza vaccines is, however, hampered by the lack of sensitivity of the traditional influenza serological assays HI, single radial hemolysis, and microneutralization. Assays utilizing pseudotypes, chimeric viruses bearing influenza glycoproteins, have been shown to be highly efficient for the measurement of homosubtypic and heterosubtypic broadly neutralizing antibodies, making them ideal serological tools for the study of cross-protective responses against multiple influenza subtypes with pandemic potential. In this review, we will analyze and compare literature involving the production of influenza pseudotypes with particular emphasis on their use in serum antibody neutralization assays. This will enable us to establish the parameters required for optimization and propose a consensus protocol to be employed for the further deployment of these assays in influenza vaccine immunogenicity studies.","Carnell, George William; Ferrara, Francesca; Grehan, Keith; Thompson, Craig Peter; Temperton, Nigel James",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4413832/,175
1837,Interactions of Francisella tularensis with Alveolar Type II Epithelial Cells and the Murine Respiratory Epithelium,2015-05-26,"Francisella tularensis is classified as a Tier 1 select agent by the CDC due to its low infectious dose and the possibility that the organism can be used as a bioweapon. The low dose of infection suggests that Francisella is unusually efficient at evading host defenses. Although ~50 cfu are necessary to cause human respiratory infection, the early interactions of virulent Francisella with the lung environment are not well understood. To provide additional insights into these interactions during early Francisella infection of mice, we performed TEM analysis on mouse lungs infected with F. tularensis strains Schu S4, LVS and the O-antigen mutant Schu S4 waaY::TrgTn. For all three strains, the majority of the bacteria that we could detect were observed within alveolar type II epithelial cells at 16 hours post infection. Although there were no detectable differences in the amount of bacteria within an infected cell between the three strains, there was a significant increase in the amount of cellular debris observed in the air spaces of the lungs in the Schu S4 waaY::TrgTn mutant compared to either the Schu S4 or LVS strain. We also studied the interactions of Francisella strains with human AT-II cells in vitro by characterizing the ability of these three strains to invade and replicate within these cells. Gentamicin assay and confocal microscopy both confirmed that F. tularensis Schu S4 replicated robustly within these cells while F. tularensis LVS displayed significantly lower levels of growth over 24 hours, although the strain was able to enter these cells at about the same level as Schu S4 (1 organism per cell), as determined by confocal imaging. The Schu S4 waaY::TrgTn mutant that we have previously described as attenuated for growth in macrophages and mouse virulence displayed interesting properties as well. This mutant induced significant airway inflammation (cell debris) and had an attenuated growth phenotype in the human AT-II cells. These data extend our understanding of early Francisella infection by demonstrating that Francisella enter significant numbers of AT-II cells within the lung and that the capsule and LPS of wild type Schu S4 helps prevent murine lung damage during infection. Furthermore, our data identified that human AT-II cells allow growth of Schu S4, but these same cells supported poor growth of the attenuated LVS strain in vitro. Collectively, these data further our understanding of the role of AT-II cells in Francisella infections.","Faron, Matthew; Fletcher, Joshua R.; Rasmussen, Jed A.; Apicella, Michael A.; Jones, Bradley D.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4444194/,175
1876,Experimental African Trypanosome Infection by Needle Passage or Natural Tsetse Fly Challenge Thwarts the Development of Collagen-Induced Arthritis in DBA/1 Prone Mice via an Impairment of Antigen Specific B Cell Autoantibody Titers,2015-06-25,"Collagen-induced arthritis is a B cell-mediated autoimmune disease. Recently published studies have demonstrated that in some rare cases pathogens can confer protection from autoimmunity. Trypanosoma brucei parasites are tsetse fly transmitted extracellular protozoans causing sleeping sickness disease in humans and Nagana in livestock in sub-Saharan endemic areas. In the past, we demonstrated that trypanosome infections impair B cell homeostasis and abolish vaccine-induced protection against unrelated antigens. Hence, here we hypothesized that trypanosome infection can affect the onset of CIA by specifically dampening specific B-cell responses and type II collagen antibody titers in DBA/1 prone mice. We observed a substantial delay in the onset of collagen-induced arthritis in T. brucei-infected DBA/1 mice that correlates with a drastic decrease of type II collagen titers of the different IgG isotypes in the serum. Treatment of infected mice with Berenil, a trypanocidal drug, restored the development of CIA-associated clinical symptoms. Interestingly, these data were confirmed by the challenge of immunized DBA/1 prone mice with T. brucei-infected tsetse flies. Together, these results demonstrate that T. brucei infection is impairing the maintenance of the antigen specific plasma B cell pool driving the development of CIA in DBA/1 prone mice.","De Trez, Carl; Katsandegwaza, Brunette; Caljon, Guy; Magez, Stefan",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4482398/,175
1957,Vaccine Induced Herd Immunity for Control of Respiratory Syncytial Virus Disease in a Low-Income Country Setting,2015-09-21,"BACKGROUND: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is globally ubiquitous, and infection during the first six months of life is a major risk for severe disease and hospital admission; consequently RSV is the most important viral cause of respiratory morbidity and mortality in young children. Development of vaccines for young infants is complicated by the presence of maternal antibodies and immunological immaturity, but vaccines targeted at older children avoid these problems. Vaccine development for young infants has been unsuccessful, but this is not the case for older children (> 6m). Would vaccinating older children have a significant public health impact? We developed a mathematical model to explore the benefits of a vaccine against RSV. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We have used a deterministic age structured model capturing the key epidemiological characteristics of RSV and performed a statistical maximum-likelihood fit to age-specific hospitalization data from a developing country setting. To explore the effects of vaccination under different mixing assumptions, we included two versions of contact matrices: one from a social contact diary study, and the second a synthesised construction based on demographic data. Vaccination is assumed to elicit an immune response equivalent to primary infection. Our results show that immunisation of young children (5–10m) is likely to be a highly effective method of protection of infants (<6m) against hospitalisation. The majority benefit is derived from indirect protection (herd immunity). A full sensitivity and uncertainty analysis using Latin Hypercube Sampling of the parameter space shows that our results are robust to model structure and model parameters. CONCLUSIONS: This result suggests that vaccinating older infants and children against RSV can have a major public health benefit.","Kinyanjui, Timothy M.; House, Thomas A.; Kiti, Moses C.; Cane, Patricia A.; Nokes, David J.; Medley, Graham F.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4577090/,175

2099,Construction of the influenza A virus transmission tree in a college-based population: co-transmission and interactions between influenza A viruses,2016-01-29,"BACKGROUND: Co-infection of different influenza A viruses is known to occur but how viruses interact within co-infection remains unknown. An outbreak in a college campus during the 2009 pandemic involved two subtypes of influenza A: persons infected with pandemic A/H1N1; persons infected with seasonal A/H3N2 viruses; and persons infected with both at the same time (co-infection). This provides data to analyse the possible interaction between influenza A viruses within co-infection. METHODS: We extend a statistical inference method designed for outbreaks caused by one virus to that caused by two viruses. The method uses knowledge of which subtype each case is infected with (and whether they were co-infected), contact information and symptom onset date of each case in the influenza outbreak. We then apply it to construct the most likely transmission tree during the outbreak in the college campus. RESULTS: Analysis of the constructed transmission tree shows that the simultaneous presence of the two influenza viruses increases the infectivity and the transmissibility of A/H1N1 virus but whether it changes the infectivity of A/H3N2 is unclear. The estimation also shows that co-transmission of both subtypes from co-infection is low and therefore co-infection cannot be sustained on its own. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that influenza A viruses within co-infected patients can interact in some ways rather than transmit independently, and this can enhance the spread of influenza A virus infection.

2111,Evaluation of twenty‐two rapid antigen detection tests in the diagnosis of Equine Influenza caused by viruses of H3N8 subtype,2016-02-01,"BACKGROUND: Equine influenza (EI) is a highly contagious disease caused by viruses of the H3N8 subtype. The rapid diagnosis of EI is essential to reduce the disease spread. Many rapid antigen detection (RAD) tests for diagnosing human influenza are available, but their ability to diagnose EI has not been systematically evaluated. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to compare the performance of 22 RAD tests in the diagnosis of EI. METHODS: The 22 RAD tests were performed on fivefold serial dilutions of EI virus to determine their detection limits. The four most sensitive RAD tests (ImmunoAce Flu, BD Flu examan, Quick chaser Flu A, B and ESPLINE Influenza A&B‐N) were further evaluated using nasopharyngeal samples collected from experimentally infected and naturally infected horses. The results were compared to those obtained using molecular tests. RESULTS: The detection limits of the 22 RAD tests varied hugely. Even the four RAD tests showing the best sensitivity were 125‐fold less sensitive than the molecular techniques. The duration of virus detection in the experimentally infected horses was shorter using the RAD tests than using the molecular techniques. The RAD tests detected between 27% and 73% of real‐time RT‐PCR‐positive samples from naturally infected horses. CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrated the importance of choosing the right RAD tests as only three of 22 were fit for diagnosing EI. It was also indicated that even RAD tests with the highest sensitivity serve only as an adjunct to molecular tests because of the potential for false‐negative results.","Yamanaka, Takashi; Nemoto, Manabu; Bannai, Hiroshi; Tsujimura, Koji; Kondo, Takashi; Matsumura, Tomio; Gildea, Sarah; Cullinane, Ann",Influenza Other Respir Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4746556/,175

Previous studies have described the pleiotropic role of type I IFNs on innate and adaptive immune cells during viral infection. Here, we demonstrate that natural killer (NK) cells from mice lacking the type I IFN-α receptor (Ifnar(−/−)) or STAT1 (which signals downstream of IFNAR) are defective in expansion and memory cell formation after mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection. Despite comparable proliferation, Ifnar(−/−) NK cells showed diminished protection against MCMV infection and exhibited more apoptosis compared with wild-type NK cells. Furthermore, we show that Ifnar(−/−) NK cells express increased levels of NK group 2 member D (NKG2D) ligands during viral infection and are susceptible to NK cell–mediated fratricide in a perforin- and NKG2D-dependent manner. Adoptive transfer of Ifnar(−/−) NK cells into NK cell–deficient mice reverses the defect in survival and expansion. Our study reveals a novel type I IFN–dependent mechanism by which NK cells evade mechanisms of cell death after viral infection.","Madera, Sharline; Rapp, Moritz; Firth, Matthew A.; Beilke, Joshua N.; Lanier, Lewis L.; Sun, Joseph C.",J Exp Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4749923/,175

However the rate of occult bacteremia in infants with RSV infection is not well established. The aim was to determine the actual rate and predictive factors of bacteremia in children admitted to hospital due to confirmed RSV acute respiratory illness (ARI), using both conventional culture and molecular techniques. METHODS: A prospective multicenter study (GENDRES-network) was conducted between 2011–2013 in children under the age of two admitted to hospital because of an ARI. Among those RSV-positive, bacterial presence in blood was assessed using PCR for Meningococcus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus, in addition to conventional cultures. RESULTS: 66 children with positive RSV respiratory illness were included. In 10.6% patients, bacterial presence was detected: H. influenzae (n = 4) and S. pneumoniae (n = 2). In those patients with bacteremia, there was a previous suspicion of bacterial superinfection and had received empirical antibiotic treatment 6 out of 7 (85.7%) patients. There were significant differences in terms of severity between children with positive bacterial PCR and those with negative results: PICU admission (100% vs. 50%, P-value = 0.015); respiratory support necessity (100% vs. 18.6%, P-value < 0.001); Wood-Downes score (mean = 8.7 vs. 4.8 points, P-value < 0.001); GENVIP scale (mean = 17 vs. 10.1, P-value < 0.001); and length of hospitalization (mean = 12.1 vs. 7.5 days, P-value = 0.007).

This paper shows a loss in efficiency of the movement restriction policy (MRP) when behavioral responses of farmers are taken into account. Incorporating the strategic behavior of farmers in an epidemiologic model reveals that the MRP can trigger premature animal sales by farms at high risk of becoming infected that significantly reduce the efficacy of the policy. The results are validated in a parameterized network via Monte Carlo simulations and measures to mitigate the loss of efficiency of the MRP are discussed. Financial aid to farmers can be justified by public health concerns, not only for equity.

Mice were exposed to a single or repeated dose of PM, after which the expression of toll-like receptors (TLRs), cytokines, and chemokines in the lungs of infected mice were examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and histopathological analysis. Results after single and repeated PM stimulation with [Formula: see text] indicated that TLR2 and TLR4 played a dominant role in the inflammatory responses of the lung. Further analysis demonstrated that the expression levels of IL-1β, TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-8, IP-10, and MCP-1 increased significantly, which could eventually contribute to lung injury. Moreover, biological components in PM were critical in mediating immune-related inflammatory responses and should therefore not be overlooked.","Meng, Kai; Wu, Bo; Gao, Jing; Cai, Yumei; Yao, Meiling; Wei, Liangmeng; Chai, Tongjie",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4921493/,175
2285,Acquisition of tumorigenic potential and enhancement of angiogenesis in pulmonary stem/progenitor cells through Oct-4 hyperexpression,2016-02-09,"Cancer stem cells, also known as cancer initiating cells (CICs), are considered to be responsible for tumor growth and chemoresistance. Different hypotheses have been proposed to explain the origin of CICs, including mutations in adult stem/progenitor cells or the acquisition of stem-like characteristics in differentiated cells; however, studies have yielded conflicting identification for CICs and have little information for the origin to generate CICs. Part of the difficulty in identifying CICs may stem from the fact that the CICs studied have been largely derived from cancer cell lines or well-developed tumors. In previous studies, we have reported the enrichment of mouse pulmonary stem/progenitor cells (mPSCs) by using serum-free primary selection culture followed by FACS isolation using the coxsackievirus/adenovirus receptor (CAR) as the positive selection marker. Here, we demonstrated that overexpression of the pluripotent transcription factor Oct-4 is sufficient to induce CAR(+)/mPSCs transformation, which we name CAR(+)/mPSCs(Oct-4_hi). These transformed cells possess cancer initiating and chemoresistance potential, as well as exhibiting remarkable expression of certain proangiogenic factors, including angiopoietins (ANGs) and VEGF, and enhanced angiogenic potential. Moreover, CAR(+)/mPSCs(Oct-4_hi) actively participated in tumor blood vessel formation and triggered a novel angiogenic mechanism, the angiopoietins/Tie2 signaling pathway.

In vitro CHIKV infection was also shown to stimulate MCP-1 production in whole blood; yet the role and the mechanism of MCP-1 production upon infection of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells remain unknown. Here we found that active CHIKV infection stimulated production of MCP-1 in monocytes. Importantly however, we found that communication with other leukocytes is crucial to yield MCP-1 by monocytes upon CHIKV infection. Indeed, blocking interferon-α/β receptor or the JAK1/JAK2 signalling downstream of the receptor abolished CHIKV-mediated MCP-1 production. Additionally, we show that despite the apparent correlation between IFN type I, CHIKV replication and MCP-1, modulating the levels of the chemokine did not influence CHIKV infection. In summary, our data disclose the complexity of MCP-1 regulation upon CHIKV infection and point to a crucial role of IFNβ in the chemokine secretion. We propose that balance between these soluble factors is imperative for an appropriate host response to CHIKV infection.","Ruiz Silva, Mariana; van der Ende-Metselaar, Heidi; Mulder, H.

2456,Mesenchymal stromal cell treatment prevents H9N2 avian influenza virus-induced acute lung injury in mice,2016-10-28,"BACKGROUND: The avian influenza virus (AIV) can cross species barriers and expand its host range from birds to mammals, even humans. Avian influenza is characterized by pronounced activation of the proinflammatory cytokine cascade, which perpetuates the inflammatory response, leading to persistent systemic inflammatory response syndrome and pulmonary infection in animals and humans. There are currently no specific treatment strategies for avian influenza. METHODS: We hypothesized that mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) would have beneficial effects in the treatment of H9N2 AIV-induced acute lung injury in mice. Six- to 8-week-old C57BL/6 mice were infected intranasally with 1 × 10(4) MID(50) of A/HONG KONG/2108/2003 [H9N2 (HK)] H9N2 virus to induce acute lung injury. After 30 min, syngeneic MSCs were delivered through the caudal vein. Three days after infection, we measured the survival rate, lung weight, arterial blood gas, and cytokines in both bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and serum, and assessed pathological changes to the lungs. RESULTS: MSC administration significantly palliated H9N2 AIV-induced pulmonary inflammation by reducing chemokines and proinflammatory cytokines levels, as well as reducing inflammatory cell recruit into the lungs. Thus, H9N2 AIV-induced lung injury was markedly alleviated in mice treated with MSCs. Lung histopathology and arterial blood gas analysis were improved in mice with H9N2 AIV-induced lung injury following MSC treatment. CONCLUSIONS: MSC treatment significantly reduces H9N2 AIV-induced acute lung injury in mice and is associated with reduced pulmonary inflammation. These results indicate a potential role for MSC therapy in the treatment of clinical avian influenza.","Li, Yan; Xu, Jun; Shi, Weiqing; Chen, Cheng; Shao, Yan; Zhu, Limei; Lu, Wei; Han, XiaoDong",Stem Cell Res Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5084318/,175
2564,Evaluation of TaqMan qPCR System Integrating Two Identically Labelled Hydrolysis Probes in Single Assay,2017-01-25,"Ongoing evolution of viral pathogens is a significant issue in diagnostic virology employing TaqMan qPCR/RT-qPCR. Specific concerns are related to false negativity due to probe binding failure. One option for compensating for such deficiency is to integrate a second identically labelled probe in the assay. However, how this alteration influences the reaction parameters has not been comprehensively demonstrated. In the present study, we evaluate a TaqMan protocol using two identically labelled hydrolysis probes (simple, LNA (locked-nucleic-acid)) and MGB (minor-groove-binder) modified probes and combinations thereof in a single assay. Our results based on a synthetic amplicon suggest that the second probe does not compromise the TaqMan qPCR/RT-qPCR parameters, which repeatedly and reproducibly remained comparable to those of the corresponding single-probe assays, irrespective of the relative probe orientation, whether opposite or tandem, and probe modifications or combinations thereof. On the other hand, the second probe additively contributed to the overall fluorescence signal. The utility of the dual-probe approach was demonstrated on practical examples by using field specimens. We hope that the present study might serve as a theoretical basis for the development or improvement of TaqMan qPCR/RT-qPCR assays for the detection of highly variable nucleic acid templates.","Nagy, Alexander; Vitásková, Eliška; Černíková, Lenka; Křivda, Vlastimil; Jiřincová, Helena; Sedlák, Kamil; Horníčková, Jitka; Havlíčková, Martina",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5264587/,175

Promising results have been reported for recombinant angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein administration in experimental liver and lung fibrosis. However, the full potential of ACE2 may be achieved by localized translation of a membrane-anchored form. For this purpose, we advanced the latest RNA technology for liver- and lung-targeted ACE2 translation. We demonstrated in vitro that transfection with ACE2 chemically modified messenger RNA (cmRNA) leads to robust translation of fully matured, membrane-anchored ACE2 protein. In a second step, we designed eight modified ACE2 cmRNA sequences and identified a lead sequence for in vivo application. Finally, formulation of this ACE2 cmRNA in tailor-made lipidoid nanoparticles and in lipid nanoparticles led to liver- and lung-targeted translation of significant amounts of ACE2 protein, respectively. In summary, we provide evidence that RNA transcript therapy (RTT) is a promising approach for ACE2-based treatment of liver and lung fibrosis to be tested in fibrotic disease models.","Schrom, Eva; Huber, Maja; Aneja, Manish; Dohmen, Christian; Emrich, Daniela; Geiger, Johannes; Hasenpusch, Günther; Herrmann-Janson, Annika; Kretzschmann, Verena; Mykhailyk, Olga; Pasewald, Tamara; Oak, Prajakta; Hilgendorff, Anne; Wohlleber, Dirk; Hoymann, Heinz-Gerd; Schaudien, Dirk; Plank, Christian; Rudolph, Carsten; Kubisch-Dohmen, Rebekka",Mol Ther Nucleic Acids,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5423349/,175
2797,Multimechanistic Monoclonal Antibodies (MAbs) Targeting Staphylococcus aureus Alpha-Toxin and Clumping Factor A: Activity and Efficacy Comparisons of a MAb Combination and an Engineered Bispecific Antibody Approach,2017-07-25,"Secreted alpha-toxin and surface-localized clumping factor A (ClfA) are key virulence determinants in Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections. We previously demonstrated that prophylaxis with a multimechanistic monoclonal antibody (MAb) combination against alpha-toxin (MEDI4893*) and ClfA (11H10) provided greater strain coverage and improved efficacy in an S. aureus lethal bacteremia model. Subsequently, 11H10 was found to exhibit reduced affinity and impaired inhibition of fibrinogen binding to ClfA002 expressed by members of a predominant hospital-associated methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) clone, ST5. Consequently, we identified another anti-ClfA MAb (SAR114) from human tonsillar B cells with >100-fold increased affinity for three prominent ClfA variants, including ClfA002, and potent inhibition of bacterial agglutination by 112 diverse clinical isolates. We next constructed bispecific Abs (BiSAbs) comprised of 11H10 or SAR114 as IgG scaffolds and grafted anti-alpha-toxin (MEDI4893*) single-chain variable fragment to the amino or carboxy terminus of the anti-ClfA heavy chains. Although the BiSAbs exhibited in vitro potencies similar to those of the parental MAbs, only 11H10-BiSAb, but not SAR114-BiSAb, showed protective activity in murine infection models comparable to the respective MAb combination. In vivo activity with SAR114-BiSAb was observed in infection models with S. aureus lacking ClfA. Our data suggest that high-affinity binding to ClfA sequesters the SAR114-BiSAb to the bacterial surface, thereby reducing both alpha-toxin neutralization and protection in vivo. These results indicate that a MAb combination targeting ClfA and alpha-toxin is more promising for future development than the corresponding BiSAb.","Tkaczyk, C.; Kasturirangan, S.; Minola, A.; Jones-Nelson, O.; Gunter, V.; Shi, Y.

A country's ability to robustly detect ZIKV introduction and local transmission is important to minimise the risk for a ZIKV outbreak. Therefore, sufficient expertise and diagnostic capacity and capability are required in European laboratories. To assess the capacity, quality, operational specifics (guidelines and algorithms), technical and interpretation issues and other possible difficulties that were related to ZIKV diagnostics in European countries, a questionnaire was conducted among national reference laboratories in 30 countries in the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) in May 2016. While the coverage and capacity of ZIKV diagnostics in the EU/EEA national reference laboratories were found to be adequate, the assessment of the quality and needs indicated several crucial points of improvement that will need support at national and EU/EEA level to improve ZIKV preparedness, response and EU/EEA ZIKV surveillance activities.","Mögling, Ramona; Zeller, Hervé; Revez, Joana; Koopmans, Marion; Reusken, Chantal",Euro Surveill,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5685210/,175
2979,Port d’Entrée for Respiratory Infections – Does the Influenza A Virus Pave the Way for Bacteria?,2017-12-21,"Bacterial and viral co-infections of the respiratory tract are life-threatening and present a global burden to the global community. Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes are frequent colonizers of the upper respiratory tract. Imbalances through acquisition of seasonal viruses, e.g., Influenza A virus, can lead to bacterial dissemination to the lower respiratory tract, which in turn can result in severe pneumonia. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge about bacterial and viral co-infections of the respiratory tract and focus on potential experimental models suitable for mimicking this disease. Transmission of IAV and pneumonia is mainly modeled by mouse infection. Few studies utilizing ferrets, rats, guinea pigs, rabbits, and non-human primates are also available. The knowledge gained from these studies led to important discoveries and advances in understanding these infectious diseases. Nevertheless, mouse and other infection models have limitations, especially in translation of the discoveries to humans. Here, we suggest the use of human engineered lung tissue, human ex vivo lung tissue, and porcine models to study respiratory co-infections, which might contribute to a greater translation of the results to humans and improve both, animal and human health.","Siemens, Nikolai; Oehmcke-Hecht, Sonja; Mettenleiter, Thomas C.; Kreikemeyer, Bernd; Valentin-Weigand, Peter; Hammerschmidt, Sven",Front Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5742597/,175
3141,Modulating Metabolism to Improve Cancer-Induced Muscle Wasting,2018-01-29,"Muscle wasting is one of the main features of cancer cachexia, a multifactorial syndrome frequently occurring in oncologic patients. The onset of cachexia is associated with reduced tolerance and response to antineoplastic treatments, eventually leading to clinical conditions that are not compatible with survival. Among the mechanisms underlying cachexia, protein and energy dysmetabolism play a major role. In this regard, several potential treatments have been proposed, mainly on the basis of promising results obtained in preclinical models. However, at present, no treatment yet reached validation to be used in the clinical practice, although several drugs are currently tested in clinical trials for their ability to improve muscle metabolism in cancer patients. Along this line, the results obtained in both experimental and clinical studies clearly show that cachexia can be effectively approached by a multidirectional strategy targeting nutrition, inflammation, catabolism, and inactivity at the same time. In the present study, approaches aimed to modulate muscle metabolism in cachexia will be reviewed.","Penna, Fabio; Ballarò, Riccardo; Beltrá, Marc; De Lucia, Serena; Costelli, Paola",Oxid Med Cell Longev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5896402/,175

Recently, mitochondrial transfer from stem cells has been demonstrated to play a significant role in rescuing injured tissues. The possible mechanisms of mitochondria released from stem cells, the pathways of mitochondria transfer between the donor stem cells and recipient cells, and the internalization of mitochondria into recipient cells are discussed. Moreover, a novel strategy for tissue injury based on the concept of stem cell-derived mitochondrial transplantation is pointed out, and the advantages and challenges are summarized.","Wang, Jingyu; Li, Heyangzi; Yao, Ying; Zhao, Tengfei; Chen, Ying-ying; Shen, Yue-liang; Wang, Lin-lin; Zhu, Yongjian",Stem Cell Res Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5899391/,175
3157,Volatile fingerprinting of human respiratory viruses from cell culture,2018-03-01,"Volatile metabolites are currently under investigation as potential biomarkers for the detection and identification of pathogenic microorganisms, including bacteria, fungi, and viruses. Unlike bacteria and fungi, which produce distinct volatile metabolic signatures associated with innate differences in both primary and secondary metabolic processes, viruses are wholly reliant on the metabolic machinery of infected cells for replication and propagation. In the present study, the ability of volatile metabolites to discriminate between respiratory cells infected and uninfected with virus, in vitro, was investigated. Two important respiratory viruses, namely respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza A virus (IAV), were evaluated. Data were analyzed using three different machine learning algorithms (random forest (RF), linear support vector machines (linear SVM), and partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA)), with volatile metabolites identified from a training set used to predict sample classifications in a validation set. The discriminatory performances of RF, linear SVM, and PLS-DA were comparable for the comparison of IAV-infected versus uninfected cells, with area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROCs) between 0.78 and 0.82, while RF and linear SVM demonstrated superior performance in the classification of RSV-infected versus uninfected cells (AUROCs between 0.80 and 0.84) relative to PLS-DA (0.61). A subset of discriminatory features were assigned putative compound identifications, with an overabundance of hydrocarbons observed in both RSV- and IAV-infected cell cultures relative to uninfected controls. This finding is consistent with increased oxidative stress, a process associated with viral infection of respiratory cells.","Purcaro, Giorgia; Rees, Christiaan A; Wieland-Alter, Wendy F; Schneider, Mark J; Wang, Xi; Stefanuto, Pierre-Hugues; Wright, Peter F; Enelow, Richard I; Hill, Jane E",J Breath Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5912890/,175
3264,"Kynurenic acid, an IDO metabolite, controls TSG-6-mediated immunosuppression of human mesenchymal stem cells",2017-12-13,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been demonstrated to be anti-inflammatory against various immune disorders through several factors, including indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) and TNF-stimulated gene 6 (TSG-6). However, little is known about the necessity for both of these key immunosuppressive factors. Here we employed the mouse lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung injury (ALI) model, and found that IDO is necessary to achieve the effect of human umbilical cord-derived MSC (hUC-MSC)-based treatment on ALI. Notably, when IDO was deleted or inhibited, the expression of TSG-6 was decreased. This specific IDO-mediated regulation of TSG-6 expression was found to be exerted through its metabolite, kynurenic acid (KYNA), as inhibition of KYNA production led to decreased TSG-6 expression. Importantly, KYNA pretreatment of human MSCs enhanced their therapeutic effect on ALI. Mechanistically, KYNA activates aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), which directly binds to the TSG-6 promoter to enhance TSG-6 expression. Therefore, our study has uncovered a novel link between IDO and TSG-6, and demonstrates that a metabolite of IDO controls the TSG-6-mediated anti-inflammatory therapeutic effects of human MSCs.","Wang, Guan; Cao, Kai; Liu, Keli; Xue, Yueqing; Roberts, Arthur I.; Li, Fengying; Han, Yanyan; Rabson, Arnold B.; Wang, Ying; Shi, Yufang",Cell Death Differ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6030103/,175
3552,Atg5 Supports Rickettsia australis Infection in Macrophages In Vitro and In Vivo,2018-12-19,"Rickettsiae can cause life-threatening infections in humans. Macrophages are one of the initial targets for rickettsiae after inoculation by ticks. However, it remains poorly understood how rickettsiae remain free in macrophages prior to establishing their infection in microvascular endothelial cells. Here, we demonstrated that the concentration of Rickettsia australis was significantly greater in infected tissues of Atg5(flox/flox) mice than in the counterparts of Atg5(flox/flox) Lyz-Cre mice, in association with a reduced level of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) in serum. The greater concentration of R. australis in Atg5(flox/flox) bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) than in Atg5(flox/flox) Lyz-Cre BMMs in vitro was abolished by exogenous treatment with recombinant IL-1β. Rickettsia australis induced significantly increased levels of light chain 3 (LC3) form II (LC3-II) and LC3 puncta in Atg5-competent BMMs but not in Atg5-deficient BMMs, while no p62 turnover was observed. Further analysis found the colocalization of LC3 with a small portion of R. australis and Rickettsia-containing double-membrane-bound vacuoles in the BMMs of B6 mice. Moreover, treatment with rapamycin significantly increased the concentrations of R. australis in B6 BMMs compared to those in the untreated B6 BMM controls. Taken together, our results demonstrate that Atg5 favors R. australis infection in mouse macrophages in association with a suppressed level of IL-1β production but not active autophagy flux. These data highlight the contribution of Atg5 in macrophages to the pathogenesis of rickettsial diseases.","Bechelli, Jeremy; Vergara, Leoncio; Smalley, Claire; Buzhdygan, Tetyana P.; Bender, Sean; Zhang, William; Liu, Yan; Popov, Vsevolod L.; Wang, Jin; Garg, Nisha; Hwang, Seungmin; Walker, David H.; Fang, Rong",Infect Immun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6300621/,175
3695,"Influenza C virus in pre-school children with respiratory infections: retrospective analysis of data from the national influenza surveillance system in Germany, 2012 to 2014",2019-03-07,"INTRODUCTION: Recent data on influenza C virus indicate a possible higher clinical impact in specified patient populations than previously thought. AIM: We aimed to investigate influenza C virus circulation in Germany. METHODS: A total of 1,588 samples from 0 to 4 year-old children presenting as outpatients with influenza-like illness (ILI) or acute respiratory infection were analysed retrospectively. The samples represented a subset of all samples from the German national surveillance system for influenza in this age group in 2012–14. The presence of influenza C virus was investigated by real-time PCR. For positive samples, information on symptoms as well as other respiratory virus co-infections was considered. Retrieved influenza C viral sequences were phylogenetically characterised. RESULTS: Influenza C viral RNA was detected in 20 (1.3% of) samples, including 16 during the 2012/13 season. The majority (18/20) of influenza C-positive patients had ILI according to the European Union definition, one patient had pneumonia. Viruses belonged to the C/Sao Paulo and C/Kanagawa lineages. Most (11/20) samples were co-infected with other respiratory viruses. CONCLUSION: Our data are the first on influenza C virus circulation in Germany and notably from a European national surveillance system. The low detection frequency and the identified virus variants confirm earlier observations outside a surveillance system. More virus detections during the 2012/13 season indicate a variable circulation intensity in the different years studied. Influenza C virus can be considered for ILI patients. Future studies addressing its clinical impact, especially in patients with severe disease are needed.","Fritsch, Annemarie; Schweiger, Brunhilde; Biere, Barbara",Euro Surveill,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6415498/,175

Previously, we reported that N-sulfonated derivatives of poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (NSPAHs) efficiently inhibit replication of the influenza virus in vitro and ex vivo. Here, we show a dose dependent inhibition of hMPV infection by NSPAHs in LLC-MK2 cells. The results showed strong antiviral properties of NSPAHs. While the activity of NSPAHs is comparable to those of carrageenans, they show better physicochemical properties and may be delivered at high concentrations. The functional assays showed that tested polymers block hMPV release from infected cells and, consequently, constrain virus spread. Moreover, further studies on viruses utilizing different egress mechanisms suggest that observed antiviral effect depend on selective inhibition of viruses budding from the cell surface.","Ciejka, Justyna; Botwina, Paweł; Nowakowska, Maria; Szczubiałka, Krzysztof; Pyrc, Krzysztof",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6438514/,175

3853,Distal airway stem cells ameliorate bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice,2019-06-03,"BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is characterized by loss of lung epithelial cells and inexorable progression of fibrosis with no effective and approved treatments. The distal airway stem/progenitor cells (DASCs) have been shown to have potent regenerative capacity after lung injury. In this work, we aimed to define the role of mouse DASCs (mDASCs) in response to bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis in mice. METHODS: The mDASCs were isolated, expanded in vitro, and labeled with GFP by lentiviral infection. The labeled mDASCs were intratracheally instilled into bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis mice on day 7. Pathological change, collagen content, α-SMA expression, lung function, and mortality rate were assessed at 7, 14, and 21 days after bleomycin administration. Tissue section and direct fluorescence staining was used to show the distribution and differentiation of mDASCs in lung. RESULTS: The transplanted mDASCs could incorporate, proliferate, and differentiate into type I pneumocytes in bleomycin-injured lung. They also inhibited fibrogenesis by attenuating the deposition of collagen and expression of α-SMA. In addition, mDASCs improved pulmonary function and reduce mortality in bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis mice. CONCLUSIONS: The data strongly suggest that mDASCs could ameliorate bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis by promotion of lung regeneration and inhibition of lung fibrogenesis.

3993,Central Nervous System Inflammatory Aggregates in the Theiler's Virus Model of Progressive Multiple Sclerosis,2019-08-02,"Persistent central nervous system (CNS) inflammation, as seen in chronic infections or inflammatory demyelinating diseases such as Multiple Sclerosis (MS), results in the accumulation of various B cell subsets in the CNS, including naïve, activated, memory B cells (Bmem), and antibody secreting cells (ASC). However, factors driving heterogeneous B cell subset accumulation and antibody (Ab) production in the CNS compartment, including the contribution of ectopic lymphoid follicles (ELF), during chronic CNS inflammation remain unclear and is a major gap in our understanding of neuroinflammation. We sought to address this gap using the Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus-induced demyelinating disease (TMEV-IDD) model of progressive MS. In this model, injection of the virus into susceptible mouse strains results in a persistent infection associated with demyelination and progressive disability. During chronic infection, the predominant B cell phenotypes accumulating in the CNS were isotype-switched B cells, including Bmem and ASC with naïve/early activated and transitional B cells present at low frequencies. B cell accumulation in the CNS during chronic TMEV-IDD coincided with intrathecal Ab synthesis in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Mature and isotype-switched B cells predominately localized to the meninges and perivascular space, with IgG isotype-switched B cells frequently accumulating in the parenchymal space. Both mature and isotype-switched B cells and T cells occupied meningeal and perivascular spaces, with minimal evidence for spatial organization typical of ELF mimicking secondary lymphoid organs (SLO). Moreover, immunohistological analysis of immune cell aggregates revealed a lack of SLO-like ELF features, such as cell proliferation, cell death, and germinal center B cell markers. Nonetheless, flow cytometric assessment of B cells within the CNS showed enhanced expression of activation markers, including moderate upregulation of GL7 and expression of the costimulatory molecule CD80. B cell-related chemokines and trophic factors, including APRIL, BAFF, CXCL9, CXCL10, CCL19, and CXCL13, were elevated in the CNS. These results indicate that localization of heterogeneous B cell populations, including activated and isotype-switched B cell phenotypes, to the CNS and intrathecal Ab (ItAb) synthesis can occur independently of SLO-like follicles during chronic inflammatory demyelinating disease.","DiSano, Krista D.; Royce, Darlene B.; Gilli, Francesca; Pachner, Andrew R.",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6687912/,175
4041,Host susceptibility to severe influenza A virus infection,2019-09-05,"Most people exposed to a new flu virus do not notice any symptoms. A small minority develops critical illness. Some of this extremely broad variation in susceptibility is explained by the size of the initial inoculum or the influenza exposure history of the individual; some is explained by generic host factors, such as frailty, that decrease resilience following any systemic insult. Some demographic factors (pregnancy, obesity, and advanced age) appear to confer a more specific susceptibility to severe illness following infection with influenza viruses. As with other infectious diseases, a substantial component of susceptibility is determined by host genetics. Several genetic susceptibility variants have now been reported with varying levels of evidence. Susceptible hosts may have impaired intracellular controls of viral replication (e.g. IFITM3, TMPRS22 variants), defective interferon responses (e.g. GLDC, IRF7/9 variants), or defects in cell-mediated immunity with increased baseline levels of systemic inflammation (obesity, pregnancy, advanced age). These mechanisms may explain the prolonged viral replication reported in critically ill patients with influenza: patients with life-threatening disease are, by definition, abnormal hosts. Understanding these molecular mechanisms of susceptibility may in the future enable the design of host-directed therapies to promote resilience.","Clohisey, Sara; Baillie, John Kenneth",Crit Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6729070/,175

METHODS: We employed solid phase immunoassay techniques to measure immunoglobulin G (IgG) class antibodies to EBV virions and defined proteins in 432 individuals with schizophrenia and 311 individuals without a history of a psychiatric disorder. Western blot testing was performed to document reactivity to specific EBV proteins. Polygenic risk for schizophrenia was calculated from genome sequencing arrays. Levels of antibodies between the groups were compared by multivariate analyses incorporating clinical, genetic, and demographic measures. RESULTS: Individuals with schizophrenia had marked elevations in the levels of antibodies to EBV virions as compared to the control population. Further analyses indicated increased levels of reactivity to EBV-viral capsid antibody (VCA) but not to EBV nuclear antigen-1 (EBNA-1) or to other human herpesviruses. Western blot analysis confirmed increased reactivity to VCA proteins in the group of individuals with schizophrenia and documented a lack of increased levels of antibodies to EBNA-1. Genetic analyses indicated an additive effect of increased levels of antibodies to EBV virions and genetic susceptibility to schizophrenia, with individuals with elevated levels of both type of markers having a greater than 8.5-fold odds of a schizophrenia diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with schizophrenia have increased levels of antibodies to some but not all EBV proteins indicating an aberrant response to EBV infection. This aberrant response may contribute to the immunopathology of schizophrenia and related disorders.","Dickerson, Faith; Jones-Brando, Lorraine; Ford, Glen; Genovese, Giulio; Stallings, Cassie; Origoni, Andrea; O’Dushlaine, Colm; Katsafanas, Emily; Sweeney, Kevin; Khushalani, Sunil; Yolken, Robert",Schizophr Bull,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6737467/,175
4062,Microbiome-Transcriptome Interactions Related to Severity of Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infection,2019-09-25,"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of lower respiratory tract infections and hospital visits during infancy and childhood. Although risk factors for RSV infection have been identified, the role of microbial species in the respiratory tract is only partially known. We aimed to understand the impact of interactions between the nasal microbiome and host transcriptome on the severity and clinical outcomes of RSV infection. We used 16 S rRNA sequencing to characterize the nasal microbiome of infants with RSV infection. We used RNA sequencing to interrogate the transcriptome of CD4(+) T cells obtained from the same set of infants. After dimension reduction through principal component (PC) analysis, we performed an integrative analysis to identify significant co-variation between microbial clade and gene expression PCs. We then employed LIONESS (Linear Interpolation to Obtain Network Estimates for Single Samples) to estimate the clade-gene association patterns for each infant. Our network-based integrative analysis identified several clade-gene associations significantly related to the severity of RSV infection. The microbial taxa with the highest loadings in the implicated clade PCs included Moraxella, Corynebacterium, Streptococcus, Haemophilus influenzae, and Staphylococcus. Interestingly, many of the genes with the highest loadings in the implicated gene PCs are encoded in mitochondrial DNA, while others are involved in the host immune response.

4401,Analysis of the Potential for N(4)-Hydroxycytidine To Inhibit Mitochondrial Replication and Function,2020-01-27,"N(4)-Hydroxycytidine (NHC) is an antiviral ribonucleoside analog that acts as a competitive alternative substrate for virally encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerases. It exhibits measurable levels of cytotoxicity, with 50% cytotoxic concentration values ranging from 7.5 μM in CEM cells and up to >100 μM in other cell lines. The mitochondrial DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (POLRMT) has been shown to incorporate some nucleotide analogs into mitochondrial RNAs, resulting in substantial mitochondrial toxicity. NHC was tested in multiple assays intended to determine its potential to cause mitochondrial toxicity. NHC showed similar cytotoxicity in HepG2 cells incubated in a glucose-free and glucose-containing media, suggesting that NHC does not impair mitochondrial function in this cell line based on the Crabtree effect. We demonstrate that the 5′-triphosphate of NHC can be used by POLRMT for incorporation into nascent RNA chain but does not cause immediate chain termination. In PC-3 cells treated with NHC, the 50% inhibitory concentrations of mitochondrial protein expression inhibition were 2.7-fold lower than those for nuclear-encoded protein expression, but this effect did not result in selective mitochondrial toxicity. A 14-day incubation of HepG2 cells with NHC had no effect on mitochondrial DNA copy number or extracellular lactate levels. In CEM cells treated with NHC at 10 μM, a slight decrease (by ∼20%) in mitochondrial DNA copy number and a corresponding slight increase in extracellular lactate levels were detected, but these effects were not enhanced by an increase in NHC treatment concentration. In summary, the results indicate that mitochondrial impairment by NHC is not the main contributor to the compound’s observed cytotoxicity in these cell lines.","Sticher, Zachary M.; Lu, Gaofei; Mitchell, Deborah G.; Marlow, Joshua; Moellering, Levi; Bluemling, Gregory R.; Guthrie, David B.; Natchus, Michael G.; Painter, George R.; Kolykhalov, Alexander A.",Antimicrob Agents Chemother,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6985706/,175
4429,The expression patterns of immune response genes in the Peripheral Blood Mononuclear cells of pregnant women presenting with subclinical or clinical HEV infection are different and trimester-dependent: A whole transcriptome analysis,2020-02-03,"Hepatitis E is an enteric disease highly prevalent in the developing countries. The basis for high mortality among pregnant hepatitis E patients remains unclear. Importantly, a large proportion of infected pregnant women present with subclinical infection as well. In order to understand the possible mechanisms influencing clinical presentation of hepatitis E in pregnant women, we explored a system biology approach. For this, PBMCs from various categories were subjected to RNAseq analysis. These included non-pregnant (NPR, acute and convalescent phases) and pregnant (PR, 2(nd) and 3(rd) trimesters, acute phase and subclinical HEV infections) patients and corresponding healthy controls. The current study deals with immune response genes. In contrast to exclusive up-regulation of nonspecific, early immune response transcripts in the NPR patients, the PR patients exhibited broader and heightened expression of genes associated with innate as well as adaptive T and B cell responses. The study identified for the first time (1) inverse relationship of immunoglobulin (Ig) genes overexpression and (2) association of differential expression of S100 series genes with disease presentation. The data suggests possible involvement of TLR4 and NOD1 in pregnant patients and alpha defensins in all patient categories suggesting a role in protection. Induction of IFNγ gene was not detected during the acute phase irrespective of pregnancy. Association of response to vitamin D, transcripts related to NK/NKT and regulatory T cells during subclinical infection are noteworthy. The data obtained here could be correlated with several studies reported earlier in hepatitis E patients suggesting utility of PBMCs as an alternate specimen. The extensive, informative data provided here for the first time should form basis for future studies that will help in understanding pathogenesis of fulminant hepatitis E.","Ramdasi, Ashwini Y.; Arankalle, Vidya A.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6996850/,175
4525,Erratum for Euro Surveill. 2020;25(5),2020-02-13,"BACKGROUND: Miller Fisher syndrome is a variant of acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy classically characterized by ataxia, ophthalmoplegia, and areflexia. Miller Fisher syndrome can present with uncommon symptoms such as bulbar, facial, and somatic muscle palsies and micturition disturbance. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe the case of a 76-year-old white man with new-onset ataxia, stridor, areflexia, and upper and lower extremity weakness who required intubation at presentation. An initial work-up including imaging studies and serum tests was inconclusive. Eventually, neurophysiological testing and cerebrospinal fluid analysis suggested a diagnosis of Miller Fisher syndrome. Our patient responded to treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin and supportive therapy. CONCLUSION: The occurrence of acute or subacute descending paralysis with involvement of bulbar muscles and respiratory failure can often divert clinicians to a diagnosis of neuromuscular junction disorders (such as botulism or myasthenia gravis), vascular causes like stroke, or electrolyte and metabolic abnormalities. Early identification of Miller Fisher syndrome with appropriate testing is essential to prompt treatment and prevention of further, potentially fatal, deterioration.","Ramakrishna, Karan N.; Tambe, Vikrant; Kattamanchi, Adithya; Dhamoon, Amit S.",J Med Case Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7029460/,175
4554,Pattern of antibody responses to Plasmodium falciparum antigens in individuals differentially exposed to Anopheles bites,2020-02-21,"Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is a major public health concern in China. The most predominant enteroviruses that cause HFMD have traditionally been attributed to enterovirus A71 (EVA71) and coxsackievirus A16 (CVA16). Since its first large outbreak in 2008, the dominant HFMD pathogens are constantly changing. In 2013 and 2015, CVA6 exceeded both EVA71 and CVA16 to become the leading cause of HFMD in some provinces. However, there still lacks a comprehensive overview on the molecular epidemiology and evolution of HFMD-related enteroviruses at the national level. In this study, we performed systematic epidemiological analyses of HFMD-related enteroviruses using the data of 64 published papers that met the inclusion criteria, and conducted phylogenetic analyses based on 12,080 partial VP1 sequences identified in China before 31st June 2018. We found that EVA71 prevalence has decreased sharply but other enteroviruses have increased rapidly from 2008 to 2016 and that one subtype of each enterovirus is represented during the epidemic. In addition, four genotypes EVA71_C4, CVA16_B1, CVA6_D and CVA10_C are the most predominant enterovirus strains and collectively they cause over 90% of all HFMD cases in China according to the phylogenetic trees using representative partial VP1 sequences. These four major enterovirus genotypes have different geographical distributions, and they may co-circulate with other genotypes and serotypes. These results suggest that more molecular epidemiological studies should be performed on several enteroviruses simultaneously, and such information should have implications for virological surveillance, disease management, vaccine development and policy-making on the prevention and control of HFMD.

4581,Author’s correction for Euro Surveill. 2020;25(4),2020-02-20,"Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) develops due to the narrowing or blockage of arteries supplying blood to the lower limbs. Surgical and endovascular interventions are the main treatments for advanced PAD but alternative and adjunctive medical therapies are needed. Currently the main preclinical experimental model employed in PAD research is based on induction of acute hind limb ischemia (HLI) by a 1-stage procedure. Since there are concerns regarding the ability to translate findings from this animal model to patients, we aimed to develop a novel clinically relevant animal model of PAD. HLI was induced in male Apolipoprotein E (ApoE(−/−)) deficient mice by a 2-stage procedure of initial gradual femoral artery occlusion by ameroid constrictors for 14 days and subsequent excision of the femoral artery. This 2-stage HLI model was compared to the classical 1-stage HLI model and sham controls. Ischemia severity was assessed using Laser Doppler Perfusion Imaging (LDPI). Ambulatory ability was assessed using an open field test, a treadmill test and using established scoring scales. Molecular markers of angiogenesis and shear stress were assessed within gastrocnemius muscle tissue samples using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. HLI was more severe in mice receiving the 2-stage compared to the 1-stage ischemia induction procedure as assessed by LDPI (p = 0.014), and reflected in a higher ischemic score (p = 0.004) and lower average distance travelled on a treadmill test (p = 0.045). Mice undergoing the 2-stage HLI also had lower expression of angiogenesis markers (vascular endothelial growth factor, p = 0.004; vascular endothelial growth factor- receptor 2, p = 0.008) and shear stress response mechano-transducer transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (p = 0.041) within gastrocnemius muscle samples, compared to animals having the 1-stage HLI procedure. Mice subjected to the 2-stage HLI receiving an exercise program showed significantly greater improvement in their ambulatory ability on a treadmill test than a sedentary control group. This study describes a novel model of HLI which leads to more severe and sustained ischemia than the conventionally used model. Exercise therapy, which has established efficacy in PAD patients, was also effective in this new model. This new model maybe useful in the evaluation of potential novel PAD therapies.","Krishna, Smriti M.; Omer, Safraz Mohamed; Li, Jiaze; Morton, Susan K.; Jose, Roby J.; Golledge, Jonathan",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7044206/,175
4609,Microarray analyses reveal strain-specific antibody responses to Plasmodium falciparum apical membrane antigen 1 variants following natural infection and vaccination,2020-03-03,"After the release of bilateral ureteral obstruction (BUO), postobstructive diuresis from an impaired urine concentration mechanism is associated with reduced aquaporin 2 (AQP2) abundance in the inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD). However, the underlying molecular mechanism of this AQP2 reduction is incompletely understood. To elucidate the mechanisms responsible for this phenomenon, we studied molecular changes in IMCDs isolated from rats with 4-h BUO or sham operation at the early onset of AQP2 downregulation using mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis. Two-hundred fifteen proteins had significant changes in abundances, with 65% of them downregulated in the IMCD of 4-h BUO rats compared with sham rats. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that significantly changed proteins were associated with functional Gene Ontology terms, including “cell-cell adhesion,” “cell-cell adherens junction,” “mitochondrial inner membrane,” “endoplasmic reticulum chaperone complex,” and the KEGG pathway of glycolysis/gluconeogenesis. Targeted liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry or immunoblot analysis confirmed the changes in 19 proteins representative of each predominant cluster, including AQP2. Electron microscopy demonstrated disrupted tight junctions, disorganized adherens junctions, swollen mitochondria, enlargement of the endoplasmic reticulum lumen, and numerous autophagosomes/lysosomes in the IMCD of rats with 4-h BUO. AQP2 and seven proteins chosen as representative of the significantly altered clusters had a significant increase in immunofluorescence-based colocalization with autophagosomes/lysosomes. Immunogold electron microscopy confirmed colocalization of AQP2 with the autophagosome marker microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 and the lysosomal marker cathepsin D in IMCD cells of rats with 4-h BUO. We conclude that enhanced autophagic degradation of AQP2 and other critical proteins, as well as endoplasmic reticulum stress in the IMCD, are initiated shortly after BUO.","Somparn, Poorichaya; Boonkrai, Chatikorn; Charngkaew, Komgrid; Chomanee, Nusara; Hodge, Kenneth G.; Fenton, Robert A.; Pisitkun, Trairak; Khositseth, Sookkasem",Am J Physiol Renal Physiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7054639/,175

Western blot analysis failed to detect uncoupling protein in the tumors. The elevated respiratory enzyme activities were paralleled by an increase in the mitochondrial DNA content. Restriction analysis of mitochondrial DNA gave no indication of heteroplasmy or other gross alterations. We conclude that the mitochondrial proliferation in oncocytic tumors is probably not the result of a compensatory mechanism for the deficiency in enzyme complexes of the mitochondrial respiratory chain.","Ebner, Doris; Rodel, Gerhard; Pavenstaedt, Iris; Haferkamp, Otto",Virchows Arch B Cell Pathol Incl Mol Pathol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7087864/,175

These can “emerge” as new diseases by expanding their geographical range or by jumping species (from plants to plants, or from animals to humans). Emerging diseases place an additional burden on developing countries which are often struggling to manage the diseases they already have. New diseases spread through weather, insects or other vectors, or by the movement of people, animals or goods. This study examines the role of cross-border travel in the spread of diseases. A survey of travelers and of residents along the Malawi-Mozambique border found that most cross it frequently and that they rarely travel empty-handed, often taking plants and animals with them. People also cross borders seeking medical attention. Attempting to limit travel would hamper an already struggling economy, where many people make a living by producing, processing or transporting plants and animals for food. Cross border travel per se may pose slight danger for the spread of diseases, if governments can collaborate on sharing information about the status of diseases within their border.","Bentley, Jeffery W.; Robson, Mike; Sibale, Bright B.; Nkhulungo, Edwin; Tembo, Yolice; Munthali, Fransisca",Hum Ecol Interdiscip J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7088438/,175

5478,Combating emerging infectious diseases in India: Orchestrating a symphony,2008-11-01,"Coxsackievirus A16 (CVA16) is one of major pathogens of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) in children. Long non-coding RNAs (IncRNAs) have been implicated in various biological processes, but they have not been associated with CVA16 infection. In this study, we comprehensively characterized the landscape of IncRNAs of normal and CVA16 infected rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cells using RNA-Seq to investigate the functional relevance of IncRNAs. We showed that a total of 760 IncRNAs were upregulated and 1210 IncRNAs were downregulated. Out of these dysregulated IncRNAs, 43.64% were intergenic, 22.31% were sense, 15.89% were intronic, 8.67% were bidirectional, 5.59% were antisense, 3.85% were sRNA host IncRNAs and 0.05% were enhancer. Six dysregulated IncRNAs were validated by quantitative PCR assays and the secondary structures of these IncRNAs were projected. Moreover, we conducted a bioinformatics analysis of an IncRNAs (ENST00000602478) to elucidate the diversity of modification and functions of IncRNAs. In summary, the current study compared the dysregulated IncRNAs profile upon CVA16 challenge and illustrated the intricate relationship between coding and IncRNAs transcripts. These results may not only provide a complete picture of transcription in CVA16 infected cells but also provide novel molecular targets for treatments of HFMD.

5579,Human 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase increases resistance to hyperoxic cytotoxicity in lung epithelial cells and involvement with altered MAPK activity,2005-07-29,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is currently considered an important component of metabolic syndrome (MetS). The spectrum of NAFLD includes conditions that range from simple hepatic steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. NAFLD is correlated with liver-related death and is predicted to be the most frequent indication for liver transplantation by 2030. Insulin resistance is directly correlated to the central mechanisms of hepatic steatosis in NAFLD patients, which is strongly correlated to the imbalance of the renin–angiotensin system, that is involved in lipid and glucose metabolism. Among the emerging treatment approaches for NAFLD is the anti-hypertensive agent telmisartan, which has positive effects on liver, lipid, and glucose metabolism, especially through its action on the renin–angiotensin system, by blocking the ACE/AngII/AT1 axis and increasing ACE2/Ang(1–7)/Mas axis activation. However, treatment with this drug is only recommended for patients with an established indication for anti-hypertensive therapy. Thus, there is an increased need for large randomized controlled trials with the aim of elucidating the effects of telmisartan on liver disease, especially NAFLD. From this perspective, the present review aims to provide a brief examination of the pathogenesis of NAFLD/NASH and the role of telmisartan on preventing liver disorders and thus to improve the discussion on potential therapies.","Borém, Luciana M.

However, the treatment-related death of a patient with ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency following adenovirus administration by hepatic artery has led to serious concerns regarding the safety of intravascular adenovirus. Both replication-incompetent (rAd.p53, e.g., SCH58500) and replication-selective (dl1520, aka Onyx-015; CG7870) oncolytic adenoviruses, by intravascular administration, are in clinical trials. We review Phases I and I/II results from these clinical trials. dl1520 and rAd.p53 were well-tolerated following hepatic artery infusion at doses of up to 2×10(12) and 2.5×10(13) particles, respectively. At a dose of 7.5×10(13) particles, rAd.p53 was associated with dose-limiting cardiac output suppression; dl1520 dose escalation did not proceed higher than 2×10(12). Intravenous (i.v.) infusions of dl1520 and CG7870 have been well tolerated by i.v. infusion at doses of 2×10(13) and 6×10(12), respectively, without identification of a maximally tolerated dose to date. Mild/moderate transaminitis was demonstrated in some patients on both the hepatic arterial and i.v. trials at doses ≥10(12) particles. Interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10 were induced in a dose-dependent manner in most patients, but significant interpatient and intrapatient (on repeat doses) variabilities were demonstrated. Evidence of p53 gene expression (Ad.p53) or viral replication (dl1520) was demonstrated in the majority of patients receiving ≥10(12) particles.

5730,Critics slam treatment for SARS as ineffective and perhaps dangerous,2003,"PURPOSE: This study was designed to identify factors associated with death by 6 months post-intensive care unit (ICU) discharge and to develop a practical mortality risk score for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)-treated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patients. We also assessed long-term survivors’ health-related quality of life (HRQL), respiratory symptoms, and anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) frequencies. METHODS: Data from 140 ECMO-treated ARDS patients admitted to three French ICUs (2008–2012) were analyzed. ICU survivors contacted >6 months post-ICU discharge were assessed for HRQL, psychological and PTSD status. RESULTS: Main ARDS etiologies were bacterial (45 %), influenza A[H(1)N(1)] (26 %) and post-operative (17 %) pneumonias. Six months post-ICU discharge, 84 (60 %) patients were still alive. Based on multivariable logistic regression analysis, the PRESERVE (PRedicting dEath for SEvere ARDS on VV-ECMO) score (0–14 points) was constructed with eight pre-ECMO parameters, i.e. age, body mass index, immunocompromised status, prone positioning, days of mechanical ventilation, sepsis-related organ failure assessment, plateau pressure andpositive end-expiratory pressure. Six-month post-ECMO initiation cumulative probabilities of survival were 97, 79, 54 and 16 % for PRESERVE classes 0–2, 3–4, 5–6 and ≥7 (p < 0.001), respectively. HRQL evaluation in 80 % of the 6-month survivors revealed satisfactory mental health but persistent physical and emotional-related difficulties, with anxiety, depression or PTSD symptoms reported, by 34, 25 or 16 %, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The PRESERVE score might help ICU physicians select appropriate candidates for ECMO among severe ARDS patients. Future studies should also focus on physical and psychosocial rehabilitation that could lead to improved HRQL in this population.

Design: Prospective study. Setting: Pediatric intensive care unit of a university children's hospital. Patients: Twelve acutely ill, intubated infants (mean age 4.5 months, mean weight 4.9 kg) with respiratory failure due to documented RSV bronchiolitis. Interventions: Total respiratory system resistance (Rrs) was measured by single breath occlusion at the baseline and after inhaling NO at 20, 40 and 60 ppm for 1 h, and after inhalation of a standard β (2)-agonist, salbutamol. Arterial blood gas analysis was performed at each study level on 6 of the 12 patients. Results: The baseline mean Rrs (SE) was 0.29 (0.04) cm H(2)O/ml per s. At each dose of NO, the mean Rrs (SE) was 0.28 (0.04) cm H(2)O/ml per s. With salbutamol, the mean Rrs (SE) was 0.21 (0.03) cm H(2)O/ml per s. These values were not significantly different from each other (by ANOVA). Inhaled NO produced a significant decrease in Rrs of greater than 4 times the coefficient of variation of the baseline measurement in 3 of 12 patients. Seven of 12 patients had no significant change while two patients had a significant increase in Rrs. Inhaled salbutamol produced a significant decrease in Rrs in 5 of 11 patients, while 6 showed no change in Rrs. Conclusion: Inhaled NO has no apparent bronchodilator effect in the majority of acutely ill infants with RSV bronchiolitis and does not appear to provide any additional benefit over the use of salbutamol. The clinical benefit of inhaled NO as a bronchodilator is questionable under these conditions.","Patel, N. R.; Hammer, J.; Nichani, S.; Numa, A.; Newth, C. J.

It is recognized by the signs of acute- or subacute-onset cough, hemoptysis, diffuse radiographic pulmonary infiltrates, anemia, and hypoxemic respiratory distress. DAH is characterized by the accumulation of intra-alveolar red blood cells originating most frequently from the alveolar capillaries. It must be distinguished from localized pulmonary hemorrhage, which is most commonly due to chronic bronchitis, bronchiectasis, tumor, or localized infection. Hemoptysis, the major sign of DAH, may develop suddenly or over a period of days to weeks; this sign may also be initially absent, in which case diagnostic suspicion is established after sequential bronchoalveolar lavage reveals worsening red blood cell counts. The causes of DAH can be divided into infectious and noninfectious, the latter of which may affect immunocompetent or immunodeficient patients. Pulmonary infections are rarely reported in association with DAH, but they should be considered in the diagnostic workup because of the obvious therapeutic implications. In immunocompromised patients, the main infectious diseases that cause DAH are cytomegalovirus, adenovirus, invasive aspergillosis, Mycoplasma, Legionella, and Strongyloides. In immunocompetent patients, the infectious diseases that most frequently cause DAH are influenza A (H1N1), dengue, leptospirosis, malaria, and Staphylococcus aureus infection. Based on a search of the PubMed and Scopus databases, we review the infectious diseases that may cause DAH in immunocompetent patients.","von Ranke, Felipe Mussi; Zanetti, Gláucia; Hochhegger, Bruno; Marchiori, Edson",Lung,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102311/,175

Nevertheless, the RNA can also form secondary structures by intramolecular base-pairing. RESULTS: We show that the nucleotide distribution within codons is biased in all taxa of life on a global scale. Thereby, RNA secondary structures that require base-pairing between the position 1 of a codon with the position 1 of an opposing codon (here named RNA secondary structure class c(1)) are under-represented. We conclude that this bias may result from the co-evolution of codon sequence and mRNA secondary structure, suggesting that RNA secondary structures are generally important in protein-coding regions of mRNAs.

Weconstructed a database of viruses of domestic artiodactyls and examined the correlation between traits linked in the literature to cross-species transmission and the ability of viruses to infect humans. Among these traits-genomic material, genome segmentation, and replication without nuclear entry-the last is the strongest predictor of cross-species transmission. This finding highlights nuclear entry as a barrier to transmission and suggests that the ability to complete replication in the cytoplasm may prove to be a useful indicator of the threat of cross-species transmission.","Pulliam, Juliet R.

7683,Infection non bactérienne,2014-12-17,"Pneumonia may be complicated by necrosis and destruction of lung tissue due to factors related to both pathogen and host as well as to their interactions. Lung necrosis may lead to two main entities sharing common features, but also several clinical and pathological differences: lung abscesses and necrotizing pneumonia. Necrotizing pneumonia is characterized by diffuse, possibly bilateral, lung parenchyma inflammation with multiple cavitations and necrosis. Necrotizing pneumonia is usually associated with severe sepsis and acute respiratory failure. Adequate antibiotics, mechanical ventilation, pleural drainage, and prolonged supportive care are mandatory. Adult patients with necrotizing pneumonia may require surgery. In our practice, indications for surgery are: (1) uncontrolled sepsis in spite of medical therapy and chest drainage; (2) major air leaks responsible for ventilation difficulties with serious hypoxemia/hypercapnia; and (3) hemodynamic disturbances by compression of vena cava and/or right heart cavities by tumor-like forms. Surgical treatment should be adapted to each case. Despite serious morbidity, massive parenchyma damage and prolonged hospitalization, long-term outcome following necrotizing pneumonia seems good when multidisciplinary care management is used in these patients with unusual but severe respiratory infectious disease.","Rabbat, A.; Alifano, M.",Reanimation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7117818/,175

Compared with the specific lysis of xenogeneic K562-, U937- and Vero-target cells, NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity (NK-CMC) against PM/86 melanoma tumor cells was significantly lower in a 16 h chromium release assay. The target cell susceptibility to pheriperal blood NK-CMC of both adult Troll® miniature swine and German Landrace sows was very similar. Cold target inhibition assays revealed the allogeneic PM/86 melanoma cells to be the most powerful inhibitors of NK-CMC. Nylon wool non-adherent lymphocytes produced interferon (IFN)-alpha in different quantities upon contact with NK susceptible target cells. The NK effector cells could lytic activity against all susceptible targets by a moderate dose of natural human inteleukin-2 (nhuIL-2). The role of NK-CMC in melanoma tumor rejection and/or prevention of metastases is yet unknown in swine although porcine melanoma serves as a good model for the disease in man.","Büttner, Mathias; Wanke, Rüdiger; Obermann, Bernd",Vet Immunol Immunopathol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7119508/,175
7773,Endogenous gamma interferon produced in central nervous system by systemic infection infection with Theiler's virus in mice,2002-12-10,"Field studies have suggested that ‘stressors’, such as transportation and mixing, might interfere with the immune competence of pigs. Therefore, an experimental model was established to study the influence of elevated concentrations of circulating cortisol on the immune capacity in swine. Three experimental groups, with six pigs in each, were immunized twice, 4 weeks apart, with Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae antigen. Endogenous production of cortisol was induced by intramuscular injection of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) twice daily. One group received ACTH during the week before and after the second immunization, one group during the week after the second immunization only, while one group served as untreated controls. The treatment with ACTH induced high, but physiological, concentrations of cortisol in plasma. Simultaneously, the number of lymphocytes per milliliter blood decreased while the neutrophil number increased. The elevated concentrations of cortisol also coincided with reduced proliferation and interleukin-2 production by blood lymphocytes stimulated with the mitogens concanavalin A and phytohemagglutinin in vitro, while the responses to pokeweed mitogen were less affected. The suppression of mitogen responses was more pronounced in cultures of whole blood than in cultures of purified peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Antibody production, induced by M. hyopneumoniae in cultures of purified PBMC was also inhibited by ACTH treatment. Both the rate of increase and the magnitude of the antibody production induced by the primary immunization were reduced. In contrast, no effects of ACTH treatment were recorded for the response to the second immunization or on the serum levels of antibodies to M. hyopneumoniae. The ability of blood leukocytes to produce interferon-α (IFN-α) at exposure in vitro to fixed pseudorabies virus adsorbed to porcine kidney cells increased in all animals shortly after the second immunization with M. hyopneumoniae. The influence of cortisol on the IFN-α-producing capacity was dependent on whether the test was carried out in whole blood cultures or in cultures with purified PBMC. This finding further emphasizes that the relevance of in vitro assays for measuring in vivo phenomena must be carefully scrutinized.","Wallgren, Per; Wilén, Inga-Lill; Fossum, Caroline",Vet Immunol Immunopathol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7119580/,175

10257,Viruses and autoimmunity: an affair but not a marriage contract,2002-03-12,"Woody plant encroachment into grasslands is a global concern. Efforts to restore grasslands often assume that removal of woody plants benefits biodiversity but assumptions are rarely tested. In the Chihuahuan Desert of the Southwestern United States, we tested whether abundances of grassland specialist bird species would be greater in plant communities resulting from treatment with herbicides to remove encroaching shrubs compared with untreated shrub‐dominated areas that represented pre‐treatment conditions. In 2010, we surveyed breeding birds and vegetation at 16 treated–untreated pairs. In 2011, we expanded the survey effort to 21 treated–untreated pairs, seven unpaired treatment areas, and five reference grassland areas. Vegetation in treatment areas had higher perennial grass foliar and basal cover and lower shrub foliar cover compared with untreated areas. Several regionally declining grassland specialists exhibited higher occurrence and relative abundance in treated areas. A shrubland specialist, however, was associated with untreated areas and may be negatively impacted by shrub removal. Bird community composition differed between treated and untreated areas in both years. Our results indicate that shrub removal can have positive effects on grassland specialist bird species, but that a mosaic of treated and untreated areas might be most beneficial for regional biodiversity.","Coffman, John M.; Bestelmeyer, Brandon T.; Kelly, Jeffrey F.; Wright, Timothy F.; Schooley, Robert L.",Restor Ecol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7169160/,175

RECENT FINDINGS: Postoperative respiratory impairment may be due to various causes, such as age, surgery type, comorbidity, smoking, preoperative anemia, and general anesthesia. However, increasing evidence suggests that residual neuromuscular block is an important risk factor for postoperative pulmonary complications and may affect the outcome. Conflicting data from some recent reports show that the use of quantitative neuromuscular monitoring alone does not preclude residual neuromuscular block and that improvements in the interpretation of neuromuscular monitoring may be required. Pulmonary complications seem to be reduced for train-of-four ratios > 0.95 before tracheal extubation compared with > 0.9. SUMMARY: This review stresses the need for appropriate management of neuromuscular block in the prevention of postoperative pulmonary complications but acknowledges that the causes are multifactorial.","Cammu, Guy",Curr Anesthesiol Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7222856/,175

Several studies have shown that fusion (Fu) and bc loop of DENV envelope domain II are highly conserved and consist some of the most dominant antigenic epitopes. Therefore, in this study, Fu and bc loops were joined together to develop a short recombinant protein as an alternative of whole DENV envelope protein, and its immunogenic potential as fusion peptide was estimated. For de novo designing of the antigen, Fu and bc peptides were linked with an optimised linker so that the three dimensional conformation was maintained as it is in DENV envelope protein. The redesigned Fubc protein was expressed in E. coli and purified. Subsequently, structural integrity of the purified protein was verified by CD spectroscopy. To characterise immune responses against recombinant Fubc protein, BALB/c mice were subcutaneously injected with emulsified antigen preparation. It was observed by ELISA that Fubc fusion protein elicited higher serum IgG antibody response either in the presence or in absence of Freund’s adjuvant in comparison to the immune response of Fu and bc peptides separately. Furthermore, the binding of Fubc protein with mice antisera was validated by SPR analysis. These results suggest that Fu and bc epitope-based recombinant fusion protein could be a potential candidate towards the development of the effective subunit vaccine against DENV.

There are few studies addressing what factors might predict poor outcomes in this patient population. The purpose of the current study was to investigate characteristics and outcomes of patients hospitalized with HRF. METHODS: A study of patients ≥ 18 years admitted with HRF in a 1-year period. Patients with limited life expectancy related to other conditions, and those with a non-respiratory cause of HRF, were excluded. RESULTS: 202 subjects met eligibility criteria: 24% had a diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea, 6% obesity hypoventilation, 46% chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and 10% asthma. Fifteen (7%) died during the index admission. Forty-one patients (23%) were readmitted within 30 days: peripheral vascular disease [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 4.78, CI 1.45–15.74] and tachycardia (aOR 2.97, CI 1.22–7.26) were associated with an increased risk of readmission.

In contemporary neuroscience, the predictive-processing framework has been proposed as a general working principle of the human brain, the optimization of predictions about the consequences of one’s own actions, and sensory inputs from the environment. However, the predictive-processing framework has rarely been applied to infancy research. We argue that a predictive-processing framework may provide a unifying perspective on several phenomena of infant development and learning that may seem unrelated at first sight. These phenomena include statistical learning principles, infants’ motor and proprioceptive learning, and infants’ basic understanding of their physical and social environment. We discuss how a predictive-processing perspective can advance the understanding of infants’ early learning processes in theory, research, and application.","Köster, Moritz; Kayhan, Ezgi; Langeloh, Miriam; Hoehl, Stefanie",Perspect Psychol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7243078/,175

We propose a role for Piezo1 channels, which are mechanically-activated non-selective cation channels. In cultured microvascular endothelial cells, Piezo1 channel activation by either shear stress or a chemical agonist Yoda1 activated a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein 10 (ADAM10), a Ca(2+)-regulated transmembrane sheddase that mediates S2 Notch1 cleavage. Consistent with this observation, we found Piezo1-dependent increase in the abundance of Notch1 intracellular domain (NICD) that depended on ADAM10 and the downstream S3 cleavage enzyme, γ-secretase. Conditional endothelial-specific disruption of Piezo1 in adult mice suppressed the expression of multiple Notch1 target genes in hepatic vasculature, suggesting constitutive functional importance in vivo. The data suggest that Piezo1 is a mechanism conferring force sensitivity on ADAM10 and Notch1 with downstream consequences for sustained activation of Notch1 target genes and potentially other processes.","Caolo, Vincenza; Debant, Marjolaine; Endesh, Naima; Futers, T Simon; Lichtenstein, Laeticia; Bartoli, Fiona; Parsonage, Gregory; Jones, Elizabeth AV; Beech, David J",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7295575/,175

METHODS: One hundred and eighty dog cases referred to a veterinary behaviourist in São Paulo (Brazil) during the period of 2008–2014 are described. RESULTS: Aggression against people was the most common behavioural complaint (22.2 per cent of the cases), followed by apparent fears and phobias (13.3 per cent). Forms of aggression against other dogs (12.2 per cent) and repetitive behaviours (11.1 per cent) were third and fourth most frequent, respectively. Female and male patients were equally reported (47.6 and 52.4 per cent, respectively). These results differ slightly from the findings of other international studies, in which aggression was the main behavioural complaint with fears and phobias less common.

Here we systematically examined the state and accessibility of chromatin in the developing mouse fetus. In total we performed 1,128 chromatin immunoprecipitation with sequencing (ChIP–seq) assays for histone modifications and 132 assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC–seq) assays for chromatin accessibility across 72 distinct tissue-stages. We used integrative analysis to develop a unified set of chromatin state annotations, infer the identities of dynamic enhancers and key transcriptional regulators, and characterize the relationship between chromatin state and accessibility during developmental gene regulation. We also leveraged these data to link enhancers to putative target genes and demonstrate tissue-specific enrichments of sequence variants associated with disease in humans. The mouse ENCODE data sets provide a compendium of resources for biomedical researchers and achieve, to our knowledge, the most comprehensive view of chromatin dynamics during mammalian fetal development to date.","Gorkin, David U.; Barozzi, Iros; Zhao, Yuan; Zhang, Yanxiao; Huang, Hui; Lee, Ah Young; Li, Bin; Chiou, Joshua; Wildberg, Andre; Ding, Bo; Zhang, Bo; Wang, Mengchi; Strattan, J.

However, the mechanisms underlying its low nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity remain unclear. In the present study we compared the antibacterial and toxicity profiles of etimicin, gentamicin (GM, a second-generation AG), and amikacin (AMK, a third-generation AG), and investigated their pharmacokinetic properties in the toxicity target organs (kidney and inner ear) and subcellular compartments. We first demonstrated that ETM exhibited superior antibacterial activities against clinical isolates to GM and AMK, and it exerted minimal nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity in rats following multi-dose administration. Then, we conducted pharmacokinetic studies in rats, showed that the three AGs accumulated in the kidney and inner ear with ETM being distributed to a lesser degree in the two toxicity target organs as compared with GM and AMK high-dose groups. Furthermore, we conducted in vitro experiments in NRK-52E rat renal tubular epithelial cells and HEI-OC1 cochlear hair cells, and revealed that all the three AGs were distributed predominantly in the mitochondria with ETM showing minimal accumulation; they not only directly inhibited the activity of mitochondrial complexes IV and V but also inhibited mitochondrial function and its related PGC-1α-NRF1-TFAM pathway; ETM caused minimal damage to the mitochondrial complex and mitochondrial biogenesis. Our results demonstrate that the minimal otonephrotoxicity of ETM results from its lesser accumulation in mitochondria of target cells and subsequently lesser inhibition of mitochondrial function. These results provide a new strategy for discovering novel AGs with high efficacy and low toxicity.","Yao, Lan; Zhang, Jing-wei; Chen, Bin; Cai, Ming-min; Feng, Dong; Wang, Qi-zhi; Wang, Xin-yu; Sun, Jian-guo; Zheng, Yi-wen; Wang, Guang-ji; Zhou, Fang",Acta Pharmacol Sin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7468263/,175

Both proteins contain a bromodomain (BrD) adjacent to the histone acetyl transferase (HAT) catalytic domain, which serves as a promising drug target for cancers and immune system disorders. Several potent and selective small-molecule inhibitors targeting CBP BrD have been reported, but thus far small-molecule inhibitors targeting BrD outside of the BrD and extraterminal domain (BET) family are especially lacking. Here, we established and optimized a TR-FRET-based high-throughput screening platform for the CBP BrD and acetylated H4 peptide. Through an HTS assay against an in-house chemical library containing 20 000 compounds, compound DC_CP20 was discovered as a novel CBP BrD inhibitor with an IC(50) value of 744.3 nM. This compound bound to CBP BrD with a K(D) value of 4.01 μM in the surface plasmon resonance assay. Molecular modeling revealed that DC_CP20 occupied the Kac-binding region firmly through hydrogen bonding with the conserved residue N1168. At the celluslar level, DC_CP20 dose-dependently inhibited the proliferation of human leukemia MV4-11 cells with an IC(50) value of 19.2 μM and markedly downregulated the expression of the c-Myc in the cells. Taken together, the discovery of CBP BrD inhibitor DC_CP20 provides a novel chemical scaffold for further medicinal chemistry optimization and a potential chemical probe for CBP-related biological function research. In addition, this inhibitor may serve as a promising therapeutic strategy for MLL leukemia by targeting CBP BrD protein.","Zhang, Feng-cai; Sun, Zhong-ya; Liao, Li-ping; Zuo, Yu; Zhang, Dan; Wang, Jun; Chen, Yan-tao; Xiao, Sen-hao; Jiang, Hao; Lu, Tian; Xu, Pan; Yue, Li-yan; Du, Dao-hai; Zhang, Hao; Liu, Chuan-peng; Luo, Cheng",Acta Pharmacol Sin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7468272/,175
12778,Inactivation of TSC1 promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition of renal tubular epithelial cells in mouse diabetic nephropathy,2019-06-24,"T cell metabolic activation plays a crucial role in inflammation of atherosclerosis. Shikonin (SKN), a natural naphthoquinone with anti-inflammatory activity, has shown to exert cardioprotective effects, but the effect of SKN on atherosclerosis is unclear. In addition, SKN was found to inhibit glycolysis via targeting pyruvate kinase muscle isozyme 2 (PKM2). In the present study, we investigated the effects of SKN on hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy)-accelerated atherosclerosis and T cell inflammatory activation in ApoE(−/−) mice and the metabolic mechanisms in this process. Drinking water supplemented with Hcy (1.8 g/L) was administered to ApoE(−/−) mice for 2 weeks and the mice were injected with SKN (1.2 mg/kg, i.p.) or vehicle every 3 days. We showed that SKN treatment markedly attenuated HHcy-accelerated atherosclerosis in ApoE(−/−) mice and significantly decreased inflammatory activated CD4(+) T cells and proinflammatory macrophages in plaques. In splenic CD4(+) T cells isolated from HHcy-ApoE(−/−) mice, SKN treatment significantly inhibited HHcy-stimulated PKM2 activity, interferon-γ secretion and the capacity of these T cells to promote macrophage proinflammatory polarization. SKN treatment significantly inhibited HHcy-stimulated CD4(+) T cell glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation. Metabolic profiling analysis of CD4(+) T cells revealed that Hcy administration significantly increased various glucose metabolites as well as lipids and acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1, which were reversed by SKN treatment. In conclusion, our results suggest that SKN is effective to ameliorate atherosclerosis in HHcy-ApoE(−/−) mice and this is at least partly associated with the inhibition of SKN on CD4(+) T cell inflammatory activation via PKM2-dependent metabolic suppression.","Lü, Si-lin; Dang, Guo-hui; Deng, Jia-cheng; Liu, Hui-ying; Liu, Bo; Yang, Juan; Ma, Xiao-long; Miao, Yu-tong; Jiang, Chang-tao; Xu, Qing-bo; Wang, Xian; Feng, Juan",Acta Pharmacol Sin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7468273/,175
12782,Shikonin attenuates hyperhomocysteinemia-induced CD4(+) T cell inflammatory activation and atherosclerosis in ApoE(−/−) mice by metabolic suppression,2019-10-13,"Increasing studies show that inflammatory processes may be involved in depressive disorders. Nuclear factor erythroid-2 related factor 2 (Nrf2) modulates tissue microglial M1 phenotypic changes to the M2 phenotype, which is implicated in protection against inflammatory diseases. We have reported that the adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs) display anti-inflammatory activity. In this study we explored whether the mechanism of anti-inflammatory activity of ADSCs was related to Nrf2. ADSCs were isolated from mouse fat pads and intravenously administered to chronic mild stress (CMS)-exposed C57BL/6 mice at the dose of 1 × 10(6) once a week for 3 weeks. We showed that ADSC administration significantly remedied CMS-induced depressive-like behaviors in sucrose preference test, tail suspension test, and forced swim test accompanied by suppressing microglial activation and the expression of inflammatory factors including MCP-1, TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6. Furthermore, ADSC administration promoted both the expression of BDNF and TrkB, and promoted Nrf2/HO-1 signaling but suppressed TLR4/NF-κB signaling in brain tissue. In order to elucidate the role of Nrf2/HO-1 signaling in ADSC-caused neuroprotection, Nrf2-modified ADSCs were cocultured with BV2 microglial cells, then exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Downregulation of Nrf2 in ADSCs decreased the protective effects of ADSCs against LPS-induced microglial activation and M1 polarization. Nrf2 overexpression in ADSCs markedly suppressed LPS-induced TLR4 and NF-κB expression in microglial cells. These results suggest a possible antidepressive mechanism correlated with microglial polarization for anti-inflammatory agents, which may provide a new microglia-targeted strategy for depression therapy.","Huang, Xiao; Fei, Guo-qiang; Liu, Wen-juan; Ding, Jing; Wang, Yuan; Wang, Hao; Ji, Jian-lin; Wang, Xin",Acta Pharmacol Sin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7468309/,175
12784,AZD9291 inactivates the PRC2 complex to mediate tumor growth inhibition,2019-06-06,"Thromboembolic disease is a common cardio-cerebral vascular disease that threatens human life and health. Thrombin not only affects the exogenous coagulation pathway, but also the endogenous pathway. Thus, it becomes one of the most important targets of anticoagulant drugs. RGD-hirudin is an anticoagulant drug targeting thrombin, but it can only be administered intravenously. We designed a low molecular weight peptide based on RGD-hirudin that could prevent blood clots. We first used NMR to identify the key amino acid residues of RGD-hirudin that interacted with thrombin. Then, we designed a novel direct thrombin inhibitor peptide (DTIP) based on the structure and function of RGD-hirudin using homology modeling. Molecular docking showed that the targeting and binding of DTIP with thrombin were similar to those of RGD-hirudin, suggesting DTIP interacted directly with thrombin. The active amino acids of DTIP were identified by alanine scanning, and mutants were successfully constructed. In blood clotting time tests in vitro, we found that aPTT, PT, and TT in the rat plasma added with DTIP were greatly prolonged than in that added with the mutants. Subcutaneous injection of DTIP in rats also could significantly prolong the clotting time. Thrombelastography analysis revealed that DTIP significantly delayed blood coagulation. Bio-layer interferometry study showed that there were no significant differences between DTIP and the mutants in thrombin affinity constants, suggesting that it might bind to other sites of thrombin rather than to its active center. Our results demonstrate that DTIP with low molecular weight can prevent thrombosis via subcutaneous injection.","Li, Ya-ran; Huang, Yi-nong; Zhao, Bing; Wu, Meng-fang; Li, Tian-yu; Zhang, Yan-ling; Chen, Di; Yu, Min; Mo, Wei",Acta Pharmacol Sin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7468311/,175

Here, we evaluated the BTK inhibitory activity of a series of pyrimido[4,5-d][1,3]oxazin-2-one derivatives. Combining this evaluation with structure-activity relationship (SAR) analysis, we found that compound 2 exhibited potent BTK kinase inhibitory activity, with an IC(50) of 7 nM. This derivative markedly inhibited BTK activation in TMD8 B cell lymphoma cells and thus inhibited the in vitro growth of the cells. Further studies revealed that compound 2 dose dependently arrested TMD8 cells at G(1) phase, accompanied by decreased levels of Rb, phosphorylated Rb, and cyclin D1. Moreover, following treatment with compound 2, TMD8 cells underwent apoptosis associated with PARP and caspase 3 cleavage. Interestingly, the results of the kinase activity assay on a small panel of 35 kinases showed that the kinase selectivity of compound 2 was superior to that of the first-generation inhibitor ibrutinib, suggesting that compound 2 could be a second-generation inhibitor of BTK. In conclusion, we identified a potent and highly selective BTK inhibitor worthy of further development.","Lai, Meng-zhen; Song, Pei-ran; Dou, Dou; Diao, Yan-yan; Tong, Lin-jiang; Zhang, Tao; Xie, Hua; Li, Hong-lin; Ding, Jian",Acta Pharmacol Sin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7468319/,175

In this study, we investigated whether olanzapine protected against rotenone-induced neurotoxicity in PC12 cells. We showed that treatment with olanzapine increased the phosphorylation of AMPK in both dose- and time-dependent manners in PC12 cells. In addition, olanzapine activated autophagy and increased autophagic vacuoles. Furthermore, olanzapine pretreatment could protect PC12 cells from rotenone-induced apoptosis. Besides, olanzapine pretreatment could suppress the rotenone-induced depolarization of mitochondrial potential and thus protect the cells. Moreover, pretreatment with specific AMPK inhibitor compound C or with autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine impaired the protective effect of olanzapine on rotenone-treated PC12 cells. In summary, our results show for the first time that olanzapine ameliorates rotenone-induced injury by activating autophagy through AMPK pathway.","Xiong, Ya-jie; Song, Yun-zhen; Zhu, Ying; Zuo, Wen-qing; Zhao, Yi-fan; Shen, Xiao; Wang, Wen-juan; Liu, Ya-li; Wu, Jun-chao; Liang, Zhong-qin",Acta Pharmacol Sin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7468335/,175

In the current study, we investigated the effect of xanthatin on the growth of glioma cells in vitro and in vivo, and elucidated the underlying mechanisms. In both rat glioma C6 and human glioma U251 cell lines, xanthatin (1–15 μM) dose-dependently inhibited cell viability without apparent effect on the cell cycle. Furthermore, xanthatin treatment dose-dependently induced glioma cell apoptosis. In nude mice bearing C6 glioma tumor xenografts, administration of xanthatin (10, 20, 40 mg·kg(−1)·d(−1), ip, for 2 weeks) dose-dependently inhibited the tumor growth, but did not affect the body weight. More importantly, xanthatin treatment markedly increased the expression levels of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-related markers in both the glioma cell lines as well as in C6 xenografts, including glucose-regulated protein 78, C/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP), activating factor 4, activating transcription factor 6, spliced X-box binding protein-1, phosphorylated protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase, and phosphorylated eukaryotic initiation factor 2a. Pretreatment of C6 glioma cells with the ER stress inhibitor 4-phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA, 7 mM) or knockdown of CHOP using small interfering RNA significantly attenuated xanthatin-induced cell apoptosis and increase of proapoptotic caspase-3. These results demonstrate that xanthatin induces glioma cell apoptosis and inhibits tumor growth via activating the ER stress-related unfolded protein response pathway involving CHOP induction. Xanthatin may serve as a promising agent in the treatment of human glioma.","Ma, Yu-yang; Di, Ze-min; Cao, Qing; Xu, Wen-shuang; Bi, Si-xing; Yu, Ji-shuang; Shen, Yu-jun; Yu, Yong-qiang; Shen, Yu-xian; Feng, Li-jie",Acta Pharmacol Sin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7468336/,175

While the biobanking community is in general committed to such principles, little is known about precisely which governance strategies biobanks adopt to meet those objectives. We conducted an exploratory analysis of governance mechanisms adopted by research biobanks, including genetic biobanks, located in Europe and Canada. We reviewed information available on the websites of 69 biobanks, and directly contacted them for additional information. Our study identified six types of commonly adopted governance strategies: communication, compliance, expert advice, external review, internal procedures, and partnerships. Each strategy is implemented through different mechanisms including, independent ethics assessment, informed consent processes, quality management, data access control, legal compliance, standard operating procedures and external certification. Such mechanisms rely on a wide range of bodies, committees and actors from both within and outside the biobanks themselves. We found that most biobanks aim to be transparent about their governance mechanisms, but could do more to provide more complete and detailed information about them. In particular, the retrievable information, while showing efforts to ensure biobanks operate in a legitimate way, does not specify in sufficient detail how governance mechanisms support accountability, nor how they ensure oversight of research operations. This state of affairs can potentially undermine biobanks’ trustworthiness to stakeholders and the public in a long-term perspective. Given the ever-increasing reliance of biomedical research on large biological repositories and their associated databases, we recommend that biobanks increase their efforts to future-proof their governance.","Gille, Felix; Vayena, Effy; Blasimme, Alessandro",Eur J Hum Genet,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7468350/,175

12814,FSHR ablation induces depression-like behaviors,2020-03-18,"In chronic infectious diseases caused by gram-negative bacteria, such as osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, and periodontitis, osteoclastic activity is enhanced with elevated inflammation, which disturbs the bone homeostasis and results in osteolysis. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), as a bacteria product, plays an important role in this process. Recent evidence shows that an antimalarial drug artesunate attenuates LPS-induced osteolysis independent of RANKL. In this study we evaluated the effects of artesunate on LPS-induced osteoclastogenesis in vitro and femur osteolysis in vivo, and explored the mechanisms underlying the effects of artesunate on LPS-induced osteoclast differentiation independent of RANKL. In preosteoclastic RAW264.7 cells, we found that artesunate (1.56−12.5 μM) dose dependently inhibited LPS-induced osteoclast formation accompanied by suppressing LPS-stimulated osteoclast-related gene expression (Fra-2, TRAP, Cathepsin K, β3-integrin, DC-STAMP, and Atp6v0d2). We showed that artesunate (3.125−12.5 µM) inhibited LPS-stimulated nuclear factor of activated T cells c1 (NFATc1) but not NF-κB transcriptional activity; artesunate (6.25, 12.5 μM) significantly inhibited LPS-stimulated NFATc1 protein expression. Furthermore, artesunate treatment markedly suppressed LPS-induced Ca(2+) influx, and decreased the expression of PP2B-Aα (calcineurin) and pPLCγ1 in the cells. In addition, artesunate treatment significantly decreased the expression of upstream signals TLR4 and TRAF6 during LPS-induced osteoclastogenesis. Administration of artesunate (10 mg/kg, ip) for 8 days effectively inhibited serum TNF-α levels and ameliorated LPS (5 mg/kg, ip)-induced inflammatory bone loss in vivo. Taken together, artesunate attenuates LPS-induced inflammatory osteoclastogenesis by inhibiting the expression of TLR4/TRAF6 and the downstream PLCγ1-Ca(2+)-NFATc1 signaling pathway. Artesunate is a valuable choice to treat bone loss induced by gram-negative bacteria infection or inflammation in RANKL-independent pathway.","Zeng, Xiang-zhou; Zhang, Yue-yang; Yang, Qin; Wang, Song; Zou, Bin-hua; Tan, Yan-hui; Zou, Min; Liu, Shu-wen; Li, Xiao-juan",Acta Pharmacol Sin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7468527/,175

This study aimed to confirm the cardioprotective effects of SAAS in rats with myocardial infarction and to investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms based on proteome and transcriptome profiling of myocardial tissue. The results showed that SAAS effectively protected against myocardial injury and improved cardiac function. The differentially expressed proteins and genes included important structural molecules, receptors, transcription factors, and cofactors. Functional enrichment analysis indicated that SAAS participated in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton, phagosome, focal adhesion, tight junction, apoptosis, MAPK signaling, and Wnt signaling pathways, which are closely related to cardiovascular diseases. SAAS may exert its cardioprotective effect by targeting multiple pathways at both the proteome and transcriptome levels.

However, the antitumor efficacy of existing small-molecule IDO1 inhibitors is still unsatisfactory, and the underlying mechanism remains largely undefined. To identify novel IDO1 inhibitors, an in-house natural product library of 2000 natural products was screened for inhibitory activity against recombinant human IDO1. High-throughput fluorescence-based screening identified 79 compounds with inhibitory activity > 30% at 20 μM. Nine natural products were further confirmed to inhibit IDO1 activity by > 30% using Ehrlich’s reagent reaction. Compounds 2, 7, and 8 were demonstrated to inhibit IDO1 activity in a cellular context. Compounds 2 and 7 were more potent against IDO1 than TDO2 in the enzymatic assay. The kinetic studies showed that compound 2 exhibited noncompetitive inhibition, whereas compounds 7 and 8 were graphically well matched with uncompetitive inhibition. Compounds 7 and 8 were found to bind to the ferric-IDO1 enzyme. Docking stimulations showed that the naphthalene ring of compound 8 formed “T-shaped” π–π interactions with Phe-163 and that the 6-methyl-naphthalene group formed additional hydrophobic interactions with IDO1.

Therefore, the development of effective antifibrotic drugs is urgently required. IMB-S7 is novel biphenyl compound derived from bifendate (biphenyldicarboxylate) that is used for the treatment of chronic hepatitis in China. In the current study we investigated the potential of IMB-S7 as an antihepatic fibrosis agent. In bile duct ligation (BDL) rat model, oral administration of IMB-S7 (400 mg· kg(−1)· d(−1), for 14 days) significantly ameliorated BDL-induced liver necrosis, bile duct proliferation, and collagen accumulation. We then showed that IMB-S7 treatment markedly suppressed the TGF-β/Smad pathway in human hepatic stellate cell line LX2 and mouse primary HSCs, as well as in liver samples of BDL rats, thus inhibiting the transcription of most fibrogenesis-associated genes, including TGF-β1, COL1A1, and ACTA2. Furthermore, IMB-S7 treatment significantly suppressed the expression of integrin αv at the mRNA and protein levels in TGF-β-treated LX2 cells and liver samples of BDL rats. Using integrin αv overexpression and silencing, we demonstrated that integrin αv activity correlated positively with the activation of TGF-β/Smad pathway. Based on dual luciferase assay and DNA affinity precipitation assay, we revealed that IMB-S7 inactivated integrin αv through competitively inhibiting the binding of Sp1, a transcription factor, to the integrin αv (ITGAV) promoter (−173/−163 bp). These results suggest that IMB-S7 inhibits HSCs activation and liver fibrosis through Sp1-integrin αv signaling, and IMB-S7 may be a promising candidate to combat hepatic fibrosis in the future.","Zhang, Na; Zhao, Shuang-shuang; Zhang, Yi-xuan; Wang, Yu-cheng; Shao, Rong-guang; Wang, Ju-xian; He, Hong-wei",Acta Pharmacol Sin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7470799/,175

We demonstrated that this method can be applied to associate herbs with their putative targets. In the case study of three well-known herbs, Radix Glycyrrhizae, Flos Lonicerae, and Rhizoma Coptidis, approximately 70% of the predicted targets were supported by scientific literature. By linking 406 targets to 2439 annotated diseases, we further analyzed the pharmacological functions of 197 herbs. Finally, we proposed a strategy of target-oriented herbal formula design and illustrated the target profiles for four common chronic diseases, namely, Alzheimer’s disease, depressive disorder, hypertensive disease, and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.

In this study we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying downregulation of TMEM16A CaCC activity during hypertension. In cultured basilar artery smooth muscle cells (BASMCs) isolated from 2k2c renohypertesive rats, treatment with angiotensin II (0.125−1 μM) dose-dependently increased endophilin A2 levels and decreased TMEM16A expression. Similar phenomenon was observed in basilar artery isolated from 2k2c rats. We then used whole-cell recording to examine whether endophilin A2 could regulate TMEM16A CaCC activity in BASMCs and found that knockdown of endophilin A2 significantly enhanced CaCC activity, whereas overexpression of endophilin A2 produced the opposite effect. Overexpression of endophilin A2 did not affect the TMEM16A mRNA level, but markedly decreased TMEM16A protein level in BASMCs by inducing ubiquitination and autophagy of TMEM16A. Ubiquitin-binding receptor p62 (SQSTM1) could bind to ubiquitinated TMEM16A and resulted in a process of TMEM16A proteolysis in autophagosome/lysosome.

Our previous works show that bile duct ligation (BDL) impairs expression and function of brain BCRP in rats. Since zidovudine (AZT) is BCRP substrate, we investigated whether impaired expression and function of BCRP increased brain distribution and toxicity of AZT in BDL-D7 rats. After administration of AZT (10 mg/kg, i.v.), BDL markedly increased brain AZT concentrations, compared with sham-operated (SO) rats. The ratio of AZT brain-to-plasma area under concentration curve (AUC) in BDL rats was increased to 1.6-folds of SO rats. After treatment with AZT (100 mg/kg every day, i.v.) for 7 days, BDL significantly impaired cognitive functions compared with SO rats, evidenced by the significantly decreased percentage of alternation in Y-maze test and prolonged escaped latency in two-way passive avoidance trial. Furthermore, AZT treatment caused significant decrease in copies of mitochondrial DNA and mitochondrial membrane potential in hippocampus of BDL rats. Moreover, AZT treatment caused a significant decrease of cortex microtubule-associated protein 2 and hippocampus synaptophysin levels in BDL rats. AZT-induced CNS adverse alterations in BDL rats were not observed in SO rats treated with AZT. In conclusion, BDL decreases the function and expression of brain BCRP in rats, leading to increased brain distribution of AZT, which in turn enhances AZT CNS toxicity, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction, neuronal damage, and ultimately cognitive dysfunction.","Qin, Yuan-yuan; Xu, Ping; Wu, Tong; Qian, Chao-qun; Fan, Yi-lin; Gen, Dong-hao; Zhu, Liang; Kong, Wei-min; Yang, Han-yu; Xu, Feng; Yang, Yi-ting; Liu, Li; Liu, Xiao-dong",Acta Pharmacol Sin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7470810/,175

12867,Bile duct ligation enhances AZT CNS toxicity partly by impairing the expression and function of BCRP in rat brain,2019-05-29,"Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease, which causes a tremendous socioeconomic burden. PD patients are suffering from debilitating motor and nonmotor symptoms. Cardinal motor symptoms of PD, including akinesia, bradykinesia, resting tremor, and rigidity, are caused by the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. In addition, decreased amounts of dopamine (DA) level in the basal ganglia induces numerous adaptive changes at the cellular and synaptic levels in the basal ganglia circuits. These cellular and synaptic adaptations are believed to underlie the emergence and propagation of correlated, rhythmic pattern of activity throughout the interconnected cortico-basal ganglia-thalamocortical network. The widespread pathological pattern of brain activity is closely linked to the devastating motor symptoms of PD. Accumulating evidence suggests that both dopaminergic degeneration and the associated abnormal cellular and circuit activity in the basal ganglia drive the motor symptoms of PD. In this short review I summarize the recent advances in our understanding of synaptic and cellular alterations in two basal ganglia nuclei (i.e. the striatum and the subthalamic nucleus) following a complete loss of DA, and in our conceptual understanding of the cellular and circuit bases for the pathological pattern of brain activity in parkinsonian state.","Chu, Hong-Yuan",Acta Pharmacol Sin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7470833/,175

SUBJECTS/METHODS: We followed 185,638 participants of three large US prospective cohorts biennially (1976–2016, 1986–2016 and 1991–2017). Deciles of three low-carbohydrate-diet scores were calculated to represent adherence to diets lower in carbohydrate and higher in protein and fat from any source, animal sources or plant sources. We confirmed POAG cases (n = 2112) by medical record review and used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate multivariable-adjusted relative risks (MVRRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: There was no association between the three types of low-carbohydrate-diet scores and POAG: the MVRR for POAG in the highest vs. lowest deciles was 1.13 (95% CI, 0.91–1.39; P(trend) = 0.40) for the overall score; 1.10 (95% CI, 0.89–1.35; P(trend) = 0.38) for the animal score and 0.96 (95% CI, 0.79–1.18; P(trend) = 0.88) for the vegetable score. No differential associations by IOP level was found (P(heterogeneity) ≥ 0.06). However, the vegetable score showed a suggestive inverse association with early paracentral VF loss (highest vs. lowest decile MVRR = 0.78 [95% CI, 0.55–1.10]; P(trend) = 0.12) but not with peripheral VF loss only (MVRR = 1.09 [95% CI, 0.83–1.44]; P(trend) = 0.14; P(heterogeneity) = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Low-carbohydrate diets were not associated with risk of POAG. Our data suggested that higher consumption of fat and protein from vegetable sources substituting for carbohydrates was associated with lower risk of the POAG subtype with initial paracentral VF loss.","Hanyuda, Akiko; Rosner, Bernard A.; Wiggs, Janey L.; Willett, Walter C.; Tsubota, Kazuo; Pasquale, Louis R.; Kang, Jae H.",Eye (Lond),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7470850/,175

Combining nanomedicines with immunotherapy aims to reinforce the cancer-immunity cycle, via potentiating key steps in the immune reaction cascade, namely antigen release, antigen processing, antigen presentation, and immune cell-mediated killing. Combination nano-immunotherapy can be realized via three targeting strategies, i.e., by targeting cancer cells, targeting the tumor immune microenvironment, and targeting the peripheral immune system. The clinical potential of nano-immunotherapy has recently been demonstrated in a phase III trial in which nano-albumin paclitaxel (Abraxane®) was combined with atezolizumab (Tecentriq®) for the treatment of patients suffering from advanced triple-negative breast cancer. In the present paper, besides strategies and initial (pre)clinical success stories, we also discuss several key challenges in nano-immunotherapy.

In traditional Chinese medicine, a large portion of patients with cancer cachexia was diagnosed as spleen deficiency syndrome and treated with tonifying TCMs that produce clinic benefits. In this study we established a new animal model of spleen deficiency and cancer cachexia in mice and evaluated the therapeutic effects of atractylenolide I, an active component of tonifying TCM BaiZhu, in the mouse model. Cancer cachexia was induced in male BALB/c mice by inoculation of mouse C26 colon adenocarcinoma cells, whereas spleen deficiency syndrome was induced by treating the mice with spleen deficiency-inducing factors, including limited feeding, fatigue, and purging. The mouse model was characterized by both cachexia and spleen deficiency characteristics, including significant body weight loss, cancer growth, muscle atrophy, fat lipolysis, spleen, and thymus atrophy as compared with healthy control mice, cancer cachexia mice, and spleen deficiency mice. Oral administration of atractylenolide I (20 mg· kg(−1)per day, for 30 days) significantly ameliorated the reduction in body weight and atrophy of muscle, fat, spleen, and thymus in mice with spleen deficiency and cachexia.

There is no effective vaccine or antiviral drug available to date to prevent or treat dengue disease. Recently, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), a class of polymerases involved in the synthesis of complementary RNA strands using single-stranded RNA, has been proposed as a promising drug target. Hence, we screened new molecules against DENV RdRp using our previously constructed virtual screening method. Mol-5, [1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine derivative, was screened out from an antiviral compound library (~8000 molecules). Using biophysical methods, we confirmed the direct interactions between mol-5 and purified DENV RdRp protein. In luciferase assay, mol-5 inhibited NS5-RdRp activity with an IC(50) value of 1.28 ± 0.2 μM. In the cell-based cytopathic effect (CPE) assay, mol-5 inhibited DENV2 infectivity with an EC(50) value of 4.5 ± 0.08 μM. Mol-5 also potently inhibited DENV2 RNA replication as observed in immunofluorescence assay and qRT-PCR. Both the viral structural (E) and non-structural (NS1) proteins of DENV2 were dose-dependently decreased by treatment with mol-5 (2.5–10 μM). Mol-5 treatment suppressed DENV2-induced inflammation in host cells, but had no direct effect on host defense (JAK/STAT-signaling pathway).

To address this task, a variety of docking tools have been developed. Most of them focus on docking in the preset binding sites given by users.

Its mutations occur in almost all tumor types, and KRAS mutant cancer is still lack of effective therapy. Prenyl-binding protein phosphodiesterase-δ (PDEδ) is required for the plasma membrane association and subsequent activation of KRAS oncogenic signaling. Recently, targeting PDEδ has provided new promise for KRAS mutant tumors. However, the therapeutic potential of PDEδ inhibition remains obscure. In this study, we explored how PDEδ inhibition was responded in KRAS mutant cancer cells, and identified KRAS mutant subset responsive to PDEδ inhibition. We first performed siRNA screen of KRAS growth dependency of a small panel of human cancer lines, and identified a subset of KRAS mutant cancer cells that were highly dependent on KRAS signaling. Among these cells, only a fraction of KRAS-dependent cells responded to PDEδ depletion, though KRAS plasma membrane association was effectively impaired. We revealed that the persistent RAF/MEK/ERK signaling seemed responsible for the lack of response to PDEδ depletion. A kinase array further identified that the feedback activation of EPH receptor A2 (EPHA2) accounted for the compensatory activation of RAF/MEK/ERK signaling in these cells. Simultaneous inhibition of EPHA2 and PDEδ led to the growth inhibition of KRAS mutant cancer cells. Together, this study gains a better understanding of PDEδ-targeted therapeutic strategy and suggests the combined inhibition of EPHA2 and PDEδ as a potential therapy for KRAS mutant cancer.","Chen, Yue-hong; Lv, Hao; Shen, Ning; Wang, Xiao-min; Tang, Shuai; Xiong, Bing; Ding, Jian; Geng, Mei-yu; Huang, Min",Acta Pharmacol Sin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7471410/,175

Our previous study shows that berberine (BBR) hampers the nuclear-to-cytosolic translocation of high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) in the process of poststroke inflammation. In this study, we explored the role of lncRNA metastasis‐associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (Malat1) in the process of BBR-induced inhibition of HMGB1 in ischemic brain. Before the 60-min MCAO surgery, the mice were pretreated with BBR (50 mg· kg(−1) per day, ig) for 14 days or ICV injected with specific lentiviral vector or shRNA. We showed that MCAO caused marked increase in the expression Malat1 and HMGB1 in the ipsilateral cortex, which was significantly attenuated by pretreatment with BBR. Knockdown of Malat1 attenuated the inflammatory injury after brain ischemia, whereas overexpression of Malat1 exacerbated ischemic brain inflammation. Overexpression of Malat1 also reversed BBR-induced reduction of HMGB1 and proinflammatory cytokines. The above results suggested a potential correlation between Malat1 and stroke inflammation. Based on informatics analysis we predicted that HMGB1 was a direct downstream target of miR-181c-5p, whereas Malat1 acted as a competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) for miR-181c-5p targeted the 3′-UTR of HMGB1 to promote inflammation after ischemic stroke. Knockdown of Malat1 significantly decreased HMGB1 level, which could be abrogated by transfection with miR-181c-5p inhibitors. Taken together, our results demonstrate for the first time that Malat1/miR-181c-5p/HMGB1 axis may be a key pathway of BBR-induced antiinflammation effects in stroke, and they may provide a novel avenue for targeted therapy.","Cao, Ding-wen; Liu, Man-man; Duan, Rui; Tao, Yi-fu; Zhou, Jun-shan; Fang, Wei-rong; Zhu, Jun-rong; Niu, Li; Sun, Jian-guo",Acta Pharmacol Sin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7471439/,175

In this study we investigated the anti-neuroinflammation effect of isosibiricin, a natural coumarin compound isolated from medicinal plant Murraya exotica. We showed that isosibiricin (10−50 μM) dose-dependently inhibited lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced BV-2 microglia activation, evidenced by the decreased expression of inflammatory mediators, including nitrite oxide (NO), tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-18 (IL-18).

Garcinol, a natural compound extracted from Gambogic genera, is a histone acetyltransferase (HAT) inhibitor that has shown anticancer activities such as cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induction. In this study, we investigated the effects of garcinol on the metastasis of esophageal cancer in vitro and in vivo. We found that garcinol (5–15 μM) dose-dependently inhibited the migration and invasion of human esophageal cancer cell lines KYSE150 and KYSE450 in wound healing, transwell migration, and Matrigel invasion assays. Furthermore, garcinol treatment dose-dependently decreased the protein levels of p300/CBP (transcriptional cofactors and HATs) and p-Smad2/3 expression in the nucleus, thus impeding tumor cell proliferation and metastasis. Knockdown of p300 could inhibit cell metastasis, but CBP knockdown did not affect the cell mobility. It has been reported that TGF-β1 stimulated the phosphorylation of Smad2/3, which directly interact with p300/CBP in the nucleus, and upregulating HAT activity of p300. We showed that garcinol treatment dose-dependently suppressed TGF-β1-activated Smad and non-Smad pathway, inhibiting esophageal cancer cell metastasis. In a tail vein injection pulmonary metastasis mouse model, intraperitoneal administration of garcinol (20 mg/kg) or 5-FU (20 mg/kg) significantly decreased the number of lung tumor nodules and the expression levels of Ki-67, p300, and p-Smad2/3 in lung tissues.

A recent study reported that nimesulide (NIM) could increase the liver injury risk of methotrexate. The latter was mainly metabolized by AOX to form hepatotoxic 7-hydroxymethotrexate (7-OH MTX). Thus, we speculated that NIM could induce AOX. In this study, we investigated the potential induction of AOX activity by NIM using methotrexate as the probe substrate. Treatment of primary human and rat hepatocytes with NIM (20 μM) for 24 h caused a 2.0- and 3.1-fold, respectively, increase in 7-OH MTX formation. Oral administration of NIM (100 mg·kg(−1)·d(−1), for 5 days) to rats significantly increased the systematic exposure (6.5-fold), liver distribution (2.5-fold), and excretion (5.2-fold for urinary excretion and 2.1-fold for fecal excretion) of 7-OH MTX.

12936,Huperzine A ameliorates obesity-related cognitive performance impairments involving neuronal insulin signaling pathway in mice,2019-06-18,"Cadmium (Cd) is a nonessential heavy metal and a prevalent environmental toxin that has been shown to induce significant cardiomyocyte apoptosis in neonatal murine engineered cardiac tissues (ECTs). In contrast, zinc (Zn) is a potent metallothionein (MT) inducer, which plays an important role in protection against Cd toxicity. In this study, we investigated the protective effects of Zn against Cd toxicity in ECTs and explore the underlying mechanisms. ECTs were constructed from neonatal ventricular cells of wild-type (WT) mice and mice with global MT gene deletion (MT-KO). In WT-ECTs, Cd (5−20 μM) caused a dose-dependent toxicity that was detected within 8 h evidenced by suppressed beating, apoptosis, and LDH release; Zn (50−200 μM) dose-dependently induced MT expression in ECTs without causing ECT toxicity; co-treatment of ECT with Zn (50 µM) prevented Cd-induced toxicity. In MT-KO ECTs, Cd toxicity was enhanced; but unexpectedly, cotreatment with Zn provided partial protection against Cd toxicity. Furthermore, Cd, but not Zn, significantly activated Nrf2 and its downstream targets, including HO-1; inhibition of HO-1 by a specific HO-1 inhibitor, ZnPP (10 µM), significantly increased Cd-induced toxicity, but did not inhibit Zn protection against Cd injury, suggesting that Nrf2-mediated HO-1 activation was not required for Zn protective effect.

12940,Zinc protects against cadmium-induced toxicity in neonatal murine engineered cardiac tissues via metallothionein-dependent and independent mechanisms,2019-11-25,"Schizandrol A (SA) is an bioactive component isolated from the Schisandra chinensis (Turcz.) Baill., which has been used as a remedy to prevent oxidative injury. However, whether the cardioprotective effect of SA is associated with regulating endogenous metabolites remains unclear, thus we performed comprehensive metabolomics profiling in acute myocardial ischemia (AMI) mice following SA treatment. AMI was induced in ICR mice by coronary artery ligation, then SA (6 mg·kg(−1)·d(−1), ip) was administered. SA treatment significantly decreased the infarct size, preserved the cardiac function, and improved the biochemical indicators and cardiac pathological alterations. Moreover, SA (10, 100 M) significantly decreased the apoptotic index in OGD-treated H8c2 cardiomycytes in vitro. By using HPLC-Q-TOF/MS, we conducted metabonomics analysis to screen the significantly changed endogenous metabolites and construct the network in both serum and urine. The results revealed that SA regulated the pathways of glycine, serine and threonine metabolism, lysine biosynthesis, pyrimidine metabolism, arginine and proline metabolism, cysteine and methionine metabolism, valine, leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis under the pathological conditions of AMI. Furthermore, we selected the regulatory enzymes related to heart disease, including ecto-5’-nucleotidase (NT5E), guanidinoacetate N-methyltransferase (GAMT), platelet-derived endothelial cell growth factor (PD-ECGF) and methionine synthase (MTR), for validation. In addition, SA was found to facilitate PI3K/Akt activation and inhibit the expression of NOX2 in AMI mice and OGD-treated H9c2 cells. In conclusion, we have elucidated SA-regulated endogenous metabolic pathways and constructed a regulatory metabolic network map. Furthermore, we have validated the new potential therapeutic targets and underlying molecular mechanisms of SA against AMI, which might provide a reference for its future application in cardiovascular diseases.","Lai, Qiong; Yuan, Guang-ying; Wang, Hao; Liu, Ze-liang; Kou, Jun-ping; Yu, Bo-yang; Li, Fang",Acta Pharmacol Sin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7471477/,175
12941,Prostaglandin E1 attenuates high glucose-induced apoptosis in proximal renal tubular cells by inhibiting the JNK/Bim pathway,2019-11-04,"Abnormal growth of the intimal layer of blood vessels (neointima formation) contributes to the progression of atherosclerosis and in-stent restenosis. Recent evidence shows that the 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO), a mitochondrial membrane protein, is involved in diverse cardiovascular diseases. In this study we investigated the role of endogenous TSPO in neointima formation after angioplasty in vitro and in vivo. We established a vascular injury model in vitro by using platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) to stimulate rat thoracic aortic smooth muscle cells (A10 cells). We found that treatment with PDGF-BB (1–20 ng/mL) dose-dependently increased TSPO expression in A10 cells, which was blocked in the presence of PKC inhibitor or MAPK inhibitor. Overexpression of TSPO significantly promoted the proliferation and migration in A10 cells, whereas downregulation of TSPO expression by siRNA or treatment with TSPO ligands PK11195 or Ro5-4864 (10(4) nM) produced the opposite effects. Furthermore, we found that PK11195 (10−10(4) nM) dose-dependently activated AMPK in A10 cells. PK11195-induced inhibition on the proliferation and migration of PDGF-BB-treated A10 cells were abolished by compound C (an AMPK-specific inhibitor, 10(3) nM). In rats with balloon-injured carotid arteries, TSPO expression was markedly upregulated in the carotid arteries. Administration of PK11195 (3 mg/kg every 3 days, ip), starting from the initial balloon injury and lasting for 2 weeks, greatly attenuated carotid neointima formation by suppressing balloon injury-induced phenotype switching of VSMCs (increased α-SMA expression). These results suggest that TSPO is a vascular injury-response molecule that promotes VSMC proliferation and migration and is responsible for the neointima formation after vascular injury, which provides a novel therapeutic target for various cardiovascular diseases including atherosclerosis and restenosis.","Wu, Lian-pan; Gong, Zheng-fan; Wang, He; Zhou, Zhong-shu; Zhang, Ming-ming; Liu, Chao; Ren, Hong-mei; Yang, Jian; Han, Yu; Zeng, Chun-yu",Acta Pharmacol Sin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7471478/,175

The value of data from such research is greatly enhanced if this reference standard is consistent across time and geography. Adherence to common standards and practices is a prerequisite to achieve this. The rationale for proposed research standards and procedures for the preparation, staining and microscopic examination of blood films for malaria parasites is presented here with the aim of improving the consistency and reliability of malaria microscopy performed in such studies. These standards constitute the core of a quality management system for clinical research studies employing microscopy as a reference standard.

The riddle how αβ TCRs are triggered by specific peptides presented in the context of MHC was elucidated some time ago. In contrast, the mechanisms that underlie antigen recognition by γδ TCRs are still baffling the scientific community. It is clear that activation of γδ TCRs does not necessarily depend on MHC antigen presentation. To date, diverse and largely host-cell-derived molecules have been identified as cognate antigens for the γδ TCR. However, for most γδ TCRs, the activating ligand is still unknown and many open questions with regard to physiological relevance and generalizable concepts remain. Especially the question of how γδ T cells can distinguish homeostatic from stress conditions via their TCR remains largely unresolved. Recent discoveries in the field might have paved the way towards a better understanding of antigen recognition by the γδ TCR and have made it conceivable to revise the current knowledge and contextualize the new findings.","Deseke, Malte; Prinz, Immo",Cell Mol Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7608190/,175

We conducted the first systematic review and meta-analysis of the adverse effects of CBD across all medical indications. Double-blind randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials lasting ≥7 days were included. Twelve trials contributed data from 803 participants to the meta-analysis. Compared with placebo, CBD was associated with an increased likelihood of withdrawal for any reason (OR 2.61, 95% CI: 1.38–4.96) or due to adverse events (OR 2.65, 95% CI: 1.04–6.80), any serious adverse event (OR 2.30, 95% CI: 1.18–4.48), serious adverse events related to abnormal liver function tests (OR 11.19, 95% CI: 2.09–60.02) or pneumonia (OR 5.37, 95% CI: 1.17–24.65), any adverse event (OR 1.55, 95% CI: 1.03–2.33), adverse events due to decreased appetite (OR 3.56, 95% CI: 1.94–6.53), diarrhoea (OR 2.61, 95% CI: 1.46–4.67), somnolence (OR 2.23, 95% CI: 1.07–4.64) and sedation (OR 4.21, 95% CI: 1.18–15.01). Associations with abnormal liver function tests, somnolence, sedation and pneumonia were limited to childhood epilepsy studies, where CBD may have interacted with other medications such as clobazam and/or sodium valproate. After excluding studies in childhood epilepsy, the only adverse outcome associated with CBD treatment was diarrhoea (OR 5.03, 95% CI: 1.44–17.61). In summary, the available data from clinical trials suggest that CBD is well tolerated and has relatively few serious adverse effects, however interactions with other medications should be monitored carefully. Additional safety data from clinical trials outside of childhood epilepsy syndromes and from studies of over-the-counter CBD products are needed to assess whether the conclusions drawn from clinical trials can be applied more broadly.","Chesney, Edward; Oliver, Dominic; Green, Alastair; Sovi, Simina; Wilson, Jack; Englund, Amir; Freeman, Tom P.; McGuire, Philip",Neuropsychopharmacology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7608221/,175

One option to address this challenge is to offer selected patients immediate sequential bilateral cataract surgery (ISBCS). This study aims to investigate patient and operative characteristics for ISBCS and delayed bilateral cataract surgery (DSCS) in the UK. METHODS: Data were analysed from the Royal College of Ophthalmologists’ National Ophthalmology Database Audit (NOD) of cataract surgery. Eligible patients were those undergoing bilateral cataract extraction from centres with a record of at least one ISBCS operation between 01/04/2010 and 31/08/2018. Variable frequency comparison was undertaken with chi-square tests. RESULTS: During the study period, 1073 patients had ISBCS and 248,341 DSCS from 73 centres. A higher proportion of ISBCS patients were unable to lie flat (11.3% vs. 1.8%; p < 0.001), unable to cooperate (9.7% vs. 2.7%; p < 0.001); underwent general anaesthesia (58.7% vs. 6.6% (p < 0.001)); had brunescent/white/mature cataracts (odds ratio (OR) 5.118); no fundal view/vitreous opacities (OR 8.381); had worse pre-operative acuity 0.60 LogMAR ISBCS vs. 0.50 (first) and 0.40 (second eye) DSCS and were younger (mean ages, 71.5 vs. 75.6 years; p < 0.001). Posterior capsular rupture (PCR) rates adjusted for case complexity were comparable (0.98% ISBCS and 0.78% DSCS). CONCLUSIONS: ISBCS was performed on younger patients, with difficulty cooperating and lying flat, worse pre-operative vision, higher rates of known PCR risk factors and more frequent use of general anaesthesia than DSCS in centres recorded on NOD.","Buchan, John C.; Donachie, Paul H.

Many of these functions are regulated by μ-opioid receptor (MOR) system. Preclinical, in vivo, and post-mortem studies have however yielded inconclusive results regarding the role of the MOR in depression and anxiety. Moreover, it is not known whether alterations in MOR are already present in subclinical depression and anxiety. In a large-scale retrospective cross-sectional study we pooled data from 135 (113 males and 22 females) healthy subjects whose brain’s MOR availability was measured with positron emission tomography (PET) using an agonist radioligand [(11)C]carfentanil that has high affinity for MORs. Depressive and anxious symptomology was addressed with BDI-II and STAI-X questionnaires, respectively. Both anxiety and depression scores in the subclinical range were negatively associated with MOR availability in cortical and subcortical areas, notably in amygdala, hippocampus, ventral striatum, and orbitofrontal and cingulate cortices. We conclude that dysregulated MOR availability is involved in altered mood and pathophysiology of depression and anxiety disorders.","Nummenmaa, Lauri; Karjalainen, Tomi; Isojärvi, Janne; Kantonen, Tatu; Tuisku, Jouni; Kaasinen, Valtteri; Joutsa, Juho; Nuutila, Pirjo; Kalliokoski, Kari; Hirvonen, Jussi; Hietala, Jarmo; Rinne, Juha",Neuropsychopharmacology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7608336/,175

To do so, we tested the impact of PFC-targeted tDCS on behavioral and electrophysiological markers of proactive cognitive control engagement in individuals with schizophrenia. Using a within-participants, double-blinded, sham-controlled crossover design, we recorded EEG while participants with schizophrenia completed a proactive cognitive control task (the Dot Pattern Expectancy (DPX) Task), after receiving 20 min of active prefrontal stimulation at 2 mA or sham stimulation. We hypothesized that active stimulation would enhance proactive cognitive control, leading to changes in behavioral performance on the DPX task and in activity in the gamma frequency band during key periods of the task designed to tax proactive cognitive control. The results showed significant changes in the pattern of error rates and increases in EEG gamma power as a function of tDCS condition (active or sham), that were indicative of enhanced proactive cognitive control. These findings, considered alongside our previous work in healthy adults, provides novel support for the role gamma oscillations in proactive cognitive control and they suggest that frontal tDCS may be a promising approach to enhance proactive cognitive control in schizophrenia.","Boudewyn, Megan A.; Scangos, Katherine; Ranganath, Charan; Carter, Cameron S.",Neuropsychopharmacology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7608454/,175

Since the eye develops as part of the embryo central nervous system (CNS) structure, it becomes a specialized compartment able to display symptoms of neurodegenerative diseases and has been proposed as a noninvasive approach to the early diagnosis of neurological diseases. Ocular lesions result from defects that occurred during embryogenesis and can become apparent in newborns exposed to ZIKV. Furthermore, the absence of microcephaly cannot exclude the occurrence of ocular lesions and other CNS manifestations. Considering the need for surveillance of newborns and infants with possible congenital exposure, we developed a method termed cellular imprinting proteomic assay (CImPA) to evaluate the ocular surface proteome specific to infants exposed to ZIKV during gestation compared to nonexposure. CImPA combines surface cells and fluid capture using membrane disks and a large-scale quantitative proteomics approach, which allowed the first-time report of molecular alterations such as neutrophil degranulation, cell death signaling, ocular and neurological pathways, which are associated with ZIKV infection with and without the development of congenital Zika syndrome, CZS. Particularly, infants exposed to ZIKV during gestation and without early clinical symptoms could be detected using the CImPA method.

Reducing the burden of HAIs through the observation and enforcement of infection prevention and control (IPC) practices remains a priority. Despite growing emphasis on HAI prevention in low- and middle-income countries, limited evidence is available to improve IPC practices to reduce HAIs. This study examined the perspectives of healthcare providers (HPs) and mothers in the neonatal intensive care unit on HAIs and determined the major barriers and facilitators to promoting standard IPC practices. This study draws on data from an ethnographic study using 38 in-depth interviews, four focus group discussions and participant observation conducted among HPs and mothers in neonatal intensive care units of a secondary- and tertiary-level hospital in Ghana. The qualitative data were analysed using a grounded theory approach, and NVivo 12 to facilitate coding. HPs and mothers demonstrated a modest level of understanding about HAIs. Personal, interpersonal, community, organizational and policy-level factors interacted in complex ways to influence IPC practices. HPs sometimes considered HAI concerns to be secondary in the face of a heavy clinical workload, a lack of structured systems and the quest to protect professional authority. The positive attitudes of some HPs, and peer interactions promoted standard IPC practices. Mothers expressed interest in participation in IPC activities. It however requires systematic efforts by HPs to partner with mothers in IPC. Training and capacity building of HPs, provision of adequate resources and improving communication between HPs and mothers were recommended to improve standard IPC practices. We conclude that there is a need for institutionalizing IPC policies and strengthening strategies that acknowledge and value mothers’ roles as caregivers and partners in IPC. To ensure this, HPs should be better equipped to prioritize communication and collaboration with mothers to reduce the burden of HAIs.","Sunkwa-Mills, Gifty; Rawal, Lal; Enweronu-Laryea, Christabel; Aberese-Ako, Matilda; Senah, Kodjo; Tersbøl, Britt Pinkowski",Health Policy Plan,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7649666/,175

However, predicting a conserved RNA structure remains unreliable, even when using a combination of thermodynamic stability and evolutionary covariation information. Here we present a method to predict a conserved RNA structure that combines the following three features. First, it uses significant covariation due to RNA structure and removes spurious covariation due to phylogeny. Second, it uses negative evolutionary information: basepairs that have variation but no significant covariation are prevented from occurring. Lastly, it uses a battery of probabilistic folding algorithms that incorporate all positive covariation into one structure. The method, named CaCoFold (Cascade variation/covariation Constrained Folding algorithm), predicts a nested structure guided by a maximal subset of positive basepairs, and recursively incorporates all remaining positive basepairs into alternative helices. The alternative helices can be compatible with the nested structure such as pseudoknots, or overlapping such as competing structures, base triplets, or other 3D non-antiparallel interactions. We present evidence that CaCoFold predictions are consistent with structures modeled from crystallography.","Rivas, Elena",PLoS Comput Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7657543/,175
14134,Progranulin deficiency confers resistance to autoimmune encephalomyelitis in mice,2019-08-29,"Widespread use of antibiotics has resulted in an increase in antimicrobial-resistant microorganisms. Although not all bacterial contact results in infection, patients can become asymptomatically colonized, increasing the risk of infection and pathogen transmission. Consequently, many institutions have begun active surveillance, but in non-research settings, the resulting data are often incomplete and may include non-random testing, making conventional epidemiological analysis problematic. We describe a mathematical model and inference method for in-hospital bacterial colonization and transmission of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae that is tailored for analysis of active surveillance data with incomplete observations. The model and inference method make use of the full detailed state of the hospital unit, which takes into account the colonization status of each individual in the unit and not only the number of colonized patients at any given time. The inference method computes the exact likelihood of all possible histories consistent with partial observations (despite the exponential increase in possible states that can make likelihood calculation intractable for large hospital units), includes techniques to improve computational efficiency, is tested by computer simulation, and is applied to active surveillance data from a 13-bed rehabilitation unit in New York City. The inference method for exact likelihood calculation is applicable to other Markov models incorporating incomplete observations. The parameters that we identify are the patient–patient transmission rate, pre-existing colonization probability, and prior-to-new-patient transmission probability. Besides identifying the parameters, we predict the effects on the total prevalence (0.07 of the total colonized patient-days) of changing the parameters and estimate the increase in total prevalence attributable to patient–patient transmission (0.02) above the baseline pre-existing colonization (0.05). Simulations with a colonized versus uncolonized long-stay patient had 44% higher total prevalence, suggesting that the long-stay patient may have been a reservoir of transmission. High-priority interventions may include isolation of incoming colonized patients and repeated screening of long-stay patients.","Ong, Karen M.; Phillips, Michael S.; Peskin, Charles S.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7660488/,175

In this study, we investigate the predictive capacity of preoperative parameters on the LVGLS decline seen at 1 month post transplant. Forty-six transplant subjects with 2D echocardiographic images sufficient for speckle tracking echocardiography were enrolled. We excluded patients diagnosed with cardiac allograft vasculopathy or with an episode of rejection 1 month before or after their echocardiographic examinations. The mean LVGLS was significantly reduced at 1 month when compared to 1 year following transplant (− 15.5% vs. − 19.4%, respectively, p < 0.001). The predictors of LVGLS that decline at 1 month were the LV mass z-score [odds ratio (OR) 1.452; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.007–2.095, p = 0.046], recipient age (OR 1.124; 95% CI 1.015–1.245, p = 0.025), and donor age (OR 1.081; 95% CI 1.028–1.136, p = 0.002) in the univariate logistic regression analyses. Although multivariate analysis yielded no significant predictors, higher LV mass z-scores showed a trend associated with the decline of LVGLS (p = 0.087). The donor/recipient weight ratio was associated with the LV mass z-score (R(2) = 0.412, p < 0.001).","You, Jihye; Yu, Jeong Jin; Kim, Mi Jin; Cha, Seulgi; Baek, Jae Suk; Choi, Eun Seok; Kwon, Bo Sang; Park, Chun Soo; Yun, Tae-Jin; Kim, Young-Hwue",Pediatr Cardiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7814263/,175

Although the detailed pathogenesis of diabetic cardiomyopathy remains unclear currently, mitochondrial morphological abnormality and dysfunction were observed in diabetic cardiomyopathy animal models according to much research, suggesting that mitochondrial structural and functional impairment played an integral role in the formation of diabetic cardiomyopathy. Thus, we have summarized the effect of mitochondria on the process of diabetic cardiomyopathy, including abnormal mitochondrial morphology, mitochondrial energy metabolism disorder, enhanced mitochondrial oxidative stress, mitochondrial unbalanced calcium homeostasis, and mitochondrial autophagy. Based on the above mechanisms and the related evidence, more therapeutic strategies targeting mitochondria in diabetic cardiomyopathy have been and will be proposed to delay the progression of the disease.","Bai, Jing; Liu, Chuanbin; Zhu, Pingjun; Li, Yang",Front Physiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7849834/,175

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using bioinformatics, both tissue-specific expression profiles and epigenomic profiles of some genes critical for cardiac fibrosis were examined, namely, NLRP3, MMP2, MMP9, CCN2/CTGF, AGT (encodes angiotensin II precursors) and hsa-mir-223 (post-transcriptionally regulates NLRP3). RESULTS: In monocytes, neutrophils, fibroblasts, venous cells, liver and brain, enhancers or super-enhancers were found that correlate with high expression of these genes. One enhancer extended into a silent gene neighbor. These enhancers harbored tissue-specific foci of DNA hypomethylation, open chromatin and transcription factor binding. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified previously undescribed enhancers containing hypomethylated transcription factor binding subregions that are predicted to regulate expression of these cardiac fibrosis-inducing genes.","Chandra, Sruti; Ehrlich, Kenneth C; Lacey, Michelle; Baribault, Carl; Ehrlich, Melanie",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7907962/,175

In recent years, EVs have been postulated as a relevant novel therapeutic option for cardiovascular diseases, including myocardial infarction (MI), partially outperforming cell therapy. EVs may present several desirable features, such as no tumorigenicity, low immunogenic potential, high stability, and fine cardiac reparative efficacy. Furthermore, the natural origin of EVs makes them exceptional vehicles for drug delivery. EVs may overcome many of the limitations associated with current drug delivery systems (DDS), as they can travel long distances in body fluids, cross biological barriers, and deliver their cargo to recipient cells, among others. Here, we provide an overview of the most recent discoveries regarding the therapeutic potential of EVs for addressing cardiac damage after MI. In addition, we review the use of bioengineered EVs for targeted cardiac delivery and present some recent advances for exploiting EVs as DDS. Finally, we also discuss some of the most crucial aspects that should be addressed before a widespread translation to the clinical arena.","Saludas, Laura; Oliveira, Cláudia C.; Roncal, Carmen; Ruiz-Villalba, Adrián; Prósper, Felipe; Garbayo, Elisa; Blanco-Prieto, María J.",Nanomaterials (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7996323/,175
16412,Correction for Euro Surveill. 2020;25(23),2021-03-25,"BACKGROUND: Bendamustine hydrochloride (BND HCl) is indicated for first-line treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and rituximab-refractory indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (iNHL). There are two ready-to-dilute (RTD) formulations of BND HCl on the US market: a large-volume, long-duration infusion (BND-L) and a small-volume, short-duration infusion (BND-S). It is estimated that the shorter duration infusion could result in cost savings to infusion facilities. OBJECTIVE: Estimate the one-year budget impact between BND-S and BND-L for use in the treatment of CLL and iNHL when all current BND-L utilization is replaced with BND-S, from the US infusion facility perspective. METHODS: An illustrative budget impact model estimated the change in costs associated with a projected increase from 50% to 100% market share for BND-S. The model included CLL and iNHL patient populations. Budgetary costs reflected facility expenditures on drug acquisition and administration based on recommended dosing for BND-S and BND-L. The base-case model assumptions and inputs were derived from scientific literature and publicly available resources. The total budget impact was calculated annually, along with the differences in per patient cost; one-way sensitivity analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Per-patient savings with BND-S use after the utilization shift were estimated at $2812.24 for CLL and $4769.01 for iNHL. Across both indications, the total annual incremental savings after the utilization shift were estimated at $452,209 for 250 CLL and iNHL patients in a 10,000-patient infusion facility, resulting in cost savings of $150.74 per BND HCI patient per month and $1808.84 per BND HCI patient per year. The model was sensitive to changes in proportion of patients receiving BND HCI infusions for CLL and iNHL, patient body surface area, and BND-S wholesale acquisition cost. CONCLUSION: This analysis estimated over $450,000 in annual savings for a 10,000-patient chemotherapy infusion facility following a utilization shift from 50% use of each RTD product to 100% use of BND-S in CLL and iNHL patients, driven by lower acquisition costs for BND-S and lower administration labor costs associated with rapid infusion.","James, Elizabeth; Trautman, Holly; Thompson, Stephen; Ribalov, Rinat; Choudhry, Azhar",Clinicoecon Outcomes Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7997603/,175

However, it is still not understood at the molecular level. In particular, the crystallization of cubic ice ([Formula: see text])—rather than the traditional hexagonal polytype ([Formula: see text])—has become an increasingly debated topic. Although evidence for [Formula: see text] is thought to date back almost 400 y, it is only in the last year that pure [Formula: see text] has been made in the laboratory, and these processes involved high-pressure ice phases. Since this demonstrates that pure [Formula: see text] can form, the question naturally arises if [Formula: see text] can be made from liquid water. With this in mind, we have performed a high-throughput computational screening study involving molecular dynamics simulations of nucleation on over 1,100 model substrates. From these simulations, we find that 1) many different substrates can promote the formation of pristine [Formula: see text]; 2) [Formula: see text] can be selectively nucleated for even the mildest supercooling; 3) the water contact layer’s resemblance to a face of ice is the key factor determining the polytype selectivity and nucleation temperature, independent of which polytype is promoted; and 4) substrate lattice match to ice is not indicative of the polytype obtained. Through this study, we have deepened understanding of the interplay of heterogeneous nucleation and ice I polytypism and suggest routes to [Formula: see text]. More broadly, the substrate design methodology presented here combined with the insight gained can be used to understand and control polymorphism and stacking disorder in materials in general.","Davies, Michael Benedict; Fitzner, Martin; Michaelides, Angelos",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8020660/,175
17393,Application of stem cell-derived exosomes in ischemic diseases: opportunity and limitations,2021-05-08,"The Mycobacteria are a genus of Actinobacteria that include human pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB). Active TB disease can spread by airborne transmission to healthcare workers and to their community. The HHMI SEA-PHAGES program has contributed to discovering bacteriophages that are able to infect M. smegmatis MC(2) 155, a close relative of M. tuberculosis. This collection of diverse Mycobacteriophages is an excellent resource for trialling bacteriophage-sourced enzymes in novel applications. Herein we measured the ability Mycobacteriophage endolysins to lyse their host strain when functionally fused to biodegradable polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) nanobeads. PHA nanobeads facilitate both the expression and the application of enzymes to surfaces and have been demonstrated to stabilize a wide array of proteins for practical applications whilst eliminating the challenges of traditional protein purification. We selected two Lysin A and six Lysin B homologs to be functionally fused to the polyhydroxyalkanoate synthase C (PhaC). Expression of these constructs resulted in functional lysins displayed on the surface of PHA nanobeads. The lysins thus directionally displayed on nanobeads lysed up to 79% of the M. smegmatis MC(2) 155 population using 80 mg/mL of nanobeads in pure culture. In order to determine whether the nanobeads would be effective as a protective layer in PPE we adapted a fabric-based test and observed a maximum of 1 log loss of the cell population after 5 h of exposure on a textile (91% cell lysis). Lysin B enzymes performed better than the Lysin A enzymes as a protective barrier on textiles surface assays. These results suggest that bacterial endolysins are efficient in their action when displayed on PHA nanobeads and can cause significant population mortality in as little as 45 min. Our results provide the proof-of-principle that Mycobacteriophage endolysins can be used on functionalized nanobeads where they can protect surfaces such as personal protective equipment (PPE) that routinely come into contact with aerosolised bacteria.","Davies, Courtney G.; Reilly, Kerri; Altermann, Eric; Hendrickson, Heather L.",Front Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8107382/,175

In Kenya, there are no up-to-date and localised estimates of spatial access to urban centres. We estimate the travel time to urban centres and identify marginalised populations for prioritisation and targeting. METHODS: Urban centres were mapped from the 2019 Kenya population census and combined with spatial databases of road networks, elevation, land use and travel barriers within a cost-friction algorithm to compute travel time. Seven travel scenarios were considered: i) walking only (least optimistic), ii) bicycle only, iii) motorcycle only, iv) vehicle only (most optimistic), v) walking followed by motorcycle transport, vi) walking followed by vehicle transport, and vii) walking followed by motorcycle and then vehicle transport (most pragmatic). Mean travel time, and proportion of the population within 1-hour and 2-hours of the urban centres were summarized at sub-national units (counties) used for devolved planning. Inequities were explored and correlations between the proportion of the population within 1-hour of an urban centre and ten SDG indicators were computed. RESULTS: A total of 307 urban centres were digitised. Nationally, the mean travel time was 4.5-hours for the walking-only scenario, 1.0-hours for the vehicle only (most optimistic) scenario and 1.5-hours for the walking-motorcycle-vehicle (most pragmatic) scenario. Forty-five per cent (21.3 million people) and 87% (41.6 million people) of Kenya’s population resided within 1-hour of the nearest urban centre for the least optimistic and most pragmatic scenarios respectively. Over 3.2 million people were considered marginalised or living outside the 2-hour threshold in the pragmatic scenario, 16.0 million Kenyans for walking only, and 2.2 million for the most optimistic scenario. County-level spatial access was highly heterogeneous ranging between 8%-100% and 32%-100% of people within the 1-hour threshold for the least and most optimistic scenarios, respectively. Counties in northern and eastern parts of Kenya were generally most marginalised. The correlation coefficients for nine SDG indicators ranged between 0.45 to 0.78 and were statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Travel time to urban centres in Kenya is heterogeneous. Therefore, marginalised populations should be prioritised during resource allocation and policies should be formulated to enhance equitable access to public services and opportunities in urban areas.","Macharia, Peter M.; Mumo, Eda; Okiro, Emelda A.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8127925/,175

The objective of this study was to recognize and characterize the most vulnerable populations at high risk of SUD mortality in the U.S., and to identify the locations where these vulnerable population are located. We obtained the most recent available mortality data for the U.S. population aged 15–84 (2005–2017) from the Centers for Diseases and Prevention (CDC). Our analysis focused on the unintentional substance poisoning to estimate SUD mortality. We computed health-related comorbidities and socioeconomic association with the SUD distribution. We identified the most affected populations and conducted a geographical clustering analysis to identify places with increased concentration of SUD related deaths. From 2005–2017, 463,717 SUD-related deaths occurred in the United States. White population was identified with the highest SUD death proportions. However, there was a surge of the SUD epidemic in the Black male population, with a sharp increase in the SUD-related death rate since 2014. We also found that an additional average day of mental distress might increase the relative risk of SUD-related mortality by 39%. The geographical distribution of the epidemic showed clustering in the West and Mid-west regions of the U.S. In conclusion, we found that the SUD epidemic in the U.S. is characterized by the emergence of several micro-epidemics of different intensities across demographic groups and locations within the country.

Currently, there is a lack of understanding of the MPP's potential harm to an already highly traumatized population. We sought to understand health impacts of this policy, including exposure to continued trauma. Methods: The University of Southern California (USC)'s Keck Human Rights Clinic analyzed de-identified legal declarations and forensic medical affidavits of 11 asylum seekers subjected to MPP. A deductive, thematic analysis was performed to understand the health impact and traumas experienced, and instances of each subtheme were counted by utilizing content analysis methodology. Results: Case analysis identified a total of 36 subthemes. Trauma subthemes included physical assault, psychological abuse, violence against family/friends, witnessed violence, sexual violence, and escalation. Perpetrator subthemes included gang, paramilitary, intimate partner, family, state, and unknown/other. Stress subthemes included despondency and social isolation. Security subthemes included reach of perpetrator, impunity of perpetrator, continued fear of persecution, fear of return, lack of safety, and reliance on strangers. Social determinants of health subthemes included tenuous housing, financial support, food insecurity, health care access, access to employment, and hazardous conditions. Psychological sequelae included anxiety, depressive, post-trauma, and suicidality; physical sequelae included dental, neurological, and dermatological sequelae. Conclusion: The MPP caused harm among these 11 cases evaluated. Harm resulted from continued trauma, worsening social determinants of health, and continued presence of fear and insecurity. The MPP may increase the risk of re-traumatization as well as detract from asylum seekers' ability to heal from pre-migration trauma.","Silverstein, Madeleine C.; Long, Rebecca F.P.; Burner, Elizabeth; Parmar, Parveen; Schneberk, Todd W.",Health Equity,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8175263/,175

However, its physiological function in viral pathogenesis remains poorly defined. Herein, we report that MSR1 facilitates vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) infection in the central nervous system. Msr1-deficient (Msr1(−/−)) mice presented reduced morbidity, mortality, and viral loads in the spinal cord following lethal VSV infection, along with normal viremia and innate immune responses, compared to Msr1(+/−) littermates and wild-type mice. Msr1 expression was most significantly upregulated in the spinal cord, the predominant target of VSV. Mechanistically, through its extracellular domains, MSR1 interacted with VSV surface glycoprotein and facilitated its cellular entry in a low-density lipoprotein receptor-dependent manner. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that MSR1 serves as a cofactor for VSV cellular entry and facilitates its infection preferentially in the spinal cord.","Yang, Duomeng; Lin, Tao; Li, Cen; Harrison, Andrew G.; Geng, Tingting; Wang, Penghua",iScience,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8208900/,175

We aimed to establish whether inhibition of these pathways with denosumab or alendronic acid could reduce disease progression in aortic stenosis. METHODS: In a single-center, parallel group, double-blind randomized controlled trial, patients >50 years of age with calcific aortic stenosis (peak aortic jet velocity >2.5 m/s) were randomized 2:1:2:1 to denosumab (60 mg every 6 months), placebo injection, alendronic acid (70 mg once weekly), or placebo capsule. Participants underwent serial assessments with Doppler echocardiography, computed tomography aortic valve calcium scoring, and (18)F-sodium fluoride positron emission tomography and computed tomography. The primary end point was the calculated 24-month change in aortic valve calcium score. RESULTS: A total of 150 patients (mean age, 72±8 years; 21% women) with calcific aortic stenosis (peak aortic jet velocity, 3.36 m/s [2.93–3.82 m/s]; aortic valve calcium score, 1152 AU [655–2065 AU]) were randomized and received the allocated trial intervention: denosumab (n=49), alendronic acid (n=51), and placebo (injection n=25, capsule n=25; pooled for analysis). Serum C-terminal telopeptide, a measure of bone turnover, halved from baseline to 6 months with denosumab (0.23 [0.18–0.33 µg/L] to 0.11 µg/L [0.08–0.17 µg/L]) and alendronic acid (0.20 [0.14–0.28 µg/L] to 0.09 µg/L [0.08–0.13 µg/L]) but was unchanged with placebo (0.23 [0.17–0.30 µg/L] to 0.26 µg/L [0.16–0.31 µg/L]). There were no differences in 24-month change in aortic valve calcium score between denosumab and placebo (343 [198–804 AU] versus 354 AU [76–675 AU]; P=0.41) or alendronic acid and placebo (326 [138–813 AU] versus 354 AU [76–675 AU]; P=0.49). Similarly, there were no differences in change in peak aortic jet velocity or (18)F-sodium fluoride aortic valve uptake. CONCLUSIONS: Neither denosumab nor alendronic acid affected progression of aortic valve calcification in patients with calcific aortic stenosis.

Preoperative multi-phase abdominal computed tomography (CT) is often used for detecting lesions and classifying histologic subtypes of renal tumor to avoid unnecessary biopsy or surgery. However, there exists inter-observer variability due to subtle differences in the imaging features of tumor subtypes, which makes decisions on treatment challenging. While deep learning has been recently applied to the automated diagnosis of renal tumor, classification of a wide range of subtype classes has not been sufficiently studied yet. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end deep learning model for the differential diagnosis of five major histologic subtypes of renal tumors including both benign and malignant tumors on multi-phase CT. Our model is a unified framework to simultaneously identify lesions and classify subtypes for the diagnosis without manual intervention. We trained and tested the model using CT data from 308 patients who underwent nephrectomy for renal tumors. The model achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.889, and outperformed radiologists for most subtypes. We further validated the model on an independent dataset of 184 patients from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA). The AUC for this dataset was 0.855, and the model performed comparably to the radiologists.

18651,Booster immunization with a fractional dose of Prevnar 13 affects cell-mediated immune response but not humoral immunity in CD-1 mice,2021-06-16,"BACKGROUND: Zika virus (ZIKV) infection and ZIKV epidemic have been continuously spreading silently throughout the world and its associated microcephaly and other serious congenital neurological complications poses a significant global threat to public health. Type I interferon response to ZIKV infection in host cells suppresses viral replication by inducing the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). METHODS: The study aims to demonstrate the anti-ZIKV mechanism of PARP11. PARP11 knock out and overexpressing A549 cell lines were constructed to evaluate the anti-ZIKV function of PARP11. PARP11(−/−), PARP12(−/−) and PARP11(−/−)PARP12(−/−) HEK293T cell lines were constructed to explain the synergistic effect of PARP11 and PARP12 on NS1 and NS3 protein degradation. Western blotting, immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation assay were performed to illustrate the interaction between PARP11 and PARP12. RESULTS: Both mRNA and protein levels of PARP11 were induced in WT but not IFNAR1(−/−) cells in response to IFNα or IFNβ stimulation and ZIKV infection. ZIKV replication was suppressed in cells expressed PARP11 but was enhanced in PARP11(−/−) cells. PARP11 suppressed ZIKV independently on itself PARP enzyme activity. PARP11 interacted with PARP12 and promoted PARP12-mediated ZIKV NS1 and NS3 protein degradation. CONCLUSION: We identified ADP-ribosyltransferase PARP11 as an anti-ZIKV ISG and found that it cooperated with PARP12 to enhance ZIKV NS1 and NS3 protein degradation. Our findings have broadened the understanding of the anti-viral function of ADP-ribosyltransferase family members, and provided potential therapeutic targets against viral ZIKV infection.

19125,Role of G2-S16 Polyanionic Carbosilane Dendrimer in the Prevention of Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infection In Vitro and In Vivo in Mice,2021-06-29,"BACKGROUND: The negative effect of unfavorable working conditions and long-term work stress on health has been demonstrated in previous research. To address these challenges, systematic approaches such as psychosocial risk assessments (PRA) have been developed in many countries worldwide. Despite legal obligations, psychosocial risk assessments are rarely carried out in micro and small-sized enterprises (MSE). Even though those enterprises constitute a large proportion of the general workforce, this area remains largely untouched by research. In order to enable starting points for a greater dissemination in organizational practice, the present study explores barriers and drivers of psychosocial risk assessments in micro and small-sized enterprises. METHODS: A total of 18 owners and managers from 15 micro and small-sized enterprises in North-Rhine Westphalia, Germany, were interviewed. The interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed. A qualitative approach was applied: Content analysis was used to analyze the data, using deductive as well as inductive coding techniques. RESULTS: The following barriers emerged from the interviews: Negative PRA image, stigmatization of mental health, lacking acceptance of employees, fear of excessive authority interference, ignorance of PRA, not understanding the necessity, inappropriate approach, and limited resources. The identified drivers were: Easy access to PRA material, external support from experts, renaming the term “workplace risk assessment”, understanding content and benefit of PRA, simplify and revise PRA process, and noticeable consequences of PRA execution and non-execution. The results are comparable with those in larger companies. They emphasize the importance of mental health education, improving the process of psychosocial risk assessments, and the ongoing support in overcoming limited financial as well as human resources. CONCLUSIONS: To improve implementation of PRA in organizational practice, a simplification of the process is proposed, accompanied by information campaigns and an improvement in the health literacy of owners and managers of MSE. In view of the results, the full revision of the PRA approach should also be considered.

19199,An acquired acyltransferase promotes Klebsiella pneumoniae ST258 respiratory infection,2021-06-01,"Finance is vital for the green energy transition, but access to low cost finance is uneven as the cost of capital differs substantially between regions. This study shows how modelled decarbonisation pathways for developing economies are disproportionately impacted by different weighted average cost of capital (WACC) assumptions. For example, representing regionally-specific WACC values indicates 35% lower green electricity production in Africa for a cost-optimal 2 °C pathway than when regional considerations are ignored. Moreover, policy interventions lowering WACC values for low-carbon and high-carbon technologies by 2050 would allow Africa to reach net-zero emissions approximately 10 years earlier than when the cost of capital reduction is not considered. A climate investment trap arises for developing economies when climate-related investments remain chronically insufficient. Current finance frameworks present barriers to these finance flows and radical changes are needed so that capital is more equitably distributed.","Ameli, Nadia; Dessens, Olivier; Winning, Matthew; Cronin, Jennifer; Chenet, Hugues; Drummond, Paul; Calzadilla, Alvaro; Anandarajah, Gabrial; Grubb, Michael",Nat Commun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8245630/,175
19579,Leptin and TGF-β1 Downregulate PREP1 Expression in Human Adipose-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells and Mature Adipocytes,2021-07-13,"BACKGROUND: Targeted immunotherapy is mostly associated with cancer treatment wherein designed molecules engage signaling pathways and mutant proteins critical to the survival of the cell. One of several genetic approaches is the use of in silico methods to develop immune epitopes targeting specific antigenic regions on related mutant proteins. In a recent study we showed a functional association between the gamma retrovirus HERV-H Long Terminal Associating (HHLA1, HHLA2 and HHLA3) proteins and melanoma associated antigen of the B class proteins (MAGEB5), with a resultant decrease in expression of HLA class I and II immune variants. HLA-C and HLA-DRB5 were the main HLA class I and II Immune variants, respectively, that showed expression changes across viral samples of interest. Specific immune variants for HLA-C and HLA-DRB5 were filtered for the top ten based on their relative frequency of counts across the samples. RESULTS: Protein variants for HHLA1, HHLA2, HHLA3 and MAGEB5 were used to predict antigenic epitope peptides to immune peptide-MHC class I and II binding using artificial neural networks. For IC50 peptide scores (PS) ≥ 0.5 with a transformed binding ability between 0 and 1, the top 5 epitopes identified for all targeted genes HHLA1,2 & 3 and MAGEB5 were qualified as strong or weak binders according to the threshold. Domain analysis using NCBI Conserved Domain Database (CDD) identified HHLA2 with immunoglobulin-like domains (Ig_C1-set) and MAGEB5 with the MAGE Homology Domain (MHD). Linear regression showed a statistical correlation (P < 0.001) for HHLA2 and MAGEB5 predicted epitope peptides to HLA-C but not HLA-DRB5. The prediction model identified HLA-C variant 9 (HLA-C9, BAA08825.1 HLA-B*1511) at 1.1% as the most valuable immune target for clinical considerations. Identification of the 9-mer epitope peptide within the domain showed for HHLA2: YANRTSLFY (PS = 0.5837) and VLAYYLSSSQNTIIN (PS = 0.77) for HLA-C and HLA-DRB5, respectively and for MAGEB5, peptides: FVRLTYLEY (PS = 0.5293) and YPAHYQFLWGPRAYT (PS = 0.62) for HLA-C and HLA-DRB5, respectively. CONCLUSION: Specific immune responses to targeted epitope peptides and their prediction models, suggested co-expression and co-evolution for HHLA2 and MAGEB5 in viral related diseases. HHLA2 and MAGEB5 could be considered markers for virus related tumors and targeted therapy for oncogenic diseases.

19747,An infrared spectral biomarker accurately predicts neurodegenerative disease class in the absence of overt symptoms,2021-08-02,"BACKGROUND: Adverse attitudes and insufficient knowledge about organ donation after Circulatory Determined Death (DCD) among emergency staff can have important consequences for the proper identification of potential DCD donors. This is aided by the constant application of donation after Circulatory Determined Death policies, and the relative strength of support for this type of donation. Therefore, this study was conducted to investigate the awareness and attitude of emergency personnel about organ donation after Circulatory Determined Death. METHODS: This descriptive study was carried out with the participation of 49 physicians and 145 nurses working in the emergency departments of educational and medical centers of Tabriz University of Medical Sciences. Nurses were selected by simple random sampling, and all physicians working in the emergency departments were included in the study. The questionnaire of Knowledge and Attitude regarding Organ Donation after Circulatory Determined Death designed by Rodrigue et al. was used. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and independent samples t-test, one-way ANOVA, and chi-square test. RESULTS: Most of the nurses (62.8%) and physicians (66.7%) had a high level of knowledge about organ donation after circulatory determined death. The mean attitude score was 101.84 (SD: 9.88) out of 170 for nurses and 106.53 (SD: 11.77) for physicians. Physicians who carried organ donation cards had a more positive attitude toward organ donation after circulatory determined death. CONCLUSION: According to this study findings, knowledge and attitude of the emergency staff about organ donation was both high and positive. It is recommended to devise necessary guidelines for organ donation in Iranian emergency departments to assist in the training of colleagues in organ donation ensuring no necessary measures are missed. The results of this study would support the development of guidelines for the successful introduction of DCD in Iran.","Kondori, Jafar; Ghafouri, Rouzbeh Rajaei; Zamanzadeh, Vahid; Attari, Ahmad Mirza Aghazadeh; Large, Stephen R.; Sheikhalipour, Zahra",BMC Emerg Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8330195/,175

A potential approach to block resistance is to simultaneously inhibit WT and known escape variants of the target bacterial protein. Here, we applied an integrated computational and experimental approach to discover compounds that inhibit both WT and trimethoprim (TMP) resistant mutants of E. coli dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). We identified a novel compound (CD15-3) that inhibits WT DHFR and its TMP resistant variants L28R, P21L and A26T with IC(50) 50–75 µM against WT and TMP-resistant strains. Resistance to CD15-3 was dramatically delayed compared to TMP in in vitro evolution. Whole genome sequencing of CD15-3-resistant strains showed no mutations in the target folA locus. Rather, gene duplication of several efflux pumps gave rise to weak (about twofold increase in IC(50)) resistance against CD15-3. Altogether, our results demonstrate the promise of strategy to develop evolution drugs - compounds which constrain evolutionary escape routes in pathogens.","Zhang, Yanmin; Chowdhury, Sourav; Rodrigues, João V; Shakhnovich, Eugene",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8331180/,175
19902,Erratum for Euro Surveill. 2021;26(24),2021-07-01,"BACKGROUND: Current tuberculosis treatments leave patients with clinically significant lung injury and increased all-cause mortality post-cure. Adjunctive host-directed therapies could protect the lungs, improve long-term survival, and shorten treatment duration; however, few have been tested clinically. Therefore, we aimed to assess the safety and preliminary efficacy of four host-directed therapies for tuberculosis. METHODS: In this prospective, open-label, phase 2, randomised controlled trial, patients with pulmonary tuberculosis were recruited at three clinical sites in South Africa. Eligible patients were aged 18–65 years, HIV-1-negative, and had rifampicin-susceptible Mycobacterium tuberculosis, a sputum Xpert cycle threshold of less than 20, and moderately advanced or far advanced disease on chest radiography. By use of numbers generated in blocks of ten and stratification by site, eligible patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1:1) to receive one of the four oral host-directed treatments plus standard tuberculosis treatment or standard treatment alone (the control group). Host-directed treatments were: CC-11050 (200 mg twice daily, taken with food; day 1–112); everolimus (0·5 mg/day; day 1–112); auranofin (3 mg/day for seven doses, then 6 mg/day; day 1–112); and ergocalciferol (5 mg on day 1, then 2·5 mg on day 28 and day 56). All study participants received oral rifabutin-substituted standard tuberculosis treatment for 180 days. Patients and clinicians were not masked to treatment assignment. Spirometry and sputum culture with solid and liquid media were done at baseline and up to 180 days at specified intervals throughout treatment. The primary endpoint was safety and tolerability up to day 210. Secondary preliminary efficacy endpoints were treatment effects on sputum microbiology (culture status at day 56 and the hazard ratio for stable culture conversion up to day 180) and lung function (FEV(1) and forced vital capacity [FVC]) measured by spirometry at day 56, day 180, and day 540. Safety was analysed in the intention-to-treat population and preliminary efficacy primarily in the per-protocol population. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02968927. Post-treatment follow-up was completed in 2020. FINDINGS: Between Nov 18, 2016, and Sept 27, 2018, 200 patients were screened and randomly assigned to different treatment groups (n=40 per group, apart from n=39 in the everolimus group after one patient withdrew consent). 11 treatment-emergent serious adverse events occurred either during treatment or within 30 days after treatment discontinuation, of which three were attributable to a host-directed treatment. Life-threatening thrombocytopenia occurred in an auranofin recipient; apparent intra-abdominal sepsis leading to death occurred in another auranofin recipient and was classified as a suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction. Tuberculous spondylitis occurred as an apparent paradoxical reaction in a patient receiving ergocalciferol. Two patients in the control group had life-threatening, treatment-attributable liver injury. No treatment-emergent, treatment-attributable serious adverse events occurred in patients receiving CC-11050 or everolimus. Mean FEV(1) in the control group was 61·7% of predicted (95% CI 56·3–67·1) at baseline and 69·1% (62·3–75·8) at day 180. Patients treated with CC-11050 and everolimus had increased recovery of FEV(1) at day 180 relative to the control group (mean difference from control group 6·30%, 95% CI 0·06–12·54; p=0·048; and 6·56%, 0·18–12·95; p=0·044, respectively), whereas auranofin and ergocalciferol recipients did not. None of the treatments had an effect on FVC during 180 days of follow-up or on measures of sputum culture status over the course of the study. INTERPRETATION: CC-11050 and everolimus were safe and reasonably well tolerated as adjunctive therapies for tuberculosis, and analysis of preliminary efficacy suggests they might also enhance the recovery of FEV(1), a key measure of lung function and predictor of all-cause mortality. Further studies of these candidates are warranted.

OBJECTIVE: To identify priority domains for end-of-life care from the perspectives of AYAs, family caregivers, and clinicians, and to propose candidate quality indicators reflecting priorities. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This qualitative study was conducted from December 6, 2018, to January 5, 2021, with no additional follow-up. In-depth interviews were conducted with patients, family caregivers, and clinicians and included a content analysis of resulting transcripts. A multidisciplinary advisory group translated priorities into proposed quality indicators. Interviews were conducted at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Kaiser Permanente Northern California, Kaiser Permanente Southern California, and an AYA cancer support community (lacunaloft.org). Participants included 23 AYAs, 28 caregivers, and 29 clinicians. EXPOSURE: Stage IV or recurrent cancer. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Care priorities. RESULTS: Interviews were conducted with 23 patients (mean [SD] age, 29.3 [7.3] years; 12 men [52%]; 18 White participants [78%]), 28 family caregivers (23 women [82%]; 14 White participants [50%]), and 29 clinicians (20 women [69%]; 13 White participants [45%]). Caregivers included 22 parents (79%), 5 spouses or partners (18%), and 1 other family member (4%); the 29 clinicians included 15 physicians (52%), 6 nurses or nurse practitioners (21%), and 8 social workers or psychologists (28%). Interviews identified 7 end-of-life priority domains: attention to physical symptoms, attention to quality of life, psychosocial and spiritual care, communication and decision-making, relationships with clinicians, care and treatment, and independence. Themes were consistent across the AYA age range and participant type. Although some domains were represented in quality indicators developed for adults, unique domains were identified, as well as AYA-specific manifestations of existing domains. For example, quality of life included global quality of life; attainment of life goals, legacy, and meaning; support of personal relationships; and normalcy. Within communication and decision-making, domains included communication early in the disease course, addressing prognosis and what to expect at the end of life, and opportunity for AYAs to hold desired roles in decision-making. Care and treatment domains relevant to cancer therapy, use of life-prolonging measures, and location of death emphasized the need for preference sensitivity rather than a standard path. This finding differs from existing adult indicators that propose that late-life chemotherapy, intensive measures, and hospital death should be rare. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings of this qualitative study suggest that AYAs with cancer have priorities for care at the end of life that are not fully encompassed in existing indicators for adults. Use of new indicators for this young population may better reflect patient- and family-centered experiences of quality care.","Mack, Jennifer W.; Fisher, Lauren; Kushi, Larry; Chao, Chun R.; Vega, Brenda; Rodrigues, Gilda; Josephs, Isabel; Brock, Katharine E.; Buchanan, Susan; Casperson, Mallory; Cooper, Robert M.; Fasciano, Karen M.; Kolevska, Tatjana; Lakin, Joshua R.; Lefebvre, Anna; Schwartz, Corey M.; Shalman, Dov M.; Wall, Catherine B.; Wiener, Lori; Altschuler, Andrea",JAMA Netw Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8383130/,175

One protein in the matrisome that is common to many inflammatory diseases is the large proteoglycan versican, whose varied function is achieved through multiple isoforms and post-translational modifications of glycosaminoglycan structures. In cancer, increased levels of versican are associated with immune cell phenotype, disease prognosis and failure to respond to treatment. Whether these associations between versican expression and tumour immunity are the result of a direct role in the pathogenesis of tumours is not clear. In this review, we have focused on the role of versican in the immune response as it relates to tumour progression, with the aim of determining whether our current understanding of the immunobiology of versican warrants further study as a cancer immunotherapy target.","Hirani, Priyanka; Gauthier, Valentine; Allen, Carys E.; Wight, Thomas N.; Pearce, Oliver M.

21349,Corrigendum,2020-12-13,"Low-dose Computed Tomography (LDCT) has gained a great deal of attention in clinical procedures due to its ability to reduce the patient's risk of exposure to the X-ray radiation. However, reducing the X-ray dose increases the quantum noise and artifacts in the acquired LDCT images. As a result, it produces visually low-quality LDCT images that adversely affect the disease diagnosing and treatment planning in clinical procedures. Deep Learning (DL) has recently become the cutting-edge technology of LDCT denoising due to its high performance and data-driven execution compared to conventional denoising approaches. Although the DL-based models perform fairly well in LDCT noise reduction, some noise components are still retained in denoised LDCT images. One reason for this noise retention is the direct transmission of feature maps through the skip connections of contraction and extraction path-based DL modes. Therefore, in this study, we propose a Generative Adversarial Network with Inception network modules (InNetGAN) as a solution for filtering the noise transmission through skip connections and preserving the texture and fine structure of LDCT images. The proposed Generator is modeled based on the U-net architecture. The skip connections in the U-net architecture are modified with three different inception network modules to filter out the noise in the feature maps passing over them. The quantitative and qualitative experimental results have shown the performance of the InNetGAN model in reducing noise and preserving the subtle structures and texture details in LDCT images compared to the other state-of-the-art denoising algorithms.","Kulathilake, K.

Biofilm formation by A. baumannii is triggered by a quorum sensing cascade, and we hypothesized that fatty acids might inhibit its biofilm formation by interfering with quorum sensing. Initially, we investigated the antibiofilm activities of 24 fatty acids against A. baumannii ATCC 17978 and two clinical isolates. Among these fatty acids, two unsaturated fatty acids, nervonic and oleic acid, at 20 μg/mL significantly inhibited A. baumannii biofilm formation without affecting its planktonic cell growth (MICs were >500 μg/mL) and markedly decreased the motility of A. baumannii but had no toxic effect on the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Interestingly, molecular dynamic simulations showed that both fatty acids bind to the quorum sensing acyl homoserine lactone synthase (AbaI), and decent conformational stabilities of interactions between the fatty acids and AbaI were exhibited. Our results demonstrate that nervonic and oleic acid inhibit biofilm formation by A. baumannii strains and may be used as lead molecules for the control of persistent A. baumannii infections.","Khadke, Sagar Kiran; Lee, Jin-Hyung; Kim, Yong-Guy; Raj, Vinit; Lee, Jintae",Biomedicines,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8466663/,175

21799,Metabolic reprogramming and metabolic sensors in KSHV-induced cancers and KSHV infection,2021-09-27,"[Image: see text] Sepsis is a serious bloodstream infection where the immunity of the host body is compromised, leading to organ failure and death of the patient. In early sepsis, the concentration of bacteria is very low and the time of diagnosis is very critical since mortality increases exponentially with every hour after infection. Common culture-based methods fail in fast bacteria determination, while recent rapid diagnostic methods are expensive and prone to false positives. In this work, we present a sepsis kit for fast detection of bacteria in whole blood, here achieved by combining selective cell lysis and a sensitive colorimetric approach detecting as low as 10(3) CFU/mL bacteria in less than 5 h. Homemade selective cell lysis buffer (combination of saponin and sodium cholate) allows fast processing of whole blood in 5 min while maintaining bacteria alive (100% viability). After filtration, retained bacteria on filter paper are incubated under constant illumination with the electrochromic precursors, i.e., ferricyanide and ferric ammonium citrate. Viable bacteria metabolically reduce iron(III) complexes, initiating a photocatalytic cascade toward Prussian blue formation. As a proof of concept, we combine this method with antibiotic susceptibility testing to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) using two antibiotics (ampicillin and gentamicin). Although this kit is used to demonstrate its applicability to sepsis, this approach is expected to impact other key sectors such as hygiene evaluation, microbial contaminated food/beverage, or UTI, among others.","Narayana Iyengar, Sharath; Dietvorst, Jiri; Ferrer-Vilanova, Amparo; Guirado, Gonzalo; Muñoz-Berbel, Xavier; Russom, Aman",ACS Sens,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8477386/,175
21806,Molecular Docking and Simulation Studies of Antidiabetic Agents Devised from Hypoglycemic Polypeptide-P of Momordica charantia,2021-09-17,"BACKGROUND: The Global Point Prevalence Survey of Antimicrobial Consumption and Resistance (Global-PPS) provides a methodology to support hospitals worldwide in collecting antimicrobial use data. We aim to evaluate the impact of the Global-PPS on local antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) programmes and assess health care professionals’ educational needs and barriers for implementing AMS. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was disseminated within the Global-PPS network. The target audience consisted of hospital healthcare workers, involved in local surveillance of antimicrobial consumption and resistance. This included contacts from hospitals that already participated in the Global-PPS or were planning to do so. The survey contained 24 questions that addressed the hospital’s AMS activities, experiences conducting the PPS, as well as the learning needs and barriers for implementing AMS. RESULTS: A total of 248 hospitals from 74 countries participated in the survey, of which 192 had already conducted the PPS at least once. The survey response rate was estimated at 25%. In 96.9% of these 192 hospitals, Global-PPS participation had led to the identification of problems related to antimicrobial prescribing. In 69.3% at least one of the hospital’s AMS components was initiated as a result of Global-PPS findings. The level of AMS implementation varied across regions. Up to 43.1% of all hospitals had a formal antimicrobial stewardship strategy, ranging from 10.8% in Africa to 60.9% in Northern America. Learning needs of hospitals in high-income countries and in low-and middle-income countries were largely similar and included general topics (e.g. ‘optimising antibiotic treatment’), but also PPS-related topics (e.g. ‘translating PPS results into meaningful interventions’). The main barriers to implementing AMS programmes were a lack of time (52.7%), knowledge on good prescribing practices (42.0%), and dedicated funding (39.9%). Hospitals in LMIC more often reported unavailability of prescribing guidelines, insufficient laboratory capacity and suboptimal use of the available laboratory services. CONCLUSIONS: Although we observed substantial variation in the level of AMS implementation across regions, the Global-PPS has been very useful in informing stewardship activities in many participating hospitals.

Recently, non-invasive determination of SvO(2) (Capno-SvO(2)) using capnodynamics has shown good agreement against CO-oximetry in an animal model of modest hemodynamic changes. The purpose of the current study was to validate Capno-SvO(2) against CO-oximetry during major alterations in oxygen delivery. Furthermore, evaluating fiberoptic SvO(2) for its response to the same challenges. Eleven mechanically ventilated pigs were exposed to oxygen delivery changes: increased inhaled oxygen concentration, hemorrhage, crystalloid and blood transfusion, preload reduction and dobutamine infusion. Capno-SvO(2) and fiberoptic SvO(2) recordings were made in parallel with CO-oximetry. Respiratory quotient, needed for capnodynamic SvO(2), was measured by analysis of mixed expired gases. Agreement of absolute values between CO-oximetry and Capno-SvO(2) and fiberoptic SvO(2) respectively, was assessed using Bland–Altman plots. Ability of Capno- SvO(2) and fiberoptic SvO(2) to detect change compared to CO-oximetry was assessed using concordance analysis. The interventions caused significant hemodynamic variations. Bias between Capno-SvO(2) and CO-oximetry was + 3% points (95% limits of agreements – 7 to + 13). Bias between fiberoptic SvO(2) and CO-oximetry was + 1% point, (95% limits of agreements − 7 to + 9). Concordance rate for Capno-SvO(2) and fiberoptic SvO(2) vs. CO-oximetry was 98% and 93%, respectively. Capno-SvO(2) generates absolute values close to CO-oximetry. The performance of Capno-SvO(2) vs. CO-oximetry was comparable to the performance of fiberoptic SvO(2) vs. CO-oximetry. Capno-SvO(2) appears to be a promising tool for non-invasive SvO(2) monitoring.

Different concepts of modification within the adenovirus vector have been identified that define the mode of action against and the interaction with the tumour. Adenoviral vectors allow for genetic manipulations that restrict tumour specificity and also the expression of specific transgenes in order to support the anti-tumour effect. Additionally, replication of the virus and reinfection of neighbouring tumour cells amplify the therapeutic effect. Another important aspect in oncolytic adenovirus therapy is the virus induced cell death which is a process that activates the immune system against the tumour. This review describes which elements in adenovirus vectors have been identified for modification not only to utilize oncolytic adenovirus vectors into conditionally replicating adenoviruses (CRAds) that allow replication specifically in tumour cells but also to confer specific characteristics to these viruses. These advances in development resulted in clinical trials that are summarized based on the conceptual design.","Mantwill, Klaus; Klein, Florian Gerhard; Wang, Dongbiao; Hindupur, Sruthi Vasantamadhava; Ehrenfeld, Maximilian; Holm, Per Sonne; Nawroth, Roman",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8508870/,175

22551,Emerging Infectious Diseases and the Socio-ecological Dimension,2005-10-13,"BACKGROUND: Rapid diagnostic tests can reduce time to organism identification and susceptibility results, allowing for more rapid optimization of antibiotic therapy. We sought to determine whether a qualitative immunochromatographic assay (Alere™ PBP2a Culture Colony test) that differentiates methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) from methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) could optimize time to appropriate therapy for patients with skin and soft-tissue infections (SSTIs) and nosocomial pneumonia caused by S. aureus. METHODS: Adult patients admitted to The Johns Hopkins Hospital with a respiratory or wound culture growing S. aureus between July-October 2015 (baseline period) and July-October 2016 (intervention period) were included. The primary outcome was time to optimal antibiotic therapy from specimen collection before and after implementation of the PBP2a assay. Secondary outcomes were (1) time to antibiotic de-escalation from specimen collection, (2) length of hospital stay, and (3) number of vancomycin levels. An unadjusted analysis was conducted using Chi-square or Fisher’s exact test for categorical variables and Wilcoxon rank-sum test for continuous variables. RESULTS: 189 patients met eligibility criteria (119 baseline, 70 intervention). There were no significant differences in characteristics of patients between periods. Overall time to optimal therapy decreased during the intervention period compared with baseline (IQR 0–24.7 hours vs. 0–64.2 hours, P = 0.02). In the subset of patients with SSTIs, time to optimal and de-escalation of antibiotic therapy was reduced during the intervention period compared with baseline (IQR 0–6.6 vs. 0-70.8, P = 0.02 and IQR 0–26.5 vs. 0-65.5, P = 0.05, respectively), but not with pneumonia. Length of hospital stay (median 6 days in each, P = 0.60) and number of vancomycin levels (median 0 vs. 1, P = 0.33) were similar before and after assay implementation. CONCLUSION: There was a reduction in time to optimal antibiotic therapy after implementation of the PBP2a assay driven by changes in SSTI regimens but not pneumonia regimens. Incorporation of a rapid test to differentiate MSSA from MRSA be a useful addition to antibiotic stewardship initiatives to optimize therapy for patients with MSSA infection. DISCLOSURES: P.

22596,Emerging and Reemerging Infectious Diseases: Biocomplexity as an Interdisciplinary Paradigm,2005-10-31,"BACKGROUND: Among individuals living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), pulmonary complications are the most frequent cause of morbidity and mortality. Although bacterial and fungal pathogens are well-described etiologies of lung disease, the role of respiratory viruses remains poorly understood. We sought to describe the burden of respiratory viral illness in HIV-infected inpatients admitted to our tertiary care center. METHODS: All HIV-infected inpatients from August 2015 to March 2018 were approached if they presented with respiratory symptoms, defined as cough, dyspnea, sore throat, rhinorrhea, wheezing, or stridor. Eighty patients were enrolled. After obtaining informed consent, nasopharyngeal swabs and blood were collected. If the subject underwent bronchoscopy per the treating physician, excess bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) sample was collected. Demographic and clinical data were recorded for each subject. Multiplex PCR testing of all respiratory samples was performed. RESULTS: Of the 70 HIV-infected patients that have undergone complete analysis, 23 (33%) tested positive for respiratory viruses. Of these, 11 (48%) were positive for rhinovirus, 3 were positive for influenza A (13%), 2 for parainfluenza 3 (9%), 2 for coronavirus (9%), and one each tested positive for adenovirus, parainfluenza 4, respiratory syncytial virus and influenza B. One patient had co-infection with rhinovirus and human metapneumovirus. Patients infected with a respiratory virus had severe illness as nearly half (10/23; 48%) required intensive care, 5 (22%) required mechanical ventilation, 4 (17%) were discharged to a higher level of care, and 3 (13%) died. CONCLUSION: The role of respiratory viruses on the lung health of HIV-infected patients is poorly defined. In this study, respiratory viruses were identified in over a third of HIV-infected inpatients, representing a substantial disease burden. Moreover, these patients demonstrated significant disease severity. Given these findings, there is a need for future studies of viral infections in HIV-infected individuals to elucidate mechanisms of susceptibility to reduce the burden of pulmonary morbidity in this vulnerable population.

23432,New CLEM Method to Reveal Ultrastructural Reorganization in the Host Cell during Coronavirus Infection,2015-08-11,"BACKGROUND: Human coronaviruses (HCoVs), rhinoviruses, and non-polio enteroviruses (NPEVs) are leading causes of seasonal acute respiratory infections among children and adults, posing significant health and economic burden annually. Despite this, little is known about their epidemiological dynamics, including the role of asymptomatic shedding in transmission; the durations of virus incubation and shedding; and the effect of immune responses on risk for re-infection during the same season. We studied respiratory virus shedding in military recruits, and used mathematical models to measure pathogen-specific transmission rates and durations of incubation, shedding, and immune protection. METHODS: We tested for shedding of HCoVs, rhinoviruses, and NPEVs in nasal samples collected from 78 military recruits entering basic training and then at staggered, biweekly visits over 65 days during winter 2017. We developed a continuous-time Markov chain model for virus acquisition and clearance, and used Bayesian methods to estimate model parameters for each of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, rhinoviruses, and NPEVs. RESULTS: We observed widespread transmission of HCoV-229E, rhinoviruses, and NPEVs within the first week after entry into basic training, and a subsequent phase of transmission predominantly involving HCoV-OC43 during the second month (Figure). We estimated pre-epidemic reproductive numbers ranging from 1.97 (95% credible interval: 1.49, 2.60) for HCoV-OC43 to 5.69 (3.92, 7.98) for HCoV-229E (Table). Subjects re-acquired HCoV-229E, rhinoviruses, and NPEVs despite previous exposure; for these pathogens, we estimated reversion to pre-infection susceptibility to occur, on average, 28.5 (15.8, 49.7) days, 52.2 (22.3, 151.1), and 144.7 (61.3, 812.5) days, respectively, following clearance of viral shedding. CONCLUSION: Asymptomatic shedding is a source of transmission of common respiratory viruses in the close-contact basic training environment. Protection against re-acquisition is short-lived, and may be inadequate to prevent re-infection by rhinoviruses and NPEVs within a season. Estimated durations of shedding and incubation periods provide a basis for modeling pathogen spread and informing isolation protocols. DISCLOSURES: J.

EPA, vitamin A, and Se are important in controlling inflammation and can be supplied by oral nutritional supplements. Cod liver oil contains EPA (and other important ω-3 fatty acids), and vitamin A as well as vitamin D. Fish oil contains ω-3 fatty acids (including EPA) but no vitamins. Our clinical research demonstrates that daily supplementation with a flavored cod liver oil (which meets European purity standards) and a children’s multivitamin-mineral with trace metals, including Se, can decrease morbidity from upper respiratory tract illnesses, otitis media, and sinusitis in young children living in the United States. These supplements can be used by practitioners on an individual basis, when clinically indicated; the supplements can be purchased in the United States without a prescription. Socioeconomically disadvantaged children are at risk for micronutrient deficiencies. However, their families may not be able to afford to purchase these supplements, which are not available through Medicaid, The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, or the Food Stamp Program. If our results are confirmed in larger studies, a system change will be needed to provide these supplements to nutritionally vulnerable, socioeconomically disadvantaged children living in the United States.","Linday, Linda A.",Preventive Nutrition,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120316/,175

These infections are usually diagnosed by clinical and microbiologic studies, including cultures and serology tests. Lung biopsy is rarely used in these diagnoses. Patients with life-threatening pneumonia, especially those who are immunocompromised, are more likely to undergo lung biopsy to rule out unusual infections not easily diagnosed using conventional microbiologic methods and for which treatment strategies may be different. Pathogens more likely to be diagnosed using lung biopsy for which there are characteristic pathologic changes are highlighted in this chapter and listed in Table 4.1.","Zhang, Chen; Myers, Jeffrey L.",Atlas of Lung Pathology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120464/,175

25508,SARS,2015-07-25,"The Natural Immune System (NIS) is a distributed system that solves challenging search and response problems while operating under constraints imposed by physical space and resource availability. Remarkably, NIS search and response times do not scale appreciably with the physical size of the animal in which its search is conducted. Many distributed systems are engineered to solve analogous problems, and the NIS demonstrates how such engineered systems can achieve desirable scalability. We hypothesize that the architecture of the NIS, composed of a hierarchical decentralized detection network of lymph nodes (LN) facilitates efficient search and response. A sub-modular architecture in which LN numbers and size both scale with organism size is shown to efficiently balance tradeoffs between local antigen detection and global antibody production, leading to nearly scale-invariant detection and response. We characterize the tradeoffs as balancing local and global communication and show that similar tradeoffs exist in distributed systems like LN inspired artificial immune system (AIS) applications and peer-to-peer (P2P) systems. Taking inspiration from the architecture of the NIS, we propose a modular RADAR (Robust Adaptive Decentralized search with Automated Response) strategy for distributed systems. We demonstrate how two existing distributed systems (a LN inspired multi-robot control application and a P2P system) can be improved by a modular RADAR strategy. Such a sub-modular architecture is shown to balance the tradeoffs between local communication (within artificial LNs and P2P clusters) and global communication (between artificial LNs and P2P clusters), leading to efficient search and response.","Banerjee, Soumya; Moses, Melanie",Artificial Immune Systems,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122117/,175

This exploratory study aims to determine the nature of cyber-harassment victimization, its enablers, and the coping mechanisms that online platforms provide to prevent or stop cyber-harassment. An online survey of ninety (n = 90) LGBTQIA+ young adults of ages between 18 and 34 from South Africa reveals a high incidence of exclusion, outing and harassment, covering a wide variety of types, duration and experienced severity, taking place through text messaging and social media sites such as Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. Most LGBTQIA+ youth resort to measures such as blocking, deleting offensive content and adjusting privacy settings to cope with cyber-victimization. Worryingly, the most severe effects of harassment such as depression, drug abuse, self-harm and suicide contemplation, have significant correlations with the harassment type used, harassment duration and harassment frequency.

In Beck’s view, the modern society had deviated from (Karl Marx’s) class society or (Max Weber’s) industrial society and had developed into a social form that is highly modern, known as the “risk society.” Social theories based on unequal distribution of wealth (the functional theory, Marxism, and various kinds of postindustrial or postmodern theories that derived from it) have lost their interpretability when it comes to the crisis and inequality in the distribution of risks. Therefore, there needs to be a turn in social theories, that is to say, “risk sociology” needs to be advanced with problem awareness being “how to avoid, minimize, and direct risks or hazards systematically created as a part of modernization.”","Hu, Yi",Rural Health Care Delivery,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7139451/,175

No list of this type will ever satisfy everyone. However, the thought about who the best physicians are and were is often raised, and it certainly is pertinent in a book on blacks in medicine. We sometimes refer to standout physicians in terms of their demonstrated ability to overcome adversity while accomplishing enormous gains in their careers, against all odds in many cases. Many are called visionaries. What metrics should we use? Often the term “great” is used to describe an individual physician’s attributes. However, if greatness can be defined as extraordinary competence sustained over time, many of those who had only a relatively brief opportunity to demonstrate their expertise would not make the list, although their singular accomplishment may have been groundbreaking. So perhaps a broader criterion should be used, one that does not require a long-term application of medical prowess. I would like to suggest what that overarching criterion should be: it is the unequivocal impact that an individual physician has had in saving and rescuing the lives and health of African American and other minority, vulnerable, needy, and impoverished people, and contributing in a measurable manner to their health and well-being, either by involvement as a medical practitioner, researcher, educator, or academic standout or through leadership and activism as a champion for social justice.","Williams, Richard Allen",Blacks in Medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7182344/,175

We define a novel concept of a must location set. Intuitively, such a set includes at least one program location from every repair for a bug. Thus, it is impossible to fix the bug without changing at least one location from this set. A fault localization technique is considered a must algorithm if it returns a must location set for every buggy program and every bug in the program. We show that some traditional fault localization techniques are not must. We observe that the notion of must fault localization depends on the chosen repair scheme, which identifies the changes that can be applied to program statements as part of a repair. We develop a new algorithm for fault localization and prove that it is must with respect to commonly used schemes in automated program repair. We incorporate the new fault localization technique into an existing mutation-based program repair algorithm. We exploit it in order to prune the search space when a buggy mutated program has been generated. Our experiments show that must fault localization is able to significantly speed-up the repair process, without losing any of the potential repairs.","Rothenberg, Bat-Chen; Grumberg, Orna",Computer Aided Verification,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7363178/,175

The number of news on newspapers and on media was massive, however, this communication did not take into account properly the level of comprehension of general public of health related issues, which in turns can have a huge impact on public health and related policies. In the light of above this study aims to analyze press coverage during the COVID-19 pandemic/epidemic in Italy. METHODS: An analysis of the press and related online journal coverage during CoVID-19 was conducted. A total of 1512 articles in two months were analyzed. Two main analyses were carried out, a coding quantitative content analysis of newspapers article data and a textual analysis and a sentiment analysis using Taltac 2.10 and Voyant Tools. RESULTS: There was an overall similar idea among different newspapers, this means that both tabloids and broadsheet newspapers show an overall similar content, with a small difference on quality and tone. Results, moreover, displayed two different chronologically lead trends during the COVID-19 crisis. The first two week articles were mainly focused on the illness per se, in terms of prevention, care, cure but also fear, and anxiety; while after a while, around 2 months later newspapers were much more focused on the socio-political-economic impact that COVID-19 had on Italy and potentially could have in the closer future, also for the health organizations. CONCLUSIONS: Newspaper attitude in publishing sensationalistic articles and titles show to take small account of the effect that could potentially have on general public understanding of the issues connected to the virus. This both in the outbreak in terms of what could be the effect of the virus on their health and later on the economy of the country. More attention should be paid in analysing the impact that newspaper communication has on general public behavior and reactions.

Therefore, it is important to study computerized models for infectious detection based on CT imaging. New deep learning-based approaches are developed for CT assisted diagnosis of COVID-19. However, most of the current studies are based on a small size dataset of COVID-19 CT images as there are less publicly available datasets for patient privacy reasons. As a result, the performance of deep learning-based detection models needs to be improved based on a small size dataset. In this paper, a stacked autoencoder detector model is proposed to greatly improve the performance of the detection models such as precision rate and recall rate. Firstly, four autoencoders are constructed as the first four layers of the whole stacked autoencoder detector model being developed to extract better features of CT images. Secondly, the four autoencoders are cascaded together and connected to the dense layer and the softmax classifier to constitute the model. Finally, a new classification loss function is constructed by superimposing reconstruction loss to enhance the detection accuracy of the model. The experiment results show that our model is performed well on a small size COVID-2019 CT image dataset. Our model achieves the average accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score rate of 94.7%, 96.54%, 94.1%, and 94.8%, respectively. The results reflect the ability of our model in discriminating COVID-19 images which might help radiologists in the diagnosis of suspected COVID-19 patients.","Li, Daqiu; Fu, Zhangjie; Xu, Jun",Appl Intell,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7652058/,175

The results confirmed that spray-drying technology improves the cholesterol oxidation 2.6 times compared to pasteurized eggs. Biscuit samples showed a COPs content that is strictly related to the egg products used. Samples formulated with spray-dried eggs noticed lower amounts of COPs compared to those formulated with pasteurized eggs. It is important to stress that COPs composition was different between the two samples, underlining that the kinetic of COPs formation is dependent on the type of egg products.","Verardo, Vito; Messia, Maria Cristina; Marconi, Emanuele; Caboni, Maria Fiorenza",Foods,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7700660/,175

Infectious diseases pose a significant threat to human health as evidenced by countries continuing to grapple with several emerging and re-emerging diseases, the most recent global health threat being the SARS-CoV2 pandemic. As such, various immunotherapeutic approaches are increasingly being investigated as alternative therapies for infectious diseases, resulting in significant advances towards the uncovering of pathogen-host immunity interactions. Novel and innovative therapeutic strategies are necessary to overcome the challenges typically faced by existing infectious disease prevention and control methods such as lack of adequate efficacy, drug toxicity and the emergence of drug resistance. As evidenced by recent developments and success of pharmaceuticals such as monoclonal antibodies, immunotherapies already show abundant promise to overcome such limitations while also advancing the frontiers of medicine. In this review we summarize some of the most notable inroads made to combat infectious disease, over mainly the last 5 years, through the use of immunotherapies such as vaccines, monoclonal antibody-based therapies, T-cell-based therapies, manipulation of cytokine levels and checkpoint inhibition. Whilst its most general applications are founded in cancer treatment, advances made towards the curative treatment of HIV, tuberculosis, malaria, zika virus and, most recently COVID-19, reinforce the role of immunotherapeutic strategies in the broader field of disease control.

This practice is predicated on a historical separation of the early educational tracks of physicians and advanced practice nurses whose professions ultimately came to occupy overlapping niches within the field of anesthesia. The state of affairs has been bolstered by territorial friction between professional organizations, and by the lack of a perceived need for anesthesiologists to become involved at an early stage of nurse anesthesia education given the large number of qualified certified registered nurse anesthesia instructors available to perform this role. Anesthesiologists, however, have significant pedagogical assets to offer NAPs, including expertise in critical analysis and decision-making skills related to perioperative adverse events. In addition, introduction of anesthesiologists into preclinical NAP education has the potential to inject added academic rigor into NAPs currently transitioning to Doctor of Nursing Practice programs. Likewise, NAPs offer a professional haven for those anesthesiologists seeking new challenges in education, and a unique opportunity to shape the future of anesthesia. Most importantly, introducing anesthesiologists into the initial educational phases of the nurse anesthesia profession provides an opportunity to grow trust and understanding between these two professions that are critical for safe, healthy, and lasting partnerships in future years.","Swerdlow, Barry; Osborne-Smith, Lisa; Berry, Devon",Adv Med Educ Pract,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7751290/,175

Diagnosis is usually made by an RT-PCR test from a respiratory sample. A number of tests are available for antibody detection or assessment, including rapid, enzyme immunoassays (EIA) and neutralization. However, characterization of the antibody immune response is not well documented and the clinical significance of COVID antibodies remains largely unknown. In addition, comparison of results across different assay formats using identical samples has not been rigorously studied, making clinical interpretation of serologic tests difficult. Assessment of multiple SARS-CoV-2 antibody and neutralization assays from blood samples in COVID-19 infected patients [Image: see text] METHODS: 1–5 serial (total 33) serum or plasma samples from 14 patients who were positive for SARS-CoV-2 by EUA authorized RT-PCR assays from nasopharyngeal specimens where tested with the following COVID-19 antibody tests: LFA rapid tests (Chembio DPP IgM/IgG, SD Biosensor Standard IgM/IgG, BTNX Rapid Response IgM/IgG), and EIA tests (BioRad Platelia SARS-CoV-2 Total antibody-IgG/IgM/IgA, EuroImmun SARS-CoV-2 IgG, and EuroImmun SARS-CoV-2 IgA). See Table 1 for results and EUA. Results were recorded as positive, negative, or equivocal. Additionally, antibody neutralization was assessed on matched samples. RESULTS: Mean age of SARS-CoV-2 positive patients was 73 years (range 65–89), 11/14 had symptoms, all were male and hospitalized (6 ICU), and 3 died. Average number of days serum was collected after RT-PCR positivity was 13.5 days (range -3 to 46 d). BTNX assay was only tested on 16 samples. Among all assays, total concordance of results was 91%. When only IgG/IgM or total antibody assays were considered, concordance of results was 96% (Table). IgA specific results were discordant in 9/33 (27%) of samples compared to other assays. Two patients were negative in all assays in serial samples collected within one week of PCR positivity. Antibody neutralization was detected, but not from all samples. CONCLUSION: In general, there was good agreement among antibody detection assays. Neutralization may reflect disease outcome.

It is important to understand the epidemiology of these infections to properly treat and manage these complex patients. This study evaluates the frequency, source, and pathogens identified among SARS-CoV-2 tested patients. METHODS: This was a multi-center, retrospective cohort analysis of SARS-COV-2 tested patients from 271 US acute care facilities with >1 day inpatient admission with a discharge or death between 3/1/20–5/31/20 (BD Insights Research Database [Becton, Dickinson & Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ]). We evaluated pathogens identified from blood, respiratory tract (upper/lower), urine, intra-abdominal (IA), skin/wound and other sources and classified them with respect to Gram-negative (GN), and Gram-positive (GP) bacteria, fungi, and viruses among those SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative. RESULTS: There were 599,709 admissions with 142,054 (23.7%) patients tested. Among those SARS-CoV-2 tested, 17,075 (12%) were positive and 124,979 (78%) were negative. The most common specimen collection sites (Table 1) and pathogens (Table 2) are shown. Higher rates of urine and respiratory cultures and higher rates of P. aeruginosa and fungi were seen in SARS CoV-2 positive patients. The top pathogens for urine cultures were Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, for blood Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli and respiratory Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. SARS-CoV-2 positive patients had an overall longer length of stay (LOS) than negative, which almost doubled when a positive pathogen was identified. [Image: see text] [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: There were similar rates of positive pathogen identification among SARS-CoV-2 test positive and negative patients, which might highlight similarities in clinical presentation. However, SARS-CoV-2 positive patients had longer hospital LOS and LOS increased with positive culture. Sources of infection and pathogens varied based on a positive or negative SARS-CoV-2 result. Identifying likely causative pathogens of co-infections in the era of SARS-CoV-2 is critical for treatment optimization. DISCLOSURES: Laura A.

Single-center retrospective study of 145 COVID-19 patients admitted to ICU. DVT was assessed with a CDUS performed by experienced radiologist after ICU admission. DVT was confirmed in 38 patients (26%). Most DVT were distal to the knee (66%), while only 16% were proximal. At the time of the examination, 55% of the patients received full-dose anticoagulation, while 45% received thromboprophylaxis, and there were no differences in anticoagulation regimen between positive and negative patients. Patients with DVT had higher dimers compared with those with negative CDUS (P < .002). The observed frequency of DVT is high despite adequate anticoagulation. A comprehensive and experienced ultrasound examination protocol can allow to recognize a large number of distal DVT otherwise missed, albeit their clinical significance is unknown.","Pozzi, Matteo; Giani, Marco; Fumagalli, Benedetta; Calabria, Mariangela; Leni, Davide; Segramora, Vittorio; Bellani, Giacomo; Foti, Giuseppe",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7803790/,175

Our aim in this article is to explore and discuss relational ethics, as ethics-in-action, in a long-term research relationship with a child. Our question is: How is ethics-in-action negotiated during critical incidents in the construction of a research space that involves a long-term research relationship with a young child? This article is based on a research project that focused on children’s transitions in early childhood education and care (ECEC). These transitions include the transition from home care to ECEC as well as transitions from child groups or settings to other ECEC groups or settings, and the transition to pre-primary education. We apply a particular lens to the corpus of data, analyzing and reflecting critical incidents vis-à-vis a negotiation of ethics-in-action during the construction of our research space, which involved a long-term research relationship with a child. Our results show that critical incidents in our study’s negotiation of ethics-in-action included (a) the focus child’s spontaneous contributions to the study’s interviews, (b) interdependencies between the child and diverse researchers, and (c) the child’s evolving expertise in data collection, which restructured our study’s research space. We conclude that ethical questions cannot be separated from the mutually constituted relationships or socio-spatial context in where they emerge; thus, they are relationally and spatially embedded.","Rutanen, Niina; Raittila, Raija; Harju, Kaisa; Revilla, Yaiza Lucas; Hännikäinen, Maritta",Hu Arenas,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8054847/,175

In this article, we explore prisoners’ lived experiences of the pandemic in English and Welsh prisons, captured through correspondence with prisoners throughout 12 months of regime restrictions, from April 2020 to April 2021.

I find that beliefs about conspiracy theories are more correlated than the values associated with established political ideologies, and that conspiracy beliefs and scepticism about the pandemic are best explained by belief in unrelated political and medical conspiracy theories. No other demographic or attitudinal variable has such a strong influence, and the results are robust to different statistical specifications. In comparison, the effect of ideology measured by left‐right self‐placement is rather negligible and further moderated by trust in government.

However, older patients who receive prolonged mechanical ventilation may have a significantly different long-term trajectory not fully captured in 30-day postoperative metrics. The objective of this study is to describe patterns of mortality and hospitalization for Medicare beneficiaries 66 years old and older who have major surgery with and without prolonged mechanical ventilation. DESIGN Retrospective cohort study. SETTING Hospitals throughout the United States. PATIENTS Five percent random national sample of elderly Medicare beneficiaries (age ≥ 66 yr) who underwent 1 of 227 operations previously defined as high risk during an inpatient stay at an acute care hospital between January 1, 2005, and November 30, 2009. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS We identified 117,917 episodes for older patients who had high-risk surgery; 4% received prolonged mechanical ventilation during the hospitalization. Patients who received prolonged mechanical ventilation had higher 1-year mortality rate than patients who did not have prolonged ventilation (64% [95% CI, 62-65%] vs 17% [95% CI, 16.4-16.9%]). Thirty-day survivors who received prolonged mechanical ventilation had a 1-year mortality rate of 47% (95% CI, 45-48%). Thirty-day survivors who did not receive prolonged ventilation were more likely to be discharged home than patients who received prolonged ventilation 71% versus 10%. Patients who received prolonged ventilation and were not discharged by postoperative day 30 had a substantially increased 1-year mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 4.39 [95% CI, 3.29-5.85]) compared with patients discharged home by day 30. Hospitalized 30-day survivors who received prolonged mechanical ventilation and died within 6 months of their index procedure spent the majority of their remaining days hospitalized. CONCLUSIONS Older patients who require prolonged mechanical ventilation after high-risk surgery and survive 30 days have a significant 1-year risk of mortality and high burdens of treatment. This difficult trajectory should be considered in surgical decision making and has important implications for surgeons, intensivists, and patients.","Nabozny, Michael J; Barnato, Amber E; Rathouz, Paul J; Havlena, Jeffrey A; Kind, Amy J; Ehlenbach, William J; Zhao, Qianqian; Ronk, Katie; Smith, Maureen A; Greenberg, Caprice C; Schwarze, Margaret L",Critical care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/ccm.0000000000001618; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26841105/,175

The colloid-induced agglutinative effects on RBCs and RBC retention after liver washout with Ringer's lactate (RL), histidine tryptophan ketoglutarate solution, University of Wisconsin solution, and Polysol were determined as a function of the washout pressure (15 or 100 mm Hg) and temperature (4 or 37°C) in a rat liver washout model with (99m) Tc-pertechnetate-labeled RBCs. Colloids (polyethylene glycol in Polysol and hydroxyethyl starch in University of Wisconsin) induced RBC agglutination, regardless of the solution's composition. RL was associated with the lowest degree of (99m) Tc-pertechnetate-labeled RBC retention after simultaneous arterial and portal washout at 37°C and 100 mm Hg. RL washout was also associated with the shortest washout time. A single portal washout with any of the solutions did not result in differences in the degree of RBC retention, regardless of the temperature or pressure. In conclusion, no differences were found in portal washout efficacy between colloidal solutions, histidine tryptophan ketoglutarate, and RL. Simultaneous arterial and portal washout with RL at 37°C and 100 mm Hg resulted in the least RBC retention and the shortest washout time.","Post, Ivo C J H; Dirkes, Marcel C; Heger, Michal; Verheij, Joanne; de Bruin, Kora M; de Korte, Dirk; Bennink, Roelof J; van Gulik, Thomas M",Liver transplantation : official publication of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the International Liver Transplantation Society,https://doi.org/10.1002/lt.23670; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23696414/,175

The depletion of endogenous Zinc ions (Zn) caused by the administration of gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) has been suggested as a possible pathomechanism for nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF). MATERIALS AND METHODS In the Zn supplementation study, rats were injected with Gadodiamide, Omniscan, and Magnevist with or without Zn supplementation. In the Zn depletion study, animals were kept on a Zn-deficient diet or a special control diet and received injections of Omniscan, OptiMARK, Magnevist, Gadovist, and Gd-EDTA. Gd, Zn, and Cu concentrations in tissue were measured and histology of the skin was performed. RESULTS As seen in earlier studies, a difference in Gd concentration in the skin was observed following treatment with the different GBCAs. High Gd concentration in the skin correlated with the occurrence of NSF-like skin lesions. We observed no differences in the occurrence of skin lesions between the Zn supplementation and the Zn-deficient groups compared to their respective control groups. CONCLUSION We found no significant effect of Zn on the initiation of NSF-like skin lesions. The results further support data from previous studies highlighting the importance of complex stability of the investigated GBCAs.","Pietsch, Hubertus; Pering, Christiane; Lengsfeld, Philipp; Walter, Jakob; Steger-Hartmann, Thomas; Golfier, Sven; Frenzel, Thomas; Hütter, Joachim; Weinmann, Hans-Joachim; Sieber, Martin A",Journal of magnetic resonance imaging : JMRI,https://doi.org/10.1002/jmri.21845; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19629978/,175

METHODS Thirty-four women scheduled for elective CD under spinal anesthesia were recruited. In the operating room rSO2 of the left and right frontal area and right thigh was recorded using three disposable sensors. A combination of 1.8-2.0 ml of 0.75% ropivacaine plus 10 μg of fentanyl were injected intrathecally. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, SpO2 as well as rSO2 of the left and right forehead areas and right thigh were recorded before, 5, 10, and 25 to 50 minutes after spinal injection, after uterine incision and placenta delivery, and analyzed with ANOVA repeated measures. The study was approved by the Aretaieio Hospital Institutional Review Board and registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (ID: NCT01669135). RESULTS The rSO2 left and right frontal area values decreased significantly from baseline (p=0.0001 and p=0.0001 respectively), with most remarkable decreases 5 and 10 minutes after spinal injection, from 65 (SD 8.7)% to 56 (SD 9.3)% and 56 (SD 9.5)% (p=0.0001 and p=0.0001) for the left and from 63 (SD 7.7)% to 55 (SD 9.3)% and 56 (SD 8.9)% (p=0,0001 and p=0.0001) for the right frontal area respectively. The rSO2 right thigh values increased significantly during the study period (p=0.0001). KEY LIMITATIONS Contribution of extracranial circulation to the rSO2, lack of PaCO2 and cardiac output measurements. CONCLUSIONS Women undergoing CD under spinal anesthesia may present decreases in cerebral rSO2.

62357,Busulfan Suppresses Autophagy in Mouse Spermatogonial Progenitor Cells via mTOR of AKT and p53 Signaling Pathways.,2020-08-24,"UNLABELLED Affibody molecules are a recently developed class of targeting proteins based on a nonimmunoglobulin scaffold. The small size (7 kDa) and subnanomolar affinity of Affibody molecules enables high-contrast imaging of tumor-associated molecular targets, particularly human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2). (99m)Tc as a label offers advantages in clinical practice, and earlier studies demonstrated that (99m)Tc-labeled recombinant Affibody molecules with a C-terminal cysteine could be used for HER2 imaging. However, the renal retention of radioactivity exceeded tumor uptake, which might complicate imaging of metastases in the lumbar region. The aim of this study was to develop an agent with low renal uptake and preserved tumor targeting. METHODS A series of recombinant derivatives of the HER2-binding Z(HER2)(:342) Affibody molecule with a C-terminal chelating sequence, -GXXC (X denoting glycine, serine, lysine, or glutamate), was designed. The constructs were labeled with (99m)Tc and evaluated in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS All variants were stably labeled with (99m)Tc, with preserved capacity to bind specifically to HER2-expressing cells in vitro and in vivo. The composition of the chelating sequence had a clear influence on the cellular processing and biodistribution properties of the Affibody molecules. The best variant, (99m)Tc-Z(HER2)(:V2), with the C-terminal chelating sequence -GGGC, provided the lowest radioactivity retention in all normal organs and tissues including the kidneys. (99m)Tc-Z(HER2)(:V2) displayed high uptake of radioactivity in HER2-expressing xenografts, 22.6 ± 4.0 and 7.7 ± 1.5 percentage injected activity per gram of tissue at 4 h after injection in SKOV-3 (high HER2 expression) and DU-145 (low HER2 expression) tumors, respectively. In both models, the tumor uptake exceeded the renal uptake. CONCLUSION These results demonstrate that the biodistribution properties of recombinant (99m)Tc-labeled Affibody molecules can be optimized by modification of the C-terminal cysteine-containing chelating sequence. (99m)Tc-Z(HER2)(:V2) is a promising candidate for further development as a diagnostic radiopharmaceutical for imaging of HER2-expressing tumors. These results may be useful for the development of imaging agents based on other Affibody molecules and, hopefully, other scaffolds.","Wållberg, Helena; Orlova, Anna; Altai, Mohammed; Hosseinimehr, Seyed Jalal; Widström, Charles; Malmberg, Jennie; Ståhl, Stefan; Tolmachev, Vladimir","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",https://doi.org/10.2967/jnumed.110.083592; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21321280/,175

62875,"Standardized transportation of human islets: an islet cell resource center study of more than 2,000 shipments.",2013,"BACKGROUND Impairments in squat depth have been reported in patients with femoroacetabular impingement syndrome (FAIS). However, little is known about single-leg squat (SLS) performance in these patients, despite this task being commonly used in the rehabilitation and training settings. PURPOSE/HYPOTHESIS The aims of this study were (1) to investigate whether patients with FAIS demonstrate differences in SLS performance compared with healthy controls and (2) to determine whether dynamic range of motion (ROM), muscle strength, hip morphologic measures, hip pain, and hip-specific function predict SLS performance in patients with FAIS. We hypothesized that patients with FAIS would demonstrate impaired SLS performance and that impaired hip biomechanics, muscle strength, and hip-specific function would predict squat performance in patients with FAIS. STUDY DESIGN Controlled laboratory study. METHODS Three-dimensional (3D) kinematic data were collected at 100 Hz using a 20-camera 3D motion capture system during 3 SLS trials in 34 patients with FAIS and 26 healthy controls. Isometric muscle strength was tested with a stationary handheld dynamometer in all participants. Squat performance was quantified by squat depth (in meters), and the biomechanical variables of dynamic ROM of the pelvis, the hip, the knee, and the ankle in all planes were calculated. In patients with FAIS, femoral and acetabular morphology were measured using radiographic alpha angles and lateral center-edge angles. Hip pain and hip-specific function were measured using the visual analog scale for pain and the Hip Outcome Score Activities of Daily Living subscale, respectively. Two-tailed independent-samples t tests were used to determine between-group differences for squat depth, dynamic ROM variables, and muscle strength. A hierarchical multiple linear regression (MLR) model was used to determine whether biomechanical variables, muscle strength, hip morphology measures, hip pain, and hip-specific function were predictors of squat depth. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS Version 26. RESULTS There were no between-group differences in age (FAIS, 30.0 ± 7.0 years vs controls, 27.3 ± 7.0 years; P = .18) or body mass index (FAIS, 23.1 ± 2.8 vs controls, 22.6 ± 3.2; P = .51). Squat depth was less in patients with FAIS compared with healthy controls (FAIS, 0.24 ± 0.4 m vs controls, 0.29 ± 0.05 m; P < .001). In the sagittal plane, patients with FAIS demonstrated less dynamic ROM of the hip (FAIS, 67.8°± 12.4° vs controls, 79.2°± 12.5°; P = .001) and the knee (FAIS, 71.9°± 9.4° vs controls, 78.9°± 13.2°; P = .02) compared with controls. Patients with FAIS also demonstrated a less dynamic coronal plane pelvis ROM (FAIS, 11.3°± 5.0° vs controls, 14.4°± 6.7°; P = .044). Patients with FAIS had reduced hip muscle strength of the hip external rotator (FAIS, 1 ± 0.3 N/kg vs controls, 1.2 ± 0.3 N/kg; P = .034), hip internal rotator (FAIS, 0.8 ± 0.3 N/kg vs controls 1 ± 0.3 N/kg; P = .03), and hip flexor (FAIS, 4 ± 1.1 N/kg vs controls, 4.8 ± 1.2 N/kg; P = .013) muscle groups. The hierarchical MLR revealed that the dynamic ROM of the hip, the knee, and the pelvis, the hip external rotation muscle strength, and the femoral alpha angles were all significant predictors of squat performance, and the final MLR model explained 92.4% of the total variance in squat depth in patients with FAIS. CONCLUSION Patients with FAIS demonstrate impaired SLS squat performance compared with healthy controls. This impaired squat performance is predominantly predicted by sagittal plane knee and hip biomechanics and hip external rotator strength, and less by frontal plane pelvic ROM and hip morphology in patients with FAIS. CLINICAL RELEVANCE Clinicians should focus treatment on improving dynamic ROM and hip external rotator muscle strength to improve squat performance; however, femoral morphology should also be considered in the treatment paradigm.","Malloy, Philip; Wichman, Daniel M; Garcia, Flavio; Espinoza-Orías, Alejandro; Chahla, Jorge; Nho, Shane J",The American journal of sports medicine,https://doi.org/10.1177/03635465211029032; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34339327/,175
63473,"Chikungunya outbreak, French Polynesia, 2014.",2015,"OBJECTIVES This paper outlines how oral diseases such as periodontitis and periapical periodontitis may be linked to cardiovascular disease, atrial fibrillation and cardiac arrhythmia. We undertake a systematic review of the literature focused on acute dental infection and types of cardiac arrhythmia and also describe an illustrative case where an acute dental infection diagnosed as periapical periodontitis was associated with occurrence of atrial fibrillation. METHODS An electronic search was undertaken using MEDLINE and SCOPUS from 01 Jan 1970 until 30 June 2020. We also undertook manual searches using forward and backward citation chasing. Inclusion criteria were any primary research studies investigating any acute dental infection, with outcomes of cardiac arrhythmia or atrial fibrillation. RESULTS Over the last fifty years, only two low quality studies have been investigated this area. Our illustrative case involved a 58-year-old who was diagnosed with an acute dental infection from an upper canine tooth who then developed atrial fibrillation. CONCLUSIONS Based on the biological plausibility of a link between acute dental infection and types of cardiac arrhythmia such as atrial fibrillation, together with the case report presented, it is evident that further study in this area is needed. If there are possible cardiovascular consequences for patients suffering with acute dental infection, then this has implications for healthcare staff since they can integrate professional advice related to oral health with cardiovascular disease and atrial fibrillation. Screening programmes situated in dental settings can facilitate early intervention and prevention producing benefits for patients and savings to the health system.","Hassan, Amaar; Lip, Gregory Y H; Harris, Rebecca V",International journal of clinical practice,https://doi.org/10.1111/ijcp.13875; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33253465/,175

Little information is available from Southern African countries which have similar climatic and occupational characteristics to CKDu-endemic countries. We investigated whether CKDu is prevalent in Malawi and identified its potential risk factors in this setting. METHODS We conducted a cross-sectional study from January-August 2018 collecting bio samples and anthropometric data in two Malawian populations. The sample comprised adults > 18 years (n = 821) without diabetes, hypertension, and proteinuria. Estimates of glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were calculated using the CKD-EPI equation. Linear and logistic regression models were applied with potential risk factors, to estimate risk of reduced eGFR. RESULTS The mean eGFR was 117.1 ± 16.0 ml/min per 1.73m2 and the mean participant age was 33.5 ± 12.7 years. The prevalence of eGFR< 60 was 0.2% (95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.1, 0.9); the prevalence of eGFR< 90 was 5% (95% CI =3.2, 6.3). We observed a higher prevalence in the rural population (5% (3.6, 7.8)), versus urban (3% (1.4, 6.7)). Age and BMI were associated with reduced eGFR< 90 [Odds ratio (OR) (95%CI) =3.59 (2.58, 5.21) per ten-year increment]; [OR (95%CI) =2.01 (1.27, 3.43) per 5 kg/m2 increment] respectively. No increased risk of eGFR < 90 was observed for rural participants [OR (95%CI) =1.75 (0.50, 6.30)]. CONCLUSIONS Reduced kidney function consistent with the definition of CKDu is not common in the areas of Malawi sampled, compared to that observed in other tropical or sub-tropical countries in Central America and South Asia.

We performed first-in-human PET imaging of mAChR with 18F-Fluorobenzyl-Dexetimide (FDEX) in 10 healthy participants (29.4±4.3yrs). Four underwent dynamic brain scanning for 240 min, and then six underwent static brain scans at 120 and 160-min post injection of 250 MBq of FDEX. Gjedde-Patlak graphical analysis was applied to determine the influx constant (Ki). Regional tissue ratios (SUVR) were calculated using the cerebellar cortex as the reference region. No adverse events were observed. The tracer showed good brain entry (∼4.2% ID at 5 min) but irreversible distribution kinetics over four hours in regions of high mAChR. Binding was consistent with the distribution of mAChR receptors with striatum > cortex > hippocampus >> thalamus >>> cerebellum with low variance in regional binding between subjects. Ki was 0.42±0.04 in the putamen, 0.27±0.01 in frontal cortex, 0.25±0.02 in the hippocampus and 0.10±0.01 in the thalamus. SUVR at 120 and 240 min. were highly correlated with these Ki values with R2 of 0.91 and 0.99 respectively. FDEX yields high quality brain images with uptake in the known distribution of mAChR with remarkably little variance between normal subjects.","Rowe, Christopher C; Krishnadas, Natasha; Ackermann, Uwe; Doré, Vincent; Goh, Rachel Y W; Guzman, Rodney; Chong, Lee; Bozinovski, Svetlana; Mulligan, Rachel; Kanaan, Richard; Dean, Brian; Villemagne, Victor L",Psychiatry research.

65564,Generation of a protective T-cell response following coronavirus infection of the central nervous system is not dependent on IL-12/23 signaling.,2008,"The objective of this study was to present the initial operative experience of solo surgeon single-port laparoscopic surgery (SPLS) in the laparoscopic treatment of benign gynecologic diseases and to investigate its feasibility and surgical outcomes. Using a novel homemade laparoscope-anchored instrument system that consisted of a laparoscopic instrument attached to a laparoscope and a glove-wound retractor umbilical port, we performed solo surgeon SPLS in 13 patients between March 2011 and June 2012. Intraoperative complications and postoperative surgical outcomes were determined. The primary operative procedures performed were unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (n = 5), unilateral salpingectomy (n = 2), adhesiolysis (n = 1), and laparoscopically assisted vaginal hysterectomy (n = 5). Additional surgical procedures included additional adhesiolysis (n = 4) and ovarian drilling (n = 1).The primary indications for surgery were benign ovarian tumors (n = 5), ectopic pregnancy (n = 2), pelvic adhesion (infertility) (n = 1), and benign uterine tumors (n = 5). Solo surgeon SPLS was successfully accomplished in all procedures without a laparoscopic assistant. There were no intraoperative or postoperative complications. Our laparoscope-anchored instrument system obviates the need for an additional laparoscopic assistant and enables SPLS to be performed by a solo surgeon. The findings show that with our system, solo surgeon SPLS is a feasible and safe alternative technique for the treatment of benign gynecologic diseases in properly selected patients.","Yang, Yun Seok; Kim, Seung Hyun; Jin, Chan Hee; Oh, Kwoan Young; Hur, Myung Haeng; Kim, Soo Young; Yim, Hyun Soon",Journal of minimally invasive gynecology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmig.2014.02.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24509292/,175

METHODS AND POPULATION We used in-house TaqMan multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction to test nasopharyngeal samples from 536 RTI episodes in 452 children who were admitted during the 2006-2007 winter. Twenty-one viruses, including HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, HCoV-HKU1, and RSV were tested. The amount of viral nucleic acid was recorded semiquantitatively based on the cycle threshold value. RESULTS A total of 665 positive polymerase chain reaction tests were recorded in 536 nasopharyngeal specimens. Coronavirus was found in 68 (12.7%): HCoV-OC43, n = 44 (8.2%), and HCoV-NL63, n = 24 (4.5%). Only RSV and rhinovirus were detected more frequently. Neither HCoV-229E nor HCoV-HKU1 was detected. Among children with HCoV-OC43, 73.0% tested positive for at least one other virus, compared with 41.2% with HCoV-NL63 and 40.3% with RSV (P = 0.03 and P < 0.01, respectively). Children with HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-NL63 were older than children with RSV (median age, 19 vs. 10 months, P = 0.01). Lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) was half as common in children with HCoV-OC43 (48.6%) and HCoV-NL63 (47.1%) as in children with RSV (82.3%) (both P < 0.01). After adjusting for age, chronic disease, LRTI, and co-detection of other viruses in a multiple logistic regression analysis, HCoV was associated with a shorter fever period and shorter hospitalization time than RSV. CONCLUSIONS HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-NL63 are common among hospitalized Norwegian children with RTI. Children with HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-NL63 have LRTI less frequently and may need a shorter hospital stay than children with RSV.","Kristoffersen, Aslak Widerøe; Nordbø, Svein Arne; Rognlien, Anne-Gro Wesenberg; Christensen, Andreas; Døllner, Henrik",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,https://doi.org/10.1097/inf.0b013e3181fcb159; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21057374/,175
65829,High cytokine levels in perforated acute otitis media exudates containing live bacteria.,2010,"BACKGROUND Tenofovir-based antiretroviral therapy (ART) has become first-line in all major HIV treatment guidelines. Compared with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) has a favorable renal and bone safety profile, but concerns about metabolic complications remain. OBJECTIVE To assess weight changes, the development of overweight/obesity, and changes in lipid levels 18 months after replacing TDF with TAF. DESIGN Cohort study. SETTING 5 university hospitals, affiliated hospitals, and private physicians in Switzerland. PARTICIPANTS 4375 adults living with HIV who received TDF-containing ART for 6 months or longer. MEASUREMENTS Changes in weight and lipid levels were assessed using mixed-effect models. Differences in proportions of newly overweight/obese participants were calculated using 2-proportions Z tests. RESULTS 4375 individuals were included, with follow-up between 1 January 2016 and 31 July 2019. Median age was 50 years (interquartile range, 43 to 56 years), 25.9% were female, and 51.7% had a normal body mass index (BMI); 3484 (79.6%) switched to TAF and 891 (20.4%) continued TDF. After 18 months, switching to TAF was associated with an adjusted mean weight increase of 1.7 kg (95% CI, 1.5 to 2.0 kg), compared with 0.7 kg (CI, 0.4 to 1.0 kg) with the continued use of TDF (between-group difference, 1.1 kg [CI, 0.7 to 1.4 kg]). Among individuals with a normal BMI, 13.8% who switched to TAF became overweight/obese, compared with 8.4% of those continuing TDF (difference, 5.4 percentage points [CI, 2.1 to 8.8 percentage points]). Switching to TAF led to increases in adjusted mean total cholesterol (0.25 mmol/L [9.5 mg/dL]), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (0.05 mmol/L [1.9 mg/dL]), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (0.12 mmol/L [4.7 mg/dL]), and triglyceride (0.18 mmol/L [16.1 mg/dL]) levels after 18 months. LIMITATION Short follow-up, small subgroup analyses, and potential residual confounding. CONCLUSION Replacing TDF with TAF is associated with adverse metabolic changes, including weight increase, development of obesity, and worsening serum lipid levels.

It controls several cancer-associated cellular events, including cancer cell proliferation, stemness, survival, metastasis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), therapy resistance, and inhibition of programmed cell death to support cancer growth and recurrence. This multifunctional role of CLU makes it an ideal target for cancer control. More importantly, genetic and antisense mediated inhibition (OGX-011) of CLU enhances the anticancer potential of different FDA-approved chemotherapeutic drugs at the clinical level, improving patient's survival. In this review, we have discussed the detailed mechanism of CLU-mediated modulation of different cancer-associated signaling pathways.

The soil was mixed with green waste compost and spiked with naphthalene which concentration varied from 0 to 500 ppm. Obtained results indicate that naphthalene additive at the concentration rate from 100 to 500 ppm reduced spring barley germination. The significant lower weight of green mass per pot, one plant weight and mass of 1000 grains were observed in the amendment with the highest naphthalene concentration (500 ppm). It was determined the daily intake (ED) of 16PAHs via spring barley grain and incremental lifetime cancer risks (ILCR). Estimated ED and ILCR of 16PAHs via spring barley ranged from 1.00 to 3.78 ng day-1 and 3.79 to 14.3 × 10-5 respectively. It should be noted that obtained results are higher around 10 times compared to previous studies performed using wheat grain. This study presents the mechanisms of naphthalene bioaccumulation and effect on the mineral composition of the most common agricultural plant spring barley grain and straw. Spring barley grain was found to have a higher content of nitrogen (N), boron (B) and phosphorous (P), whereas straw had a higher content of potassium (K), sodium (Na), chromium (Cr) and calcium (Ca).","Barčauskaitė, Karolina; Mažeika, Romas",Environmental science and pollution research international,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-12074-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33411288/,175

67127,Acute chikungunya virus infection and asthma.,2010,"INTRODUCTION Rapid development and production of vaccines against emerging diseases requires well established, validated, robust technologies to allow industrial scale production and accelerated licensure of products. Areas covered: A versatile Vero cell platform has been developed and utilized to deliver a wide range of candidate and licensed vaccines against emerging viral diseases. This platform builds on the 35 years' experience and safety record with inactivated whole virus vaccines such as polio vaccine. The current platform has been optimized to include a novel double inactivation procedure in order to ensure a highly robust inactivation procedure for novel emerging viruses. The utility of this platform in rapidly developing inactivated whole virus vaccines against pandemic (-like) influenza viruses and other emerging viruses such as West Nile, Chikungunya, Ross River and SARS is reviewed. The potential of the platform for development of vaccines against other emerging viruses such as Zika virus is described. Expert commentary: Use of this platform can substantially accelerate process development and facilitate licensure because of the substantial existing data set available for the cell matrix. However, programs to provide vaccines against emerging diseases must allow alternative clinical development paths to licensure, without the requirement to carry out large scale field efficacy studies.","Barrett, P Noel; Terpening, Sara J; Snow, Doris; Cobb, Ronald R; Kistner, Otfried",Expert review of vaccines,https://doi.org/10.1080/14760584.2017.1357471; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28724343/,175

The ""Fistula zero"" project aims to reduce the number of PCF by following a detailed protocol based on three fundamental key points. Materials and Methods The Fistula zero project included 77 patients who underwent total laryngectomy in the period from January 2019 to December 2020. The protocol consisted of three main aspects: the systematic placement of a Har-El salivary bypass tube, the continuous horizontal watertight pharyngeal suture using a barbed suture, onlay insetting of a pedicled flap in pre-treated patients. Results One case of PCF (1.3%) and three small blind fistulas (3.9%) were observed in this series. The mean length of hospitalization was 18 days. Conclusion Pharyngocutaneous fistula (PCF) prolongs hospitalization and delays adjuvant treatments. Thanks to a strict adherence to the protocol, it was possible to reduce PCF rates, avoiding lengthy hospitalization and additional surgical procedures.","Crosetti, Erika; Arrigoni, Giulia; Sprio, Andrea Elio; Succo, Giovanni",Frontiers in oncology,https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2021.690703; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34239804/,175

Here we compare the outcomes in paired cohorts between patients undergoing open hepatic resection (OHR) and LAHR. STUDY DESIGN Two hundred and twelve patients who underwent either OHR or LAHR from March 2004 to July 2011 were analyzed to assess outcomes. During this time period, 124 patients underwent OHR and 88 underwent LAHR. Demographic and outcomes data were assessed. RESULTS In the total patient cohort, mean age found in both surgical arms was similar, as was the mean BMI. In addition, there was no difference in the cohort between those who underwent either minor or major hepatic resections (p = 0.52). Operatively, in the OHR arm the mean duration of the operation was 234 minutes and comparable with LAHR at 238 minutes (p = 0.75). There was also no difference in the mean lesion size in the OHR (5.72 cm) and LAHR (5.37 cm) groups (p = 0.55). Notably, there was no difference in the complication incidence rates, which were 10.5% (OHR) and 6.8% (LAHR) (p = 0.59). However, when analyzing for length of stay, there was a significant difference between the 2 arms; patients in OHR arm had longer stays than those in the LAHR arm (7.59 days vs 6.30 days, respectively; mean difference 1.29 days; 95% CI, 0.08-2.5; p = 0.036). CONCLUSIONS Although reduced surgical pain, improved cosmesis, and shortened hospital stays have been shown to correlate with laparoscopic abdominal procedures, our study indicates these marked advantages are also conferred to those undergoing LAHR. In addition, these findings demonstrate the use of LAHR and highlight the need for the addition of this technique to the liver surgeon's skill set.","Johnson, Lynt B; Graham, Jay A; Weiner, David A; Smirniotopoulos, John",Journal of the American College of Surgeons,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2011.12.044; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22463915/,175

This retrospective study is based on a single-center cohort including 657 fresh cycles with day 3 embryo transfer using the GnRHa long protocol and the GnRHant flexible protocol at the fertility clinic of a university hospital between 2005 and 2019. The rate ratios (RR) of clinical pregnancy were evaluated using log-binomial regression depending on the categories by the number of retrieved oocytes and pituitary suppression methods. After controlling for age, body mass index, and basal follicle-stimulating hormone, women with 10-11 oocytes retrieved demonstrated a significantly higher chance of clinical pregnancy compared to the reference group (4-5 oocytes) (RR 1.68, 95% CI 1.12-2.53). However, retrieval of more than 11 oocytes did not show a significant difference in pregnancy rates (PR) from the reference group. In women treated with GnRHant, a significantly higher clinical PR was also observed in women with 10-11 oocytes retrieved compared to the reference group (RR 1.90, 95% CI 1.05-3.42). In women treated with GnRHa long protocol, a higher probability of clinical pregnancy was observed (RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.98-1.73) in the group with 8-11 oocytes retrieved and it demonstrated borderline statistical significance (P = 0.07). In summary, the optimal number of oocytes for maximizing the rate of a clinical pregnancy is different according to the method of pituitary suppression. Too many oocytes do not seem to be beneficial for achieving better clinical outcomes.","Kim, Hoon; Han, Soo Jin; Hong, Yun Soo; Kim, Sung Woo; Ku, Seung-Yup; Suh, Chang Suk; Kim, Seok Hyun",Reproductive sciences,https://doi.org/10.1007/s43032-021-00550-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33763817/,175

In this study, archived samples from pet and kenneled dogs in the United Kingdom were screened for CnPnV to explore the relationship between exposure to CnPnV and the development of canine infectious respiratory disease (CIRD). Within the pet dog population, CnPnV-seropositive dogs were detected throughout the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland, with an overall estimated seroprevalence of 50% (n = 314/625 dogs). In the kennel population, there was a significant increase in seroprevalence, from 26% (n = 56/215 dogs) on the day of entry to 93.5% (n = 201/215 dogs) after 21 days (P <0001). Dogs that were seronegative on entry but seroconverted while in the kennel were 4 times more likely to develop severe respiratory disease than those that did not seroconvert (P < 0.001), and dogs with preexisting antibodies to CnPnV on the day of entry were significantly less likely to develop respiratory disease than immunologically naive dogs (P < 0.001). CnPnV was detected in the tracheal tissues of 29/205 kenneled dogs. Detection was most frequent in dogs with mild to moderate respiratory signs and histopathological changes and in dogs housed for 8 to 14 days, which coincided with a significant increase in the risk of developing respiratory disease compared to the risk of those housed 1 to 7 days (P < 0.001). These findings demonstrate that CnPnV is present in the United Kingdom dog population; there is a strong association between exposure to CnPnV and CIRD in the kennel studied and a potential benefit in vaccinating against CnPnV as part of a wider disease prevention strategy.","Mitchell, Judy A; Cardwell, Jacqueline M; Renshaw, Randall W; Dubovi, Edward J; Brownlie, Joe",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm.02312-13; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24088858/,175

Optimal surgical treatment, including its timing, remains a controversial topic. The present study reports the case of a 67-year-old female patient with adrenal and pancreatic manifestations of VHL. A laparoscopic cortex-sparing left adrenalectomy for a 4-cm pheochromocytoma and pancreatic enucleation for pancreatic polypeptidoma of the pancreas tail were performed during the same operative procedure. The total operative time was 240 min. There were no operative complications, and the surgery was completed laparoscopically with minimal blood loss. A prolonged hospital stay was necessary to treat a grade C postoperative pancreatic fistula. The histopathological result was an adrenal pheochromocytoma and a well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor, secreting pancreatic polypeptides.

Resources were shifted to COVID-19 patients, screening programs were temporary suspended, and oncological care suffered slow-down. The aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of these measures on breast cancer patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS All breast cancer patients referred to our unit from February 21, 2019 to February 21, 2021 were enrolled. Type of treatments and surgery, TNM, tumor diameter, and predictive and prognostic factors were analyzed. RESULTS Out of 445 patients with a breast cancer diagnosis, 182 (40.9%) were enrolled in the COVID-19 group (from February 21, 2010 to February 21, 2021). These patients were compared with 263 (59.1%) patients pre-COVID-19. Tumor diameters were bigger in the COVID-19 group. Type of surgery and N staging were statistically significantly different. Extreme advanced disease incidence was significantly different between the groups (2.7% COVID-19 group vs. 0 pre-COVID-19 group, p=0.011). Incidence of post-surgical radiation-therapy was higher in the COVID-19 group. Other variables analyzed were comparable without a statistically significant difference. CONCLUSION COVID-19 led to increased tumor dimensions, advanced N-staging, and increased need for adjuvant treatments in breast cancer.","Vanni, Gianluca; Pellicciaro, Marco; Materazzo, Marco; Pedini, Domiziana; Portarena, Ilaria; Buonomo, Chiara; Perretta, Tommaso; Rizza, Stefano; Pistolese, Chiara Adriana; Buonomo, Oreste Claudio",Anticancer research,https://doi.org/10.21873/anticanres.15050; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33952500/,175

70865,Endothelin-1 downregulates angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 expression in human bronchial epithelial cells.,2013,"BACKGROUND The common cold is an upper respiratory tract infection, most commonly caused by a rhinovirus. It affects people of all age groups and although in most cases it is self limiting, the common cold still causes significant morbidity. Antihistamines are commonly offered over the counter to relieve symptoms for patients affected by the common cold, however there is not much evidence of their efficacy. OBJECTIVES To assess the effects of antihistamines on the common cold. SEARCH METHODS We searched CENTRAL (2015, Issue 6), MEDLINE (1948 to July week 4, 2015), EMBASE (2010 to August 2015), CINAHL (1981 to August 2015), LILACS (1982 to August 2015) and Biosis Previews (1985 to August 2015). SELECTION CRITERIA We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) using antihistamines as monotherapy for the common cold. We excluded any studies with combination therapy or using antihistamines in patients with an allergic component in their illness. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We collected adverse effects information from the included trials. MAIN RESULTS We included 18 RCTs, which were reported in 17 publications (one publication reports on two trials) with 4342 participants (of which 212 were children) suffering from the common cold, both naturally occurring and experimentally induced. The interventions consisted of an antihistamine as monotherapy compared with placebo. In adults there was a short-term beneficial effect of antihistamines on severity of overall symptoms: on day one or two of treatment 45% had a beneficial effect with antihistamines versus 38% with placebo (odds ratio (OR) 0.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.60 to 0.92). However, there was no difference between antihistamines and placebo in the mid term (three to four days) to long term (six to 10 days). When evaluating individual symptoms such as nasal congestion, rhinorrhoea and sneezing, there was some beneficial effect of the sedating antihistamines compared to placebo (e.g. rhinorrhoea on day three: mean difference (MD) -0.23, 95% CI -0.39 to -0.06 on a four- or five-point severity scale; sneezing on day three: MD -0.35, 95% CI -0.49 to -0.20 on a four-point severity scale), but this effect is clinically non-significant. Adverse events such as sedation were more commonly reported with sedating antihistamines although the differences were not statistically significant. Only two trials included children and the results were conflicting. The majority of the trials had a low risk of bias although some lacked sufficient trial quality information. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Antihistamines have a limited short-term (days one and two of treatment) beneficial effect on severity of overall symptoms but not in the mid to long term. There is no clinically significant effect on nasal obstruction, rhinorrhoea or sneezing. Although side effects are more common with sedating antihistamines, the difference is not statistically significant. There is no evidence of effectiveness of antihistamines in children.","De Sutter, An I M; Saraswat, Avadhesh; van Driel, Mieke L",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd009345.pub2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26615034/,175

National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine entitled ""Emerging Infections, Microbial Threats to Health in the United States"" was released. This classic study captured the societal changes then underway in our rapidly growing world: The growth of the world's population and changing human behavior; the advances and globalization of technology and industry; the changes in economic development and land use; the dramatic increase in speed and frequency of international travel and commerce; the adaptation of microbes and the appearance of never before seen pathogens; and the breakdown of traditional public health measures. This societal evolution has only increased and the growing frequency of outbreaks foretold in the report has come to pass. Each new disaster has precipitated changes and adaptations in our global response to infectious diseases designed to reduce risks and avoid future outbreaks. We discuss these past events and how each led to change in an effort to mitigate future threats. We also look to the future to consider what challenges might lay ahead. CONCLUSION Major outbreaks over the past quarter century validated the concept of emerging infectious diseases and led to improvements in global policies and national public health programs; however, there will likely always be new diseases and the threat of reemergence of diseases once thought controlled leading to a constant need for vigilance in public health preparedness.","Le Duc, James W; Sorvillo, Teresa E",Acta medica academica,https://doi.org/10.5644/ama2006-124.222; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29957979/,175

Health service leaders in areas where COVID-19 is, or will soon be, in the ascendancy, and who are anticipating the imminent influx of PIMS-TS, should use these principles and recommendations to plan an agile, responsive and system-wide model of care for these children.","Cheung, C Ronny; Finnemore, Anna; Handforth, Jennifer; Bohmer, Richard; Christiansen, Nanna; Miller, Owen",Archives of disease in childhood,https://doi.org/10.1136/archdischild-2020-320358; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33115714/,175
71671,"Antibody-dependent enhancement of bacterial disease: Prevalence, mechanisms and treatment.",2021-02-08,"Carbon dioxide (CO2) movement across cellular membranes is passive and governed by Fick's law of diffusion. Until recently, we believed that gases cross biological membranes exclusively by dissolving in and then diffusing through membrane lipid. However, the observation that some membranes are CO2 impermeable led to the discovery of a gas molecule moving through a channel; namely, CO2 diffusion through aquaporin-1 (AQP1). Later work demonstrated CO2 diffusion through rhesus (Rh) proteins and NH3 diffusion through both AQPs and Rh proteins. The tetrameric AQPs exhibit differential selectivity for CO2 versus NH3 versus H2O, reflecting physico-chemical differences among the small molecules as well as among the hydrophilic monomeric pores and hydrophobic central pores of various AQPs. Preliminary work suggests that NH3 moves through the monomeric pores of AQP1, whereas CO2 moves through both monomeric and central pores. Initial work on AQP5 indicates that it is possible to create a metal-binding site on the central pore's extracellular face, thereby blocking CO2 movement. The trimeric Rh proteins have monomers with hydrophilic pores surrounding a hydrophobic central pore. Preliminary work on the bacterial Rh homologue AmtB suggests that gas can diffuse through the central pore and three sets of interfacial clefts between monomers. Finally, initial work indicates that CO2 diffuses through the electrogenic Na/HCO3 cotransporter NBCe1. At least in some cells, CO2-permeable proteins could provide important pathways for transmembrane CO2 movements. Such pathways could be amenable to cellular regulation and could become valuable drug targets.","Michenkova, Marie; Taki, Sara; Blosser, Matthew C; Hwang, Hyea J; Kowatz, Thomas; Moss, Fraser J; Occhipinti, Rossana; Qin, Xue; Sen, Soumyo; Shinn, Eric; Wang, Dengke; Zeise, Brian S; Zhao, Pan; Malmstadt, Noah; Vahedi-Faridi, Ardeschir; Tajkhorshid, Emad; Boron, Walter F",Interface focus,https://doi.org/10.1098/rsfs.2020.0090; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33633837/,175

To evaluate dysmenorrhea interventions, validated outcome measures are needed. In this two-phase study, we developed and tested the dysmenorrhea symptom interference scale. During the scale-development phase (n = 30), we created a nine-item scale based on qualitative data from cognitive interviews. During the scale-testing phase (n = 686), we evaluated reliability, validity, and responsiveness to change. The scale measures how dysmenorrhea symptoms interfere with physical, mental, and social activities. Internal consistency was strong with Cronbach's α > 0.9. Test-retest reliability was acceptable (r = 0.8). The scale showed satisfactory content validity, construct validity (supported by confirmatory factor analysis), concurrent validity, and responsiveness to change. The minimally important difference was 0.3 points on a scale with a possible total score ranging from 1 to 5. This new psychometrically sound scale can be used in research and clinical practice to facilitate the measurement and management of dysmenorrhea.","Chen, Chen X; Murphy, Tabitha; Ofner, Susan; Yahng, Lilian; Krombach, Peter; LaPradd, Michelle; Bakoyannis, Giorgos; Carpenter, Janet S",Western journal of nursing research,https://doi.org/10.1177/0193945920942252; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32680445/,175
72201,"Increased Rotavirus Prevalence in Diarrheal Outbreak Precipitated by Localized Flooding, Solomon Islands, 2014.",2016,"BACKGROUND Emerging experimental evidence has shown that sirtuin 3 (SIRT3), which is a class III histone deacetylase, participates in the pathological process of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, data mining of current gene expression databases, such as Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), has not been previously performed to determine whether SIRT3 expression is upregulated or downregulated in the brain tissues of AD patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS Eight RNA expression chip datasets of AD brains in the GEO database were selected, and GEO2R analysis was conducted to identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the AD and control groups. Furthermore, the SIRT3 mRNA levels between the AD and control groups and their relationships with the DEGs and diagnosis of AD were evaluated. Finally, Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses of both the AD-related DEGs and the SIRT3-related DEGs were conducted. RESULTS The SIRT3 mRNA levels were downregulated in 7 of 8 databases and were related to the diagnosis of AD in 7 databases, with an area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC curve) greater than 50%. Additionally, GO and KEGG analyses showed that SIRT3 downregulation could affect neuroactive ligand-receptor interactions, the MAPK signaling pathway, long-term potentiation, the calcium signaling pathway and axon guidance in AD patients. CONCLUSIONS SIRT3 mRNA is downregulated in the brain tissues of AD patients, promoting the progression of AD.","Song, Shuang; Li, Bin; Jia, Zhen; Guo, Li",Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,https://doi.org/10.12659/msm.923547; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32747616/,175

In this study, we aimed at mapping the power/interest of various stakeholders in United Arab Emirates (UAE) and exploring their attitudes toward pressing health genomics aspects. The overarching aim of this study is to facilitate the construction of a road map for the full implementation of genomic medicine and pharmacogenomics in the UAE with potential applicability to many healthcare systems around the world. METHODS A qualitative approach using in-depth interview was employed. Heterogeneous stakeholders were identified by experts in the field. The analysis of the data was a hybrid of deductive and inductive approach using NVivo software for coding and analysis. RESULTS 13 interviews were conducted. Following mapping the Mendelow's matrix, we categorized the stakeholders in UAE to promoter, latent, defender, and apathetic. Most of the interviewed stakeholders emphasized the clinical demand for genomic medicine in UAE. However, many of them were less inclined to articulate the need for pharmacogenomics at the moment. The majority of stakeholders in UAE were in favor of building infrastructure for better genetic services in the country. Stakeholder from an insurance sector had contradicting stance about the cost-effectiveness of genomic medicine; the majority were concerned with the legal and ethical aspects of genomic medicine and had an opposing stance on direct-to-consumer kits. CONCLUSIONS Implementing the Mendelow's model will allow the systematic strategy for implementing genomic medicine in UAE. This can be achieved by engaging the key players (promoters and defenders) as well as engaging and satisfying the latent stakeholder.","Rahma, Azhar T; Elbarazi, Iffat; Ali, Bassam R; Patrinos, George P; Ahmed, Luai A; Al-Maskari, Fatima",Public health genomics,https://doi.org/10.1159/000513753; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33730737/,175

Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) allows safe transport of these patients to tertiary care institutions. Our ECMO transportation program was instituted in 2004; here we report results after 5 years of activity. METHODS This is a clinical observational study. Criteria for ECMO center activation were: potentially reversibile respiratory failure, PaO₂ <50 mmHg with FiO₂ >0.6 for >12 hours, PEEP >5 cmH₂0, Lung Injury Score (LIS) ≥3 or respiratory acidosis with pH <7.2, no intracranial bleeding, and no absolute contraindication to anticoagulation. If eligible, a skilled crew applied ECMO at the referral hospital. Transportation was performed with a specially equipped ambulance. RESULTS Sixteen patients were possible candidates for ECMO transfer. Two patients were excluded while 14 (mean±SD, age 35.4±18.6, SOFA 8.4±3.7, Oxygenation Index 43.7±13.4) were transported to our institution (distance covered 102±114 km, global duration of transport 589±186 minutes). Two patients improved after iNO-trial and were transferred and subsequently managed without ECMO. The remaining 12 patients were transferred on veno-venous ECMO with extracorporeal blood flow 2.7±1 L·min⁻¹, gas flow 3.8±1.8 L·min⁻¹, and FiO₂ 1. Data were recorded 30 minutes before and 60 minutes after initiation of ECMO. ECMO improved PCO₂ (75±23 vs. 53±9 mmHg, p<0.01) thus improving pH (7.28±0.13 vs. 7.39±0.05, p<0.01) and allowing a reduction in respiratory rate (35±14 vs. 10±4 breaths/min, p<0.01), minute ventilation (10.1±3.8 vs. 3.7±1.7 L·min⁻¹, p<0.01), and mean airway pressure (26±6.5 vs. 22±5 cmH₂O, p<0.01). No major clinical or technical complications were observed.

However, only few of the genes are discriminatively expressed. How to identify these biomarkers precisely is significant for disease diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy. Many studies utilized pathway information to identify the biomarkers. However, most of these studies only incorporate the group information while the pathway structural information is ignored. In this paper, we proposed a Bayesian gene selection with a network-constrained regularization method, which can incorporate the pathway structural information as priors to perform gene selection. All the priors are conjugated; thus, the parameters can be estimated effectively through Gibbs sampling. We present the application of our method on 6 microarray datasets, comparing with Bayesian Lasso, Bayesian Elastic Net, and Bayesian Fused Lasso. The results show that our method performs better than other Bayesian methods and pathway structural information can improve the result.","Cao, Ming; Fan, Yue; Peng, Qinke",Computational and mathematical methods in medicine,https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/7471516; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34394707/,175

METHODS In June 2020, 111 patients with cancer treated in the supportive care unit of a Comprehensive Cancer Center in Milan and 201 healthy controls from the general population were enrolled and assessed both quantitatively and qualitatively for fears and COVID-19-related beliefs as well as for QoL. RESULTS Fear of COVID-19 was significantly lower among patients (41% vs 57.6%; p = 0.007), as was fear of cancer (61.5% vs 85.6%; p < 0.001) and other diseases. The perceived risk of getting COVID-19 was lower among patients (25.2% vs 52.7%; p < 0.001), as was the belief of having been exposed to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (18.1% vs 40.8%; p < 0.001). The physical component of QoL was better among the population (54.5 vs 43.8; p < 0.001); the reverse was true for patients' psychological well-being (44.6 vs 39.6; p < 0.001). The qualitative data supported such results, showing a reduced psychological effect on the patients with cancer compared to the controls. Various reasons explain this result, including the awareness of being treated for cancer and nevertheless protected against getting infected in a cancer center of public health reorganized to continue treating patients by protecting them and personnel from the risk of infection. CONCLUSIONS The experience of a cancer diagnosis, together with proper hospital reorganization, may act as protective factors from fears and psychological consequences of the COVID-19 outbreak.","Ripamonti, Carla Ida; Massa, Giacomo; Insolvibile, Daniela; Guglielmo, Mauro; Miccinesi, Guido; Regalia, Camillo; Saita, Emanuela; Pagnini, Francesco",Tumori,https://doi.org/10.1177/03008916211022848; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34176373/,175

We conducted a retrospective study of all deaths in PICU of an academic Children Hospital between 2012 and 2020, tracing the organ donation activity. Patients were categorized as brain deaths, deaths despite maximal resuscitation, and deaths after withdrawal or limitation of life support. Patient demographics, premortem physiology, end-of-life circumstances, and functional warm ischemia time were recorded. Eligible donors after cardiac death were identified by the absence of medical contraindication and functional warm ischemia time <60 minutes. Of 124 deaths that occurred during the study period, 34 met criteria for brain death, 23 were potential donors, and 13 became actual donors. Of the remaining 90 patients that met criteria for cardiac death, 66 died despite maximal resuscitation, 24 died after withdrawal or limitation of care and between them 13 were identified as theoretically eligible DCD donors. Of these, 5 patients had a functional warm ischemia time of <1 hour and were potential candidates for DCD of 10 kidneys and 2 lungs.

77040,Current progress in stem cell therapy for type 1 diabetes mellitus.,2020-07-08,"BACKGROUND Recently the Composite Variability Index (CVI) was developed to quantify nociception. This index is derived from the standard deviations (s) of the Bispectral Index (sBIS) and the electromyogram (sEMG). The primary aim of our study was to compare CVI before and after a noxious stimulus. As secondary end points, we investigated the influence of remifentanil on the CVI and tested the ability of the CVI to indicate patient movement after a noxious stimulus under changing remifentanil concentrations. Furthermore, we measured the increase in CVI after a noxious stimulus in comparison to other clinical variables (BIS, sBIS, sEMG, heart rate [HR], and systolic blood pressure [BP(sys)]). METHODS Twenty-four patients without a history of cardiac disease were investigated. Anesthesia was induced with propofol administered by target-controlled infusion. A standardized noxious electrical stimulus was applied (50 Hz, 70 mA, 30 seconds) to the ulnar nerve at increasing or decreasing remifentanil effect-compartment concentrations (Ce(remi)). Changes in baseline and poststimulus CVI, BIS, sBIS, sEMG, HR, and BP(sys) were investigated. Parameters' ability to indicate movement after a noxious stimulus was evaluated with the prediction probability (P(K)). RESULTS All investigated parameters (except BP(sys)) increased significantly after a noxious stimulus at 0, 1, 2, or 3 ng·mL(-1) Ce(remi). The association between poststimulus maximal parameters and movement were P(K) = 0.81 for HR, P(K) = 0.78 for sEMG, and P(K) = 0.72 for CVI (pairwise difference to CVI statistically nonsignificant). The association between ΔsEMG or ΔCVI (poststimulus value minus baseline value) and movement was significantly higher (P(K) = 0.76 and 0.75, respectively) compared with ΔHR (P(K) = 0.53) (P = 0.008 and P = 0.01, respectively). Receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed a threshold value for movement for ΔCVI of >0.39 (sensitivity of 0.71, specificity of 0.74) and for ΔsEMG of >0.31 (sensitivity of 0.68, specificity of 0.78). CONCLUSION In paralyzed patients, ΔsEMG and ΔCVI might help identify inadequately low levels of analgesia with an acceptable sensitivity and specificity. The impact of profound neuromuscular block on the CVI should be investigated in further studies.","Ellerkmann, Richard Klaus; Grass, Annekathrin; Hoeft, Andreas; Soehle, Martin",Anesthesia and analgesia,https://doi.org/10.1213/ane.0b013e31827ced18; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23400975/,175

METHODOLOGY Distributions of incubation period and serial interval of Jiangxi epidemic data were fitted by ""fitdistrplus"" package of R software, and the meta-analysis was conducted by ""meta"" package of R software. RESULTS Based on the epidemic data of Jiangxi, we found the median days of incubation period and serial interval were 5.9 days [IQR: 3.8 - 8.6] and 5.7 days [IQR: 3.6 - 8.3], respectively. The median days of the infectivity period at pre-symptomatic was 1.7 days [IQR: 1.1 - 2.4]. The meta-analysis based on 64 papers showed the pooled means of the incubation period and serial interval were 6.25 days (95% CrI: 5.75 - 6.75) and 5.15 days (95% CrI: 4.73 - 5.57), respectively. CONCLUSIONS Our results contribute to a better understanding of COVID-19 and provide useful parameters for modelling the dynamics of disease transmission. The serial interval is shorter than the incubation period, which indicates that the patients are infectious at pre-symptomatic period, and isolation of detected cases alone is likely to be difficult to halt the spread of SARS-CoV-2.","Zhang, Tianchen; Ding, Sheng; Zeng, Zhili; Cheng, Huijian; Zhang, Chengfeng; Mao, Xiangqun; Pan, Huanhong; Xia, Guanghui; Che, Daping",Journal of infection in developing countries,https://doi.org/10.3855/jidc.14025; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33839705/,175

METHODS This was a retrospective cross-sectional study examining ED referrals to psychiatry in an inner-city and suburban centre. The authors collected data on gender, age, employment, housing, clinical presentation, time of assessment and admissions, over a 1-month period. RESULTS The total number referred was 213: inner-city n = 109 and suburban n = 104. The inner-city saw a younger population; 47/109 (43%) were aged between 20 and 29 years, compared with 28/104 (27%) of suburban presenters (P value 0.0134). A higher number of presenters were aged over 60 in the suburban centre n = 13/104 (12.5%) versus the inner-city centre 3/109 (2.8%) (P value 0.0084). In the inner-city, the proportion of homeless presenters was significantly higher at 30/109 (28%) versus 5/104 (4.8%) in the suburban setting (P < 0.0001). Presentations related to substances were highest, a total of 73 (34.3%) across both centres, with no significant difference in clinical presentations across the two centres. The majority were seen in the on-call period, 74/109 (67.9%) in the inner-city centre and 66/104 (63.5%) in the suburban centre. The psychiatric admission rate was significantly different between the two centres, with 33/109 (30.3%) patients admitted in the inner-city centre and 13/104 (12.5%) patients admitted in the suburban centre (P value 0.002). CONCLUSIONS A large proportion of ED referrals to psychiatry constitute patients with unmet social and addiction needs, who are seen out of hours. This prompts consideration of expanding both ED and community services to comprise a more multidisciplinary-resourced, 24/7 care model.","McLoughlin, Caoimhe; McLoughlin, Aoibheann; Jain, Sudha; Abdalla, Ahad; Cooney, John; MacHale, Siobhan",Irish journal of medical science,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11845-020-02496-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33392979/,175
77900,"Measles Outbreak among Adults, Northeastern China, 2014.",2016,"Extracellular electron transfer (EET) allows microorganisms to gain energy by linking intracellular reactions to external surfaces ranging from natural minerals to the electrodes of bioelectrochemical renewable energy technologies. In the past two decades, electrochemical techniques have been used to investigate EET in a wide range of microbes, with emphasis on dissimilatory metal-reducing bacteria, such as Shewanella oneidensis MR-1, as model organisms. However, due to the typically bulk nature of these techniques, they are unable to reveal the subpopulation variation in EET or link the observed electrochemical currents to energy gain by individual cells, thus overlooking the potentially complex spatial patterns of activity in bioelectrochemical systems. Here, to address these limitations, we use the cell membrane potential as a bioenergetic indicator of EET by S. oneidensis MR-1 cells. Using a fluorescent membrane potential indicator during in vivo single-cell-level fluorescence microscopy in a bioelectrochemical reactor, we demonstrate that membrane potential strongly correlates with EET. Increasing electrode potential and associated EET current leads to more negative membrane potential. This EET-induced membrane hyperpolarization is spatially limited to cells in contact with the electrode and within a near-electrode zone (<30 μm) where the hyperpolarization decays with increasing cell-electrode distance. The high spatial and temporal resolution of the reported technique can be used to study the single-cell-level dynamics of EET not only on electrode surfaces, but also during respiration of other solid-phase electron acceptors.","Pirbadian, Sahand; Chavez, Marko S; El-Naggar, Mohamed Y",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2000802117; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32747561/,175

This online survey captured the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on nuclear medicine services in Germany comparing 2020 to 2019. MATERIALS AND METHODS A web-based questionnaire was developed to record the 2020 numbers of nuclear medicine procedures and, in particular, the change compared with 2019. The changes in nuclear medicine diagnostics and therapy were queried, as well as the extent to which ""Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2"" recommendations provided by the DGN were implemented. RESULTS 91 complete responses were recorded and evaluated. This corresponds to about 20 % of all German nuclear medicine facilities. Nuclear medicine diagnostic tests showed a decrease in scintigraphies for thyroid (15.9 %), bone (8.8 %), lung (7.6 %), sentinel lymph nodes (5.5 %), and myocardium (1.4 %) with small increases in PET/CT examinations (1.2 %) compared with 2019. Among nuclear medicine therapies, reductions were highest for benign indications (benign thyroid 13.3 %, RSO 7.7 %), while changes from 2019 were less pronounced for malignant indications (PRRT: + 2.2 %, PSMA: + 7.4 %, SIRT: -5.9 %, and RJT for thyroid carcinoma -2.4 %). The DGN recommendations for action were fully or partially applied in 90 %. CONCLUSIONS The initial significant reduction in nuclear medicine procedures in the first three weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic did not continue, but there was no compensation of the previously not performed services. The decrease in diagnostics and therapy procedures of benign diseases was particularly severe.","Freudenberg, Lutz S; Essler, Markus; Herrmann, Ken",Nuklearmedizin.

79197,"Macrolide-Resistant Bordetella pertussis, Vietnam, 2016-2017.",2020-10-01,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous hematological malignancy, whose immunological mechanisms are still partially uncovered. Regulatory B cells (Bregs) and CD4+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) are subgroups of immunoregulatory cells involved in modulating autoimmunity, inflammation, and transplantation reactions. Herein, by studying the number and function of Breg and Treg cell subsets in patients with AML, we explored their potential role in the pathogenesis of AML. Newly diagnosed AML patients, AML patients in complete remission, and healthy controls were enrolled. Flow cytometry was used to detect percentages of Bregs and Tregs. ELISA was conducted to detect IL-10 and TGF-β in plasma. The mRNA levels of IL-10 and Foxp3 were measured with RT-qPCR. The relationship of Bregs and Tregs with the clinicopathological parameters was analyzed. There was a significant reduction in the frequencies of Bregs and an increase of Tregs in newly diagnosed AML patients compared with healthy controls. Meanwhile, patients in complete remission exhibited levels of Bregs and Tregs comparable to healthy controls. Furthermore, compared with healthy controls and AML patients in complete remission, newly diagnosed AML patients had increased plasma IL-10 but reduced TGF-β. IL-10 and Foxp3 mRNA levels were upregulated in the newly diagnosed AML patients. However, there were no significant differences in IL-10 and Foxp3 mRNA levels between patients in complete remission and healthy controls. Bregs and Tregs have abnormal distribution in AML patients, suggesting that they might play an important role in regulating immune responses in AML.","Dong, Qiaofeng; Li, Guosheng; Fozza, Claudio; Wang, Shuli; Yang, Shuhuan; Sang, Yuqi; Liu, Xinguang; Chen, Chunyan",BioMed research international,https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/7023168; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33083479/,175

Main outcome measures were laboratory task completion times and student survey responses. RESULTS Students showed improvement in time needed to complete skills tasks with practice. Mean times improved for all 5 tasks (P ≤ .01). Students uniformly reported that the course was valuable. The curriculum is now taught and sustained by local faculty. CONCLUSIONS The development and implementation of a collaborative and sustainable laparoscopic curriculum is possible in a low-resource environment.

During storage, RBC undergoes various biophysical and biochemical changes (commonly known as storage lesion) for which blood transfusion with ""old RBC"" shows a lot of clinical problems especially relevant to critically ill patients. Recent research on S-nitrosylation of haemoglobin to improve oxygen delivery of banked blood revealed the important role of nitric oxide (NO) in protecting storage lesion. MATERIALS AND METHODS In the present study, we used various ""NO donating"" chemicals with different NO release dynamics and chemistries in RBC storage cocktails to test the effects of NO on storage lesion. Changes in different storage markers were evaluated after 7 days storage of pre-treated RBC. RESULTS All the NO donors have shown protection against hemolysis. However, S-nitroso glutathione (GSNO) ranks first in shielding RBCs from storage lesion and additionally it helps in elevating the value of 2, 3-di phosphoglycerate (2, 3-DPG), improving the RBC membrane fluidity and decreasing the adhesion towards endothelial monolayer. DISCUSSION Present study reveals that NO released from NO donors confers protection against storage lesions of the RBC. Further, the study confirms that pre-treatment with GSNO, a NO donor and a nitrosylating agent, ensures the best protection to RBC during low temperature storage, when compared to other NO donor treatments.","Sengupta, Prattusha; Mahalakshmi, Vijayaraghavan; Stebin, Justus Jijo; Ganesh, Subhadra; Suganya, Natarajan; Chatterjee, Suvro",Transfusion clinique et biologique : journal de la Societe francaise de transfusion sanguine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tracli.2020.07.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32763478/,175

The objective of this study was to review surgical outcomes of MD and evaluate the feasibility of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) in MD. Methods We performed a retrospective analysis of the medical records of patients who underwent diverticulectomy for MD at 6 Hallym University-affiliated hospitals between January 2008 and December 2017. All patients underwent either open surgery or MIS. Patients who underwent MIS were subdivided into laparoscopic only diverticulectomy (LOD) or laparoscopic-assisted diverticulectomy (LAD). Results Of 64 patients, 21 underwent open surgery and 43 underwent MIS. Time to flatus, time to soft food intake, and length of hospital stay were shorter in the MIS group than in the open surgery group (P = 0.047, P = 0.005, and P = 0.015, respectively). Among patients who underwent MIS, the time to flatus and time to soft food intake were longer in the LAD group than in the LOD group (0.3 and 0.9 days, respectively). Multivariate analysis showed that old age and preoperative ileus were independent predictors of complications (P = 0.030 and P = 0.013, respectively). Operation type (open surgery, LOD, or LAD) was not associated with complications. Conclusion The present study showed that MIS is associated with quicker recovery without increasing complications. Therefore, MIS may be a safe alternative to open surgery for MD. An old age and preoperative ileus were associated with a risk of postoperative complications.","Jung, Hong Sub; Park, Jun Ho; Yoon, Sang Nam; Kang, Byung Mo; Oh, Bo Young; Kim, Jong Wan",Annals of surgical treatment and research,https://doi.org/10.4174/astr.2020.99.4.213; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33029480/,175
80959,Association between mannose-binding lectin gene polymorphism and pediatric cytomegalovirus infection.,2010,"BACKGROUND Advances in minimally invasive surgery for live kidney donors have led to the development of laparoendoscopic single site donor nephrectomy (LESS-DN). At present, laparoscopic donor nephrectomy is the technique of choice for donor nephrectomy globally. Compared with open surgical approaches, laparoscopic donor nephrectomy is associated with decreased morbidity, faster recovery times and return to normal activity, and shorter hospital stays. LESS-DN differs from standard laparoscopic donor nephrectomy; LESS-DN requires a single incision through which the procedure is performed and donor kidney is removed. Previous studies have hypothesised that LESS-DN may provide additional benefits for kidney donors and stimulate increased donor rates. OBJECTIVES This review looked at the benefits and harms of LESS-DN compared with standard laparoscopic nephrectomy for live kidney donors. SEARCH METHODS We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant's Specialised Register to 28 January 2016 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. SELECTION CRITERIA We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared LESS-DN with laparoscopic donor nephrectomy in adults. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Three authors independently assessed studies for eligibility and conducted risk of bias evaluation. Summary estimates of effect were obtained using a random-effects model and results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) or risk difference (RD) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes, and mean difference (MD) and 95% CI for continuous outcomes. MAIN RESULTS We included three studies (179 participants) comparing LESS-DN with laparoscopic donor nephrectomy. There were no significant differences between LESS-DN and laparoscopic donor nephrectomy for mean operative time (2 studies, 79 participants: MD 6.36 min, 95% CI -11.85 to 24.57), intra-operative blood loss (2 studies, 79 participants: MD -8.31 mL, 95% CI -23.70 to 7.09), or complication rates (3 studies, 179 participants: RD 0.05, 95% CI -0.04 to 0.14). Pain scores at discharge were significantly less in the LESS-DN group (2 studies, 79 participants: MD -1.19, 95% CI -2.17 to -0.21). For all other outcomes (length of hospital stay; length of time to return to normal activities; blood transfusions; conversion to another form of surgery; warm ischaemia time; total analgesic requirement; graft loss) there were no significant differences observed.Although risk of bias was assessed as low overall, one study was assessed at high risk of attrition bias.

This study aimed to clarify whether pelvic floor PC affected short-term outcomes. METHODS The study group comprised patients with the pathologically confirmed diagnosis of rectal cancer who underwent E-LAR with pelvic floor PC or with no PC (NPC) between January 2013 and December 2018 in Southwest Hospital. After propensity score matching (PSM), 584 patients (292 who underwent PC and 292 who underwent NPC) were evaluated. Postoperative indicators, including the rates of complications, anastomotic leakage (AL), reoperation, and inflammation, were observed in the two groups. RESULTS No significant difference was observed in the rates of postoperative complications between the PC and NPC groups. The rates of AL were similar (11.3% vs. 9.2%, p = .414). However, the reoperation rate of patients in the PC group was significantly lower than that of patients in the NPC group after AL (36.4% vs. 11.1%, p = .025). The hospital costs were higher in the NPC leakage subgroup (p = .001). Additionally, the serum C-reactive protein levels were lower in the PC group on postoperative days (PODs) 1, 3, and 5, whereas procalcitonin levels on POD 1 and 3 were lower in the PC group but did not differ significantly on POD 5. CONCLUSION Pelvic peritonization did not affect the rate of complications, especially AL; however, it effectively reduced the reoperation and inflammation rates and reduced hospitalization costs. Other short-term outcomes were similar, which warrant the increased use of pelvic peritonization in endoscopic surgery.","Chuan, Li; Linfeng, Gao; Hongchang, Liu; Xiaosong, Wang; Huaxing, Luo; Chao, Zhang; Yu, Peiwu; Bo, Tang",Journal of surgical oncology,https://doi.org/10.1002/jso.26238; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33047338/,175

Patients and methods In a double-blind multicentre Phase 3 study, patients received prophylactic liposomal amphotericin B (L-AMB) at 5 mg/kg intravenously or placebo twice weekly in a 2:1 random allocation during remission-induction treatment. The primary endpoint was the development of proven or probable IFD. Secondary endpoints included those focused on the safety and tolerability of prophylactic L-AMB. Results Three hundred and fifty-five patients from 86 centres in Europe and South America received at least one dose of L-AMB ( n = 237) or placebo ( n = 118). Rates of proven and probable IFD assessed independently were 7.9% (18/228) in the L-AMB group and 11.7% (13/111) in the placebo group ( P = 0.24). Rates of possible IFD were 4.8% (11/228) in the L-AMB and 5.4% (6/111) in the placebo group ( P = 0.82). The remission-induction phase was a median of 22 days for both groups. Overall mortality was similar between the groups: 7.2% (17/237) for L-AMB and 6.8% (8/118) for placebo ( P = 1.00). Hypokalaemia and creatinine increase were significantly more frequent with L-AMB. Conclusions The IFD rate among adult patients undergoing remission-induction chemotherapy for newly diagnosed ALL was 11.7% in the placebo group, and was not significantly different in patients receiving L-AMB, suggesting that the L-AMB regimen studied is not effective as prophylaxis against IFD. The IFD rate appears higher than previously reported, warranting further investigation. Tolerability of L-AMB was what might be expected.

While IM-MS is an increasingly powerful analytical technique, significant bottlenecks related to the resolution of measurements have kept it from becoming broadly applied for biological analyses. Presently, IM-MS-based measurements also remain limited in terms of their sensitivity as compared to state of the art MS-based approaches alone. Structures for Lossless Ion Manipulations (SLIM)-based IM separations provide a basis for overcoming these bottlenecks, addressing issues associated with resolution and sensitivity in the omics, and potentially opening the door to much broader application.","Garimella, Sandilya V B; Nagy, Gabe; Ibrahim, Yehia M; Smith, Richard D",Trends in analytical chemistry : TRAC,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trac.2019.04.021; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32831434/,175

Conclusions about HRQL are difficult to make as the participants are likely drawn from different countries. A global estimate of HRQL with estimates of variation would permit pooling of data from diverse sources. The aim was to estimate a global HRQL score of typically developing children and adolescents on the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL™) and to identify sources of variation across studies. METHODS A systematic search was conducted in December 2018 on four databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and PsycINFO. Inclusion criteria were all population health studies or validation studies using the self-report version of the PedsQL™ for typically developing children aged 5 to 18 years. Quality appraisal was conducted using the Appraisal Tool for Cross-Sectional Studies. Meta-analysis and meta-regression were conducted. RESULTS A total of 66 studies with a sample size of 67,805 participants were included in this analysis. The average QOL score across all studies was 80.9 (CI 78.6-83.2). Univariate analyses showed that region, minimum age of sample and income of country, was associated with the total HRQL score. Subgroup analysis showed that there was an effect of age and region on HRQL scores. CONCLUSION Results of this review provide ranges of pediatric HRQL across personal factors and regions that can be used for normative comparisons of HRQL. Interpretation of scores on generic measures should always take into consideration the contextual influences in the child's life.

In addition, the use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in such children may have a protective effect on the cardiovascular system. Methods Cross-sectional study of randomly selected eighty HIV infected and 80 aged matched non- HIV-infected children were used. HIV-infected children were on HAART for more than 5years and had steadily received the treatment for 6 months prior to the time of the tests. Heights and weights were measured and body mass index calculated. Cardiac indices evaluated were heart rate (HR), PR interval, QRS duration, QT/QTC Interval, P/QRS/T Axis, RV5/SV1 voltage and RV5+SV1 voltage. Results The average heart rate was significantly higher among HIV infected children on HAART than their non-infected counterparts (P= 0.019). At 0.05 significance level, their PR interval was significantly higher than those in the control group (P=0.050). The average QRS duration result also showed a significant difference between that of test and control subjects (P = 0.022). Conclusion The HAART usage possibly improved the cardiovascular functioning in the infected children but the protective effects diminish with increase age and longer exposure.","Eleazar, Emeka Spiff; Eleazar, Clara Idara; Nwachukwu, Daniel Chukwu; Nwagha, Uchenna Ifeanyi",African health sciences,https://doi.org/10.4314/ahs.v20i4.26; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34394234/,175

As of 3rd June, 2021, 172,493,290 individuals have acquired COVID-19 and 3,708,334 patients have died worldwide, according to the World Health Organization. AREAS COVERED This review explores epidemiology; virology; pathogenesis; genomic variations; mode of transmission; clinical occurrence; diagnosis; and treatment with antiviral agents, antibiotics, and supportive therapies. It covers a nanotechnology-based treatment approach and emphasizes the importance of herbal and marine antiviral drugs. The review attempts to explain current advances in research, prevention, and control of COVID-19 spread through artificial intelligence and vaccine development status under cosmopolitan consideration. EXPERT OPINION While COVID-19 research is advancing at full capacity, the discovery of drugs or vaccines that can fight the pandemic is necessary. Human survival in such a critical situation will be possible only with the development of strong immunity by opting for exercise, yoga, and consumption of hygienic food and beverages. Therefore, education about COVID-19 lethality and its impact on livelihood is important. The pandemic has also shown positive effects on the environment, such as a significant reduction in environmental pollution and global warming and improvement in river water quality.","Sarangi, Manoj Kumar; Padhi, Sasmita; Dheeman, Shrivardhan; Karn, Santosh Kumar; Patel, L D; Yi, Dong Kee; Nanda, Sitansu Sekhar",Expert review of anti-infective therapy,https://doi.org/10.1080/14787210.2021.1944103; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34151679/,175
85836,Understanding the Impact of Resistance to Influenza Antivirals.,2021-03-17,"Human noroviruses (NoVs), a major cause of viral gastroenteritis, are difficult to study due to the lack of a cell-culture and a small-animal model. Pigs share with humans the types A and H histo-blood group antigens on the intestinal epithelium and have been suggested as a potential model for studies of NoV pathogenesis, immunity and vaccines. In this study, the effects of age and a cholesterol-lowering drug, simvastatin, on the susceptibility of pigs to NoV infection were evaluated. The median infectious dose (ID50) of a genogroup II, genotype 4 (GII.4) 2006b variant was determined. The ID50 in neonatal (4-5 days of age) pigs was ≤2.74×10(3) viral RNA copies. In older pigs (33-34 days of age), the ID50 was 6.43×10(4) but decreased to <2.74×10(3) in simvastatin-fed older pigs. Evidence of NoV infection was obtained by increased virus load in the intestinal contents, cytopathological changes in the small intestine, including irregular microvilli, necrosis and apoptosis, and detection of viral antigen in the tip of villi in duodenum. This GII.4 variant was isolated in 2008 from a patient from whom a large volume of stool was collected. GII.4 NoVs are continuously subjected to selective pressure by human immunity, and antigenically different GII.4 NoV variants emerge every 1-2 years. The determination of the ID50 of this challenge virus is valuable for evaluation of protection against different GII.4 variants conferred by NoV vaccines in concurrence with other GII.4 variants in the gnotobiotic pig model.","Bui, Tammy; Kocher, Jacob; Li, Yanru; Wen, Ke; Li, Guohua; Liu, Fangning; Yang, Xingdong; LeRoith, Tanya; Tan, Ming; Xia, Ming; Zhong, Weiming; Jiang, Xi; Yuan, Lijuan",The Journal of general virology,https://doi.org/10.1099/vir.0.054080-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23804568/,175

The standard laparoscopic approach is based on the three-port technique. In contrast to the standard laparoscopic technique, the single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) requires only one incision. We report on our experience with this surgical approach. MATERIALS AND METHODS Between September 2009 and August 2010 a total of 24 children underwent a laparoscopic pyloromyotomy, 12 in SILS technique. The single incision was carried through the center of the umbilicus. The working instruments were introduced in a two-dimensional direction into the peritoneal cavity via the same umbilical incision. The two groups were compared for patients' demographics, operative report and early postoperative outcomes. RESULTS All SILS procedures were performed successfully with no conversion rate. There were no differences in the preoperative parameters between the two groups regarding age before surgery and body weight at operation. Operative time and time of full enteral intake was similar to comparable procedures with usage of a standard laparoscopic approach. There were no operative or postoperative complications. CONCLUSIONS The early experience described in this study confirms that SILS can be applied for treatment of pyloric stenosis with outcomes similar to the standard laparoscopic surgery.","Kozlov, Yury; Novogilov, Vladimir; Podkamenev, Alexey; Rasputin, Andrey; Weber, Irina; Solovjev, Alexey; Yurkov, Pavel",Pediatric surgery international,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00383-011-3029-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22179488/,175

86986,New friends for bone marrow plasma cells.,2011,"OBJECTIVE We sought to understand spatial-temporal factors and socioeconomic disparities that shaped U.S. residents' response to COVID-19 as it emerged. METHODS We mined coronavirus-related tweets from January 23rd to March 25th, 2020. We classified tweets by the socioeconomic status of the county from which they originated with the Area Deprivation Index (ADI). We applied topic modeling to identify and monitor topics of concern over time. We investigated how topics varied by ADI and between hotspots and non-hotspots. RESULTS We identified 45 topics in 269,556 unique tweets. Topics shifted from early-outbreak-related content in January, to the presidential election and governmental response in February, to lifestyle impacts in March. High-resourced areas (low ADI) were concerned with stocks and social distancing, while under-resourced areas shared negative expression and discussion of the CARES Act relief package. These differences were consistent within hotspots, with increased discussion regarding employment in high ADI hotspots. DISCUSSION Topic modeling captures major concerns on Twitter in the early months of COVID-19. Our study extends previous Twitter-based research as it assesses how topics differ based on a marker of socioeconomic status. Comparisons between low and high-resourced areas indicate more focus on personal economic hardship in less-resourced communities and less focus on general public health messaging. CONCLUSION Real-time social media analysis of community-based pandemic responses can uncover differential conversations correlating to local impact and income, education, and housing disparities. In future public health crises, such insights can inform messaging campaigns, which should partly focus on the interests of those most disproportionately impacted.","Su, Yihua; Venkat, Aarthi; Yadav, Yadush; Puglisi, Lisa B; Fodeh, Samah J",Computers in biology and medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiomed.2021.104336; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33761419/,175

The SARS-CoV-2 neurotropic RNA virus is triggering neurological complications and deep concern regarding acceleration of neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative processes already in progress. This review, based on our MMC experience, will discuss two major issues: 1) why residents chronically exposed to air pollution are likely to be more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 systemic and brain effects and 2) why young people with AD and PD already in progress will accelerate neurodegenerative processes. Secondary mental consequences of social distancing and isolation, fear, financial insecurity, violence, poor health support, and lack of understanding of the complex crisis are expected in MMC residents infected or free of SARS-CoV-2. MMC residents with pre-SARS-CoV-2 accumulation of misfolded proteins diagnostic of AD and PD and metal-rich, magnetic nanoparticles damaging key neural organelles are an ideal host for neurotrophic SARS-CoV-2 RNA virus invading the body through the same portals damaged by nanoparticles: nasal olfactory epithelium, the gastrointestinal tract, and the alveolar-capillary portal.

Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are the most commonly used controller medications in patients with asthma. It is unclear whether ICS use increases the risk for severe COVID-19 infection. At the current time, asthma organizations are still recommending the continued use of ICS and other asthma medications to minimize the risk of uncontrolled asthma. However, for patients with asthma and who have recovered from COVID-19 infection, the timing of resumption of asthma therapy is equally uncertain. Pulmonary function testing and exhaled oral nitric oxide testing are aerosol-generating procedures and are currently being severely restricted at most health-care facilities. We presented a case of a patient with cough-variant asthma who developed severe COVID-19 associated acute respiratory distress syndrome with the need for intubation and prolonged mechanical ventilation.

PURPOSE To describe the study design and methodology of the Manhattan Vision Screening and Follow-up Study in Vulnerable Populations, which aims to investigate whether community-based vision screenings can improve detection and management of glaucoma, vision impairment, cataract, and other eye diseases among vulnerable populations living in affordable housing developments in upper Manhattan. METHODS This 5-year prospective, cluster-randomized, controlled trial consists of vision screening and referral for follow-up eye care among eligible residents aged 40 and older. Visual acuity, intraocular pressure (IOP), and fundus photography are measured. Participants with visual worse than 20/40, or IOP 23-29▒mmHg, or unreadable fundus images fail the screening and are scheduled with the on-site optometrist. If IOP is ≥30▒mmHg, participants are assigned as ""fast-track"" and referred to ophthalmology. Participants living in seven developments randomized to the Enhanced Intervention Group who fail the screening and need vision correction receive complimentary eyeglasses. Those referred to ophthalmology receive enhanced support with patient navigators to assist with follow-up eye care. Participants living in three developments randomized to the Usual Care Group who fail the screening and need vision correction are given an eyeglasses prescription only and a list of optical shops. No enhanced support is given to the Usual Care Group. All participants referred to ophthalmology are assisted in making their initial eye exam appointment.

A useful pathological animal model accurately reflecting human pathology is needed to overcome the COVID-19 crisis. In the present study, COVID-19 cynomolgus monkey models including monkeys with underlying diseases causing severe pathogenicity such as metabolic disease and elderly monkeys were examined. Cynomolgus macaques with various clinical conditions were intranasally and/or intratracheally inoculated with SARS-CoV-2. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 was found in mucosal swab samples, and a higher level and longer period of viral RNA was detected in elderly monkeys than in young monkeys. Pneumonia was confirmed in all of the monkeys by computed tomography images. When monkeys were readministrated SARS-CoV-2 at 56 d or later after initial infection all of the animals showed inflammatory responses without virus detection in swab samples. Surprisingly, in elderly monkeys reinfection showed transient severe pneumonia with increased levels of various serum cytokines and chemokines compared with those in primary infection.

In this paper we examine Disability Living Allowance (DLA), a non means-tested contribution towards disability-related living costs for disabled people aged less than sixty-five. METHOD ology: Three census-based measures of self-reported health (number of chronic physical disabilities; activity limitation (a little; a lot); and chronic poor mental health) were linked to contemporaneous DLA records. The 2011 Census returns provided individual demographic, socio-economic, social and area-level characteristics. DLA uptake was modelled using logistic regression, stratified into 0-15 and 16-64 year old age groups. RESULTS Overall, 118329 (8.4%) of this population received DLA. Poor health outcomes were the main determinants for uptake, which was higher amongst females, those non-married and those of lower socio-economic status: for example those with no qualifications compared against third level education (ORad = 1.80: 95%CI = 1.75-1.85); and those social renting compared against those in more expensive owner occupation (ORadj = 1.92: 1.83-2.02). Uptake was lower amongst Protestants than Catholics (ORadj = 0.75: 0.74-0.77) and amongst immigrants (ORadj = 0.36: 0.34-0.39) and slightly lower in rural communities. CONCLUSIONS Poor health is the predominant determinant of disability benefits uptake but other social and socioeconomic factors have influence. These findings may assist in the reshaping of outreach programmes leading to better targeting of benefits, and therefore a more indirect influence on the derivation of area deprivation measures in the United Kingdom.","O'Reilly, Dermot; Rosato, Michael; Wright, David M; Millar, Ana Corina; Tseliou, Foteini; Maguire, Aideen",Social science & medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2021.113821; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33740635/,175

90787,Multiple CD4+ T cell subsets produce immunomodulatory IL-10 during respiratory syncytial virus infection.,2011,"While the sustainability of resource depletion is a longstanding environmental concern, wider attention has recently been given to growing water scarcity and groundwater depletion. This study seeks to test the substitutability assumption embedded in weak sustainability indicators using a case study of Californian water supply. The volume of groundwater depletion is used as a proxy for unsustainable water consumption, and defined by synthesising existing research estimates into low, medium and high depletion baselines. These are compared against projected water supply increases from ocean desalination and water recycling by 2035, to determine whether new, drought-proof water sources can substitute for currently unsustainable groundwater consumption. Results show that the maximum projected supply of new water, 2.47 million acre-feet per year (MAF/yr), is sufficient to meet low depletion estimates of 2.02 MAF/yr, but fails to come near the high depletion estimate of 3.44 MAF/yr. This does not necessarily indicate physical limitations of substitutability, but more so socio-economic limitations influenced by high comparative costs. By including capacities in demand-substitutability via urban water conservation, maximum predicted capacities reach 5.57 MAF/yr, indicating wide room for substitution. Based on these results, investment in social and institutional capital is an important factor to enhance demand-side substitutability of water and other natural resources, which has been somewhat neglected by the literature on the substitutability of natural resources.","Badiuzzaman, Pierre; McLaughlin, Eoin; McCauley, Darren",Journal of environmental management,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2017.06.051; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28783009/,175
90923,Genome Sequencing of Leishmania infantum Causing Cutaneous Leishmaniosis from a Turkish Isolate with Next-Generation Sequencing Technology.,2020-07-20,"The Murine hepatitis virus (MHV) strain A59 ns2 protein is a 30-kDa nonstructural protein that is expressed from a subgenomic mRNA in the cytoplasm of virus-infected cells. Its homologs are also encoded in other closely related group 2a coronaviruses and more distantly related toroviruses. Together, these proteins comprise a subset of a large superfamily of 2H phosphoesterase proteins that are distinguished by a pair of conserved His-x-Thr/Ser motifs encompassing catalytically important residues. We have used a vaccinia virus-based reverse genetic system to produce recombinant viruses encoding ns2 proteins with single-amino-acid substitutions in, or adjacent to, these conserved motifs, namely, inf-ns2 H46A, inf-ns2 S48A, inf-ns2-S120A, and inf-ns2-H126R. All of the mutant viruses replicate in mouse 17 clone 1 fibroblast cells and mouse embryonic cells to the same extent as the parental wild-type recombinant virus, inf-MHV-A59. However, compared to inf-MHV-A59, the inf-ns2 H46A and inf-ns2-H126R mutants are highly attenuated for replication in mouse liver following intrahepatic inoculation. Interestingly, none of the mutant viruses were attenuated for replication in mouse brain following intracranial inoculation. These results show that the ns2 protein of MHV-A59 has an important role in virus pathogenicity and that a substitution of the histidine residues of the MHV-A59 ns2 His-x-Thr/Ser motifs is critical for virus virulence in the liver but not in the brain. This novel phenotype suggests a strategy to investigate the function of the MHV-A59 ns2 protein involving the search for organ-specific proteins or RNAs that react differentially to wild-type and mutant ns2 proteins.","Roth-Cross, Jessica K; Stokes, Helen; Chang, Guohui; Chua, Ming Ming; Thiel, Volker; Weiss, Susan R; Gorbalenya, Alexander E; Siddell, Stuart G",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02203-08; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19176619/,175
93269,A novel RIP1/RIP3 dual inhibitor promoted OPC survival and myelination in a rat neonatal white matter injury model with hOPC graft.,2021-08-18,"BACKGROUND Given the effect of chronic diseases on risk of severe COVID-19 infection, the present pandemic may have a particularly profound impact on socially disadvantaged counties. METHODS Counties in the USA were categorised into five groups by level of social vulnerability, using the Social Vulnerability Index (a widely used measure of social disadvantage) developed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The incidence and mortality from COVID-19, and the prevalence of major chronic conditions were calculated relative to the least vulnerable quintile using Poisson regression models. RESULTS Among 3141 counties, there were 5 010 496 cases and 161 058 deaths from COVID-19 by 10 August 2020. Relative to the least vulnerable quintile, counties in the most vulnerable quintile had twice the rates of COVID-19 cases and deaths (rate ratios 2.11 (95% CI 1.97 to 2.26) and 2.42 (95% CI 2.22 to 2.64), respectively). Similarly, the prevalence of major chronic conditions was 24%-41% higher in the most vulnerable counties. Geographical clustering of counties with high COVID-19 mortality, high chronic disease prevalence and high social vulnerability was found, especially in southern USA. CONCLUSION Some counties are experiencing a confluence of epidemics from COVID-19 and chronic diseases in the context of social disadvantage. Such counties are likely to require enhanced public health and social support.","Islam, Nazrul; Lacey, Ben; Shabnam, Sharmin; Erzurumluoglu, A Mesut; Dambha-Miller, Hajira; Chowell, Gerardo; Kawachi, Ichiro; Marmot, Michael",Journal of epidemiology and community health,https://doi.org/10.1136/jech-2020-215626; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33402397/,175

This study was performed to assess the diagnostic utility of stool as a specimen of choice for detection of mycobacterial DNA in paucibacillary TB patients in a TB-endemic setting. Stool samples were collected from 246 subjects including 129 TB patients (62 PTB and 67 EPTB) recruited at TB hospital in Delhi, India. Diagnostic efficacy of stool IS6110 PCR (n = 228) was measured, using microbiologically/clinically confirmed TB as the reference standard. The clinical sensitivity of stool PCR was 97.22% (95% confidence interval (CI), 85.47-99.93) for detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in stool samples of smear-positive PTB patients and 76.92% (CI, 56.35-91.03) in samples from smear-negative PTB patients. Overall sensitivity of PCR for EPTB was 68.66% (CI, 56.16-79.44), with the highest sensitivity for stool samples from patients with lymph node TB (73.5%), followed by abdominal TB (66.7%) and pleural effusion (56.3%). Stool PCR presented a specificity of 95.12%. The receiver operating characteristic curve also indicated the diagnostic utility of stool PCR in TB detection (AUC: 0.882). The performance characteristic of the molecular assay suggests that stool DNA testing has clinical value in detection of TB.","Gaur, Mohita; Singh, Anoop; Sharma, Vishal; Tandon, Gayatri; Bothra, Ankur; Vasudeva, Aarushi; Kedia, Shreeya; Khanna, Ashwani; Khanna, Vishal; Lohiya, Sheelu; Varma-Basil, Mandira; Chaudhry, Anil; Misra, Richa; Singh, Yogendra",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-63901-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32345991/,175

It is also unclear whether physical activity calorie equivalent (PACE) is more effective than standard kilocalorie (kcal) energy labelling in promoting healthier dietary behaviour and whether effectiveness varies based on socioeconomic position (SEP). In the present online study, 1667 UK adults of lower and higher SEP made virtual portion size selections for 18 common main meal foods under one of four conditions: kcal labelling only, PACE labelling only, kcal and PACE labelling, no labelling. Contrary to predictions, participants in the kcal labelling condition (+55 kcal, p < 0.001) chose larger portion sizes compared to the no labelling condition, whereas the PACE labelling (-17 kcal, p = 0.065) and no labelling condition did not significantly differ. The presence of PACE information on labels was associated with selection of significantly smaller portions when compared to labels that only included kcal information. Effects of labels on portion size selection were not moderated by participant SEP in primary analyses. The present study of virtual portion size selections suggests that kcal labelling result in larger portion size selections than no labelling, but this counter-intuitive effect was attenuated when kcal and PACE labelling were combined. Further research examining the impact of PACE labelling on real-world food selection in participants of lower and higher SEP is now warranted.","Marty, Lucile; Franzon, Caterina; Jones, Andrew; Robinson, Eric",Appetite,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2021.105437; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34126162/,175
94002,Identification of deletion mutant respiratory syncytial virus strains lacking most of the G protein in immunocompromised children with pneumonia in South Africa.,2011,"Microbial infections of the central nervous system (CNS) are often associated with local accumulation of antibody (Ab)-secreting cells (ASC). By providing a source of Ab at the site of infection, CNS-localized ASC play a critical role in acute viral control and in preventing viral recrudescence. Following coronavirus-induced encephalomyelitis, the CNS accumulation of ASC is chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 3 (CXCR3) dependent. This study demonstrates that CNS-expressed CXCR3 ligand CXCL10 is the critical chemokine regulating ASC accumulation. Impaired ASC recruitment in CXCL10(-/-) but not CXCL9(-/-) mice was consistent with reduced CNS IgG and κ-light chain mRNA and virus-specific Ab. Moreover, the few ASC recruited to the CNS in CXCL10(-/-) mice were confined to the vasculature, distinct from the parenchymal localization in wild-type and CXCL9(-/-) mice. However, neither CXCL9 nor CXCL10 deficiency diminished neutralizing serum Ab, supporting a direct role for CXCL10 in ASC migration. T cell accumulation, localization, and effector functions were also not affected in either CXCL9(-/-) or CXCL10(-/-) mice, consistent with similar control of infectious virus. There was also no evidence for dysregulation of chemokines or cytokines involved in ASC regulation. The distinct roles of CXCL9 and CXCL10 in ASC accumulation rather coincided with their differential localization. While CXCL10 was predominantly expressed by astrocytes, CXCL9 expression was confined to the vasculature/perivascular spaces. These results suggest that CXCL10 is critical for two phases: recruitment of ASC to the CNS vasculature and ASC entry into the CNS parenchyma.","Phares, Timothy W; Stohlman, Stephen A; Hinton, David R; Bergmann, Cornelia C",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.03307-12; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23302888/,175

METHODS QIAreach QFT measures the level of interferon-γ (IFN-γ) in plasma specimens from blood stimulated by ESAT-6 and CFP-10 peptides in one blood collection tube (equivalent to the TB2 tube of the QFT-Plus). QIAreach QFT was applied to plasma samples from 41 patients with pulmonary TB and from 42 healthy or low-TB-risk individuals. RESULTS Sensitivity and specificity of QIAreach QFT vs. QFT-Plus were 100% (41/41) and 97.6% (41/42), respectively; overall concordance was 98.8% (82/83). All samples were measured within 20 min. The time to result of each sample was significantly correlated with IFN-γ level with a natural logarithmic scale (r = -0.913, p < 0.001). Seven cases in the active TB group were immunocompromised (CD4 <200/μL) and tested positive by QIAreach QFT. CONCLUSIONS QIAreach QFT provides an objective readout with a minimum blood sample volume (1 mL/subject), potentially being a useful point-of-care screening test for TB infection in high-TB-burden, low-resource countries and for immunocompromised patients.","Fukushima, K; Akagi, K; Kondo, A; Kubo, T; Sakamoto, N; Mukae, H",Pulmonology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pulmoe.2021.07.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34362702/,175

However, the pathogenic mechanism of the diseases linked to TDP-43 is largely unknown. We hypothesized that the failure of mRNA transport to neuronal axons by TDP-43 may contribute to neurodegeneration in ALS and FTLD, and sought to examine the function of TDP-43 by identifying its target mRNA for axonal transport. We found that mRNAs related to translational function including ribosomal proteins (RPs) were decreased by shRNA-based TDP-43 knock-down in neurites of cortical neurons. TDP-43 binds to and transports the RP mRNAs through their 5' untranslated region, which contains a common 5' terminal oligopyrimidine tract motif and a downstream GC-rich region. We showed by employing in vitro and in vivo models that the RP mRNAs were translated and incorporated into native ribosomes locally in axons to maintain functionality of axonal ribosomes, which is required for local protein synthesis in response to stimulation and stress to axons. We also found that RP mRNAs were reduced in the pyramidal tract of sporadic ALS cases harboring TDP-43 pathology. Our results elucidated a novel function of TDP-43 to control transport of RP mRNAs and local translation by ribosomes to maintain morphological integrity of neuronal axons, and proved the influence of this function of TDP-43 on neurodegeneration in ALS and FTLD associated with TDP-43 proteinopathy.","Nagano, Seiichi; Jinno, Junki; Abdelhamid, Rehab F; Jin, Yinshi; Shibata, Megumi; Watanabe, Shohei; Hirokawa, Sachiko; Nishizawa, Masatoyo; Sakimura, Kenji; Onodera, Osamu; Okada, Hironori; Okada, Takashi; Saito, Yuko; Takahashi-Fujigasaki, Junko; Murayama, Shigeo; Wakatsuki, Shuji; Mochizuki, Hideki; Araki, Toshiyuki",Acta neuropathologica,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00401-020-02205-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32803350/,175

This article critically evaluates the existing research on e-learning in plastic surgery. METHODS A systematic review of e-learning in plastic surgery was conducted using the PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, and Embase databases. Studies were limited to those written in English and published after 1995 and excluded short communications, letters to the editor, and articles focused on in-person simulation. RESULTS A total of 23 articles were identified. Represented subspecialties include breast, burns, craniofacial/pediatrics, hand, and microsurgery. Most e-learning resources target surgeons and trainees, but a small number are for patients, parents, and referring physicians. Users reported high levels of satisfaction with e-learning and significant gains in knowledge after completion, although there may be more variable satisfaction with teaching technical skills. Two studies showed no differences in knowledge gains from e-learning compared with traditional learning methods. Subgroup analysis showed greater benefit of e-learning for novice learners when evaluated. Surveys of plastic surgeons and trainees showed high interest in and growing utilization of e-learning. CONCLUSIONS Research in plastic surgery e-learning shows high user satisfaction and overall improvements in learning outcomes with knowledge gains equivalent to traditional teaching methods and greater benefit in novice learners. Thus, e-learning can serve an important role in plastic surgery education, especially in the current state of social distancing.

We developed a new minimally invasive surgical procedure by combining the subxiphoid approach performed through a midline camera port with the use of a robotic surgery system (Intuitive Surgical, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). A 3-cm transverse incision was made 1 cm below the xiphoid process. Then, a port designed for single-port surgery was inserted. Through this port, CO2 gas was injected at 8 mmHg. The thymus was then detached from the back of the sternum. A 1-cm skin incision was made bilaterally in the sixth intercostal space, followed by insertion of a port for the robotic system. A camera port was inserted into the subxiphoid port, to which the camera scope was mounted, and thymectomy was performed. We have performed the operation in 3 patients. In our experience, this procedure provides a good operative view in the neck region and makes verification of the phrenic nerve easy. Furthermore, with the da Vinci surgical system, which enables surgical manipulation from a correct angle due to the multijoint robotic arms, trans-subxiphoid robotic thymectomy may be a promising new thymectomy procedure.","Suda, Takashi; Tochii, Daisuke; Tochii, Sachiko; Takagi, Yasushi",Interactive cardiovascular and thoracic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1093/icvts/ivv001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25697983/,175

96616,"Stem cells protect the bronchial stump in rat, increasing Sox6, Col2a1, and Agc1 expression.",2014,"UNLABELLED Simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV) causes a severe and almost uniformly fatal viral hemorrhagic fever in Asian macaques but is thought to be nonpathogenic for humans. To date, the SHFV life cycle is almost completely uncharacterized on the molecular level. Here, we describe the first steps of the SHFV life cycle. Our experiments indicate that SHFV enters target cells by low-pH-dependent endocytosis. Dynamin inhibitors, chlorpromazine, methyl-β-cyclodextrin, chloroquine, and concanamycin A dramatically reduced SHFV entry efficiency, whereas the macropinocytosis inhibitors EIPA, blebbistatin, and wortmannin and the caveolin-mediated endocytosis inhibitors nystatin and filipin III had no effect. Furthermore, overexpression and knockout study and electron microscopy results indicate that SHFV entry occurs by a dynamin-dependent clathrin-mediated endocytosis-like pathway. Experiments utilizing latrunculin B, cytochalasin B, and cytochalasin D indicate that SHFV does not hijack the actin polymerization pathway. Treatment of target cells with proteases (proteinase K, papain, α-chymotrypsin, and trypsin) abrogated entry, indicating that the SHFV cell surface receptor is a protein. Phospholipases A2 and D had no effect on SHFV entry. Finally, treatment of cells with antibodies targeting CD163, a cell surface molecule identified as an entry factor for the SHFV-related porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, diminished SHFV replication, identifying CD163 as an important SHFV entry component. IMPORTANCE Simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV) causes highly lethal disease in Asian macaques resembling human illness caused by Ebola or Lassa virus. However, little is known about SHFV's ecology and molecular biology and the mechanism by which it causes disease. The results of this study shed light on how SHFV enters its target cells. Using electron microscopy and inhibitors for various cellular pathways, we demonstrate that SHFV invades cells by low-pH-dependent, actin-independent endocytosis, likely with the help of a cellular surface protein.","Caì, Yíngyún; Postnikova, Elena N; Bernbaum, John G; Yú, Shu Qìng; Mazur, Steven; Deiuliis, Nicole M; Radoshitzky, Sheli R; Lackemeyer, Matthew G; McCluskey, Adam; Robinson, Phillip J; Haucke, Volker; Wahl-Jensen, Victoria; Bailey, Adam L; Lauck, Michael; Friedrich, Thomas C; O'Connor, David H; Goldberg, Tony L; Jahrling, Peter B; Kuhn, Jens H",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02697-14; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25355889/,175

Notably, devastating diseases such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) currently do not have vaccine therapies. Conventional vaccine platforms, such as live attenuated vaccines and whole inactivated vaccines, can be difficult to manufacture, may cause severe side effects, and can potentially induce severe infection. Subunit vaccines carry far fewer safety concerns due to their inability to cause vaccine-based infections. The applicability of protein nanoparticles (NPs) as vaccine scaffolds is promising to prevent infectious diseases, and they have been explored for a number of viral, bacterial, fungal, and parasitic diseases. Many types of protein NPs exist, including self-assembling NPs, bacteriophage-derived NPs, plant virus-derived NPs, and human virus-based vectors, and these particular categories will be covered in this review. These vaccines can elicit strong humoral and cellular immune responses against specific pathogens, as well as provide protection against infection in a number of animal models. Furthermore, published clinical trials demonstrate the promise of applying these NP vaccine platforms, which include bacteriophage-derived NPs, in addition to multiple viral vectors that are currently used in the clinic. The continued investigations of protein NP vaccine platforms are critical to generate safer alternatives to current vaccines, advance vaccines for diseases that currently lack effective prophylactic therapies, and prepare for the rapid development of new vaccines against emerging infectious diseases.

Our objective was to provide selection recommendations for ventilation tubes based on anatomic criteria. STUDY DESIGN Prospective cross-sectional study at a tertiary care hospital. METHODS From January 2010 to June 2010 all patients more than 16 years who underwent computer tomography of the neck were included. Contraindications were intubation, tracheotomy, fractures of the lower jaw, tumors, and head or neck deformities. Radiologic data was used to determine the distance between the lower incisors and cricoid cartilage and the smallest laryngotracheal diameter. The results were correlated with patient characteristics and compared with properties of ventilation tubes. RESULTS One hundred fifty-nine patients were included in the study. The laryngotracheal constriction was subcricoidal with a mean diameter of 15.5 ± 3.2 mm coronal and 17.1 ± 2.6 mm sagittal. The mean distance between lower incisors and cricoid cartilage was 176.5 ± 14.8 mm. Patient height correlated significantly with the coronal subcricoid tracheal diameter (r = .51; P < .001) as well as with the distance between lower incisors and cricoid cartilage (r = .64; P < .001). No statistically significant gender or age-related correlations were found. Despite having the same specifications, tubes from different manufacturers differed considerably in their dimensions. CONCLUSIONS Selection of size and placement of ventilation tubes can be based on patient height. Considerable differences in the dimensions of ventilation tubes necessitate a height-based nomogram for evidence-based tube selection and placement.

At 2 years, the BMI was 33.1 in group A (n = 34) and 28.5 in group B (n = 119) with an adjusted difference in weight loss of 5.6 BMI units between the groups (p < 0.001). Vitamin D status was also better in group B than in group A at follow-up, while there was no difference in side effects. CONCLUSIONS Patients with a remnant stomach of 100-120 ml, and AL and CC with individually adapted lengths had a larger weight loss and better vitamin D status postoperatively without an increase in side effects.","Våge, Villy; Gåsdal, Ronny; Laukeland, Camilla; Sletteskog, Nils; Behme, Jan; Berstad, Arnold; Andersen, John Roger",Obesity surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-011-0496-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21874519/,175
100189,"Clonal spread of Geomyces destructans among bats, midwestern and southern United States.",2012,"Guided imagery and relaxation techniques have many documented benefits yet are not traditionally taught in undergraduate nursing education. These techniques can also be used by clinicians and students to manage their own stress. The impact of teaching guided imagery in an experiential skills lab on undergraduate nursing students was examined in this mixed-methods research study. Goals were to evaluate whether students learning these skills would be more likely to use them in clinical practice, to examine whether learning these skills would provide personal benefits, and to compare personal instruction with video instruction. Students completed questionnaires evaluating the experience in terms of satisfaction, personal benefit, and intent to use. Students provided comments and answered open-ended questions regarding personal and professional benefits and ability to apply knowledge and skills. Results were positive, with students reporting satisfaction with the format, personal benefit from the course, and increased likelihood that they will use the techniques with clients in the future. The lowest scores were on confidence in using the technique with clients. A statistically significant finding is that students preferred personal instruction in the areas of satisfaction with the content, satisfaction with the format, and the value of experience in advance of using these skills with patients (p < .05).","Windle, Stephanie; Berger, Samantha; Kim, Jung Eun E",Journal of holistic nursing : official journal of the American Holistic Nurses' Association,https://doi.org/10.1177/0898010120938558; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32633610/,175

We searched 10 databases for studies published between January 2001 to December 2019 that compared mortality at private hemodialysis facilities. We included observational studies directly comparing adjusted mortality rates between FP and NFP private hemodialysis providers in any language or country. We excluded evaluations of dialysis facilities that changed their profit status, studies with overlapping data, and studies that failed to adjust for patient age and some measure of clinical severity. Pairs of reviewers independently screened all titles and abstracts and the full text of potentially eligible studies, abstracted data, and assessed risk of bias, resolving disagreement by discussion. We included nine observational studies of hemodialysis facilities representing 1,163,144 patient-years. In pooled random-effects meta-analysis, the odds ratio of mortality in FP relative to NFP facilities was 1.07 (95% CI 1.04-1.11). Patients at FP hemodialysis facilities have 7 percent greater odds of death annually than patients with similar risk profiles at NFP facilities. Approximately 3,800 excess deaths might be averted annually if U.S. FP hemodialysis operators matched NFP mortality rates.","Dickman, Samuel; Mirza, Reza; Kandi, Maryam; Incze, Michael A; Dodbiba, Lorin; Yameen, Raad; Agarwal, Arnav; Zhang, Ying; Kamran, Rakhshan; Couban, Rachel; Guyatt, Gordon; Hanna, Steven","International journal of health services : planning, administration, evaluation",https://doi.org/10.1177/0020731420980682; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33323016/,175
101749,Xvent-2 expression in regenerating Xenopus tails.,2020,"The photosynthetic capacity or CO2-saturated photosynthetic rate (Vmax), chlorophyll, and nitrogen are closely linked leaf traits that determine C4 crop photosynthesis and yield. Accurate, timely, rapid, and nondestructive approaches to predict leaf photosynthetic traits from hyperspectral reflectance are urgently needed for high-throughput crop monitoring. Therefore, this study thoroughly evaluated the state-of-the-art physically-based radiative transfer models (RTMs), data-driven partial-least-squares regression (PLSR), and generalized PLSR (gPLSR) models to estimate leaf traits from leaf-clip hyperspectral reflectance, which was collected from maize (Zea mays L.) plots with diverse genotypes, growth stages, treatments of nitrogen fertilizers and ozone stresses in three growing seasons. Results show that leaf RTMs considering bidirectional effects can give accurate estimates of chlorophyll content (Pearson correlation r = 0.95), while gPLSR enabled retrieval of leaf nitrogen concentration (r = 0.85). Using PLSR with field measurements for training, the cross-validation indicates that Vmax can be well predicted from spectra (r = 0.81). The integration of chlorophyll content (strongly related to visible spectra) and nitrogen concentration (linked to shortwave infrared signals) can provide better predictions of Vmax (r = 0.71) than only using either chlorophyll or nitrogen individually. This study highlights leaf chlorophyll content and nitrogen concentration have key and unique contributions to Vmax prediction.","Wang, Sheng; Guan, Kaiyu; Wang, Zhihui; Ainsworth, Elizabeth A; Zheng, Ting; Townsend, Philip A; Li, Kaiyuan; Moller, Christopher; Wu, Genghong; Jiang, Chongya",Journal of experimental botany,https://doi.org/10.1093/jxb/eraa432; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32937655/,175

102830,Comparison of nasopharyngeal flocked swabs and aspirates for rapid diagnosis of respiratory viruses in children.,2008,"PURPOSE To summarize the scope of nomenclature and measurement methods used to document endplate defects in the health sciences literature. METHODS The scoping review followed the York framework and was reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews. The databases of PubMed, Scopus, Embase and CINAHL were searched using key terms. Screening and selection were conducted by two independent reviewers. A standardized, pilot-tested form was used for extracting data, which were analyzed descriptively. RESULTS The review included 211 studies, originating from 29 countries, with the USA (18.8%) and China (12.26%) as leading contributors. Thirty-four different terms for structural endplate defects were reported, but were never defined in most studies (65%). Of the 34 different terms used, some appeared to represent the same phenomenon, while the same terms were occasionally defined differently between studies. Schmorl's nodes were most commonly investigated (n = 99 studies) and defined similarly across studies, with the main difference relating to whether the indentation (node) was required to have a sclerotic margin. There were also similarities in definitions for endplate sclerosis. However, there was great variability in the definitions of other terms, such as lesions, irregularities, abnormalities, erosions and changes. CONCLUSION With the possible exception of Schmorl's nodes, we lack a common language for effectively communicating structural endplate findings. This review provides a foundation and impetus for standardizing terminology and core measures to improve communication and synthesis of the growing body of endplate research to advance related knowledge.

This study evaluated and compared the resultant arterial damage from these devices. MATERIALS AND METHODS Wall damage after 4 wall-contact devices (the Merci retriever, Catch thromboembolectomy system, and Solitaire FR revascularization devices of 4 and 6 mm) and 1 aspiration device (the Penumbra System) was evaluated in the superficial femoral arteries of 20 male swine. Each device was tested with and without intraluminal clot. Twenty control vessels were not subjected to any intervention. Acute histopathologic changes were evaluated. RESULTS In the device samples, endothelial denudation (72.8 ± 29.4% versus 0.9 ± 1.9%, P < .0001), medial layer edema (52 ± 35.9% versus 18.1 ± 27.8%, P = .004), and mural thrombus (5.3 ± 14.2% versus 0%, P = .05) were found to a greater extent compared with the control samples.

DATA SOURCES PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus; inception to January 2019. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA Randomised clinical trials (RCT), cohort studies, case series. DESIGN We summarised exercise prescriptions for all studies and calculated effect sizes with 95% CIs for between-group (RCTs that compared exercise and control groups) and within-group (pre-post exercise) differences in aerobic capacity (VO2), heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and inflammatory markers (interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumour necrosis factor-alpha). We pooled results where possible using random effects models. RESULTS Interventions from 49 studies were summarised; 8% (4/49) met all FITT guidelines; 16% (8/49) met all or most FITT guidelines. Fourteen studies (10 RCTs) reported at least one marker of cardiovascular health or systemic inflammation. Mean differences (95% CI) indicated a small to moderate increase in VO2 (0.84 mL/min/kg; 95% CI 0.37 to 1.31), decrease in HR (-3.56 beats per minute; 95% CI -5.60 to -1.52) and DBP (-4.10 mm Hg; 95% CI -4.82 to -3.38) and no change in SBP (-0.36 mm Hg; 95% CI -3.88 to 3.16) and IL-6 (0.37 pg/mL; 95% CI -0.11 to 0.85). Within-group differences were also small to moderate. CONCLUSIONS In studies of aerobic exercise in patients with knee OA, very few interventions met guideline-recommended dose; there were small to moderate changes in markers of cardiovascular health and no decrease in markers of systemic inflammation.

However, literature reports addressing the challenges for its industrial application, particularly those related to compaction behavior of liquisolid systems, are scarce. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of process parameters and formulation variables on the flowability, wetting, and compaction properties of the liquisolid systems prepared in a fluid bed processor. The experiments with microcrystalline cellulose, as a carrier, were performed according to 23 full factorial design. The effects of liquid content, spray air pressure, and liquid feed rate on the properties of liquisolid systems were investigated. Liquisolid admixtures with microcrystalline cellulose were compared with those prepared with novel carriers, Fujicalin® and Neusilin® US2. ""Out-die"" Heckel, modified Walker, and Kuentz-Leuenberger models were used to analyze the compressibility of liquisolid admixtures. The results obtained showed that an increase in liquid content (in the range of 10 to 15%) led to a decrease in flowability of liquisolid admixtures with microcrystalline cellulose, as well as more pronounced influence of spraying conditions. On the other hand, higher liquid content led to higher compressibility. Fujicalin® and Neusilin® US2 liquisolid admixtures were found to have superior flowability and compressibility in comparison with those with microcrystalline cellulose, despite the considerably higher liquid load (50-55% liquid content in Neusilin® US2 compacts). Acceptable compactibility of the investigated liquisolid systems was observed. The fluid bed processor was shown to be suitable equipment for production of liquisolid systems, but with careful adjustment of process parameters.","Aleksić, Ivana; German Ilić, Ilija; Cvijić, Sandra; Parojčić, Jelena",AAPS PharmSciTech,https://doi.org/10.1208/s12249-020-01781-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32839881/,175
106546,"Heartland Virus in Humans and Ticks, Illinois, USA, 2018-2019.",2020-07-01,"AIMS OF THE STUDY During the transitional phase between the two pandemic waves of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), infection rates were temporarily rising among younger persons only. However, following a temporal delay infections started to expand to older age groups. A comprehensive understanding of such transmission dynamics will be key for managing the pandemic in the time to come and to anticipate future developments. The present study thus extends the scope of previous SARS-CoV-2-related research in Switzerland by contributing to deeper insight into the potential impact of “social mixing” of different age groups on the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections. METHODS The present study examined persons aged 65 years and older with respect to possible SARS-CoV-2 exposure risks using longitudinal panel data from the Swiss COVID-19 Social Monitor. The study used data from two assessments (survey “May” and survey “August”). Survey “May” took place shortly after the release of the lockdown in Switzerland. Survey “August” was conducted in mid-August. To identify at-risk elderly persons, we conducted a combined factor/k-means clustering analysis of the survey data assessed in August in order to examine different patterns of adherence to recommended preventive measures. RESULTS In summary, 270 (survey “May”) and 256 (survey “August”) persons aged 65 years and older were analysed for the present study. Adherence to established preventive measures was similar across the two surveys, whereas adherence pertaining to social contacts decreased substantially from survey “May” to survey “August”. The combined factor/k-means clustering analysis to identify at-risk elderly individuals yielded four distinct groups with regard to different patterns of adherence to recommended preventive measures: a larger group of individuals with many social contacts but high self-reported adherence to preventive measures (n = 86); a small group with many social contacts and overall lower adherence (n = 26); a group with comparatively few contacts and few social activities (n = 66); and a group which differed from the latter through fewer contacts but more social activities (n = 78). Sociodemographic characteristics and risk perception with regard to SARS-CoV-2 infections among the four groups did not differ in a relevant way across the four groups. CONCLUSIONS Although many elderly persons continued to follow the recommended preventive measures during the transitional phase between the two pandemic waves, social mixing with younger persons constitutes a way for transmission of infections across age groups. Pandemic containment among all age groups thus remains essential to protect vulnerable populations, including the elderly.","Haag, Christina; Höglinger, Marc; Moser, André; Hämmig, Oliver; Puhan, Milo; von Wyl, Viktor",Swiss medical weekly,https://doi.org/10.4414/smw.2020.20416; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33277915/,175

Methods This was a prospective, blinded, randomized controlled study of women with a clinical indication for laparoscopic hysterectomy (n = 30) or myomectomy (n = 5). Patients were randomized to either use electrostatic precipitation (EP) during the procedure, or not (No EP, hysterectomy group only). Results Low pressure surgery could be undertaken in 87% of hysterectomy cases (13/15) when using EP to manage the surgical plume, compared to only 53% (8/15) in the No EP group. Overall average rating of the visual field was excellent with EP vs fair for No EP. Average CO2 consumption was reduced by 29% when using EP (16.7L vs 23.5L, p = 0.152). The average number of procedural pauses to vent smoke was lower with EP than the No EP group (1.5 per case vs. 3.7 per case, p = 0.005). Average procedure duration for the EP vs No EP group was 40.5 min vs. 46.9 min (p = 0.987). There were no measurable differences between groups for body temperature, end-tidal CO2, and discharge pain scores. In myomectomy, all five cases could be performed at low pressure, with an excellent visual field rating. Conclusion Electrostatic precipitation enhances low pressure laparoscopic hysterectomy and myomectomy. This was achieved by minimizing interruptions to surgery and exchange of CO2; providing a clear visual field throughout the procedure; and eliminating surgical smoke at the site of origin.","Levine, David; Petroski, Gregory F; Haertling, Tracy; Beaudoin, Teresa",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,https://doi.org/10.4293/jsls.2020.00051; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33100818/,175

Eight trained cyclists/triathletes (41 ± 10 years, VO2 peak: 69 ± 8 mL/kg/min, peak aerobic power: 391 ± 72 W) completed three trials (the first a familiarization) where they cycled at ∼ 55% VO2 peak for 45 min followed by a 15-min time trial (∼75% VO2 peak) under conditions of significant thermal stress (WBGT: 26.7 ± 0.8 °C, frontal convective airflow: 20 km/h). Seven days separated the trials, which were conducted at the same time of day following 24 h of exercise and dietary control. Reliability increased when a familiarization trial was performed, with the resulting coefficient of variation and intraclass correlation coefficient of the work completed during the 15-min time trial, 3.6% and 0.96, respectively.

For this purpose, a tablet containing 50 mg diclofenac potassium (Cataflam(®)) was predissolved in 240 mL of water and this solution was subsequently orally administered to five healthy volunteers under fasted and fed state conditions with or without concomitant use of a proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) (40 mg esomeprazole, Nexiam(®)). Subsequently, total diclofenac content and dissolved intraluminal drug concentrations as well as drug thermodynamic solubility were determined in gastrointestinal aspirates. In all volunteers, gastric supersaturation resulted in precipitation of diclofenac in the stomach. The extent of precipitation correlated well with gastric pH (r = - 0.78). pH dependency of precipitation was corroborated by the absence of precipitate in the stomach after coadministration of a meal and/or a PPI. Diclofenac was found to be fully dissolved in the duodenum in all test conditions. It can be concluded that substantial pH-dependent gastric precipitation of a weakly acidic BCS Class II drug administered as a solution occurs in humans. With regard to its implications for intestinal absorption, results suggest the instantaneous redissolution of gastric drug precipitate upon transfer to the duodenum.","Van Den Abeele, Jens; Brouwers, Joachim; Mattheus, Ruben; Tack, Jan; Augustijns, Patrick",Journal of pharmaceutical sciences,https://doi.org/10.1002/jps.24647; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26375734/,175

We tested ten pediatric HMEs when mechanically ventilating a model lung at respiratory rates of 20 and 30 breaths/min and pressure control of 10, 15, and 20 cmH(2)O. The expiratory gas passed through a heated humidifier. We created two rates of leakage: 3.2 L/min (small) and 5.1 L/min (large) when pressure was 10 cmH(2)O. We measured absolute humidity (AH) at the Y-piece. Results. Without leakage, eight of ten HMEs maintained AH at more than 30 mg/L. With the small leak, AH decreased below 30 mg/L (26.6 to 29.5 mg/L), decreasing further (19.7 to 27.3 mg/L) with the large leak. Respiratory rate and pressure control level did not affect AH values. Conclusions. Pediatric HMEs provide adequate humidification performance when leakage is absent.","Chikata, Yusuke; Sumida, Chihiro; Oto, Jun; Imanaka, Hideaki; Nishimura, Masaji",Critical care research and practice,https://doi.org/10.1155/2012/439267; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22312483/,175
109702,Why not the 'marker' or DIVA vaccines for the control of emerging infectious diseases of humans?,2021-02-08,"INTRODUCTION Various viruses including a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) can infect the kidney. When viruses invade the glomeruli from the bloodstream, glomerular endothelial cells (GECs) initiate the innate immune reactions. We investigated the expression of interferon (IFN)-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats (IFIT) 1/2/3, antiviral molecules, in human GECs treated with a toll-like receptor (TLR) 3 agonist. Role of IFIT1/2/3 in the expression of C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10) was also examined. METHODS Human GECs were cultured and stimulated with polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly IC), a synthetic TLR3 agonist. Real-time qPCR, Western blotting, and ELISA were used to examine the expression of IFIT1/2/3, IFN-β, and CXCL10. RNA interference against IFN-β or IFIT1/2/3 was also performed. RESULTS Expression of IFIT1/2/3 and CXCL10 was induced by poly IC in GECs. The inductions were inhibited by RNA interfering of IFN-β. Knockdown of IFIT1/2/3 decreased the CXCL10 expression. Knockdown of IFIT3 decreased the expression of IFIT1 and IFIT2 proteins. CONCLUSION IFIT1/2/3 and CXCL10 were induced by poly IC via IFN-β in GECs. IFIT1/2/3 may increase the expression of CXCL10 which induces lymphocyte chemotaxis and may inhibit the replication of infected viruses. These molecules may play a role in GEC innate immune reactions in response to viruses.","Imaizumi, Tadaatsu; Hashimoto, Shun; Sato, Riko; Umetsu, Hidenori; Aizawa, Tomomi; Watanabe, Shojiro; Kawaguchi, Shogo; Matsumiya, Tomoh; Seya, Kazuhiko; Ding, Jiangli; Tanaka, Hiroshi",Kidney & blood pressure research,https://doi.org/10.1159/000511915; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33326977/,175
110165,Unbiased parallel detection of viral pathogens in clinical samples by use of a metagenomic approach.,2011,"BACKGROUND Italy was the second country in the world, after China, to be hit by SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Italy's experience teaches that steps to limit people's movement by imposing 'red zones' need to be put in place early by carefully identifying the cities to be included within these areas of quarantine. The assessment of the relationship between the distance from an established outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infection with transmission-linked cases and mortality observed in other sites could provide useful information to identify the optimal radius of red zones. METHODS We investigated the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 cases and the distance of each Italian province from the first outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Italy (the city of Lodi placed in the Lombardia region). In 38 provinces of Lombardia and neighboring regions, we performed a breakpoint analysis to identify the radius of the red zone around Lodi minimizing epidemic spread and mortality in neighboring cities. RESULTS In all Italian provinces, a non-linear relationship was found between SARS-CoV-2 cases and distance from Lodi. In an analysis including the provinces of Lombardia and neighboring regions, SARS-CoV-2 cases and mortality increased when the distance from Lodi reduced below 92 and 140 km, respectively, and such relationships were amplified by ozone (O3) pollution. CONCLUSIONS The breakpoint analysis identifies the radius around the outbreak of Lodi minimizing the public health consequences of SARS-CoV-2 in neighboring cities. Such an approach can be useful to identify the red zones in future epidemics due to highly infective pathogens similar to SARS-CoV-2.","Tripepi, Giovanni; Plebani, Mario; Iervasi, Giorgio; Gori, Mercedes; Leonardis, Daniela; D'Arrigo, Graziella; Fusaro, Maria",European journal of public health,https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckaa221; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33529325/,175

These devices as of yet have not been well validated in the clinical setting in the clinical ranges observed in a critically unwell patient. We will perform a systematic review of all novel wearable and contactless devices in the clinical setting with focus on degree of novelty and the range of vital signs captured. METHODS Ovid MEDLINE including Epub Ahead of Print and In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid Embase, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) database (Ovid), CINAHL with Full Text, searches of the grey literature, cited references of eligible studies through Web of Science, and reference lists of eligible studies will be searched. Outcomes of interest will include the quality of studies in relation to reporting guidelines, limitations of non-invasive technology, and application in different clinical populations. We will perform a qualitative assessment of the novelty of the device and discuss its validation in deteriorating patients. DISCUSSION While novel monitoring devices are often proposed as a solution to problems with infection, discomfort, and frequency of monitoring in the clinical setting it has not yet been established which devices have been validated in clinical settings in the pathological ranges of vital signs that reflect patient deterioration. It is equally unclear what additional value these devices might provide. This systematic review will synthesize published data regarding devices that have been tested and validated in patients AND in a clinical setting AND in reference ranges that reflect severe illness.

111045,Frequent detection of respiratory viruses without symptoms: toward defining clinically relevant cutoff values.,2011,"Childhood obesity is a global public health challenge. Early prevention, particularly during the first 1000 days, is advocated. Health professionals have a role to play in obesity prevention efforts, in part due to the multiple routine contacts they have with parents. We synthesized the evidence for the effectiveness of obesity prevention interventions delivered by health professionals during this time period, as reviews to date have not examined effectiveness by intervention provider. We also explored what behaviour change theories and/or techniques were associated with more effective intervention outcomes. Eleven electronic databases and three trial registers were searched from inception to 04 April 2019. A total of 180 studies, describing 39 trials involving 46 intervention arms, were included. While the number of interventions has grown considerably, we found some evidence for the effectiveness of health professional-delivered interventions during the first 1000 days. Only four interventions were effective on a primary (adiposity/weight) and secondary (behavioural) outcome measure. Twenty-two were effective on a behavioural outcome only. Several methodological limitations were noted, impacting on efforts to establish the active ingredients of interventions. Future work should focus on the conduct and reporting of interventions.","Hennessy, Marita; Heary, Caroline; Laws, Rachel; van Rhoon, Luke; Toomey, Elaine; Wolstenholme, Hazel; Byrne, Molly",Obesity reviews : an official journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity,https://doi.org/10.1111/obr.12924; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31478333/,175

METHODS We conducted a multi-institutional, single-blinded, randomized controlled trial across four university programs; three had pediatric and adolescent gynecology rotations, and two had pediatric and adolescent gynecology fellowship-trained faculty. Applying permutated block randomization, residents were randomized to no intervention or completion of a validated eLearning module on prepubertal bleeding. All residents subsequently completed a pediatric and adolescent gynecology-related knowledge assessment that queried understanding of prepubertal bleeding and an objective structured clinical examination that assessed history collection, performance of a prepubertal genital examination, vaginal culture, and vaginoscopy for a pediatric patient. Objective structured clinical examinations were videotaped and reviewed by two faculty, blinded to randomization group; interrater reliability score was 97%. We calculated descriptive frequencies and compared randomization groups using χ analyses and Fisher exact tests for categorical variables, and median tests for continuous variables; a value of P<.05 was considered significant. RESULTS From July 2018 to June 2019, we invited 115 residents to participate; 97 (83%) completed both objective structured clinical examination and follow-up knowledge assessments. Most were female (91%) and the majority reported limited pediatric and adolescent gynecology didactic or clinical experience, with 36% reporting prior didactics on prepubertal vaginal bleeding and 33% reporting prior exposure to the prepubertal genital examination. Forty-five participants (46%) were randomized to the module and groups were similar across training levels. Residents assigned to the module scored significantly higher on the knowledge assessment (4/5 vs 2/5, P<.001) and objective structured clinical examination (13/16 vs 7/16, P<.001) and were more likely to avoid a speculum in the examination of a pediatric patient (95.6% vs 57.7%, P<.001). CONCLUSION Our pediatric and adolescent gynecology eLearning module resulted in improved short-term resident knowledge and simulated clinical skills among obstetrics and gynecology residents. Applying this learning technique in other programs may help address deficiencies in pediatric and adolescent gynecology education and training.","Huguelet, Patricia S; Abraham, Margaret; Alaniz, Veronica I; Dolinko, Andrey V; Dumont, Tania; Karjane, Nicole; Pearce, Janina V; Ruder, Kara; Wheeler, Carol; Guiahi, Maryam",Obstetrics and gynecology,https://doi.org/10.1097/aog.0000000000004098; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33030868/,175
111255,Use of plasma procalcitonin levels as an adjunct to clinical microbiology.,2010,"Respiratory viral infections are common and can cause significant morbidity and mortality in pediatric patients undergoing hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). The prevalence of disease has been primarily identified from retrospective studies using standard-of-care specimens. The incidence of both asymptomatic respiratory viral detection and symptomatic respiratory viral detection in this high-risk population is not well described. We performed longitudinal, active, prospective surveillance in pediatric HCT patients. Subjects underwent weekly midturbinate swabs (MTSs) for the detection of 18 respiratory viruses and subtypes peri-HCT and 100 days post-HCT. Clinical data were obtained from the medical record. From September 2015 to February 2017, 24 children underwent 29 HCT, and 284 MTSs were collected. Forty-two (15%) specimens were virus-positive from 10 (42%) subjects. Specimens from children undergoing allogeneic HCT were more likely to have a virus detected (17% vs 8%, P = .04) compared with specimens from children undergoing autologous HCT. Sixteen (38%) detections were not associated with symptoms. Almost half (8/17) of the unique viral infections occurred during the HCT hospitalization after a negative specimen, suggesting nosocomial acquisition, and preceded detection from a clinical specimen. Rhinovirus, the most common virus detected, was the only virus detected in 33 (81%) virus-positive specimens; only 11 (33%) rhinovirus detections were asymptomatic. Asymptomatic detection of coronavirus and bocavirus occurred. Asymptomatic respiratory virus detection occurred in more than one-third of the children undergoing HCT. The acquisition of respiratory viruses during HCT hospitalization suggests nosocomial acquisition. Early detection of respiratory viruses during asymptomatic periods could have infection prevention and treatment implications.","Schuster, Jennifer E; Banerjee, Dithi; Ahmed, Ibrahim; Selvarangan, Rangaraj",Pediatric transplantation,https://doi.org/10.1111/petr.13732; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418305/,175

Here, we report the discovery and genetic characterization of a novel virus present in cattle with respiratory disease. Phylogenetic characterization of this virus revealed that it clusters within the subfamily Torovirinae, in the family Coronaviridae. The complete genome consists of only 20,261 nt and represents the smallest reported coronavirus genome. We identified seven ORFs, including the canonical nidovirus ORF1a and ORF1b. Analysis of polyprotein 1ab revealed that this virus, tentatively named bovine nidovirus (BoNV), shares the highest homology with the recently described python-borne nidoviruses and contains several conserved nidovirus motifs, but does not encode the NendoU or O-MT domains that are present in other viruses within the family Coronaviridae. In concert with its reduced genome, the atypical domain architecture indicates that this virus represents a unique lineage within the order Nidovirales.","Tokarz, Rafal; Sameroff, Stephen; Hesse, Richard A; Hause, Ben M; Desai, Aaloki; Jain, Komal; Lipkin, W Ian",The Journal of general virology,https://doi.org/10.1099/vir.0.000166; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25918239/,175

OBJECTIVE This study evaluated the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and tolerability of DA-1229, which is a newly developed DPP IV inhibitor. This study was planned as part of a product development project at the request of the Korean regulatory agency. METHODS A 7 parallel arm dose-escalation study was conducted in healthy Korean male volunteers. A single oral dose of DA-1229 or placebo was given to 10 subjects (8 active + 2 placebo) in each dose group of 1.25, 2.5, 5, 10, 20, 40, or 60 mg. To assess the effects of food, the subjects in the 10-mg dose group received a single dose of DA-1229 10 mg after a high-fat meal, crossing over from the administration of DA-1229 under a fasting state, after a 7-day washout period. Serial blood samples were collected up to 120 hours after drug administration for pharmacokinetic analysis and the assessment of DPP IV activity, and blood samples were collected up to 2 hours after each meal until the next morning of drug administration to evaluate active GLP-1, glucose, and insulin levels. RESULTS Seventy-two subjects, aged 20 to 39 years and weighing 52.1 to 79.8 kg, participated in this study. Twenty-one adverse events were reported; all were mild, and all subjects recovered spontaneously. DA-1229 reached a peak at 3.0 to 5.5 hours after a single oral dose and the concentrations declined, with a terminal t(½) from 32.5 to 39.8 hours. The %CV of C(max) and AUC(0-last) ranged from 11.1% to 54.6%. Dose-proportional pharmacokinetics were confirmed within the dose range by using a linear regression analysis, and the 95% CIs of the slope of the log-transformed C(max) and AUC(0-last) included 1.0. The pharmacokinetics of DA-1229 were unchanged by food. The degree of DPP IV inhibition was dependent on the dose, and groups receiving ≥10 mg exhibited >80% DPP IV inhibition for >24 hours. The %CV of the time of the last quantifiable concentration ranged from 4.6% to 15.2%. C(max) of active GLP-1 was achieved at 30 minutes after meal intake. The active GLP-1 levels were enhanced in groups receiving ≥5 mg. There were no changes in the glucose and insulin levels after DA-1229 administration. CONCLUSIONS DA-1229 was well tolerated within the dose range of 1.25 to 60 mg. DA-1229 pharmacokinetics suggested dose proportionality, and dose-dependent DPP IV inhibition was exhibited.

MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 40 patients with acute ischemic stroke due to large-artery occlusion were treated in five European centers. Clinical and procedural data were collected; self-reported angiographic results and neurologic outcome (discharge and 90 days) were assessed in a standardized manner. RESULTS The median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale at admittance was 16; no patient was treated after 12 h. Intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) was received by 65 % of patients. The territorial distribution was as follows: 87.5 % in the anterior circulation: 62.5 % middle cerebral artery and 25 % internal carotid artery (ICA) terminus, comprising 20 % tandem occlusions; and 12.5 % in the posterior circulation, all of which were vertebrobasilar. Revascularization of TICI 2b-3 was achieved in 38 of 40 (95 %) treatments. Additional devices were utilized in 11 of 40 (28 %) cases after a mean of 2.6 passes with EmboTrap prior to switching. The mean number of EmboTrap passes needed was 1.8, with a mean procedural time to reperfusion of 54 min. One patient (2.5 %), who had not received IVT, experienced symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage post-interventionally. Procedural complications were encountered in 2 of 40 cases (5 %); both patients exhibited ICA dissection that was treated conservatively without clinical sequelae. There were no device-related complications. Of 23 available patients, 8 (35 %) had a good outcome after 90 days. CONCLUSION The procedural results from these five centers suggest that EmboTrap is technically safe. Successful recanalization rates can be expected to be within the range of other stent retrievers.","Kabbasch, C; Mpotsaris, A; Liebig, T; Söderman, M; Holtmannspötter, M; Cronqvist, M; Thornton, J; Mendes Pereira, V; Andersson, T",Clinical neuroradiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00062-014-0352-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25366714/,175

The first confirmed case in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) was reported on 29th January 2020. COVID-19 has fared mildly in the pediatric population according to available literature out of early epicenters of the pandemic. To date there is a lack of published data about COVID-19 infection among children in the Arabian region. OBJECTIVE Investigate the clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, treatment, and outcomes of children with COVID-19. METHODS This cross-sectional multicenter study included children with confirmed COVID-19 infection admitted between March 1st and June 15th, 2020 to three large hospitals in Dubai, UAE. Serial COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing was collected, and patients' demographics, pre-morbid clinical characteristics and inpatient hospital course were investigated. RESULTS 111 children were included in our study and represented 22 nationalities. Fifty-nine (53.2%) were boys. The mean age was 7 years (±5.3). 15.3% of children were younger than 1 year. Only 4 (3.6%) of the patients had pre-existing asthma all of whom had uneventful courses. At presentation 43 (38.7%) were asymptomatic, 68 (61.2%) had mild or moderate symptoms and none had severe illness requiring intensive care. Fever (20.7%), cough (19.8%) and rhinorrhea (15.3%) were the most common presenting symptoms and most symptoms resolved by day 5 of hospitalization. Most patients had no abnormality on chest x-ray. The most common laboratory abnormalities on admission included variations in neutrophil count (24.7%), aspartate transaminase (22.5%), alkaline phosphatase (36.7%) and lactate dehydrogenase (42.5%). Children were infrequently prescribed targeted medications, with only 4 (3.6%) receiving antibiotics. None of the 52 patients tested for viral co-infections were positive. COVID-19 PCR turned negative at a median of 10 days [6-14] after first positive test. Overall, there was no significant difference of time to negative PCR results between symptomatic and asymptomatic children. CONCLUSIONS This study of COVID19 presentations and characteristics presents a first look into the burden of COVID19 infection in the pediatric population in the UAE. We conclude that a large percentage of children experienced no symptoms, and severe disease is uncommon in the UAE. Various laboratory abnormalities were observed despite clinical stability. Ongoing surveillance, contact tracing and public health measures will be important to contain future outbreaks.

117018,Detection of respiratory viruses by molecular methods.,2008,"Background: The authors draw upon their experience with a successful, enterprise-level, telemedicine program implementation to present a ""How To"" paradigm for other academic health centers that wish to rapidly deploy such a program in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic. The advent of social distancing as essential for decreasing viral transmission has made it challenging to provide medical care. Telemedicine has the potential to medically undistance health care providers while maintaining the quality of care delivered and fulfilling the goal of social distancing. Methods: Rather than simply reporting enterprise telemedicine successes, the authors detail key telemedicine elements essential for rapid deployment of both an ambulatory and inpatient telemedicine solution. Such a deployment requires a multifaceted strategy: (1) determining the appropriateness of telemedicine use, (2) understanding the interface with the electronic health record, (3) knowing the equipment and resources needed, (4) developing a rapid rollout plan, (5) establishing a command center for post go-live support, (6) creating and disseminating reference materials and educational guides, (7) training clinicians, patients, and clinic schedulers, (8) considering billing and credentialing implications, (9) building a robust communications strategy, and (10) measuring key outcomes. Results: Initial results are reported, showing a telemedicine rate increase to 45.8% (58.6% video and telephone) in just the first week of rollout. Over a 5-month period, the enterprise has since conducted over 119,500 ambulatory telemedicine evaluations (a 1,000-fold rate increase from the pre-COVID-19 time period).

The aim of current study was evaluating the effects of early anticoagulant treatment in hospitalized Covid-19 patients. METHOD The present retrospective and comparative cohort study investigated 413 hospitalized Covid-19 patients treated with or without Low Molecular Weight Heparin (LMWH) (n = 187 and 226, respectively) in the Covid Clinics of Gulhane Education and Research Hospital in Ankara, Turkey, between March 18 and May 03, 2020. The treatment groups were consisted of the patients evaluated before and after The Covid-19 Treatment Guide update on April 12, 2020 that included the anticoagulant treatment thereafter. RESULTS The mean age of all 413 patients (204 male and 209 female) at disease onset was 50.6 ± 16.7 years. The LMWH-treated patients had significantly higher coagulation markers such as d-dimer and platelet count than LMWH-untreated patients (p values < 0.05). The inflammatory markers, ferritin, interleukin-6 and procalcitonin were significantly increased in LMWH-untreated patients (p values < 0.05). The presence of any comorbidity was significantly more common in LMWH-treated patients compared to LMWH-untreated group (39.6% vs 19.9%, respectively; p < 0.001). Hypertension and diabetes mellitus were the most frequent comorbidities in both groups. The number of intensive care unit (ICU) transfer and longer length of hospital stay were more commonly observed in LMWH-untreated patients (p values <0.05). CONCLUSIONS Early anticoagulant treatment with relatively higher doses of LMWH may improve the clinical outcome of Covid-19 patients and shorten the length of hospital stay.","Arslan, Yakup; Yilmaz, Gulden; Dogan, Deniz; Hasirci, Mine; Cetindogan, Hatice; Ocal, Nesrin; Savasci, Umit; Fidan, Gonca; Tasci, Canturk",Phlebology,https://doi.org/10.1177/0268355520975595; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33243082/,175

Immunocompromised patients, older adults, and postoperative patients are at greater risk for VAP. With the dynamic changes in the empirical world, updated evidence must be used to guide the standard of practice. This literature review assimilates the recent evidence for VAP prevention. METHOD The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis framework guided the selection of the included research articles. Medline, EBSCO host, CINAHL, UpToDate and Google Scholar databases explored, for relevant publications between 2010 and 2020. The quality of evidence for the 14 studies selected were rated using the hierarchy of quantitative research designs. RESULTS Evidence-based VAP preventive strategies are prevention of aspiration, minimizing ventilator days, reducing the pathogen load, safe endotracheal suction practices, and pharmaceutical preventive measures. The mandates for VAP preventive measures among coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients is included. CONCLUSION Though some of these themes identify with the past, the nuances in their implementation are highlights of this review. The review reiterates the need to revisit ambiguous practices implemented for VAP prevention. Adherence to evidence-based practices, by education, training, and reduction of workload is the key to VAP prevention.","Isac, Chandrani; Samson, Hema Roslin; John, Anitha",Nursing forum,https://doi.org/10.1111/nuf.12621; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34091899/,175

Whereas a substantial proportion of these publications have focused on the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene, several have explored the influence of other polymorphisms. We undertook a systematic review of the impact of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in non-apolipoprotein E (non-APOE) genes associated with patient outcomes in adult TBI). We searched EMBASE, MEDLINE, CINAHL, and gray literature from inception to the beginning of August 2017 for studies of genetic variance in relation to patient outcomes in adult TBI. Sixty-eight articles were deemed eligible for inclusion into the systematic review. The SNPs described were in the following categories: neurotransmitter (NT) in 23, cytokine in nine, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in 12, mitochondrial genes in three, and miscellaneous SNPs in 21. All studies were based on small patient cohorts and suffered from potential bias. A range of SNPs associated with genes coding for monoamine NTs, BDNF, cytokines, and mitochondrial proteins have been reported to be associated with variation in global, neuropsychiatric, and behavioral outcomes. An analysis of the tissue, cellular, and subcellular location of the genes that harbored the SNPs studied showed that they could be clustered into blood-brain barrier associated, neuroprotective/regulatory, and neuropsychiatric/degenerative groups. Several small studies report that various NT, cytokine, and BDNF-related SNPs are associated with variations in global outcome at 6-12 months post-TBI. The association of these SNPs with neuropsychiatric and behavioral outcomes is less clear. A definitive assessment of role and effect size of genetic variation in these genes on outcome remains uncertain, but could be clarified by an adequately powered genome-wide association study with appropriate recording of outcomes.","Zeiler, Frederick A; McFadyen, Charles; Newcombe, Virginia F J; Synnot, Anneliese; Donoghue, Emma L; Ripatti, Samuli; Steyerberg, Ewout W; Gruen, Russel L; McAllister, Thomas W; Rosand, Jonathan; Palotie, Aarno; Maas, Andrew I R; Menon, David K",Journal of neurotrauma,https://doi.org/10.1089/neu.2017.5583; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29799308/,175

The allocation of both material and human resources to fight the pandemic cannot overshadow the care for acute stroke, a time-sensitive emergency that with an inefficient treatment will further increase mortality and long-term disability. OBJECTIVE This paper summarizes the recommendations from the Scientific Department on Cerebrovascular Diseases of the Brazilian Academy of Neurology, the Brazilian Society of Cerebrovascular Diseases and the Brazilian Society of Neuroradiology for management of acute stroke and urgent neuro-interventional procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic, including proper use of screening tools, personal protective equipment (for patients and health professionals), and patient allocation.","Mont'alverne, Francisco José Arruda; Lima, Fabrício Oliveira; Nogueira, Raul Gomes; Freitas, Carlos Clayton Macedo de; Neto, Octávio Marques Pontes; Silva, Gisele Sampaio; Oliveira, Maura Salaroli de; Frudit, Michel; Caldas, Jose Guilherme Mendes Pereira; Abud, Daniel Giansante; Conforto, Adriana Bastos; Carvalho, Fernanda Martins Maia; Dias, Francisco Antunes; Bazan, Rodrigo; Avelar, Wagner Mauad; Moro, Carla Heloísa Cabral; MagalhÃes, Pedro Silva Correa de; Miranda, Maramelia; Barbosa, Leandro de Assis",Arquivos de neuro-psiquiatria,https://doi.org/10.1590/0004-282x20200053; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32756857/,175
126361,Improving Quality of Patient Data for Treatment of Multidrug- or Rifampin-Resistant Tuberculosis.,2020-03-17,"BACKGROUND Revisional bariatric surgery (RBS) is increasing. The various primary operations with their distinctive complications make this group of patients quite heterogeneous, and treatment has to be individualized. There are concerns regarding the safety profile and efficacy of these procedures. The objective of the present study was to analyze the indications, safety, and efficacy of RBS at a high-volume Asian center and provide insight into the different treatment options. METHODS Of a total of 1578 bariatric surgeries from July 2006 to June 2012, 52 patients underwent revisional bariatric procedures. The primary operations included 6 different procedures. The indications for surgery were grouped into weight loss failure (n = 21) or complications related to the primary operation (n = 31). The revisional operations performed were conversion to another procedure (n = 22), revision of existing anatomy (n = 29), or reversal to normal anatomy (n = 1). RESULTS 96% of revisional surgeries were performed laparoscopically. The median operating time was 72 minutes (25-240 min), and the median duration of hospital stay was 4 days (3-25 d). The mean body mass index for weight loss failure decreased significantly from 36.3 to 29.6 kg/m(2) after 1 year of revisional surgery (P<.01). However, revision of RYGB was only associated with a body mass index loss of 3.2 kg/m(2) and percentage of excess weight loss of 31.8%. More than 90% of the patients with complications had complete resolution of their preoperative symptoms. There were 3 major complications with an overall morbidity rate of 5.8%. There was no mortality. CONCLUSIONS RBS is well-tolerated, with satisfactory early outcomes, in high-volume centers. However, larger studies with longer follow-up periods are needed to determine the long-term efficacy of these procedures.","Vij, Anirudh; Malapan, Kirubakaran; Tsai, Ching-Chung; Hung, Kuo-Chung; Chang, Po-Chi; Huang, Chih-Kun",Surgery for obesity and related diseases : official journal of the American Society for Bariatric Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.soard.2014.04.033; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26093768/,175

In ideal conditions of public communication, the authorities would be aligned with a totally transparent system supplying abundant information and ease of understanding to generate credibility, confidence, and partnership with the media. In the hiatuses of acceptable versions and in the midst of indeterminations, individuals become their own experts, consuming fake news and reproducing fallacious risk narratives with disastrous consequences. The article discusses various aspects of fake news and the use of communicative reason by public authorities, citing the case of Iran and drawing parallels with the antivaccination movement and its consequences. The authors address the challenge of coordinated orientation of society with information, competing with pseudo-scientific pastiches that proliferate at breakneck speed in the absence of official data. All this raises the following question: which communication models should back the official narrative to create the conditions for collaboration and partnership with the media? What impacts would such models have on the proliferation of misleading narratives that citizens turn to during crises of appropriate orientation? The authors conclude that it is also the government's role to use its broad visibility to create references of safety under the primacy of communicative reason, sensitive to society's genuine questions and concerns. In short, government should produce responsible references on a monumental scale, oriented by the ethics of accountability in line with the common good.","Vasconcellos-Silva, Paulo R; Castiel, Luis David",Cadernos de saude publica,https://doi.org/10.1590/0102-311x00101920; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32725084/,175

127487,"Age-related increases in PGD(2) expression impair respiratory DC migration, resulting in diminished T cell responses upon respiratory virus infection in mice.",2011,"For the hemispheric laterality of emotion processing in the brain, two competing hypotheses are currently still debated. The first hypothesis suggests a greater involvement of the right hemisphere in emotion perception whereas the second hypothesis suggests different involvements of each hemisphere as a function of the valence of the emotion. These hypotheses are based on findings for facial and prosodic emotion perception. Investigating emotion perception for other stimuli, such as music, should provide further insight and potentially help to disentangle between these two hypotheses. The present study investigated musical emotion perception in patients with unilateral right brain damage (RBD, n = 16) or left brain damage (LBD, n = 16), as well as in matched healthy comparison participants (n = 28). The experimental task required explicit recognition of musical emotions as well as ratings on the perceived intensity of the emotion. Compared to matched comparison participants, musical emotion recognition was impaired only in LBD participants, suggesting a potential specificity of the left hemisphere for explicit emotion recognition in musical material. In contrast, intensity ratings of musical emotions revealed that RBD patients underestimated the intensity of negative emotions compared to positive emotions, while LBD patients and comparisons did not show this pattern. To control for a potential generalized emotion deficit for other types of stimuli, we also tested facial emotion recognition in the same patients and their matched healthy comparisons. This revealed that emotion recognition after brain damage might depend on the stimulus category or modality used. These results are in line with the hypothesis of a deficit of emotion perception depending on lesion laterality and valence in brain-damaged participants. The present findings provide critical information to disentangle the currently debated competing hypotheses and thus allow for a better characterization of the involvement of each hemisphere for explicit emotion recognition and their perceived intensity.","Pralus, Agathe; Belfi, Amy; Hirel, Catherine; Lévêque, Yohana; Fornoni, Lesly; Bigand, Emmanuel; Jung, Julien; Tranel, Daniel; Nighoghossian, Norbert; Tillmann, Barbara; Caclin, Anne",Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cortex.2020.05.015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32645502/,175

BACKGROUND Nurses working in shifts are vulnerable to sleep disturbances. However, little is known about the influence of rotating day and night shift schedules and healthy lifestyle on nurses' daily sleep patterns. DESIGN Descriptive correlational design. METHODS Thirty-two hospital nurses working in shifts and 32 hospital nurses not working in shifts participated in data collection. Their sleep patterns were measured for six consecutive days using Fitbit Charge 3™ , and information on alcohol consumption, exercise, and eating habits were assessed using a questionnaire. Data were analysed using repeated measures analysis of variance with post hoc Scheffe's test and hierarchical multiple regression analysis. The study was conducted in accordance with the STROBE guideline. RESULTS Overall, nurses working on rotating day and night shifts had significantly shorter total sleep time, longer sleep onset latency, and lower sleep efficiency than those not working in shifts. In particular, nurses working for 3 or 4 consecutive night shifts had significantly shorter total sleep time, lower sleep efficiency and longer sleep onset latency than those working for 0-2 consecutive night shifts. Rotating day and night shifts and alcohol consumption significantly influenced sleep efficiency. CONCLUSIONS A work schedule of ≥3 consecutive night shifts and the habit of alcohol consumption before bed time influence nurses' sleep efficiency.

STUDY DESIGN Retrospective case series. ANIMALS Nine dogs with arterial hemorrhage during TPLO. METHODS Medical records of dogs with hemorrhage controlled through the osteotomy gap of a TPLO were reviewed at 2 institutions over 8 years. Inclusion criteria included diagnosis of single cranial cruciate ligament rupture, intraoperative arterial hemorrhage during the radial osteotomy controlled with bipolar electrocautery or hemostatic clips placed along the cranial tibial artery through the osteotomy, complete medical records, radiographic follow-up for at least 8 weeks postoperatively, and completion of long-term follow-up questionnaire by the owner. RESULTS Dogs were 4.6 ± 1.8 years old and weighed 36.6 ± 9.7 kg. In total, 3 ± 1 hemostatic clips were placed per stifle. Intraoperative hemostasis was achieved in all cases. One of the first dogs received a blood transfusion during the procedure and had a postoperative packed cell volume of 37%. The only complication consisted of fibular fracture, which was noticed on radiographs of 1 dog 8 weeks after TPLO.

To date, the suture pullout strength in the IGHL is not well-documented. This may contribute to recurrent instability. Purpose/Hypothesis A cadaveric biomechanical study was designed to investigate the suture pullout strength of sutures in the IGHL. We hypothesized that there would be no significant variability of suture pullout strength between specimens and zones. Additionally, we sought to determine the impact of early mobilization on sutures in the IGHL at time zero. We hypothesized that capsular plication sutures would fail under low load. Study Design Descriptive laboratory study. Methods Seven fresh-frozen cadaveric shoulders were dissected to isolate the IGHL complex, which was then divided into 18 zones. Sutures in these zones were attached to a linear actuator, and the resistance to suture pullout was recorded. A suture pullout strength map of the IGHL was constructed. These loads were used to calculate the load applied at the hand that would initiate suture pullout in the IGHL. Results Mean suture pullout strength for all specimens was 61.6 ± 26.1 N. The maximum load found to cause suture pullout through tissue was found to be low, regardless of zone of the IGHL. Calculations suggest that an external rotation force applied to the hand of only 9.6 N may be sufficient to tear capsular sutures at time zero. Conclusion This study did not provide clear evidence of desirable locations for fixation in the IGHL. However, given the low magnitude of failure loads, the results suggest the timetable for initiation of range-of-motion exercises should be reconsidered to prevent suture pullout through the IGHL. Clinical Relevance From this biomechanical study, the magnitude of force required to cause suture pullout through the IGHL is met or surpassed by normal postoperative early range-of-motion protocols.","Raniga, Sumit; Cadman, Joseph; Dabirrahmani, Danè; Bui, David; Appleyard, Richard; Bokor, Desmond",Orthopaedic journal of sports medicine,https://doi.org/10.1177/2325967120969640; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33490294/,175

However, it remains unclear whether patients who do not show overt seizure behavior develop neurological consequences. Therefore, this study compared two subpopulations of rats with a low versus high seizure response to diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP) to evaluate whether acute OP intoxication causes persistent neuropathology in non-seizing individuals. Adult male Sprague Dawley rats administered DFP (4 mg/kg, sc), atropine sulfate (2 mg/kg, im), and pralidoxime (25 mg/kg, im) were monitored for seizure activity for 4 h post-exposure. Animals were separated into groups with low versus high seizure response based on behavioral criteria and electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings. Cholinesterase activity was evaluated by Ellman assay, and neuropathology was evaluated at 1, 2, 4, and 60 days post-exposure by Fluoro-Jade C (FJC) staining and micro-CT imaging. DFP significantly inhibited cholinesterase activity in the cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala to the same extent in low and high responders. FJC staining revealed significant neurodegeneration in DFP low responders albeit this response was delayed, less persistent, and decreased in magnitude compared to DFP high responders.

131243,Characterization in mice of the stromal niche maintaining AT2 stem cell proliferation in homeostasis and disease.,2021-05-28,"BACKGROUND Post-operative acute kidney injury after cardiopulmonary bypass (AKI-CPB) for cardiac surgery is a frequent complication. It may require renal replacement therapy (RRT), which is associated with an increased morbidity and mortality. This review explores the efficacy of proposed pharmacological and non-surgical renal protective strategies. METHODS A comprehensive literature search was done using Ovid MEDLINE, Embase and Scopus databases. Keywords included were cardiopulmonary bypass, cardiac surgery, coronary artery bypass, renal protection and renal preservation. Eligible articles consisted of all studies on patients who had undergone cardiac surgery via CPB with an outcome of AKI and/or RRT reported. All studies underwent a quality check via the risk of bias tool. The three most researched interventions (based on number of randomized controlled trials and total patients analysed) and their renal outcomes were then analysed with Review Manager Software. RESULTS Eighty-eight articles were extracted. A total of 26 management strategies for renal protection following CPB were identified. N-acetylcysteine (NAC), remote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC) and the use of volatile anaesthetic agents (VAAs) were further analysed. NAC, RIPC and VAA had no statistically significant benefit in reducing either AKI-CPB or the need for RRT following CPB. CONCLUSION NAC, RIPC and VAA were found to have no statistical significant benefit in reducing either AKI-CPB or the need for RRT following CPB. There remains clinical uncertainty with all currently proposed pharmacological and non-surgical renal protective strategies for CPB. Future research in this area should analyse the effects of combined interventions or specifically focus on 'at-risk' patients.","Tan, Shijie Ian; Brewster, David J; Horrigan, Diane; Sarode, Vineet",ANZ journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1111/ans.14800; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30239089/,175

Materials & methods: Two artificial neural network (ANN) algorithms were adopted: a multilayer feed-forward network (MLFFNN) and a nonlinear autoregressive network with eXogenous inputs (NARX). Data on the incidence of the four most common tumors (breast, colorectal, lung and prostate) from 1992 to 2016 (available from National Cancer Institute online datasets) were used for training and validation, and data until 2050 were predicted. Results: The rapid decreasing trend of prostate cancer incidence started in 2010 will continue until 2018-2019; it will then slow down and reach a plateau after 2050, with several differences among ethnicities. The incidence of breast cancer will reach a plateau in 2030, whereas colorectal cancer incidence will reach a minimum value of 35 per 100,000 in 2030. As for lung cancer, the incidence will decrease from 50 per 100,000 (2017) to 31 per 100,000 in 2030 and 26 per 100,000 in 2050.

133207,Respiratory Infections in the U.S. Military: Recent Experience and Control.,2015,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Preoperative embolization for intracranial meningiomas offers potential advantages for safer and more effective surgery. However, this treatment strategy has not been examined in a large comparative series. The purpose of this study was to review our experience using preoperative embolization to understand the efficacy, technical considerations and complications of this technique. MATERIALS AND METHODS We performed a retrospective review of patients undergoing intracranial meningioma resection at our institution (March 2001 to December 2012). Comparisons were made between embolized and nonembolized patients, including patient and tumor characteristics, embolization method, operative blood loss, complications, and extent of resection. Logistic regression analyses were used to identify factors predictive of operative blood loss and extent of resection. RESULTS Preoperatively, 224 patients were referred for embolization, of which 177 received embolization. No complications were seen in 97.1%. There were no significant differences in operative duration, extent of resection, or complications. Estimated blood loss was higher in the embolized group (410 versus 315 mL, P=.0074), but history of embolization was not a predictor of blood loss in multivariate analysis. Independent predictors of blood loss included decreasing degree of tumor embolization (P=.037), skull base location (P=.005), and male sex (P=.034). Embolization was not an independent predictor of gross total resection. CONCLUSIONS Preoperative embolization is a safe option for selected meningiomas. In our series, embolization did not alter the operative duration, complications, or degree of resection, but the degree of embolization was an independent predictor of decreased operative blood loss.","Raper, D M S; Starke, R M; Henderson, F; Ding, D; Simon, S; Evans, A J; Jane, J A; Liu, K C",AJNR.

We explored a new mathematical approach based on game theory, the so-called multi-perturbation Shapley value analysis (MSA), to assess causal function localizations and interactions from multiple perturbation data. We applied MSA to a dataset composed of lesion patterns of 148 acute stroke patients and their National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores, to systematically investigate the influence of different parameter settings on the outcomes of the approach. Specifically, we investigated aspects of MSA methodology including the choice of the predictor algorithm (typology and kernel functions), training dataset (original versus binary), as well as the influence of lesion thresholds. We assessed the suitability of MSA for processing real clinical lesion data and established the central parameters for this analysis. RESULTS We derived general recommendations for the analysis of clinical datasets by MSA and showed that, for the studied dataset, the best approach was to use a linear-kernel support vector machine predictor, trained with a binary training dataset, where the binarization was implemented through a median threshold of lesion size for each region. We demonstrated that the results obtained with different MSA variants lead to almost identical results as the basic MSA. CONCLUSIONS MSA is a feasible approach for the multivariate lesion analysis of clinical stroke data. Informed choices need to be made to set parameters that may affect the analysis outcome.","Zavaglia, Melissa; Forkert, Nils D; Cheng, Bastian; Gerloff, Christian; Thomalla, Götz; Hilgetag, Claus C",BMC neuroscience,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12868-016-0275-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27349961/,175

Nurses are the foundation of any healthcare system. Today, many of them are on the front line in the fight against COVID-19. Without nurses and other health professionals, the world will not win the fight against epidemics or pandemics or achieve the health potential of populations. AIM The main purpose of this article is to draw attention to the heroic work of nurses and the role they have to fulfil in society. Their daily work, hardship and courage can be called heroism, especially when in times of epidemics or pandemics they risk their own lives to care for and support those most in need.

135180,Outbreak of canine norovirus infection in young dogs.,2010,"The roof and spire of Notre-Dame cathedral in Paris that caught fire and collapsed on 15 April 2019 were covered with 460 t of lead (Pb). Government reports documented Pb deposition immediately downwind of the cathedral and a twentyfold increase in airborne Pb concentrations at a distance of 50 km in the aftermath. For this study, we collected 100 samples of surface soil from tree pits, parks, and other sites in all directions within 1 km of the cathedral. Concentrations of Pb measured by X-ray fluorescence range from 30 to 9,000 mg/kg across the area, with a higher proportion of elevated concentrations to the northwest of the cathedral, in the direction of the wind prevailing during the fire. By integrating these observations with a Gaussian process regression model, we estimate that the average concentration of Pb in surface soil downwind of the cathedral is 430 (95% interval, 300-590) mg/kg, nearly double the average Pb concentration in the other directions of 240 (95% interval, 170-320) mg/kg. The difference corresponds to an integrated excess Pb inventory within a 1 km radius of 1.0 (95% interval, 0.5-1.5) t, about 0.2% of all the Pb covering the roof and spire. This is over 6 times the estimated amount of Pb deposited downwind 1-50 km from the cathedral. To what extent the concentrated fallout within 1 km documented here temporarily exposed the downwind population to Pb is difficult to confirm independently because too few soil, dust, and blood samples were collected immediately after the fire.","van Geen, Alexander; Yao, Yuling; Ellis, Tyler; Gelman, Andrew",GeoHealth,https://doi.org/10.1029/2020gh000279; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33855247/,175

Improvement of this molecular description is highly desirable for in silico drug discovery and medicinal chemistry applications. In this work, we revised a well-established molecular mechanics' force field and applied a hybrid quantum mechanics and machine learning approach to parametrize the hydrogen-bonding (HB) potentials of small molecules, improving this aspect of the molecular description. Approximately 66,000 molecules were chosen from available drug databases and subjected to density functional theory calculations (DFT). For each atom, the molecular electrostatic potential (EP) was extracted and used to derive new HB energy contributions; this was subsequently combined with a fingerprint-based description of the structural environment via partial least squares modeling, enabling the new potentials to be used for molecules outside of the training set. We demonstrate that parameter prediction for molecules outside of the training set correlates with their DFT-derived EP, and that there is correlation of the new potentials with hydrogen-bond acidity and basicity scales. We show the newly derived MIFs vary in strength for various ring substitution in accordance with chemical intuition. Finally, we report that this derived parameter, when extended to non-HB atoms, can also be used to estimate sites of reaction.","Tortorella, Sara; Carosati, Emanuele; Sorbi, Giulia; Bocci, Giovanni; Cross, Simon; Cruciani, Gabriele; Storchi, Loriano",Journal of computational chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1002/jcc.26737; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34410004/,175

Traditional Chinese medicine involves the treatment of disease from an overall perspective, and its therapeutic effects on CVD have been demonstrated. However, the mechanisms contributing to the multiscale treatment of cardiovascular diseases at the systematic level remain unclear. Network pharmacology methods and a gene chip data analysis were integrated and applied in the present study, which was conducted to investigate the potential target genes and related pathways of Shenfu Decoction (SFD) for the treatment of myocardial injury. The gene chip analysis was initially performed, followed by network pharmacology to identify differentially expressed genes (DEG) and a functional enrichment analysis. Protein-protein networks were constructed and a module analysis was conducted. A network analysis was used to identify the target genes of SFD. Regarding the results obtained, 1134 DEG were identified using the STRING website. The module analysis revealed that nine hub genes exhibited ubiquitin-protein ligase activity. Therefore, SFD significantly alters the expression of ubiquitination-related genes and, thus, plays an important therapeutic role in the treatment of heart failure.

During the time period 2016-2017, altogether 75 respiratory samples from children hospitalized with acute respiratory infection were collected. The samples were first screened for RSV by direct immunofluorescence method and then subjected to detect HBoV DNA by PCR. Genotyping of HBoV-positive samples was conducted by direct sequencing of PCR products using NP and VP1/VP2 genes. Out of 75 respiratory samples, 20 (26.7%) and 10 (13.3%) were positive for RSV and HBoV, respectively. The coinfection rate was 40% (p = 0.048). Considering the seasonal distribution, winter has the highest extent outbreak (p = 0.036). Sequence analysis of positive samples exhibits that all of the isolated HBoV were related to genotype 1 (HBoV-1) with minimal sequence variations. Increasing frequency of HBoV suggests that the virus is related to acute respiratory infection in children.

It is often assumed that this arises solely from the feed-forward encoding of the strength or precision of sensory inputs. In contrast, interoceptive inference models suggest that confidence reflects a weighted integration of sensory precision and expectations about internal states, such as arousal. Here we test this hypothesis using a novel psychophysical paradigm, in which unseen disgust-cues induced unexpected, unconscious arousal just before participants discriminated motion signals of variable precision. Across measures of perceptual bias, uncertainty, and physiological arousal we found that arousing disgust cues modulated the encoding of sensory noise. Furthermore, the degree to which trial-by-trial pupil fluctuations encoded this nonlinear interaction correlated with trial level confidence. Our results suggest that unexpected arousal regulates perceptual precision, such that subjective confidence reflects the integration of both external sensory and internal, embodied states.","Allen, Micah; Frank, Darya; Schwarzkopf, D Samuel; Fardo, Francesca; Winston, Joel S; Hauser, Tobias U; Rees, Geraint",eLife,https://doi.org/10.7554/elife.18103; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27776633/,175

High uptake of 123I-meta-iodobenzylguanidine is dependent on high expression of vesicular monoamine transporters responsible for mediating uptake of biogenic amines into dense core granules. A patient with metastatic paraganglioma (liver and bone metastases) underwent surgical removal of the primary after injection of 131I-meta-iodobenzylguanidine and 111In-octreotide. Radioactivity was determined in biopsies from tumor and normal tissue biopsies. The tumor/blood concentration value was high: 180 for 131I-meta-iodobenzylguanidine 3 h after injection and 590 for 111In-octreotide 27 h after injection. Studies of primary tumor cell cultures demonstrated increased cell membrane binding and internalization over time for 131I-meta-iodobenzylguanidine. The vesicular monoamine transporter antagonist reserpine and the norepinephrine transporter inhibitor clomipramine reduced internalization by 90% and 70%, respectively, after 46 h of incubation. The results demonstrated increased cell membrane binding and internalization over time also for 111In-octreotide. Internalization was highest for a low concentration of 111In-octreotide. Excess of octreotide reduced internalization of 111In-octreotide with 75% after 46 h of incubation. In conclusion, uptake and tumor/blood concentration values of radiolabeled meta-iodobenzylguanidine and somatostatin analogues can be determined for metastatic pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma to evaluate the possibility to use one or both agents for therapy. For this patient, the high tumor/blood values clearly demonstrated that therapy using both radiopharmaceuticals would be most beneficial.

141862,"Saffold virus infection in children, Malaysia, 2009.",2011,"BACKGROUND Anosmia and ageusia are symptoms commonly associated with COVID-19, but the relationship with disease severity, onset and recovery are unclear. OBJECTIVE To examine factors associated with anosmia and ageusia and the recovery from these symptoms in an ethnically diverse cohort. METHODS Individuals tested for SARS-CoV-2 between March and April 2020 were eligible for the study. Randomly selected participants answered a telephone questionnaire on COVID-19 symptoms with a focus on anosmia and ageusia. Additionally, relevant past medical history and data on the COVID-19 clinical course were obtained from electronic medical records. 486 patients were in the COVID-19 group and 103 were COVID-19-negative. RESULTS Patients who were younger were more likely to report anosmia and/or ageusia (odds ratio (OR) for anosmia per 1-year increase in age: 0·98, 95%CI:0-97-0·99, p = 0·003; for ageusia: 0·98, 95%CI:0·97-0·99, p = 0·005) as were patients with lower eosinophil counts (OR for anosmia per 0.1-K/μL increase in eosinophils: 0·02, 95%CI:0·001-0·46, p = 0·01, for ageusia 0·10, 95%CI:0·01-0·97, p = 0·047). Male gender was independently associated with a lower probability of ageusia (OR:0·56, 95%CI:0·38-0·82, p = 0·003) and earlier sense of taste recovery (HR:1·44, 95%CI:1·05-1·98, p = 0·02). Latinos showed earlier sense of taste recovery than white patients (HR:1·82, 95%CI:1·05-3·18, p = 0·03). CONCLUSION Anosmia and ageusia were more common among younger patients and those with lower blood eosinophil counts. Ageusia was less commonly reported among men, and time to taste recovery was earlier among both men and Latinos.","Sehanobish, Esha; Barbi, Mali; Fong, Valerie; Kravitz, Meryl; Sanchez Tejera, Denise; Asad, Mohammad; Matsumura, Cynthia; Ferastraoaru, Denisa; O'Neill, Meaghan; Karagic, Merhunisa; Akbar, Nadeem; Bottalico, Danielle M; Patel, Viraj; Peshansky, Alexandre; Rangareddy, Mahendra; Hudes, Golda; Kim, Mimi; Eisenberg, Ruth; Nath, Avindra; Smith, Bryan R; Ow, Thomas J; Jerschow, Elina",American journal of rhinology & allergy,https://doi.org/10.1177/19458924211004800; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33813917/,175
141867,"hvTRA, a novel TRAIL receptor agonist, induces apoptosis and sustained growth retardation in melanoma.",2016,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is the most common viral cause of congenital infection, occurring in approximately 1-2% of live births worldwide. Given our increasing knowledge of risk, advances in the identification of maternal infection, and the extremely limited options for the treatment of fetal infection, the prevention is a promising direction for research efforts. Recently, there have been several exciting studies assessing different ways of preventing congenital infection in the fetus and one in particular has focused on the use of valaciclovir. RECENT FINDINGS A recent study reported a 71% reduction in vertical transmission of CMV with the use of oral valaciclovir following maternal primary CMV infection early in pregnancy. The clinical impact of this study could be enormous and it has particular implications for considerations around maternal serological screening in the first trimester of pregnancy. Further research assessing behaviour modifications during early pregnancy could also provide evidence for an effective primary prevention technique. SUMMARY Prevention of congenital CMV infection, whether primary, secondary or tertiary, is possible, however, there are barriers to its utilisation in a clinical setting. The main limitation is the requirement for early, effective and large-scale serological screening of mothers to detect asymptomatic primary infection.","Tol, Isabel; Heath, Paul T; Khalil, Asma",Current opinion in infectious diseases,https://doi.org/10.1097/qco.0000000000000777; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34334662/,175

The objective was to develop an assessment tool for video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) lobectomy by achieving consensus within an international group of VATS experts. METHOD The Delphi method was used as a structured process for collecting and distilling knowledge from a group of internationally recognized VATS experts. Opinions were obtained in an iterative process involving answering repeated rounds of questionnaires. Responses to one round were summarized and integrated into the next round of questionnaires until consensus was reached. RESULTS Thirty-one VATS experts were included and four Delphi rounds were conducted. The response rate for each round were 68.9% (31/45), 100% (31/31), 96.8% (30/31), and 93.3% (28/30) for the final round where consensus was reached. The first Delphi round contained 44 items and the final VATS lobectomy Assessment Tool (VATSAT) comprised eight items with rating anchors: (1) localization of tumor and other pathological tissue, (2) dissection of the hilum and veins, (3) dissection of the arteries, (4) dissection of the bronchus, (5) dissection of lymph nodes, (6) retrieval of lobe in bag, (7) respect for tissue and structures, and (8) technical skills in general. CONCLUSION A novel and dedicated assessment tool for VATS lobectomy was developed based on VATS experts' consensus. The VATSAT can support the learning of VATS lobectomy by providing structured feedback and help supervisors make the important decision of when trainees have acquired VATS lobectomy competencies for independent performance.","Jensen, Katrine; Petersen, René Horsleben; Hansen, Henrik Jessen; Walker, William; Pedersen, Jesper Holst; Konge, Lars",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-018-6162-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29603007/,175

142362,Characterization of a Vesivirus Associated with an Outbreak of Acute Hemorrhagic Gastroenteritis in Domestic Dogs.,2018,"In situ analysis of biomarkers is highly desirable in molecular pathology because it allows the examination of biomarker status within the histopathological context of clinical specimens. Immunohistochemistry and DNA in situ hybridization (ISH) are widely used in clinical settings to assess protein and DNA biomarkers, respectively, but clinical use of in situ RNA analysis is rare. This disparity is especially notable when considering the abundance of RNA biomarkers discovered through whole-genome expression profiling. This is largely due to the high degree of technical complexity and insufficient sensitivity and specificity of current RNA ISH techniques. Here, we describe RNAscope, a novel RNA ISH technology with a unique probe design strategy that allows simultaneous signal amplification and background suppression to achieve single-molecule visualization while preserving tissue morphology. RNAscope is compatible with routine formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue specimens and can use either conventional chromogenic dyes for bright-field microscopy or fluorescent dyes for multiplex analysis. Unlike grind-and-bind RNA analysis methods such as real-time RT-PCR, RNAscope brings the benefits of in situ analysis to RNA biomarkers and may enable rapid development of RNA ISH-based molecular diagnostic assays.","Wang, Fay; Flanagan, John; Su, Nan; Wang, Li-Chong; Bui, Son; Nielson, Allissa; Wu, Xingyong; Vo, Hong-Thuy; Ma, Xiao-Jun; Luo, Yuling",The Journal of molecular diagnostics : JMD,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmoldx.2011.08.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22166544/,175

142663,Patient Report and Review of Rapidly Growing Mycobacterial Infection after Cardiac Device Implantation.,2016,"Guanine-rich DNA and RNA sequences can fold into noncanonical nucleic acid structures called G-quadruplexes (G4s). Since the discovery that these structures may act as scaffolds for the binding of specific ligands, G4s aroused the attention of a growing number of scientists. The versatile roles of G4 structures in viral replication, transcription, and translation suggest direct applications in therapy or diagnostics. G4-interacting molecules (proteins or small molecules) may also affect the balance between latent and lytic phases, and increasing evidence reveals that G4s are implicated in generally suppressing viral processes, such as replication, transcription, translation, or reverse transcription. In this review, we focus on the discovery of G4s in viruses and the role of G4 ligands in the antiviral drug discovery process. After assessing the role of viral G4s, we argue that host G4s participate in immune modulation, viral tumorigenesis, cellular pathways involved in virus maturation, and DNA integration of viral genomes, which can be potentially employed for antiviral therapeutics. Furthermore, we scrutinize the impediments and shortcomings in the process of studying G4 ligands and drug discovery. Finally, some unanswered questions regarding viral G4s are highlighted for prospective future projects. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: G-quadruplexes (G4s) are noncanonical nucleic acid structures that have gained increasing recognition during the last few decades. First identified as relevant targets in oncology, their importance in virology is now increasingly clear. A number of G-quadruplex ligands are known: viral transcription and replication are the main targets of these ligands. Both viral and cellular G4s may be targeted; this review embraces the different aspects of G-quadruplexes in both host and viral contexts.","Abiri, Ardavan; Lavigne, Marc; Rezaei, Masoud; Nikzad, Sanaz; Zare, Peyman; Mergny, Jean-Louis; Rahimi, Hamid-Reza",Pharmacological reviews,https://doi.org/10.1124/pharmrev.120.000230; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34045305/,175

The attached one-way valve allowed unrestrained inspiration through the tracheal tube but prevented physiological expiration. The increased pulmonary pressure resulted in alveolar rupture and replaced expiration with a steady release of air into the peribronchial sheaths and the mediastinum, resulting in what is commonly known as the Macklin effect. From the mediastinum, air inflated both pleural cavities, the peritoneum, and the subcutaneous tissue of the entire body. No gas was found in the blood vessels, the brain, the bones, or in the inner organs. The entire air volume was estimated by radiological segmentation to be more than 25 l. This implies continuous inspiration, while expiration turned into an aberrant pulmonary decompression by whole-body gas-enclosure.

144027,"Virucidal activity of WHO-recommended formulations against enveloped viruses including Zika, Ebola and emerging Coronaviruses.",2017,"BACKGROUND The relative importance of different routes of influenza transmission, including the role of bioaerosols, and ability of masks and/or hand hygiene to prevent transmission, remains poorly understood. Current evidence suggests that infectious virus is not typically released from adults after 5 days of illness, however, little is known about the extent to which virus is deposited by infected individuals into the environment and whether deposited virus has the ability to infect new hosts. Further information about the deposition of viable influenza virus in the immediate vicinity of patients with pandemic influenza is fundamental to our understanding of the routes and mechanisms of transmission. OBJECTIVES To collect data on patients infected with pandemic H1N1 2009 (swine flu). Primary objectives were to correlate the amount of virus detected in a patient's nose with that recovered from his/her immediate environment, and with symptom duration and severity. Secondary objectives were to describe virus shedding and duration according to major patient characteristics: adults versus children, and those with mild illness (community patients) versus those with more severe disease (hospitalised patients). METHODS Adults and children, both in hospital and from the community, who had symptoms of pandemic H1N1 infection, were enrolled and visited every day during follow-up for a maximum of 12 days. Symptom data was collected and samples were taken, including nose swabs and swabs from surfaces and objects around patients. Samples of air were obtained using validated sampling equipment. The samples were tested for the presence of pandemic H1N1 virus, using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect virus genome and an immunofluorescence technique to detect viable virus. RESULTS Forty-three subjects were followed up, and 19 of them were subsequently proven to be infected with pandemic H1N1 virus. The median duration of virus shedding from the 19 infected cases was 6 days when detection was performed by PCR, and 3 days when detection was performed by a culture technique. Over 30% of cases remained potentially infectious for at least 5 days. Only 0.5% of all community and none of the hospital swabs taken revealed virus on surfaces. Five subjects had samples of the air around them collected and virus was detected by PCR from four; some of the air particles in which virus was detected were small enough to be inhaled and deposited deep in the lungs. LIMITATION Small number of subjects recruited. CONCLUSIONS The finding that over 30% of infected individuals have infectious virus in their noses for 5 days or more has infection control implications. The data suggest that contact transmission of pandemic influenza via fomites may be less important than previously thought, but transmission via bioaerosols at short range may be possible, meaning that high-level personal protective equipment may be needed by health-care workers when attending patients with pandemic influenza. Further work is being undertaken to consolidate these findings, as they have important potential implications for the protection of health-care workers and the formulation of advice to households, nationally and internationally.","Killingley, B; Greatorex, J; Cauchemez, S; Enstone, J E; Curran, M; Read, R C; Lim, W S; Hayward, A; Nicholson, K G; Nguyen-Van-Tam, J S",Health technology assessment,https://doi.org/10.3310/hta14460-04; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20923613/,175

If not controlled, this ongoing pandemic can cause irreparable socio-economic and psychological impact worldwide. Therefore a safe and effective vaccine against COVID 19 is exigent. Recent advances in immunoinformatics approaches could potentially decline the attrition rate and accelerate the process of vaccine development in these unprecedented times. In the present study, a multivalent subunit vaccine targeting S2 subunit of the SARS-CoV2 S glycoprotein has been designed using open source, immunoinformatics tools. Designed construct comprises of epitopes capable of inducing T cell, B cell (Linear and discontinuous) and Interferon γ. physiologically, vaccine construct is predicted to be thermostable, antigenic, immunogenic, non allergen and non toxic in nature. According to population coverage analysis, designed multiepitope vaccine covers 99.26% population globally. 3D structure of vaccine construct was designed, validated and refined to obtain high quality structure. Refined structure was docked against Toll like receptors to confirm the interactions between them. Vaccine peptide sequence was reverse transcribed, codon optimized and cloned in pET vector. Our in-silico study suggests that proposed vaccine against fusion domain of virus has the potential to elicit an innate as well as humoral immune response in human and restrict the entry of virus inside the cell.

Awake prone positioning (PP) is reported to improve oxygenation and is a relatively safe modality. We performed a systematic review of the literature to evaluate the available evidence and performed meta-analysis of the effect of awake PP in non-intubated patients on improvement in oxygenation and reducing the need for intubation. We searched the PubMed and EMBASE databases to identify studies using awake PP as a therapeutic strategy in the management of COVID-19. Studies were included if they reported respiratory outcomes and included five or more subjects. The quality of individual studies was assessed by the Qualsyst tool. A meta-analysis was performed to estimate the proportion of patients requiring intubation. The degree of improvement in oxygenation parameters (PaO2: FiO2 or PaO2 or SpO2) was also calculated. Sixteen studies (seven prospective trials, three before-after studies, six retrospective series) were selected for review. The pooled proportion of patients who required mechanical ventilation was 0.25 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.16-0.34). There was a significant improvement in PaO2: FiO2 ratio, PaO2, and SpO2 during awake PP. To conclude, there is limited evidence to support the efficacy of awake PP for the management of hypoxemia in COVID-19. Further RCTs are required to study the impact of awake PP on key parameters like avoidance of mechanical ventilation, length of stay, and mortality.","Pb, Sryma; Mittal, Saurabh; Madan, Karan; Mohan, Anant; Tiwari, Pawan; Hadda, Vijay; Pandey, Ravindra Mohan; Guleria, Randeep",Monaldi archives for chest disease = Archivio Monaldi per le malattie del torace,https://doi.org/10.4081/monaldi.2021.1623; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33926179/,175

147536,Target-dependent B7-H1 regulation contributes to clearance of central nervous system infection and dampens morbidity.,2009,"CONTEXT Necrotizing fasciitis is an aggressive infection affecting the skin and soft tissue. It has a very high acute mortality. The long-term survival and cause of death of patients who survive an index hospitalization for necrotizing fasciitis are not known. OBJECTIVE To define the long-term survival of patients who survive an index admission for necrotizing fasciitis. We hypothesize that survivors will have a shorter life span than population controls. DESIGN Long-term follow-up of a registry of patients from 1989 to 2006 who survived a hospitalization for necrotizing fasciitis. Last date of follow-up was January 1, 2008. SETTINGS A university-based Burn and Trauma Center. PATIENTS A prospective registry of patients with necrotizing fasciitis has been collected from 1989 to 2006. This registry was linked to data from the Department of Health, Department of Motor Vehicles, and the University Hospital Medical Records Department in January 2008 to obtain follow-up and vital status data. INTERVENTION None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Date and cause of death were abstracted from death certificates. Date of last live follow-up was determined from the medical record and by the last driver's license renewal. The death rate of the cohort was standardized for age and sex against 2005 statewide mortality rates. Cause of death was collated into infectious and noninfectious and compared with the statewide causes of death. Statistical analysis included standardized mortality rates, Kaplan-Meier survival curves, and Aalen's additive hazard model. RESULTS Three hundred forty-five patients of the 377 in the registry survived at least 30 days and were analyzed. Average age at presentation was 49 years (range, 1-86; median, 49). Patients were followed up an average of 3.3 years (range, 0.0-15.7; median, 2.4). Eighty-seven of these patients died (25%). Median survival was 10.0 years (95% confidence interval: 7.25-13.11). There was a trend toward higher mortality in women. Twelve of the 87 deaths were due to infectious causes. Using three different statistical analytic techniques, there was a statistically significant increase in the long-term death rate when compared with population-based controls. Infectious causes of death were statistically higher than controls as well. CONCLUSIONS Patients who survive an episode of necrotizing fasciitis are at continued risk for premature death; many of these deaths were due to infectious causes such as pneumonia, cholecystitis, urinary tract infections, and sepsis. These patients should be counseled, followed, and immunized to minimize chances of death. Modification of other risk factors for death such as obesity, diabetes, smoking, and atherosclerotic disease should also be undertaken. The sex difference in long-term survival is intriguing and needs to be addressed in further studies.","Light, Timothy D; Choi, Kent C; Thomsen, Timothy A; Skeete, Dionne A; Latenser, Barbara A; Born, Janelle M; Lewis, Robert W; Wibbenmeyer, Lucy A; Shyamalkumar, Nariankadu D; Lynch, Charles F; Kealey, Gerald P",Journal of burn care & research : official publication of the American Burn Association,https://doi.org/10.1097/bcr.0b013e3181cb8cea; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20061842/,175
147825,Complement inhibition does not impair the clinical antiviral capabilities of virus-specific T-cell therapy.,2020-07-28,"OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS Bleeding during endoscopic sinus surgery and open surgeries can easily obstruct the surgeons' field of view and increase morbidity and risk of intraoperative complications. Intraoperative bleeding could potentially be addressed by a hemostatic agent that safely disperses itself through the escaping blood. We tested the safety and efficacy of a self-propelling formulation of thrombin and tranexamic acid (SPTT) in stopping bleeding in a paranasal sinus injury and in an open surgical carotid injury sheep model. STUDY DESIGN Interventional animal study. METHODS SPTT was tested in the sinonasal space following endoscopic injury to the inferior turbinate of six sheep, and to the common carotid artery following open surgical injury in eight sheep. In the nasal cavity, bleeding time and local inflammation were measured and compared to plain gauze. Following carotid arteriotomy, successful hemostasis and markers of thrombosis and coagulopathy were compared to Floseal. RESULTS SPTT significantly decreased bleeding times in the sinonasal space compared to plain gauze (mean difference = 3.8 minutes, P = .002). All of the carotid bleeds (100%) were successfully controlled with SPTT after 10 minutes of application under pressure, compared to 25% with Floseal. No adverse events were noted, and there was no evidence of thromboembolism. CONCLUSIONS SPTT significantly reduced bleeding time in a sheep model of surgical sinus bleeding and successfully stopped bleeding following catastrophic carotid artery injury, with no adverse events observed.

148389,Diagnostic Performance of Multiplex Nucleic Acid Testing of Bronchoalveolar Lavage and Bronchial Wash Specimens for Respiratory Viral Pathogens.,2018,"BACKGROUND Single-port laparoscopic surgery (SPLS) is an alternative, minimally invasive surgical approach for managing appendicitis. The aim of this randomized trial was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of SPLS in uncomplicated appendicitis. METHODS Between December 2009 and November 2010, 194 patients with radiologically diagnosed acute appendicitis were randomly allocated to undergo either SPLS or multiport laparoscopic surgery (MPLS). Patients with intraoperative findings of perforated appendicitis were excluded from the analysis. The primary endpoint was perioperative morbidity. All data were analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle. RESULTS Fourteen cases were excluded from the analysis. Of the remaining 180 patients, 90 were assigned to the SPLS group, and 90 to the MPLS group. Baseline characteristics were well balanced between the groups. In the SPLS group, the rate of conversion to MPLS was 11.1%. The operation time was 14.5 min longer for SPLS than for MPLS (p < 0.01), but there was no between-group difference in the rate of intraoperative complications (SPLS, 4.4%; MPLS, 0%; p = 0.12) or postoperative complications (SPLS, 4.4%; MPLS, 2.2%; p = 0.68). Compared to the MPLS group, the SPLS group had higher cumulative dose of analgesics (tramadol; 73.9 vs. 51.7 mg, p = 0.04), longer postoperative time to first passage of flatus (27.7 vs. 20.1 h, p < 0.01), longer postoperative hospitalization (2.5 vs. 2.1 days, p < 0.05), and higher total cost (1826.9 vs. 1662.4 USD, p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS This randomized trial indicates that, compared to MPLS, SPLS does not increase the rate of perioperative or postoperative complications in uncomplicated appendicitis, but may have disadvantages such as increased operation time, later postoperative functional recovery, longer hospital stay, and higher costs, although the difference is minimal (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01007318).","Kang, Byung Mo; Choi, Sung Il; Kim, Bum-Soo; Lee, Suk-Hwan",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-018-6028-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29340826/,175

149375,Early Growth and Neurologic Outcomes of Infants with Probable Congenital Zika Virus Syndrome.,2016,"PURPOSE Patients with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) are living longer due in part to changing treatment patterns. It is important to understand how changing treatment patterns affect patients' lives beyond extending survival. Research suggests that direct patient report is the best way to capture information on how patients feel and function in response to their disease and its treatment. Therefore, the purpose of this review is to summarize evidence of patients' experience collected through patient-reported outcomes (PRO) in RRMM patients, and to explore PRO reporting quality. METHODS We conducted a systematic search to identify manuscripts reporting PROs in RRMM and summarized available evidence. We assessed PRO reporting quality using the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) PRO Extension checklist. RESULTS Our search resulted in 30 manuscripts. Thirteen unique PRO measures were used to assess 18 distinct PRO domains. Pain, fatigue, and emotional function were commonly assessed domains though reporting formats limited our ability to understand prevalence and severity of PRO challenges in RRMM. Evaluation of PRO reporting quality revealed significant reporting deficiencies. Several reporting criteria were included in less than 25% of manuscripts. CONCLUSIONS Existing evidence provides a limited window for understanding the patient experience of RRMM and is further limited by suboptimal reporting quality. Observational studies are needed to describe prevalence, severity and patterns of PROs in RRMM overtime. Future studies that incorporate PROs would benefit from following existing guidelines to ensure that study evidence and conclusions can be fully assessed by readers, clinicians and policy makers.","LeBlanc, Matthew R; Hirschey, Rachel; Leak Bryant, Ashley; LeBlanc, Thomas W; Smith, Sophia K","Quality of life research : an international journal of quality of life aspects of treatment, care and rehabilitation",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11136-019-02392-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31848847/,175

150396,[Consensus of the ambulatory surgery commite section of the spanish association of surgeons on the role of ambulatory surgery in the sars-cov-2 pandemic.],2021-04-27,"BACKGROUND Lifestyle modification programs have improved the achievement of risk factor targets in a variety of clinical settings, including patients who have previously suffered a stroke or transient ischemic attack and those with multiple risk factors. Stenting Aggressive Medical Management for Prevention of Recurrent Stroke in Intracranial Stenosis (SAMMPRIS) was the first vascular disease prevention trial to provide a commercially available lifestyle modification program to enhance risk factor control. We sought to determine the relationship between compliance with this program and risk factor control in SAMMPRIS. METHODS SAMMPRIS aggressive medical management included a telephonic lifestyle modification program provided free of charge to all subjects (n = 451) during their participation in the study. Subjects with fewer than 3 expected lifestyle-coaching calls were excluded from these analyses. Compliant subjects (n = 201) had greater than or equal to 78.5% of calls (median % of completed/expected calls). Noncompliant subjects (n = 200) had less than 78.5% of calls or refused to participate. Mean risk factor values or % in-target for each risk factor was compared between compliant versus noncompliant subjects, using t tests and chi-square tests. Risk factor changes from baseline to follow-up were compared between the groups to account for baseline differences. RESULTS Compliant subjects had better risk factor control throughout follow-up for low-density lipoprotein, systolic blood pressure (SBP), hemoglobin A1c (HgA1c), non-high-density lipoprotein, nonsmoking, and exercise than noncompliant subjects, but there was no difference for body mass index. After adjusting for baseline differences between the groups, compliant subjects had a greater change from baseline than noncompliant subjects for SBP did at 24 months and HgA1c at 6 months. CONCLUSION SAMMPRIS subjects who were compliant with the lifestyle modification program had better risk factor control during the study for almost all risk factors.","Turan, Tanya N; Al Kasab, Sami; Nizam, Azhar; Lynn, Michael J; Harrell, Jamie; Derdeyn, Colin P; Fiorella, David; Janis, L Scott; Lane, Bethany F; Montgomery, Jean; Chimowitz, Marc I",Journal of stroke and cerebrovascular diseases : the official journal of National Stroke Association,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2017.10.017; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29169967/,175

Some individuals may have primary immunodeficiencies that predispose to severe infections caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Objective To explore the presence of genetic variants associated with primary immunodeficiencies among young patients with COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants Case series of pairs of brothers without medical history meeting the selection criteria of young (age <35 years) brother pairs admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to severe COVID-19. Four men from 2 unrelated families were admitted to the ICUs of 4 hospitals in the Netherlands between March 23 and April 12, 2020. The final date of follow-up was May 16, 2020. Available family members were included for genetic variant segregation analysis and as controls for functional experiments. Exposure Severe COVID-19. Main Outcome and Measures Results of rapid clinical whole-exome sequencing, performed to identify a potential monogenic cause. Subsequently, basic genetic and immunological tests were performed in primary immune cells isolated from the patients and family members to characterize any immune defects. Results The 4 male patients had a mean age of 26 years (range, 21-32), with no history of major chronic disease. They were previously well before developing respiratory insufficiency due to severe COVID-19, requiring mechanical ventilation in the ICU. The mean duration of ventilatory support was 10 days (range, 9-11); the mean duration of ICU stay was 13 days (range, 10-16). One patient died. Rapid clinical whole-exome sequencing of the patients and segregation in available family members identified loss-of-function variants of the X-chromosomal TLR7. In members of family 1, a maternally inherited 4-nucleotide deletion was identified (c.2129_2132del; p.[Gln710Argfs*18]); the affected members of family 2 carried a missense variant (c.2383G>T; p.[Val795Phe]). In primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells from the patients, downstream type I interferon (IFN) signaling was transcriptionally downregulated, as measured by significantly decreased mRNA expression of IRF7, IFNB1, and ISG15 on stimulation with the TLR7 agonist imiquimod as compared with family members and controls. The production of IFN-γ, a type II IFN, was decreased in patients in response to stimulation with imiquimod. Conclusions and Relevance In this case series of 4 young male patients with severe COVID-19, rare putative loss-of-function variants of X-chromosomal TLR7 were identified that were associated with impaired type I and II IFN responses. These preliminary findings provide insights into the pathogenesis of COVID-19.","van der Made, Caspar I; Simons, Annet; Schuurs-Hoeijmakers, Janneke; van den Heuvel, Guus; Mantere, Tuomo; Kersten, Simone; van Deuren, Rosanne C; Steehouwer, Marloes; van Reijmersdal, Simon V; Jaeger, Martin; Hofste, Tom; Astuti, Galuh; Corominas Galbany, Jordi; van der Schoot, Vyne; van der Hoeven, Hans; Hagmolen Of Ten Have, Wanda; Klijn, Eva; van den Meer, Catrien; Fiddelaers, Jeroen; de Mast, Quirijn; Bleeker-Rovers, Chantal P; Joosten, Leo A B; Yntema, Helger G; Gilissen, Christian; Nelen, Marcel; van der Meer, Jos W M; Brunner, Han G; Netea, Mihai G; van de Veerdonk, Frank L; Hoischen, Alexander",JAMA,https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2020.13719; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32706371/,175

METHODS A systematic review of literature was conducted until April 24th , 2020. From 6,843 articles, 49 studies were selected for a pooled assessment; cumulative statistics for age and sex were retrieved in 587,790 and 602,234 cases. Two endpoints were defined: 1) a composite outcome including death, severe presentation, hospitalization in intensive care unit (ICU) and/or mechanical ventilation; 2) in-hospital mortality. We extracted numeric data on patients' characteristics and cases with adverse outcomes and employed inverse variance random effects models to derive pooled estimates. RESULTS We identified 18 and 12 factors associated with the composite endpoint and death, respectively. Among those, a history of CVD (odds ratio (OR)=3.15, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 2.26-4.41), acute cardiac (OR=10.58, 5.00-22.40) or kidney (OR=5.13, 1.78-14.83) injury, increased procalcitonin (OR=4.8, 2.034-11.31) or D-dimer (OR=3.7, 1.74-7.89), and thrombocytopenia (OR=6.23, 1.031-37.67) conveyed the highest odds for the adverse composite endpoint. Advanced age, male sex, cardiovascular comorbidities, acute cardiac or kidney injury, lymphocytopenia and D-dimer conferred an increased risk of in-hospital death. With respect to the treatment of the acute phase, therapy with steroids was associated with the adverse composite endpoint (OR=3.61, 95% CI 1.934-6.73), but not with mortality. CONCLUSIONS Advanced age, comorbidities, abnormal inflammatory and organ injury circulating biomarkers captured patients with an adverse clinical outcome.

MATERIAL AND METHODS Between January 2008 and February 2013, a total of 35 patients (24 females, 11 males) underwent transperitoneal laparoscopic adrenalectomy to treat an adrenal mass. The patients underwent hormonal evaluation, chemical shift magnetic resonance imaging, or abdominal computed tomography. Twenty-seven patients (77.1%) had a hormone-active adrenal mass. RESULTS Eighteen right, 16 left, and one bilateral transperitoneal laparoscopic adrenalectomies were performed. The mean age and body mass index of the patients were 47.4 years and 26.6 kg/m(2), respectively. The mean adrenal mass size, operation time, estimated blood loss, and hospitalization duration were 41.9 mm, 94.7 min, 30 cc, and 2.4 days, respectively. No minor or major complications were observed perioperatively or postoperatively. In one patient (2.8%), the laparoscopic approach was converted to open surgery due to severe bradycardia resulting from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Histopathological examinations revealed adrenocortical hyperplasia in 23 (66%) patients, benign pheochromocytoma in 8 (22.8%) patients, and periadrenal paraganglioma, adrenocortical carcinoma, myeloid metaplasia, and myelolipoma in one (2.8%) patient for each entity.

153511,Modeling the effects of intervention strategies on COVID-19 transmission dynamics.,2020-05-15,"OVERVIEW Encephalitozoon cuniculi is a common obligate intracellular microsporidian parasite of rabbits that is increasingly recognised as a pathogen of cats and other mammalian species. These guidelines aim to review the literature on feline E cuniculi infection and provide recommendations on prevention and management. INFECTION IN CATS E cuniculi infection should be considered as a differential diagnosis in cases of feline uveitis and cataract formation. It is not significantly associated with either chronic kidney disease or meningoencephalitis. E cuniculi infection is more common in stray or feral cats than in pet cats. DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT Serological tests for antibody detection in the blood are easy to perform and can be useful for diagnosis, but their specificity is low as antibodies have been found in apparently healthy cats. PCR appears to be more sensitive than histopathology for diagnosis, and is more sensitive when performed on cataractous lenses compared with aqueous humour, although ease of sampling is an obvious limitation. Treatment is with fenbendazole for 3 weeks and phacoemulsification to remove microsporidia from cataractous lenses. ZOONOTIC RISK E cuniculi is a potential zoonotic agent, and there is a particular risk to immunocompromised humans posed by infected rabbits. Albeit infrequent, spore shedding has been identified in cats, so care should be taken around infected cats.","Addie, Diane D; Tasker, Séverine; Boucraut-Baralon, Corine; Belák, Sandor; Egberink, Herman; Frymus, Tadeusz; Hartmann, Katrin; Hofmann-Lehmann, Regina; Marsilio, Fulvio; Lloret, Albert; Pennisi, Maria Grazia; Thiry, Etienne; Truyen, Uwe; Hosie, Margaret J; Möstl, Karin",Journal of feline medicine and surgery,https://doi.org/10.1177/1098612x20941787; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33100172/,175
154073,The neutralization breadth of HIV-1 develops incrementally over four years and is associated with CD4+ T cell decline and high viral load during acute infection.,2011,"Background: Although most preterm infants breathe at birth, their respiratory drive is weak and supplemental oxygen is often needed to overcome hypoxia. This could in turn lead to hyperoxia. To reduce the risk of hyperoxia, currently an initial low oxygen concentration (21-30%) is recommended during stabilization at birth, accepting the risk of a hypoxic period. However, hypoxia inhibits respiratory drive in preterm infants. Starting with a higher level of oxygen could lead to a shorter duration of hypoxia by stimulating breathing effort of preterm infants, and combined with subsequent titration based on oxygen saturation, prolonged hyperoxia might be prevented. Study design: This multi-center randomized controlled trial will include 50 infants with a gestational age between 24 and 30 weeks. Eligible infants will be randomized to stabilization with an initial FiO2 of either 1.0 or 0.3 at birth. Hereafter, FiO2 will be titrated based on the oxygen saturation target range. In both groups, all other interventions during stabilization and thereafter will be similar. The primary outcome is respiratory effort in the first 5 min after birth expressed as average minute volume/kg. Secondary outcomes include inspired tidal volumes/kg, rate of rise to maximum tidal volume/kg, percentage of recruitment breaths with tidal volumes above 8 mL/kg, duration of hypoxia and hyperoxia and plasma levels of markers of oxidative stress (8-iso-prostaglandin F2α). Discussion: Current resuscitation guidelines recommend oxygen titration if infants fail to achieve the 25th percentile of the SpO2 reference ranges. It has become clear that, using this approach, most preterm infants are at risk for hypoxia in the first 5 min after birth, which could suppress the breathing effort. In addition, for compromised preterm infants who need respiratory support at birth, higher SpO2 reference ranges in the first minutes after birth might be needed to prevent prolonged hypoxia. Enhancing breathing effort by achieving an adequate level of oxygenation could potentially lead to a lower incidence of intubation and mechanical ventilation in the delivery room, contributing to a lower risk on lung injury in high-risk preterm infants. Measuring 8-iso-prostaglandin F2α could lead to a reflection of the true amount of oxygen exposure in both study groups.","Dekker, Janneke; Hooper, Stuart B; Giera, Martin; McGillick, Erin V; Hutten, G Jeroen; Onland, W; van Kaam, Anton H; Te Pas, Arjan B",Frontiers in pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.3389/fped.2019.00179; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31134170/,175
154124,Human bocavirus in an immunocompromised child presenting with severe diarrhea.,2009,"BACKGROUND Recent studies have shown the potential suitability of magnesium alloys as biodegradable implants. The aim of the present study was to compare the soft tissue biocompatibility of MgCa0.8 and commonly used surgical steel in vivo. METHODS A biodegradable magnesium calcium alloy (MgCa0.8) and surgical steel (S316L), as a control, were investigated. Screws of identical geometrical conformation were implanted into the tibiae of 40 rabbits for a postoperative follow up of two, four, six and eight weeks. The tibialis cranialis muscle was in direct vicinity of the screw head and thus embedded in paraffin and histologically and immunohistochemically assessed. Haematoxylin and eosin staining was performed to identify macrophages, giant cells and heterophil granulocytes as well as the extent of tissue fibrosis and necrosis. Mouse anti-CD79α and rat anti-CD3 monoclonal primary antibodies were used for B- and T-lymphocyte detection. Evaluation of all sections was performed by applying a semi-quantitative score. RESULTS Clinically, both implant materials were tolerated well. Histology revealed that a layer of fibrous tissue had formed between implant and overlying muscle in MgCa0.8 and S316L, which was demarcated by a layer of synoviocyte-like cells at its interface to the implant. In MgCa0.8 implants cavities were detected within the fibrous tissue, which were surrounded by the same kind of cell type. The thickness of the fibrous layer and the amount of tissue necrosis and cellular infiltrations gradually decreased in S316L. In contrast, a decrease could only be noted in the first weeks of implantation in MgCa0.8, whereas parameters were increasing again at the end of the observation period. B-lymphocytes were found more often in MgCa0.8 indicating humoral immunity and the presence of soluble antigens. Conversely, S316L displayed a higher quantity of T-lymphocytes. CONCLUSIONS Moderate inflammation was detected in both implant materials and resolved to a minimum during the first weeks indicating comparable biocompatibility for MgCa0.8 and S316L. Thus, the application of MgCa0.8 as biodegradable implant material seems conceivable. Since the inflammatory parameters were re-increasing at the end of the observation period in MgCa0.8 it is important to observe the development of inflammation over a longer time period in addition to the present study.","Erdmann, Nina; Bondarenko, Alexandr; Hewicker-Trautwein, Marion; Angrisani, Nina; Reifenrath, Janin; Lucas, Arne; Meyer-Lindenberg, Andrea",Biomedical engineering online,https://doi.org/10.1186/1475-925x-9-63; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20974008/,175

METHODS A mixed-methods exploratory sequential research design consisting of interviews with ambulance personnel (study 1), focus groups with ambulance educators, managers and peer supporters (study 2), and an online survey of graduating paramedic students (study 3). This paper reports the model developed from integrated findings, across all three studies. All research was undertaken in New Zealand and underpinned by a critical realist worldview. RESULTS The Prehospital Resuscitation Decision Making model identifies key processes, challenges and facilitators before, during and after ambulance personnel attend a cardiac arrest event. It is the only descriptive model of resuscitation decision making which acknowledges the decision-maker, non-prognostic factors and the importance of adequate preparation and support. CONCLUSIONS This research project is the first to comprehensively explore and model ambulance personnel perspectives on decisions to start, continue or stop resuscitation. The decision-making process is complex and difficult to simply formularise. Education and supports must assist ambulance personnel in navigating this complexity. Where resuscitation is withheld or terminated, ambulance personnel need to feel confident that they can effectively provide after-death care.","Anderson, Natalie E; Slark, Julia; Gott, Merryn",Emergency medicine Australasia : EMA,https://doi.org/10.1111/1742-6723.13715; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33423356/,175
154410,Using 3 TLR ligands as a combination adjuvant induces qualitative changes in T cell responses needed for antiviral protection in mice.,2010,"BACKGROUND Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery (FLS) is a validated program developed by the Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons (SAGES) to educate and assess competency in minimally invasive surgery (MIS). This study reports the first malpractice carrier-sponsored FLS course for surgeons in practice underwritten by the Controlled Risk Insurance Company of Harvard's Risk Management Foundation (CRICO/RMF). The study investigated the participating surgeons' pattern of MIS skills acquisition, subjective laparoscopic comfort level, operative activity, and perception of the FLS role in surgical education, credentialing, and patient safety. METHODS A 1-day postgraduate continuous medical education (CME) course consisted of didactic presentations of the leading MIS faculty, proctored FLS hands-on training, psychomotor testing, and cognitive computer-based examination. Voluntary anonymous pre- and postcourse surveys were distributed to the participants at registration and at completion of both the didactic teaching and the skills modules of the program. RESULTS The course was attended by 37 practicing surgeons in the Harvard system, and 86% of the survey forms were returned. The major driving forces for attending the course were directive from the chief/chairman (50%), improvement in MIS didactic knowledge (56%), and the belief that FLS would become a standard such as advanced trauma life support (ATLS), advanced cardiac life support (ACLS), or the like (53%). Surgeons reported that the FLS exam content was appropriate (Likert 4.41 +/- 0.91) and that mastery of the course material would improve safety (Likert 4.13 +/- 0.79) and technical knowledge of MIS (Likert 4.03 +/- 1.00). CONCLUSIONS This unique cooperative effort between a liability carrier, a professional surgical society, and proactive surgeons should be considered a model for advancing competency and patient safety. The survey results indicate a positive view of FLS in surgical training, safety, and MIS education.","Derevianko, Alexandre Y; Schwaitzberg, Steven D; Tsuda, Shawn; Barrios, Limaris; Brooks, David C; Callery, Mark P; Fobert, David; Irias, Noel; Rattner, David W; Jones, Daniel B",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-009-0617-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19688400/,175
154582,Microbiological and pathological examination of fatal calf pneumonia cases induced by bacterial and viral respiratory pathogens.,2010,"Reversible post-translational modification of serine and threonine residues by O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc), termed O-GlcNAcylation has been indicated to regulate the activities of a number of different proteins. Augmented O-GlcNAcylation contributes to the etiologies of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and cancer. Moreover, diabetic conditions increase the risk of colorectal cancer. However, the effect of O-GlcNAcylation in patients with colorectal cancer and concurrent T2DM has not been elucidated. The current study evaluated the level of O-GlcNAcylation in patients with colorectal cancer with or without T2DM. Notably, O-GlcNAcylation levels were significantly higher in tissues from patients with T2DM compared with those in patients without T2DM, and higher in cancer tissues compared with corresponding adjacent tissues. O-GlcNAcylation and cancer stage were more strongly correlated in cancer tissues from patients with T2DM compared with those from patients without T2DM. Additionally, distant metastasis was significantly correlated with O-GlcNAcylation in cancer tissues from patients with T2DM. β-catenin levels in colorectal cancer tissues were the highest in patients with advanced-stage cancer and concurrent T2DM. In SW480 human colon cancer cells, thiamet G (TMG) treatment and OGA silencing, which increased O-GlcNAcylation, significantly increased β-catenin and SNAIL in high-glucose, but not during normal-glucose conditions. These data suggest that O-GlcNAcylation is closely associated with distant metastasis, most likely through upregulation of the β-catenin/SNAIL signaling pathway in colorectal cancer patients with T2DM.","Naka, Yutaka; Okada, Toshihiko; Nakagawa, Takatoshi; Kobayashi, Eiko; Kawasaki, Yuka; Tanaka, Yasuyoshi; Tawa, Hideki; Hirata, Yuki; Kawakami, Ken; Kakimoto, Kazuki; Inoue, Takuya; Takeuchi, Toshihisa; Fukunishi, Shinya; Hirose, Yoshinobu; Uchiyama, Kazuhisa; Asahi, Michio; Higuchi, Kazuhide",Oncology letters,https://doi.org/10.3892/ol.2020.11665; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32724357/,175

155915,An Evaluation of Baseline Kidney Function in the REPRIEVE Trial of Pitavastatin in Human Immunodeficiency Virus.,2020-07-09,"BACKGROUND Few pre-hospital services have the possibility to accurately measure core temperature (T core). Non-invasive estimation of T core will improve pre-hospital decision-making regarding the triage and management of hypothermic patients. Thermistor-based tympanic temperature (T tymp) correlates well with T core in controlled studies; however, little is known about the feasibility of using T tymp under field conditions. This study assessed the impact of pre-hospital environmental factors on the accuracy of T tymp . Deep rectal temperature (T rect) was used as a substitute for T core . METHODS Normothermic volunteers (n = 13) were exposed to four simulated field conditions producing local cooling of the head and ear canal. After exposure, T tymp was recorded every 15 s for 10 min and compared with T rect . Descriptive analysis and Bland-Altman plots were used to assess agreement. RESULTS Immediately after exposure mean T tymp was low, but increased rapidly and reached an apparent steady state after 3-5 min. After 5 and 10 min, the mean temperature difference (∆T rect-tymp) ranged from 1.5-3.2 °C (SD = 0.5) and 1.2-2.0 °C, respectively. T rect remained unchanged throughout the study period. CONCLUSIONS After surface cooling of head and neck, T tymp did not accurately reflect core temperature within the first 10 min of measurement. The variation of ∆T rect-tymp was low after 10 min, regardless of the initial degree of cooling. With the risk of over-triage, T tymp may at this point provide an indication of T core and also exhibit a trend.

156273,Evaluation and clinical validation of an alcohol-based transport medium for preservation and inactivation of respiratory viruses.,2011,"INTRODUCTION The alarming rate of rise in COVID-19 cases led to lockdown in Nepal in order to curb the transmission and spread of the virus among the general public. This research was conducted to know the practices regarding the COVID-19 among the general population of Nepal. The aim of the study is to find out the value of different practices regarding COVID-19 which includes use of face masks, avoiding crowded places and hand hygiene. METHODS This was a descriptive cross-sectional study conducted among 509 online respondents residing 28th November to 15th December 2020 in Nepal. Ethical approval for the study was taken from the Nepal Health Research Council (Reference number 1350). Convenient sampling method was used. Data was analyzed using Microsoft Excel and Software Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 26.0. Point estimate at 95% Confidence Interval was calculated along with frequency and proportion for binary data. RESULTS Out of 509 participants, 492 (96.66%) (Confidence Interval= 95.1%-98.2%) uses mask, 437 (85.85%) (Confidence Interval= 82.82%-88.87%) avoided going to crowded places and 503 (98.82%) (95% Confidence Interval= 97.88%-99.76%) practiced hand hygiene during lockdown. Among 492 (96.66%) who wore face mask during the lockdown, 482 (94.69%) were still continuing using the face mask after the restriction was eased. CONCLUSIONS The study concludes good practices regarding COVID-19 among Nepalese population but is still not satisfying. This depicted adequate awareness among the public as a result of adequate dissemination of information and resources during the lockdown.","Chapagain, Sudeep; Singh, Aastha; Basnet, Prabina; Neupane, Rasik; Pokhrel, Nirdesh",JNMA; journal of the Nepal Medical Association,https://doi.org/10.31729/jnma.6428; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34508424/,175

OBJECTIVES To investigate changes in cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) and activity level in ambulatory persons with SCI during the first year after discharge from inpatient rehabilitation. SETTING Sunnaas Rehabilitation Hospital, Nesoddtangen, Norway. METHODS Thirty persons with incomplete SCI, all community walkers (25 males and 5 females, 18-69 years old) were recruited to a clinical trial of a 12 weeks home-based aerobic exercise program of either high or moderate intensity. During the last week of inpatient rehabilitation (baseline), participants performed a maximal exercise test on a treadmill (peak oxygen uptake; peak VO2) and a 6-min walking test (6MWT). Also, total daily energy expenditure (TDEE) and daily amount of steps were measured continuously during 7 days in the participants' homes. All tests were repeated after 3 and 12 months (post tests). RESULTS Twenty of the 30 clinical trial participants performed baseline and both posttests and are included in this secondary analysis. We found no statistically significant between-group differences in the time course over the first year of either peak VO2, 6MWT, or physical activity outcomes. Therefore, data from both exercise groups and the control group were merged for secondary analyses, revealing statistically significant increase over time in peak VO2, 6MWT, and TDEE. The increase over time in the average daily steps did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS Ambulatory persons with SCI were able to increase their CRF levels over the first year after discharge from inpatient rehabilitation, despite a minimal increase in activity levels.","Wouda, Matthijs F; Lundgaard, Eivind; Becker, Frank; Strøm, Vegard",Spinal cord,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41393-020-0514-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32647328/,175

METHOD Licensed clinical neuropsychologists within the United States recruited via neuropsychology-specific listservs (July-August 2020) to complete an online survey. RESULTS A total of 261 individuals completed the survey. Most (76%) reported delivering in-person testing in some capacity at the time of our survey. Relatively more private practitioners identified concerns with privacy/confidentiality (45.2% vs. 17.9%; χ 2(2) = 6.99, p < 0.05), legal issues (47.6% vs. 17.9%; χ 2(2) = 8.06, p < 0.05), and an undesirable precedent for legal/forensic cases (59.5% vs. 15.4%; χ 2(2) = 17.54, p < 0.001) compared to hospital or other medical (non-VA) practitioners. Multiple resources informed teleNP protocols, such as organization guidelines (87.6%), literature review (75.9%), webinars (72.4%), and consultation (68%). Several factors influenced test selection, including availability of normative data (70.1%), test familiarity (66.4%), administration time (63.5%), and evidence base (60.6%). Reported barriers to continuing teleNP after COVID-19 included need for improved teleNP norms (85.9%), domain coverage (84.7%), improved patient access to technology (74.1%) and further validation studies (84.1%). CONCLUSION TeleNP may not be feasible in all settings and/or referrals. Respondents employed multiple resources in aggregating teleNP protocols and considered several factors when selecting tests. Results highlight the complex and varied decision-making processes utilized by respondents to adapt to service delivery changes. Considering the many benefits of teleNP, future research addressing some of the potentially modifiable factors (e.g., technology access, attitudes regarding teleNP) and significant development needs for teleNP itself (i.e., improved teleNP norms, further validation studies, etc.) is warranted.","Rochette, Amber D; Rahman-Filipiak, Annalise; Spencer, Robert J; Marshall, David; Stelmokas, Julija E",Applied neuropsychology.

Rarely, viruses gain the ability to spread efficiently within a new host that was not previously exposed or susceptible. These transfers involve either increased exposure or the acquisition of variations that allow them to overcome barriers to infection of the new hosts. In these cases, devastating outbreaks can result. Steps involved in transfers of viruses to new hosts include contact between the virus and the host, infection of an initial individual leading to amplification and an outbreak, and the generation within the original or new host of viral variants that have the ability to spread efficiently between individuals in populations of the new host. Here we review what is known about host switching leading to viral emergence from known examples, considering the evolutionary mechanisms, virus-host interactions, host range barriers to infection, and processes that allow efficient host-to-host transmission in the new host population.","Parrish, Colin R; Holmes, Edward C; Morens, David M; Park, Eun-Chung; Burke, Donald S; Calisher, Charles H; Laughlin, Catherine A; Saif, Linda J; Daszak, Peter",Microbiology and molecular biology reviews : MMBR,https://doi.org/10.1128/mmbr.00004-08; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18772285/,175

The handles were designed with increased contact area between the fingers and thumb and the eye rings, and the eye rings were modified to have a more perpendicular insertion angle to the finger midline. Four different handle models were compared, including a conventional product. Subjects performed dissection, exclusion, grasping, precision manipulation and precision handling tasks. Electromyography and subjective evaluations were measured. Compared to conventional handles, the designated handle reduced the muscle load in the extensor and flexor muscles of the forearm and increased subjective stability. The activity of the first dorsal interosseous muscle was sometimes influenced by the shape of the other parts. The ergonomically designed endoscopic dissector handle used in this study achieved high usability. Medical instrument designs based on ergonomic concepts should be assessed with objective indices.

Weight, height, tricipital (TSF) and subscapular (SSF) skinfolds, and waist (WC) and mid-arm (MAC) circumferences were measured. Body mass index (BMI) and mid-arm muscle circumference (MAMC) were calculated. Nutritional status and metabolic risk were classified considering BMI and WC values, respectively. Diet quality was assessed with ESQUADA. Data were collected at household using the Epicollect5 application. Diet quality (in scores) was analyzed as continuous data and later categorized. The confidence interval was used for comparison between groups, Fisher's exact test for an association study. Adjusted multiple linear regression models were also estimated. P < 0.05 was adopted for statistical significance. RESULTS Overweight prevailed in 60.33% of individuals, especially among women (60.73%). High or very high metabolic risk was more frequent among women with ""very good or excellent"" diet quality. Higher diet quality score was associated with a reduction in TSF (β = -0.07; 95%CI -0.13 - -0.01) and an increase in MAMC (β = 0.09; 95%CI 0.00 - 0,18) in men and the reduction in weight (β = -0.04; 95%CI -0.07 - -0.01), SSF (β = -0.07; 95%CI -0.13 - -0,00) and WC in women (β = -0.06; 95%CI -0.09 - -0.02).

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to report (1) the effects of BFRE on vascular function in adults with or without chronic health conditions, and (2) adverse events and adherence reported for BFRE. Methodology Five electronic databases were searched by two researchers independently to identify studies reporting vascular outcomes following BFRE in adults with and without chronic conditions. When sufficient data were provided, meta-analysis and exploratory meta-regression were performed. Results Twenty-six studies were included in the review (total participants n = 472; n = 41 older adults with chronic conditions). Meta-analysis (k = 9 studies) indicated that compared to exercise without blood flow restriction, resistance training with blood flow restriction resulted in significantly greater effects on endothelial function (SMD 0.76; 95% CI [0.36-1.14]). No significant differences were estimated for changes in vascular structure (SMD -0.24; 95% CI [-1.08 to 0.59]). In exploratory meta-regression analyses, several experimental protocol factors (design, exercise modality, exercised limbs, intervention length and number of sets per exercise) were significantly associated with the effect size for endothelial function outcomes. Adverse events in BFRE studies were rarely reported. Conclusion There is limited evidence, predominantly available in healthy young adults, on the effect of BFRE on vascular function. Signals pointing to effect of specific dynamic resistance exercise protocols with blood flow restriction (≥4 weeks with exercises for the upper and lower limbs) on endothelial function warrant further investigation.","Pereira-Neto, Elisio A; Lewthwaite, Hayley; Boyle, Terry; Johnston, Kylie; Bennett, Hunter; Williams, Marie T",PeerJ,https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.11554; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34277146/,175

This paper involves a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1 study. A total of 40 participants were enrolled to receive a single intravenous dose of either etesevimab or a placebo in one of four sequential ascending intravenous dose cohorts. All 40 participants completed the study. Seventeen (42.5%) participants experienced 22 treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) that were drug-related, and the rates of these TEAEs among different dose cohorts were numerically comparable.

167911,"Respiratory tract explant infection dynamics of influenza A virus in California sea lions, northern elephant seals, and rhesus macaques",2021-03-18,"Proper lung development and function requires two independent but interrelated processes: branching morphogenesis to form the airway tree, and alveolar cell differentiation for peripheral gas exchange. The disruption of either branching or differentiation results in severe respiratory deficiencies and often in neonatal death. The molecular mechanisms that control branching patterns and the transition to alveolar differentiation are not completely understood. Here we report on the in vitro and in vivo characterization of the lungs of mouse embryos lacking a functional Svep1 gene. Our data demonstrate that the SVEP1 extracellular matrix protein is critical for airway patterning and for the process of transitioning from branching to alveolar maturation. Svep1-/- embryos on a C57BL/6J genetic background are characterized by hypoplastic lungs and a disorganized increase in distal airway tips which disrupts airway architecture and lobe shape. The lungs of Svep1 knockout embryos also have defects in alveolar differentiation. In vitro lung explant experiments demonstrated that SVEP1 normally inhibits branching morphogenesis and that treatment with a SVEP1 peptide can rescue the branching defects observed in Svep1 knockouts. Our findings reveal for the first time that Svep1 is essential for constructing the basic airway architecture and for the transition from lung branching to alveolar differentiation. Our results suggest therapeutic strategies to enhance lung development in patients with life-threatening respiratory disorders such as the lung hypoplasia and prematurity observed in neonates with congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH).","Foxworth, N; Wells, J; Ocaña-Lopez, S; Muller, S; Denegre, J; Palmer, K; McGee, T; Memishian, W; Murray, SA; Donahoe, PK; Bult, CJ; Loscertales, M",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.26.453586,175
168254,Emergence of second wave of SARS-CoV-2 infections during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic: a mini review. (Special Issue: SARS-CoV-2.),2020,"We present the results of an assessment of ice surface elevation measurements from NASA's Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) along the CHINARE (CHINese Antarctic Research Expedition) route near the Amery Ice Shelf in East Antarctica. The validation campaign was designed and implemented in cooperation with the 36th CHINARE Antarctic expedition from December 2019 to February 2020. The assessment of the ICESat-2 geolocated photon product (ATL03) and land ice elevation product (ATL06) was performed based on coordinated multi-sensor observations using two roof-mounted kinematic global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receivers, two line arrays of corner cube retroreflectors (CCRs), two sets of retroreflective target sheets (RTSs), and two unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with cameras. This systematic validation of the ICESat-2 data covered a variety of Antarctic ice surface conditions along the 520 km traverse from the coastal Zhongshan Station to the inland Taishan Station. This comprehensive investigation is complementary to the 750 km traverse validation of flat inland Antarctica containing a 300 km latitude traverse of 88∘ S by the mission team (Brunt et al., 2021). Overall, the validation results show that the elevation of the ATL06 ice surface points is accurate to 1.5 cm with a precision of 9.1 cm along the 520 km CHINARE route. The elevation of the ATL03 photons has an offset of 2.1 cm from a GNSS-surveyed CCR and is accurate to 2.5 cm with a precision of 2.7 cm as estimated by using RTSs. The validation results demonstrate that the estimated ICESat-2 elevations are accurate to 1.5–2.5 cm in this East Antarctic region, which shows the potential of the data products for eliminating mission biases by overcoming the uncertainties in the estimation of mass balance in East Antarctica. It should be emphasized that the results based on the CCR and RTS techniques can be improved by further aggregation of observation opportunities for a more robust assessment. The developed validation methodology and sensor system can be applied for continuous assessment of ICESat-2 data, especially for calibration against potential degradation of the elevation measurements during the later operation period.","Li, Rongxing Li Hongwei Tong Hao Qiao Gang Cui Haotian He Youquan Hai Gang Xie Huan Cheng Yuan Li Bofeng",The Cryosphere,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-3083-2021,175

This paper provides an overview of NCDs in Saudi Arabia and identifies various critical issues and challenges in reducing the burden of NCDs. All relevant data for this paper was extracted from existing published literature in various database including Medline, Scopus, ScienceDirect and PubMed. Google Scholar search engine was used to identify papers and reports on relevant literature published after the year 2000. NCDs account for about 73% of all deaths in Saudi Arabia. Deaths due to cardiovascular diseases account for 37% of all deaths, cancers 10%, diabetes mellitus 3% and other NCDs cause 20% of all deaths. Economic costs of NCDs likely to increase with the undesirable life style of youths and increasing share of old population. Further, the shortage of local health workforce, lack of primary health care focus and covid-19 pandemic are likely to affect the government efforts to prevent and control NCDs. Ministry of Health (MOH) needs to play a catalyst role in raising awareness of population through multi-sectoral linkages and policies to reduce the exposure to NCD risk factors. There is a need to review all relevant policy documents to ensure consistency of these policies with prevention and control measures of NCDs.","Albejaidi, F.; Nair, K.

170852,Orthotopic Transplantation and Engraftment of Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Alveolar Progenitor Cells into Murine Lungs,2020-06-15,"Since the onset of 2020, the spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has rapidly accelerated worldwide into a state of severe pandemic. COVID-19 has infected more than 29 million people and caused more than 900 thousand deaths at the time of writing. Since it is highly contagious, it causes explosive community transmission. Thus, health care delivery has been disrupted and compromised by the lack of testing kits. COVID-19-infected patients show severe acute respiratory syndrome. Meanwhile, the scientific community has been involved in the implementation of deep learning (DL) techniques to diagnose COVID-19 using computed tomography (CT) lung scans, since CT is a pertinent screening tool due to its higher sensitivity in recognizing early pneumonic changes. However, large datasets of CT-scan images are not publicly available due to privacy concerns and obtaining very accurate models has become difficult. Thus, to overcome this drawback, transfer-learning pre-trained models are used in the proposed methodology to classify COVID-19 (positive) and COVID-19 (negative) patients. We describe the development of a DL framework that includes pre-trained models (DenseNet201, VGG16, ResNet50V2, and MobileNet) as its backbone, known as KarNet. To extensively test and analyze the framework, each model was trained on original (i.e. unaugmented) and manipulated (i.e. augmented) datasets. Among the four pre-trained models of KarNet, the one that used DenseNet201 demonstrated excellent diagnostic ability, with AUC scores of 1.00 and 0.99 for models trained on unaugmented and augmented data sets, respectively. Even after considerable distortion of the images (i.e. the augmented dataset) DenseNet201 achieved an accuracy of 97% for the test dataset, followed by ResNet50V2, MobileNet, and VGG16 (which achieved accuracies of 96%, 95%, and 94%, respectively).","Halder, Arpita Datta Bimal",Machine Learning : Science and Technology,https://doi.org/10.1088/2632-2153/abf22c,175

This study examines these mitigation methods and association with COVID-19 infection, respiratory infection, and school staff wellbeing between October to December 2020 in Wales, UK. Methods A school staff survey captured self-reported COVID-19 mitigation measures in the school, participant anxiety and depression, and open-text responses regarding experiences of teaching and implementing measures. These survey responses were linked to national-scale COVID-19 test results data to examine association of measures in the school and the likelihood of a positive (staff or pupil) COVID-19 case in the school (clustered by school, adjusted for school size and free school meals using logistic regression). Linkage was conducted through the SAIL (Secure Anonymised Information Linkage) Databank. Results Responses were obtained from 353 participants from 59 primary schools within 15 of 22 local authorities. Having more direct non-household contacts was associated with a higher likelihood of COVID-19 positive case in the school (1-5 contacts compared to none, OR 2.89 (1.01, 8.31)) and a trend to more self-reported cold symptoms. Staff face covering was not associated with a lower odds of school COVID-19 cases (mask vs. no covering OR 2.82 (1.11, 7.14)) and was associated with higher self-reported cold symptoms. School staff reported the impacts of wearing face coverings on teaching, including having to stand closer to pupils and raise their voices to be heard. 67.1% were not able to implement 2-metre social distancing from pupils. We did not find evidence that maintaining a 2-metre distance was associated with lower rates of COVID-19 in the school. Conclusions Implementing, adhering to and evaluating COVID-19 mitigation guidelines is challenging in primary school settings. Our findings suggest that reducing non-household direct contacts lowers infection rates. There was no evidence that face coverings, 2-metre social distancing or stopping children mixing was associated with lower odds of COVID-19 or cold infection rates in the school. Primary school staff found teaching challenging during COVID-19 restrictions, especially for younger learners and those with additional learning needs.","Marchant, E.; Griffiths, L.; Crick, T.; Fry, R.; Hollinghurst, J.; James, M.; Cowley, L.; Abbasizanjani, H.; Torabi, F.; Thompson, D.; Kennedy, J.; Akbari, A.; Gravenor, M.; Lyons, R.

Methods: Comprehensive searches in MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, biorxiv.org/medrxiv.org, clinicaltrials.gov and the Global Infectious Disease Epidemiology Network (GIDEON) were carried out in early March 2020. Title/abstract and full-text screening, data abstraction, and quality appraisal (AMSTAR 2) were carried out by single reviewers. Results: A total of 6 SRs published between 1999 and 2018 were identified and included in the overview. The SRs included between 1 and 37 primary studies representing between 140 to 908 patients. All of the primary studies included in the SRs were carried out in long-term care facilities (LTCF) and examined pharmacological, non-pharmacological, or combined interventions. One high quality SR found mixed results for the effectiveness of hand hygiene to prevent infection (2 studies statistically significant positive results, 1 study non-statistically significant results). One moderate quality SR with meta-analysis found a moderate non-statistically significant effect for personal protective equipment (PPE) in preventing infection and found no statistically significant results for the effectiveness of social isolation. One moderate quality SR reported statically significant evidence for the effectiveness of amantadine and amantadine + PPE to prevent infection with respiratory illness in LTCF. Conclusion: The current evidence suggests that with antiviral chemoprophylaxis with adamantine is effective in managing respiratory illness in residents of long-term care facilities. The rest of the strategies can be used in long-term care facilities, yet have limited evidence supporting their use from systematic reviews.","Rios, Patricia; Radhakrishnan, Amruta; Thomas, Sonia M.; Darvesh, Nazia; Straus, Sharon E.; Tricco, Andrea C.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.19.20039081,175

This unprecedented pandemic, has caused severe socio-economic problems globally, catching many sectors off-guard and in a state of suspended uncertainty. While vaccines are just starting to circulate, there is still a need to practice new social norms, including social distancing during daily activities such as supermarket shopping. As such, contactless technology is critically needed and preferable to minimize physical contact and mitigate virus spread. In this paper, an automated shopping cart is proposed as a potential solution to avoid item scanning at cashiers and long queues at payment counters. This innovation leads to reduced risk of exposure to COVID-19. This is done by integrating a typical shopping trolley with Internet of Things (IoT) technology. A radio frequency identification (RFID) tag is attached to every product and automatically read whenever they are placed in a shopping cart. Payment and weighing processes can be conducted at the trolley itself which reduces direct and prolonged contact with both cashiers and other patrons, and at both checkout queues and weighing counters. This proves to be a critical way to break transmission chains.","Ho, Yun Faang Yaakob Naimah Mohamed Elobaid Elshaikh Azami Khairul Sidek Ong Bi Lynn Almashor Mahathir",Journal of Physics: Conference Series,https://doi.org/10.1088/1742-6596/1962/1/012051,175

This paper is aimed to rationally evaluate the transition to online learning in PNU from the student perspective. Five thousand ten student responses to an online survey were collected. The survey results indicate that the majority of students were satisfied by the quality of the delivered courses during this crisis period as they have received adequate support from instructors, IT, and leaders. Moreover, student satisfaction can be explained by the readiness and preparedness of PNU for such circumstances.

(Special Issue: SARS-CoV-2.),2020,"In recent years, (re-)emerging arboviruses including Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and Mayaro virus (MAYV) have caused growing concern due to expansion of insect vector ranges. No protective vaccine or specific antiviral strategies are currently available. Long-term morbidity after CHIKV infection includes debilitating chronic joint pain, which has associated health and economic impact. Here, we analyzed the early cell-intrinsic response to CHIKV and MAYV infection in primary human synovial fibroblasts. This interferon-competent cell type represents a potential source of polyarthralgia induced by CHIKV infection. Synovial fibroblasts from healthy and osteoarthritic donors were similarly permissive to CHIKV and MAYV infection ex vivo. Using RNA-seq, we defined a CHIKV infection-induced transcriptional profile with several hundred interferon-stimulated and arthralgia-mediating genes upregulated. Type I interferon was both secreted by infected fibroblasts and protective when administered exogenously. IL-6 secretion, which mediates chronic synovitis, however, was not boosted by infection. Single-cell RNA-seq and flow cytometric analyses uncovered an inverse correlation of activation of innate immunity and productive infection at the level of individual cells. In summary, primary human synovial fibroblasts serve as bona-fide ex vivo primary cell model of CHIKV infection and provide a valuable platform for studies of joint tissue-associated aspects of CHIKV immunopathogenesis.","Pott, Fabian; Postmus, Dylan; Brown, Richard J.

RNA viruses such as influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus and the new pandemic coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 can be highly pathogenic. Clinical and experimental evidence indicate that most severe and lethal cases do not depend on the viral burden and are, instead, characterized by an aberrant immune response. In this work we assessed how the innate immune response contributes to the pathogenesis of RNA virus infections. We demonstrate that type III interferons produced by dendritic cells in the lung in response to viral recognition cause barrier damage and compromise the host tissue tolerance. In particular, type III interferons inhibit tissue repair and lung epithelial cell proliferation, causing susceptibility to lethal bacterial superinfections. Overall, our data give a strong mandate to rethink the pathophysiological roles of this group of interferons and their possible use in the clinical practice against endemic as well as emerging viral infections.","Broggi, Achille; Ghosh, Sreya; Sposito, Benedetta; Spreafico, Roberto; Balzarini, Fabio; Lo Cascio, Antonino; Clementi, Nicola; De Santis, Maria; Mancini, Nicasio; Granucci, Francesca; Zanoni, Ivan",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.05.077867,175

Early detection biomarkers and disease mechanisms for these debilitating diseases are lacking. Exosomes are small extracellular vesicles attributed to carry proteins, mRNA, miRNA and sncRNA to facilitate cell-to-cell communication under normal and diseased conditions. Exosomal miRNAs have been studied in relation to many diseases. However, there is little to no knowledge regarding the miRNA population of BALF or the lung tissue derived exosomes in COPD and IPF. Here, we determined and compared the miRNA profiles of BALF and lung tissue-derived exosomes from healthy non-smokers, healthy smokers, and patients with COPD and IPF in independent cohorts. Results: Exosome characterization using NanoSight particle tracking and TEM demonstrated that the BALF-derived exosomes were approximately 89.85 nm in size and ~2.95 X 1010 particles/mL. Lung-derived exosomes were ~146.04 nm in size and ~2.38 X 1011 particles/mL. NGS results identified three differentially expressed miRNAs in the BALF, while one in the lung-derived exosomes from COPD patients as compared to healthy non-smokers. Of these, three- and five-fold downregulation of miR-122-5p amongst the lung tissue-derived exosomes from COPD patients as compared to healthy non-smokers and smokers, respectively. Interestingly, there were key 55 differentially expressed miRNAs in the lung tissue-derived exosomes of IPF patients compared to non-smoking controls. Conclusions: Overall, we identified specific miRNAs to develop as biomarkers or targets for pathogenesis of these chronic lung diseases.","Kaur, G.; Maremanda, K.; Campos, M.; Chand, H.

We leveraged public and surveillance M. tuberculosis (Mtb) whole genome sequencing (WGS) data, to generate more comprehensive country-level resistance prevalence estimates (antibiograms) using in silico resistance prediction. Methods: We curated and quality-controlled Mtb WGS data. We used a validated random forest model to predict phenotypic resistance to twelve drugs and bias-corrected for model performance, outbreak sampling, and resistance oversampling. We validated our estimates using a national DR survey conducted in South Africa. Results: Mtb isolates from 29 countries (n=19,149) met sequence quality criteria. Marginal genotypic resistance estimates overlapped with the South African DR survey for all drugs except isoniazid and second-line injectables that were underestimated (n=3,134); among multi-drug resistant (MDR) TB, estimates overlapped for pyrazinamide and the fluoroquinolones. Globally, mono-resistance to isoniazid was estimated at 10.9% (95% CI: 10.2-11.7%, n = 14,012. Mono-levofloxacin resistance rates were highest in South Asia (Pakistan 3.4% [0.1-11%], n=111 and India 2.8% [0.08-9.4%], n=114). Rates of resistance discordance between isoniazid and ethionamide were high with 74.4% (IQR: 64.5-79.7%) of isoniazid resistant isolates predicted to be ethionamide susceptible. The global susceptibility rate to pyrazinamide and levofloxacin among MDR was 15.1% (95% CI: 10.2-19.9%, n=3,964). Conclusions: This is the first attempt at global Mtb antibiogram estimation. DR prevalence in Mtb can be reliably estimated using public WGS and phenotypic resistance prediction for key antibiotics. Our results raise concerns about the empiric use of short-course fluoroquinolone regimens for drug susceptible TB in South Asia and suggest that ethionamide is an under-utilized drug in MDR treatment.","Dixit, A.; Freschi, L.; Vargas, R.; Groeschel, M.

Common indications include preeclampsia, haemorrhage, obesity or cardiac disease. Such patients would ordinarily be managed in a high dependence or critical care area and 18% of women cared for in our obstetric high dependency unit required invasive arterial monitoring. We observed varying degrees of comfort amongst midwifery staff on managing arterial lines and sought to formally assess this. Methods: An anonymous survey was sent to 67 midwives in our maternity unit across a two-week period in November 2020. We asked five questions regarding confidence in handling of arterial lines (Likert-type scale) and two in response to a series of proposed interventions. After identifying a service need, we designed a poster and distributed this both in visible locations on labour ward and online. We followed this with an educational package and drop-in sessions and repeated the survey in January 2021. Results: 46% (31) of midwives completed our initial survey. Following a poster campaign and drop-in sessions, 36% (24) of midwives completed a follow-up survey. 92% (22) had reviewed our poster and all found it useful. 18 midwives attended a drop-in session, all of whom found it useful. All assessed areas of arterial line care improved. [Formula presented] Figure: Midwife self-reported comfort with arterial-lines Discussion: Arterial lines are integral in management of critically-ill obstetric patients and demand high acuity nursing care. The Enhanced Maternal Care Guidelines include comprehensive statements regarding arterial line care. 1With the low frequency of individual midwives encountering an arterial line, attrition of skills is likely. Our goal is to empower midwives with educational resources to build on and maintain their skills and confidence. Our poster has been well-received and circulated to all midwives, placed in high visibility areas in labour ward and in the midwifery reference handbook in the high dependency unit. Educational sessions were challenging to coordinate during the COVID-19 pandemic so we are now moving to a virtual platform. We hope to capitalise on this significant improvement in midwifery confidence levels in arterial line management, but also to continue to foster our multi-disciplinary communication and working relationship between anaesthetic and obstetric teams.","Dickerson, J.; Rowan, C.; Hartley, P.; Licari, O.",International Journal of Obstetric Anesthesia,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijoa.2021.103097,175
179340,The role of antigen recognition in the γδ T cell response at the controlled stage of M. tuberculosis infection,2021-09-15,"After significant rainfall and subsequent surcharge event of March 15-19, 2020, the Collection Systems Group (CSG) for the Trinity River Authority of Texas inspected the external conditions of all of the major interceptor lines in the Central Regional Wastewater System for possible catastrophic line failures. On March 26, CSG staff identified a major pipeline failure on the 104-in. (2,650 mm) diameter pipeline for the West Fork interceptor. The pipeline failed in a section immediately adjacent to and between Interstate Highway 30 (IH-30) and the West Fork of the Trinity River, while the river was in flood stage from the latest significant rain event. The interceptor was conveying over 150 MGD (570,000 cubic meters per second) of wastewater meant for the Central Regional Wastewater System (CRWS) treatment facility, but a portion of the wastewater flow was escaping from the collapsed pipeline in to the river. Once CSG notified the Planning, Design, and Construction Administration (PDCA) team, our on-call emergency construction contractor was contacted and immediately mobilized to begin the process of stopping wastewater leakage and to begin pipeline repairs on the collapsed portion of the pipeline. The solution for the emergency repair was multifaceted beginning with the contractor constructing a massive sandbag wall between the failed pipe and the Trinity River at flood stage to stop wastewater leaking into the river and to keep the river from washing out the pipeline work area. Next, the contractor built a dry, elevated, working surface for excavators to access the pipeline site and to setup of bypass pumps. This work area was cut into the constructed slope of the Texas Department of Transportation (TXDOT) Right-of-Way (ROW). Several attempts were made to quickly repair the pipeline using oversized pipe (110in.) to replace the collapsed and broken pieces of existing pipe. With the still high flows from the recent rain event, this was not possible and that effort was abandoned. It was now obvious that we had to take the next step in elevating the effort, bypass pumping. Immediately bypass pumping operations were initiated. After 20 days of setup and stringing 20-in. HDPE bypass pipe along the Access Road for IH-30, we began pumping. The work concluded with the conclusion of bypass pumping, restoration of normal pipe flow, and streambank restoration along the river. All of the emergency work was performed while adhering to rapidly evolving conditions due to the pandemic without losing one member of the work-force to COVID-19. While the work took place in a difficult to access area during a period of greater than normal rain and a pandemic, the pipeline was put back in to service in less than 3 weeks. This was through communication, cooperation, and coordination from the contractor, engineers, and inspection staff. © 2021 ASCE.","Davies, T.; Metzler, S.

180403,Epitopedia: identifying molecular mimicry of known immune epitopes,2021-08-27,"Objective: Cytokine storm and Coagulopathy have been implicated as major causes of morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 patients. A black yeast Aureobasidium pullulans AFO 202 strain produced beta 1,3 1,6 glucan has been reported to offer potential immune enhancement and metabolism balancing, as well as mitigation of coagulopathy risks. The N 163 strain produced beta glucan is an efficient anti-inflammatory immune modulator. In this pilot clinical study, we report the beneficial effects of these two beta glucans on the biomarkers for cytokine storm and coagulopathy in COVID-19 patients. Methods: A total of 24 RT PCR positive COVID 19 patients were recruited (Age range: 18~62; 17 males and 7 females). Patients were randomly divided into three groups (Gr): Gr. 1 control (n=8); Gr. 2: AFO-202 beta glucan (n=8); and Gr. 3, a combination of AFO-202 and N-163 beta glucans (n=8). All three groups received the standard care while groups 2 and 3 received additional supplementation of beta glucans for 30 days. In addition to basic clinical parameters, we periodically evaluated D Dimer, IL6, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C reactive protein (CRP), the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), the lymphocyte to CRP ratio (LCR) and the leukocyte CRP ratio (LeCR). Results: The duration of hospital stay for all three groups was nearly equivalent. There was no mortality of the subjects in any of the groups. Intermittent oxygen was administered from day of admission for up to four to five days with mask (two to four Lpm) to two subjects in Gr. 2 and one subject in Gr. 3. None of the subjects required ventilation. The D Dimer values in Gr. 1, which was on average 751 ng/ml at baseline, decreased to 143.89 ng/ml on day 15, but increased to 202.5 ng/ml on day 30, which in groups 2 and 3 decreased on day 15 and continued to remain at normal levels until day 30. IL6 levels decreased on day 15 from an average of 7.395 pg/ml to 3.16 pg/ml in the control, 26.18 pg/ml to 6.94 pg/ml in Gr. 2 and 6.25 pg/ml to 5.22 pg/ml in Gr. 3. However, when measured on day 30, in Gr. 1, the IL-6 increased to 55.37 pg/ml while there was only slight marginal increase in Gr. 2 but within normal range, and the levels further decreased to less than 0.5 pg/ml in Gr. 3. The same trend was observed with ESR. LCR and LeCR increased significantly in Gr. 3. NLR decreased significantly in groups 2 and 3. There was no difference in CRP within the groups. Conclusion: In this exploratory study, consumption of Aureobasidium pullulans produced beta glucans for thirty days, results in a significant control of IL6, D Dimer and NLR, a significant increase in LCR, LeCR and marginal control of ESR in COVID 19 patients. As these beta glucans are well known food supplements with decades of a track record for safety, based on these results, we recommend larger multi-centric clinical studies to validate their use as an adjunct in the management of COVID-19 and the ensuing long COVID-19 syndrome.","Raghavan, K.; Dedeepiya, V.

181169,Retroviral Infection of Human Neurospheres and Use of Stem Cell EVs to Repair Cellular Damage,2021-08-09,"BackgroundCOVID-19 disease often requires invasive ventilatory support. Trans-laryngeal intubation of the trachea may cause laryngeal injury, possibly compounded by coronavirus infection. Fibreoptic Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing (FEES) provides anatomical and functional assessment of the larynx, guiding multidisciplinary management. Our aims were to observe the nature of laryngeal abnormalities in patients with COVID-19 following prolonged trans-laryngeal intubation and tracheostomy, and to describe their impact on functional laryngeal outcomes, such as tracheostomy weaning.MethodsA retrospective observational cohort analysis was undertaken between March and December 2020, at a UK tertiary hospital. The Speech and Language Therapy team assessed patients recovering from COVID-19 with voice/swallowing problems identified following trans-laryngeal intubation or tracheostomy using FEES. Laryngeal pathology, treatments, and outcomes relating to tracheostomy and oral feeding were noted.ResultsTwenty-five FEES performed on 16 patients identified a median of 3 (IQR 2?4) laryngeal abnormalities, with 63% considered clinically significant. Most common pathologies were: oedema (n?=?12, 75%);abnormal movement (n?=?12, 75%);atypical lesions (n?=?11, 69%);and erythema (n?=?6, 38%). FEES influenced management: identifying silent aspiration (88% of patients who aspirated (n?=?8)), airway patency issues impacting tracheostomy weaning (n?=?8, 50%), targeted dysphagia therapy (n?=?7, 44%);ENT referral (n?=?6, 38%) and reflux management (n?=?5, 31%).ConclusionsFEES is beneficial in identifying occult pathologies and guiding management for laryngeal recovery. In our cohort, the incidence of laryngeal pathology was higher than a non-COVID-19 cohort with similar characteristics. We recommend multidisciplinary investigation and management of patients recovering from COVID-19 who required prolonged trans-laryngeal intubation and/or tracheostomy to optimise laryngeal recovery.","Boggiano, Sarah Williams Thomas Gill Sonya E.; Alexander, Peter D.

We propose a model that couples epidemic spreading and resource diffusion in multiplex networks. The spread of disease in a physical contact layer and the recovery of the infected nodes are both strongly dependent upon resources supplied by their counterparts in the social layer. The generation and diffusion of resources in the social layer are in turn strongly dependent upon the state of the nodes in the physical contact layer. Resources diffuse preferentially or randomly in this model. To quantify the degree of preferential diffusion, a bias parameter that controls the resource diffusion is proposed. We conduct extensive simulations and find that the preferential resource diffusion can change phase transition type of the fraction of infected nodes. When the degree of interlayer correlation is below a critical value, increasing the bias parameter changes the phase transition from double continuous to single continuous. When the degree of interlayer correlation is above a critical value, the phase transition changes from multiple continuous to first discontinuous and then to hybrid. We find hysteresis loops in the phase transition. We also find that there is an optimal resource strategy at each fixed degree of interlayer correlation where the threshold reaches a maximum and under which the disease can be maximally suppressed. In addition, the optimal controlling parameter increases as the degree of inter-layer correlation increases.","Chen, Xiaolong; Wang, Wei; Cai, Shimin; Stanley, H.

Study Design: Cross-sectional study. Place and Duration of Study: A self-administered online survey was conducted in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, between June 2020 to November 2020. Methodology: We conducted a descriptive, cross-sectional web-based survey on active and nonactive adults of Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. A total of 537 respondents from Riyadh completed the questionnaire. The study included adults active during quarantine who are also residents of Riyadh. Residents of other cities and respondents younger than age 18 or older than 64 were excluded. Results: A total of 537 participants fulfilled the criteria. More than half of the respondents were aged 18 to 24 years (54.7%). Of those who did not exercise before quarantine, 42.9% (n = 91) started during quarantine, while 26.5% (n = 86) of respondents who exercised before quarantine stopped during the quarantine. Running and walking were the most common sports practiced by 70.9% of respondents during quarantine and 63.1% before the quarantine. Muscle strain/tears were the most common injuries before quarantine (26.2%), while bruises were the most common injury during quarantine (28.6%). Soccer and basketball were the most affected by quarantine. Conclusion: The number of active individuals had increased during quarantine. Paradoxically, the prevalence of sports injuries decreased. Soccer and basketball were the most significantly affected by a lack of participation during the quarantine;both were a common cause of sports injuries. Medical providers should investigate and support preventive measurements on sports that cause most injuries.","Alamir, M. A.; AlMohami, R. A.; Alharbi, A. A. A.; Almazied, M. K.; AlSwaji, G.

Spatial reasoning is a difficult skill to master for geology students, although a significant component of their studies involves visualising 3D structures from 2D representations, in particular, maps. More time and experience is necessary for students to practice their spatial reasoning skills, but this is a logistical challenge. The SaD tool provides an interface that resolves these logistics of practice time and field site access. Geology is often first characterised as a field science, but recent and increasing efforts to make a more inclusive environment have shown a demand to establish a comprehensive alternative to fieldwork/trips. The SaD tool is malleable, and while providing an inclusive way to teach core components, it is also capable of an array of field experiences for almost every sub-field within the geosciences. In this pilot study, introductory geoscience students were assigned a geologic mapping lab using the SaD tool. Results overall were positive in regard to the usefulness of the tool and provide us with three main directions for next steps in research and development.","Bursztyn, N.; Riegel, H.; Sajjadi, P.; Masters, B.; Zhao, J.

Bangladesh, being a developing country and with very limited resources, is fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. The frontline workers, especially the physicians and nurses are going through immense physical and psychological stress during the pandemic. Social unawareness, the absence of strict preventive policies, increasing workload, and the lack of resource management are making the frontline healthcare workers extremely vulnerable to COVID-19. In this paper, we present the outcome of our study on peritraumatic distress of COVID-19 among physicians in Bangladesh. Based on the user study, we have identified a number of key factors behind the peritraumatic distress and psychological stress caused by COVID-19. Our study shows, more than 78% respondents are suffering from peritraumatic psychological distress.

185323,SARS. Researcher told to stay home after China trip.,2003,"Epidemic models are useful tools in the fight against infectious diseases, as they allow policy makers to test and compare various strategies to limit disease transmission while mitigating collateral damage on the economy. Epidemic models that are more faithful to the microscopic details of disease transmission can offer more reliable projections, which in turn can lead to more reliable control strategies. For example, many epidemic models describe disease progression via a series of artificial 'stages' or 'compartments' (e.g. exposed, activated, infectious, etc.) but an epidemic model that explicitly tracks time since infection (TSI) can provide a more precise description. At present, epidemic models with 'compartments' are more common than TSI models , largely due to higher computational cost and complexity typically associated with TSI models. Here, however, we show that with the right discretization scheme a TSI model is not much more difficult to solve than a comparment model with three or four 'stages' for the infected class. We also provide a new perspective for adding 'stages' to a TSI model in a way that decouples the disease transmission dynamics from the residence time distributions at each stage. These results are also generalized for age-structured TSI models in an appendix. Finally, as proof-of-principle for the efficiency of the proposed numerical methods, we provide calculations for optimal epidemic control by non-pharmaceutical intervention.

METHODS: This multicenter, cross-sectional study was conducted on confirmed and suspected COVID-19 cases who were hospitalized in 19 public hospitals affiliated to Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences (SBMU), Tehran, Iran, between February 19 and May 12, 2020. Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of the infected cases were compared between the deceased and survivors after discharge. Case fatality rates (CFRs) were calculated across all study variables. Single and multiple logistic regressions were used to explore the risk factors associated with COIVD-19 mortality. RESULTS: Out of the 16035 cases that referred to the hospitals affiliated to SBMU, 16016 patients (99.93% of Confirmed and 99.83% of suspected cases) were hospitalized. 1612 patients died with median hospitalization days of 5 (interquartile range (IQR): 2-9) and 3 (1-7) for confirmed and suspected COVID-19 cases, respectively. The highest death rate was observed among ages>65 (63.4% of confirmed cases, 62.3% of suspected cases) and intensive care unit (ICU)/critical care unit (CCU) patients (62.7% of confirmed cases, 52.2% of suspected cases). Total case fatality rate (CFR) was 10.05% (13.52% and 6.37% among confirmed and suspected cases, respectively).

186441,"Prevalence, risk factor analysis, and follow-up of infections caused by three feline hemoplasma species in cats in Switzerland.",2006,"Under the Arms Trade Treaty, state parties must assess the extent to which the export of conventional arms might contribute to, inter alia, serious violations of human rights or international humanitarian law. The stated aims of Canada’s arms export licensing decision-making process are, similarly, to assess such risks on a case-by-case basis. This paper examines Canada’s ongoing arms transfer arrangements with Saudi Arabia in light of health-related international humanitarian and human rights law considerations enumerated in the Arms Trade Treaty. It assesses available information suggesting serious violations that implicate acts of commission by the Saudi-led coalition in the conflict in Yemen. The article centers on questions about the potential health-related consequences of Canadian-made, Saudi-coalition-used arms for people in Yemen and how risks are being assessed in export decision-making processes. Ultimately, it argues that Canada is failing to meaningfully take into account the possible negative impacts of its arms exports on people’s health and health care in Yemen. It counters the government’s approach to risk, which it argues is serviceable to exporter interests, with a health-based precautionary approach to exports.","Ferguson, Rhonda; Jamal, Zarlasht",Health Hum Rights,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7762919/,175

Here we describe a 54-nucleotide (nt) hairpin-type pseudoknot within the 288-nt 3' UTR of the bovine coronavirus genome and show by mutational analysis of both stems that the pseudoknotted structure is required for the replication of a defective interfering RNA genome. The pseudoknot is phylogenetically conserved among coronaviruses both in location and in shape but only partially in nucleotide sequence, and evolutionary covariation of bases to maintain G. U pairings indicates that it functions in the plus strand. RNase probing of synthetic transcripts provided additional evidence of its tertiary structure and also identified the possible existence of two conformational states. These results indicate that the 3' UTR pseudoknot is involved in coronavirus RNA replication and lead us to postulate that it functions as a regulatory control element.","Williams, G D; Chang, R Y; Brian, D A",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10482585/,175
187218,A hypothesis for an embryonic origin of pluripotent Oct-4(+) stem cells in adult bone marrow and other tissues.,2007,"Bovine rotavirus (BRV) and bovine coronavirus (BCV) are important causes of diarrhoea and death in newborn calves. Although these viruses belong to distinct viral classes, they both infect intestinal epithelial cells and induce similar clinical symptoms. Rotavirus usually causes an acute infection, but coronavirus infection can persist and reoccur in adults. Differences in viral structure and clinical outcome prompted us to postulate that innate mucosal immune responses would be markedly different following rotavirus and coronavirus infections. To address this hypothesis, gene expression following BRV and BCV infection was analysed in surgically prepared intestinal loops from 1-day-old colostrum-deprived calves. Gene expression was profiled at 18 h post-infection using bovine cDNA microarrays; the majority of differentially expressed significant genes were associated with the cell cycle and innate immune responses. A select group of these genes was validated by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). The expression of genes associated with interferons (IFNs), cytokines and Toll-like receptors, which were not present on the microarray, was analysed further by qRT-PCR. Strong activation of TLR3, IL-6 and p65 was observed in BRV-infected host tissues, but not in tissues infected with BCV. Both viruses also downregulated IFN- and pro-inflammatory cytokine-associated pathways. In vitro studies confirmed that IFN inhibited viral replication. All of these results together suggested either that very early events of host responses at 18 h post-infection were being observed, or that both viruses have unique effective strategies to evade host immune responses.","Aich, Palok; Wilson, Heather L; Kaushik, Radhey S; Potter, Andy A; Babiuk, Lorne A; Griebel, Philip",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17872528/,175
187397,In vitro inhibition of SARS virus replication by human interferons.,2004,"OBJECTIVE Pimecrolimus cream (SDZ ASM 981), a nonsteroid inhibitor of inflammatory cytokines, is effective in atopic dermatitis (AD). We assessed whether early treatment of AD signs/symptoms with pimecrolimus could influence long-term outcome by preventing disease flares. METHODS Early intervention with pimecrolimus was compared with a conventional AD treatment strategy (ie, emollients and topical corticosteroids). In this 1-year, controlled, double-blind study, 713 AD patients (2-17 years) were randomized 2:1 to a pimecrolimus-based or conventional regimen. Both groups used emollients for dry skin. Early AD signs/symptoms were treated with pimecrolimus cream or, in the conventional treatment group, vehicle to prevent progression to flares. If flares occurred, moderately potent topical corticosteroids were mandated. The primary efficacy endpoint was ranked flares at 6 months. Safety was monitored clinically, and a skin recall-antigen test was performed at study completion. RESULTS BASELINE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE PATIENTS: The mean age for both groups was approximately 8 years, and the majority of patients had moderate disease at baseline. PATIENT FOLLOW-UP AND EXPOSURE TO STUDY MEDICATION: The mean duration of follow-up (+/-standard error) was 303.7 (+/-5.30) days in the pimecrolimus group and 235.2 (+/-9.40) days in the control group. The discontinuation rate was significantly higher in the control group than in the pimecrolimus group (51.5% vs 31.6% at 12 months), and proportionately more patients with severe or very severe disease discontinued in the control group. The main reason for the higher discontinuation rate in the control group was unsatisfactory therapeutic effect (30.4% vs 12.4%). This resulted in a substantially higher mean number of study medication treatment days in the pimecrolimus group compared with the control group: 211.9 (69.8% of study days) versus 156.0 (66.3% of study days). Of those patients who completed 12 months on study, 14.2% and 7.0% of patients in the pimecrolimus and vehicle groups, respectively, used study medication continuously. EFFICACY Patients in the pimecrolimus group experienced significantly fewer AD flares than those in the control group, according to the primary efficacy analysis on ranked flares of AD (Van Elteren test). The proportion of patients who completed 6 or 12 months with no flares was approximately twice as high in the pimecrolimus group compared with control (61.0% vs 34.2% at 6 months; 50.8% vs 28.3% at 12 months). Fewer flares were observed in the pimecrolimus group regardless of baseline disease severity, so even severe patients derived benefit from the treatment. The analysis of time to first flare showed that treatment with pimecrolimus was associated with a significantly longer flare-free period (log- rank test). Covariate analysis indicated a statistically significant effect on time to first flare of baseline Eczema Area and Severity Index score, and whether patients had ""severe"" or ""very severe"" disease at baseline according to the Investigators' Global Assessment, although patients in all baseline disease severity subgroups benefited from treatment. Age had no significant effect. Fewer patients in the pimecrolimus group required topical corticosteroid therapy compared with control (35.0% vs 62.9% at 6 months; 42.6% vs 68.4% at 12 months), and patients in the pimecrolimus group spent fewer days on topical corticosteroid therapy (57.4% vs 31.6% [pimecrolimus vs control, respectively] spent 0 days on topical corticosteroid therapy, 17.1% vs 27.5% 1-14 days, and 25.5% vs 41.0% >14 days over the 12 months of the study). This steroid-sparing effect of pimecrolimus was evident despite pimecrolimus-treated patients being on study longer than patients in the control group. The average proportion of study days spent on second-line corticosteroids was 4.08% in the pimecrolimus group and 9.10% in the control group. Analysis of Eczema Area and Severity Index over time showed significantly lower median scores, thus indicating better disease control in the pimecrolimus group compared with the control group. Similar results were obtained from analysis of the Investigators' Global Assessment (not shown). The treatment groups were well balanced with respect to the number of patients using antihistamines during the study (57.2% vs 62.9%, pimecrolimus vs control, respectively). SAFETY There were no appreciable differences between treatment groups in the overall incidence of adverse events. The most frequent adverse events were common childhood infections and ailments, including nasopharyngitis, headache, and cough. The incidence of suspected drug-related adverse events was not significantly different in the pimecrolimus group (24.7% vs 18.7%--pimecrolimus vs control), and the incidence of serious adverse events was low (8.3% vs 5.2%--pimecrolimus vs control). Life-table analysis of incidence of adverse events revealed no significant differences between the treatment groups, except for cough. Local tolerability was good in both treatment groups. The most common application site reaction reported was sensation of burning (10.5% vs 9.3%--pimecrolimus vs control). There were no major differences between treatment groups in the duration or severity of application site reactions, most of which were mild-to-moderate and transient, occurring within the first week of treatment. Skin infections were reported in both groups. There were no between-group differences in the life-table analysis of time to first occurrence of bacterial skin infections nor in the adjusted incidence of bacterial skin infections. Although there were no significant differences between treatment groups in the incidence of individual viral skin infections, the incidence of grouped viral skin infections (12.4% vs 6.3%--pimecrolimus vs control) showed a slightly higher incidence in the pimecrolimus group. Laboratory values and vital signs showed no significant between-group differences. There were no significant differences between treatment groups in response to recall antigens in those patients who remained on study for 12 months. CONCLUSIONS Treatment of early AD signs/symptoms with pimecrolimus was effective in preventing progression to flares in more than half the patients, reducing or eliminating the need for topical corticosteroids. The benefits were consistently seen at 6 months across important disease severity subgroups and with respect to the various predefined efficacy endpoints. Furthermore, these benefits were sustained for 12 months, providing evidence that long-term treatment with pimecrolimus leads to better control of AD. Treatment with pimecrolimus was well tolerated and was not associated with clinically relevant adverse events compared with the conventional treatment group. The results reported here offer the prospect of effective long-term management of AD with reduced need for topical corticosteroids.","Wahn, Ulrich; Bos, Jan D; Goodfield, Mark; Caputo, Ruggero; Papp, Kim; Manjra, Ahmed; Dobozy, Attila; Paul, Carle; Molloy, Stephen; Hultsch, Thomas; Graeber, Michael; Cherill, Robert; de Prost, Yves",Pediatrics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12093983/,175

188400,Detection of rodent RNA viruses by polymerase chain reaction.,1994,"BACKGROUND The time lapse between onset of symptoms and a call to an emergency dispatch center (pain-to-call time) is a critical prognostic factor in patients with chest pain. It is therefore important to identify factors related to delays in calling for help. OBJECTIVES To analyze whether age, gender, or time of day influence the pain-to-call delay in patients with acute STsegment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). MATERIAL AND METHODS Data were extracted from a prospective registry of STEMI cases managed by 39 mobile intensive care ambulance teams before hospital arrival within 24 hours of onset in our region, the greater metropolitan area of Paris, France. We analyzed the relation between pain-to-call time and the following factors: age, gender, and the time of day when symptoms appeared. We also assessed the influence of pain-to-call time on the rate of prehospital decisions to implement reperfusion therapy. RESULTS A total of 24 662 consecutive patients were included; 19 291 (78%) were men and 4371 (22%) were women. The median age was 61 (interquartile range, 52-73) years (men, 59 [51-69] years; women, 73 [59-83] years; P .0001). The median pain-to-call time was 60 (24-164) minutes (men, 55 [23-150] minutes; women, 79 [31-220] minutes; P .0001). The delay varied by time of day from a median of 40 (17-101) minutes in men between 5 pm and 6 pm to 149 (43-377) minutes in women between 2 am and 3 am. The delay was longer in women regardless of time of day and increased significantly with age in both men and women (P .001). A longer pain-to-call time was significantly associated with a lower rate of implementation of myocardial reperfusion (P .001). CONCLUSION Pain-to-call delays were longer in women and older patients, especially at night. These age and gender differences identify groups that would benefit most from health education interventions.","Lapostolle, Frédéric; Loyeau, Aurélie; Beggaz, Yasmine; Boche, Thévy; Pires, Virginie; Le Bail, Gaëlle; Lamhaut, Lionel; Simon, Benoît; Dupas, François; Allonneau, Alexandre; Juliard, Jean-Michel; Benamer, Hakim; Tepper, Sarah; Bataille, Sophie; Lambert, Yves",Emergencias : revista de la Sociedad Espanola de Medicina de Emergencias,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33978331/,175
188419,Screening of specific antigens for SARS clinical diagnosis using a protein microarray.,2005,"The purpose of this systematic review is twofold: 1) to identify, evaluate, and synthesize the heretofore disparate scientific literatures regarding the effects of direct exposure to microgravity on the musculoskeletal system, taking into account for the first time both bone and muscle systems of both humans and animals; and 2) to investigate the efficacy and limitations of exercise countermeasures on the musculoskeletal system under microgravity in humans.The Framework for Scoping Studies (Arksey and O'Malley 2005) and the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins JPT 2011) were used to guide this review. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) checklist was utilized in obtaining the combined results (Moher, Liberati et al. 2009). Data sources,PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched for published articles through October 2019 using the Mesh terms of microgravity, musculoskeletal system, and exercise countermeasures. A total of 84 references were selected, including 40 animal studies and 44 studies with human participants. The heterogeneity in the study designs, methodologies, and outcomes deemed this review unsuitable for a meta-analysis. Thus, we present a narrative synthesis of the results for the key domains under five categories: 1) Skeletal muscle responses to microgravity in humans 2) Skeletal muscle responses to microgravity in animals 3) Adaptation of the skeletal system to microgravity in humans 4) Adaptation of the skeletal system to microgravity in animals 5) Effectiveness of exercise countermeasures on the human musculoskeletal system in microgravity. Existing studies have produced only limited data on the combined effects on bone and muscle of human spaceflight, despite the likelihood that the effects on these two systems are complicated due to the components of the musculoskeletal system being anatomically and functionally interconnected. Bone is directly affected by muscle atrophy as well as by changes in muscle strength, notably at muscle attachments. Given this interplay, the most effective exercise countermeasure is likely to be robust, individualized, resistive exercise, primarily targeting muscle mass and strength.","Moosavi, D; Wolovsky, D; Depompeis, A; Uher, D; Lennington, D; Bodden, R; Garber, C E",Physiological research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33992043/,175

188777,Viral hyperinfection of the central nervous system and high mortality after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for treatment of Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus-induced demyelinating disease.,1999,"It has been previously shown that a proline substitution for any of the conserved leucine or isoleucine residues located in the leucine zipper-like heptad repeat sequence of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) gp41 renders viruses noninfectious and envelope (Env) protein unable to mediate membrane fusion (S. S.-L. Chen, C.-N. Lee, W.-R. Lee, K. McIntosh, and T.-M. Lee, J. Virol. 67:3615-3619, 1993; S. S.-L. Chen, J. Virol. 68:2002-2010, 1994). To understand whether these variants could act as trans-dominant inhibitory mutants, the ability of these mutants to inhibit wild-type (wt) virus infectivity was examined. Comparable amounts of cell- and virion-associated gag gene products as well as virion-associated gp41 were found in transfection with wt or mutant HIV-1 provirus. Viruses obtained from coexpression of wt provirus with mutant 566 or 580 provirus inhibited more potently the production of infectious virus than did viruses generated from cotransfection of wt provirus with other mutant proviruses. Nevertheless, all viruses produced from mixed transfection showed decreased infectivity compared with that of the wt virus when a multinuclear-activation beta-galactosidase induction assay was performed. The ability of wt Env to induce cytopathic effects was inhibited by coexpression with mutant Env. Coexpression of mutants inhibited the ability of the wt protein to mediate virus-to-cell transmission, as demonstrated by an env trans-complementation assay with a defective HIV-1 proviral vector. These observations indicated that mutant Env, per se, interferes with wt Env function. Moreover, cotransfection of wt and mutant proviruses produced amounts of cell- and virion-associated gag gene products comparable to those produced by transfection of wt provirus. Similar amounts of gp41 were also found in virions generated from wt-mutant cotransfection as well as from wt transfection alone. These results indicated that the inhibitory effect conferred by mutants on the wt virus infectivity does not involve the late steps of Gag protein assembly and budding, but they suggest that the wt and mutant Env proteins form a dysfunctional hetero-oligomer which is impaired in an early step of the virus replication cycle. Our study demonstrates that mutations in the HIV-1 gp41 leucine zipper-like heptad repeat sequence dominantly inhibit infectious virus production.","Chen, S S; Lee, S F; Hao, H J; Chuang, C K",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9573241/,175

METHOD By using the polycentric nonrandomized concurrent controled trial and under the condition of glucocorticoid use, the patierts were divided into two groups: the integrated traditional Chinese and western mendicine(ITCWM) and simplicity western mendicine alone(WM). The observation indexes were time in hospital, pneumonia duration, mortality, glucocorticoid's gross dosage, glucocorticoid's average dosage of days and glucocorticoid use time. RESULT In the ITCWM group, average time in hospital was shortened (P = 0.058), pneumonia duration was shortened (P = 0.057), mortality fell (P = -0.001). The median of glucocorticoid' s gross dosage was 1,277.0 mg x d(-1) in the ITCWM group, and that was 1,680.0 mg x d(-1) in the WM group (P = 0.083).

METHODS People with type 1 diabetes (n = 585), aged 17-77 years, were randomized to insulin glargine once daily at bedtime or NPH insulin either once- (at bedtime) or twice-daily (in the morning and at bedtime) according to their prior treatment regimen and followed for 28 weeks in an open-label, multicentre study. Both groups continued with pre-meal unmodified human insulin. RESULTS There was no significant difference between the two insulins in change in glycated haemoglobin from baseline to endpoint (insulin glargine 0.21 +/- 0.05% (mean +/- standard error), NPH insulin 0.10 +/- 0.05%). At endpoint, self-monitored fasting blood glucose (FBG) had decreased similarly in each group (insulin glargine -1.17 +/- 0.12 mmol/L, NPH insulin -0.89 +/- 0.12 mmol/L; p = 0.07). However, people on >1 basal insulin injection per day prior to the study had a clinically relevant decrease in FBG on insulin glargine versus NPH insulin (insulin glargine -1.38 +/- 0.15 mmol/L, NPH insulin -0.72 +/- 0.15 mmol/L; p < 0.01). No significant differences in the number of people reporting >or=1 hypoglycaemic episode were found between the two groups, including severe and nocturnal hypoglycaemia. Insulin glargine was well tolerated, with a similar rate of local injection and systemic adverse events versus NPH insulin. CONCLUSIONS A single, bedtime, subcutaneous dose of insulin glargine provided a level of glycaemic control at least as effective as NPH insulin, without an increased risk of hypoglycaemia.","Home, P D; Rosskamp, R; Forjanic-Klapproth, J; Dressler, A",Diabetes/metabolism research and reviews,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16021649/,175

Recombination was carried out between the genome of a temperature-sensitive mutant of MHV-A59 (Alb4) and RNA transcribed from a plasmid (pFV1) containing the spike gene as well as downstream regions, through the 3' end, of the MHV-A59 genome. We have selected and characterized two recombinant viruses containing Q159L. These recombinant viruses (159R36 and 159R40) replicate in the brains of C57BL/6 mice and induce encephalitis to a similar extent as wild-type MHV-A59. However, they exhibit a markedly reduced ability to replicate in the liver or produce hepatitis compared to wild-type MHV-A59. These viruses also exhibit reduced virulence and reduced demyelination. A recombinant virus containing the wild-type MHV-A59 spike gene, wtR10, behaved essentially like wild-type MHV-A59. This is the first report of the isolation of recombinant viruses containing a site-directed mutation, encoding an amino acid substitution, within the spike gene of any coronavirus. This technology will allow us to begin to map the molecular determinants of pathogenesis within the spike glycoprotein.","Leparc-Goffart, I; Hingley, S T; Chua, M M; Phillips, J; Lavi, E; Weiss, S R",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9811696/,175

To gain insight into the role of the thymus in the pathogenesis of this experimental model, pathologic responses and cell wall tissue distribution were compared in congenitally athymic rats (rnu/rnu) and their euthymic littermates (NIH/rnu). Within 24 h, both rat strains developed acute arthritis, characterized by polymorphonuclear leukocytic exudate in the synovium and joint spaces. This acute process was maximal at day 3 and gradually subsided. Beginning 2-3 wk after injection, the euthymic, but not the athymic, rats developed the typical exacerbation of arthritis, characterized by synovial cell hyperplasia with villus formation and T helper/inducer lymphocyte-rich mononuclear cell infiltration. This process eventually resulted in marginal erosions and destruction of periarticular bone and cartilage. Parallel development of acute and chronic hepatic lesions was observed. Bacterial cell wall antigen distribution and persistence were similar in the athymic and euthymic rats. Cell wall antigens were demonstrated in the cytoplasm of cells within subchondral bone marrow, synovium, liver, and spleen, coincident with the development of the acute lesions, and persisted in these sites, although in decreasing amounts, for the duration of the experiment. Our findings provide evidence that the acute and chronic phases of the experimental model are mechanistically distinct. The thymus and functional thymus derived-lymphocytes appear not to be required for the development of the acute exudative disease but are essential for the development of chronic proliferative and erosive disease. Induction of disease is dependent upon cell wall dissemination to and persistence in the affected tissues.","Allen, J B; Malone, D G; Wahl, S M; Calandra, G B; Wilder, R L",The Journal of clinical investigation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3876354/,175
190077,Two genotypes of canine coronavirus simultaneously detected in the fecal samples of dogs with diarrhea.,2004,"KD-247 is a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets the third hypervariable (V3) loop of gp120. It can efficiently neutralize a broad panel of clade B, but not non-clade B, HIV-1 isolates. To overcome this limitation, we are seeking to prepare genetically-engineered single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) of KD-247 that will have broader neutralizing activity against both clade B and non-clade B HIV-1 isolates. Initial attempts of optimizing the expression of KD-247 scFv have resulted in the formation of insoluble protein. Therefore, we have established purification protocols to recover, purify, and refold the KD-247 scFv from inclusion bodies. The protocol involved step-wise refolding of denatured scFv by dilution, dialysis, and on-column nickel-affinity purification. Monomeric scFv was further purified by size-exclusion chromatography. Using far UV circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy we confirmed the expected beta-sheet profile of the refolded KD-247 scFv. Importantly, the refolded KD-247 scFv showed neutralizing activity against replication-competent HIV-1 BaL and JR-FL Env pseudotyped HIV-1, at potency comparable to that of the native full-size KD-247 antibody. Ongoing studies focus on the application of this system in generating KD-247 scFv variants with the ability to neutralize clade B and non-clade B HIV-1 isolates.","Ong, Y T; Kirby, K A; Hachiya, A; Chiang, L A; Marchand, B; Yoshimura, K; Murakami, T; Singh, K; Matsushita, S; Sarafianos, S G",Cellular and molecular biology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23273194/,175

The individual number of implants needed to securely exclude an aneurysm is unknown. Our primary objective was to compare midterm occlusion and complication rates in aneurysms treated with a single versus multiple PEDs without adjunctive coiling in a single procedure. PATIENTS AND METHODS Fifty-five patients harboring 58 intracranial aneurysms were treated with 121 PEDs between March 2011 and December 2013. About 38 aneurysms in 37 patients were treated exclusively with PED without adjunctive coiling in a single procedure. All pretreated (recurrent) aneurysms were excluded from analysis. Occlusion results were rated using the OKM-scale. Periprocedural complications were recorded. RESULTS Immediate angiographic results showed favorable obliteration (OKM C1-3+D) in 5/20 (25%) single-PED cases versus 8/18 (44%) in multiple-PED cases (p=0.3); complete obliteration (OKM D) was achieved in 4/20 (20%) with single-PED versus 5/18 (28%) in the multiple-PED group (p=0.2). Midterm (median: 7 months) angiographic rates of favorable occlusion were significantly higher in the multiple-PED group: 14/20 (70%) in single-PED cases versus 15/15 (100%) in multiple-PED cases (p=0.03); complete occlusions were observed in 12/20 (60%) single-PED cases versus 14/15 (93%) in multiple-PED cases (p=0.05). Retreatment was necessary in 3/20 single-PED (15%) and in none of the multiple-PED cases. Procedural complications did not differ between groups. CONCLUSION The nonstaged use of multiple PEDs may result in a higher rate of favorable occlusions at midterm in wide-neck aneurysms treated without adjunctive coiling without significantly increasing the rate of procedural complications.,"Kabbasch, Christoph; Mpotsaris, Anastasios; Behme, Daniel; Dorn, Franziska; Stavrinou, Pantelis; Liebig, Thomas",Journal of vascular and interventional neurology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27829966/,175

To analyze the relative sensitivity of the predicted hydrophobic face of the N-terminal heptad repeat to the insertion of uncharged, polar, and charged substitutions, mutations that introduced alanine, serine, or glutamic acid into positions 436, 443, 450, and 457 of the envelope protein were examined. Novel systems using Tat protein and the GHOST cell line were developed to test and quantitate the effects of the mutations on Env-mediated fusion and infectivity of the virus. While no single amino acid change at any of the positions interfered significantly with the synthesis, processing, or transport to the plasma membrane of glycoprotein complexes, 9 of the 12 nonconservative mutations in these residues completely abolished fusion activity and virus infectivity. Mutations in the central positions (443 and 450) of the heptad repeat region were the most detrimental to Env function, and even single alanine substitutions in these positions dramatically altered the fusogenicity of the protein. These results demonstrate that this N-terminal heptad repeat plays a critical role in Env-mediated membrane fusion and highlight the key function of central hydrophobic residues in this process and the sensitivity of all positions to charge substitutions.","Song, Chisu; Hunter, Eric",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12829817/,175

DESIGN Cross-sectional study. SETTING A residential care home for the elderly in Hong Kong with a local outbreak of SARS. PARTICIPANTS Residents and staff in the residential care home who had contact with three patients with SARS (residents A and B, and staff C). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Blood samples were tested for total antibodies to SARS-CoV by immunofluorescence antibody test. The transmission of SARS was elucidated based on information from standardised questionnaires, and records of investigation and surveillance by the Department of Health. RESULTS Among the 90 eligible residents, three died, one moved out, and 19 refused to participate. Of the 32 eligible staff, six refused to participate. None of the remaining 93 participants tested positive for antibody to SARS-CoV. Based on the chronological order, resident A might have transmitted infection to resident B and staff C. Sitting close to the bathroom doorway while resident A took a shower was the only contact of resident B with resident A. The only opportunity for staff C to have contact with body fluids/excreta of resident A was in the handling of rubbish from the resident's room. CONCLUSION Subclinical SARS-CoV infection was rare in a residential care home for the elderly with an outbreak of SARS. Nonetheless the close working and living conditions for staff and residents in such a home may facilitate transmission of SARS despite vigilant precautionary measures.","Heung, L C L; Li, T; Mak, S K; Chan, W M",Hong Kong medical journal = Xianggang yi xue za zhi,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16760548/,175

The aim of this retrospective study was to investigate the value of intra-procedural ultrasound fusion imaging in improving the therapeutic effect and safety of liver tumor ablation in difficult cases. A total of 502 patients (441 males and 61 females, aged 52 ± 11 years) with 805 liver tumors (16 ± 6 mm; range, 4-29 mm) who underwent thermal ablation with intra-procedural fusion imaging from October 2010 to June 2018 in our hospital were enrolled. Fusion imaging was employed for targeting, puncture guidance and immediate evaluation of the therapeutic response. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed one month after ablation and every 3~6 months in the follow-up period. 511 and 294 liver tumors were in classified in the difficult case group and the non-difficult case group, respectively. The technical efficacy rate was 99.4% (800/805), and no difference was found between the two groups (P=0.658). No significant difference in the local tumor progression rate was found between the difficult case group (1 year: 3.2%; 3 years: 7.6%; 5 years: 7.6%) and non-difficult case group (1 year: 2.1%; 3 years: 5.5%; 5 years: 11.6%) (P=0.874). The major complication rate was 1.8% (11/608). Injury to adjacent organs occurred in only 1 patient who sustained a bile duct injury. We conclude that intra-procedural fusion imaging can improve the therapeutic efficacy and safety of thermal ablation in difficult cases and may expand the indications for thermal ablation.","Long, Yinglin; Xu, Erjiao; Zeng, Qingjing; Ju, Jinxiu; Huang, Qiannan; Liang, Ping; Zheng, Rongqin; Li, Kai",American journal of cancer research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32775009/,175

This prompted the shifting of educational activities to the online learning system. Current investigation aimed to determine the perception of undergraduate students of various disciplines about online learning which has been implemented across all the universities of Pakistan in the wake of COVID-19 lockdown. Methods A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted and data was collected from ten different medical, engineering and art universities of Pakistan. Utilizing Openepi, the calculated data sample size was 600. Students were asked 23 different questions including a validated and reliable scale (α=0.952) composed of 14 questions to determine the satisfaction level of students from e-learning. Descriptive statistics, independent sample t-test, ANOVA and chi-square test were used to analyse data through SPSS. Results The most broadly embraced teaching methodology was online classes through Zoom Application. According to the developed scale, overall, 78% of students were dissatisfied from online learning. Students also raised concerns over assessment methods, student-instructor communication, fairness of examination and difficulty in understanding concepts. Majority of students preferred classroom teaching and 81% of respondents didn't want to continue with e-learning. Conclusion Results have depicted that students are not satisfied with e-learning and they pointed out some critical defects in the system.

In the past, other Coronaviruses have also been found to cause human infection, but not as widespread as COVID-19. Since Coronavirus sequences constantly change due to mutation and recombination, it is important to understand the pattern of changes and likely path the virus can take in the future. In this study, we have used the Shewhart control chart to identify and analyze hypervariable (hotspots) and hypovariable (coldspots) regions of the virus. Our analysis shows that SARS-CoV-2 has changed in a few regions of the genome. Analysis of SARS-CoV-1 and MERS sequences suggests that over time, mutations start accumulating in different regions and most likely SARS-CoV-2 may also follow a similar path. The results suggest a possible emergence of modified viruses over some time.","Mandal, Saurav; Roychowdhury, Tanmoy; Bhattacharya, Alok",Journal of biosciences,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33709963/,175

The disease has caused significant morbidity and mortality, particularly among patients with comorbidities. The current treatment involves supportive management alongside antiviral therapy and immunosuppressant therapy in severely affected patients. We describe a case of a patient with underlying lupus nephritis (LN) who presented with severe COVID-19 infection and concomitant LN flare with acute kidney injury (AKI). The patient was treated with antiviral therapy, Favipiravir, considering his risk of developing severe COVID-19 infection. As the patients would usually have AKI alongside LN flare, we administered initial steroid therapy at a lower dose (Methylprednisolone 50mg daily) and oral hydroxychloroquine despite the initial concerns on immunosuppressant usage in COVID-19 infections. Although our patient recovered relatively well from COVID- 19 infection, he continued to have positive reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) nasopharyngeal swab for COVID-19 up to 29 days of illness. His kidney function stabilised despite having persistent nephrotic range proteinuria. Hence, the attending team decided to pulse the patient with a high dose steroid (IV Methylprednisolone 250mg OD for three days) after two weeks of illness despite the persistent positive swab. The patient's condition continued to improve, and this case illustrates an approach in treating COVID-19 with concomitant active immune-mediated glomerulonephritis. We find that it is safe to institute high dose immunosuppressant in recovered COVID-19 patients two weeks after the illness.","Yusuf, A S; Cheong, X K; Rozita, M; Periyasamy, P; Ruslinda, M",The Medical journal of Malaysia,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34508391/,175

Two of the swine coronaviruses, namely transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV), have been extensively studied. TGEV replicates in both the enteric and respiratory tracts and causes enteric disease, whereas, PRCV replicates in the respiratory tract with limited to no replication in the enteric tract. We have isolated PRCV from swine herds with respiratory disease and have reproduced moderate pneumonia in gnotobiotic and conventionally reared pigs with two of the PRCV isolates. We have also identified two PRCV isolates with low virulence. One consistent difference that we have observed between PRCV isolates of different pathogenicities is in gene 3. The gene 3 is intact in the two virulent PRCV isolates, whereas gene 3 is altered in the two low virulence isolates. A similar observation has been reported for TGEV as a nonpathogenic TGEV mutant with a small plaque morphology had a deletion in gene 3. We have also observed that one of the low virulence PRCV isolates, IA 1894, which has a deletion in gene 3, replicates poorly in cell cultures. Collectively these studies suggest that gene 3 may be an important determinant for in vivo virulence and in vitro replication of coronaviruses.","Paul, P S; Vaughn, E M; Halbur, P G",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9192036/,175
195106,Role of enteric pathogens in the aetiology of neonatal diarrhoea in lambs and goat kids in Spain.,1996,"A panel of hybridoma antibodies that react with the surface peplomer glycoprotein (E2) of the murine coronavirus JHM were produced to characterize major antigenic domains associated with functions related to virulence. Three groups of hybridoma antibodies were differentiated by immunoprecipitation of lysates from JHM-infected cells. One group precipitated the virion structural proteins gp170 and gp98 together with the intracellular form of E2, gp150. A second group reacted with gp98 and gp150, and a third group precipitated gp150 only. Competition assays with biotinylated hybridoma antibodies allowed the definition of at least six different epitope groups. Only those antibodies which immunoprecipitated both gp170 and gp98 neutralized infectivity, inhibited cell fusion and protected infected rats against acute disease. Another class of antibodies binding to gp170 and gp98 also neutralized JHM virus, but did not inhibit fusion and did not protect against disease. Antibodies that immunoprecipitated gp150 and gp98 revealed only weak neutralization and did not inhibit cell fusion or protect animals. Four epitopes were defined by antibodies that immunoprecipitated gp150, but revealed no biological activity. These data indicate that the site responsible for cell fusion is associated with an epitope group carried by gp170 and gp98. Neutralizing antibodies bind to this and another epitope. Furthermore, protection of JHM-infected rats against acute disease requires both inhibition of cell fusion and neutralization of virus.","Wege, H; Dörries, R",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6209363/,175

A chicken usually lays about 280 eggs in a year, and egg yolk contains 100-150 mg of IgY per yolk, suggesting that more than 40 g of IgY per year can be obtained from each chicken through eggs. IgY is also an alternative to antibiotics for treatment of enteric antibiotic-resistant pathogens. Oral administration of IgY has proved successful for treatment of a variety of GI infections, such as bovine and human rotaviruses, bovine coronavirus, Yersinia ruckeri, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp., Edwardsiella tarda, Staphylococcus, and Pseudomonas. The IgY technology offers great future opportunities for designing prophylactic strategies against infectious GI diseases in humans and animals. However, there is still controversy regarding the stability of IgY through the GI tract. Finding an effective way to protect the antibodies from degradation in the GI tract would open the door for significant advances in IgY technology and nutraceutical applications.","Mine, Yoshinori; Kovacs-Nolan, Jennifer",Journal of medicinal food,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12495588/,175
195901,Epidemiology of human metapneumovirus.,2006,"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) is a new infectious disease that, in the short period between 1 February and 24 April 2003, has been diagnosed in more than 4000 patients. Its origin was traced to Guandong, a province in southeast China. The culprit organism was identified as a new coronavirus. The clinical presentation is unspecific and includes fever, respiratory symptoms, lymphopenia and pulmonary infiltrates on X-ray. Essential steps to prevent further dissemination of the virus are rapid identification, and treatment in an isolation unit. Despite all the international efforts and the rapid progress in the investigation of SARS coordinated by the World Health Organization (WHO), the epidemic has not yet been brought under control.","Feldt, T; Oette, M; Kroidl, A; Göbels, K; Richter, J; Häussinger, D",MMW Fortschritte der Medizin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12813976/,175

MATERIAL AND METHODS We evaluated third-generation dual-source DE-CTA studies in 31 patients with prior stent placement. Images were reconstructed with linear blending (F_0.5) and VMI+ at 40-150 keV. In-stent luminal diameter was measured and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) calculated. Diagnostic confidence was determined using a five-point scale. In 21 patients with invasive catheter angiography, accuracy for significant re-stenosis (≥50 %) was assessed at F_0.5 and 80 keV-VMI+ chosen as the optimal energy level based on image-quality analysis. RESULTS At CTA, 45 stents were present. DSA was available for 28 stents whereas 12 stents showed significant re-stenosis. CNR was significantly higher with ≤80 keV-VMI+ (17.9 ± 6.4-33.7 ± 12.3) compared to F_0.5 (16.9 ± 4.8; all p < 0.0463); luminal stent diameters were increased at ≥70 keV (5.41 ± 1.8-5.92 ± 1.7 vs. 5.27 ± 1.8, all p < 0.001) and diagnostic confidence was highest at 70-80 keV-VMI+ (4.90 ± 0.48-4.88 ± 0.63 vs. 4.60 ± 0.66, p = 0.001, 0.0042). Sensitivity, negative predictive value and accuracy for re-stenosis were higher with 80 keV-VMI+ (100, 100, 96.4 %) than F_0.5 (90.9, 94.1, 89.3 %). CONCLUSION 80 keV-VMI+ improves image quality, diagnostic confidence and accuracy for stent evaluation at lower extremity DE-CTA. KEY POINTS • The impact of noise-optimized virtual monochromatic imaging on stent visualization was assessed. • Virtual monochromatic imaging significantly improves stent lumen visualization and diagnostic confidence. • At 80 keV diagnostic performance for detection of in-stent restenosis was increased. • 80 keV virtual monochromatic images are recommended for stent evaluation of lower extremity vasculature.","Mangold, Stefanie; De Cecco, Carlo N; Schoepf, U Joseph; Yamada, Ricardo T; Varga-Szemes, Akos; Stubenrauch, Andrew C; Caruso, Damiano; Fuller, Stephen R; Vogl, Thomas J; Nikolaou, Konstantin; Todoran, Thomas M; Wichmann, Julian L",European radiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26960541/,175

This cooperation must always be unique and local, and at the same time provide an answer to generic and nationally set goals. AIM: Offering new insights on collaboration within and between domains. METHOD: Reflection on developments in the social domain and specialist mental healthcare using relevant literature and recent (inter)national experiences. RESULTS: It seems possible to provide better integral care by allowing FACT-teams to network together with Social Support partners (e.g. by sharing financial and/or human resources). In this process, networks of care for people with serious mental illness (SMI), develop over various phases and realize new partnerships. The model fidelity scale for FACT-teams was adjusted to facilitate that process. CONCLUSIONS The new FACT model fidelity scale is ready to allow FACT-teams to explore flexible local solutions for partnerships to realize the much-needed multi-domain integrated community care for people with SMI.","Westen, K H; van Vugt, M D; Bähler, M; Mulder, C L; Delespaul, P H; Kroon, H",Tijdschrift voor psychiatrie,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388852/,175

In this study, the mechanism by which the 7a protein induces apoptosis was examined. The 7a protein was tested for the ability to inhibit cellular gene expression because several proapoptotic viral proteins with this function have previously been identified. 7a protein inhibited expression of luciferase from an mRNA construct that specifically measures translation, whereas inhibitors of transcription and nucleocytoplasmic transport did not. The inhibition of translation and other cellular processes of gene expression have been associated with the induction of a stress response in cells. Western blot analysis using phosphospecific antibodies indicated that 7a protein activated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), but not c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase/stress-activated protein kinase. Taken together, these data indicate that the induction of apoptosis by the 7a protein may be related to its ability to inhibit cellular translation and activate p38 MAPK.","Kopecky-Bromberg, Sarah A; Martinez-Sobrido, Luis; Palese, Peter",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16378980/,175

To gain a better understanding of immune injury in the spleen, we investigated the number and distribution of various immune cell types in the spleens of SARS patients. We performed autopsies on six confirmed SARS cases, with six normal subjects as controls; spleen samples from these autopsies were examined with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) sections, in situ hybridization for SARS virus genomic sequences, and immunohistochemistry with seven monoclonal antibodies to five cell types. The number and distribution of these cells were measured and analyzed using an image analysis system. SARS genomic sequences were detected in all SARS spleens. The SARS spleens all had severe damage to the white pulp and showed an alteration of the normal distribution of various cell types. Immunocytes in the red pulp were decreased by 68.0-90.7% except for CD68+ macrophages and human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR positive antigen-presenting cells (APC), which were decreased to a lesser degree. On average, CD68+ macrophages were increased in size by 2.21-fold. We hypothesize that the collapse of the splenic immune system plays a key role in the clinical outcome of these patients.","Zhan, Jun; Deng, Ruishu; Tang, Junmin; Zhang, Bo; Tang, Yan; Wang, Jeffrey K; Li, Feng; Anderson, Virginia M; McNutt, Michael A; Gu, Jiang",FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17077309/,175
197060,The path of messenger RNA through the ribosome.,2001,"Four new porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) isolates were genetically characterized. Subgenomic mRNA patterns and the nucleotide sequences of the 5' ends of the S genes, the open reading frame (ORF) 3/3a genes, and the ORF 3-1/3b genes of these PRCV isolates were determined and compared with those of other PRCV and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) isolates. The S, ORF 3/3a, and ORF 3-1/3b genes are under intense study because of their possible roles in determining tissue tropism and virulence. Northern (RNA) blot analysis of subgenomic mRNAs revealed that mRNA 2, which encodes for the S gene, of the PRCV isolates migrated faster than the mRNA 2 of TGEV. The PRCV isolates AR310 and LEPP produced eight subgenomic mRNA species, the same number as produced by the virulent Miller strain of TGEV. However, the PRCV isolates IA1894 and ISU-1 produced only seven subgenomic mRNA species. All four of the PRCV isolates were found to have a large in-frame deletion in the 5' end of the S gene; however, the size and location of the deletion varied. Analysis of the ORF 3/3a gene nucleotide sequences from the four PRCV isolates also showed a high degree of variability in this area. The ORF 3 gene of the PRCV isolates AR310 and LEPP was preceded by a CTAAAC leader RNA-binding site, and the ORF 3 gene was predicted to yield a protein of 72 amino acids, the same size as that of the virulent Miller strain of TGEV. The PRCV isolates AR310 and LEPP are the first PRCV isolates found to have an intact ORF 3 gene. The ORF 3a gene of the PRCV isolate IA1894 was preceded by a CTAAAC leader RNA-binding site and was predicted to yield a truncated protein of 54 amino acids due to a 23-nucleotide deletion. The CTAAAC leader RNA-binding site and ATG start codon of ORF 3 gene of the PRCV isolate ISU-1 were removed because of a 168-nucleotide deletion.

197416,"Community epidemiology of human metapneumovirus, human coronavirus NL63, and other respiratory viruses in healthy preschool-aged children using parent-collected specimens.",2007,"The initial step in mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) RNA replication is the synthesis of negative-strand RNA from a positive-strand genomic RNA template. Our approach to begin studying MHV RNA replication is to identify the cis-acting signals for RNA synthesis and the proteins which recognize these signals at the 3' end of genomic RNA of MHV. To determine whether host cellular and/or viral proteins interact with the 3' end of the coronavirus genome, an RNase T1 protection/gel mobility shift electrophoresis assay was used to examine cytoplasmic extracts from mock- and MHV-JHM-infected 17Cl-1 murine cells for the ability to form complexes with defined regions of the genomic RNA. We demonstrated the specific binding of host cell proteins to multiple sites within the 3' end of MHV-JHM genomic RNA. By using a set of RNA probes with deletions at either the 5' or 3' end or both ends, two distinct binding sites were located. The first protein-binding element was mapped in the 3'-most 42 nucleotides of the genomic RNA [3' (+42) RNA], and the second element was mapped within an 86-nucleotide sequence encompassing nucleotides 171 to 85 from the 3' end of the genome (171-85 RNA). A single potential stem-loop structure is predicted for the 3' (+)42 RNA, and two stem-loop structures are predicted for the 171-85 RNA. Proteins interacting with these two elements were identified by UV-induced covalent cross-linking to labeled RNAs followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis. The RNA-protein complex formed with the 3'-most 42 nucleotides contains approximately five host polypeptides, a highly labeled protein of 120 kDa and four minor species with sizes of 103, 81, 70, and 55 kDa. The second protein-binding element, contained within a probe representing nucleotides 487 to 85 from the 3' end of the genome, also appears to bind five host polypeptides, 142, 120, 100, 55, and 33 kDa in size, with the 120-kDa protein being the most abundant. The RNA-protein complexes observed with MHV-infected cells in both RNase protection/gel mobility shift and UV cross-linking assays were identical to those observed with uninfected cells. The possible involvement of the interaction of host proteins with the viral genome during MHV replication is discussed.","Yu, W; Leibowitz, J L",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7884846/,175

Especially rational drug design offers an option to synthesize new drugs that are carried by specific drug transporters. Out of the presently identified transporter proteins PEPT1 and PEPT2, the high-affinity transporter PEPT2 is found in the respiratory tract. The transporter possess 12 membrane spanning domains and catalyses an electrogenic uphill drug transport using a transmembrane electrochemical proton gradient. PEPT2 is expressed in the bronchial epithelium and in alveolar type II pneumocytes in human airways. Kinetic studies demonstrated that peptidomimetic compounds including antibiotic, antiviral and antineoplastic drugs are carried by PEPT2. The transporter also carries delta-aminolevulinic acid into the airways. This molecule can be used for the diagnostics of pulmonary neoplasms and for photodynamic therapy. Using the recently published data on minimal structural requirements for PEPT2-substrates, rational drug design may lead to a new generation of respiratory drugs and prodrugs, which are delivered to the airways via the molecular mechanisms of the PEPT2 transport system.","Paul, H B; Welte, T; Groneberg, D A",Pneumologie,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16047280/,175

We demonstrate the performance of the methods on two applications, one involving U.S. opinion polls and one involving the modeling of COVID-19 outbreaks in Israel using survey data. The algorithms involve analytical marginalization of regression coefficients followed by numerical integration of the remaining low-dimensional density. The dominant cost of the algorithms is an eigendecomposition computed once for each value of the outside parameter of integration. Our approach drastically reduces run times compared to state-of-the-art Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms.

OBJECTIVE: To study the association between ferritin levels at admission, representing an inflammatory state, and hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: From May through July 2020, SARS-CoV-2 positive patients with moderate to severe clinical symptoms were evaluated at admission, regarding clinical and laboratory data on renal and hepatic function, hematologic parameters, cytomegalovirus co-infection, and acute phase proteins. RESULTS: A total of 97 patients were included; mean age=59.9±16.3 years, 58.8% male, 57.7% non-white, in-hospital mortality=45.4%. Age, ferritin, C-reactive protein, serum albumin and creatinine were significantly associated with mortality. Ferritin showed area under the curve (AUC) of 0.79 (p<0.001) for the cut-off of 1873.0ng/mL, sensitivity of 68.4% and specificity of 79.3% in predicting in-hospital mortality.

Till now there is no effective drug or vaccine against this virus that can make complete cure; however, a number of drugs are in trials. OBJECTIVES: In this review, we have focused on an alternative therapeutic approach using natural products utilizing host anti-viral responses for resolving COVID-19 pathogenesis. METHODS: We have searched databases like PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and Google Scholar for articles related to natural products and viral diseases, with a specific focus on coronaviruses, as well as other RNA viruses and recent updates on COVID-19 pandemic, and collected articles and reviewed comprehensively. RESULTS: Scientific studies clarified the viral pathogenesis that involved viral entrance into host cells, and antiviral response inside the cells, which can be effectively targeted by numerous natural compounds from different sources. Many of these compounds can potentially target viral genomic material or protein machinery. Natural products which were found effective against other coronaviruses, especially SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV (which emerged in 2002 and 2012, respectively) might be effective against SARS-CoV-2 due to their structural similarities; however, it needs time to establish the clinical success of these drugs. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 pandemic is a global emergency problem and urgent drug development is necessary. Natural products can be the biggest source of drugs, as they have been found effective in other coronaviruses previously; however, it needs time to establish these drugs for clinical application.","Shawon, Jakaria; Akter, Zakia; Hossen, Md Munnaf; Akter, Yeasmin; Sayeed, Abu; Junaid, Md; Afrose, Syeda Samira; Khan, Md Asaduzzaman",Curr. pharm. des,,175

Both situations of homogeneous and nonhomogeneous population were considered. Based on the calculations, a sufficient degree of social distancing based on its reproductive ratio is found to be effective in controlling COVID-19, even in the absence of a vaccine. With a vaccine, social distancing minimizes the sufficient vaccination rate to control the disease. Community awareness also has a great impact in eradicating the virus transmission.

In seropositive children, we compared antibody titres between children with and without PIMS-TS. RESULTS: Of 463 children, 91 (19.6%) were seropositive. The median (range) age of seropositive children was 5 years (1 month-17 years). Clinical presentation was consistent with Paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome associated or related with SARS-CoV-2 infection (PIMS-TS) in 48% (44/91) of seropositive children. The median (range) antibody titre was 54.8 (11.1-170.9) AU/ml among all seropositive children. The median antibody titre among the children with PIMS-TS (60.3 AU/mL) was significantly (p = 0.01) higher when compared to the children without PIMS-TS (54.8 AU/mL). CONCLUSION: We describe the antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 amongst hospitalised children in a LMIC tertiary children's hospital. Almost half of the seropositive children had PIMS-TS. Antibody levels may be helpful in the diagnosis and disease stratification of PIMS-TS. LAY SUMMARY: Children usually present with minimal or no symptoms of COVID-19 infection. However, Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) or Paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome associated or related with SARS-CoV-2 infection (PIMS-TS) has emerged as a distinctive paediatric illness related to SARS-CoV-2. Recently, antibody testing for SARS-CoV-2 is being used increasingly as a diagnostic test for PIMS-TS. However, data on the antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in children are sparse. We, therefore, attempted to identify the seropositivity and describe the clinical spectrum of COVID-19 infection amongst infants and children getting hospitalised in a children's hospital in south India. Nearly one-fifth of the hospitalised children tested serology positive over 4 months. Antibody levels in children with PIMS-TS were significantly higher in comparison to the other two groups (acute COVID-19 infection and children without PIMS-TS). Results from our study suggest that all children are at risk of COVID-19 infection though they may present with mild illness or no symptoms. We also observed that antibody testing may have a possible role in diagnosis of PIMS-TS.","Venkataraman, Aishwarya; Balasubramanian, S; Putilibai, Sulochana; Lakshan Raj, S; Amperayani, Sumanth; Senthilnathan, S; Manoharan, Anand; Sophi, Arokia; Amutha, R; Sadasivam, Kalaimaran; Goenka, Anu; Ramanan, A V",J. trop. pedriatr,,175

To broaden the set of diseases under study, we developed a Deep Learning tool for Natural Language Processing that extracts mentions of virtually any medical condition or disease from unstructured social media text. With that tool at hand, we processed Reddit and Twitter posts, analyzed the clusters of the two resulting co-occurrence networks of conditions, and discovered that they correspond to well-defined categories of medical conditions. This resulted in the creation of the first comprehensive taxonomy of medical conditions automatically derived from online discussions. We validated the structure of our taxonomy against the official International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-11), finding matches of our clusters with 20 official categories, out of 22. Based on the mentions of our taxonomy's sub-categories on Reddit posts geo-referenced in the U.S., we were then able to compute disease-specific health scores. As opposed to counts of disease mentions or counts with no knowledge of our taxonomy's structure, we found that our disease-specific health scores are causally linked with the officially reported prevalence of 18 conditions.","Scepanovic, Sanja; Aiello, Luca Maria; Zhou, Ke; Joglekar, Sagar; Quercia, Daniele",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.01169v1.pdf,175

224045,In Search of Herbal Anti-SARS-Cov2 Compounds,2020,"Introduction Asthma is a clinical syndrome characterized by reversible and recurrent airway obstruction leading to the symptoms of wheezing, cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, and respiratory distress. It is one of the most common lung pathologies worldwide. Its incidence is on the rise in Pakistan, which may be due to overt environmental pollution or improving screening protocols. Irrespective more and more patients are now being diagnosed as cases of asthma and this has led to renewed interest in research for the subject locally. Vitamin D plays a key component of the immune system and its deficiency has been associated with diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, rheumatoid arthritis, depression, sepsis, and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia. The role of vitamin D in exacerbation, prevention, causation, and treatment of asthma is still up for debate. However, as more data emerges, it is becoming evident that vitamin D in one way or another is linked to outcomes in asthma. Especially the deficiency of vitamin D in asthma and its supplementation has garnered great attention in scientific trials. Our research is just one small step in this direction. This study aims to evaluate the frequency of vitamin D deficiency in patients with asthma. Methods This was a retrospective cross-sectional cohort conducted al the Department of Medicine of Abbasi Shaheed Hospital Karachi (ASHK) during March 2019 to August 2019. Patients of either gender aged &gt;= 18 years that were diagnosed with cases of asthma were eligible to be included in the study. Asthma was defined in accordance with the latest guidelines issued by the Pakistan Chest Society. A vitamin D level of &lt;20 ng/dI was considered deficient. Patient confidentiality was made certain. Results A total of 97 (62.98%) of the 154 patients included in the study had &lt;20 ng/ml of vitamin D level. The mean vitamin D level recorded in this study was 15.3414.21 ng/dl. The male-to-female ratio was 1:5. The mean age of our cohort was 42.7814.56 years. The mean duration of disease, i.e., asthma was 6.713.68 years. Both the age of the patients and duration of the disease were found to be statistically significant with respect to vitamin D levels in asthmatics. Conclusions The frequency of vitamin D deficiency is very high in patients with asthma. These suboptimal levels are significantly influenced by the age of the patient and the duration of the disease.","Alvi, S.; Syed, J. G.; Nusrat, B.; Razvi, S. K. A.; Shah, Z. Z.; Khan, Y.

RT-PCR is the gold standard, but can be false-negative. METHODS: 119 residents and 93 staff members were tested with RT-PCR test and/or a rapid IgM/IgG test. Of these participants, 176 had both tests, 24 only RT-PCR, and 12 only IgM/IgG in the period April 14 to 16 April 2020. RESULTS: 40 (34%) residents and 11 (13%) staff were PCR-positive. Using a rapid IgM/IgG test, 17 (17%) residents and 18 (20%) staff were positive for IgM and/or IgG (IgM/IgG). Thirty-two PCR-positive residents had an IgM/IgG test: 9 (28%), 11 (34%), and 13 (41%) were positive for IgM, IgG, and IgM/IgG. Ten PCR-positive staff had an IgM/IgG test: 3 (30%), 6 (60%), and 6 (60%) were positive for IgM, IgG, and IgM/IgG. Additional IgM/IgG tests were performed in 9 residents 11 to 14 days after the positive RT-PCR test. Of those, 7 (78%) tested positive for IgM/IgG. When retested 3 weeks later, the 2 remaining residents also tested positive. Of the 134 PCR-negative participants who had an IgM/IgG test, 15 were positive for IgM/IgG (8% of the 200 participants tested with RT-PCR). CONCLUSIONS: During an acute outbreak in a nursing home, 26% of residents and staff were PCR-positive. An additional 8% was diagnosed using IgM/IgG antibody testing. The use of RT-PCR alone as the sole diagnostic method for surveillance during an acute outbreak is insufficient to grab the full extent of the outbreak.","Buntinx, Frank; Claes, Peter; Gulikers, Marjo; Verbakel, Jan; Jan, De Lepeleire; Van der Elst, Michaël; Van Elslande, Jan; Van Ranst, Marc; Vermeersch, Pieter",Acta Clin Belg,,175

So far, it has caused ~ 4000 deaths in this country. We aimed to systematically characterize clinical features and determine risk factors of sudden death for COVID-19 patients. Methods: Deceased patients with COVID-19 in Tongji hospital from January 22 to March 23, 2020 were extracted. Patients who died within 24 hours after admission were identified as sudden deaths, and the others formed non-sudden deaths. The differences in clinical characteristics between the two groups were estimated. Risk factors associated with sudden deaths were explored by logistic regression. Results: 281 deceased patients were enrolled in this study. Sudden death occurred in 28 (10.0%) patients, including 4 (14.3%) admitted to the intensive care unit. Fatigue was more common in sudden deaths (11, 47.8%) than in non-sudden deaths (40, 17.2%). Both the count and percentage of eosinophils were lower in sudden deaths than that in non-sudden deaths (P = 0.006 and P = 0.004). Compared with non-sudden deaths, sudden deaths had higher plasma levels of procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, D-dimer, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, lactate dehydrogenase, alkaline phosphatase and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide. There were not significant differences in gender, age, chest CT image features and comorbidities observed. Conclusions: The differences between the two groups suggested more severe systemic inflammation, multi-organ dysfunction, especially impaired liver and heart function in COVID-19 patients who died suddenly after admission. More researches are needed to verify these points.","Yang, Nan; Tian, Kunming; Jin, Meng; Zhang, Xu; Zhang, Fengqin; Shi, Xiuquan; Wang, Xiaoyang; Niu, Siyuan; Shi, Jing; Hu, Ke; Liu, Kui; Peng, Ping; Wang, Ying; Zhang, Huilan; Tian, Jianbo",J Glob Health,,175

As a result, the government authorized the hiring of senior students. OBJECTIVES: To explore the perspectives of a group of final-year nursing students who were hired on the basis of a relief contract for health professionals during the first COVID-19 outbreak, regarding their learning process and their mixed role as students and novice nurses. DESIGN: A qualitative exploratory study was conducted. SETTINGS: The Nursing Department of the European University of Madrid, and the Red Cross College of Nursing. PARTICIPANTS: Eighteen nursing students were recruited, aged between 18 and 65 years old, enrolled in the fourth year of Nursing Studies and who were hired under a relief contract for health professionals during the pandemic. METHODS: Purposive sampling was used. Semi-structured, in-depth interviews were carried out using a question guide. Interviews were conducted in a private video chat room platform. Also, a thematic, inductive analysis was performed. This study was conducted according to the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research and the Standards for Reporting Qualitative Research. RESULTS: Four specific themes emerged: a) The students' role during the relief contract; b) The learning process during the pandemic; c) Barriers to learning; and d) A unique learning opportunity. The students had an undefined mixed role, which hindered their skills and activities. Learning was self-directed, sometimes through trial and error, and through experiencing critical events. Time constraints and having to learn under pressure were experienced as difficulties for learning. Nevertheless, this was a unique professional learning opportunity. The students learned to be organized and effective, acknowledge their limitations, gain confidence, face their fears, and mature.

Frontal EEG patterns are reported to be a characteristic finding in COVID-19 encephalopathy. Although several reports of EEG abnormalities are available, there is lack of clarity about typical findings. METHODS: Research databases were queried with the terms ""COVID"" OR ""coronavirus"" OR ""SARS"" AND ""EEG"". Available data was analyzed from 617 patients with EEG findings reported in 84 studies. RESULTS: The median age was 61.3 years (IQR 45-69, 33.3 % female). Common EEG indications were altered mental status (61.7 %), seizure-like events (31.2 %), and cardiac arrest (3.5 %). Abnormal EEG findings (n = 543, 88.0 %) were sub-classified into three groups: (1) Background abnormalities: diffuse slowing (n = 423, 68.6 %), focal slowing (n = 105, 17.0 %), and absent posterior dominant rhythm (n = 63, 10.2 %). (2) Periodic and rhythmic EEG patterns: generalized periodic discharges (n = 35, 5.7 %), lateralized/multifocal periodic discharges (n = 24, 3.9 %), generalized rhythmic activity (n = 32, 5.2 %). (3) Epileptiform changes: focal (n = 35, 5.7 %), generalized (n = 27, 4.4 %), seizures/status epilepticus (n = 34, 5.5 %). Frontal EEG patterns comprised of approximately a third of all findings. In studies that utilized continuous EEG, 96.8 % (n = 243) of the 251 patients were reported to have abnormalities compared to 85.0 % (n = 311) patients who did not undergo continuous EEG monitoring (&#967;2 = 22.8, p =< 0.001). SIGNIFICANCE: EEG abnormalities are common in COVID-19 related encephalopathy and correlates with disease severity, preexisting neurological conditions including epilepsy and prolonged EEG monitoring. Frontal findings are frequent and have been proposed as a biomarker for COVID-19 encephalopathy.","Antony, Arun Raj; Haneef, Zulfi",Seizure,,175

All MT patients in 20/24 centres that responded were considered as COVID-19 suspicious/positive unless or until proven otherwise. Twenty-two of the 24 centres reported delays to the patient pathway. Seventeen of the 24 centres reported that the COVID-19 pandemic had reduced training opportunities for specialist registrars (SpR). Fourteen of the 24 centres reported that the pandemic had hampered their development plans for their local or regional MT service. CONCLUSION: The present survey has highlighted a trend of decreasing cases and delays in the patient pathway during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic across UK centres.","McConachie, D; McConachie, N; White, P; Crossley, R; Izzath, W",Clin Radiol,,175
237806,Reactivity of human antisera to codon optimized SARS-CoV2 viral proteins expressed in Escherichia coli,2021,"A fine-tuned activation and deactivation of proteases and their inhibitors are involved in the execution of the inflammatory response. The zymogen/proenzyme plasminogen is converted to the serine protease plasmin, a key fibrinolytic factor by plasminogen activators including tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA). Plasmin is part of an intricate protease network controlling proteins of initial hemostasis/coagulation, fibrinolytic and complement system. Activation of these protease cascades is required to mount a proper inflammatory response. Although best known for its ability to dissolve clots and cleave fibrin, recent studies point to the importance of fibrin-independent functions of plasmin during acute inflammation and inflammation resolution. In this review, we provide an up-to-date overview of the current knowledge of the enzymatic and cytokine-like effects of tPA and describe the role of tPA and plasminogen receptors in the regulation of the inflammatory response with emphasis on the cytokine storm syndrome such as observed during coronavirus disease 2019 or macrophage activation syndrome. We discuss tPA as a modulator of Toll like receptor signaling, plasmin as an activator of NFkB signaling, and summarize recent studies on the role of plasminogen receptors as controllers of the macrophage conversion into the M2 type and as mediators of efferocytosis during inflammation resolution.","Heissig, Beate; Salama, Yousef; Takahashi, Satoshi; Osada, Taro; Hattori, Koichi",Cell Signal,,175

More recent studies have shown that carotenoid supplementation provides even more skin protection than previously shown as new clinical and molecular endpoints beyond UVB-induced erythema have been reported. These recent studies have demonstrated that carotenoids also provide photoprotection against UVA-induced pigmentation and inhibit molecular markers of oxidative stress such as intercellular adhesion molecule-1, heme-oxygenase-1, matrix metalloproteinase-1, 9, and others. This article provides a comprehensive review of the published clinical evidence on skin benefits of carotenoids in the last five decades and indicates new perspectives on the role of ingestible carotenoids in skin protection.","Baswan, Sudhir M; Klosner, Allison E; Weir, Cathy; Salter-Venzon, Dawna; Gellenbeck, Kevin W; Leveret, Jesse; Krutmann, Jean",Photodermatol. photoimmunol. photomed,,175

The purpose of this document is to propose technical strategies to assist the pediatric surgeons to minimize the potential aerosolization of viral particles in COVID-19 patients undergoing urgent or emergent surgical treatment using laparoscopic approaches, based on the currently available literature. The situation and recommendations are subject to change with emerging information. Materials and Methods: The Scientific Committee and the Board of the European Society of Pediatric Endoscopic Surgeons gathered together in order to address the issue of minimally invasive surgery during this COVID-19 pandemic. A systematic search through PubMed, Embase, and World Wide Web of the terms ""COVID-19,"" ""Coronavirus,"" and ""SARS-CoV-2"" matched with ""pneumoperitoneum,"" ""laparoscopy,"" ""thoracoscopy,"" ""retroperitoneoscopy,"" and ""surgery"" was performed. Non-English language papers were excluded. A PRISMA report was performed. Criticalities were identified and a consensus was achieved over a number of key aspects. Results: We identified 121 documents. A total of 11 full-text documents were assessed to address all concerns related to the adoption of minimally invasive surgery. All aspect of pediatric minimally invasive surgery, including elective surgery, urgent surgery, laparoscopy, thoracoscopy, retroperitoneoscopy, and pneumoperitoneum creation and maintainance were extensively addressed through systematic review. A consensus regarding urgent laparoscopic procedures, setting and operation techniques was obtained within the Committee and the Board. Conclusions: The ESPES proposes the following recommendations in case minimally invasive surgery is needed in a COVID-19 positive pediatric patients: (1) consider conservative treatment whenever safely possible, (2) dedicate a theater, columns and reusable laparoscopic instrumentation to COVID-19 pediatric patients, (3) prefer disposable instrumentation and cables, (4) use low CO2 insufflation pressures, (5) use low power electrocautery, (6) prefer closed-systems CO2 insufflation and desufflation systems, and (7) avoid leaks through ports. These recommendations are subject to change with emerging information and might be amended in the near future.","Pini Prato, Alessio; Conforti, Andrea; Almstrom, Markus; Van Gemert, Wim; Scuderi, Maria G; Khen-Dunlop, Naziha; Draghici, Isabela; Mendoza-Sagaon, Mario; Giné Prades, Carlos; Chiarenza, Fabio; Steyaert, Henri",Front Pediatr,,175
241786,Extracellular vesicles derived from umbilical cord mesenchymal stromal cells alleviate pulmonary fibrosis by means of transforming growth factor-ß signaling inhibition,2021,"Multiple-choice questions (MCQs) offer the most promising avenue for skill evaluation in the era of virtual education and job recruiting, where traditional performance-based alternatives such as projects and essays have become less viable, and grading resources are constrained. The automated generation of MCQs would allow assessment creation at scale. Recent advances in natural language processing have given rise to many complex question generation methods. However, the few methods that produce deployable results in specific domains require a large amount of domain-specific training data that can be very costly to acquire. Our work provides an initial foray into MCQ generation under high data-acquisition cost scenarios by strategically emphasizing paraphrasing the question context (compared to the task). In addition to maintaining semantic similarity between the question-answer pairs, our pipeline, which we call AGenT Zero, consists of only pre-trained models and requires no fine-tuning, minimizing data acquisition costs for question generation. AGenT Zero successfully outperforms other pre-trained methods in fluency and semantic similarity. Additionally, with some small changes, our assessment pipeline can be generalized to a broader question and answer space, including short answer or fill in the blank questions.","Li, Eric; Su, Jingyi; Sheng, Hao; Wai, Lawrence",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.01186v2.pdf,175

METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of AA and Latino Hispanic patients with COVID-19 admitted to a 665-bed quaternary care, teaching hospital located in Newark, New Jersey. The study included patients who had completed hospitalization between March 10, 2020, and April 10, 2020. We reviewed demographics, socioeconomic variables and incidence of in-hospital mortality and morbidity. Logistic regression was used to identify predictor of in-hospital death. RESULTS: Out of 416 patients, 251 (60%) had completed hospitalization as of April 10, 2020. The incidence of In-hospital mortality was 38.6% (n = 97). Most common symptoms at initial presentation were dyspnea 39% (n = 162) followed by cough 38%(n = 156) and fever 34% (n = 143). Patients were in the highest quartile for population's density, number of housing units and disproportionately fell into the lowest median income quartile for the state of New Jersey.

242764,Immunity-and-matrix-regulatory cells derived from human embryonic stem cells safely and effectively treat mouse lung injury and fibrosis,2020,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2 virus) has been sustained in China since December 2019, and has become a pandemic. The mental health of frontline medical staff is a concern. In this study, we aimed to identify the factors influencing medical worker anxiety in China during the COVID-19 outbreak. We conducted a cross-sectional study to estimate the prevalence of anxiety among medical staff in China from 10 February 2020 to 20 February 2020 using the Zung Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) to assess anxiety, with the criteria of normal (â©½49), mild (50-59), moderate (60-70) and severe anxiety (â©¾70). We used multivariable linear regression to determine the factors (e.g. having direct contact when treating infected patients, being a medical staff worker from Hubei province, being a suspect case) for anxiety. We also used adjusted models to confirm independent factors for anxiety after adjusting for gender, age, education and marital status. Of 512 medical staff in China, 164 (32.03%) had had direct contact treating infected patients. The prevalence of anxiety was 12.5%, with 53 workers suffering from mild (10.35%), seven workers suffering from moderate (1.36%) and four workers suffering from severe anxiety (0.78%). After adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics (gender, age, education and marital status), medical staff who had had direct contact treating infected patients experienced higher anxiety scores than those who had not had direct contact (ß value = 2.33, confidence interval (CI) 0.65-4.00; P = 0.0068). A similar trend was observed in medical staff from Hubei province, compared with those from other parts of China (ß value = 3.67, CI 1.44-5.89; P = 0.0013). The most important variable was suspect cases with high anxiety scores, compared to non-suspect cases (ß value = 4.44, CI 1.55-7.33; P = 0.0028). In this survey of hospital medical workers during the COVID-19 outbreak in China, we found that study participants experienced anxiety symptoms, especially those who had direct clinical contact with infected patients; as did those in the worst affected areas, including Hubei province; and those who were suspect cases. Governments and healthcare authorities should proactively implement appropriate psychological intervention programmes, to prevent, alleviate or treat increased anxiety.","Liu, Chen-Yun; Yang, Yun-Zhi; Zhang, Xiao-Ming; Xu, Xinying; Dou, Qing-Li; Zhang, Wen-Wu; Cheng, Andy S K",Epidemiol Infect,,175
245578,Functional heterogeneity of mesenchymal stem cells from natural niches to culture conditions: implications for further clinical uses,2020,"Puerto Rican children comprise a historically vulnerable group that has garnered little attention from academics and policy makers.

It is imperative to understand the demographic, social, and economic patterns of Puerto Ricans in the past decade, in order to assess the true impact of the destructive 2017 hurricanes on Puerto Rican children and their families, and identify ways to address current population needs. This study fills this gap in the literature by providing recent pre-hurricane socioeconomic outcomes of Puerto Rican-origin children in Puerto Rico and the United States. It applies an origin-destination framework by relying on American Community Survey and Puerto Rico Community Survey data from 2012 to 2016.

However, understanding the patterns of risk perception could also facilitate effective risk communication to minimize the impacts of disease spread during this crisis. OBJECTIVE: We attempted to explore patterns of community health risk perceptions of COVID-19 in South Korea using Internet search data. METHODS: Google Trends (GT) and NAVER relative search volumes (RSVs) data were collected using COVID-19-related terms in the Korean language and were retrieved according to time, gender, age groups, types of device, and location. Online queries were compared to the number of daily new COVID-19 cases and tests reported in the Kaggle open-access dataset for time period of December 5, 2019 to May 31, 2020. Spearman's rank correlation coefficients were employed to assess whether correlations between new COVID-19 cases and Internet searches were affected by time. We also constructed a prediction model of new COVID-19 cases using the number of COVID-19 cases, tests, GT, and NAVER RSVs in lag periods (of 3 to 1 days). Single and multiple regressions were employed using backward elimination and a variance inflation factor (VIF) of <5. RESULTS: Numbers of COVID-19-related queries in South Korea increased during local events including local transmission, approval of coronavirus test kits, implementation of coronavirus drive-through tests, a facemask shortage, and a widespread campaign for social distancing as well as during international events such as the announcement of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the World Health Organization. Online queries were also stronger in women (r=0.763~0.823; p<0.05), and age groups of &#8804;29 (r=0.726~0.821; p<0.05), 30~44 (r=0.701~0.826; p<0.05), and &#8805;50 years (r=0.706~0.725; p<0.05). In terms of spatial distribution, GT and NAVER RSVs were higher in affected areas. Moreover, greater correlations were found in mobile searches (r=0.704~0.804; p<0.05) compared to those of desktop searches (r=0.705~0.717; p<0.05), indicating changing behaviors in searching for online health information during the outbreak. Those varied Internet searches related to COVID-19 represented community health risk perceptions. In addition, as a country with a high number of coronavirus tests, results showed that adults perceived coronavirus test-related information as being more important than disease-related knowledge. Meanwhile, younger and older age groups had different perceptions. Moreover, NAVER RSVs can potentially be used for health risk perception assessments and disease predictions. Adding COVID-19-related searches provided by NAVER could increase the performance of the model compared to that of the COVID-19 case-based model and potentially be used to predict epidemic curves. CONCLUSIONS: The use of both GT and NAVER RSVs to explore patterns of community health risk perceptions could be beneficial for targeting risk communication from several perspectives, including time, population characteristics, and location.","Husnayain, Atina; Shim, Eunha; Fuad, Anis; Su, Emily Chia-Yu",J. med. internet res,,175

By relating individual variations in antibody response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severity, beneficial antiviral immune responses may be identified in detail. In this issue of the JCI, Secchi and collaborators describe antibody response profiles in 509 patients with COVID-19 from Italy during the 2020 pandemic. The research team found that multiple antibody types to multiple SARS-CoV-2 antigens developed over four weeks. Notably, IgG against the spike receptor binding domain (RBD) was predictive of survival and IgA against the viral spike protein (S protein) associated with rapid virologic clearance. These results may help guide selection of convalescent plasma, hyperimmune products, monoclonal antibodies, and vaccine strategies for COVID-19.","Henderson, Jeffrey P",J Clin Invest,,175

247538,The Junctional Epithelium Is Maintained by a Stem Cell Population,2020,"Background: In pandemics, because of increased demand and subsequent shortage of commercial facemasks, people need to use cloth facemasks, although such masks are reported to provide reduced protection. These masks can be prepared in local levels from different fabric materials. In developing countries, cloth masks are preferable because of low cost and added advantages of reusability. The filtering performance of a cloth facemask depends on the facial fit and on the material properties of fabrics such as porosity, yarn spacing or packing, and pore size. In resource limited settings, an affordable and easy to implement method that can assess the surface properties of cloth facemask fabrics would be important. Methods: In this work, we developed a smartphone microscopic method for rapid screening of fabric quality. We measured the field of view of the microscope and as a proof of concept, we implemented the method to examine surfaces of sixteen locally available cloth mask fabrics. Results: Out of the 16 masks examined, we found very diverse yarn packing and pore morphology (pore size and shape) in the fabrics. The pore size ranged from ~80 to 720 µm; much larger than respiratory droplet and bio-aerosol. This observation partly explains why such cloth facemasks provide reduced protection to the user during pandemics. The performance of a cloth facemask partly depends on the material properties of fabric such as yarn packing, pore size, porosity. Therefore, the surface properties of fabrics obtained from the smartphone method can be used to get preliminary idea on the facemask quality. We believe that the method can be an affordable and rapid method for selection of better fabrics for cloth facemask during pandemics.","Neupane, Bhanu B; Chaudhary, Ravindra K; Sharma, Amita",PeerJ,,175

This study aimed to investigate if patients treated with hydroxychloroquine for a non-COVID-19 indication had a lower risk of verified infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) compared with matched controls. METHODS: A cohort comprising all persons in Denmark collecting hydroxychloroquine prescriptions in 2020 and 2019 (i.e., both during and before SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed in Denmark), matched by age and sex with controls, was studied. Data were collected using the Danish national registries, which contain complete information on patient health data, prescriptions and microbiological test results. The main outcome was microbiologically verified SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: In total, 5488 hydroxychloroquine users were matched with 54,486 non-users. At baseline, the groups differed in terms of diagnoses of pulmonary disease, cardiovascular disease, renal disease, gastrointestinal/metabolic disease and dementia, as well as treatment with antirheumatic drugs. The final model was adjusted for these potential confounders. Use of hydroxychloroquine for non-COVID-19 indications was not associated with any change in confirmed SARS-CoV-2 (hazard ratio 0.90, 95% confidence interval 0.76-1.07). This result was robust in the propensity-score-matched sensitivity analysis.

Since COVID-19 management differs over time, it is hard to determine which therapy is more efficacious. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of the regimen with Favipiravir (FPV) and determine if the timing of FPV addition offers any improvement. METHODS: A retrospective observational case-controlled cohort study was performed between March and September 2020, including adults with COVID-19 in a single-center in Turkey. We categorized patients into age-sex matched three groups, group 1 (n = 48) and group 2 (n = 48) included patients treated with the combination of FPV plus Hydroxychloroquine (HQ) early and late, respectively. Group 3 (n = 48) consisted of patients on HQ monotherapy. In Group 2, if the respiratory or clinic condition had not improved sufficiently, FPV was added on or after day 3. RESULTS: We found that starting FPV early had an impact on PCR negativity and the progression of the disease. 'No progression' was defined as the absence of a new finding in the control radiological examination and the absence of accompanying clinical deterioration. Also, the decrease in C-reactive protein (CRP) was greater in Group 1 than Group 3 (p < 0.001). However, we found that early initiation of FPV treatment did not have a positive effect on the estimated survival time. CONCLUSIONS: According to this retrospective study results, we believe that for better clinical outcomes, FPV treatment should be started promptly to enhance antiviral effects and improve clinical outcomes.","Ucan, Anil; Cerci, Pamir; Efe, Serdar; Akgun, Hakan; Ozmen, Ahmet; Yagmuroglu, Aysel; Bilgin, Muzaffer; Avci, Deniz",Virol J,,175

264473,Evaluation of Flavonoids as 2019-nCoV Cell Entry Inhibitor Through Molecular Docking and Pharmacological Analysis,2020,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious virus spreading all around the world. Deep learning has been adopted as an effective technique to aid COVID-19 detection and segmentation from computed tomography (CT) images. The major challenge lies in the inadequate public COVID-19 datasets. Recently, transfer learning has become a widely used technique that leverages the knowledge gained while solving one problem and applying it to a different but related problem. However, it remains unclear whether various non-COVID19 lung lesions could contribute to segmenting COVID-19 infection areas and how to better conduct this transfer procedure. This paper provides a way to understand the transferability of non-COVID19 lung lesions and a better strategy to train a robust deep learning model for COVID-19 infection segmentation. METHODS: Based on a publicly available COVID-19 CT dataset and three public non-COVID19 datasets, we evaluate four transfer learning methods using 3D U-Net as a standard encoder-decoder method. i) We introduce the multi-task learning method to get a multi-lesion pre-trained model for COVID-19 infection. ii) We propose and compare four transfer learning strategies with various performance gains and training time costs. Our proposed Hybrid-encoder Learning strategy introduces a Dedicated-encoder and an Adapted-encoder to extract COVID-19 infection features and general lung lesion features, respectively. An attention-based Selective Fusion unit is designed for dynamic feature selection and aggregation. RESULTS: Experiments show that trained with limited data, proposed Hybrid-encoder strategy based on multi-lesion pre-trained model achieves a mean DSC, NSD, Sensitivity, F1-score, Accuracy and MCC of 0.704, 0.735, 0.682, 0.707, 0.994 and 0.716, respectively, with better genetalization and lower over-fitting risks for segmenting COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSIONS: The results reveal the benefits of transferring knowledge from non-COVID19 lung lesions, and learning from multiple lung lesion datasets can extract more general features, leading to accurate and robust pre-trained models. We further show the capability of the encoder to learn feature representations of lung lesions, which improves segmentation accuracy and facilitates training convergence. In addition, our proposed Hybrid-encoder learning method incorporates transferred lung lesion features from non-COVID19 datasets effectively and achieves significant improvement. These findings promote new insights into transfer learning for COVID-19 CT image segmentation, which can also be further generalized to other medical tasks.","Wang, Yixin; Zhang, Yao; Liu, Yang; Tian, Jiang; Zhong, Cheng; Shi, Zhongchao; Zhang, Yang; He, Zhiqiang",Comput Methods Programs Biomed,,175

264524,The Weight of Obesity in Immunity from Influenza to COVID-19,2021,"STATEMENT: The dramatic outbreak of COVID-19 placed unprecedented strain on the critical care workforce of New York City. The enhanced precautions required to safely care for COVID-19 patients impacted the performance of even routine critical care procedures. Meanwhile, staff were stretched to care for exponentially rising case volume as COVID intensive care units (ICUs) expanded. Simulation was used to bridge these gaps-first to familiarize personnel within the Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care with revised COVID-19 care procedures, then to orient noncritical care clinicians volunteering from other specialties for COVID ICU deployment to general critical care and COVID-19 care principles. Using mannequin-based simulation scenarios followed by comprehensive debriefing sessions, simulation participants received high-intensity, high-fidelity training in respiratory failure, circulatory failure, bedside ultrasound, bedside ICU procedures, and elements of COVID-19-specific care. More than 200 physicians and advanced practice practitioners completed simulation training in preparation for deployment, supplementing and enhancing the ICU workforce at a decisive time during the outbreak.","Nair, Sunil S; Kaufman, Brian",Simul Healthc,,175

METHODS: The study was planned prospectively. The study included 63 male patients over 40 years of age diagnosed with COVID-19. The patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 based on the results of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction tests of oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swabs obtained as per the World Health Organization guidelines. The presence of LUTS was assessed by the International Prostate Symptom Score (I-PSS), a subjective assessment, and the I-PSS was filled for the patients included in the study. The patients were divided into three groups based on their scores in the I-PSS survey: group 1: mild (0-7), group 2: moderate (8-19), and group 3: severe (20-35). The data of all three groups were statistically analyzed. RESULTS: In the assessment performed between the groups, it was identified that for patients in group 3, the length of hospital stay was longer, intensive care requirement was more frequent, and their mortality rates were numerically higher. In the evaluation made regarding the time to intensive care admittance, this was identified to be the shortest in group 3. CONCLUSION: As a result of our study, we think that in patients with COVID-19, BPH-related LUTS can guide clinicians in predicting prognosis.","Karabulut, Ibrahim; Cinislioglu, Ahmet Emre; Cinislioglu, Nazan; Yilmazel, Fatih Kursat; Utlu, Mustafa; Alay, Handan; Celik, Erkan Cem; Adanur, Senol",Urol Int,,175

Several studies have been conducted on attitudes of the public towards COVID-19 vaccines and the potential influencing factors. The purpose of this scoping review is to summarize the data available on the various factors influencing public attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccination. This scoping review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) Statement. PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central were searched without restrictions to reclaim all publications on the factors that shape individuals’ attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccines from 1 January 2020 to 15 February 2021. Fifty studies were included. The scoping review revealed that the factors influencing public attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccines were embedded within the different levels of the socio-ecological model. These factors included the sociodemographic characteristics of the individuals, individual factors, social and organizational factors. In addition, certain characteristics of COVID-19 vaccines themselves influenced public attitudes towards accepting the vaccines. Understanding various population needs and the factors shaping public attitudes towards the vaccines would support planning for evidence-based multilevel interventions in order to enhance global vaccine uptake.","Al-Jayyousi, Ghadir Fakhri Sherbash Mohamed Abdelhady Mabrouk Ali Lamees Abdullah Mohammed El-Heneidy Asmaa Alhussaini Nour Waleed Zuhair Elhassan Manar Elsheikh Abdelrahman Nazzal Maisa Ayman",Vaccines,,175
266123,The possible impact of SARS-COV-2 on neglected tropical diseases in Europe: the out of spotlights emerging of schistosomiasis,2021,"Computed Tomography (CT) plays an important role in monitoring radiation-induced Pulmonary Fibrosis (PF), where accurate segmentation of the PF lesions is highly desired for diagnosis and treatment follow-up. However, the task is challenged by ambiguous boundary, irregular shape, various position and size of the lesions, as well as the difficulty in acquiring a large set of annotated volumetric images for training. To overcome these problems, we propose a novel convolutional neural network called PF-Net and incorporate it into a semi-supervised learning framework based on Iterative Confidence-based Refinement And Weighting of pseudo Labels (I-CRAWL). Our PF-Net combines 2D and 3D convolutions to deal with CT volumes with large inter-slice spacing, and uses multi-scale guided dense attention to segment complex PF lesions. For semi-supervised learning, our I-CRAWL employs pixel-level uncertainty-based confidence-aware refinement to improve the accuracy of pseudo labels of unannotated images, and uses image-level uncertainty for confidence-based image weighting to suppress low-quality pseudo labels in an iterative training process. Extensive experiments with CT scans of Rhesus Macaques with radiation-induced PF showed that: 1) PF-Net achieved higher segmentation accuracy than existing 2D, 3D and 2.5D neural networks, and 2) I-CRAWL outperformed state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning methods for the PF lesion segmentation task. Our method has a potential to improve the diagnosis of PF and clinical assessment of side effects of radiotherapy for lung cancers.","Wang, Guotai; Zhai, Shuwei; Lasio, Giovanni; Zhang, Baoshe; Yi, Byong; Chen, Shifeng; Macvittie, Thomas J.; Metaxas, Dimitris; Zhou, Jinghao; Zhang, Shaoting",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.14172v1.pdf,175

271044,"Preying on Public Fears and Anxieties in a Pandemic: Businesses Selling Unproven and Unlicensed ""Stem Cell Treatments"" for COVID-19",2020,"This work investigates the feasibility of estimating the parameters of an exact transverse isotropy model in cortical bone. The model describes the anisotropy of the velocity of compressional and shear bulk elastic waves. We propose to achieve this with ultrasound imaging relying on the transmission of unfocused beams and with an autofocus method. The latter is based on the principle that the reconstructed ultrasound image shows optimal quality if the velocity model is correct. The autofocus approach is applied to a composite image of the interface between cortical bone and marrow. It is obtained by incoherent summation of 4 types of images exploiting 4 different ray paths in the cortical bone layer, 3 of them involving mode-converted shear waves. If the parameters of the model are correct, spatial co-localization of the interface appears in the four images. As a result, intensity and sharpness in the composite image are maximal. The five parameters of the model of transverse isotropy are successfully estimated in a tube made of a bone-mimicking material. The estimates are in good agreement with resonant ultrasound spectroscopy measurements. The tube thickness is recovered with an error smaller than 0.3%.In vivoresults at the forearm of a volunteer are promising, four parameters could be estimated and are in good agreement withex vivoresonant ultrasound spectroscopy measurements. Moreover X-ray peripheral computed tomography corroborates the thickness of the cortical bone layer in the ultrasound image. Weak-anisotropy and exact transverse isotropy models provide very close measurements of the thickness of the tube and the radius bone. Thus, we recommend using the model of weak transverse isotropy for real-time anatomical imaging because more computationally efficient. For material characterization however, the model of exact transverse isotropy is preferred because the elastic anisotropy of cortical bone is moderate, rather than weak.","Renaud, Guillaume; Clouzet, Pierre; Cassereau, Didier; Talmant, Maryline",Phys. med. biol,,175

280701,SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) Vaccine Development and Production: An Ethical Way Forward,2020,"Introduction: Organizing pneumonia is a histologic subsect of interstitial lung disease (ILD). While a non-specific reaction to lung injury, it can be associated with infection, autoimmunity, or medication toxicity, or be characterized as idiopathic. Association with COVID-19 infection remains under active investigation. Beyond the initial viremia seen in COVID-19, the subsequent phase, characterized by an over-active host immune response, is less well understood. Anti-melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) antibodies have been implicated in autoimmune pathology, including dermatomyositis and rapidly progressive ILD, and found to be positive in some patients with COVID-19. We describe a case of rapidly progressive organizing pneumonia with anti-MDA5 positivity, perhaps precipitated by earlier COVID-19 infection. Case: A 70-year-old gentleman with history of COVID-19 infection several months earlier presented with subacute dyspnea. He had not required hospitalization for COVID-19 infection, but subsequently developed slowly progressive dyspnea, wheezing, and inflammatory, migratory polyarthritis. Outpatient management with oral methylprednisolone 32mg daily, improved his arthritis, however, his respiratory symptoms did not improve despite additional inhaled corticosteroids and beta agonists. Admission imaging showed new bilateral upper lobe predominant ground glass opacities, reticulation of peripheral interstitium and bronchiectasis (Figure 1). Infectious workup, including SARS-CoV-2 testing, was negative. Rheumatologic workup revealed positive rheumatoid factor, anti-nuclear antibody (1:160, diffuse pattern) and anti-MDA5 antibody. The patient received broad spectrum antimicrobials and diuresis, but developed worsening acute hypoxemic/hypercarbic respiratory failure, requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation, proning, and neuromuscular blockade. Pulse dose steroids with intravenous methylprednisolone 250mg every six hours, were trialed for several days without improvements. Video assisted thorascopic surgery was performed and biopsy revealed bronchiolitis obliterans and organizing pneumonia with areas of fibrosis, without hyaline membrane formation or visible micro-organisms. The patient was not a candidate for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and by the time the aforementioned biopsy resulted, he transitioned to comfort focused care, and died. Post-mortem examination revealed progression to diffuse alveolar damage with hyaline membrane formation, foci of early fibroplasia and squamous metaplasia and organizing parenchymal scars. Discussion: Anti-MDA5 antibody positivity has been implicated in rapidly progressive ILD often refractory to conventional treatments like steroids. While this patient's pathology showed organizing pneumonia, there was unfortunately no improvement with steroids. This case, of a patient with prior COVID-19 infection, who subsequently presented with rapidly progressive ILD in the setting of anti-MDA5 antibody, raises concern for viral-mediated autoimmune ILD. This highlights the urgency to understand SARS-CoV-2's interaction with the host immune response and subsequent autoantibody development.","McNamara, L.; Brady, V.

Key findings included the observation that pre-COVID mental health disparities predispose LGBTQ+ people to poorer outcomes; that technological communication aids are essential in maintaining some sense of community; and that substance use is perceived by sexual minority women as a means of coping with fears, stress, loneliness, and boredom. Studies in this special issue also document that community support is still a critical need, particularly among those who are sheltering at home with families of origin. Findings underscore the importance of addressing structural inequities, including advocating for rights; providing financial support for LGBTQ+ community organizations and networks; ensuring access to competent and affirming healthcare; and including vulnerable communities in disaster response and planning.","Drabble, Laurie A; Eliason, Michele J",J Homosex,,175

286768,MacroH2A1.2 deficiency leads to neural stem cell differentiation defects and autism-like behaviors,2021,"An increasing body of evidence suggests a protective effect of some psychoactive substances against SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus type 2). Recent findings suggest that patients with psychiatric disorders are less affected by SARS-CoV-2 than their caregivers, which may seem surprising given some of the frequent risk factors for an unfavorable course of the disease (e.g., obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases). We propose here a mixed pharmacoepidemiological and pharmacochemical hypothesis to explain these findings. A number of psychotropic drugs exhibit activities against coronaviruses (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-1) and the Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV)) and have been put forward as potentially anti-SARS-CoV-2. These treatments include numerous mee-too drugs (chemically and pharmacologically linked to those which have demonstrated anti-SARS-CoV-2 efficacy) which are frequently prescribed in psychiatric settings. Taken alone or in polypharmacy, these drugs could have a prophylactic anti-SARS-CoV-2 effect, explaining the unexpectedly low proportion of patients with psychiatric disorders and COVID-19. Associated factors such as nicotine can also be considered in the context of a broad chemoprophylactic hypothesis in patients with psychiatric disorders taking different psychoactive substances.","Javelot, Hervé; Petrignet, Julien; Addiego, Frédéric; Briet, Jeanne; Solis, Morgane; El-Hage, Wissam; Hingray, Coraline; Weiner, Luisa",Med.

287210,Advances in mesenchymal stem cell therapy for immune and inflammatory diseases: Use of cell-free products and human pluripotent stem cell-derived mesenchymal stem cells,2021,"OBJECTIVE: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease that was first reported in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and has since spread rapidly around the world, resulting in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The CHA2DS2-VASc score is a well-validated risk stratification tool for predicting stroke in atrial fibrillation (AFib), as well as morbidity and mortality in several entities. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between the CHA2DS2-VASc score and in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19, regardless of AFib. METHODS: This multicenter, retrospective study included a total of 349 patients with COVID-19 who were hospitalized between March 15 and April 15, 2020. The CHA2DS2-VASc score of each patient was calculated. Mortality outcomes were followed up until April 25, 2020. RESULTS: The CHA2DS2-VASc score was significantly higher in non-survivor COVID-19 patients than in survivor COVID-19 patients (p<0.001). Forward stepwise logistic regression analysis demonstrated that a CHA2DS2-VASc score of &#8805;3 (odds ratio [OR]: 12.613, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.092-51.451; p<0.001), and the leukocyte count (OR: 1.327, 95% CI: 1.145-1.538; p<0.001), C-reactive protein level (OR: 1.010, 95% CI: 1.002-1.018; p=0.012), and ferritin level (OR: 1.005, 95% CI: 1.003-1.007; p<0.001) on admission were independent predictors of in-hospital mortality of COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSION: The CHA2DS2-VASc score predicted in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19, regardless of AFib.","Quisi, Alaa; Alici, Gökhan; Harbalioglu, Hazar; Genç, Ömer; Er, Fahri; Allahverdiyev, Samir; Yildirim, Abdullah; Kurt, Ibrahim Halil",Turk Kardiyol Dern Ars,,175

288277,Multifaceted Role of AMPK in Viral Infections,2021,"The clinical features of COVID-19 have a considerable range from a mild illness to severe disease. Underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of the rapidly progressive, and often fatal, pulmonary disease frequently observed in COVID-19 need to be elucidated, in order to develop new treatment strategies for different disease endotypes. Fatal cases can display features of a cytokine storm, which may be related to hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. Also, a spectrum of vascular changes, including microvascular damage, is known to accompany severe COVID-19. In this paper, we describe the co-occurrence of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and extensive pulmonary microvascular damage with thrombosis and its sequelae in a patient with fatal COVID-19. We believe these response patterns may be linked by common mechanisms involving hypercytokinemia and require further investigation as a fatal constellation in COVID-19, to generate appropriate treatment in patients who display these combined features.","von der Thüsen, Jan H; van Bommel, Jasper; Kros, Johan M; Verdijk, Robert M; Lopuhaä, Boaz; Lam, King H; Dik, Willem A; Miedema, Jelle R",J Hematop,,175

In addition, the use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in such children may have a protective effect on the cardiovascular system. Methods: Cross-sectional study of randomly selected eighty HIV infected and 80 aged matched non- HIV-infected children were used. HIV-infected children were on HAART for more than 5years and had steadily received the treatment for 6 months prior to the time of the tests. Heights and weights were measured and body mass index calculated. Cardiac indices evaluated were heart rate (HR), PR interval, QRS duration, QT/QTC Interval, P/QRS/T Axis, RV5/SV1 voltage and RV5+SV1 voltage. Results: The average heart rate was significantly higher among HIV infected children on HAART than their non-infected counterparts (P= 0.019). At 0.05 significance level, their PR interval was significantly higher than those in the control group (P=0.050). The average QRS duration result also showed a significant difference between that of test and control subjects (P = 0.022). Conclusion: The HAART usage possibly improved the cardiovascular functioning in the infected children but the protective effects diminish with increase age and longer exposure.","Eleazar, Emeka Spiff; Eleazar, Clara Idara; Nwachukwu, Daniel Chukwu; Nwagha, Uchenna Ifeanyi",Afr Health Sci,,175

RESULTS: Cough and fever were started 18 days ago and his PCR test was resulted positive for COVID-19 infection. After treatment and quarantine were completed, he developed sudden leg weakness following autonomic features. Cerebrospinal fluid was suggestive for GBS despite the electrodiagnostic test was not helpful because it was done in the first days. He recovered without needing any immunotherapy. CONCLUSION: Our case suggested that COVID-19 can cause atypical benign GBS forms in addition to well-known variants. Comprehensive studies are needed to describe the unknowns and determine the exact prevalence of GBS after COVID-19 infection, including mild cases that did not require hospital admission.","Türk Börü, Ülkü; Köseoglu Toksoy, Cansu; Bölük, Cem; Demirbas, Hayri; Yilmaz, Ahmet Çagdas",Int J Neurosci,,175

The disease began in Wuhan, Hubei province in China and since then it has spread quickly to many countries all over the world. COVID-19 is caused by a novel coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus was majorly seen to overwhelm the respiratory system with mild to severe acute respiratory syndrome considered pathognomic for the disease. However, with time a plethora of symptoms was observed in the patients infected with COVID-19 including strong evidence for neurological symptoms. Evidence suggests that the virus has both central and peripheral nervous system manifestations. Patients, particularly those who suffer from a severe illness, have a central nervous system (CNS) involvement and neurological manifestations. There is precise and targeted documentation of neurological symptoms with details of clinical, neurological, and electrophysiological findings.

We survey the history and mechanism of coronaviruses, and the structural characteristics of the spike protein and its key residues responsible for human transmissions. METHODS: We have carried out a systematic review to summarize the origin, transmission and etiology of COVID-19. The structural analysis of the spike protein and its disordered residues explains the mechanism of the viral transmission. A meta-data analysis of the therapeutic compounds targeting the SARS-CoV-2 is also included. RESULTS: Coronaviruses can cross the species barrier and infect humans with unexpected consequences for public health. The transmission rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection is higher compared to that of the closely related SARS-CoV infections. In SARS-CoV-2 infection, intrinsically disordered regions are observed at the interface of the spike protein and ACE2 receptor, providing a shape complementarity to the complex. The key residues of the spike protein have stronger binding affinity with ACE2. These can be probable reasons for the higher transmission rate of SARS-CoV-2. In addition, we have also discussed the therapeutic compounds and the vaccines to target SARS-CoV-2, which can help researchers to develop effective drugs/vaccines for COVID-19. The overall history and mechanism of entry of SARS-CoV-2 along with structural study of spike-ACE2 complex provide insights to understand disease pathogenesis and development of vaccines and drugs.","Yesudhas, Dhanusha; Srivastava, Ambuj; Gromiha, M Michael",Infection,,175

This study aimed at investigating the genomic variation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Taiwan and compared their evolutionary trajectories with the global strains. We performed culture and full-genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 strains followed by phylogenetic analysis. A 382-nucleotides deletion in open reading frame 8 (ORF8) was found in a Taiwanese strain isolated from a patient on February 4, 2020 who had a travel history to Wuhan. Patients in the first wave also included several sporadic, local transmission cases. Genomes of 5 strains sequenced from clustered infections were classified into a new clade with ORF1ab-V378I mutation, in addition to 3 dominant clades ORF8-L84S, ORF3a-G251V and S-D614G. This highlighted clade also included some strains isolated from patients who had a travel history to Turkey and Iran. The second wave mostly resulted from patients who had a travel history to Europe and Americas. All Taiwanese viruses were classified into various clades. Genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in Taiwan revealed a new ORF8-deletion mutant and a virus clade that may be associated with infections in the Middle East, which contributed to a better understanding of the global SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics.","Gong, Yu-Nong; Tsao, Kuo-Chien; Hsiao, Mei-Jen; Huang, Chung-Guei; Huang, Peng-Nien; Huang, Po-Wei; Lee, Kuo-Ming; Liu, Yi-Chun; Yang, Shu-Li; Kuo, Rei-Lin; Chen, Kuan-Fu; Liu, Yen-Chin; Huang, Sheng-Yu; Huang, Hsing-I; Liu, Ming-Tsan; Yang, Ji-Rong; Chiu, Cheng-Hsun; Yang, Cheng-Ta; Chen, Guang-Wu; Shih, Shin-Ru",Emerg Microbes Infect,,175

However, language generation models' democratization also makes it easier to generate human-like text at-scale for nefarious activities, from spreading misinformation to targeting specific groups with hate speech. Thus, it is essential to understand how people interact with bots and develop methods to detect bot-generated text. This paper shows that bot-generated text detection methods are more robust across datasets and models if we use information about how people respond to it rather than using the bot's text directly. We also analyze linguistic alignment, providing insight into differences between human-human and human-bot conversations.","Bhatt, Paras; Rios, Anthony",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.01170v1.pdf,175

The lack of an efficient pharmacological treatments are serious problems to be faced by scientists and medical staffs worldwide. In this work, an in silico approach based on the combination of molecular docking, dynamics simulations, and quantum biochemistry revealed that the synthetic peptides RcAlb-PepI, PepGAT, and PepKAA, strongly interact with the main protease (Mpro) a pivotal protein for SARS-CoV-2 replication. Although not binding to the proteolytic site of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, RcAlb-PepI, PepGAT, and PepKAA interact with other protein domain and allosterically altered the protease topology. Indeed, such peptide-SARS-CoV-2 Mpro complexes provoked dramatic alterations in the three-dimensional structure of Mpro leading to area and volume shrinkage of the proteolytic site, which could affect the protease activity and thus the virus replication. Based on these findings, it is suggested that RcAlb-PepI, PepGAT, and PepKAA could interfere with SARS-CoV-2 Mpro role in vivo. Also, unlike other antiviral drugs, these peptides have no toxicity to human cells. This pioneering in silico investigation opens up opportunity for further in vivo research on these peptides, towards discovering new drugs and entirely new perspectives to treat COVID-19.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

While coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) research has primarily emphasized virological, clinical, and epidemiological perspectives, crucial aspects of the pandemic are fundamentally ecological or evolutionary. Here, we highlight five conceptual domains of ecology and evolution - invasion, consumer-resource interactions, spatial ecology, diversity, and adaptation - that illuminate (sometimes unexpectedly) the emergence and spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We describe the applications of these concepts across levels of biological organization and spatial scales, including within individual hosts, host populations, and multispecies communities. Together, these perspectives illustrate the integrative power of ecological and evolutionary ideas and highlight the benefits of interdisciplinary thinking for understanding emerging viruses.","Snedden, Celine E; Makanani, Sara K; Schwartz, Shawn T; Gamble, Amandine; Blakey, Rachel V; Borremans, Benny; Helman, Sarah K; Espericueta, Luisa; Valencia, Alondra; Endo, Andrew; Alfaro, Michael E; Lloyd-Smith, James O",Trends microbiol,,175

Moreover, other out-ofhospital spaces have been transformed into hospitalization units to absorb the large number of patients that had to be treated and isolated. To guarantee the distribution of medicines and the quality of the pharmaceutical care, drug distribution systems, such as unit dose and automated dispensing systems, have undergone transformations. Standard stocks were assigned for COVID units, and different dispensing circuits to avoid the risk of cross-contamination between COVID and non-COVID units were created, as well as disinfection protocols for medication transport systems and medication return protocols. All this without forgetting COVID treatment protocol's changes that were affected by the availability of the drugs. The increase in the number of beds in out-of-hospital spaces, such as field hospitals, hotels, socio-medical centers and nursing homes, has challenged Pharmacy Services, since new medication dispensing and conciliation circuits have been created forcing the increase of pharmacy staff's presence and modifying work shifts, to afford all the new tasks successfully.

Here we report high coverage whole genome sequencing of 76 unrelated individuals, from 27 indigenous groups across Mexico, with more than 97% average Native American ancestry. On average, each individual has 3.26 million Single Nucleotide Variants and short indels, that together comprise a catalog of 9,737,152 variants, 44,118 of which are novel. We report 497 common Single Nucleotide Variants (with allele frequency > 5%) mapped to drug responses and 316,577 in enhancer or promoter elements; interestingly we found some of these enhancer variants in PPARG, a nuclear receptor involved in highly prevalent health problems in Mexican population, such as obesity, diabetes, and insulin resistance. By detecting signals of positive selection we report 24 enriched key pathways under selection, most of them related to immune mechanisms. No missense variants in ACE2, the receptor responsible for the entry of the SARS CoV-2 virus, were found in any individual. Population genomics and phylogenetic analyses demonstrated stratification in a Northern-Central-Southern axis, with major substructure in the Central region. The Seri, a northern group with the most genetic divergence in our study, showed a distinctive genomic context with the most novel variants, and the most population specific genotypes. Genome-wide analysis showed that the average haplotype blocks are longer in Native Mexicans than in other world populations.

331813,Development and validation of a novel immunogenicity assay to detect anti-drug and anti-PEG antibodies simultaneously with high sensitivity,2020,"The COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic underwent a rapid transition with the emergence of a dominant viral variant (from the ""D-form"" to the ""G-form"") that carried an amino acid substitution D614G in its ""Spike"" protein. The G-form is more infectious in vitro and is associated with increased viral loads in the upper airways. To gain insight into the molecular-level underpinnings of these characteristics, we used microsecond all-atom simulations. We show that changes in the protein energetics favor a higher population of infection-capable states in the G-form through release of asymmetry present in the D-form inter-protomer interactions. Thus, the increased infectivity of the G-form is likely due to a higher rate of profitable binding encounters with the host receptor. It is also predicted to be more neutralization sensitive owing to enhanced exposure of the receptor binding domain, a key target region for neutralizing antibodies. These results are critical for vaccine design.","Mansbach, Rachael A; Chakraborty, Srirupa; Nguyen, Kien; Montefiori, David C; Korber, Bette; Gnanakaran, S",Sci. Adv,,175

However, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 has not been detected in the human eye to date. We undertook this study to analyze the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in human post-mortem ocular tissues. METHODS: The expression of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was assessed by RT-PCR in corneal and scleral tissues from 33 surgical-intended donors who were eliminated from a surgical use per Eye Bank Association of America (EBAA) donor screening guidelines or medical director review or positive COVID-19 test. Ocular levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA (RT-PCR), Envelope and Spike proteins (immunohistochemistry) and anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies (ELISA) in blood were evaluated in additional 10 research-intent COVID-19 positive donors. FINDINGS: Of 132 ocular tissues from 33 surgical-intended donors, the positivity rate for SARS-CoV-2 RNA was ~13% (17/132). Of 10 COVID-19 donors, six had PCR positive post-mortem nasopharyngeal swabs whereas eight exhibited positive post-mortem anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels. Among 20 eyes recovered from 10 COVID-19 donors: three conjunctival, one anterior corneal, five posterior corneal, and three vitreous swabs tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. SARS-CoV-2 spike and envelope proteins were detected in epithelial layer of the corneas that were procured without Povidone-Iodine (PVP-I) disinfection. INTERPRETATIONS: Our study showed a small but noteworthy prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in ocular tissues from COVID-19 donors. These findings underscore the criticality of donor screening guidelines, post-mortem nasopharyngeal PCR testing and PVP-I disinfection protocol to eliminate any tissue harboring SARS-CoV-2 being used for corneal transplantation.","Sawant, Onkar B; Singh, Sneha; Wright, Robert Emery; Jones, Kayla M; Titus, Michael S; Dennis, Eugene; Hicks, Eric; Majmudar, Parag A; Kumar, Ashok; Mian, Shahzad I",Ocular surf,,175

344641,Mesenchymal Stem Cell-based Therapy for COVID-19: Possibility and Potential,2020,"The development of a safe and effective vaccine is a key requirement to overcoming the COVID-19 pandemic. Recombinant proteins represent the most reliable and safe vaccine approach but generally require a suitable adjuvant for robust and durable immunity. We used the SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequence and in silico structural modelling to design a recombinant spike protein vaccine (Covax-19). A synthetic gene encoding the spike extracellular domain (ECD) was inserted into a baculovirus backbone to express the protein in insect cell cultures. The spike ECD was formulated with Advax-SM adjuvant and first tested for immunogenicity in C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice. The Advax-SM adjuvanted vaccine induced high titers of binding antibody against spike protein that were able to neutralise the original wildtype virus on which the vaccine was based as well as the variant B.1.1.7 lineage virus. The Covax-19 vaccine also induced potent spike-specific CD4+ and CD8+ memory T-cells with a dominant Th1 phenotype, and this was shown to be associated with cytotoxic T lymphocyte killing of spike labelled target cells in vivo. Ferrets immunised with Covax-19 vaccine intramuscularly twice 2 weeks apart made spike receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG and were protected against an intranasal challenge with SARS-CoV-2 virus 2 weeks after the second immunisation. Notably, ferrets that received two 25 or 50g doses of Covax-19 vaccine had no detectable virus in their lungs or in nasal washes at day 3 post-challenge, suggesting the possibility that Covax-19 vaccine may in addition to protection against lung infection also have the potential to block virus transmission. This data supports advancement of Covax-19 vaccine into human clinical trials.","Li, Lei; Honda-Okubo, Yoshikazu; Huang, Ying; Jang, Hyesun; Carlock, Michael A; Baldwin, Jeremy; Piplani, Sakshi; Bebin-Blackwell, Anne G; Forgacs, David; Sakamoto, Kaori; Stella, Alberto; Turville, Stuart; Chataway, Tim; Colella, Alex; Triccas, Jamie; Ross, Ted; Petrovsky, Nikolai",,,175
346300,An integrative look at SARS­CoV­2 (Review),2021,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused severe disruptions in care for many patients. A key question is whether the landscape of clinical research has also changed. METHODS: In a retrospective cohort study, we examined the association of the COVID-19 outbreak with new clinical trial activations. Trial data for all interventional and observational oncology, cardiovascular, and mental health studies from January 2015 through September 2020 were obtained from ClinicalTrials.gov . An interrupted time-series analysis with Poisson regression was used. RESULTS: We examined 62,252 trial activations. During the initial COVID-19 outbreak (February 2020 through May 2020), model-estimated monthly trial activations for US-based studies were only 57% of the expected estimate had the pandemic not occurred (relative risk = 0.57, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.61, p < .001). For non-US-based studies, the impact of the pandemic was less dramatic (relative risk = 0.77, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.82, p < .001), resulting in an overall 27% reduction in the relative risk of new trial activations for US-based trials compared to non-US-based trials (relative risk ratio = 0.73, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.81, p < .001). Although a rebound occurred in the initial reopening phase (June 2020 through September 2020), the rebound was weaker for US-based studies compared to non-US-based studies (relative risk ratio = 0.87, 95% CI 0.80 to 0.95, p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: These findings are consistent with the disproportionate burden of COVID-19 diagnoses and deaths during the initial phase of the pandemic in the USA. Reduced activation of cancer clinical trials will likely slow the pace of clinical research and new drug discovery, with long-term negative consequences for cancer patients. An important question is whether the renewed outbreak period of winter 2020/2021 will have a similarly negative impact on the initiation of new clinical research studies for non-COVID-19 diseases.","Unger, Joseph M; Xiao, Hong",Trials,,175

In adults, Acetylsalicylic Acid (ASA) is widely employed at low doses for primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Apart their anti-thrombotic effect, low ASA doses also exert an anti-inflammatory action. So, when these are assumed for CVD prevention, could prevent both inflammatory reaction and pro-coagulant tendency of Coronavirus-2019 (COVID-19) infection. In addition, some patients receiving ASA are simultaneously treated with Statins, to correct dyslipidemia. But, for their pleiotropic effects, Statins can also be useful to antagonize pulmonary thrombo-inflammation induced by COVID-19. Thus ASA, with or without Statins, employed for CVD prevention, could be useful to avoid or minimize inflammatory reaction and thrombotic complications of COVID-19. But, further studies performed in a wide range are requested to validate this hypothesis.","Cacciapuoti, F.",Clinical &amp; Applied Thrombosis/Hemostasis,,175

Personal protective equipment (PPE) is recommended to minimize contact with critical patients with COVID-19 infection. This study aimed to primarily examine the effect of PPE use on intubation time and success rate among prehospital healthcare professionals; additionally, we compared intubation times among prehospital health care professionals using PPE with direct laryngoscopy and video laryngoscopy assistance. METHODS: In this prospective simulation study, we compared the intubation times and success rates among prehospital healthcare professionals who were or were not using PPE. Furthermore, demographic data, previous intubation experience, and previous intubation experience with PPE were recorded. RESULTS: Overall time to intubation with PPE use was 51.28â¯±â¯3.89â¯s, which was significantly higher than that without PPE use (33.03â¯±â¯2.65â¯s; pâ¯<â¯0.001). In addition, the overall success rate with PPE use was 74.4%, which was significantly lower than that without PPE use (93%;pâ¯<â¯0.001). PPE use increased the average intubation time by 19.73â¯±â¯2.59â¯s with direct laryngoscopy and by 16.81â¯±â¯2.86â¯s with video laryngoscopy (pâ¯<â¯0.001). CONCLUSIONS: PPE use is associated with increased intubation time and decreased success rate. Video laryngoscopy assistance in cases where PPE use is required facilitates faster endotracheal intubation than does direct laryngoscopy assistance.","Çaglar, Ahmet; Kaçer, Ilker; Hacimustafaoglu, Muhammet; Öztürk, Berkant; Öztürk, Sema",Australas.

Methods: During February 5(th) to 10(th), 2020, a national anonymous survey was conducted using an online questionnaire among PLHIV at least 18 years of age and had started antiretroviral treatment (ART) to collect the information on COVID-19 prevention, HIV-related health services and the needs on psychosocial support. Current status and needs of people living with HIV were analyzed in Hubei and other regions. Results: A total of 1 014 valid questionnaires were collected, with PLHIV respondents cross the country. The survey revealed that 93.79% of the respondents could obtain information regarding the prevention of COVID-19 from their communities or villages. Respondents were concerned with HIV-specific protective measures and personal protective equipment shortage. 32.64% of all respondents were not carrying sufficient antiretroviral medicines (ARVs) to meet the needs under traffic and travel restrictions, and some could face stock-outs in the coming month. In Hubei province where 53 respondents needed ARV refill, 64.15% reported difficulty accessing ARV due to the ""blockage"" . 28.93% respondents were in need of sociopsychological support, and 85.31% anticipated further improvement of the out-of-town ARV refill process from the government. Conclusion: PLHIV wants to know HIV-specific protective measures against COVID-19 outbreak. PLHIV who returned to their home-towns and affected by the lock-downs reported challenges with refills. We should undertake a more systematic study on impacts of the COVID-19 on PLHIV to develop preparedness capacity for future public health emergency.","Guo, W; Weng, H L; Bai, H; Liu, J; Wei, X N; Zhou, K; Sande, A",Zhonghua Liu Xing Bing Xue Za Zhi,,175
352606,Novel coronavirus and the central nervous system,2020,"Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) encoded by IGHV3-53 (VH3-53) targeting the spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) have been isolated from different COVID-19 patients. However, the existence and prevalence of shared VH3-53-encoded antibodies in the antibody repertoires is not clear. Using antibody repertoire sequencing, we found that the usage of VH3-53 increased after SARS-CoV-2 infection. A highly shared VH3-53-J6 clonotype was identified in 9 out of 13 COVID-19 patients. This clonotype was derived from convergent gene rearrangements with few somatic hypermutations and was evolutionary conserved. We synthesized 34 repertoire-deduced novel VH3-53-J6 heavy chains and paired with a common IGKV1-9 light chain to produce recombinant mAbs. Most of these recombinant mAbs (23/34) possess RBD binding and virus-neutralizing activities, and recognize ACE2 binding site via the same molecular interface. Our computational analysis, validated by laboratory experiments, revealed that VH3-53 antibodies targeting RBD are commonly present in COVID-19 patients' antibody repertoires, indicating many people have germline-like precursor sequences to rapidly generate SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies. Moreover, antigen-specific mAbs can be digitally obtained through antibody repertoire sequencing and computational analysis.","Yan, Qihong; He, Ping; Huang, Xiaohan; Luo, Kun; Zhang, Yudi; Yi, Haisu; Wang, Qian; Li, Feng; Hou, Ruitian; Fan, Xiaodi; Li, Pingchao; Liu, Xinglong; Liang, Huan; Deng, Yijun; Chen, Zhaoming; Chen, Yunfei; Mo, Xiaoneng; Feng, Liqiang; Xiong, Xiaoli; Li, Song; Han, Jian; Qu, Linbing; Niu, Xuefeng; Chen, Ling",Emerg Microbes Infect,,175
352709,Retrospective Validation of a Metagenomic Sequencing Protocol for Combined Detection of RNA and DNA Viruses Using Respiratory Samples from Pediatric Patients,2020,"Objective: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has altered the provision of health care, including interfacility transport of critically ill neonatal and pediatrics patients. Transport medicine faces unique challenges in the care of persons infected with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. In particular, the multitude of providers, confined spaces for prolonged time periods, varying modes (ground, rotor wing, and fixed wing) of transport, and the need for frequent aerosol-generating procedures place transport personnel at high risk. This study describes the clinical practices, personal protective equipment, and potential exposure risks of a large cohort of neonatal and pediatric interfacility transport teams. Methods: Data for this study came from a survey distributed to members of the American Academy of Pediatrics Section on Transport Medicine. Results: Fifty-four teams responded, and 47 reported transporting COVID-19–positive patients. Among the 47 teams, 25% indicated having at least 1 team member convert to COVID-19 positive. A small percentage of teams (40% ground, 40% fixed wing, and 18% rotor wing) reported allowing parental accompaniment during transport. There was no difference in teams with a positive team member among those that do (26%) and do not (25%) allow parents. There was a higher percentage of teams with a positive team member among teams that intubate (32% vs. 0%) and place laryngeal mask airways (34% vs. 0%) during transport. Conclusion: Our study shows that exceptional care during interfacility transport, including a family-centered approach, can continue during the COVID-19 pandemic. Teams must take steps to protect themselves, as well as the patients and families they serve, in order to mitigate the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.","Stroud, M. H.; Miquel-Verges, F.

With the increasing requirement of detection for SARS-CoV-2 outside of the laboratory setting, a rapid and precise Point of Care Test (POCT) is urgently needed. Methods: Targeting the nucleocapsid (N) gene of SARS-CoV-2, specific primers, and probes for reverse transcription recombinase-aided amplification coupled with lateral flow dipstick (RT-RAA/LFD) platform were designed. For specificity evaluation, it was tested with human coronaviruses, human influenza A virus, influenza B viruses, respiratory syncytial virus, and hepatitis B virus, respectively. For sensitivity assay, it was estimated by templates of recombinant plasmid and pseudovirus of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. For clinical assessment, 100 clinical samples (13 positive and 87 negatives for SARS-CoV-2) were tested via quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) and RT-RAA/LFD, respectively. Results: The limit of detection was 1 copies/µl in RT-RAA/LFD assay, which could be conducted within 30 min at 39°C, without any cross-reaction with other human coronaviruses and clinical respiratory pathogens. Compared with RT-qPCR, the established POCT assay offered 100% specificity and 100% sensitivity in the detection of clinical samples. Conclusion: This work provides a convenient POCT tool for rapid screening, diagnosis, and monitoring of suspected patients in SARS-CoV-2 endemic areas.","Zheng, Yu-Zhong; Chen, Jiang-Tao; Li, Jian; Wu, Xian-Jing; Wen, Jin-Zhou; Liu, Xiang-Zhi; Lin, Li-Yun; Liang, Xue-Yan; Huang, Hui-Ying; Zha, Guang-Cai; Yang, Pei-Kui; Li, Lie-Jun; Zhong, Tian-Yu; Liu, Long; Cheng, Wei-Jia; Song, Xiao-Nan; Lin, Min",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,,175

While much work has targeted treatment effect estimation from observational data, there is relatively little work in the setting of confounding variable missingness, where collecting more information on confounders is often costly or time-consuming. In this work, we frame this challenge as a problem of feature acquisition of confounding features for causal inference. Our goal is to prioritize acquiring values for a fixed and known subset of missing confounders in samples that lead to efficient average treatment effect estimation. We propose two acquisition strategies based on i) covariate balancing (CB), and ii) reducing statistical estimation error on observed factual outcome error (OE). We compare CB and OE on five common causal effect estimation methods, and demonstrate improved sample efficiency of OE over baseline methods under various settings. We also provide visualizations for further analysis on the difference between our proposed methods.","Wang, Shirly; Yi, Seung Eun; Joshi, Shalmali; Ghassemi, Marzyeh",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.08753v1.pdf,175

Remdesivir (GS-5734), a nucleoside analogue prodrug, has inhibitory effects on pathogenic animal and human coronaviruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in vitro, and inhibits Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, SARS-CoV-1, and SARS-CoV-2 replication in animal models. METHODS: We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial at ten hospitals in Hubei, China. Eligible patients were adults (aged &#8805;18 years) admitted to hospital with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, with an interval from symptom onset to enrolment of 12 days or less, oxygen saturation of 94% or less on room air or a ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen of 300 mm Hg or less, and radiologically confirmed pneumonia. Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to intravenous remdesivir (200 mg on day 1 followed by 100 mg on days 2-10 in single daily infusions) or the same volume of placebo infusions for 10 days. Patients were permitted concomitant use of lopinavir-ritonavir, interferons, and corticosteroids. The primary endpoint was time to clinical improvement up to day 28, defined as the time (in days) from randomisation to the point of a decline of two levels on a six-point ordinal scale of clinical status (from 1=discharged to 6=death) or discharged alive from hospital, whichever came first. Primary analysis was done in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population and safety analysis was done in all patients who started their assigned treatment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04257656. FINDINGS: Between Feb 6, 2020, and March 12, 2020, 237 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to a treatment group (158 to remdesivir and 79 to placebo); one patient in the placebo group who withdrew after randomisation was not included in the ITT population. Remdesivir use was not associated with a difference in time to clinical improvement (hazard ratio 1·23 [95% CI 0·87-1·75]). Although not statistically significant, patients receiving remdesivir had a numerically faster time to clinical improvement than those receiving placebo among patients with symptom duration of 10 days or less (hazard ratio 1·52 [0·95-2·43]). Adverse events were reported in 102 (66%) of 155 remdesivir recipients versus 50 (64%) of 78 placebo recipients. Remdesivir was stopped early because of adverse events in 18 (12%) patients versus four (5%) patients who stopped placebo early. INTERPRETATION: In this study of adult patients admitted to hospital for severe COVID-19, remdesivir was not associated with statistically significant clinical benefits. However, the numerical reduction in time to clinical improvement in those treated earlier requires confirmation in larger studies.

The strain CHN-JS-2017 was isolated and identified by cytopathology, immunofluorescence assays, transmission electron microscopy, and sequence analysis. A nucleotide sequence alignment showed that the whole genome of CHN-JS-2017 is 97.4%-99.6% identical to other PDCoV strains. The pathogenicity of the CHN-JS-2017 strain was investigated in orally inoculated five-day-old piglets; the piglets developed acute, watery diarrhea, but all recovered and survived. CHN-JS-2017 infection-induced microscopic lesions were observed, and viral antigens were detected mainly by immunohistochemical staining in the small intestine. The neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) and polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR) are crucial immunoglobulin (Ig) receptors for the transcytosis ofimmunoglobulin G (IgG), IgA, or IgM. Importantly, CHN-JS-2017 infected five-day-old piglets could significantly down-regulate the expression of FcRn, pIgR, and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-&#954;B)in the intestinal mucosa. Note that the level of FcRn mRNA in the intestinal mucosa of normal piglets is positively correlated with pIgR and NF-&#954;B.

Protein precipitation as sample preparation, without the need of a time-consuming deglucuronidation step for the quantification of 1-hydroxymidazolam glucuronide, resulted in a simple and rapid assay suitable for clinical practice with a total runtime of only 1.1 min. The four components and the isotope-labeled internal standards were separated on a C18 column and detection was performed with a triple-stage quadrupole mass spectrometer operating in positive ionization mode. The method was validated based on the ""Guidance for Industry Bioanalytical Method Validation"" (Food and Drug Administration, FDA) and the ""Guideline on bioanalytical method validation"" of the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Linearity was proven over the ranges of 5-1500 µg/L for midazolam, 1-hydroxymidazolam and 4-hydroxymidazolam and 25-5000 µg/L for 1-hydroxymidazolam glucuronide, using a sample volume of 100 µL. Matrix comparison indicated that the assay is also applicable to other human matrices like EDTA and heparin plasma and urine. Stability experiments showed good results for the stability of midazolam, 1-hydroxymidazolam and 1-hydroxymidazolam glucuronide in serum, EDTA and heparin plasma and urine stored for 7 days under different conditions. At room temperature, 4-hydroxymidazo-lam is stable for 7 days in EDTA plasma, but stable for only 3 days in serum and heparin plasma and less than 24 h in urine. All four compounds were found to be stable in serum, EDTA plasma, heparin plasma and urine for 7 days after sample preparation and for 3 freeze-thaw cycles. The assay has been applied in therapeutic drug monitoring of midazolam for (pediatric) intensive care patients.","Wessels, A Mireille A; Bolhuis, Mathieu S; Bult, Wouter; Nijsten, Maarten W N; Kneyber, Martin C J; Touw, Daan J",J Chromatogr B Analyt Technol Biomed Life Sci,,175
374996,"Human Mesenchymal Stem Cells: The Present Alternative for High-Incidence Diseases, Even SARS-Cov-2",2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic presents unprecedented challenges and uncertainties for families. Guided by uncertainty management theory, this study qualitatively explored mothers’ sources of COVID-related uncertainties for their older children and the strategies used to manage their uncertainties. Twenty-five mothers in the U.S. Midwest were interviewed by telephone between March-May 2020 during the early pandemic months. Data indicated four sources of uncertainty: adjustment, threat of COVID-19, COVID-19 information, and social interaction. Protective behaviors used to manage threat of COVID-19 uncertainties (e.g., social distancing and isolation) sometimes unleashed further uncertainties about social interactions with others that mothers were still attempting to manage. The findings suggest theoretical implications of uncertainty management theory as it applies to COVID-19 and practical implications for empowering mothers with tools for support and health literacy skills to understand and act on credible COVID-19 information.

376430,The conundrum of current anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines,2021,"BACKGROUND: To determine the diagnostic value of hematologic markers for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and explore their relationship with disease severity. METHODS: Subjects included 190 COVID-19 patients, 190 healthy subjects, and 105 influenza pneumonia (IP) patients. COVID-19 patients were divided into the ARDS and non-ARDS groups. Routine blood examination, biochemistry indicator, days in hospital, body temperature, pneumonia severity index (PSI), CURB-65, and MuLBSTA were recorded. Correlations between variables were assessed using Spearman's correlation analysis. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to study the accuracy of the various diagnostic tests. RESULTS: Compared with healthy subjects, COVID-19 patients had lower white blood cell (WBC), lymphocyte, platelet, and hemoglobin levels; higher percentages of neutrophils and monocytes; lower percentages of lymphocytes and higher neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (MLR), and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) values (P < .05). COVID-19 patients had higher WBC and neutrophil levels and lower percentages of lymphocytes compared to IP (P < .05). ROC curve analysis revealed that MLR had a high diagnostic value in differentiating COVID-19 patients from healthy subjects, but not from IP patients. NLR showed significant positive correlations with PSI, CURB-65, and MuLBSTA. Lymphocyte count was lower in the ARDS group and yielded a higher diagnostic value than the other variables. CONCLUSIONS: Monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio showed an acceptable efficiency to separate COVID-19 patients from healthy subjects, but failed to rule out IP patients. NLR may be a reliable marker to evaluate the disease severity of COVID-19. Lymphocyte count may be useful to establish the early diagnosis of ARDS in the COVID-19 patients.","Peng, Junnan; Qi, Di; Yuan, Guodan; Deng, Xinyu; Mei, Ying; Feng, Longhua; Wang, Daoxin",J Clin Lab Anal,,175

Compared to traditional energy- and area-hungry deep learning methods, SNNs are significantly more energy efficient and can be deployed in the growing number of compact SNN accelerator chips, making them a better solution for ubiquitous IoT applications. We propose a novel SNN strategy for radar gesture recognition, achieving more than 91% of accuracy on two different radar datasets. Our work significantly differs from previous approaches as 1) we use a novel radar-SNN training strategy, 2) we use quantized weights, enabling power-efficient implementation in real-world SNN hardware, and 3) we report the SNN energy consumption per classification, clearly demonstrating the real-world feasibility and power savings induced by SNN-based radar processing.

384784,Prediction of Sepsis in COVID-19 Using Laboratory Indicators,2020,"introduction: No proven drug and no immunisation are yet available for COVID-19 disease. The SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro), a key coronavirus enzyme, which is a potential drug target, has been successfully crystallised. There is evidence suggesting that statins exert anti-viral activity and may block the infectivity of enveloped viruses. The aim of this study was to assess whether statins are potential COVID-19 Mpro inhibitors, using a molecular docking study. Material and methods: Molecular docking was performed using AutoDock/ Vina, a computational docking program. SARS-CoV-2 Mpro was docked with all statins, while antiviral and antiretroviral drugs - favipiravir, nelfinavir, and lopinavir - were used as standards for comparison. Results: The binding energies obtained from the docking of 6LU7 with native ligand favipiravir, nelfinavir, lopinavir, simvastatin, rosuvastatin, pravastatin, pitavastatin, lovastatin, fluvastatin, and atorvastatin were -6.8, -5.8, -7.9, -7.9, -7.0, -7.7, -6.6, -8.2, -7.4, -7.7, and -6.8 kcal/mol, respectively. The number of hydrogen bonds between statins and amino acid residues of Mpro were 7, 4, and 3 for rosuvastatin, pravastatin, and atorvastatin, respectively, while other statins had two hydrogen bonds. Conclusions: These results indicate, based upon the binding energy of pitavastatin, rosuvastatin, lovastatin, and fluvastatin, that statins could be efficient SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors. This is supported by the fact that the effects of some statins, especially pitavastatin, have a binding energy that is even greater than that of protease or polymerase inhibitors. However, further research is necessary to investigate their potential use as drugs for COVID-19.","Reiner, Željko; Hatamipour, Mahdi; Banach, Maciej; Pirro, Matteo; Al-Rasadi, Khalid; Jamialahmadi, Tannaz; Radenkovic, Dina; Montecucco, Fabrizio; Sahebkar, Amirhossein",Arch.

385363,"SARS, SARS again, and MERS. Review of animal models of human respiratory syndromes caused by coronavirus infections",2020,"Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has become an increasingly challenging problem throughout the world. Because of the numerous potential modes of transmission, surgeons and all procedural staff represent a unique population that requires standardized procedures to protect themselves and their patients. Although several protocols have been implemented during other infectious disease outbreaks, such as Ebola virus, no standardized protocol has been published in regard to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A multidisciplinary team of two surgeons, an anesthesiologist, and an infection preventionist was assembled to create a process with sterile attire adapted from the National Emerging Special Pathogen Training and Education Center (NETEC) donning and doffing process. After editing, a donning procedure and doffing procedure was created and made into checklists. The procedures were simulated in an empty operating room (OR) with simulation of all personnel roles. A ""dofficer"" role was established to ensure real-time adherence to the procedures. Results: The donning and doffing procedures were printed as one-page documents for easy posting in ORs and procedural areas. Pictures from the simulation were also obtained and made into flow chart-style diagrams that were also posted in the ORs. Conclusions: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a quickly evolving pandemic that has spread all over the globe. With the rapid increase of infections and the increasing number of severely ill individuals, healthcare providers need easy-to-follow guidelines to keep themselves and patients as safe as possible. The processes for donning and doffing personal protective equipment (PPE) presented here provide an added measure of safety to surgeons and support staff to provide quality surgical care to positive and suspected COVID-19-positive patients.","Evans, Heather L; Thomas, Christopher S; Bell, L Hannah; Hink, Ashley B; O039,; Driscoll, Stephanie; Tobin, Catherine D; Salgado, Cassandra D",Surg Infect (Larchmt),,175

OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to assess the change in children's and adolescents' prevention and vaccination behaviors amid China's COVID-19 epidemic. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional online survey in mid-March 2020 using proportional quota sampling in Wuhan (the epidemic epicenter) and Shanghai (a nonepicenter). Data were collected from 1655 parents with children aged 3 to 17 years. Children's and adolescents' prevention behaviors and regular vaccination behaviors before and during the epidemic were assessed. Descriptive analyses were used to investigate respondents' characteristics, public health prevention behaviors, unproven protection behaviors, and vaccination behaviors before and during the COVID-19 epidemic. Univariate analyses were performed to compare differences in outcome measures between cities and family characteristics, using chi-square tests or Fisher exact tests (if expected frequency was <5) and analyses of variance. Multivariate logistic regressions were used to identify the factors and disparities associated with prevention and vaccination behaviors. RESULTS: Parent-reported prevention behaviors increased among children and adolescents during the COVID-19 epidemic compared with those before the epidemic. During the epidemic, 82.2% (638/776) of children or adolescents always wore masks when going out compared with 31.5% (521/1655) before the epidemic; in addition, 25.0% (414/1655) and 79.8% (1321/1655) had increased their frequency and duration of handwashing, respectively, although only 46.9% (776/1655) went out during the epidemic. Meanwhile, 56.1% (928/1655) of the families took unproven remedies against COVID-19. Parent-reported vaccination behaviors showed mixed results, with 74.8% (468/626) delaying scheduled vaccinations and 80.9% (1339/1655) planning to have their children get the influenza vaccination after the epidemic. Regarding socioeconomic status, children and adolescents from larger families and whose parents had lower education levels were less likely to improve prevention behaviors but more likely to take unproven remedies. Girls were less likely than boys to always wear a mask when going out and wash their hands. CONCLUSIONS: Prevention behaviors and attitudes toward influenza vaccination have improved during the COVID-19 epidemic. Public health prevention measures should be continuously promoted, particularly among girls, parents with lower education levels, and larger families. Meanwhile, misinformation about COVID-19 remains a serious challenge and needs to be addressed by public health stakeholders.","Hou, Zhiyuan; Song, Suhang; Du, Fanxing; Shi, Lu; Zhang, Donglan; Lin, Leesa; Yu, Hongjie",JMIR Public Health Surveill,,175

We investigated the effect of COVID-19 infection and quarantine on seizure frequency in adult people with epilepsy (PwE) of Apulia and Basilicata regions, Southern Italy. METHODS: This is an observational, retrospective study based on prospective data collection of 102 successive PWE. The frequency of seizures was evaluated during pre-quarantine (January- February), quarantine (March-April), and post-quarantine period (May-June), while PwE were divided into A) cases responding to treatment with &#8804; 1 seizure per year; B) cases responding to treatment with 2-5 seizure per year; C) cases with drug-resistant epilepsy with &#8804; 4 seizures per month; D) cases with drug-resistant epilepsy with 5-10 seizures per month. PwE underwent several self-report questionnaires regarding therapeutic compliance, mood, stress and sleep during quarantine period. RESULTS: Approximately 50 % of PwE showed seizure frequency changes (22.55 % an increase and 27.45 % a reduction) during quarantine. Seizure frequency significantly (p < 0.05) increased in PwE responding to treatment with &#8804; 1 seizure per year, while significantly (p < 0.05) reduced in PwE with drug-resistant epilepsy with 5-10 seizures per month. The data was not influenced by therapeutic adherence, sleep and depression. The analysis of anxiety showed a moderate level of anxiety in PwE responding to treatment with < 1 seizure per year, while moderate stress was perceived by all PwE. Seizure frequency changes were related to quarantine, but not to COVID-19 infection. In fact, unlike other regions of Italy, particularly Northern Italy, Apulia and Basilicata regions were less affected by COVID-19 infection, and almost all PwE recognized the quarantine as a stressful event. Emotional distress and anxiety due to social isolation, but also the relative reduction of triggers for epileptic seizures were the most important factors for changes in seizure frequency. CONCLUSIONS: Our study adds to the growing concern that the indirect effects of COVID-19 pandemic will far outstrip the direct consequences of the infection.","d039,; Orsi, Giuseppe; Mazzeo, Francesca; Ravidà, Domenico; Di Claudio, Maria Teresa; Sabetta, Annarita; Lalla, Alessandra; Sbrizzi, Stefania; Avolio, Carlo",Clin Neurol Neurosurg,,175

The disease is showing alarming trends with the number of people getting infected with this disease, new cases and death rate are all highlighting the need to control this disease at the earliest. The strategy now for the governments around the globe is how to limit the spread of the virus until the research community develops treatment/drug or vaccination against the virus. The outbreak of this disease has unsurprisingly led to huge volume of research within a short period of time surrounding this disease. It has also led to aggressive social media activity on twitter, Facebook, dedicated blogs, news reports and other online sites actively involved in discussing about the various aspects of and related to this disease. It becomes a useful and challenging exercise to draw from this huge volume of research, the key papers that form the research front, its influence in the research community, and other important research insights.

410962,Stem cells and COVID-19: are the human amniotic cells a new hope for therapies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus?,2021,"Deployment of optical network infrastructure and network services is growing exponentially for beyond 5G networks. Since the uptake of e-commerce and e-services has seen unprecedented serge in recent months due to the global COVID-19 pandemic era, the security of such transactions in optical communication has gained much importance. Optical fiber communication networks are vulnerable to several types of security threats, such as single point failure, wormhole attacks, and sybil attacks. Therefore, blockchain is a promising solution to protect confidential information against attacks and helps in achieving trusted network architecture by creating a distributed ledger platform. Recently, blockchain has received much attention because of its decentralized and distributed ledger technology. Hence, blockchain has also been employed to protect network against such attacks. However, blockchain technology's security relies on the platform of computational complexity, and because of the evolution of quantum computers, it will become insecure in the near future. Therefore, for enhancing blockchain security, research focus on combining quantum key distribution (QKD) with blockchain. This new technology is known as quantum-secured blockchain. The article describes the attacks in optical networks and provides a solution to protect network against security attacks by employing quantum-secured blockchain in optical networks. It provides a brief overview of blockchain technology with its security loopholes and focuses on QKD, which makes blockchain technology more robust against quantum-attacks. Next, the article provides a broad view of quantum-secured blockchain and presents the network architecture for future research and development of secure and trusted optical communication networks using quantum-secured blockchain.","Sharma, Purva; Bhatia, Vimal; Prakash, Shashi",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.10663v1.pdf,175

411849,Mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets of hyperinflammatory responses in SARS-CoV2,2020,"BACKGROUND: A novel coronavirus called SARS-Cov-2, which shared 82% similarity of genome sequence with SARS-CoV, was found in Wuhan in late December of 2019, causing an epidemic outbreak of novel coronavirus-induced pneumonia with dramatically increasing number of cases. Several organs are vulnerable to COVID-19 infection. Acute kidney injury (AKI) was reported in parts of case-studies reporting characteristics of COVID-19 patients. This study aimed at analyzing the potential route of SARS-Cov-2 entry and mechanism at cellular level. METHOD: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology was used to obtain evidence of potential route and ACE2 expressing cell in renal system for underlying pathogenesis of kidney injury caused by COVID-19. The whole process was performed under R with Seurat packages. Canonical marker genes were used to annotate different types of cells. RESULTS: Ten different clusters were identified and ACE2 was mainly expressed in proximal tubule and glomerular parietal epithelial cells. From Gene Ontology (GO) & KEGG enrichment analysis, imbalance of ACE2 expression, renin-angiotensin system (RAS) activation, and neutrophil-related processes were the main issue of COVID-19 leading kidney injury. CONCLUSION: Our study provided the cellular evidence that SARS-Cov-2 invaded human kidney tissue via proximal convoluted tubule, proximal tubule, proximal straight tubule cells, and glomerular parietal cells by means of ACE2-related pathway and used their cellular protease TMPRSS2 for priming.","He, Qiyu; Mok, Tsz N; Yun, Liang; He, Chengbo; Li, Jieruo; Pan, Jinghua",Mol Genet Genomic Med,,175

Gamification is very important because it helps students to represent their study contents and enrich their experiences of higher education when learning in-person is unavailable during the Covid-19 period. This study seeks to present an Android-based gamification app to evaluate the effect of using gamification and e-quizzes on college students' learning. We used the visual blocks language from the MIT App Inventor platform to develop an application, available at (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=appinventor.ai_mekomerofofo.projectGamification). The participants were students from level 2 who used digital lessons for learning MATLAB. The study included gamified learning and non-gamified learning, both integrated into lesson plans, to investigate the differences in learners' performance. Two types of quizzes were used for instruction: gamified e-quizzes and paper-based quizzes. The outcomes plainly showed that using the new gamified e-quiz was more effective than using paper-based quizzes. They are better for assessing the learning performance of the students in question, specifically in terms of formative assessment. It is very important for instructors to apply games as a modern and innovation-oriented tool through which students can be engaged in an attractive, competitive experience.","Areed, Marwa F; Amasha, Mohamed A; Abougalala, Rania A; Alkhalaf, Salem; Khairy, Dalia",Educ Inf Technol (Dordr),,175

The aim of this study is to understand the spatial spread of COVID. In this paper, we have analyzed the dynamics of COVID-19 and epidemiological characteristics by SIRD model fitting and the accuracy is assessed using RMSLE. Also, geospatial mapping of the COVID cases over the districts of Tamil Nadu is made. In our study, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery is used and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is calculated to estimate the forest canopy. The correlation between the MODIS derived data for forest cover and the COVID cases is analyzed and mapped. Urban density is an important factor in the spread of disease. Transmission occurs at a rapid phase where the population density is high. Regression analysis and the correlation between demography and transmission rate of COVID is analyzed and mapped geospatially. Basic reproduction number helps us estimate the severity of the outbreak of COVID. The basic reproduction number ${\mathbb{R}_0}$ is calculated for all the districts. Demographic factors show stronger correlation with transmission rate of COVID with ρ= 0.58 for India and =0.988 for Tamil Nadu. Forest cover shows weaker correlation with ρ=-0.083 for India and ρ=-0.159 for Tamil Nadu.

Accordingly, research on why people increasingly doubt science and endorse “alternative facts” is flourishing. Much of this work has focused on identifying cognitive biases and individual differences. Importantly, however, the reasons that lead people to question mainstream scientific findings and share misinformation are also inherently tied to social processes that emerge out of divisive commitments to group identities and worldviews. In this special issue, we focus on the important and thus far neglected role of group processes in motivating science skepticism. The articles that feature in this special issue cover three core areas: the group-based roots of antiscience attitudes;the intergroup dynamics between science and conspiratorial thinking;and finally, insights about science denial related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Across all articles, we highlight the role of worldviews, identities, norms, religion, and other inter- and intragroup processes that shape antiscientific attitudes.

426117,"To screen, or not to screen for SARS-CoV2",2020,"OBJECTIVES: In many countries around the world, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in health services being diverted to manage patients with the condition. There are situations however that still require the undertaking of aerosol generating procedures (AGP) with potentially high exposure of healthcare workers to SARS-CoV-2 transmission through droplet, contact and possibly airborne routes. The objective of this paper is to explore a structured way for the operative team to approach AGP to reduce aerosolisation of secretions, decrease open airway time and minimise staff exposure. METHODS: The authors (otolaryngologists, anaesthetists and nursing staff) created a unified operative team checklist based on collation of national and international specialty society statements, local state government recommendations, hospital policies and literature review. Simulation was undertaken and the checklist was refined after performing AGP on patients with unknown (presumed positive) COVID-19 status. RESULTS: An 8 step operative team checklist is provided describing details for the immediate pre-operative, intra-operative and post-operative journey of the patient to encourage healthcare workers to reflect upon and modify usual practice during AGP to mitigate exposure to SARS-CoV-2. The example of paediatric laryngo-bronchoscopy for diagnostic purposes or retrieval of an inhaled airway foreign body is used to illustrate the steps however the checklist structure is modifiable for other AGP and adaptable for local needs. CONCLUSIONS: At a time of overwhelming and changing information and recommendations, an operative team checklist may provide some structure to healthcare workers undertaking AGP to reduce anxiety, maintain focus, prompt consideration of alternatives and potentially reduce risk.","Soma, Marlene; Jacobson, Ian; Brewer, Jessica; Blondin, Angela; Davidson, Gretel; Singham, Shamani",Int J Pediatr Otorhinolaryngol,,175
427906,COVID-19: Lung-Centric Immunothrombosis,2021,"Children and adolescents are susceptible to the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemic and tend to show posttraumatic distress. Immediately after an epidemic, governments and social organizations often provide psychological services for children and adolescents to relieve their distress. However, many adolescents report distress even long after a traumatic event because of the unaddressed traumatic atmosphere in schools or families. To advance this issue, this article proposes a cooperative model of psychological services provision for children and adolescents in response to the COVID-19 epidemic. This model suggests that psychological services should simultaneously include social, school, and family systems, which interact and have a synergistic effect. The social system provides direct services not only for children and adolescents but also for their school and family systems; school and family systems cooperate to support adolescents. Psychological work also needs to emphasize the key elements of school and family systems. Attention should be given to teachers' distress, teacher-student relationships, and peer relationships in the school system, as well as to parents' distress, parent-child relationships, and the marital relationship in the family system. In these ways, adolescents can achieve an efficient and sustainable recovery following a disaster.

429641,Lowering the transmission and spread of human coronavirus,2020,"COVID-19 is spreading worldwide at disturbing rates, overwhelming global healthcare. Mounting death cases due to disease complications highlight the necessity of describing efficient drug therapy strategies for severe patients. COVID-19 severity associates with hypercoagulation and exacerbated inflammation, both influenced by ACE2 downregulation and cytokine storm occurrence. In this review, we discuss the applicability of the anticoagulant heparin and the anti-inflammatory corticosteroid dexamethasone for managing severe COVID-19 patients. The upregulated inflammation and blood clotting may be mitigated by administrating heparin and its derivatives. Heparin enhances the anticoagulant property of anti-thrombin (AT) and may be useful in conjunction with fibrinolytic drugs for severe COVID-19 patients. Besides, heparin can also modulate immune responses, alleviating TNF-alpha-mediated inflammation, impairing IL-6 production and secretion, and binding to complement proteins and leukotriene B4 (LTB4). Moreover, heparin may present anti-SARS-CoV-2 potential once it can impact viral infectivity and alter SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein architecture. Another feasible approach is the administration of the glucocorticoid dexamethasone. Although glucocorticoid's administration for viral infection managing is controversial, there is increasing evidence demonstrating that dexamethasone treatment is capable of drastically diminishing the death rate of patients presenting with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) that required invasive mechanical ventilation. Importantly, dexamethasone may be detrimental by impairing viral clearance and inducing hyperglycemia and sodium retention, hence possibly being deleterious for diabetics and hypertensive patients, two major COVID-19 risk groups. Therefore, while heparin's multitarget capacity shows to be strongly beneficial for severe COVID-19 patients, dexamethasone should be carefully administered taking into consideration underlying medical conditions and COVID-19 disease severity. Therefore, we suggest that the multitarget impact of heparin as an anti-viral, antithrombotic and anti-inflammatory drug in the early stage of the COVID-19 could significantly reduce the need for dexamethasone treatment in the initial phase of this disease. If the standard treatment of heparins fails on protecting against severe illness, dexamethasone must be applied as a potent anti-inflammatory shutting-down the uncontrolled and exacerbated inflammation.","Braz-de-Melo, H.

433287,Scaling of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in Settled Solids from Multiple Wastewater Treatment Plants to Compare Incidence Rates of Laboratory-Confirmed COVID-19 in Their Sewersheds,2021,"Background During the COVID-19 pandemic, in-person cadaveric dissection to teach anatomy was often omitted. While knowledge-based assessment can be evaluated via remote exams, soft skills (e.g., reflections on the topic of death) can often be overlooked. This study aims to quantitatively investigate how different anatomy course formats play a role in initiating students? reflections on life's passing, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method In the fall semester of 2020, 216 medical, dental, premedical undergraduate, and health sciences students from 14 international universities discussed (in small groups) differences in their anatomy courses as part of an online exchange program. Formats of anatomy education delivery in the 14 universities ranged from dissection, hybrid dissection-prosection, and prosection only, to no laboratory exposure during the pandemic. Students? responses to the question, ?Did/does your Anatomy course initiate your thinking on life's passing?? were collected utilizing a multiple-choice question and a short essay. Statistical analysis was performed using Chi-square analysis. Results 105 students dissected (group 1), 21 had a hybrid dissection-prosection class (group 2), and 79 had no dissection (group 3). 11 students did not have an anatomy course. Within the 3 groups, 149 students had exposure to human anatomical specimens and 52 students did not. A majority of students in groups 1 and 2 reported that the anatomy course helped them to initiate reflections on the topic of death, compared to those in group 3 (75% and 71% respectively, versus 36%, p&lt;0.05). The majority of students who had exposure to human anatomical specimens thought that the course did initiate thoughts about life's passing, compared to students who did not have this exposure (p&lt;0.05). Students who did not dissect during the time of the pandemic felt that talking with their peers who did dissect during this period (i.e., at schools that did offer dissection) resulted in initiating thoughts about the topic of death. Discussion Anatomy dissection courses and exposure to human anatomical specimens help initiate reflection on the topic of life's passing. During the COVID-19 pandemic interactions between students who do not dissect and their peers who do dissect help initiate thoughts about the topic of death in the non-dissecting students, as reflected by their essays. Without exposure to human bodies there is less chance that students will think about this subject. Conclusion Anatomy dissection courses are important for the initiation of students? feelings about the topic of death. During the COVID-19 pandemic, dissecting students can help non-dissecting students with initiating reflections about life's passing by discussing this subject with each other.","Wu, Anette Utomo Rachel Gill Sagoo Mandeep Wingate Richard Brassett Cecilia Chien Chung-Liang Traxler Hannes Waschke Jens Vielmuth Franziska Sakurai Takeshi Zeroual Mina Olsen Jorgen El Batti Salma Viranta-Kovanen Suvi Yamada Yukari McWatt Sean Kitahara Shuji Keay Kevin Kellett Anne Skonieczny Michael Mao Yinghui Lang Ariella Kunzel Carol Bernd Paulette Kielstein Heike Noel Geoffroy",The FASEB Journal,,175

Twenty-four patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of the Ezhou Central Hospital from February 1 to March 22, 2020. According to the 28-day prognosis, they were assigned to a death group and a survival group. On the 3rd day of ICU admission, peripheral blood and alveolar lavage fluid were collected for examination of lymphocyte subsets and inflammatory factors by flow cytometry and immunoturbidimetry, respectively. The CD3+ , CD4+ , and CD8+ cell counts in alveolar lavage fluid and serum were significantly higher in the survival group than those of the death group (p < .05). The levels of IL-6, HS-CRP, and PCT in the alveolar lavage fluid and serum of the death group were statistically higher than those of the survival group (p < .05); The CD3+ , CD4+ cell count, and IL-6 level were negatively correlated with Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores, respectively (p < .05). The CD4+ cell and SOFA score have a regression relationship for the prognosis of COVID-19 severe patients. The CD3+ , CD4+ , CD8+ cells, and IL-6 levels are valuable in determining the prognosis of severe COVID-19 pneumonia and are strongly correlated with the severity of the disease; the CD4+ cell is an independent risk factor affecting the prognosis of COVID-19 pneumonia.","Liao, Liang; Yang, Guo-Hui",J Med Virol,,175

Conversely, passively using SNSs is negatively associated with well-being by fostering upward social comparison and envy. However, the majority of these studies has focused on Facebook. The present research examined the relationships between well-being-satisfaction with life, negative affect, positive affect-and using actively or passively various SNSs-Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, TikTok-during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, two mediators were tested: social support and upward social comparison. One thousand four persons completed an online survey during the quarantine measures; the analyses employed structural equation modeling. Results showed that passive usage of Facebook is negatively related to well-being through upward social comparison, whereas active usage of Instagram is positively related to satisfaction with life and negative affect through social support. Furthermore, active usage of Twitter was positively related to satisfaction with life through social support; while passive usage was negatively related to upward social comparison, which, in turn, was associated with more negative affect. Finally, TikTok use was not associated with well-being. Results are discussed in line with SNSs' architectures and users' motivations.

Here, we present a stochastic model that examines this problem. In our model, people are allowed to move between discrete positions on a one-dimensional grid with viral infection possible when two people are collocated at the same site. Our model features three sets of adjustable parameters, which characterize (i) viral transmission, (ii) viral detection, and (iii) degree of personal mobility, and as such, it is able to provide a qualitative assessment of the potential for second-wave infection outbreaks based on the timing, extent, and pattern of the lockdown relaxation strategies. Our results suggest that a full lockdown will yield the lowest number of infections (as anticipated) but we also found that when personal mobility exceeded a critical level, infections increased, quickly reaching a plateau that depended solely on the population density. Confinement was not effective if not accompanied by a detection/quarantine capacity surpassing 40% of the symptomatic patients. Finally, taking action to ensure a viral transmission probability of less than 0.4, which, in real life, may mean actions such as social distancing or mask-wearing, could be as effective as a soft lockdown.","Ando, Shiho; Matsuzawa, Yuki; Tsurui, Hiromichi; Mizutani, Tetsuya; Hall, Damien; Kuroda, Yutaka",Sci Rep,,175

These viruses are mainly responsible for causing serious respiratory tract infections which generally appear initially as the common cold and can be lethal just like SARS-CoV. The problems seem to vary and worsen from one person to another depending on age, gender, ethnicity, blood groups, host genetics, and associated comorbidities. Complications should also arise as this virus keeps mutating and evolving. This review points out the various underlying causes behind the severity of the illness and the mechanisms associated with it. This review will help society to understand the risks and severities associated with COVID-19. Individuals with health complexities and predispositions listed in this review are the most vulnerable in terms of severity and should take every possible measure to protect themselves from getting infected. As a consequence, this will lead to a decrease in mortality rates arising from COVID-19.","Bidisha, Ghosh Soumyadev Sarkar Nayim Sepay Kaustuv Das Sukhen Das Dastidar S. G.",SciMedicine Journal,,175

In addition to shortages, qualitative fit testing can have low sensitivity for detecting poor fit, leading to inconsistent protection. Multiple groups have developed alternative solutions such as modified snorkel masks to overcome these limitations, but validation of these solutions has been lacking. We sought to determine if N95s and snorkel masks with attached high-efficiency filters provide consistent protection levels in healthcare workers and if the addition of positive pressure via an inexpensive powered-air purifying respirator to the snorkel mask would provide enhanced protection. Fifty-one healthcare workers who were qualitatively fitted with N95 masks underwent quantitative mask fit testing according to a simulated workplace exercise protocol. N95, snorkel masks with high-efficiency filters and snorkel masks with powered-air purifying respirators were tested. Respiratory filtration ratios were collected for each step and averaged to obtain an overall workplace protocol fit factor. Failure was defined as either an individual filtration ratio or an overall fit factor below 100. N95s and snorkel masks with high-efficiency filters failed one or more testing steps in 59% and 20% of participants, respectively, and 24% and 12% failed overall fit factors, respectively. The snorkel masks with powered-air purifying respirators had zero individual or overall failures.

453275,Systematic literature review on novel corona virus SARS-CoV-2: a threat to human era,2020,"BACKGROUND: The case count for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the predominant measure used to track epidemiological dynamics and inform policy decision-making. Case counts, however, are influenced by testing rates and strategies, which have varied over time and space. A method to interpret COVID-19 case counts consistently in the context of other surveillance data is needed, especially for data-limited settings in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). METHODS: Statistical analyses were used to detect changes in COVID-19 surveillance data. The pruned exact linear time change detection method was applied for COVID-19 case counts, number of tests, and test positivity rate over time. With this information, change points were categorized as likely driven by epidemiological dynamics or non-epidemiological influences, such as noise. FINDINGS: Higher rates of epidemiological change detection are more associated with open testing policies than with higher testing rates. This study quantified alignment of non-pharmaceutical interventions with epidemiological changes. LMICs have the testing capacity to measure prevalence with precision if they use randomized testing. Rwanda stands out as a country with an efficient COVID-19 surveillance system. Subnational data reveal heterogeneity in epidemiological dynamics and surveillance. INTERPRETATION: Relying solely on case counts to interpret pandemic dynamics has important limitations. Normalizing counts by testing rate mitigates some of these limitations, and an open testing policy is key to efficient surveillance. The study findings can be leveraged by public health officials to strengthen COVID-19 surveillance and support programmatic decision-making.","Van Gordon, Mollie M; McCarthy, Kevin A; Proctor, Joshua L; Hagedorn, Brittany L",Int J Infect Dis,,175

460661,Active surveillance documents rates of clinical care seeking due to respiratory illness,2020,"BACKGROUND: The increasing incidence of COVID-19 infection has challenged health care systems to increase capacity while conserving personal protective equipment (PPE) supplies and minimizing nosocomial spread. Telemedicine shows promise to address these challenges but lacks comprehensive evaluation in the inpatient environment. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to evaluate an intrahospital telemedicine program (virtual care), along with its impact on exposure risk and communication. METHODS: We conducted a natural experiment of virtual care on patients admitted for COVID-19. The primary exposure variable was documented use of virtual care. Patient characteristics, PPE use rates, and their association with virtual care use were assessed. In parallel, we conducted surveys with patients and clinicians to capture satisfaction with virtual care along the domains of communication, medical treatment, and exposure risk. RESULTS: Of 137 total patients in our primary analysis, 43 patients used virtual care. In total, there were 82 inpatient days of use and 401 inpatient days without use. Hospital utilization and illness severity were similar in patients who opted in versus opted out. Virtual care was associated with a significant reduction in PPE use and physical exam rate. Surveys of 41 patients and clinicians showed high rates of recommendation for further use, and subjective improvements in communication. However, providers and patients expressed limitations in usability, medical assessment, and empathetic communication. CONCLUSIONS: In this pilot natural experiment, only a subset of patients used inpatient virtual care. When used, virtual care was associated with reductions in PPE use, reductions in exposure risk, and patient and provider satisfaction.","Legler, Sean; Diehl, Matthew; Hilliard, Brian; Olson, Andrew; Markowitz, Rebecca; Tignanelli, Christopher; Melton, Genevieve B; Broccard, Alain; Kirsch, Jonathan; Usher, Michael",J Med Internet Res,,175

OBJECTIVES: We sought to determine the association between biologics or systemic corticosteroids use and PCR positivity for SARS-CoV-2 and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outcomes among asthmatic patients. METHODS: We used the computerized database of Clalit Health Services, the largest health care provider in Israel, to identify all asthmatic adult patients who underwent PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2, between March 1, 2020, and December 7, 2020. A cohort approach was used to assess the association between biologics use and steroids treatment and COVID-19 severity and 90-day mortality. RESULTS: Overall, 8,242 of 80,602 tested asthmatic patients had positive PCR testing result for SARS-CoV-2. Both biologics and systemic corticosteroids were not associated with increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Multivariate analyses revealed that biologics were not associated with a significantly increased risk of moderate to severe COVID-19, nor with the composite end point of moderate to severe COVID-19 or all-cause mortality within 90 days. Chronic systemic corticosteroid use was associated with significantly increased risk of all tested outcome. Recent (within the previous 120 days) systemic corticosteroid use, but not former use, was significantly associated with increased risk of both moderate to severe COVID-19 and the composite of moderate to severe COVID-19 or all-cause mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Biologics approved for asthma and systemic corticosteroids are not associated with increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In contrast, systemic corticosteroids are an independent risk factor for worst COVID-19 severity and all-cause mortality. Our findings underscore the risk of recent or current exposure to systemic corticosteroids in asthmatic patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.","Adir, Yochai; Humbert, Marc; Saliba, Walid",J. allergy clin. immunol,,175

Some theories claimed that COVID-19 virus activities were affected by climate variability. The aim of this study is to search and predict the correlation between daily incidences of COVID-19 with climate variability in Jakarta. A cross sectional study was made, sampling total daily cases of COVID-19 in Jakarta from March 3 to July 3, 2020. Climate variability consisted of the mean daily temperature (MDT), mean daily humidity (MDH), mean daily rainfall (MDR), length of solar radiation (LSR), and mean daily wind velocity (MDW). The incidence of COVID-19 was registered by data in the Department of Health (DoH) in Jakarta, while climate variability was obtained by data from the Geophysical and Meteorological Board (BMKG). This data was analyzed by Pearson correlation, Poisson regression and linear regression using SPSS version 23. The mean and standard deviations of the incidences of COVID-19 during the four months were 98.32 +/- 56, MDT 29.1 +/- 0.77, MDH 77.9 +/- 3.84, MDR 51.3 +/- 453.2, LSR 5.03 +/- 2.5, and MDW 1.7 +/- 0.51. Pearson correlation was found as MDT p=0.048, r=0.17;MDH p=0.015, r= -0.219, MDR p=0.397, r=0.087, LSR p=0.8, r=0.01, MDW p=0.00, r=-0.3, respectively.

While previous studies have shown that several SARS-CoV-2 proteins can antagonize the interferon (IFN) response, some of the mechanisms by which they do so are not well understood. In this study, we describe two novel mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 blocks the IFN pathway. Type I IFNs and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) were poorly induced during SARS-CoV-2 infection, and once infection was established, cells were highly resistant to ectopic induction of IFNs and ISGs. Levels of two key IFN signaling pathway components, Tyk2 and STAT2, were significantly lower in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. Expression of nonstructural protein 1 (NSP1) or nucleocapsid in the absence of other viral proteins was sufficient to block IFN induction, but only NSP1 was able to inhibit IFN signaling. Mapping studies suggest that NSP1 prevents IFN induction in part by blocking IRF3 phosphorylation. In addition, NSP1-induced depletion of Tyk2 and STAT2 dampened ISG induction. Together, our data provide new insights into how SARS-CoV-2 successfully evades the IFN system to establish infection. IMPORTANCE SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of COVID-19, a serious disease that can have a myriad of symptoms from loss of taste and smell to pneumonia and hypercoagulation. The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 can be attributed in part to asymptomatic transmission, where infected individuals shed large amounts of virus before the onset of disease. This is likely due to the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to effectively suppress the innate immune system, including the IFN response. Indeed, we show that the IFN response is efficiently blocked during SARS-CoV-2 infection, a process that is mediated in large part by nonstructural protein 1 and nucleocapsid.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: On June 18, 2020, we identified frequently used eligibility criteria from all the interventional COVID-19 trials in ClinicalTrials.gov (n = 288), including age, pregnancy, oxygen saturation, alanine/aspartate aminotransferase, platelets, and estimated glomerular filtration rate. We applied the frequently used criteria to the EHR data of COVID-19 patients in Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUIMC) (March 2020-June 2020) and evaluated their impact on patient accrual and the occurrence of a composite endpoint of mechanical ventilation, tracheostomy, and in-hospital death. RESULTS: There were 3251 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 from the CUIMC EHR included in the analysis. The median follow-up period was 10 days (interquartile range 4-28 days). The composite events occurred in 18.1% (n = 587) of the COVID-19 cohort during the follow-up. In a hypothetical trial with common eligibility criteria, 33.6% (690/2051) were eligible among patients with evaluable data and 22.2% (153/690) had the composite event. DISCUSSION: By adjusting the thresholds of common eligibility criteria based on the characteristics of COVID-19 patients, we could observe more composite events from fewer patients. CONCLUSIONS: This research demonstrated the potential of using the EHR data of COVID-19 patients to inform the selection of eligibility criteria and their thresholds, supporting data-driven optimization of participant selection towards improved statistical power of COVID-19 trials.","Kim, Jae Hyun; Ta, Casey N; Liu, Cong; Sung, Cynthia; Butler, Alex M; Stewart, Latoya A; Ena, Lyudmila; Rogers, James R; Lee, Junghwan; Ostropolets, Anna; Ryan, Patrick B; Liu, Hao; Lee, Shing M; Elkind, Mitchell S V; Weng, Chunhua",J. am. med. inform. assoc,,175

489470,Authors' correction for Euro Surveill. 2020;25(17),2020,"BACKGROUND: Rural and urban differences in health outcomes and behaviors have been well-documented, with significant rural health disparities frequently highlighted. Mobile health (mHealth) apps, such as meditation apps, are a novel method for improving health and behaviors. These apps may be a critical health promotion strategy during the COVID-19 pandemic and could potentially be used to address rural health disparities. However, limited research has assessed whether meditation app health outcomes are associated with rural and urban residence, and it is unclear whether disparities in health and behaviors between rural and urban populations would persist among meditation app users. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to explore associations between rural or urban status, psychological outcomes, and physical activity among users of a mobile meditation app. We further aimed to explore associations between rural or urban status and perceived effects of COVID-19 on stress, mental health, and physical activity, and to explore changes in these outcomes in rural versus urban app users over time. METHODS: This study was a secondary analysis of a national survey conducted among subscribers to the meditation app Calm. Eligible participants completed online baseline surveys from April to June 2020, and follow-up surveys from June to September 2020, assessing demographics, psychological outcomes, physical activity, and perceived effects of COVID-19 on stress, mental health, and physical activity. RESULTS: Participants (N=8392) were mostly female (7041/8392, 83.9%), non-Hispanic (7855/8392, 93.6%), and White (7704/8392, 91.8%); had high socioeconomic status (income &#8805;US $100,000: 4389/8392, 52.3%; bachelor's degree or higher: 7251/8392, 86.4%); and resided in a metropolitan area core (rural-urban commuting area code 1: 7192/8392, 85.7%). Rural or urban status was not associated with baseline stress, depression, anxiety, pre-COVID-19 and current physical activity, or perceived effects of COVID-19 on stress, mental health, and physical activity. Repeated-measures models showed overall decreases in depression, anxiety, and perceived effects of COVID-19 on physical activity from baseline to follow-up, and no significant changes in stress or perceived effects of COVID-19 on stress and mental health over time. Models also showed no significant main effects of rural or urban status, COVID-19 statewide prevalence at baseline, or change in COVID-19 statewide prevalence. CONCLUSIONS: We did not find associations between rural or urban status and psychological outcomes (ie, stress, depression, and anxiety), physical activity, or perceived effects of COVID-19 on stress, mental health, and physical activity. Rural or urban status does not appear to drive differences in outcomes among meditation app users, and the use of mHealth apps should continue to be explored as a health promotion strategy in both rural and urban populations. Furthermore, our results did not show negative cumulative effects of COVID-19 on psychological outcomes and physical activity among app users in our sample, the majority of whom were urban, White, female, and of high socioeconomic status. Further research is needed to investigate meditation app use as a health promotion strategy in rural and urban populations.","Bhuiyan, Nishat; Puzia, Megan; Stecher, Chad; Huberty, Jennifer",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,,175
490524,Authors' correction for Euro Surveill. 2020;25(9),2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has forced the health public authorities to impose a lockdown as an epidemiological containment strategy. This study aimed to provide information regarding the impact of the mandatory confinement on the physical activity, eating disorders risk, sleep quality and well-being on a Spanish sample. An online survey that included the Minnesota Leisure Time Physical Activity Questionnaire, the Eating Attitude Test-26, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index was administered two days after the state of alarm was stablished in Spain and five days after such measures began to be eased. Out of the 693 people who answered the first questionnaire, 161 completed the second one. These participants spent a total of 48 days locked at home, a period during which a significant worsening in all the variables assessed except for the risk of developing eating disorders, was observed: weight (kg), 67.3 ± 14.8 vs 67.7 ± 15.1, p = 0.012; physical activity (MET minutes per week), 8515.7 ± 10260.0 vs 5053.5 ± 5502.0, p < 0.001; sleep problems (total score), 6.2 ± 3.5 vs 7.2 ± 3.9, p < 0.001; self-perceived well-being (score), 4 (3-4) vs 3 (3-4), p < 0.001. The confinement had a significant differential effect on physically active participants, who experienced a significant decline (p < 0.05) on their physical activity levels, quality of sleep and well-being; whereas physically inactive participants did not experience significant changes. Findings from this longitudinal study indicate that a lockdown period due to COVID-19 had a negative impact on the physical activity levels, sleep quality and well-being in a group of physically active Spanish adults. Public health authorities should be aware that people who usually lead an active lifestyle, might be particularly susceptible to such disruptions.","Martínez-de-Quel, Óscar; Suárez-Iglesias, David; López-Flores, Marcos; Pérez, Carlos Ayán",Appetite,,175

492327,Tracking of Infused Mesenchymal Stem Cells in Injured Pulmonary Tissue in Atm-Deficient Mice,2020,"OBJECTIVE: The unprecedented occurrence of a global pandemic is accompanied by both physical and psychological burdens that may impair quality of life. Research relating to COVID-19 aims to determine the effects of the pandemic on vulnerable populations who are at high risk of developing negative health or psychosocial outcomes. Having an ongoing medical condition during a pandemic may lead to greater psychological distress. Increased psychological distress may be due to preventative public health measures (e.g. lockdown), having an ongoing medical condition, or a combination of these factors. METHODS: This study analyses data from an online cross-sectional national survey of adults in Ireland and investigates the relationship between comorbidity and psychological distress. Those with a medical condition (n = 128) were compared to a control group without a medical condition (n = 128) and matched according to age, gender, annual income, education, and work status during COVID-19. Participants and data were obtained during the first public lockdown in Ireland (27 March 2020-8 June 2020). RESULTS: Individuals with existing medical conditions reported significantly higher levels of anxiety (p < .01) and felt less gratitude (p &#8804; .001). Exploratory analysis indicated that anxiety levels were significantly associated with illness perceptions specific to COVID-19. Post hoc analysis revealed that psychological well-being was not significantly related to condition type (e.g. respiratory disorders). CONCLUSION: This research supports individualised supports for people with ongoing medical conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic, and has implications for the consideration of follow-up care specifically for mental health. Findings may also inform future public health policies and post-vaccine support strategies for vulnerable populations.","Stafford, Owen; Berry, Anna; Taylor, Laura K; Wearen, Sinead; Prendergast, Cian; Murphy, Eddie; Shevlin, Mark; McHugh, Louise; Carr, Alan; Burke, Tom",Ir J Psychol Med,,175

Nevertheless, measuring the sustainability and resilience of BSCs is a major challenge for many decision-makers in healthcare systems. To this end, this paper presents an advanced network data envelopment analysis (NDEA) method to evaluate the sustainability and resilience of BSCs. We deal with BSCs, including blood collection centers (BCCs), blood production centers (BPCs), and blood distribution centers (BDCs). A new directional distance function (DDF) is also developed for evaluating both the overall and stage efficiency scores. Our proposed model can deal with different types of data, including integers, undesirable outputs, negative, zero, and positive. The undesirable outputs are the outputs that adversely impact the performance of DMUs. Moreover, the developed method addresses the sustainability and resilience of BSCs. A case study is provided to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed model.","Kazemi Matin, Reza Azadi Majid Saen Reza Farzipoor",Decision Support Systems,,175
493703,Reciprocal interactions between mesenchymal stem cells and macrophages,2020,"BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has put a lot of physical and psychological pressure on healthcare professionals, including physicians at the frontline. Thus, evaluating the mental health status of physicians during the current pandemic is important to define future preventive guidelines from healthcare stakeholders. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we intended to study alterations in the mental health status of Portuguese physicians working at the COVID-19 frontline, and potential sociodemographic factors influencing this status. METHODS: A national survey was applied from 4 to 25 of May 2020 to infer differences in mental health status (depression, anxiety, stress, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms) between Portuguese physicians working at the frontline of COVID-19 (FRONT) and other physicians that were not working at the frontline (NFRONT). A representative sample of 420 participants stratified by age, sex, and the geographic region was analyzed (200 FRONT participants and 220 NFRONT individuals). Moreover, we explored the influence of several sociodemographic factors on mental health variables (age, sex, living conditions, and household composition). RESULTS: Our results showed that being female (ß = 1.1, t = 2.5, p = 0.013) and working at the frontline (ß = 1.4, t = 2.9, p = 0.004) are potential risk factors for stress. In contrast, having a house with green space was a potentially beneficial factor for stress (ß = -1.5, t = -2.5, p = 0.014) and anxiety (ß = -1.1, t = -2.4, p = 0.017). CONCLUSIONS: There is a necessity of applying protective mental health measures for physicians to avoid long-term effects of stress such as burnout.","Ferreira, Sónia; Sousa, Mafalda Machado; Moreira, Pedro Silva; Sousa, Nuno; Picó-Pérez, Maria; Morgado, Pedro",,,175

495527,Dissecting lipid metabolism alterations in SARS-CoV-2,2021,"Metabolomics, which consists of the comprehensive analysis of metabolites within a biological system, has been playing a growing role in the implementation of personalized medicine in modern healthcare. A wide range of analytical approaches are used in metabolomics, notably mass spectrometry (MS) combined to liquid chromatography (LC), gas chromatography (GC), or capillary electrophoresis (CE). However, none of these methods enable a comprehensive analysis of the metabolome, due to its extreme complexity and the large differences in physico-chemical properties between metabolite classes. In this context, supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC) represents a promising alternative approach to improve the metabolome coverage, while further increasing the analysis throughput. SFC, which uses supercritical CO2 as mobile phase, leads to numerous advantages such as improved kinetic performance and lower environmental impact. This chromatographic technique has gained a significant interest since the introduction of advanced instrumentation, together with the introduction of dedicated interfaces for hyphenating SFC to MS. Moreover, new developments in SFC column chemistry (including sub-2 µm particles), as well as the use of large amounts of organic modifiers and additives in the CO2-based mobile phase, significantly extended the application range of SFC, enabling the simultaneous analysis of a large diversity of metabolites. Over the last years, several applications have been reported in metabolomics using SFC-MS - from lipophilic compounds, such as steroids and other lipids, to highly polar compounds, such as carbohydrates, amino acids, or nucleosides. With all these advantages, SFC-MS is promised to a bright future in the field of metabolomics.","van de Velde, Bas; Guillarme, Davy; Kohler, Isabelle",J Chromatogr B Analyt Technol Biomed Life Sci,,175

497378,Measures to Avoid Exogenous RNA Contamination of NCP Nucleic Acid Detection,2020,"COVID-19 has impacted nations differently based on their policy implementations. The effective policy requires taking into account public information and adaptability to new knowledge. Epidemiological models built to understand COVID-19 seldom provide the policymaker with the capability for adaptive pandemic control (APC). Among the core challenges to be overcome include (a) inability to handle a high degree of non-homogeneity in different contributing features across the pandemic timeline, (b) lack of an approach that enables adaptive incorporation of public health expert knowledge, and (c) transparent models that enable understanding of the decision-making process in suggesting policy. In this work, we take the early steps to address these challenges using Knowledge Infused Policy Gradient (KIPG) methods. Prior work on knowledge infusion does not handle soft and hard imposition of varying forms of knowledge in disease information and guidelines to necessarily comply with. Furthermore, the models do not attend to non-homogeneity in feature counts, manifesting as partial observability in informing the policy. Additionally, interpretable structures are extracted post-learning instead of learning an interpretable model required for APC. To this end, we introduce a mathematical framework for KIPG methods that can (a) induce relevant feature counts over multi-relational features of the world, (b) handle latent non-homogeneous counts as hidden variables that are linear combinations of kernelized aggregates over the features, and (b) infuse knowledge as functional constraints in a principled manner. The study establishes a theory for imposing hard and soft constraints and simulates it through experiments. In comparison with knowledge-intensive baselines, we show quick sample efficient adaptation to new knowledge and interpretability in the learned policy, especially in a pandemic context. © 2021 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

This study aimed to investigate the associations of nonadherence to treatment with patient-reported outcomes of psoriasis during the COVID-2019 epidemic. Methods: A cross-sectional study among Chinese patients with psoriasis was conducted through a web-based questionnaire survey during 25 Feb 2020 and 6 Mar 2020. Demographic and clinical data, nonadherence to treatment, and patient-reported outcomes were collected. The outcomes included deterioration of the disease condition, perceived stress, and symptoms of anxiety and depression. Logistic regression was used to investigate the associations. Results: A total of 926 questionnaires were collected. A total of 634 (68.5%) reported nonadherence to treatment, and worse adherence was found among patients receiving systemic treatment (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 2.67; 95% CI: 1.40–5.10) and topical treatment (AOR: 4.51; 95% CI: 2.66–7.65) compared to biological treatment. Nonadherence to treatment (less than two weeks and more than two weeks) was significantly associated with deterioration of psoriasis (aOR: 2.83 to 5.25), perceived stress (AOR: 1.86 to 1.57), and symptoms of anxiety (AOR: 1.42 to 1.57) and depression (AORs: 1.78). Subgroup analysis by treatment showed consistent results in general. Conclusion: Nonadherence to treatment was associated with the aggravation of psoriasis conditions, perceived stress, and symptoms of anxiety and depression.","Wang, Qiaolin; Luo, Yan; Lv, Chengzhi; Zheng, Xuanwei; Zhu, Wu; Chen, Xiang; Shen, Minxue; Kuang, Yehong",Patient Preference Adherence,,175
498920,Cardiotoxicity induced by the combination therapy of chloroquine and azithromycin in human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes,2020,"To evaluate the efficacy and safety of a new treatment for COVID-19 vs. standard care, certain key endpoints are related to the duration of a specific event, such as hospitalization, ICU stay, or receipt of supplemental oxygen. However, since patients may die in the hospital during study follow-up, using, for example, the duration of hospitalization to assess treatment efficacy can be misleading. If the treatment tends to prolong patients' survival compared with standard care, patients in the new treatment group may spend more time in hospital. This can lead to a ""survival bias"" issue, where a treatment that is effective for preventing death appears to prolong an undesirable outcome. On the other hand, by using hospital-free survival time as the endpoint, we can circumvent the survival bias issue. In this article, we use reconstructed data from a recent, large clinical trial for COVID-19 to illustrate the advantages of this approach. For the analysis of ICU stay or oxygen usage, where the initiating event is potentially an outcome of treatment, standard survival analysis techniques may not be appropriate. We also discuss issues with analyzing the durations of such events.","McCaw, Zachary R; Tian, Lu; Sheth, Kevin N; Hsu, Wan-Ting; Kimberly, W Taylor; Wei, Lee-Jen",Contemp Clin Trials,,175

However, the response effect of some uncommon EGFR mutations to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) remains unclear. Here, we present a patient with multiple EGFR mutations that highlights tumor heterogeneity leading to a mixed molecular response to targeted drugs and emphasizes the complexity of EGFR-driven lung cancer. He received chemotherapy and molecular-targeted treatment including icotinib, afatinib, osimertinib and afatinib + osimertinib. In conclusion, patients with lung adenocarcinoma harboring the EGFR S768I and G724S mutations appear less sensitive to icotinib than patients with sensitive EGFR.

Non-diabetic HnrnpfRT KO mice develop hypertension, renal interstitial fibrosis and glycosuria with no renoprotective effect from downregulated Sglt2 expression. Here, we investigated the effect of renal tubular Hnrnpf deletion on hyperfiltration and kidney injury in Akita mice, a model of type 1 diabetes. METHODS: Akita HnrnpfRT KO mice were generated through crossbreeding tubule-specific (Pax8)-Cre mice with Akita floxed-Hnrnpf mice on a C57BL/6 background. Male non-diabetic control (Ctrl), Akita, and Akita HnrnpfRT KO mice were studied up to the age of 24 weeks (n = 8/group). RESULTS: Akita mice exhibited elevated systolic blood pressure as compared with Ctrl mice, which was significantly higher in Akita HnrnpfRT KO mice than Akita mice. Compared with Akita mice, Akita HnrnpfRT KO mice had lower blood glucose levels with increased urinary glucose excretion. Akita mice developed kidney hypertrophy, glomerular hyperfiltration (increased glomerular filtration rate), glomerulomegaly, mesangial expansion, podocyte foot process effacement, thickened glomerular basement membranes, renal interstitial fibrosis and increased albuminuria. These abnormalities were attenuated in Akita HnrnpfRT KO mice. Treatment of Akita HnrnpfRT KO mice with a selective A1 adenosine receptor inhibitor resulted in an increase in glomerular filtration rate. Renal Agt expression was elevated in Akita mice and further increased in Akita HnrnpfRT KO mice. In contrast, Sglt2 expression was increased in Akita and decreased in Akita HnrnpfRT KO mice. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The renoprotective effect of Sglt2 downregulation overcomes the renal injurious effect of Agt when these opposing factors coexist under diabetic conditions, at least partly via the activation of tubuloglomerular feedback.","Miyata, Kana N; Lo, Chao-Sheng; Zhao, Shuiling; Zhao, Xin-Ping; Chenier, Isabelle; Yamashita, Michifumi; Filep, Janos G; Ingelfinger, Julie R; Zhang, Shao-Ling; Chan, John S D",Diabetologia,,175

510517,Insight into vaccine development for Alpha-coronaviruses based on structural and immunological analyses of spike proteins,2021,"Nowadays, COVID-19 also known as novel coronavirus has become a global pandemic by causing severe respiratory tract infections in humans without any definite treatment or vaccine. Therefore, disease control measures include slowing down or averting the transfer of this viral infection from person to person. Continuous efforts are carried out to avoid the transmission of this disease to frontline healthcare personnel using single-use personal protective equipment (PPE). However, a critical shortage in this equipment around the world is becoming an alarming concern. Therefore, it is vital to present a possible alternative to overcome the acute shortage of protective gear such as face masks against this infectious disease which can have universal accessibility and is easily available. Additive manufacturing (AM), also known as 3D printing, is a possible solution to overcome the shortage of protective gear and can play a vital role in supporting their conventional production supplies during this global pandemic situation. In this context, this paper provides a brief background study of COVID-19, its conventional preventive measure, and a detailed overview regarding the latest AM efforts including designers' providers and makers in the 3D printing community. Moreover, numerous inquiries and questions such as technical factors, testing recommendations and characterization methods and biological concerns such as biocompatibility and sterilization for the AM manufactured medical devices are addressed in this paper. In the end, two examples of AM medical devices, i.e., face mask and Ambu bag ventilator, are presented and studied through numerical simulations.","Tarfaoui, M; Nachtane, M; Goda, I; Qureshi, Y; Benyahia, H",Int J Adv Manuf Technol,,175

Traditional didactics include lectures, grand rounds, simulations, case discussions, and other forms of in-person synchronous learning. The COVID-19 pandemic has made in-person activities less feasible, as many programs have been forced to transition to remote didactics. Educators must still achieve the goals and objectives of their didactic curriculum despite the new limitations on instructional strategies. There are several strategies that may be useful for organizing and creating a remote residency didactic curriculum. Educators must master new technology, be flexible and creative, and set rules of engagement for instructors and learners. Establishing best practices for remote didactics will result in successful, remote, synchronous didactics; reduce the impact of transitioning to a remote learning environment; and keep educators and learners safe as shelter-at-home orders remain in place.","Rivera, Ronald; Smart, Jonathan; Sakaria, Sangeeta; Wray, Alisa; Wiechmann, Warren; Boysen-Osborn, Megan; Toohey, Shannon",JMIR Med Educ,,175

Strict preventive measures have been implemented during April and May and then a normalization phase started in our country in June. Our aim is to evaluate the effect of preventive measures during the pandemic process on allergic airway disease symptoms. Methods: A prospective questionnaire-based study was planned and a questionnaire form was sent to the cell-phones of the subjects with pollen allergy followed in our clinic. Number of airborne grass pollens was determined by Burkard volumetric 7-day spore trap. Results: A total of 222 pollen allergic patients were included in the study. At the beginning of the pandemic, majority of the subjects were spending time mostly indoors. The rate of home-office workers gradually decreased and the rate of office workers and the number of days at work increased from April to June, significantly. Nasal and ocular symptoms of the patients, also increased in June compared to April and May and, approximately one-third of the patients had less symptoms when compared to the same period of the previous year. The rates of using a face mask and taking a shower on return home were high among the subjects during all season.Conclusion: Our study showed that spending less time outside during the pollen season and wearing a mask outdoors reduces exposure to pollens and causes a reduction in symptoms. Thus, strict application of measures that cannot be applied in daily practice can make a significant contribution to the management of seasonal allergic rhinitis.","Sözener, Z. Ç Öztürk B.

METHODS: Patients (n = 58) were grouped according to their main neurological presentation: headache (n = 14); encephalopathy (n = 24); inflammatory neurological diseases, including meningoencephalitis (n = 4), acute myelitis (n = 3), meningitis (n = 2), acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) (n = 2), encephalitis (n = 2), and neuromyelitis optica (n = 1); and Guillain-Barré syndrome (n = 6). Data regarding age, sex, cerebrovascular disease, and intracranial pressure were evaluated in combination with CSF profiles defined by cell counts, total protein and glucose levels, concentration of total Tau and neurofilament light chain (NfL) proteins, oligoclonal band patterns, and detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. RESULTS: CSF of patients with inflammatory neurological diseases was characterized by pleocytosis and elevated total protein and NfL levels. Patients with encephalopathy were mostly older men (mean age of 61.0 ± 17.6 years) with evidence of cerebrovascular disease. SARS-CoV-2 RNA in CSF was detected in 2 of 58 cases: a patient with refractory headache, and another patient who developed ADEM four days after onset of COVID-19 symptoms. Three patients presented intrathecal IgG synthesis, and four had identical oligoclonal bands in CSF and serum, indicating systemic inflammation. CONCLUSION: Patients with neurological manifestations associated with COVID-19 had diverse CSF profiles, even within the same clinical condition. Our findings indicate a possible contribution of viral replication on triggering CNS infiltration by immune cells and the subsequent inflammation promoting neuronal injury.","Espíndola, Otávio Melo; Brandão, Carlos Otávio; Gomes, Yago Côrtes Pinheiro; Siqueira, Marilda; Soares, Cristiane Nascimento; Lima, Marco Antônio Sales Dantas; Leite, Ana Claudia Celestino Bezerra; Torezani, Guilherme; Araujo, Abelardo Queiroz Campos; Silva, Marcus Tulius Teixeira",Int J Infect Dis,,175

Yet, understanding how their environment shapes diversity within species and across taxa is limited by a paucity of observations of heritability and life history. Here, we present observations of asexual reproduction, morphologic plasticity, and ontogeny in the planktic foraminifer Neogloboquadrina pachyderma in laboratory culture. Our results demonstrate that planktic foraminifera reproduce both sexually and asexually and demonstrate extensive phenotypic plasticity in response to nonheritable factors. These two processes fundamentally explain the rapid spatial and temporal response of even imperceptibly low populations of planktic foraminifera to optimal conditions and the diversity and ubiquity of these species across the range of environmental conditions that occur in the ocean.","Davis, Catherine V; Livsey, Caitlin M; Palmer, Hannah M; Hull, Pincelli M; Thomas, Ellen; Hill, Tessa M; Benitez-Nelson, Claudia R",Sci.

Besides the chemical resistance and durability, as well as the ability to withstand steam sterilization, this polypropylene (PP) copolymer is characterized by its high purity, as achieved by highly efficient and selective catalytic polymerization. As the PP copolymer is suited to be printed with all common printers in fused filament fabrication (FFF), it offers an eco-friendly cost-benefit ratio, even for large-scale production. In addition, a digital workflow was established focusing on common desktop FFF printers in the medical sector. It comprises the simulation-based optimization of personalized print objects, considering the inherent material properties such as warping tendency, through to validation of the process chain by 3D scanning, sterilization, and biocompatibility analysis of the printed part. This combination of digital data processing and 3D printing with a sustainable and medically certified material showed great promise in establishing decentralized additive manufacturing in everyday hospital life to meet peaks in demand, supply bottlenecks, and enhanced personalized patient treatment.","Burkhardt, Felix; Schirmeister, Carl G; Wesemann, Christian; Nutini, Massimo; Pieralli, Stefano; Licht, Erik H; Metzger, Marc; Wenz, Frederik; Mülhaupt, Rolf; Spies, Benedikt C",Molecules (Basel),,175

The Neyman–Pearson (NP) criteria is employed for this device-free detection. Different from the frequency-based approaches, the proposed detection method utilizes time domain concepts. The characteristic function (CF) is utilized to measure the moments of the presence and absence of the device. Furthermore, this method is easily extendable to existing device-free and device-based techniques. This method can also be applied to different pulse-based UWB systems which use different modulation schemes compared to IR-UWB. In addition, the proposed method does not require training to measure or calibrate the system operating parameters. From the simulation results, it is observed that an optimal threshold can be chosen to improve the ROC for UWB system. It is shown that the probability of false alarm, [Formula: see text] , has an inverse relationship with the detection threshold and frame length. Particularly, to maintain [Formula: see text] for a frame length of 300 ns, it is required that the threshold should be greater than [Formula: see text].

In SARS coronaviruses, the non-structural protein 16 (nsp16) methylates the 5’-end of virally encoded mRNAs to mimic cellular mRNAs, thus protecting the virus from host innate immune restriction. We report here the high-resolution structure of a ternary complex of full-length nsp16 and nsp10 of SARS-CoV-2 in the presence of cognate RNA substrate and a methyl donor, S-adenosyl methionine. The nsp16/nsp10 heterodimer was captured in the act of 2’-O methylation of the ribose sugar of the first nucleotide of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA. We reveal large conformational changes associated with substrate binding as the enzyme transitions from a binary to a ternary state. This structure provides new mechanistic insights into the 2’-O methylation of the viral mRNA cap. We also discovered a distantly located ligand-binding site unique to SARS-CoV-2 that may serve as an alternative target site for antiviral development.","Viswanathan, Thiruselvam; Arya, Shailee; Chan, Siu-Hong; Qi, Shan; Dai, Nan; Hromas, Robert A.; Park, Jun-Gyu; Oladunni, Fatai; Martinez-Sobrido, Luis; Gupta, Yogesh K.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.26.061705; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32511383/,175

Few studies have investigated the role of socioeconomic factors in the spread of COVID-19. Methods: The number of COVID-19 cases in the 39 well-developed cities of China was aggregated by searching the publicly available sources. Socioeconomic indicators (e.g., population, population density, gross domestic product, rural-to-urban migrants, urbanization rate, per-person disposable income, and level of health care) in these cities were also aggregated from the Bureau of Statistics. The data referring to travelers from Wuhan were collected from the Baidu Migration database. A multiple stepwise linear regression model was performed to identify the independent risk factors of the number of cases. Results: As of Mar 19, 2020, a total of 5,939 cases were reported in the 39 well-developed cities with almost half of total cases in China outside of Hubei. The number of cases ranged 20–576, and the median number of cases was 93 (IQR 54–180) in these cities. Nine socioeconomic variables including the number of travelers from Wuhan, population, native population, gross domestic product, Per-person GDP, the number of hospitals, the number of rural-to-urban migrants, traffic capacity, and person-disposable income were recognized as potential contributors of the number of cases. Results of multiple linear regression showed a statistically significant association between the number of cases and the number of travelers from Wuhan (t = 6.746, P = 0.000) and the number of rural-to-urban migrants (t = 3.776, P = 0.001) in these cities. However, other seven potential contributors were not associated with the number of cases. Moreover, a well-fitted multiple regression model was built in this study, and a regression equation was as follows: Y = 0.007X(t) + 0.200X(m) (adjusted R(2) = 0.833). Conclusions: Travelers from Wuhan and rural-to-urban migrants were independently associated with the COVID-19 outbreak in the 39 well-developed cities of China. These findings suggested that travelers from an epicenter and rural-to-urban migrants should be paid more attention in the early stage of the COVID-19 outbreak in the well-developed cities.","Lin, Yiting; Zhong, Ping; Chen, Ting",Front Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2020.546637; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33194948/,175

Methods: A population-based household survey was performed in the State of Maranhao, Brazil, from 27 July 2020 to 8 August 2020 to estimate the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 using a serum testing electrochemiluminescence immunoassay. A three-stage cluster sampling stratified by four state regions was used. The estimates took clustering, stratification, and non-response into account. Qualitative detection of IgM and IgG antibodies was performed in a fully-automated Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 electrochemiluminescence immunoassay on the Cobas e601 analyser (Roche Diagnostics). Findings: A total of 3156 individuals were interviewed. Seroprevalence of total antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 was 40.4% (95%CI 35.6-45.3). Population adherence to non-pharmaceutical interventions was higher at the beginning of the pandemic than in the last month. SARS-CoV-2 infection rates were significantly lower among mask wearers and among those who maintained social and physical distancing in the last month compared to their counterparts. Among the infected, 62.2% had more than three symptoms, 11.1% had one or two symptoms, and 26.0% were asymptomatic. The infection fatality rate was 0.17%, higher for males and advanced age groups. The ratio of estimated infections to reported cases was 22.2. Interpretation: To the best of our knowledge, the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 estimated in this population-based survey was the highest and the closest to the herd immunity threshold reported to date. Our results suggest that the herd immunity threshold is not as low as 20%, but at least higher than or equal to around 40%. The infection fatality rate was one of the lowest reported so far, and the proportion of asymptomatic cases was low.","Silva, AntÃ´nio Augusto Moura da; Neto, LÃ­dio GonÃ§alves Lima; Azevedo, ConceiÃ§Ã£o de Maria Pedrozo e Silva de; Costa, LÃ©a MÃ¡rcia Melo da; BraganÃ§a, Maylla Luana Barbosa Martins; Filho, Allan Kardec Duailibe Barros; Wittlin, Bernardo Bastos; Souza, Bruno Feres de; Oliveira, Bruno Luciano Carneiro Alves de; Carvalho, Carolina Abreu de; Thomaz, Ãrika BÃ¡rbara Abreu Fonseca; Neto, Eudes Alves SimÃµes; JÃºnior, Jamesson Ferreira Leite; Cosme, LÃ©cia Maria Sousa Santos; Campos, Marcos Adriano Garcia; Queiroz, Rejane Christine de Sousa; Costa, SÃ©rgio Souza; Carvalho, VitÃ³ria Abreu de; SimÃ³es, Vanda Maria Ferreira; Alves, Maria Teresa Seabra Soares de Britto e; Santos, Alcione Miranda dos",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.28.20180463; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.28.20180463v1?rss=1,175

Of the 1379 MERS cases recorded during the study period, 321 (23.3%) cases were linked to hospital infection, out of which 203 (14.7%) cases occurred among healthcare workers. There were 1113 isolated cases while the number of recorded contacts per MERS patient is between 1 (n=210) and 17 (n=1), with a mean of 0.27 (SD = 0.76). Five super-important nodes were identified based on their high number of connected contacts worthy of prioritization (at least degree of 5). The number of secondary cases in each SSE varies (range, 5–17). The eigenvector centrality was significantly (p < 0.05) associated with place of exposure, with hospitals having on average significantly higher eigenvector centrality than other places of exposure. Results suggested that being a healthcare worker has a higher eigenvector centrality score on average than being nonhealthcare workers.

596416,Stress Decreases Host Viral Resistance and Increases Covid Susceptibility in Embryonic Stem Cells,2021-06-21,"Spin-orbit coupled honeycomb magnets with the Kitaev interaction have received a lot of attention due to their potential of hosting exotic quantum states including quantum spin liquids. Thus far, the most studied Kitaev systems are 4d/5d-based honeycomb magnets. Recent theoretical studies predicted that 3d-based honeycomb magnets, including Na2Co2TeO6 (NCTO), could also be a potential Kitaev system. Here, we have used a combination of heat capacity, magnetization, electron spin resonance measurements alongside inelastic neutron scattering (INS) to study NCTO's quantum magnetism, and we have found a field-induced spin disordered state in an applied magnetic field range of 7.5 T<B (vertical to b-axis)<10.5 T. The INS spectra were also simulated to tentatively extract the exchange interactions. As a 3d-magnet with a field-induced disordered state on an effective spin-1/2 honeycomb lattice, NCTO expands the Kitaev model to 3d compounds, promoting further interests on the spin-orbital effect in quantum magnets.","Lin, Gaoting; Jeong, Jaehong; Kim, Chaebin; Wang, Yao; Huang, Qing; Masuda, Takatsugu; Asai, Shinichiro; Itoh, Shinichi; Gunther, Gerrit; Russina, Margarita; Lu, Zhilun; Sheng, Jieming; Wang, Le; Wang, Jiucai; Wang, Guohua; Ren, Qingyong; Xi, Chuanying; Tong, Wei; Ling, Langsheng; Liu, Zhengxin; Wu, Liusuo; Mei, Jiawei; Qu, Zhe; Zhou, Haidong; Wang, Xiaoqun; Park, Je-Geun; Wan, Yuan; Ma, Jie",Nature communications,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.00940v3.pdf; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34548484/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-25567-7,175
596478,Detection of feline norovirus using commercial real-time RT-PCR kit for the diagnosis of human norovirus infection,2021-03-11,"Exergame trainings might have therapeutic value in ataxic patients. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of exergame training with an exercise program on postural control by comparing it with traditional balance and coordination exercise program. Nineteen patients were randomly allocated to two groups. In the first group, exergame training and an exercise program (EEP) were applied together for the first 8 weeks; after 10 weeks washout, a conventional exercise program (CEP) was applied for the second 8 weeks. In the second group, the CEP was applied first followed by the EEP. Outcome measures were Limits of Stability test (LoS), International Classification Ataxia Ratio Scale (ICARS), Berg Balance Scale (BBS), and Timed-Up and Go test with a cognitive task (TUG-C), Reactive postural control and sensory orientation subscales of the Mini-BESTest. Seventeen patients (mean age ± SD, 32.53 ± 11.07 years) completed the study. ICARS, BBS scores improved only after EEP (p < 0.05). While there was no change in the RT and MVL parameters of the LoS test after EEP, the MXE, EPE, and DCL parameters improved significantly (p < 0.05). The MXE and MVL parameters of LoS improved after CEP (p < 0.05). There were no significant improvements in the Mini-BESTest’s reactive postural control and sensory orientation subscale scores after both EEP and CEP (p > 0.05). The results of the present study demonstrated that exergame training can be used as a complementary training option in physiotherapy to improve postural control in patients with ataxia.

We illustrate that the support with a patterned structure of nanosized gold can be exploited for (cryo) electron tomography application as a specimen support with predefined alignment markers. This nanogold patterned support has several advantages. The Si(3)N(4) window provides a 50 nm thin, strong and flat support with a ∼0.7 mm(2) large electron-beam transparent window. The nanogold pattern has a user-defined size and density, is highly regular and stable. This facilitates accurate tracking during tilt series acquisition, provides sufficient contrast for accurate alignment during the image reconstruction step and avoids an uneven lateral distribution and movement of individual fiducials. We showed that the support is suitable for electron tomography on plastic sections.","Koning, Roman I.; Kutchoukov, Vladimir G.; Hagen, Cornelis W.; Koster, Abraham J.",Ultramicroscopy,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0304399113001587; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304399113001587; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23954496/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ultramic.2013.06.015,175

We recruited 183 adult patients with CAD diagnosed with COVID‐19, including 52 taking low‐dose aspirin (mean [SD] age, 69.7 [1.1] years; 59.6% men) and 131 without using aspirin (mean [SD] age, 71.8 [0.9] years; 51.9% men), who were admitted in the Tongji hospital in Wuhan, China from January 10, 2020 to March 30, 2020. There was no difference on in‐hospital mortality between aspirin group and non‐aspirin group (21.2% vs. 22.1%, P = .885). Similarly, for critically severe COVID‐19 patients, the mortality in aspirin group was close to that in non‐aspirin group (44% vs. 45.9%, P = .872). Moreover, the percentage of patients with CAD taking low‐dose aspirin did not differ between those survivors and non‐survivors (28.7% vs. 27.5%, P = .885). Meanwhile, the usage of aspirin was not correlated with all‐cause mortality in multivariate analysis (OR = 0.944, 95% CI: 0.411‐2.172, P = .893). Collectively, our study suggested that the pre‐hospitalization use of low‐dose aspirin was not associated with the clinical outcome of patients with CAD hospitalized with COVID‐19 infections.","Yuan, Shuai; Chen, Peng; Li, Huaping; Chen, Chen; Wang, Feng; Wang, Dao Wen",J Cell Mol Med,https://doi.org/10.1111/jcmm.16198; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33336936/,175

The high contagiousness and mortality of COVID-19 and the complete lack of population immunity posed an extraordinary threat for global health. The aim of our research was to collect and review previous experiences on mass vaccination centers. On 4 April 2021, we developed a rapid review searching four electronic databases: PubMed/Medline, Scopus, EMBASE, Google Scholar and medRxiv. From a total of 2312 papers, 15 of them were included in the current review. Among them, only one article described a COVID-19 vaccination center; all of the others referred to other vaccinations, in particular influenza. The majority were conducted in the United States, and were simulations or single-day experiences to practice a mass vaccination after bioterrorist attacks. Indeed, all of them were published after September 11 attacks. Regarding staff, timing and performance, the data were highly heterogenous. Several studies used as a model the Center for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines. Results highlighted the differences around the definition, layout and management of a mass vaccination center, but some aspects can be considered as a core aspect. In light of this, we suggested a potential definition. The current review answers to the urgency of organizing a mass vaccination center during the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting the most important organizational aspects that should be considered in the planning.","Gianfredi, Vincenza; Pennisi, Flavia; Lume, Alessandra; Ricciardi, Giovanni Emanuele; Minerva, Massimo; Riccò, Matteo; Odone, Anna; Signorelli, Carlo",Vaccines (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9060574; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34205891/,175

This paper focuses on how to enhance target identification in a Boltzmann ensemble of structures via chemical probing data. We employ an information-theoretic approach to solve the problem, via considering a variant of the Rényi-Ulam game. Our framework is centered around the ensemble tree, a hierarchical bi-partition of the input ensemble, that is constructed by recursively querying about whether or not a base pair of maximum information entropy is contained in the target. These queries are answered via relating local with global probing data, employing the modularity in RNA secondary structures. We present that leaves of the tree are comprised of sub-samples exhibiting a distinguished structure with high probability. In particular, for a Boltzmann ensemble incorporating probing data, which is well established in the literature, the probability of our framework correctly identifying the target in the leaf is greater than [Formula: see text] .","Li, Thomas J.

Nevertheless, hesitancy towards the vaccines exist globally. OBJECTIVES: We conducted this study to understand the attitudes towards COVID 19 vaccines and hesitancy to accept it among urban and rural communities in Tamil Nadu, India. METHODS: We conducted a community based cross sectional study in urban and rural communities among 564 persons who had not been vaccinated yet, selected through multistage random sampling. The vaccine attitude scale (VAX) was used to measure attitudes towards the vaccines and their acceptance of the vaccine was captured by responses to a direct question. RESULTS: More than 50% of the respondents had positive attitudes towards the COVID 19 vaccines. Based on their attitudes, they were segmented into four clusters, first with preference for natural immunity compared to vaccines and low concern regarding adverse effects. Second with high level of trust in vaccines and low mistrust. The third cluster members had high level of concern regarding the adverse effects and low levels of mistrust in vaccines and the fourth had high trust in vaccines and low preference for natural immunity. Older individuals with higher education and occupation were more likely to belong to cluster four with high trust in the vaccines. Younger individuals, women, rural residents, belonging to low income labourer class were highly mistrusting of the vaccines. The prevalence of vaccine hesitancy was 40.7% (95% CI – 36.67 - 44.73%), while 19.5% (95% CI = 16.23 - 22.77%) of the respondents were vaccine deniers. While vaccine acceptance was greatest in cluster 1, it was least in cluster 3. CONCLUSIONS: Vaccine hesitancy was high in urban and rural Tamil Nadu. The population could be effectively segmented into groups based on their attitudes and this understanding can be used to develop targeted behaviour change communication campaigns.","Danabal, Kenneth Grace Mascarenhas; Magesh, Shiva Shankar; Saravanan, Siddharth; Gopichandran, Vijayaprasad",BMC Health Serv Res,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-021-07037-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34548088/,175

AIM: To describe the integration of palliative care principles in anesthesiology clinical practice, within and outside the ICU and to analyze the additional challenges that COVID-19 pandemic is posing in this context. METHODS: For the purpose of this review, PubMed database was searched for studies concerning palliative care and end of life care, in contexts involving anesthesiologists and intensivists, published in the last 5 years. RESULTS: Anesthesiologists and intensivists integrate palliative care within their daily practice providing symptoms management as well as family counseling. High-quality communicational skills are fundamental for anesthesiologists and intensivists especially when interfacing with surrogate decision makers in the ICU or with patients in the preoperative setting while discussing goals of care. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has challenged many aspects of palliative care delivery: reduced family presence within the ICU, communication with families through phone calls or video calls, patient–physician relationship mediated by bulky personal protective equipment and healthcare workers physical and psychological distress due to the increased workload and limitations in resources are some of the most evident. CONCLUSION: Anesthesiologists and intensivists are increasingly facing challenging clinical situations where principles and practice of palliative care have to be applied. In this sense, increasing knowledge on palliative care and providing specific training would allow to deliver high-quality symptom management, family counseling and end of life guidance in critical care settings.

SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA coronavirus. Effective countermeasures against SARS-CoV-2 infection require the design and development of specific and effective vaccine candidates. OBJECTIVE: To address the urgent need for a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, in the present study, we designed and validated one cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) and one helper T lymphocyte (HTL) multi-epitope vaccine (MEV) against SARS-CoV-2 using various in silico methods. METHODS: Both designed MEVs are composed of CTL and HTL epitopes screened from 11 Open Reading Frame (ORF), structural and nonstructural proteins of the SARS-CoV-2 proteome. Both MEVs also carry potential B-cell linear and discontinuous epitopes as well as interferon gamma–inducing epitopes. To enhance the immune response of our vaccine design, truncated (residues 10-153) Onchocerca volvulus activation-associated secreted protein-1 was used as an adjuvant at the N termini of both MEVs. The tertiary models for both the designed MEVs were generated, refined, and further analyzed for stable molecular interaction with toll-like receptor 3. Codon-biased complementary DNA (cDNA) was generated for both MEVs and analyzed in silico for high level expression in a mammalian (human) host cell line. RESULTS: In the present study, we screened and shortlisted 38 CTL, 33 HTL, and 12 B cell epitopes from the 11 ORF protein sequences of the SARS-CoV-2 proteome. Moreover, the molecular interactions of the screened epitopes with their respective human leukocyte antigen allele binders and the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) complex were positively validated. The shortlisted screened epitopes were utilized to design two novel MEVs against SARS-CoV-2. Further molecular models of both MEVs were prepared, and their stable molecular interactions with toll-like receptor 3 were positively validated. The codon-optimized cDNAs of both MEVs were also positively analyzed for high levels of overexpression in a human cell line. CONCLUSIONS: The present study is highly significant in terms of the molecular design of prospective CTL and HTL vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 infection with potential to elicit cellular and humoral immune responses. The epitopes of the designed MEVs are predicted to cover the large human population worldwide (96.10%). Hence, both designed MEVs could be tried in vivo as potential vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV-2.","Srivastava, Sukrit; Verma, Sonia; Kamthania, Mohit; Kaur, Rupinder; Badyal, Ruchi Kiran; Saxena, Ajay Kumar; Shin, Ho-Joon; Kolbe, Michael; Pandey, Kailash C",JMIR Bioinform Biotech,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32776022/; https://doi.org/10.2196/19371,175

Therefore, the aim of this study is to show protecting the children from radiation as much as possible while guiding the diagnosis. METHODS: Between March and June 2020, 148 pediatric patients examined who underwent CT due to suspicion of COVID-19. Fifty patients of 148 with normal thorax CT and negative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were excluded from the study. Of the remaining 98 patients were evaluated retrospectively by two pediatric radiologists with 15 years of experience. RESULTS: The demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were evaluated for 52 RT-PCR-positive patients. CT finding of 23 RT-PCR positive and 12 negative patients was classified. According to our study, unilateral (61–67%), multifocal (50–52%), and peripheral (83–91%) involvement were higher in all groups. Lower lobe involvement was frequently detected (58–65%). The most frequently detected parenchymal lesion was ground-glass opacity followed by consolidated areas accompanying ground-grass opacities. Halo sign and vascular enlargement signs were the common signs of lung lesions (35%). In addition, some rare findings not previously described in this disease in children were mentioned in this study. The clinical course of all our patients was mild and control radiological imaging checked by CXR. CONCLUSION: Most pediatric patients have a mild course. Hence, a balance between the risk of radiation and necessity for chest CT is very important.

Anecdotal evidence has described atypical presentations of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in older adults; however, the frequency of and outcomes associated with delirium in older ED patients with COVID-19 infection have not been well described. OBJECTIVE: To determine how frequently older adults with COVID-19 present to the ED with delirium and their associated hospital outcomes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This multicenter cohort study was conducted at 7 sites in the US. Participants included consecutive older adults with COVID-19 presenting to the ED on or after March 13, 2020. EXPOSURE: COVID-19 was diagnosed by positive nasal swab for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (99% of cases) or classic radiological findings (1% of cases). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was delirium as identified from the medical record according to a validated record review approach. RESULTS: A total of 817 older patients with COVID-19 were included, of whom 386 (47%) were male, 493 (62%) were White, 215 (27%) were Black, and 54 (7%) were Hispanic or Latinx. The mean (SD) age of patients was 77.7 (8.2) years. Of included patients, 226 (28%) had delirium at presentation, and delirium was the sixth most common of all presenting symptoms and signs. Among the patients with delirium, 37 (16%) had delirium as a primary symptom and 84 (37%) had no typical COVID-19 symptoms or signs, such as fever or shortness of breath. Factors associated with delirium were age older than 75 years (adjusted relative risk [aRR], 1.51; 95% CI, 1.17-1.95), living in a nursing home or assisted living (aRR, 1.23; 95% CI, 0.98-1.55), prior use of psychoactive medication (aRR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.11-1.81), vision impairment (aRR, 1.98; 95% CI, 1.54-2.54), hearing impairment (aRR, 1.10; 95% CI 0.78-1.55), stroke (aRR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.15-1.88), and Parkinson disease (aRR, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.30-2.58). Delirium was associated with intensive care unit stay (aRR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.30-2.15) and death (aRR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.00-1.55). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study of 817 older adults with COVID-19 presenting to US emergency departments, delirium was common and often was seen without other typical symptoms or signs. In addition, delirium was associated with poor hospital outcomes and death. These findings suggest the clinical importance of including delirium on checklists of presenting signs and symptoms of COVID-19 that guide screening, testing, and evaluation.","Kennedy, Maura; Helfand, Benjamin K.

We aimed to assess the clinical and epidemiological characteristics and the predicting factors related to COVID-19 among HCPs in Egypt. A comparative cross-sectional study was conducted among HCPs via an online questionnaire. Out of 440 responses, a total of 385 complete responses were analyzed. The responders’ mean age was 37.5±9.4 years, 215 (55.8%) of the participants were males. They included 77 (20%) confirmed COVID-19 cases; most of them had mild (58.6%) or moderate symptoms (30%), and (9.1%) were asymptomatic. Almost all sustained infection while on duty (97.4%). The sources of infection were either infected patients (39%), colleagues (22.1%), household contacts (5.2%) or uncertain (33.8%). The sources were symptomatic in only 62.3% of cases. Asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic sources accounted for 37.7% of the cases. Exposure occurred during healthcare provision in 66.3% of the cases. The presence of co-morbidities (OR = 2.53, CI 1.47–4.38, P = 0.001), working more than 8 hours per day in isolation hospital (OR = 3.09, CI 1.02–9.35, P = 0.046), training on hand hygiene (OR = 2.31, CI 1.05–5.08, P = 0.038) and adherence to IPC measures (OR = 2.11, CI 1.16–3.81, P = 0.014) were the significant predictors of COVID-19. In conclusion, COVID-19 occurred in 20% of responders. Silent spread from asymptomatic or presymptomatic patients, and infected colleagues in hospital settings is an alarming sign. Proactive infection prevention and control measures are highly encouraged on both strategic and operational levels.

Virus-specific vaccines and antiviral drugs are the most powerful tools to combat viral diseases. However, broad-spectrum antiviral agents (BSAAs, i.e. compounds targeting viruses belonging to two or more viral families) could provide additional protection of the general population from emerging and re-emerging viral diseases, reinforcing the arsenal of available antiviral options. Here, we review discovery and development of BSAAs and summarize the information on 120 safe-in-man agents in a freely accessible database (https://drugvirus.info/). Future and ongoing pre-clinical and clinical studies will increase the number of BSAAs, expand the spectrum of their indications, and identify drug combinations for treatment of emerging and re-emerging viral infections as well as co-infections.","Andersen, Petter I.; Ianevski, Aleksandr; Lysvand, Hilde; Vitkauskiene, Astra; Oksenych, Valentyn; Bjørås, Magnar; Telling, Kaidi; Lutsar, Irja; Dumpis, Uga; Irie, Yasuhiko; Tenson, Tanel; Kantele, Anu; Kainov, Denis E.",Int J Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.02.018; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S120197122030076X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32081774/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S120197122030076X,175

604086,Advances in Real‐Time PCR: Application to Clinical Laboratory Diagnostics,2006-11-06,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Pulmonary infiltrates are common in immunosuppressed patients. Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is often used to evaluate their aetiology. However, it may not always be easily performed. Thus, alternative diagnostic strategies may be needed. There is limited data on the correlation of nasopharyngeal (NP) respiratory viral panel (RVP)‐PCR testing compared with BAL. We aimed to identify the predictive value of NP RVP‐PCR samples compared with samples obtained from BAL in immunosuppressed patients with pulmonary infiltrates. METHODS: We conducted an observational retrospective study of immunosuppressed adults who underwent bronchoscopy in the Pulmonary Department at the University of Rochester Medical Center between January 2011 and June 2016. We compared the positive and negative predictive values, sensitivity, specificity and false negative rate of NP RVP‐PCR and BAL RVP‐PCR, as well as identified clinical predictors of positive viral BAL RVP‐PCR. RESULTS: Eighty‐nine immunosuppressed patients had both NP and bronchoalveolar RVP‐PCR testing. Twenty‐one patients had NP(+)BAL(+) RVP‐PCR testing. Seven patients had false negative (NP(−)BAL(+)) RVP‐PCR testing. Three patients had NP(+)BAL(−) RVP‐PCR testing. The positive and negative predictive values of NP RVP‐PCR testing were 88% and 89%, respectively. Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation and testing performed in the winter and spring months were significantly associated with positive BAL RVP‐PCR (OR = 3.3 (1.19–9.12); OR = 4.62 (1.64–12.99), respectively). CONCLUSION: NP RVP‐PCR testing has high concordance with testing performed on BAL samples. Repeat testing through BAL is beneficial when there is high concern for viral infection after initial NP RVP‐PCR testing is negative.","Lachant, Daniel J.; Croft, Daniel P.; McGrane Minton, Heather; Prasad, Paritosh; Kottmann, Robert M.",Respirology,https://doi.org/10.1111/resp.13049; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28382762/,175
604087,"Epidemiological study of influenza virus infections in young adult outpatients from Buenos Aires, Argentina",2008-08-03,"Community health worker (CHW) programs are a critical component of health systems, notably in lower- and middle-income countries. However, when policy recommendations exceed what is feasible to implement, CHWs are overstretched by the volume of activities, implementation strength is diluted, and programs fail to produce promised outcomes. To counteract this, we developed a time-use modeling tool—the CHW Coverage and Capacity (C3) Tool—and used it with government partners in Rwanda and Zanzibar to address common policy questions related to CHW needs, coverage, and time optimization. In Rwanda, the C3 Tool was used to analyze 2 well-established cadres of CHWs and 1 new one. The well-established CHW cadres were within a “manageable” workload range whereas the new cadre was projected to achieve less than half of assigned activities. This is informing ongoing changes to the CHWs' scopes of work. In Zanzibar, the C3 Tool was used to update the national community health strategy to include community health volunteers (CHVs) for the first time and determine how many CHVs were needed. The tool projected that 2,200 CHVs could achieve approximately 90% coverage of all defined services. Based on these figures, Zanzibar updated its national community health strategy, which officially launched in February 2020. We discuss lessons from these 2 experiences. Translating analysis into decision making depends not only on the programmatic will and motivation of governments but also on finding opportune timing for when policy and program processes allow for optimization of CHW investments. Further research is needed but our experience supports the value of a modeling tool to ground program plans within estimated constraints on CHW time.","Morrow, Melanie; Sarriot, Eric; Nelson, Allyson R.; Sayinzoga, Felix; Mukamana, Beatrice; Kayitare, Evariste; Khamis, Halima; Abdalla, Omar; Winfrey, William",Glob Health Sci Pract,https://doi.org/10.9745/ghsp-d-20-00324; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33727321/,175

Methods: Six databases were retrieved. The software R 3.6.2 was used for meta-analysis of the included literature. Results: 12 studies were included, which comprise 8996 patients affected with COVID-19 infection. The meta-analysis study found that blood pressure (MAP, SBP and DBP), heart rate, respiration rate and SpO2 are the risk factors for disease progression in patients with COVID-19. Among them, the increase in MAP and the decrease in SpO2 have the greatest impact on the death of patients with COVID-19 [MAP: MD = 5.66, 95% CI (0.34, 10.98), SpO2: MD = -5.87, 95% CI (-9.17, -2.57), P = 0.0005]. However, comparing the body temperature of the death group and the survival group found that the body temperature was not statistically significant between the two groups [body temperature: MD = 0.21, 95% CI (-0.01, 0.43), P = 0.0661]. Conclusion: The increase in MAP, heart rate and respiratory rate, as well as the decrease in SBP, DBP and SpO2 are all independent risk factors for death in patients with COVID-19. These factors are simple and easy to monitor, and individualized treatment can be given to patients in time, reducing the mortality rate and improving treatment efficiency.","Du, M.; Zhao, J.; Yin, X.; Zhang, N.; Zheng, G.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.17.20196709v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.17.20196709,175
606368,Adiponectin Stimulates Exosome Release to Enhance Mesenchymal Stem-Cell-Driven Therapy of Heart Failure in Mice,2020-07-10,"BACKGROUND: Whereas taxation on alcohol is becoming an increasingly common practice in many countries as part of overall public health measures, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government is bucking the trend and lowered its duties on wine and beer by 50 percent in 2007. In 2008, Hong Kong removed all duties on alcohol except for spirits. The aim of this paper is to examine the case of Hong Kong with its history of changes in alcohol taxation to explore the factors that have driven such an unprecedented policy evolution. METHODS: The research is based on an analysis of primary documents. Searches of official government documents, alcohol-related industry materials and other media reports on alcohol taxation for the period from 2000 to 2008 were systematically carried out using key terms such as “alcohol tax” and “alcohol industry”. Relevant documents (97) were indexed by date and topic to undertake a chronological and thematic analysis using Nvivo8 software. RESULTS: Our analysis demonstrates that whereas the city’s changing financial circumstances and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government’s strong propensity towards economic liberalism had, in part, contributed to such dramatic transformation, the alcohol industry’s lobbying tactics and influence were clearly the main drivers of the policy decision. The alcohol industry’s lobbying tactics were two-fold. The first was to forge a coalition encompassing a range of catering and trade industries related to alcohol as well as industry-friendly lawmakers so that these like-minded actors could find common ground in pursuing changes to the taxation policy. The second was to deliberately promote a blend of ideas to garner support from the general public and to influence the perception of key policy makers. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the success of aggressive industry lobbying coupled with the absence of robust public health advocacy was the main driving force behind the unparalleled abolition of wine and beer duties in Hong Kong. Strong public health alliance and advocacy movement are needed to counteract the industry’s continuing aggressive lobby and promotion of alcoholic beverages.","Yoon, Sungwon; Lam, Tai-Hing",BMC Public Health,https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2458-12-717; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22935365/,175

We reviewed medical records of children with MIS-C diagnosis seen at the Children’s Hospital of Michigan in Detroit between April and June 2020. Thirty-three children were identified including 22 who required critical care (group 1) and 11 with less intense inflammation (group 2). Children in group 1 were older (median 7.0 years) than those in group 2 (median 2.0 years). Abdominal pain was present in 68% of patients in group 1. Hypotension or shock was present in 17/22 patients in group 1. Thirteen (39.4%) had Kawasaki disease (KD)–like manifestations. Five developed coronary artery dilatation; All resolved on follow-up. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) was given to all patients in group 1 and 7/11 in group 2. Second-line therapy was needed in 13/22 (group 1) for persisting inflammation or myocardial dysfunction; 12 received infliximab. All patients recovered. Conclusion: MIS-C clinical manifestations may overlap with KD; however, MIS-C is likely a distinct inflammatory process characterized by reversible myocardial dysfunction and rarely coronary artery dilatation. Supportive care, IVIG, and second-line therapy with infliximab were associated with a favorable outcome.","Abdel-Haq, Nahed; Asmar, Basim I.; Deza Leon, Maria P.; McGrath, Eric J.; Arora, Harbir S.; Cashen, Katherine; Tilford, Bradley; Charaf Eddine, Ahmad; Sethuraman, Usha; Ang, Jocelyn Y.",Eur J Pediatr,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00431-021-03935-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33452570/,175

The value of conventional chest radiography (CCR) remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to investigate the diagnostic value of CCR in the detection of COVID-19 through a comparative analysis of CCR and CT. This study included 49 patients with 52 CT images and chest radiographs of pathogen-confirmed COVID-19 cases and COVID-19-suspected cases that were found to be negative (non-COVID-19). The performance of CCR in detecting COVID-19 was compared to CT imaging. The major signatures that allowed for differentiation between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 cases were also evaluated. Approximately 75% (39/52) of images had positive findings on the chest x-ray examinations, while 80.7% (42/52) had positive chest CT scans. The COVID-19 group accounted for 88.4% (23/26) of positive chest X-ray examinations and 96.1% (25/26) of positive chest CT scans. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of CCR for abnormal shadows were 88%, 80%, and 87%, respectively, for all patients. For the COVID-19 group, the accuracy of CCR was 92%. The primary signature on CCR was flocculent shadows in both groups. The shadows were primarily in the bi-pulmonary, which was significantly different from non-COVID-19 patients (p = 0.008). The major CT finding of COVID-19 patients was ground-glass opacities in both lungs, while in non-COVID-19 patients, consolidations combined with ground-glass opacities were more common in one lung than both lungs (p = 0.0001). CCR showed excellent performance in detecting abnormal shadows in patients with confirmed COVID-19. However, it has limited value in differentiating COVID-19 patients from non-COVID-19 patients. Through the typical epidemiological history, laboratory examinations, and clinical symptoms, combined with the distributive characteristics of shadows, CCR may be useful to identify patients with possible COVID-19. This will allow for the rapid identification and quarantine of patients.","Zeng, Fengxia; Cai, Yong; Guo, Yi; Chen, Weiguo; Lin, Min; Zheng, Jun; Zeng, Hui; Wang, Sina; Qin, Genggeng",Science progress,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34424791/; https://doi.org/10.1177/00368504211016204,175

METHODS: This was an observational case–control study of pregnant women who were vaccinated with a two‐dose regimen of the BNT162b2 vaccine during gestation between January and February 2021 (study group) and age‐matched non‐pregnant women who received the vaccine during the same time period (control group). Participants received a digital questionnaire 1–4 weeks after the second dose and were asked to provide information regarding demographics, medication, medical history, history of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) infection, timing of COVID‐19 vaccine doses and side effects after each vaccine dose. A second digital questionnaire, regarding current pregnancy and delivery outcomes, was sent to patients in the study group after the calculated due date. All recruited women were offered a serology blood test for SARS‐CoV‐2 immunoglobulin G (IgG) following the second vaccination dose and SARS‐CoV‐2 IgG levels were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: Of 539 pregnant women who were recruited after completion of the two‐dose regimen of the vaccine, 390 returned the digital questionnaire and were included in the study group and compared to 260 age‐matched non‐pregnant vaccinated women. The rates of rash, fever and severe fatigue following vaccination among pregnant women were comparable to those in non‐pregnant women. Myalgia, arthralgia and headache were significantly less common among pregnant women after each dose, local pain or swelling and axillary lymphadenopathy were significantly less common among pregnant women after the first and second doses, respectively, while paresthesia was significantly more common among the pregnant population after the second dose. Among pregnant women, there were no significant differences in the rates of side effects according to whether the vaccine was administered during the first, second or third trimester of pregnancy, except for local pain/swelling, which was significantly less common after the first dose when administered during the third trimester, and uterine contractions, which were significantly more common after the second dose when administered during the third trimester. The rates of obstetric complications, including uterine contractions (1.3% after the first dose and 6.4% after the second dose), vaginal bleeding (0.3% after the first dose and 1.5% after the second dose) and prelabor rupture of membranes (0% after the first dose and 0.8% after the second dose), were very low following vaccination. All serum samples in both groups were positive for SARS‐CoV‐2 IgG. However, pregnant women had significantly lower serum SARS‐CoV‐2 IgG levels compared to non‐pregnant women (signal‐to‐cut‐off ratio, 27.03 vs 34.35, respectively; P < 0.001). Among the 57 pregnant women who delivered during the study period and who completed the second questionnaire, median gestational age at delivery was 39.5 (interquartile range, 38.7–40.0) weeks, with no cases of preterm birth < 37 weeks, no cases of fetal or neonatal death and two (3.5%) cases of admission to the neonatal intensive care unit for respiratory support. CONCLUSIONS: The adverse‐effect profile and short‐term obstetric and neonatal outcomes among pregnant women who were vaccinated with the BNT162b2 vaccine at any stage of pregnancy do not indicate any safety concerns. The vaccine is effective in generating a humoral immune response in pregnant women, although SARS‐CoV‐2 IgG levels were lower than those observed in non‐pregnant vaccinated women. © 2021 International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology.","Bookstein Peretz, S.; Regev, N.; Novick, L.; Nachshol, M.; Goffer, E.; Ben‐David, A.; Asraf, K.; Doolman, R.; Gal Levin, E.; Regev Yochay, G.; Yinon, Y.",Ultrasound Obstet Gynecol,https://doi.org/10.1002/uog.23729; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34198360/,175

The present review aimed to depict the impact of this pandemic and the lockdown on the livestock and poultry sectors in the country, which has been one of the fastest-growing sectors in recent years. Inadequacy of country-wide information has been a major bottleneck for having a thorough understanding of the impact of the prolonged lockdown on different sub-sectors of livestock and poultry. In the present case, an in-depth analysis of the subject has been made through the collation of available published materials and information collected through public contacts. The pandemic and the associated lockdown has not only caused enormous distress to the millions of poor and marginal farmers for saving their crops and/or livestock and thereby assuring their livelihoods but also impacted the overall poultry, dairy, and other livestock production systems and associated value chains, nutrition and health care, and labor availability. The paper highlights various dimensions of the impacts, namely, reduction in demand of different commodities, wastage of the produce due to the closure of transport and market chains, distress sale of the produce, and labor shortage and revival strategies taken by the government and associated enterprises.

This study was conducted to investigate the association between the outcomes of COVID-19 patients and daily cumulative index (DCI), which was defined as the average daily number of new cases of COVID-19 and calculated by cumulative cases/number of days between the first reported case and March 6, 2020 by country. Spearman's rank correlation analyses were conducted to evaluate the relationship between mortality, incidence, and DCI. In this study, we found that DCI was positively correlated with incidence (adjusted risk ratio [aRR] = 1.01, 95% [confidence interval, CI] = 1.00-1.02, p < 0.01). Higher correlation between mortality and DCI (mortality rate: r = 0.397, p = 0.018; mortality per 1,000,000 people: r = 0.0.428, p = 0.004) was observed than disease incidence.

However, their success may be limited by their relatively poor potency. To address these challenges, we developed a highly active multimeric sACE2 decoy receptor via a SunTag system that could neutralize both pseudoviruses bearing SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and SARS-CoV-2 clinical isolates. This fusion protein demonstrated a neutralization efficiency nearly 250-fold greater than monomeric sACE2. SunTag in combination with a more potent version of sACE2 achieved near complete neutralization at a sub-nanomolar range, which is comparable with clinical monoclonal antibodies. We demonstrate that this activity is due to greater occupancy of the multimeric decoy receptors on Spike protein as compared to monomeric sACE2. Overall, these highly potent multimeric sACE2 decoy receptors offer a promising treatment approach against SARS-CoV-2 infections including its novel variants.","Kayabolen, Alisan; Akcan, Ugur; Ozturan, Dogancan; Sarayloo, Ehsan; Nurtop, Elif; Ozer, Berna; Sahin, Gizem Nur; Dogan, Ozlem; Lack, Nathan; Kaya, Mehmet; Albayrak, Cem; Can, Fusun; Solaroglu, Ihsan; Bagci-Onder, Tugba",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.04.425128,175

METHODS: Cross-sectional online survey of parents with children < 18 years old in Chicago and Cook County, Illinois, in June 2020. We used logistic regression to determine the odds of parental COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy (VH) for racial/ethnic and socioeconomic groups, controlling for sociodemographic factors and the sources where parents obtain information regarding COVID-19. RESULTS: Surveys were received from 1702 parents and 1425 were included in analyses. Overall, 33% of parents reported VH for their child. COVID-19 VH was higher among non-Hispanic Black parents compared with non-Hispanic White parents (Odds Ratio (OR) 2.65, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): (1.99–3.53), parents of publicly insured children compared with privately insured (OR 1.93, (1.53–2.42)) and among lower income groups. Parents receive information about COVID-19 from a variety of sources, and those who report using family, internet and health care providers as information sources (compared to those who don’t use each respective source) had lower odds of COVID-19 VH for their children. CONCLUSIONS: The highest rates of hesitancy toward a future COVID-19 vaccine were found in demographic groups that have been the most severely affected by the pandemic. These groups may require targeted outreach efforts from trusted sources of information in order to promote equitable uptake of a future COVID-19 vaccine.","Alfieri, Nina L.; Kusma, Jennifer D.; Heard-Garris, Nia; Davis, Matthew M.; Golbeck, Emily; Barrera, Leonardo; Macy, Michelle L.",BMC Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34517848/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-11725-5,175

Here, we characterised socio-demographics and comorbidity in 3,316,107persons tested and 219,072 persons tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 since January 2020, and their key health outcomes in the month following the first positive test. Routine care data from primary care electronic health records (EHR) from Spain, hospital EHR from the United States (US), and claims data from South Korea and the US were used. The majority of study participants were women aged 18–65 years old. Positive/tested ratio varied greatly geographically (2.2:100 to 31.2:100) and over time (from 50:100 in February-April to 6.8:100 in May-June). Fever, cough and dyspnoea were the most common symptoms at presentation. Between 4%−38% required admission and 1–10.5% died within a month from their first positive test. Observed disparity in testing practices led to variable baseline characteristics and outcomes, both nationally (US) and internationally.

Understanding how viruses co-evolve with their hosts is a fundamental topic in molecular evolution and may also aid in developing novel viral based applications such as vaccines, oncologic therapies, and anti-bacterial treatments. Here, based on a novel statistical framework and a large-scale genomic analysis of 2,625 viruses from all classes infecting 439 host organisms from all kingdoms of life, we identify short nucleotide sequences that are under-represented in the coding regions of viruses and their hosts. These sequences cannot be explained by the coding regions’ amino acid content, codon, and dinucleotide frequencies. We specifically show that short homooligonucleotide and palindromic sequences tend to be under-represented in many viruses probably due to their effect on gene expression regulation and the interaction with the host immune system. In addition, we show that more sequences tend to be under-represented in dsDNA viruses than in other viral groups. Finally, we demonstrate, based on in vitro and in vivo experiments, how under-represented sequences can be used to attenuated Zika virus strains.","Zarai, Yoram; Zafrir, Zohar; Siridechadilok, Bunpote; Suphatrakul, Amporn; Roopin, Modi; Julander, Justin; Tuller, Tamir",DNA Res,https://doi.org/10.1093/dnares/dsaa008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32339222/,175

Bovine coronavirus (BCoV) infects cattle and wild ruminants, both as a respiratory and enteric pathogen, and possesses a significant economic threat to the cattle industry. Transcription factors are proteins that activate or inhibit transcription through DNA binding and have become new targets for disease therapies. This study utilized in silico tools to identify potential transcription factors that can serve as biomarkers for regulation of BCoV pathogenesis in cattle, both for testing and treatment. A total of 11 genes were identified as significantly expressed during BCoV infection through literature searches and functional analyses. Eleven transcription factors were predicted to target those genes (AREB6, YY1, LMO2, C-Rel, NKX2-5, E47, RORAlpha1, HLF, E4BP4, ARNT, CREB). Function, network, and phylogenetic analyses established the significance of many transcription factors within the immune response. This study establishes new information on the transcription factors and genes related to host-pathogen interactome in BCoV infection, particularly transcription factors YY1, AREB6, LMO2, and NKX2, which appear to have strong potential as diagnostic markers, and YY1 as a potential target for drug therapies.","Morenikeji, Olanrewaju B.; Strutton, Ellis; Wallace, Madeleine; Bernard, Kahleel; Yip, Elaine; Thomas, Bolaji N.",Microorganisms,https://doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms8091323; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32872640/,175

We investigated associations between environmental factors and current/expected health behaviors of German freshmen during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: A cross-sectional survey design was used. A total of N = 208 students (82.7% female; M age = 20.90, SD = 4.10) completed an online questionnaire assessing health behaviors and environmental factors at the beginning of their first semester. RESULTS: Current and expected physical activity was associated to that of all social ties, current and expected alcohol use to partner's and peers’ alcohol use, while current and expected eating was only associated to peers’ eating. The relationship between partner's or peers’ and participant's alcohol use was moderated by coresidence, with a greater probability of engaging in these behaviors observed in case of coresidence. Perceived peer encouragement for alcohol consumption moderated the relationship between peer alcohol use and the number of drinks consumed by participants per month. Participants who spend more time with peers were more likely to consume higher amounts of alcohol. No differences were found regarding present and expected behaviors of participants who moved out of their parents’ home and those who did not. CONCLUSION: Partners and peers significantly influence students’ health behaviors, particularly alcohol use. Interventions to prevent health risk behaviors among freshmen should therefore address these social ties’ influence.","Gesualdo, Chrys; Pinquart, Martin",Health Psychology and Behavioral Medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34285824/; https://doi.org/10.1080/21642850.2021.1947291,175
613733,Comparing the Cobas Liat Influenza A/B and respiratory syncytial virus assay with multiplex nucleic acid testing,2018-11-13,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic is the greatest public health crisis of the last 100 years. Countries have responded with various levels of lockdown to save lives and stop health systems from being overwhelmed. At the same time, lockdowns entail large socioeconomic costs. One exit strategy under consideration is a mobile phone app that traces the close contacts of those infected with COVID-19. Recent research has demonstrated the theoretical effectiveness of this solution in different disease settings. However, concerns have been raised about such apps because of the potential privacy implications. This could limit the acceptability of app-based contact tracing in the general population. As the effectiveness of this approach increases strongly with app uptake, it is crucial to understand public support for this intervention. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to investigate the user acceptability of a contact-tracing app in five countries hit by the pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a largescale, multicountry study (N=5995) to measure public support for the digital contact tracing of COVID-19 infections. We ran anonymous online surveys in France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom, and the United States. We measured intentions to use a contact-tracing app across different installation regimes (voluntary installation vs automatic installation by mobile phone providers) and studied how these intentions vary across individuals and countries. RESULTS: We found strong support for the app under both regimes, in all countries, across all subgroups of the population, and irrespective of regional-level COVID-19 mortality rates. We investigated the main factors that may hinder or facilitate uptake and found that concerns about cybersecurity and privacy, together with a lack of trust in the government, are the main barriers to adoption. CONCLUSIONS: Epidemiological evidence shows that app-based contact tracing can suppress the spread of COVID-19 if a high enough proportion of the population uses the app and that it can still reduce the number of infections if uptake is moderate. Our findings show that the willingness to install the app is very high. The available evidence suggests that app-based contact tracing may be a viable approach to control the diffusion of COVID-19.","Altmann, Samuel; Milsom, Luke; Zillessen, Hannah; Blasone, Raffaele; Gerdon, Frederic; Bach, Ruben; Kreuter, Frauke; Nosenzo, Daniele; Toussaert, Séverine; Abeler, Johannes",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32759102/; https://doi.org/10.2196/19857,175

614688,A highly specific ratiometric two-photon fluorescent probe to detect dipeptidyl peptidase IV in plasma and living systems,2017-04-15,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic began in December 2019. While it has not yet ended, COVID-19 has already created transitions in health care, one of which is a decrease in medical use for health-related issues other than COVID-19 infection. Korean soldiers are relatively homogeneous in terms of age and physical condition. They show a similar disease distribution pattern every year and are directly affected by changes in government attempts to control COVID-19 with nonpharmaceutical interventions. This study aimed to identify the changes in patterns of outpatient visits and admissions to military hospitals for a range of disease types during a pandemic. METHODS: Outpatient attendance and admission data from all military hospitals in South Korea from January 2016 to December 2020 were analyzed. Only active enlisted soldiers aged 18–32 years were included. Outpatient visits where there was a diagnosis of pneumonia, acute upper respiratory tract infection, infectious conjunctivitis, infectious enteritis, asthma, allergic rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis, atopic dermatitis, urticaria, and fractures were analyzed. Admissions for pneumonia, acute enteritis, and fractures were also analyzed. All outpatient visits and admissions in 2020 for each disease were counted on a weekly basis and compared with the average number of visits over the same period of each year from 2016 to 2019. The corrected value was calculated by dividing the ratio of total weekly number of outpatient visits or admissions to the corresponding medical department in 2020 to the average in 2016–2019. RESULTS: A total of 5,813,304 cases of outpatient care and 143,022 cases of admission were analyzed. For pneumonia, the observed and corrected numbers of outpatient visits and admissions in 2020 decreased significantly compared with the average of other years (P < 0.001). The results were similar for outpatient visits for acute upper respiratory tract infection and infectious conjunctivitis (P < 0.001), while the corrected number of outpatient visits for infectious enteritis showed a significant increase in 2020 (P = 0.005). The corrected number of outpatient visits for asthma in 2020 did not differ from the average of the previous 4 years but the number of visits for the other allergic diseases increased significantly (P < 0.001). For fractures, the observed and corrected numbers of outpatient visits and admissions in 2020 decreased significantly compared with the average of other years (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, outpatient visits to military hospitals for respiratory and conjunctival infections and fractures decreased, whereas visits for allergic diseases did not change or increased only slightly. Admissions for pneumonia decreased significantly in 2020, while those for acute enteritis and fractures also decreased, but showed an increased proportion compared with previous years. These results are important because they illustrate the changing patterns in lifestyle as a result of public encouragement to adopt nonpharmaceutical interventions during the pandemic and their effect on medical needs for both infectious and noninfectious diseases in a select group.","Yoon, Doran; Kim, Kyoung-Eun; Lee, Ji Eun; Kim, Mirang; Kim, Jung-Hyun",J Korean Med Sci,https://doi.org/10.3346/jkms.2021.36.e204; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34282607/,175

In the current study, this method was used to detect and classify IB viruses in field submissions. Procedure Over an 11‐month period samples from 40 cases of suspected IB virus were received and 17 submissions were positive for IB virus by polymerase chain reaction. HRM curve analysis classified each strain as subgroup 1, 2 or 3 strain (12 submissions) or a strain that was unable to be classified (5 submissions). The 3′ untranslated region (UTR) and partial S1 gene nucleotide sequences for the 17 IB virus strains were determined and their identity with those of the relative reference strains compared to confirm the classifications generated using the HRM curve analysis. Results Of the 12 IB field viruses classified as subgroup 1, 2, or 3 using HRM curve analysis, the 3′UTR and S1 gene nucleotide sequences had identities ≥99% with the respective subgroup reference strain. Analysis of the 3′ UTR and S1 gene nucleotide sequences for the five IB virus strains that could not be classified indicated that four belonged to one of the subgroups, and one was a potential recombinant strain (between strains from subgroups 2 and 3). A novel recombinant strain was also detected. Conclusion HRM curve analysis can rapidly assign the majority of IB viruses present in field submissions to known subgroups.

Two days before VAP onset we observed a transcriptional signature of bacterial infection. Two weeks prior to VAP onset, following intubation, we observed a striking impairment in immune signaling in COVID-19 patients who developed VAP. Longitudinal metatranscriptomic analysis revealed disruption of lung microbiome community composition in patients with VAP, providing a connection between dysregulated immune signaling and outgrowth of opportunistic pathogens. These findings suggest that COVID-19 patients who develop VAP have impaired antibacterial immune defense detectable weeks before secondary infection onset.","Tsitsiklis, Alexandra; Zha, Beth; Byrne, Ashley; DeVoe, Catherine; Levan, Sophia; Rackaityte, Elze; Sunshine, Sara; Mick, Eran; Ghale, Rajani; Jauregui, Alejandra; Neff, Norma; Sarma, Aartik; Serpa, Paula; Deiss, Thomas; Kistler, Amy; Carrillo, Sidney; Ansel, K.

It is known that trypsin, after such interaction, possesses modified proteolytic activity. Trypsin first hydrolyzes two bonds in A2M's 'bait region', and the peptide 705VGFYESDVMGR715 is released from A2M. In this work, specifics of the A2M-trypsin interaction were used to determine A2M concentration directly in human blood serum using MALDI mass-spectrometry. Following exogenous addition of trypsin to human blood serum in vitro, the concentration of the VGFYESDVMGR peptide was measured, using its isotopically-labeled analogue (18O), and A2M concentration was calculated. The optimized mass spectrometric approach was verified using a standard method for A2M concentration determination (ELISA) and the relevant statistical analysis methods. It was also shown that trypsin's modified proteolytic activity in the presence of serum A2M can be used to analyze other serum proteins, including potential biomarkers of pathological processes.

METHODS: We therefore conducted this multicentre retrospective study and collected data of middle-aged COVID-19 patients without comorbidities at admission from three designated hospitals in China. RESULTS: Among 119 middle-aged patients without comorbidities, 18 (15.1%) developed into severe illness and 5 (3.9%) died in hospital. ARDS (26, 21.8%) and elevated D-dimer (36, 31.3%) were the most common complications, while other organ complications were relatively rare. Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of severe illness associated with neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR, OR, 11.238; 95% CI 1.110–1.382; p < 0.001) and D-dimer greater than 1 µg/ml (OR, 16.079; 95% CI 3.162–81.775; p = 0.001) on admission. The AUCs for the NLR, D-dimer greater than 1 µg/ml and combined NLR and D-dimer index were 0.862 (95% CI, 0.751–0.973), 0.800 (95% CI 0.684–0.915) and 0.916 (95% CI, 0.855–0.977), respectively. SOFA yielded an AUC of 0.750 (95% CI 0.602–0.987). There was significant difference in the AUC between SOFA and combined index (z = 2.574, p = 0.010). CONCLUSIONS: More attention should be paid to the monitoring and early treatment of respiratory and coagulation abnormalities in middle-aged COVID-19 patients without comorbidities. In addition, the combined NLR and D-dimer higher than 1 μg/ml index might be a potential and reliable predictor for the incidence of severe illness in this specific patient with COVID-19, which could guide clinicians on early classification and management of patients, thereby relieving the shortage of medical resource. However, it is warranted to validate the reliability of the predictor in larger sample COVID-19 patients.","Wang, Peng; Sha, Jing; Meng, Mei; Wang, Cuiyan; Yao, Qingchun; Zhang, Zhongfa; Sun, Wenqing; Wang, Xingguang; Qie, Guoqiang; Bai, Xue; Liu, Keke; Chu, Yufeng",J Transl Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33287826/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12967-020-02655-8,175

However, it remained unclear how effectively measures reduced the spread of the virus, due to data complications. We examined how the effective-contact rate (ECR) among European citizens evolved over the period with implemented measures using a new data-oriented approach that is based on an extended Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model. Methods Using the available data on the confirmed numbers of infections and hospitalizations, we first estimated the daily number of infectious-, exposed- and susceptible individuals and subsequently estimated the ECR with an iterative Poisson regression model, disregarding information on governmental measures. We then studied change points in the daily ECRs to the moments of the governmental measures. Results The change points in the daily ECRs were found to align with the implementation of governmental interventions. At the end of the considered time-window, we found similar ECRs for Italy (0{middle dot}29), Spain (0{middle dot}24), and Germany (0{middle dot}27), while the ECR in the Netherlands (0{middle dot}34), Belgium (0{middle dot}35) and the UK (0{middle dot}37) were somewhat higher. The highest ECR was found for Sweden (0{middle dot}45). Interpretation There seemed to be an immediate effect of banning events and closing schools, typically among the first measures taken by the governments. The effect of additionally closing bars and restaurants seemed limited. For most countries a somewhat delayed effect of the full lockdown was observed, and the ECR after a full lockdown was not necessarily lower than an ECR after (only) a gathering ban.","Post, R. A.

In a proof of concept experiment, next generation sequencing approaches, accompanied by the development of novel computational and bioinformatics tools, were utilized to examine the evolution of the microbial ecology of the avian trachea during the growth of a healthy commercial broiler flock. The flock was sampled weekly, beginning at placement and concluding at 49 days, the day before processing. Metagenomic sequencing of DNA and RNA was utilized to examine the bacteria, virus, bacteriophage, and fungal components during flock growth. The utility of using a metagenomic approach to study the avian respiratory virome was confirmed by detecting the dysbiosis in the avian respiratory virome of broiler chickens diagnosed with infection with infectious laryngotracheitis virus. This study provides the first comprehensive analysis of the ecology of the avian respiratory microbiome and demonstrates the feasibility for the use of this approach in future investigations of avian respiratory diseases.","Mulholland, Kelly A.; Robinson, Monique G.; Keeler, Sharon J.; Johnson, Timothy J.; Weber, Bonnie W.; Keeler, Calvin L.",Microorganisms,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33807233/; https://doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms9040721,175

We analysed the performance of National Early Warning Score (NEWS2) during the first phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Adult non-elective admissions discharged between 11-March-2020 to 13-June-2020 with an index NEWS2 electronically recorded within 24 hours of admission are used to predict mortality at four time points (in-hospital, 24hours, 48hours, and 72hours) in COVID-19 versus non-COVID-19 admissions. Results: Out of 6480 non-elective admissions, 620 (9.6%) had a diagnosis of COVID-19. They were older (73.3 vs 67.7yrs), more often male (54.7% vs 50.1%), had higher index NEWS (4 vs 2.5) and NEWS2 (4.6 vs 2.8) scores and higher in-hospital mortality (32.1% vs 5.8%). The c-statistics for predicting in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 admissions was significantly lower using NEWS (0.64 vs 0.74) or NEWS2 (0.64 vs 0.74), however these differences reduced at 72hours (NEWS: 0.75 vs 0.81; NEWS2: 0.71 vs 0.81), 48 hours (NEWS: 0.78 vs 0.81; NEWS2: 0.76 vs 0.82) and 24hours (NEWS: 0.84 vs 0.84; NEWS2: 0.86 vs 0.84). Increasing NEWS2 values reflected increased mortality, but for any given value the absolute risk was on average 24% higher (e.g.NEWS2=5: 36% vs 9%). Interpretation: NEWS2 is a valid predictor of the mortality risk but substantially underestimates the absolute mortality risk in COVID-19 patients.

621266,Replication and Clearance of Respiratory Syncytial Virus : Apoptosis Is an Important Pathway of Virus Clearance after Experimental Infection with Bovine Respiratory Syncytial Virus,2002-12-11,"Background: Recently, two ""Coronavirus disease 2019"" (COVID-19) vaccine products have been authorized in Canada. It is of crucial importance to model an integrated/combined package of non-pharmaceutical (physical/social distancing) and pharmaceutical (immunization) public health control measures. Methods: A modified epidemiological, compartmental SIR model was utilized and fit to the cumulative COVID-19 case data for the province of Ontario, Canada, from September 8, 2020 to December 8, 2020. Different vaccine roll-out strategies were simulated until 75 percent of the population is vaccinated, including a no-vaccination scenario. We compete these vaccination strategies with relaxation of non-pharmaceutical interventions. Non-pharmaceutical interventions were supposed to remain enforced and began to be relaxed on either January 31, March 31, or May 1, 2021. Results: Based on projections from the data and long-term extrapolation of scenarios, relaxing the public health measures implemented by re-opening too early would cause any benefits of vaccination to be lost by increasing case numbers, increasing the effective reproduction number above 1 and thus increasing the risk of localized outbreaks. If relaxation is, instead, delayed and 75 percent of the Ontarian population gets vaccinated by the end of the year, re-opening can occur with very little risk. Interpretation: Relaxing non-pharmaceutical interventions by re-opening and vaccine deployment is a careful balancing act. Our combination of model projections from data and simulation of different strategies and scenarios, can equip local public health decision- and policy-makers with projections concerning the COVID-19 epidemiological trend, helping them in the decision-making process.","Betti, M.; Bragazzi, N.; Heffernan, J.; Kong, J.

The current multicenter, cross-sectional study aimed at highlighting gaps in antimicrobial (AM) stewardship and AMR among practicing doctors working in public tertiary care teaching hospitals of Lahore, Pakistan. A KAP survey, based on a self-administered questionnaire containing 45 questions, was distributed among 336 clinicians in 6 randomly selected hospitals. Overall, 92% of the clinicians considered AMR as a worldwide problem but only 66% disagreed that cold and flu symptoms require antibiotics. Moreover, around 68% of the doctors felt confident about their practice in AM but still, 96% felt the need to get more knowledge about AM drugs. The need for refresher courses on rational antibiotic use was expressed by 84% of the participants. The main contributing factors considered for AMR by the doctors included excessive AM usage in the medical profession (87.1%) and multiple antibiotics per prescription (76.4%). Pharmacologically, AM spectrum was accurately chosen by 1.4% for Ampicillin, 0.003% for Erythromycin and 0% for Levofloxacin. Clinically, more than 50% of the clinicians used miscellaneous AM for empirical therapy of respiratory tract infection and cholecystitis. The data was analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 25. It is concluded that the knowledge of clinicians is relatively poor for AM spectrum and drugs of choice for certain infections. However, the clinicians are aware of their shortcomings and desire for improvement.","Ashraf, Sohaib; Ashraf, Shoaib; Ashraf, Moneeb; Imran, Muhammad Ahmad; Choudhary, Zawar Ahmad; Hafsa, Hadiqa Tul; Awais, Abeer Bin; Kalsoom, Larab; Farooq, Iqra; Habib, Zaighum; Ashraf, Sidra; Iqbal, Qurrat Ul Ain; Ghufran, Muhammad; Sherazi, Syed Sami Hussain; Akram, Muhammad Kiwan; Akmal, Rutaba; Rafique, Sundas; Nawaz, Khawar; Safdar, Zartasha; Siddique, Uzma Nasim; Hassan, Muhammad; Arshad, Shahroze; Virk, Abdul Rehman; Ashraf, Muhammad; Saboor, Qazi Abdul; Humayun, Ayesha; Izhar, Mateen",Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-16178-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34490566/,175

This study examined the psychosocial and demographic factors associated with nurse's resilience in the hospitals of Ahvaz that is one of the top cities infected with COVID-19 in Iran. Methods: The present cross-sectional study was conducted on 387 Iranian nurses in Ahvaz city. For data collection purposes, three online questionnaires (including Copenhagen Psychosocial, Demographic, and Connor–Davidson Resilience Scale) were distributed among the participants. Results: The mean resilience score was equal to 61.8 ± 14.8 for 387 nurses. Resilience had a statistically significant negative correlation with quantitative demand (r = −0.273, P < 0.008), work pace (r = −0.262, P < 0.011), emotional demand (r = −0.226, P < 0.030), stress (r = −0.458, P < 0.000), and burnout (r = −0.287, P < 0.005). Multiple linear regression analysis indicated that stress, job satisfaction, burnout and age were the main predictors of nurses' resilience during the (COVID-19) pandemic (R(2) = 0.45). Conclusions: We identified psychosocial and demographic predictive factors that may contribute to greater resilience among nurses during the COVID-19 outbreak.

Quantitative studies of parental experiences post-discharge have previously reported elevated levels depressive symptoms, posttraumatic stress-disorder and anxiety among the parents. The current investigation aims to qualitatively explore the situation for parents of children born EPT in Sweden during the first year at home. Semi-structured interviews were performed with 17 parents of 14 children born EPT; eight parents were from an early intervention group and nine parents from a group that received treatment as usual, with extended follow-up procedures. Three main themes were identified using a thematic analytic approach: child-related concerns, the inner state of the parent, and changed family dynamics. Parents in the intervention group also expressed themes related to the intervention, as a sense of security and knowledgeable interventionists. The results are discussed in relation to different concepts of health, parent–child interaction and attachment, and models of the recovery processes. In conclusion, parents describe the first year at home as a time of prolonged parental worries for the child as well as concerns regarding the parent’s own emotional state.","Baraldi, Erika; Allodi, Mara Westling; Smedler, Ann-Charlotte; Westrup, Björn; Löwing, Kristina; Ådén, Ulrika",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17249326; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33322234/,175
623408,Aberrant cytokine milieu and signaling affect immune cell phenotypes and functions in tuberculosis pathology: What can we learn from this phenomenon for application to inflammatory syndromes?,2021-05-25,"BACKGROUD: Countless efforts to combat sexual harassment have been proposed, and for the first time in history, the second order of sexual harassment (SOSH) has been legislated under the term second-order violence (SOV) by a unanimous vote of the Catalan Parliament. Advances in preventing and responding to sexual harassment contribute to highlighting the intervention as being crucial to supporting survivors against retaliation. A lack of support provides a general explanation on why bystanders tend not to intervene and highlights the reality that reprisals are suffered by those who support victims. METHODS: From the existing knowledge about sexual harassment prevention and response mechanisms, this paper analyzes scientific evidence through a review of the literature published in databases, as well as legislation, reports, and other materials. RESULTS: The context that enables SOV legislation is grounded in three realms: (1) bystander intervention and protection, (2) the role of support networks in protecting survivors, and (3) awareness and legislation of SOSH. An active bystander refers to the involvement of someone who is aware of potential sexual harassment situations. CONCLUSIONS: The lack of legislation against SOSH limits bystander intervention and support; therefore, legislating protection for supporters has become urgent and necessary. Legislating SOSH has great social implications because gender equality cannot be fully achieved if bystander protection is not legally considered. Policy Implications: As no legal system has previously contemplated SOSH, its pioneering parliamentarian approval and establishment by Catalan law constitute a legal key innovation for the field of gender and women’s studies. In fact, evidence reported here are important in developing further regulations and policy.

The extistence of over 100 immunologically distinct serotypes makes serotype specific assays, such as ELISA, unsuitable for general diagnostic assays. In this study a general rhinovirus assay is described which utilises synthetic oligonucleotides as probes in a filter hybridization assay. The probes are designed to bind to short but highly conserved regions of the rhinovirus genome. Indeed, the probes successfully detected all 57 rhinovirus serotypes tested. Furthermore, the test was used to demonstrate rhinovirus infection in clinical samples from 57 volunteers, inoculated with HRV, collected on six consecutive days. Clinical samples were taken prior to inoculation and on days 2–7 after inoculation. The filter hybridization assay gave results comparable to virus culture on days 2 and 3 post-inoculation, but was more sensitive on subsequent days.","Bruce, Christine B.; Al-Nakib, W.; Almond, J.

Healthcare workers are a vulnerable cohort for SARS-CoV-2 infection due to frequent and close contact to patients with COVID-19. STUDY DESIGN: Serum samples from 316 healthcare workers of the University Hospital Essen, Germany were tested for SARS-CoV-2-IgG antibodies. A questionnaire was used to collect demographic and clinical data. Healthcare workers were grouped depending on the frequency of contact to COVID-19 patients in high-risk-group (n = 244) with daily contact to known or suspected SARS-CoV-2 positive patients, intermediated-risk-group (n = 37) with daily contact to patients without known or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection at admission and low-risk-group (n = 35) without patient contact. RESULTS: In 5 of 316 (1.6%) healthcare workers SARS-CoV-2-IgG antibodies could be detected.

However, there is a paucity of data regarding long-term CT findings in survivors after SARS. The aim of this study was to assess the changes in lung function and lung thin-section computed tomography (CT) features in patients recovering from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), especially the dynamic changes in ground-glass opacity (GGO). MATERIAL/METHODS: Clinical and radiological data from 11 patients with SARS were collected. The serial follow-up thin-section CTs were evaluated at 3, 6, and 84 months after SARS presentation. The distribution and predominant thin-section CT findings of lesions were evaluated. RESULTS: The extent of the lesions on the CT scans of the 11 patients decreased at 6 and 84 months compared to 3 months. The number of segments involved on 84-month follow-up CTs was less than those at 6 months (P<0.05). The predominant thin-section CT manifestation at 84 months (intralobular and interlobular septal thickening) was different than that at 6 months, at which GGO was predominant. CONCLUSIONS: During convalescence after SARS, GGO and intralobular and interlobular septal thickening were the main thin-section CT manifestation. Intralobular and interlobular septal thickening predominated over GGO at 84 months.","Wu, Xiaohua; Dong, Dawei; Ma, Daqing",Med Sci Monit,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27501327/,175

MATERIALS AND METHODS: An anonymous survey consisting of 23 questions regarding the lives of radiation oncologists during the COVID-19 pandemic was distributed online via social media from July 14 to July 21, 2020. Statistical analysis was performed with Statistical Package for the Social Sciences 18.0 software and basic descriptive statistics were applied. RESULTS: A total of 82 radiation oncologists responded to the survey. The majority were professors (28/82; 34.1%) and residents (28/82; 34.1%) and <50 years old (70/82; 85.4%). Cancer screening programs (57/62; 91.9%) and number of new cases reduced (44/82; 53.7%) in many institutes. Follow-up was still done in-person by 73.2% respondents. 35/82 (42.7%) respondents were satisfied about their safety during COVID-19, at the same time 36/82 (43.9%) were worried about the patient’s safety. The fear of contracting COVID-19 (57/82; 69.5%) and infecting their families (64/82; 78%) was high. Physical presence during case implementation (59/82; 72%) and daily setup verification (60/82; 73.2%) remained the same during COVID-19. Half of the respondents adopted new fractionation schedules, commonly in breast and palliative cases. Time spent on research had reduced by 62.2%. Only 41.4% respondents were satisfied with the patient care provided by them during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 has significantly altered the work routine, radiotherapy practice and mental state of radiation oncologists.","Selvaraja, Vinodh Kumar; Gudipudib, Deleep Kumar",Ecancermedicalscience,https://doi.org/10.3332/ecancer.2021.1165; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33680079/,175

No published guidelines on SBOHP implementation existed. Our work describes how philanthropic, public, and academic organizations partnered to support dental safety net providers with designing comprehensive SBOHPs in North and South Carolina. DESCRIPTION: A multi-sector leadership team was established to manage a new SBOHP philanthropic-funded grant program organized into two phases, Readiness and Implementation, with the former a 6-month planning period in preparation of the latter. Readiness included technical assistance (TA) delivered through coaching and 15 online learning modules organized in four domains: operations, finance, enabling services, and impact. Organizations could apply for implementation grants after successful TA completion. Process evaluation was used including a Readiness Stoplight Report for tracking progression. ASSESSMENT: Ten Readiness grantees completed the TA. A variety of models resulted, including mobile, portable and fixed clinics. Descriptive analysis was conducted on the readiness stoplight reports. Components of the operation and finance domains required were the most time-intensive, specifically the development of policy manuals, production goals, and financial performance tracking. CONCLUSION: The program’s structure resulted in (a) a two-state learning community, (b) SBOHP practice and policy alignment, and (c) coordinated program distribution. TA improvements are planned to account for COVID-19 threats, including school closures, space limitations, and transmission fears. Telehealth, non-aerosolizing procedures, and improved scheduling and communication can address concerns. Organizations considering SBOHPs should explore similar recommendations to navigate adverse circumstances.","Martin, Amy B.; Moss, Mark E.; Kelly, Abby; Riley, Amah; Pardi, Vanessa; Pollard, Anna Chandler",Matern Child Health J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33948828/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10995-021-03167-7,175
629606,SARS-CoV-2 detected in olfactory neurons,2021-01-04,"Background Until pharmaceutical measures are widely available to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2, social distancing strategies are key to avert overwhelmed health systems. Since schools host large numbers of students in enclosed spaces, they are feared to produce infection clusters. With school closures coming at high social and economic costs, social distancing measures within schools are needed to make them as safe as possible. One widely discussed distancing measure in the school context is to use cohorting strategies, i.e., to split larger clusters such as classrooms into smaller groups that are instructed separately. In addition to facilitating social distancing within these cohorts, cohorting strategies also aim to prevent transmission across cohorts. However, little is known about which cohorting strategies are particularly effective to prevent disease transmission between cohorts in schools. Methods Using nationally representative data on adolescents in classrooms in four European countries, we simulate how four different cohorting strategies can mitigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in high schools. We model the effect of forming two cohorts randomly, splitting cohorts by gender, optimizing cohorts by minimizing students' out-of-school cross-cohort contacts, and approximating this optimization strategy by network chains. The rationale of all non-random cohorting strategies is to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 from one cohort to the other by reducing cross-cohort out-of-school contact. We also compare the overall effect of cohorting to no cohorting and differentiate between a rota-system in which cohorts receive in-person instruction in alternating weeks and a system with separate but same-day in-person instruction for both cohorts. Data were collected between 2010 and 2011 as part of the CILS4EU project, a network panel study of 14-15-year-olds in England, Germany, the Netherlands, and Sweden. Across all four countries, we model the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in 507 classrooms, capturing a total of 12,291 students. Findings Our simulations suggest that all four cohorting strategies reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in classrooms, but vary in their effectiveness. Relative to random cohorting, all strategies that factor in out-of-school cross-cohort ties have particularly strong effects on the frequency of cross-cohort transmission but also substantively reduce the total number of infections and the share of students in quarantine when transmission dynamics are strong. Cohorting that explicitly minimizes out-of-school contact between students in different cohorts is most effective, but network-based approximation also breaks many cross-cohort ties and thus performs well. Because adolescents' out-of-school contacts tend to be strongly segregated by gender, dividing classrooms by gender also outperforms random cohorting but is less effective than directly using network information. For all cohorting strategies, rota-systems with instruction in alternating weeks contain outbreaks more effectively than same-day in-person instruction. Interpretation Cohorting of school classes as a social distancing measure can help to effectively curb SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks in the school context. If schools consider splitting up classes into two smaller cohorts, factoring in out-of-school contacts can help achieve a more effective separation of cohorts. The paper proposes effective cohorting strategies that outperform naive random cohorting in preventing the spread of SARS-CoV-2. These strategies may limit outbreaks to one cohort, keep the size of infection clusters low, and reduce the number of students in quarantine if an index case occurs in the student body. Our findings thus suggest that if schools consider cohorting, they should assign students who meet after school to the same cohort. In particular, cohorting on the basis of gender or network chains is effective and may be successfully implemented within the constraints posed by the classroom context.","Kaiser, A.

629803,Latent Adenovirus Infection in COPD,2015-12-16,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) is a global pandemic caused by a novel coronavirus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2). To date, the virus has been detected in 219 countries of the world. Therefore, managing the disease becomes the priority, in which detecting the presence of the virus is a crucial step. Presently, real‐time RT polymerase chain reaction (RT‐qPCR) is considered a gold standard nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT). The test protocol of RT‐qPCR is complicated, places high demands on equipment, testing reagents, research personnel skills and is expensive. Therefore, simpler point‐of‐care (POC) tests are needed to accelerate clinical decision‐making and take some of the workload from centralized test laboratories. Various isothermal amplification‐based assays have been developed for the sensitive detection of different microorganisms, and recently some of them have been applied for detection of SARS‐CoV‐2. These do not require any programable thermocycler, can produce the results in a single temperature, and therefore, are considered simple. Unlike RT‐qPCR, these methods are highly sensitive, specific, less time‐consuming, simple and affordable, and can be used as POC diagnostic kit for COVID‐19. In this review, we have discussed the potential of isothermal amplification‐based assays as an alternative to RT‐qPCR for the detection of SARS‐CoV‐2.","Maiti, Biswajit; Anupama, Karanth Padyana; Rai, Praveen; Karunasagar, Indrani; Karunasagar, Iddya",Rev Med Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34216498/; https://doi.org/10.1002/rmv.2274,175
629915,Detection of serum neopterin for early assessment of dengue virus infection,2006-01-18,"Many new innovative diagnostic approaches have been made available during the last 10 years with major impact on patient care and public health surveillance. In parallel, to enhance the cost-effectiveness of the clinical microbiology laboratories (CMLs), European laboratory professionals have streamlined their organization leading to amalgamation of activities and restructuring of their professional relationships with clinicians and public health specialists. Through this consolidation process, an operational model has emerged that combines large centralized clinical laboratories performing most tests on one high-throughput analytical platform connected to several distal laboratories dealing locally with urgent analyses at near point of care. The centralization of diagnostic services over a large geographical region has given rise to the concept of regional-scale “microbiology laboratories network.” Although the volume-driven cost savings associated with such laboratory networks seem self-evident, the consequence(s) for the quality of patient care and infectious disease surveillance and control remain less obvious. In this article, we describe the range of opportunities that the changing landscape of CMLs in Europe can contribute toward improving the quality of patient care but also the early detection and enhanced surveillance of public health threats caused by infectious diseases. The success of this transformation of health services is reliant on the appropriate preparation in terms of staff, skills, and processes that would be inclusive of stakeholders. In addition, rigorous metrics are needed to set out more concrete laboratory service performance objectives and assess the expected benefits to society in terms of saving lives and preventing diseases.","Vandenberg, Olivier; Kozlakidis, Zisis; Schrenzel, Jacques; Struelens, Marc Jean; Breuer, Judith",Front Med (Lausanne),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29457001/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2018.00015,175

Here, we show that endothelial cells do not express angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), the SARS-CoV-2 receptor. Instead, pericytes and microvascular smooth muscle cells express ACE2 in an organotypic manner. Pericyte deficiency leads to increased endothelial expression and release of Von Willebrand factor and intravascular platelet and fibrin aggregation, suggesting that pericytes limit endothelial pro-thrombotic responses. That pericytes and not endothelial cells express ACE2 may provide important clues to the pathology of COVID-19, as pericytes are normally shielded behind an endothelial barrier and may get infected only when this barrier is compromised by COVID-19 risk factors.","He, Liqun; Mäe, Maarja Andaloussi; Muhl, Lars; Sun, Ying; Pietilä, Riikka; Nahar, Khayrun; Liébanas, Elisa Vázquez; Fagerlund, Malin Jonsson; Oldner, Anders; Liu, Jianping; Genové, Guillem; Zhang, Lei; Xie, Yuan; Leptidis, Stefanos; Mocci, Giuseppe; Stritt, Simon; Osman, Ahmed; Anisimov, Andrey; Hemanthakumar, Karthik Amudhala; Räsänen, Markus; Mirabeau, Olivier; Hansson, Emil; Björkegren, Johan; Vanlandewijck, Michael; Blomgren, Klas; Mäkinen, Taija; Peng, Xiao-Rong; Arnold, Thomas D.; Alitalo, Kari; Eriksson, Lars I; Lendahl, Urban; Betsholtz, Christer",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.11.088500,175

From a strategic perspective, firms may proactively undertake philanthropic efforts to limit the spread of the pandemic and avoid a degraded business environment. From the perspective of non-trivial costs, increased economic uncertainty can raise concerns about business survival and lead to conservative philanthropic strategies. Following the proverb “prosperity makes friends, adversity tries them,” at the provincial level, our results support the second perspective. Specifically, when the spread of the pandemic worsens in a province, local firms are less likely to make COVID-19-related donations in terms of likelihood and amount. Investors also react negatively, not only to the local spread of COVID-19 but also to COVID-19-related philanthropic donations. At the organizational level, our evidence indicates that there is at least some level of cost–benefit analysis underlying corporate philanthropic decisions. Specifically, corporate philanthropic donations, especially those made to the local business environment, are significantly affected by organizational-level factors, such as pre-existing resource availability and motives to acquire political and reputational resources. Overall, our multilevel study presents a comprehensive picture of corporate philanthropic decisions amid the COVID-19 crisis.","Chen, Hanwen; Liu, Siyi; Liu, Xin; Yang, Daoguang",J Bus Ethics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33612897/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10551-021-04745-z,175

The new technology has posed challenges both for governments aiming at high and effective uptake and for citizens weighing its benefits (e.g., protecting others’ health) against the potential risks (e.g., loss of data privacy). Our cross-sectional survey with repeated measures across four samples in Germany ([Formula: see text] ) focused on psychological factors contributing to the public adoption of digital contact tracing. We found that public acceptance of privacy-encroaching measures (e.g., granting the government emergency access to people’s medical records or location tracking data) decreased over the course of the pandemic. Intentions to use contact tracing apps—hypothetical ones or the Corona-Warn-App launched in Germany in June 2020—were high. Users and non-users of the Corona-Warn-App differed in their assessment of its risks and benefits, in their knowledge of the underlying technology, and in their reasons to download or not to download the app. Trust in the app’s perceived security and belief in its effectiveness emerged as psychological factors playing a key role in its adoption.

Like other coronaviruses, this novel virus relies on the surface Spike glycoprotein to access the host cells, mainly through the interaction of its Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) with the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Therefore, molecular entities able to interfere with binding of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein to ACE2 have a great potential to inhibit viral entry. Starting from the available structural data on the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and the host ACE2 receptor, we here engineered a mini-protein with the aim of creating a soluble and stable Spike interactor. This mini-protein, which was recombinantly produced in high yields, possesses a stable α helical conformation and is able to interact with the RBD of glycosylated Spike protein from SARS-CoV-2 with nanomolar affinity, as measured by microscale thermophoresis. By plugging the Spike protein, our mini-protein constitutes a valid tool for the development of treatments against different types of coronavirus.","Romano, Maria; Ruggiero, Alessia; Squeglia, Flavia; Berisio, Rita",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.29.067728,175

Diagnostic utility of serum albumin to globulin ratio for the diagnosis of FIP was greater than of the utility of serum total protein and ‐/‐globulin concentrations. Diagnostic utility of these variables was higher when performed on effusion. On effusion, positive and negative predictive values of Rivalta's test, a test that distinguishes between exudates and transudates (0.86 and 0.97), anti‐coronavirus antibody detection (0.90 and 0.79), and immunofluorescence staining of coronavirus antigen in macrophages (1.00 and 0.57) were investigated. The positive and negative predictive values of presence of anti‐coronavirus antibodies were 0.44 and 0.90, respectively, antibody concentrations (1:1,600) were 0.94 and 0.88, presence of immune complexes measured by a competitive enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay were 0.67 and 0.84, and detection of viral RNA by serum reverse‐transcrip‐tase polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) were 0.90 and 0.47. Effusion RT‐PCR was performed in 6 cats; it was positive in all 5 cats with FIP and negative in the cat with another disease. Diagnostic assays on the fluid in cats with body effusion had good predictive values. Definitive diagnosis of FIP on the basis of measurement of various variables in serum was not possible. Serum tests can only be used to facilitate the decision for more invasive diagnostic methods.","Hartmann, Katrin; Binder, Christina; Hirschberger, Johannes; Cole, Dana; Reinacher, Manfred; Schroo, Simone; Frost, Jens; Egberink, Herman; Lutz, Hans; Hermanns, Walter",J Vet Intern Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14658713/,175

In the present analysis we coupled climate data with COVID-19 spread rates worldwide, and in a single country (USA). Methods: Data of confirmed COVID-19 cases was derived from the COVID-19 Global Cases by the CSSE at Johns Hopkins University up to March 19, 2020. We assessed disease spread by two measures: replication rate (RR), the slope of the logarithmic curve of confirmed cases, and the rate of spread (RoS), the slope of the linear regression of the logarithmic curve. Results: Based on predefined criteria, the mean COVID-19 RR was significantly lower in warm climate countries (0.12± 0.02) compared with cold countries (0.24± 0.01), (P<0.0001). Similarly, RoS was significantly lower in warm climate countries 0.12± 0.02 vs. 0.25± 0.01 than in cold climate countries (P<0.001). In all countries (independent of climate classification) both RR and RoS displayed a moderate negative correlation with temperature R= -0.69, 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.87 to -0.36; P<0.001 and R= -0.72, 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.87 to -0.36; P<0.001, respectively. We identified a similar moderate negative correlation with the dew point temperature. Additional climate variables did not display a significant correlation with neither RR nor RoS. Finally, in an ancillary analysis, COVID-19 intra-country model using an inter-state analysis of the USA did not identify yet correlation between climate parameters and RR or RoS as of March, 19, 2020. Conclusions: Our analysis suggests a plausible negative correlation between warmer climate and COVID-19 spread rate as defined by RR and RoS worldwide. This initial correlation should be interpreted cautiously and be further validated over time, the pandemic is at different stages in various countries as well as in regions within these countries.

In Italy, these measures included a nationwide lockdown, with limited exceptions including grocery shopping, certain work activities, and healthcare. Consistently with findings from previous studies investigating the psychological impact of similar pandemics [e.g., Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)], there is evidence that Covid-19 is associated with negative mental health outcomes. Given this background, we conducted a cross-sectional study aimed at investigating the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and the subsequent restrictive measures imposed by the Government on the psychological health of Italian men and women aged = 18 years and living in Lombardy, one of the worst-hit regions. The study also aimed at identifying what factors are associated with specific psychological outcomes. Thus, we developed an online survey that included a researcher-made questionnaire to collect sociodemographic, household, general health, and pandemic-related information. The Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and the Perceived Stress Scale were used to assess anxiety, depression, and perceived stress, respectively. We found that younger age, greater concerns about the pandemic, female gender, being unmarried, not having children, and being a student were associated with worse psychological health. These findings may provide further insight into the risk factors associated with negative psychological outcomes during the current pandemic, with identification of vulnerable groups.

Using data from Eurocontrol, the European network manager, the paper identifies the responses individual airline operators and parent companies took to contract and consolidate their operations. The findings show that changes to flight operations, rationalising the fleet, reducing staff numbers, and reconfiguring their networks and capacity were the most common responses.

The settling times of a droplet cloud and its suspended viral dose are significantly affected by the droplet composition. The aerosol (defined as droplets smaller than 5 μm) resulting from 30 s of continued speech has O(1 h) settling time and a viable viral dose an order-of-magnitude higher than in a short cough. The time-of-flight to reach 2 m is only a few seconds resulting in a viral dose above the minimum required for infection, implying that physical distancing in the absence of ventilation is not sufficient to provide safety for long exposure times. The suspended aerosol emitted by continuous speaking for 1 h in a poorly ventilated room gives 0.1–11% infection risk for initial viral loads of [Formula: see text] , respectively, decreasing to 0.03–3% for 10 air changes per hour by ventilation.

639589,Drivers of airborne human-to-human pathogen transmission,2016-12-02,"OBJECTIVES: Healthcare systems worldwide have been overburdened by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. Accordingly, hospitals had to implement strategies to profoundly reshape both non-COVID-19 medical care and surgical activities. Knowledge about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cardiac surgery practice is pivotal. The goal of the present study was to describe the changes in cardiac surgery practices during the health emergency at the national level. METHODS: A 26-question web-enabled survey including all adult cardiac surgery units in Italy was conducted to assess how their clinical practice changed during the national lockdown. Data were compared to data from the corresponding period in 2019. RESULTS: All but 2 centres (94.9%) adopted specific protocols to screen patients and personnel. A significant reduction in the number of dedicated cardiac intensive care unit beds (−35.4%) and operating rooms (−29.2%), along with healthcare personnel reallocation to COVID departments (nurses −15.4%, anaesthesiologists −7.7%), was noted. Overall adult cardiac surgery volumes were dramatically reduced (1734 procedures vs 3447; P < 0.001), with a significant drop in elective procedures [580 (33.4%) vs 2420 (70.2%)]. CONCLUSIONS: This national survey found major changes in cardiac surgery practice as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This experience should lead to the development of permanent systems-based plans to face possible future pandemics. These data may effectively help policy decision-making in prioritizing healthcare resource reallocation during the ongoing pandemic and once the healthcare emergency is over.","Rubino, Antonino Salvatore; De Santo, Luca Salvatore; Pisano, Antonio; Mauro, Michele di; Benussi, Stefano; Borghetti, Valentino; Castiglioni, Alessandro; Chiariello, Luigi; Colli, Andrea; De Bellis, Antonio; De Filippo, Carlo Maria; De Paulis, Ruggero; Di Benedetto, Giuseppe; Di Eusanio, Marco; Faggian, Giuseppe; Fiorani, Brenno; Fratto, Pasquale Antonio; Giuffrida, Angelo Giuseppe; Glauber, Mattia; Iannelli, Gabriele; Iesu, Severino; Livi, Ugolino; Martinelli, Gianluca; Massetti, Massimo; Mastroroberto, Pasquale; Menicanti, Lorenzo; Minniti, Giuseppe; Miraldi, Fabio; Montesi, Gianfranco; Musumeci, Francesco; Nicolini, Francesco; Napoleone, Carlo Pace; Panisi, Paolo; Pappalardo, Aniello; Patanè, Francesco; Ragni, Temistocle; Rinaldi, Mauro; Tribastone, Salvatore; Triggiani, Michele; Tritto, Francesco Paolo; Zebele, Carlo; Parolari, Alessandro; Gerosa, Gino; De Feo, Marisa",Eur J Cardiothorac Surg,https://doi.org/10.1093/ejcts/ezaa436; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33657222/,175
639650,"Correction for Li et al., “Discovery of Bat Coronaviruses through Surveillance and Probe Capture-Based Next-Generation Sequencing”",2020-03-18,"Since the outbreak of the global COVID-19 pandemic, social distancing has been known to everyone and recommended almost everywhere everyday. Social distancing has been and will be one of the most effective measures and sometimes, the only available one for fighting epidemics and saving lives. However, it has not been so clear how social distancing should be practiced or managed, especially when it comes to regulating everyone’s otherwise normal social activities. The debate on how to implement social distancing often leads to a heated political argument, while research on the subject is lacking. This paper is to provide a theoretical basis for the understanding of the scientific nature of social distancing by considering it as a social dilemma game played by every individual against his/her population. From this perspective, every individual needs to make a decision on how to engage in social distancing, or risk being trapped into a dilemma either exposing to deadly diseases or getting no access to necessary social activities. As the players of the game, the individual’s decisions depend on the population’s actions and vice versa, and an optimal strategy can be found when the game reaches an equilibrium. The paper shows how an optimal strategy can be determined for a population with either closely related or completely separated social activities and with either single or multiple social groups, and how the collective behaviors of social distancing can be simulated by following every individual’s actions as the distancing game progresses. The simulation results for populations of varying sizes and complexities are presented, which not only justify the choices of the strategies based on the theoretical analysis, but also demonstrate the convergence of the individual actions to an optimal distancing strategy in silico and possibly in natura as well, if every individual makes rational distancing decisions.","Wu, Zhijun",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34339481/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0255543,175

This report describes a COVID‐19 patient treated with nafamostat and heparin to prevent circuit thrombosis during ECMO support. CASE PRESENTATION: A 63‐year‐old man was transferred to our hospital with respiratory failure due to COVID‐19 pneumonia. He was provided venous‐venous ECMO to maintain oxygenation. During ECMO support, occlusive circuit thrombosis developed despite systemic anticoagulation therapy with heparin. He was subsequently administered combination therapy with nafamostat and heparin. Although the combination therapy could prevent circuit thrombosis, it was converted to heparin monotherapy because of hyperkalemia and hemothorax. After tracheostomy and a gradual improvement in oxygenation, ECMO was discontinued. He was transferred to another hospital for further rehabilitation. CONCLUSION: Combination therapy with nafamostat and heparin can prevent circuit thrombosis during ECMO. However, bleeding can still develop with this combination therapy during ECMO.","Doi, Shunichi; Akashi, Yoshihiro J; Takita, Mumon; Yoshida, Hideki; Morikawa, Daiki; Ishibashi, Yuki; Higuma, Takumi; Fujitani, Shigeki",Acute Med Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33042560/; https://doi.org/10.1002/ams2.585,175

Here, we report phenotypes associated with a null Ddx1 (Ddx1(AX)) mutation generated in Drosophila melanogaster. Ddx1 null flies are viable but significantly smaller than control and Ddx1 heterozygous flies. Female Ddx1 null flies have reduced fertility with egg chambers undergoing autophagy, whereas males are sterile due to disrupted spermatogenesis. Comparative RNA sequencing of control and Ddx1 null third instars identified several transcripts affected by Ddx1 inactivation. One of these, Sirup mRNA, was previously shown to be overexpressed under starvation conditions and implicated in mitochondrial function. We demonstrate that Sirup is a direct binding target of Ddx1 and that Sirup mRNA is differentially spliced in the presence or absence of Ddx1. Combining Ddx1 null mutation with Sirup dsRNA-mediated knock-down causes epistatic lethality not observed in either single mutant. Our data suggest a role for Drosophila Ddx1 in stress-induced regulation of splicing.","Germain, Devon R.; Li, Lei; Hildebrandt, Matthew R.; Simmonds, Andrew J.; Hughes, Sarah C.; Godbout, Roseline",Dev Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26433063/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ydbio.2015.09.012; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012160615302050; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0012160615302050,175
641398,"Fully integrated microfluidic devices for qualitative, quantitative and digital nucleic acids testing at point of care",2020-12-31,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) is an emerging enteropathogen distributed globally, which causes substantial economic losses in the swine industry. The characterization of the receptor promiscuity may pose a risk of cross-species transmission. However, the options for pharmaceutical interventions are limited. In this study, the vectors expressing shRNAs targeting the nucleocapsid gene were generated to assess the inhibition effect of PDCoV reproduction. Our preliminary results demonstrate that a dual shRNA expression system is an effective strategy in combating PDCoV infection without cytotoxicity, which would facilitate the ongoing development of RNAi-based therapeutic drugs against viral diseases. ABSTRACT: Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) is a novel enteric coronavirus and is becoming one of the major causative agents of diarrhea in pig herds in recent years. To date, there are no commercial vaccines or antiviral pharmaceutical agents available to control PDCoV infection. Therefore, developing a reliable strategy against PDCoV is urgently needed. In this study, to observe the antiviral activity of RNA interference (RNAi), four short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) specific to the nucleocapsid (N) gene of PDCoV were designed and tested in vitro. Of these, a double-shRNA-expression vector, designated as pSil-double-shRNA-N1, was the most effectively expressed, and the inhibition of PDCoV replication was then further evaluated in neonatal piglets. Our preliminary results reveal that plasmid-based double-shRNA-expression targeting the N gene of PDCoV can significantly protect LLC-PK1 cells and piglets from pathological lesions induced by PDCoV. Our study could benefit the investigation of the specific functions of viral genes related to PDCoV infection and offer a possible methodology of RNAi-based therapeutics for PDCoV infection.","Gu, Jun; Li, Hao; Bi, Zhen; Li, Kai; Li, Zhiquan; Song, Deping; Ding, Zhen; He, Houjun; Wu, Qiong; Huang, Dongyan; Gan, Ping; Ye, Yu; Tang, Yuxin",Animals (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33922444/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ani11051216,175

During the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003, the crude fatality rate for older people in care homes that were infected was 72%. After taking the advice of a team of international experts, the Hong Kong Government implemented comprehensive preventive measures to cope with the future epidemics. This commentary evaluates the effectiveness of these measures in coping with both influenza outbreaks and COVID-19 and suggests the lessons learnt are relevant to both developed and less developed countries? Lockdown in care homes is very effective under two conditions. Healthcare workers must wear surgical masks in the care home. Hospitals must adopt a strict policy to prevent virus transmission by discharged patients. Care homes situated within high-rise residential towers are particularly vulnerable to COVID-19 transmission; their residents can more easily be infected by asymptomatic carriers from the community. Airborne virus can also be transmitted more swiftly in care homes with open-plan layouts. Lockdown had been shown to significantly reduce influenza outbreaks in care homes. On the other hand, lockdown causes loneliness to residents. Care homes allow residents to move freely within the care home though with the risk of spreading the virus by resident who is an asymptomatic carrier. Finally, lockdown may cause family members to have guilty feelings. Family members can only make video call or window visit to residents.","Chow, Lina",Age Ageing,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33035300/; https://doi.org/10.1093/ageing/afaa234,175

Chickens were inoculated with IBV field isolate ZQX (genotype GVI-1) and challenged 4 dlater with the E. coli strain MS160427 (serotype O8). Subsequently, these chickens were euthanized at seven days postchallenge (d.p.c.) with E. coli. An autopsy revealed that lesions in the IBV plus E. coli co-infection group were more severe than those in the IBV-infected group. This pathological model was used to assess the protective effect of two commonly used vaccine strains (H120 and 4/91) against the IBV ZQX strain, and a significantly better protective efficacy was observed for 4/91 compared with H120. Thus, IBV and E. coli co-infection could be employed in assessing the protective efficacy of IBV vaccines.","Shen, Yu-Xi; Li, Wen-Wen; Xia, Jing; Du, Ji-Teng; Li, Shu-Yun; Chen, Wen; Cui, Min; Han, Xin-Feng; Huang, Yong",Poult Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34358949/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psj.2021.101324,175

While different types of students showed different levels of resilience, are there significant characteristics among students with similar levels of resilience? In this study, 3,454 students (aged 15–25 years) were surveyed to understand students' perceived social support-coping modes while investigating the demographic characteristics and mental health status of subclasses of different modes. We found that (1) in the two subgroups of students with extremely low and low levels of perceived social support, the source of students' perceived social support did not have a clear orientation; in the two subgroups with moderate and high levels of perceived social support, the most perceived emotional support was from family and friends, while the least perceived support was companionship from teachers, classmates, and relatives, and problems related to the dependability of friends and communication with family. (2) The degree of social support perceived by students is directly proportional to the coping tendency, i.e., as the degree of perceived social support increases, the proportion of students adopting active coping strategies increases while that of students adopting negative coping strategies decreases; thus, we concluded that high levels of emotional support from family and friends can increase students' tendency of adopting positive strategies to cope with difficulties, while problems related to the dependability of friends and communication with family decrease students' tendency of adopting positive coping strategies. (3) Gender had a significant impact on the extremely low and low levels of perceived social support-negative coping tendencies; these subgroups accounted for 34.6% of the total students. Gender showed no significant influence on other subgroups, a school type had no impact on the distribution of the subgroups. (4) The higher the degree of perceived social support, the lower is the degree of students' general anxiety, and the lower is the degree of impact by the COVID-19 pandemic.

In this study, we aimed to present an overview on the most important way to diagnose different kinds of viruses followed by the introduction of nanobiosensors. Afterward, some methods of coronavirus detection such as imaging, laboratory and kit-based diagnostic tests are surveyed. Furthermore, nucleic acids/protein- and-immunoglobulin (Ig)-based nanobiosensors for the COVID-19 detection infection are reviewed. Finally, current challenges and future perspective for the development of diagnostic or monitoring technologies in the control of COVID-19 are discussed to persuade the scientists in advancing their technologies beyond imagination. In conclusion, it can be deduced that as rapid COVID-19 detection infection can play a vital role in disease control and treatment, this review may be of great help for controlling the COVID-19 outbreak by providing some necessary information for the development of portable, accurate, selectable and simple nanobiosensors.","Sharifi, Majid; Hasan, Anwarul; Taghizadeh, Akbar; Haghighat, Setareh; Attar, Farnoosh; Bloukh, Samir Haj; Edis, Zehra; Xue, Mengzhou; Khan, Suliman; Falahati, Mojtaba",Talanta,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33303154/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0039914020309954; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2020.121704; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0039914020309954?v=s5,175

For any two integers [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] , we propose a method to count all non-isomorphic trees with n vertices, [Formula: see text] self-loops, and no multi-edges based on dynamic programming. To achieve this goal, we count the number of non-isomorphic rooted trees with n vertices, [Formula: see text] self-loops and no multi-edges, in [Formula: see text] time and [Formula: see text] space, since every tree can be uniquely viewed as a rooted tree by either regarding its unicentroid as the root, or in the case of bicentroid, by introducing a virtual vertex on the bicentroid and assuming the virtual vertex to be the root. By this result, we get a lower bound and an upper bound on the number of tree-like polymer topologies of chemical compounds with any “cycle rank”.","Azam, Naveed Ahmed; Shurbevski, Aleksandar; Nagamochi, Hiroshi",Entropy (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33286692/; https://doi.org/10.3390/e22090923,175

649883,Molecular Epidemiology of Enterovirus in Children with Central Nervous System Infections,2021-01-13,"BACKGROUND: In the last few years, many countries have introduced laws combating image-based sexual abuse (IBSA), colloquially known as “revenge pornography.” However, the significant growth in the body of literature on the legal perspectives on IBSA, and the media coverage of high profile cases have not been equally met with appreciable victimization studies. Meanwhile, the need for a victim-centered approach in studying IBSA in Nigeria is underscored by the pervasiveness and normalization of sexual violence as a result of societal attitudes about gender and sexuality in the country. Therefore, this study explored the social and psychological implications of IBSA victimization. METHODS: Using qualitative methods, 27 adult women whose sexual images have been non-consensually shared publicly through online channels were purposively selected and interviewed for the study, between September 2019 and April 2020, and a thematic analysis of the participants’ narratives carried out. RESULTS: Victims of IBSA were found to be subjected to higher social condemnation, stigmatization, and isolation based on greater attribution of blames to them by their social network. Evidences of institutional re-victimization were documented. Victims also reported self-blame, paranoia, anger, guilt, depression, suicidal ideation and attempt in dealing with the abuse, secondary victimization, and social isolation. CONCLUSION: IBSA victims are faced with peculiar social and psychological consequences which separate them from victims of other forms of sexual abuse. The study suggests a review of appropriate laws and social policies to prevent IBSA, deploy more victim support services and perpetrator programs, and protect victims from secondary victimization.","Aborisade, Richard Abayomi",Sex Res Social Policy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33520009/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s13178-021-00536-3,175

These recessions are unique, caused initially by supply disruptions, largely due to government-imposed ‘stay-in-shelter lockdowns’. These have interacted with falling incomes and demand, declining exports (and imports), collapsing commodity prices, shrinking travel and tourism, decreasing remittances and foreign exchange shortages. Highlighting implications for employment, wellbeing and development, it argues that governments need to design comprehensive relief measures and recovery policies to address short-term problems. These should prevent cash-flow predicaments from becoming full-blown solvency crises. Instead of returning to the status quo ante, developing countries’ capacities and capabilities need to be enhanced to address long-term sustainable development challenges. Multilateral financial institutions should intermediate with financial sources at low cost to supplement the International Monetary Fund’s Special Drawing Rights to lower borrowing costs for relief and recovery.","Jomo, K.

The three cultural groups examined were secular Jews, Ultra-Orthodox Jews, and Arabs. We compared these cultural groups during the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, just before the Jewish New Year (mid-September 2020) as a second lockdown was announced. Data were gathered from 248 secular Jews, 243 Ultra-Orthodox Jews, and 203 Arabs, who were 18–70 years old (M = 37.14, SD = 12.62). The participants filled out self-reported questionnaires including the Brief Symptom Inventory as a measure of emotional/psychological distress (i.e., somatization, depression, and anxiety) and questionnaires about sense of coherence and different types of hope (i.e., intrapersonal, interpersonal, and transpersonal) as measures of coping resources and resiliency. Differences were found between the three groups in terms of several variables. The Arab participants reported the highest levels of emotional distress and the lowest levels of interpersonal and transpersonal hope; whereas the Ultra-Orthodox participants revealed the highest levels of sense of coherence and other resilience factors. A structural equation model revealed that, in addition to the sociodemographic factors, only sense of coherence and intrapersonal hope played significant roles in explaining emotional distress, explaining 60% of the reported distress among secular Jews, 41% among Ultra-Orthodox Jews, and 48% among Arabs. We discuss our findings in light of the salutogenic and hope theories. We will also discuss their relevancy to meaning-seeking and self-transcendence theory in the three cultural groups.","Braun-Lewensohn, Orna; Abu-Kaf, Sarah; Kalagy, Tehila",Front Psychol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.637349; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33679564/,175

Research is needed to better understand the early COVID-19 anti-vaccine activities on social media. METHODS: This study chronicles the social media posts concerning COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccines by leading anti-vaccine groups (Dr Tenpenny on Vaccines, the National Vaccine Information Center [NVIC] the Vaccination Information Network [VINE]) and Vaccine Machine in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic (February–May 2020). RESULTS: Analysis of 2060 Facebook posts showed that anti-vaccine groups were discussing COVID-19 in the first week of February 2020 and were specifically discussing COVID-19 vaccines by mid-February 2020. COVID-19 posts by NVIC were more widely disseminated and showed greater influence than non-COVID-19 posts. Early COVID-19 posts concerned mistrust of vaccine safety and conspiracy theories. CONCLUSION: Major anti-vaccine groups were sowing seeds of doubt on Facebook weeks before the US government launched its vaccine development program ‘Operation Warp Speed’. Early anti-vaccine misinformation campaigns outpaced public health messaging and hampered the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines.","Kalichman, Seth C; Eaton, Lisa A; Earnshaw, Valerie A; Brousseau, Natalie",J Public Health (Oxf),https://doi.org/10.1093/pubmed/fdab093; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33837428/,175

We aimed to provide potential laboratory basis for auxiliary distinguishing coronavirus disease (COVID‐19) by monitoring above indicators. METHODS: A total of 84 patients with confirmed COVID‐19 were enrolled in the study. Baseline characteristics and laboratory results were collected and analyzed. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to combined detection of SAA and IL‐6 in patients with COVID‐19, and independent risk factors for severity of COVID‐19 were assessed by using binary logistic regression. RESULTS: The main clinical symptoms of patients with COVID‐19 were fever (98.8%), fatigue (61.9%), and dry cough (58.3%). SAA, IL‐6, and NLR were significantly higher in patients with COVID‐19 (all P < .001), and compared with nonsevere patients, three indicators of severe patients were significantly elevated. Besides, combined detection of SAA and IL‐6 better separates healthy people from patients with COVID‐19 than detection of SAA or IL‐6 alone. In addition, elevated SAA, IL‐6, and NLR can be used as independent variables for predicting the severity of patients with COVID‐19. CONCLUSION: Serum amyloid A and IL‐6 could be used as addition parameters to helping the distinguish of patients with COVID‐19 from healthy people, and can provide potential basis for separating patients with nonsevere and severe clinical signs.","Liu, Qian; Dai, Yaping; Feng, Meimei; Wang, Xu; Liang, Wei; Yang, Fumeng",J Clin Lab Anal,https://doi.org/10.1002/jcla.23527; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32860278/,175

The novel human severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been identified as an etiological agent for COVID-19. Several kinases have been proposed as possible mediators of multiple viral infections, including life-threatening coronaviruses like SARS-CoV-1, Middle East syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2. Viral infections hijack abundant cell signaling pathways, resulting in drastic phosphorylation rewiring in the host and viral proteins. Some kinases play a significant role throughout the viral infection cycle (entry, replication, assembly, and egress), and several of them are involved in the virus-induced hyperinflammatory response that leads to cytokine storm, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), organ injury, and death. Here, we highlight kinases that are associated with coronavirus infections and their inhibitors with antiviral and potentially anti-inflammatory, cytokine-suppressive, or antifibrotic activity.","Pillaiyar, Thanigaimalai; Laufer, Stefan",J Med Chem,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.1c00335; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34081439/,175

658034,The first report of Hepatozoon canis infection of a dog in Iran,2009-03-19,"Numerous researches have focused on the genetic variations affecting SARS-CoV-2 infection, whereas the epigenetic effects are inadequately described. In this report, for the first time, we have identified potential candidate genes that might be regulated via SARS-CoV-2 induced DNA methylation changes in COVID-19 infection. At first, in silico transcriptomic data of COVID-19 lung autopsies were used to identify the top differentially expressed genes containing CpG Islands in their promoter region. Similar gene regulations were also observed in an in vitro model of SARS-CoV-2 infected lung epithelial cells (NHBE and A549). SARS-CoV-2 infection significantly decreased the levels of DNA methyltransferases (DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B) in lung epithelial cells. Out of 14 candidate genes identified, the expression of 12 genes was upregulated suggesting promoter hypomethylation, while only two genes were downregulated suggesting promoter hypermethylation in COVID-19. Among those 12 upregulated genes, only HSPA1L and ULBP2 were found to be upregulated in AZA-treated lung epithelial cells and immune cells, suggesting their epigenetic regulation. To confirm the hypomethylation of these two genes during SARS-CoV-2 infection, their promoter methylation and mRNA expression levels were determined in the genomic DNA/RNA obtained from whole blood samples of asymptomatic, severe COVID-19 patients and equally matched healthy controls. The methylation level of HSPA1L was significantly decreased and the mRNA expression was increased in both asymptomatic and severe COVID-19 blood samples suggesting its epigenetic regulation by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Functionally, HSPA1L is known to facilitate host viral replication and has been proposed as a potential target for antiviral prophylaxis and treatment.","Muhammad, Jibran Sualeh; Saheb Sharif-Askari, Narjes; Cui, Zheng-Guo; Hamad, Mawieh; Halwani, Rabih",Front Genet,https://doi.org/10.3389/fgene.2021.622271; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33679887/,175
658509,Are Nonhuman Primates Good Models for SARS?,2006-09-26,"Guillain‐Barre Syndrome (GBS) is an inflammatory polyradiculoneuropathy associated with numerous viral infections. Recently, there have been many case reports describing the association between COVID‐19 and GBS but much remains unknown about the strength of the association and the features of GBS in this setting. We reviewed 37 published cases of GBS associated with COVID‐19 to summarize this information for clinicians and to determine whether a specific clinical or electrodiagnostic (EDX) pattern is emerging. The mean age (59y), gender (65% male) and COVID‐19 features appear to reflect those of hospitalized COVID‐19 patients early in the pandemic. The mean time from COVID‐19 symptoms to GBS symptoms was 11 days. The clinical presentation and severity of these GBS cases was similar to those with non‐COVID‐19 GBS. The EDX pattern was considered demyelinating in approximately one half of the cases. Cerebrospinal fluid, when assessed, demonstrated albuminocytologic dissociation in 76% of patients and was negative for SARS‐CoV‐2 in all. Serum anti‐ganglioside antibodies were absent in 15 of 17 patients tested. Most patients were treated with a single course of intravenous immunoglobulin, and improvement was noted within 8 weeks in most. In summary, GBS associated COVID‐19 appears to be an uncommon condition with similar clinical and EDX patterns to GBS prior to the pandemic. Future studies should compare patients with COVID‐19 associated GBS to those with contemporaneous non‐COVID‐19 GBS and determine if the incidence of GBS is elevated in those with COVID‐19.","Caress, James B.; Castoro, Ryan J.; Simmons, Zachary; Scelsa, Stephen N.; Lewis, Richard A.; Ahlawat, Aditi; Nayaranaswami, Pushpa",Muscle Nerve,https://doi.org/10.1002/mus.27024; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32678460/,175

A 26‐year‐old multigravida at 35 weeks 2 days of gestation, who had extensive thigh and abdominal cellulitis, tested SARS‐CoV‐2 positive by RT‐PCR performed on samples from the endometrium and maternal side of the placenta. However, other samples (amniotic fluid, fetal side of the placenta, umbilical cord, maternal vagina, and neonatal nasopharynx) tested negative for SARS‐CoV‐2. This is one of the rare reports of probable SARS‐CoV‐2 viremia with the presence of SARS‐CoV‐2 in the endometrium and placenta, but not leading to vertical transmission and neonatal infection. Because knowledge about transplacental transmission and results is very limited, we conclude that more RT‐PCR tests on placental and cord blood samples are needed in order to safely make definite conclusions.","Akdemir, Yesim; Haciseyitoglu, Demet; Celebi, Guven; Aydemir, Cumhur; Bahadır, Burak; Cakir, Anil T.; Barut, Aykut; Ozmen, Ulku",J Med Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34260081/; https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.27202,175

This study set out to develop a short, reliable, valid, and gender-invariant instrument—the Pandemic Fatigue Scale (PFS). Methods: In the first phase, 300 students responded to a pilot questionnaire that allowed the reduction and refinement of the items. In the second phase, the validity, reliability, and invariance of the scale were explored among a sample of 596 participants. Results: Factor exploratory and confirmatory analyses confirmed a robust adjustment for the bifactorial structure that explained 79,36% of the variance. The two factors identified were 1) people’s demotivation in continuing to follow the recommended protective behaviors (neglect) and 2) people’s boredom regarding the pandemic-related information (boredom). The pattern of relations between the Pandemic Fatigue Scale and other variables—find through correlation, mediation, and path analyses—and the gender differences—find in the ANOVA analyses—provided strong evidence of the construct validity. Moreover, the PFS was shown to be invariant regarding gender in a multigroup factor confirmatory analysis. Conclusion: The instrument can be of utility for professionals and researchers to assess pandemic fatigue, a variable that can affect the adoption of protective measure to avoid catching and spreading the virus.","Cuadrado, Esther; Maldonado, Miguel A.; Tabernero, Carmen; Arenas, Alicia; Castillo-Mayén, Rosario; Luque, Bárbara",Int J Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34566554/; https://doi.org/10.3389/ijph.2021.1604260,175

It has mainly been studied in terms of its interaction with cellular proteins. Here, we show that HBx induces membrane permeabilization independently of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore complex. We generated mitochondrial outer membrane‐mimic liposomes to observe the direct effects of HBx on membranes. We found that HBx induced membrane permeabilization, and the region comprising the transmembrane domain and the mitochondrial‐targeting sequence was sufficient for this process. Membrane permeabilization was inhibited by nonselective channel blockers or by N‐(n‐nonyl)deoxynojirimycin (NN‐DNJ), a viroporin inhibitor. Moreover, NN‐DNJ inhibited HBx‐induced mitochondrial depolarization in Huh‐7 cells. Based on the results of this study, we can postulate that the HBx protein itself is sufficient to induce mitochondrial membrane permeabilization. Our finding provides important information for a strategy of HBx targeting during HBV treatment.","Lee, H‐R.; Cho, Y. Y.; Lee, G. Y.; You, D‐g.; Yoo, Y. D.; Kim, Y.

The present systematic review and meta-analysis aim to assess hematological changes seen in COVID-19 infection and their association with the severity of the disease. Methods Pooled proportions were calculated using both fixed effects model and random effects model. Weighted mean difference and 95% CI were calculated and reported. Results Initial search identified 84 reference articles, 23 relevant articles were selected and reviewed. Compared to general population, the weighted mean difference of WBC count in all COVID-19 patients was lower by 0.97 × 10(9 )mm(3 )(95% CI = –1.29 to –0.66). In severe COVID-19 patients, the weighted mean difference of platelet count was lower by 23.85 × 10(9)/liter (95% CI = –35.18 to –9.53), as compared to general population. The weighted mean difference of prothrombin time, D-Dimer, and fibrinogen in severe COVID-19 patients was higher by 1.92 seconds (95% CI = 0.01 to 3.84), 6.23 mg/liter (95% CI = 0.11 to 12.36) and 1.88 g/liter (95% CI = 1.18 to 2.48) respectively, as compared to general population. Pooled proportion showed D-Dimer to be elevated in 80.00% (95 % CI = 50.00 to 99.00) of severe patients. Conclusions Our meta-analysis shows that patients with COVID-19 have significant thrombocytopenia, leukopenia along with elevated D-dimer, fibrinogen and prothrombin time.

The medical response both commercial and clinical achieved what it could with the resources it had. In addition, society changed old habits and developed new behavior patterns. It is appropriate to identify what lessons were learned from COVID-19 for the future. The most important observation for managing SARS-CoV-2 infections was the identification, but not necessarily appreciation, of the manner in which the virus acts over time in the host that it infects. Based on population densities, the ease with which people are mobile and the way that SARS-CoV-2 infected humans, other infectious diseases can easily become pandemics in the future. This review is not focused on a xenobiotic and its toxicant properties. Rather, the review describes the relationship between a therapeutic (hydroxychloroquine) and the progression of a disease (SARS-CoV-2) along with the timing and sequence of the various pathologies that the disease causes. While at first glance, this may appear to beyond the scope of toxicology, it is not. Toxicology is capable to address disease-induced pathologies because it can use the same skills and tools that it uses for pathologies that xenobiotics cause. Assessing the pathology caused by a disease concurrently with the pathology caused by the drug used to treat the disease, puts toxicology in a position to make a greater contribution to drug development. Repurposing toxicology, just as drugs were repurposed for the COVID-19 pandemic, will avoid missing or misusing a useful therapeutic agent just because the disease-initiated pathology was ignored or unappreciated.","Budny, John A",Toxicol Res (Camb),https://doi.org/10.1093/toxres/tfab015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34183901/,175

Recent British elections have seen a shift from economic left–right competition between the major parties to competition on the cultural (liberal–authoritarian) dimension, most notably in terms of the issues of immigration and membership of the European Union. Using British Election Study data from June 2020, we find that coronavirus attitudes fall primarily onto the traditional economic left–right dimension, with left-wing voters more willing to make economic sacrifices of various types to reduce infections. However, more draconian coronavirus measures (such as fining or imprisoning those who violate the coronavirus rules) are most supported by voters who score high on authoritarianism. We show that the structure of coronavirus attitudes puts the Conservative government in a difficult position where many steps it takes to reduce infections risk alienating its core economic right-wing vote.","Mellon, Jonathan; Bailey, Jack; Prosser, Christopher",Parliam Aff,https://doi.org/10.1093/pa/gsab030,175

This research aimed to compare the performance of 2 antinucleocapsid assays. METHODS: Serum from 49 HCWs was analysed at baseline and 6 months using the Abbott diagnostics SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay and the Roche Diagnostics Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 total antibody assay. RESULTS: At baseline, 14/49 participants (29%) demonstrated antibody reactivity using the Abbott assay. At 6 months, 4/14 participants (29%) continued to demonstrate reactivity. A total of 14/49 (29%) participants had detectable antibodies at baseline using the Roche assay. In total, 13/14 (93%) of participants demonstrated antibody reactivity at 6 months. The Abbott assay showed a statistically significant difference in the signal-to-threshold values of baseline reactive samples when repeated at 6 months (p = 0.001). This was not seen with the Roche assay (p = 0.51). CONCLUSION: In this small study, the Roche Diagnostics Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 total antibody assay appears superior in performance to the Abbott diagnostics SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay in accurately detecting participants with a history of confirmed COVID-19 disease at 6 months follow-up.

Here we report on a beneficial impact of a passive immunotherapy with convalescent plasma to treat a prolonged, active COVID-19 infection in a patient with a history of nasopharyngeal diffuse large B-cell lymphoma treated with the therapy inducing substantial impairment of particularly humoral arm of immune system. The specific aim was to quantify SARS-CoV2 neutralizing antibodies in a patient plasma during the course of therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Besides the standard of care treatment and monitoring, neutralizing antibody titers in patient's serum samples, calibrated according to the First WHO International Standard for anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin (human), were quantified in a time-dependent manner. During the immunotherapy period peripheral blood flow cytometry immunophenotyping was conducted to characterize lymphocyte subpopulations. RESULTS: The waves of clinical improvements and worsening coincided with transfused neutralizing antibodies rises and drops in the patient's systemic circulation, proving their contribution in controlling the disease progress. Besides the patient's lack of own humoral immune system, immunophenotyping analysis revealed also the reduced level of helper T-lymphocytes and immune exhaustion of monocytes. CONCLUSION: Therapeutic approach based on convalescent plasma transfusion transformed a prolonged, active COVID-19 infection into a manageable chronic disease.","Rnjak, D.; Ravlić, S.; Šola, A.-M.; Halassy, B.; Šemnički, J.; Šuperba, M.; Hećimović, A.; Kurolt, I.-C.; Kurtović, T.; Mačak Šafranko, Ž.; Polančec, D.; Bendelja, K.; Mušlin, T.; Jukić, I.; Vuk, T.; Zenić, L.; Artuković, M.",Transfus Clin Biol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1246782021000653?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tracli.2021.04.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33901641/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1246782021000653,175

Although some risk factors for SB in SSD are well understood, the extent to which personality traits may affect this risk remains unclear, which may have implications for prevention. We conducted a systematic review of previous studies indexed in MEDLINE, PsycINFO and Embase examining the relationship between personality traits and SB in samples of patients with SSD. Seven studies fulfilled predetermined selection criteria. Harm avoidance, passive-dependent, schizoid and schizotypal personality traits increased the risk of SB, while self-directedness, cooperativeness, excluding persistence and self-transcendence acted as protective factors. Although only seven studies were retrieved from three major databases after applying predetermined selection criteria, we found some evidence to support that personality issues may contribute to SB in patients with SSD. Personality traits may therefore become part of routine suicide risk assessment and interventions targeting these personality-related factors may contribute to prevention of SB in SSD.","Canal-Rivero, Manuel; Ayesa-Arriola, Rosa; Setién-Suero, Esther; Crespo-Facorro, Benedicto; Arango, Celso; Dutta, Rina; Lopez-Morinigo, Javier-David",J Clin Med,https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10194604; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34640622/,175

Based on the social compensation hypothesis, however, factors related to social fears could lead to problematic social networking site (SNS) use because individuals try to compensate for their offline popularity. It was shown that individuals with higher levels of social fears tend to prefer computer-mediated (CMC) instead of face to face (FTF) communication. Here, we aimed to create a model that shows the direct and indirect effects of social anxiety and self-esteem on problematic SNS use. A total of 215 participants filled out our survey including measures of social anxiety, self-esteem, fear of negative evaluation, social media and Internet addiction. Using structural equation modeling we tested the indirect and direct effects between the variables. Our results indicated that social anxiety and lower self-esteem could lead to favoring CMC over FTF communication, which may result in problematic internet (PIU) and SNS use as a compensatory behavior to cope with fear of negative evaluation. The indirect pathways might highlight relevant differences behind the motivation of PIU – anonymity – and problematic SNS use – control.

Reverse zoonotic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from humans to other species has been documented in pet cats and dogs, big cats and gorillas in zoos, and farmed mink. As SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to known bat viruses, assessment of the potential risk of transmission of the virus from humans to bats, and its subsequent impacts on conservation and public health, is warranted. A qualitative risk assessment was conducted by a multi-disciplinary group to assess this risk in bats in the Australian context, with the aim of informing risk management strategies for human activities involving interactions with bats. The overall risk of SARS-CoV-2 establishing in an Australian bat population was assessed to be Low, however with a High level of uncertainty. The outcome of the assessment indicates that, for the Australian situation where the prevalence of COVID-19 in humans is very low, it is reasonable for research and rehabilitation of bats to continue, provided additional biosecurity measures are applied. Risk assessment is challenging for an emerging disease where information is lacking and the situation is changing rapidly; assessments should be revised if human prevalence or other important factors change significantly. The framework developed here, based on established animal disease risk assessment approaches adapted to assess reverse zoonotic transmission, has potential application to a range of wildlife species and situations.","Cox-Witton, Keren; Baker, Michelle L.; Edson, Dan; Peel, Alison J.; Welbergen, Justin A.; Field, Hume",One Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33969168/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.onehlt.2021.100247; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2352771421000379; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352771421000379,175

Epidemiological and clinical features of patients with COVID-19 have been examined but Socio-economic aspects of the issue have been less studied. Thus this study aimed to identify the role of human development index (HDI) in the incidence and mortality rates of COVID-19 worldwide. Methods Information of the incidence and mortality rates of COVID-19 was obtained from the Worldometer and data about the HDI 2019 were obtained from the World Bank database. The correlation between incidence, mortality rates, and the HDI parameters were assessed using linear regression. We calculated concentration index (CI) to measure socioeconomic inequality in COVID-19 related mortality & incidence. Results linear regression analysis showed a direct significant correlation between the incidence and mortality rate from COVID-19 and HDI at the global level. The concentration index was positive for incidence rate (0.62) and mortality rate (0.69) of COVID-19, indicating the higher concentration of the rates among groups with high HDI. Conclusions The high incidence and mortality rates of COVID-19 in countries with high and very high HDI are remarkable which should be the top priority of interventions for global health policymakers.

While the structural differences of the preterm heart are now well-described, metabolic insights into the physiologic mechanisms underpinning this risk are needed. Here, we used dynamic fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (PET-MRI) in young adults born term and preterm during normoxic (N = 28 preterm; 18 term) and hypoxic exposure (12% O(2); N = 26 preterm; 17 term) to measure the myocardial metabolic rate of glucose (MMRglc) in young adults born term (N = 18) and preterm (N = 32), hypothesizing that young adults born preterm would have higher rates of MMRglc under normoxic conditions and a reduced ability to augment glucose metabolism under hypoxic conditions. MMRglc was calculated from the myocardial and blood pool time-activity curves by fitting the measured activities to the 3-compartment model of FDG kinetics. MMRglc was similar at rest between term and preterm subjects, and decreased during hypoxia exposure in both groups (p = 0.02 for MMRglc hypoxia effect). There were no differences observed between groups in the metabolic response to hypoxia, either globally (serum glucose and lactate measures) or within the myocardium. Thus, we did not find evidence of altered myocardial metabolism in the otherwise healthy preterm-born adult. However, whether subtle changes in myocardial metabolism may preceed or predict heart failure in this population remains to be determined.","Corrado, Philip A.; Barton, Gregory P.; Razalan-Krause, Francheska C.; François, Christopher J.; Chesler, Naomi C.; Wieben, Oliver; Eldridge, Marlowe; McMillan, Alan B.; Goss, Kara N.",J Clin Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33809883/; https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10061301,175

Acute respiratory syndrome seems to be the most common manifestation of COVID-19. Besides pneumonia, it has been demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 infection affects multiple organs, including brain tissues, causing different neurological manifestations, especially acute cerebrovascular disease (ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke), impaired consciousness and skeletal muscle injury. To our knowledge, among neurological disorders associated with SARS-CoV2 infection, no Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) has been described yet. Herein, we report a case of a 64-year old woman with COVID19 infection who developed a PRES, and we suggest that it could be explained by the disruption of the blood brain barrier induced by the cerebrovascular endothelial dysfunction caused by SARS-CoV-2.","Princiotta Cariddi, Lucia; Tabaee Damavandi, Payam; Carimati, Federico; Banfi, Paola; Clemenzi, Alessandro; Marelli, Margherita; Giorgianni, Andrea; Vinacci, Gabriele; Mauri, Marco; Versino, Maurizio",J Neurol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32583053/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00415-020-10001-7,175
666885,"Moving Beyond Too Little, Too Late: Managing Emerging Infectious Diseases in Wild Populations Requires International Policy and Partnerships",2014-10-07,"The ability of accurate predictions of biological response (biological activity/property/toxicity) of a given chemical makes the quantitative structure‐activity/property/toxicity relationship (QSAR/QSPR/QSTR) models unique among the in silico tools. In addition, experimental data of selected species can also be used as an independent variable along with other structural as well as physicochemical variables to predict the response for different species formulating quantitative activity–activity relationship (QAAR)/quantitative structure–activity–activity relationship (QSAAR) approach. Irrespective of the models' type, the developed model's quality, and reliability need to be checked through multiple classical stringent validation metrics. Among the validation metrics, error-based metrics are more significant as the basic idea of a good predictive model is to improve the predictions' quality by lowering the predicted residuals for new query compounds. Following the concept, we have checked the predictive quality of the QSAR and QSAAR models employing kernel-weighted local polynomial regression (KwLPR) approach over the traditional linear and non-linear regression-based approaches tools such as multiple linear regression (MLR) and k nearest neighbors (kNN). Five datasets which were previously modeled using linear and non-linear regression method were considered to implement the KwPLR approach, followed by comparison of their validation metrics outcomes. For all five cases, the KwLPR based models reported better results over the traditional approaches. The present study's focus is not to develop a better or improved QSAR/QSAAR model over the previous ones, but to demonstrate the advantage, prediction power, and reliability of the KwLPR algorithm and establishing it as a novel, powerful cheminformatic tool. To facilitate the use of the KwLPR algorithm for QSAR/QSPR/QSTR/QSAAR modeling, the authors provide an in-house developed KwLPR.RMD script under the open-source R programming language.

This small (12 kDa) protein is encoded by ORF1a, binds to RNA and seems to be essential for viral RNA synthesis. The crystal structures of the SARS-CoV-2 protein and other homologues suggest that the protein is dimeric as also confirmed by analytical ultracentrifugation and dynamic light scattering. Our data constitute the prerequisite for further NMR-based characterization, and provide the starting point for the identification of small molecule lead compounds that could interfere with RNA binding and prevent viral replication.","F.

To study whether ADE is involved in COVID-19 infections, in vitro pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 entry into Raji cells, K562 cells, and primary B cells mediated by plasma from recovered COVID-19 patients were employed as models. The enhancement of SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells was more commonly detected in plasma from severely-affected elderly patients with high titers of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-specific antibodies. Cellular entry was mediated via the engagement of Fc{gamma}RII receptor through virus-cell membrane fusion, but not by endocytosis. Peptide array scanning analyses showed that antibodies which promote SARS-CoV-2 infection targeted the variable regions of the RBD domain. To further characterize the association between the spike-specific antibody and ADE, an RBD-specific monoclonal antibody (7F3) was isolated from a recovered patient, which potently inhibited SARS-Cov-2 infection of ACE-2 expressing cells and also mediated ADE in Raji cells. Site-directed mutagenesis the spike RBD domain reduced the neutralization activity of 7F3, but did not abolish its binding to the RBD domain. Structural analysis using cryo-electron microscopy (Cryo-EM) revealed that 7F3 binds to spike proteins at a shift-angled pattern with one up and two down RBDs, resulting in partial overlapping with the receptor binding motif (RBM), while a neutralizing monoclonal antibody that lacked ADE activity binds to spike proteins with three up RBDs, resulting in complete overlapping with RBM. Our results revealed that ADE mediated by SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific antibodies could result from binding to the receptor in slightly different pattern from antibodies mediating neutralizations. Studies on ADE using antibodies from recovered patients via cell biology and structural biology technology could be of use for developing novel therapeutic and preventive measures for control of COVID-19 infection.","Wu, F.; Yan, R.; Liu, M.; Liu, Z.; Wang, Y.; Luan, D.; Wu, K.; Song, Z.; Sun, T.; Ma, Y.; Zhang, Y.; Wang, Q.; Li, X.; Ji, P.; Li, Y.; Li, C.; Wu, Y.; Ying, T.; Wen, Y.; Jiang, S.; Zhu, T.; Lu, L.; Zhou, Q.; Huang, J.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.08.20209114; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.08.20209114v1?rss=1,175

The crystal structure of the fusion protein core of Mumps virus (MuV) was determined at 2.2 Å resolution. The complex is a six-helix bundle in which three HR1 peptides form a central highly hydrophobic coiled-coil and three HR2 peptides pack against the hydrophobic grooves on the surface of central coiled-coil in an oblique antiparallel manner. Fusion core of MuV, like those of simian virus 5 and human respiratory syncytium virus, forms typical 3-4-4-4-3 spacing.

We used Mendelian randomization using genetic determinants of serum-ACE levels to test whether decreased ACE levels increase susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection or Covid-19 severity, while reducing potential bias from confounding and reverse causation in observational studies. METHODS: Genetic variants strongly associated with ACE levels, which were nearby the ACE gene, were identified from the ORIGIN trial and a separate genome-wide association study (GWAS) of ACE levels from the AGES cohort. The ORIGIN trial included 4147 individuals of European and Latino ancestries. Sensitivity analyses were performed using a study of 3200 Icelanders. Cohorts from the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative GWAS of up to 960 186 individuals of European ancestry were used for Covid-19 susceptibility, hospitalization and severe-disease outcome. RESULTS: Genetic variants were identified that explain between 18% and 37% of variance in ACE levels. Using genetic variants from the ORIGIN trial, a standard-deviation decrease in ACE levels was not associated with an increase in Covid-19 susceptibility [odds ratio (OR): 1.02, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.90, 1.15], hospitalization (OR: 0.86, 95% CI: 0.68, 1.08) or severe disease (OR: 0.74, 95% CI: 0.51, 1.06). Using genetic variants from the AGES cohort, the result was similar for susceptibility (OR: 0.98, 95% CI: 0.89, 1.09), hospitalization (OR: 0.86, 95% CI: 0.66, 1.11) and severity (OR: 0.75, 95% CI: 0.50, 1.14). Multiple-sensitivity analyses led to similar results. CONCLUSION: Genetically decreased serum ACE levels were not associated with susceptibility to, or severity of, Covid-19 disease. These data suggest that individuals taking ACE inhibitors should not discontinue therapy during the Covid-19 pandemic.","Butler-Laporte, Guillaume; Nakanishi, Tomoko; Mooser, Vincent; Renieri, Alessandra; Amitrano, Sara; Zhou, Sirui; Chen, Yiheng; Forgetta, Vincenzo; Richards, J Brent",Int J Epidemiol,https://doi.org/10.1093/ije/dyaa229; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33349849/,175

Today, its use in medicine includes tissue and organ engineering, creation of prosthetics, the manufacturing of anatomical models for preoperative planning, education with high-fidelity simulations, and the production of surgical guides. Traditionally, these 3-D prints have been manufactured by commercial vendors. However, there are various limitations in the adaptability of these vendors to program-specific needs. Therefore, the implementation of a point-of-care in-house 3-D modeling and printing workflow that allows for customization of 3-D model production is desired.

It is thus of utmost importance to map the dissemination of information by mainstream media outlets and the public response to this information. However, our understanding of this exposure-response dynamic during the COVID-19 pandemic is still limited. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study is to characterize the media coverage and collective internet response to the COVID-19 pandemic in four countries: Italy, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Canada. METHODS: We collected a heterogeneous data set including 227,768 web-based news articles and 13,448 YouTube videos published by mainstream media outlets, 107,898 user posts and 3,829,309 comments on the social media platform Reddit, and 278,456,892 views of COVID-19–related Wikipedia pages. To analyze the relationship between media coverage, epidemic progression, and users’ collective web-based response, we considered a linear regression model that predicts the public response for each country given the amount of news exposure. We also applied topic modelling to the data set using nonnegative matrix factorization. RESULTS: Our results show that public attention, quantified as user activity on Reddit and active searches on Wikipedia pages, is mainly driven by media coverage; meanwhile, this activity declines rapidly while news exposure and COVID-19 incidence remain high. Furthermore, using an unsupervised, dynamic topic modeling approach, we show that while the levels of attention dedicated to different topics by media outlets and internet users are in good accordance, interesting deviations emerge in their temporal patterns. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our findings offer an additional key to interpret public perception and response to the current global health emergency and raise questions about the effects of attention saturation on people’s collective awareness and risk perception and thus on their tendencies toward behavioral change.","Gozzi, Nicolò; Tizzani, Michele; Starnini, Michele; Ciulla, Fabio; Paolotti, Daniela; Panisson, André; Perra, Nicola",J Med Internet Res,https://doi.org/10.2196/21597; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32960775/,175

AIM: To assess potential reuse via autoclaving of NRMs worn daily in a major urban Canadian hospital. METHODS: NRM reusability was assessed following collection from volunteer staff after 2–8 h use, sterilization by autoclaving and PortaCount fit testing. A workflow was developed for reprocessing hundreds of NRMs daily. FINDINGS: Used NRMs passed fit testing after autoclaving once, with 86% passing a second reuse/autoclave cycle. A separate cohort of used masks pre-warmed before autoclaving passed fit testing. To recycle 200–1000 NRMs daily, procedures for collection, sterilization and re-distribution were developed to minimize particle aerosolization risk during NRM handling, to reject NRM showing obvious wear, and to promote adoption by staff. NRM recovery ranged from 49% to 80% across 12 collection cycles. CONCLUSION: Reuse of NRMs is feasible in major hospitals and other healthcare facilities. In sharp contrast to studies of unused NRMs passing fit testing after 10 autoclave cycles, we show that daily wear substantially reduces NRM fit, limiting reuse to a single cycle, but still increasing NRM stocks by ∼66%. Such reuse requires development of a comprehensive plan that includes communication across staffing levels, from front-line workers to hospital administration, to increase the collection, acceptance of and adherence to sterilization processes for NRM recovery.","Czubryt, M.P.; Stecy, T.; Popke, E.; Aitken, R.; Jabusch, K.; Pound, R.; Lawes, P.; Ramjiawan, B.; Pierce, G.N.",J Hosp Infect,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195670120303662; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0195670120303662; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhin.2020.07.035; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32745590/,175

DESIGN: Qualitative interview study, codesigned with mental health service users and carers. METHODS: We conducted semistructured, telephone or online interviews with a purposively constructed sample; a lived experience researcher conducted and analysed interviews with service users. Analysis was based on the constant comparison method. SETTING: National Health Service (NHS) secondary mental health services in England between June and August 2020. PARTICIPANTS: Of 65 participants, 20 had either accessed or needed to access English secondary mental healthcare during the pandemic; 10 were carers of people with mental health difficulties; 35 were members of staff working in NHS secondary mental health services during the pandemic. RESULTS: Experiences of remote care were mixed. Some service users valued the convenience of remote methods in the context of maintaining contact with familiar clinicians. Most participants commented that a lack of non-verbal cues and the loss of a therapeutic ‘safe space’ challenged therapeutic relationship building, assessments and identification of deteriorating mental well-being. Some carers felt excluded from remote meetings and concerned that assessments were incomplete without their input. Like service users, remote methods posed challenges for clinicians who reported uncertainty about technical options and a lack of training. All groups expressed concern about intersectionality exacerbating inequalities and the exclusion of some service user groups if alternatives to remote care are lost. CONCLUSIONS: Though remote mental healthcare is likely to become increasingly widespread in secondary mental health services, our findings highlight the continued importance of a tailored, personal approach to decision making in this area. Further research should focus on which types of consultations best suit face-to-face interaction, and for whom and why, and which can be provided remotely and by which medium.","Liberati, Elisa; Richards, Natalie; Parker, Jennie; Willars, Janet; Scott, David; Boydell, Nicola; Pinfold, Vanessa; Martin, Graham; Dixon-Woods, Mary; Jones, Peter",BMJ Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33888531/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-049210,175

The current SARS-CoV-2 (Coronaviridae) responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic underscores the lack of effective medications currently available to treat these classes of viral pathogens. Similarly, the Flaviviridae, which includes such viruses as Dengue, West Nile, and Zika, and the Filoviridae, with the Ebola-type viruses, as examples, all lack effective therapeutics. In this review, we present fundamental information concerning the biology of these three virus families, including their genomic makeup, mode of infection of human cells, and key proteins that may offer targeted therapies. Further, we present the natural products and their derivatives that have documented activities to these viral and host proteins, offering hope for future mechanism-based antiviral therapeutics. By arranging these potential protein targets and their natural product inhibitors by target type across these three families of virus, new insights are developed, and crossover treatment strategies are suggested. Hence, natural products, as is the case for other therapeutic areas, continue to be a promising source of structurally diverse new anti-RNA virus therapeutics.","Christy, Mitchell P.; Uekusa, Yoshinori; Gerwick, Lena; Gerwick, William H.",J Nat Prod,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jnatprod.0c00968; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33352046/,175

Adipose tissue is one of the most important MSCs sources in the body, and adipose derived stromal cells (ADSCs) from adipose tissue are also one of the most valuable components of stromal vascular fraction (SVF). Finally, Gentile and Sterodimas, have also published their article for the potential use of SVF in COVID-19 treatment in Aging and Disease journal. Their publication has been a guide in many ways. Adipose tissue-derived stromal cells have three main features: Immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory and regenerative. Immunomodulator effects are used as a preventive in patients prone to disease; its anti-inflammatory effects may allow them to be used as a therapeutic during active disease period and finally regenerative effects to repair post-disease sequale. Those cells can be obtained not only enzymatically, but also mechanically with very benefits.

The characterization of the human antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 infection is vital for serosurveillance purposes as well for treatment options such as transfusion with convalescent plasma or immunoglobin products derived from convalescent plasma. In this study, we measured antibody responses in 844 longitudinal samples from 151 RT-PCR positive SARS-CoV-2 convalescent adults during the first 34 weeks after onset of symptoms. All donors were seropositive at the first sampling moment and only one donor seroreverted during follow-up analysis. Anti-RBD IgG and anti-nucleocapsid IgG levels slowly declined with median half-lifes of 62 and 59 days during 2-5 months after symptom onset, respectively. The rate of decline of antibody levels diminished during extended follow-up. In addition, the magnitude of the IgG response correlated with neutralization capacity measured in a classic plaque reduction assay as well in our in-house developed competition assay. The result of this study gives valuable insight into the longitudinal response of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2.","Steenhuis, M.; van Mierlo, G.; Derksen, N. I.

The S protein uses the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE2) for entry into the host cell and binding to ACE2 occurs at the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S protein. Therefore, the protein‐protein interactions (PPIs) between the SARS‐CoV‐2 RBD and human ACE2, could be attractive therapeutic targets for drug discovery approaches designed to inhibit the entry of SARS‐CoV‐2 into the host cells. Herein, with the support of machine learning approaches, we report structure‐based virtual screening as an effective strategy to discover PPIs inhibitors from ZINC database. The proposed computational protocol led to the identification of a promising scaffold which was selected for subsequent binding mode analysis and that can represent a useful starting point for the development of new treatments of the SARS‐CoV‐2 infection.","Pirolli, Davide; Righino, Benedetta; De Rosa, Maria Cristina",Mol Inform,https://doi.org/10.1002/minf.202060080; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33904240/,175

Teleosts, rare holosteans and chondrichthyans are well known from the so-called ‘Goulmima ichthyological assemblage’, however pycnodonts (Actinopterygii, Pycnodontiformes) have received scant attention and remain undescribed until now. Five nominal species are recognised in the assemblage, including two new forms: Neomesturus asflaensis gen. et sp. nov. and Paranursallia cavini sp. nov. The Italian genus Polazzodus is reported in Morocco for the first time. Specimen taphonomy is examined in the context of substrate consistency and oxygenation of an outer shelf carbonate platform setting. Diversity and ecological disparity of the Goulmima assemblage is revised in regard to trophic partitioning with durophagy seemingly more diverse than previously recognised.

Among various BHK-21 cell clones, the fibroblast-like BHK-21/C-13 line and the epithelial-like BHK-21/WI-2 line are commonly used cell clones for alphavirus research. Here we report that BHK-21/WI-2 cells were significantly less susceptible to primary infection by the alphavirus chikungunya virus (CHIKV) than were BHK-21/C-13 cells. The electroporation efficiency of alphavirus RNA into BHK-21/WI-2 was also lower than that of BHK-21/C-13. The growth of CHIKV was decreased in BHK-21/WI-2 compared to BHK-21/C-13, while primary infection and growth of the alphavirus Sindbis virus (SINV) were equivalent in the two cell lines. Our results suggested that CHIKV entry could be compromised in BHK-21/WI-2. Indeed, we found that the mRNA level of the CHIKV receptor MXRA8 in BHK-21/WI-2 cells was much lower than that in BHK-21/C-13 cells, and exogenous expression of either human MXRA8 or hamster MXRA8 rescued CHIKV infection. Our results affirm the importance of the MXRA8 receptor for CHIKV infection, and document differences in its expression in two clonal cell lines derived from the original BHK-21 cell cultures. Our results also indicate that CHIKV propagation and entry studies in BHK-21 cells will be significantly more efficient in BHK-21/C-13 than in BHK-21/WI-2 cells.","Yin, Peiqi; Kielian, Margaret",Viruses,https://doi.org/10.3390/v13060949; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34063936/,175

An interesting and relatively unexplored research topic concerns the associations between economic stress and employee job outcomes such as innovative behaviors, indispensable for business survival. The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship between economic stress, absenteeism and innovation. We considered both a direct and a mediation hypothesis and hypothesized that economic stress can have a negative influence on innovation directly and indirectly through increased absenteeism. A cross-sectional study was performed during 2018 and 2019 in an Italian food factory. A sample of 578 employees completed the Stress Questionnaire, the Janssen’s nine-item scale and a single-item regarding absenteeism. All relationships are supported by empirical data. As expected, the results indicated that economic stress is negatively related to innovation and positively related to absenteeism, which, in turn, plays a mediating role in the relationship between economic stress and innovative behavior. Herewith, those employees with higher levels of economic stress show higher levels of absenteeism contributing at the same time to a decrease in innovative behaviors. These findings show the importance of economic stress in understanding individual work outcomes and highlight the need to promote adequate intervention programs.","Sanchez-Gomez, Martin; Giorgi, Gabriele; Finstad, Georgia Libera; Alessio, Federico; Ariza-Montes, Antonio; Arcangeli, Giulio; Mucci, Nicola",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18105265; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34063404/,175
672669,A direct isothermal amplification system adapted for rapid SNP genotyping of multifarious sample types,2018-09-15,"COVID-19 greatly affected Europe between March and May 2020. Initial reports suggest cancer and haematological malignancies as risk factors for severity and mortality, but the role of allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT) remains unclear. The Société Francophone de Greffe de Moelle et Thérapie Cellulaire conducted a multicentre retrospective study of alloHSCT recipients diagnosed with COVID-19. We described the COVID-19 disease characteristics in this population and examined risk factors for severity and mortality. Data were collected retrospectively from the patients’ charts and the ProMISe database. Diagnosis was retained only if a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay test from a nose swab was positive for SARS-CoV-2. Patients were classified as severe if they were transferred to an intensive care unit (ICU) due to COVID-19 or died of COVID-19, and non-severe in other cases. Comparisons of characteristics were performed using student’s t-tests and Mann-Whitney U tests for normally and abnormally distributed data, respectively, for continuous variables and χ2 or Fisher’s exact tests, when appropriate for categorical variables. Risk factors associated with a severe form of COVID-19 were assessed using both univariate and multivariate logistic regressions. All analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4.6 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA. A two-tailed significance level p<0.05 was used. Fifty-four patients were diagnosed, including 21 with severe forms (intensive care transfer and/or death). Haematological characteristics did not vary between patients with severe or non-severe forms of COVID-19. Patients with a severe form of COVID-19 were more likely to be diagnosed earlier after alloHSCT (0.78 vs. 2.1 years, p=0.01), to have comorbidities (80.9% vs. 54.5%, p=0.05) and to receive immunosuppressive treatment (81% vs. 51.5%, p=0.03). Severe COVID-19 patients were more likely to have symptoms at COVID-19 diagnosis (100% vs. 81.8%, p=0.04), especially pneumonia and symptoms other than respiratory or digestive (asthenia, neurological symptoms, myalgia, dysgeusia, skin lesions and arthralgia), and to experience co-infection during the course of the disease (52.4% vs. 21.2%, p= 0.001). At COVID-19 diagnosis, patients with a non-severe form were more likely to have a higher platelet count (226 G/L vs. 98 G/L, p= 0.01), while other biological characteristics did not vary between the two cohorts. In univariate analysis, shorter time from transplant to COVID-19 (before 211 days, p=0.01), pneumonia (OR 12.21 [95% CI 2.43 - 61.46], p=0.002), symptoms other than pulmonary or digestive (OR 1.21 [95% CI 1.02 - 11.16], p=0.04), immunosuppressive treatment (OR 5.97 [95% CI 0.75 - 47.42], p=0.03) , co-infection (OR 5.84 [95% CI 1.65-20.63], p=0.006) and comorbidity (OR 3.54 [95% CI 0.98-12.83], p=0.05) were associated with severe COVID-19. The only biological parameter associated with severity was a lower platelet count <71G/L (OR 28.00 [95% CI 2.07-379.25]), p=0.008. In multivariate analysis, pneumonia and other symptoms retained a significant association with severe COVID-19. Thirteen patients died of COVID-19: in univariate analysis, risk factors for death from COVID-19 were similar to the risk factors for severe COVID-19 (i.e. shorter time from alloHSCT, p=0.03; pneumonia, p=0.01; co-infection during the course of COVID-19, p<0.01, and lower platelet count, p<0.01). In multivariate analysis, none of the above mentioned factors remained significantly associated with death from COVID-19. As SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread internationally, given the lack of vaccine or treatment, alloHSCT recipients should maintain a high level of awareness to avoid contamination.

673285,Diversity of antibody responses after influenza infection or vaccination—Needed or nice to have?,2021-03-09,"Timeliness is a critical issue in preventing the spread of emerging/notifiable infectious diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or avian influenza (bird flu). Current computerized surveillance systems in many countries have demonstrated their usefulness in detecting specified communicable-diseases. However, the off-line, daily or weekly data reporting mode induces a time lag in data collection, transmission, processing, and responses. This paper proposes an on-line real-time mechanism, named EDICTS, for emerging/notifiable infectious diseases control, tracking and surveillance. It is based on the on-line health IC card system and works at the registration process of primary care practices and emergency departments. Hence, should a disease defined by CDC (Center for disease control) be detected at the registration station, EDICTS responds in real time. Note that EDICTS is a mechanism; it is CDC that determines the policy and activates it. A prototype is designed and implemented on a simulated environment of the Taiwan's national health insurance IC card system. The proposed policy and rules are defined according to the CDC regulations. Timely, sensitive and cost-effective, EDICTS complements the existing successive level of CDC reporting system as a fast-response control channel.","Huang, Jyh-Win; Hou, Ting-Wei",Comput Methods Programs Biomed,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0169260707000326; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169260707000326; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17379353/,175

Here, we report a case series of severe sinus bradycardia among patients hospitalized in intensive care units (ICU) with COVID-19. Objective and method From January to May 2020, 113 patients were admitted in ICU for severe COVID-19. All these patients underwent continuous monitoring of their cardiac rhythm. Ten patients (9%) presented a bradycardia. A 24-hour Holter-ECG was subsequently performed for 7 patients. Results Patients had a median age of 63years. Most of them were men and had severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. All episodes were due to sinus bradycardia with a median heart rate of 36 bpm. Bradycardia was sudden for four patients and required brief resuscitation maneuvers for one. Bradycardia was persistent for the six other patients and required transient continuous isoprenaline infusion for three. Patients had normal baseline ECG and echocardiography. A comprehensive review of patient's files ruled out bradycardia due to drug-drug interactions, myocarditis, hyperkalemia, hypoxia or vagal physical stimulation. Two patients had beta-blockers interrupted several days before bradycardia and one patient received Hydroxychloroquine discontinued 21days before bradycardia. On the Holter-ECG, 3 recordings evoked vagal hyperactivity (low mean heart rate and elevated pNN50/RMSSD, Fig. 1, patient A), 3 others cardiac dysautonomia (SDNN<100ms, Fig. 1, patient B). Amongst these 10 patients, five returned home and five died from COVID-19 associated multiple-organ failure. None of them required temporary or permanent cardiac pacing (Fig. 1). Conclusion We hypothesized that bradycardia may be due to an autonomic nervous system injury. The parallel course of COVID-19 and bradycardia suggest that these patients do not have intrinsic sinus node disease and that pacemaker implantation should not be recommended.","Larue, J.; Dejode, P.; Timsit, J.

As no vaccines are available for human use, continuous effort is needed to develop effective and safe vaccines to prevent ZIKV infection. In this study, we constructed three recombinant proteins comprising, respectively, residues 296–406 (E296-406), 298–409 (E298-409), and 301–404 (E301-404) of ZIKV envelope (E) protein domain III (EDIII) fused with a C-terminal Fc of human IgG. Our results demonstrated that E298-409 induced the highest titer of neutralizing antibodies against infection with nine ZIKV strains isolated from different hosts, countries, and time periods, and it maintained long-term anti-ZIKV immunogenicity to induce neutralizing antibodies. Pups born to mice immunized with E298-409 were fully protected against lethal challenge with two epidemic human ZIKV strains, 2015/Honduras (R103451) and 2015/Colombia (FLR). Passive transfer of anti-E298-409 mouse sera protected pups born to naive mice, as well as type I interferon receptor-deficient adult A129 mice, from lethal challenge with human ZIKV strains R103451 and FLR, and this protection was positively correlated with neutralizing antibodies. These data suggest that the critical neutralizing fragment (i.e., a fragment that can induce highly potent neutralizing antibodies against divergent ZIKV strains) of ZIKV EDIII is a good candidate for development as an effective and safe ZIKV subunit vaccine to protect pregnant mothers and their fetuses against ZIKV infection. The E298-409-specific antibodies can be used for passive immunization to prevent ZIKV infection in newborns or immunocompromised adults.","Tai, Wanbo; He, Lei; Wang, Yufei; Sun, Shihun; Zhao, Guangyu; Luo, Chuming; Li, Pei; Zhao, Haiyan; Fremont, Daved H.; Li, Fang; Jiang, Shibo; Zhou, Yusen; Du, Lanying",Emerg Microbes Infect,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29362446/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41426-017-0007-8,175

Our objective was therefore to describe nutritional behaviours during the lockdown period and to put them in light of individual characteristics. Methods: 37,252 French adults from the web-based NutriNet-Sante cohort filled lockdown-specific questionnaires in April-May 2020 (nutritional behaviours, body weight, physical activity, 24h-dietary records). Nutritional behaviours were compared before and during lockdown using Student paired t-tests and associated to individual characteristics using multivariable logistic or linear regression models. Clusters of nutritional behaviours were derived from multiple correspondence analysis and ascending hierarchical classification. Results: During the lockdown, trends for unfavourable nutritional behaviours were observed: weight gain (for 35%; +1.8kg on average), decreased physical activity (53%), increased sedentary time (63%), increased snacking, decreased consumption of fresh food products (especially fruit and fish), increased consumption of sweets, biscuits and cakes. Yet, opposite trends were also observed: weight loss (for 23%, -2kg on average), increased home-made cooking (40%), increased physical activity (19%). These behavioural trends related to sociodemographic and economic position, professional situation during the lockdown (teleworking or not), initial weight status, having children at home, anxiety and depressive symptoms, as well as diet quality before the lockdown. Modifications of nutritional practices mainly related to routine change, food supply, emotional reasons but also to voluntary changes to adjust to the current situation. Conclusion: These results suggest that the lockdown led, in a substantial part of the population, to unhealthy nutritional behaviours that, if maintained in the long term, may increase the nutrition-related burden of disease and also impact immunity. Yet, the lockdown situation also created an opportunity for some people to improve their nutritional behaviours, with high stakes to understand the leverages to put these on a long-term footing.","Deschasaux-Tanguy, M.; Druesne-Pecollo, N.; Esseddik, Y.; Szabo de Edelenyi, F.; Alles, B.; Andreeva, V.

Previous work had identified the presence of a 10 kDa 2b protein in virus-infected cells and the induction of an anti-2b response in PRRSV-infected pigs, as well as a possible association of 2b with the virion (Wu et al., 2001, Virology 287:183–191). In this study, we utilized two experimental approaches, including the use of a 2b peptide-specific monoclonal antibody, to demonstrate that the PRRSV 2b protein is an integral component of the PRRSV virion. This study suggests that 2b in PRRSV is similar to the E protein in EAV and forms a minor structural component of the virion.","Wu, Wai-Hong; Fang, Ying; Rowland, Raymond R.R.; Lawson, Steven R.; Christopher-Hennings, Jane; Yoon, Kyoung-Jin; Nelson, Eric A.",Virus Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16095746/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170205002200; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170205002200,175

Reports showed the increase of mental illness as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the correlation between the COVID-19 and mental illness is not fully understood yet. METHODOLOGY: We reported a brief psychotic disorder in a COVID-19 patient with no history of mental illness who was hospitalized in Persahabatan Hospital, Jakarta, Indonesia. RESULTS: Psychotic symptoms appeared five days after COVID-19 onset and laboratory tests showed elevated levels of d-dimer and fibrinogen. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated levels of d-dimer and fibrinogen suggest an ongoing COVID-19-associated coagulopathy that might cause a microdamage in the central nervous system. It might contribute to the manifestation of psychotic symptoms. The correlation between brief psychotic disorder and COVID-19 requires further investigation.","Faisal, Hana Khairina Putri; Taufik, Feni Fitriani; Sugihen, Tribowo Tuahta Ginting; Juliani, Tomu; Yunus, Faisal",J Infect Dev Ctries,https://doi.org/10.3855/jidc.14830; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34242187/,175

Hence this research study seeks to identify critical factors influencing Indian people's attitudes and intentions to take up Covid-19 vaccinations. METHODS: An online questionnaire was administered to a sample (n = 254) drawn from Indian population, to assess the impact of perceived benefits, risk perceptions, social media exposure, social norms, and trust associated with Covid-19 vaccines on people's attitudes towards Covid-19 vaccines and their intentions to take up the Covid-19 vaccinations. RESULTS: The findings showed that the perceived benefits, social norms, and trust correlated significantly with people's attitudes towards Covid-19 vaccinations. In contrast, risk perceptions and social media exposure showed an insignificant influence on people's attitudes towards Covid-19 vaccinations. Social norms, trust, and people's attitudes towards the Covid-19 vaccinations are significantly correlated with their intentions to take up Covid-19 vaccinations. On the contrary, social media exposure was found to have an insignificant influence on people's intentions to take up Covid-19 vaccinations. CONCLUSION: Participants' intentions to take up Covid-19 vaccinations was influenced mainly by their attitudes and perceptions of Covid-19 vaccines in general, which strongly confirms the importance of various dimensions (perceived benefits, trust, social norms) of Covid-19 vaccines in cultivating Covid-19 vaccination acceptance among participants’.","Mir, Hilal Hamid; Parveen, Subeena; Mullick, Naushadul Haque; Nabi, Shazia",Diabetes Metab Syndr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34000711/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1871402121001442; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dsx.2021.05.006; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1871402121001442?v=s5,175

The aim of this study was to detect early-risk alcohol consumption and alcohol dependence (ADS), the degree of adherence to the Mediterranean diet and emotional eating in university students of the Madrid community. (2) Methods: For each individual, anthropometric parameters, the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), AUDIT-Consumption (AUDIT-C), the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) and the Emotional Eater Questionnaire (EEQ) were assessed. (3) Results: A total of 584 university students aged 20.5 (sex ratio = 0.39) were enrolled in a cross-sectional study. In total, 63.6% of students showed low adherence to the Mediterranean diet, with no differences by sex (64.3% female versus 61.5% male, p = 0.19). According to the AUDIT questionnaire, 26.2% of participants were categorized as high-risk drinkers and 7.7% as ADS. About 38.6% of the students were categorized as eating very emotionally or eating emotionally, and 37.2% were categorized as low emotional eaters. A weak positive correlation was observed between the EEQ and BMI in female students (rho= 0.15, p = 0.03).

METHODS: We compared five testing strategies: 1) PCR-severe-only: PCR testing only patients with severe/critical symptoms; 2) Self-screen: PCR-severe-only plus self-assessment of COVID-19- consistent symptoms with self-isolation if positive; 3) PCR-any-symptom: PCR for any COVID-19-consistent symptoms with self-isolation if positive; 4) PCR-all: PCR-any-symptom and one-time PCR for the entire population; and, 5) PCR-all-repeat: PCR-all with monthly re-testing. We examined effective reproduction numbers (R(e), 0.9-2.0) at which policy conclusions would change. We used published data on disease progression and mortality, transmission, PCR sensitivity/specificity (70/100%) and costs. Model-projected outcomes included infections, deaths, tests performed, hospital-days, and costs over 180-days, as well as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs, $/quality-adjusted life-year [QALY]). RESULTS: In all scenarios, PCR-all-repeat would lead to the best clinical outcomes and PCR-severe-only would lead to the worst; at R(e) 0.9, PCR-all-repeat vs. PCR-severe-only resulted in a 63% reduction in infections and a 44% reduction in deaths, but required >65-fold more tests/day with 4-fold higher costs. PCR-all-repeat had an ICER <$100,000/QALY only when R(e) ≥1.8. At all R(e) values, PCR-any-symptom was cost-saving compared to other strategies. CONCLUSIONS: Testing people with any COVID-19-consistent symptoms would be cost-saving compared to restricting testing to only those with symptoms severe enough to warrant hospital care. Expanding PCR testing to asymptomatic people would decrease infections, deaths, and hospitalizations. Universal screening would be cost-effective when paired with monthly retesting in settings where the COVID-19 pandemic is surging.","Neilan, Anne M.; Losina, Elena; Bangs, Audrey C.; Flanagan, Clare; Panella, Christopher; Eskibozkurt, G.

However, most of the clinical studies have been focused on Wuhan, and little is known about the disease outside of Wuhan in China. In this retrospective cohort study, we report the early clinical features of 80 patients with COVID-19 admitted to the hospital in Beijing. The results show that 27 (33.8%) patients had severe illness. Six (7.5%) patients were admitted to the ICU, and 3 (3.8%) patients died. Forty-eight percent (39/80) of the patients had a history of living/traveling in Wuhan. Patients with severe- illness were significantly older (average age, 71 years old vs 44 years old) and had a high incidence of expectoration (59.3% vs 34.0%), shortness of breath (92.6% vs 9.4%), anorexia (51.9% vs 18.9%) and confusion(18.5% vs 0%) compared with nonsevere patients. The systolic blood pressure (median, 130 mmHg vs 120 mmHg) was higher and the oxygen saturation (median, 98.3% vs 92.0%) was significantly lower in severe patients than nonsevere patients. In addition, myoglobin (median, 56.0 ng/mL vs 35.0 ng/mL), troponin I (median, 0.02 pg/mL vs 0.01 pg/mL), C-reactive protein (median, 69.7 mg/L vs 12.9 mg/L) and neutrophils (median, 3.3×10(9)/L vs 2.2×10(9)/L) were significantly increased, while lymphocytes (median, 0.8×10(9)/L vs 1.2×10(9)/L), albumin (mean, 32.8 g/L vs 36.8 g/L) and the creatinine clearance rate (median, 91.2 vs 108.2 ml/min/1.73m(2)) were significantly decreased among severe patients.

683948,SARS-COV-2 outbreak and control in Kenya - Mathematical model analysis,2021-01-27,"Under normal physiological conditions, the lung remains an oxygen rich environment. However, prominent regions of hypoxia are a common feature of infected and inflamed tissues and many chronic inflammatory respiratory diseases are associated with mucosal and systemic hypoxia. The airway epithelium represents a key interface with the external environment and is the first line of defense against potentially harmful agents including respiratory pathogens. The protective arsenal of the airway epithelium is provided in the form of physical barriers, and the production of an array of antimicrobial host defense molecules, proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, in response to activation by receptors. Dysregulation of the airway epithelial innate immune response is associated with a compromised immunity and chronic inflammation of the lung. An increasing body of evidence indicates a distinct role for hypoxia in the dysfunction of the airway epithelium and in the responses of both innate immunity and of respiratory pathogens. Here we review the current evidence around the role of tissue hypoxia in modulating the host-pathogen interaction at the airway epithelium. Furthermore, we highlight the work needed to delineate the role of tissue hypoxia in the pathophysiology of chronic inflammatory lung diseases such as asthma, cystic fibrosis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in addition to novel respiratory diseases such as COVID-19. Elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying the epithelial-pathogen interactions in the setting of hypoxia will enable better understanding of persistent infections and complex disease processes in chronic inflammatory lung diseases and may aid the identification of novel therapeutic targets and strategies.","Page, Lee K.; Staples, Karl J.; Spalluto, C.

AIM: This study was designed to investigate the effect of Covid-19 on sleep quality, anxiety and depression in healthcare staff at a tertiary hospital. METHODS: This descriptive and cross-sectional study recruited healthcare staff working at a tertiary hospital. Those who had given their informed consent participated in this study between April 17 and May 17, 2020. Data were collected using the introductory information form, the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS). The data were then analyzed on the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) v.24. RESULTS: The mean scores of the respondents derived from the HADS-Anxiety (HADS-A) and HADS-Depression (HADS-D) scales were 7.89 ± 4.60 and 7.22 ± 4.13, respectively. Their depression levels were established to be at risk, though their anxiety levels were not. The mean PSQI score turned out to be 8.42 ± 2.30 for the participants, most of whom (92.9%) experienced poor sleep quality. Total sleep quality of the respondents exhibited a moderate positive correlation with HADS-A scores and a weak positive correlation with HADS-D scores (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Our major conclusion from the collected data is that healthcare staff suffered from poor sleep quality, and that their depression levels, but not anxiety levels, were at risk. Providing appropriate information about the health care of patients diagnosed with Covid-19 as well as offering regular psychoeducation-psychological support services and resting areas can reduce the susceptibility of healthcare staff to anxiety and depression and improve their overall sleep quality.","Tasdemir Yigitoglu, Gulay; Yilmaz, Atakan; Yilmaz, Halis",Arch Psychiatr Nurs,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34561066/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0883941721001102; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0883941721001102?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apnu.2021.07.001,175
684636,The COVIDome Explorer Researcher Portal,2021-07-28,"Limited and inconsistent testing and differences in age distribution, health care resources, social distancing, and policies have caused large variations in the extent and dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic across nations, complicating the estimation of prevalence, the infection fatality rate (IFR), and other factors important to care providers and policymakers. Using data for all 84 countries with reliable testing data (spanning 4.75 billion people) we develop a dynamic epidemiological model integrating data on cases, deaths, excess mortality and other factors to estimate how asymptomatic transmission, disease acuity, hospitalization, and behavioral and policy responses to risk condition prevalence and IFR across nations and over time. For these nations we estimate IFR averages 0.68% (0.64%-0.7%). Cases and deaths through June 18, 2020 are estimated to be 11.8 and 1.48 times official reports, respectively, at 88.5 (85-95.3) million and 600 (586-622) thousand. Prevalence and IFR vary substantially, e.g., Ecuador (18%; 0.61%), Chile (15.5%; 0.57%), Mexico (8.8%; 0.69%), Iran (7.9%; 0.44%), USA (5.3%; 0.99%), UK (5.2%; 1.59%), Iceland (1.65%, 0.56%), New Zealand (0.1%, 0.64%), but all nations remain well below the level needed for herd immunity. By alerting the public earlier and reducing contacts, extensive testing when the pandemic was declared could have averted 35.3 (32.7-42.7) million cases and 197 (171-232) thousand deaths. However, future outcomes are less dependent on testing and more contingent on the willingness of communities and governments to reduce transmission.

684656,SARS-CoV-2 research using human pluripotent stem cells and organoids.,2021-07-24,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused myriad health, social, and economic stressors. To date, however, no known study has examined changes in mental health during the pandemic in the U.S. military veteran population. METHODS: Data were analyzed from the 2019–2020 National Health and Resilience in Veterans Study, a nationally representative, prospective cohort survey of 3078 veterans. Pre-to-peri-pandemic changes in psychiatric symptoms were evaluated, as well as pre-pandemic risk and protective factors and pandemic-related correlates of increased psychiatric distress. RESULTS: The prevalence of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) positive screens increased from pre- to peri-pandemic (7.1% to 9.4%; p < 0.001) and was driven by an increase among veterans aged 45–64 years (8.2% to 13.5%; p < 0.001), but the prevalence of major depressive disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder positive screens remained stable. Using a continuous measure of psychiatric distress, an estimated 13.2% of veterans reported a clinically meaningful pre-to-peri-pandemic increase in distress (mean = 1.1 standard deviation). Veterans with a larger pre-pandemic social network size and secure attachment style were less likely to experience increased distress, whereas veterans reporting more pre-pandemic loneliness were more likely to experience increased distress. Concerns about pandemic-related social losses, mental health COVID-19 effects, and housing stability during the pandemic were associated with increased distress, over-and-above pre-pandemic factors. CONCLUSIONS: Although most U.S. veterans showed resilience to mental health problems nearly 1 year into the pandemic, the prevalence of GAD positive screens increased, particularly among middle-aged veterans, and one of seven veterans experienced increased distress. Clinical implications of these findings are discussed.","Hill, Melanie L.; Nichter, Brandon; Na, Peter J.; Norman, Sonya B.; Morland, Leslie A.; Krystal, John H.; Pietrzak, Robert H.",Psychological medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34120667/; https://doi.org/10.1017/s0033291721002361,175
685605,A Next-Generation Sequencing Data Analysis Pipeline for Detecting Unknown Pathogens from Mixed Clinical Samples and Revealing Their Genetic Diversity,2016-03-17,"Upstream of the 3’-untranslated region in the SARS-CoV-2 genome is ORF10 which has been proposed to encode for the ORF10 protein. Current research is still unclear on whether this protein is synthesized, but further investigations are still warranted. Herein, this study uses multiple bioinformatic tools to biochemically and functionally characterize the ORF10 protein, along with predicting its tertiary structure. Results indicate a highly ordered, hydrophobic, and thermally stable protein that contains at least one transmembrane region. This protein also possesses high residue protein-binding propensity, primarily in the N-terminal half. An assessment of forty-one missense mutations reveal slight changes in residue flexibility, mainly in the C-terminal half. However, these same mutations do not inflict significant changes on protein stability and other biochemical features. The predicted model suggests the ORF10 protein contains a β-α-β motif with a β-molecular recognition feature occurring in the first β-strand. Functionally, the ORF10 protein could be a membrane protein. A single pocket was identified in this protein but found to possess low druggability. The ORF10 itself consists of two distinct lineages: the SARS-CoV lineage and the SARS-CoV-2 lineage. Evidence of strong positive selection (dN/dS = 4.01) and purifying selection (dN/dS = 0.713) were found within the SARS-CoV-2 lineage and SARS-CoV lineage, respectively. Collectively, these results continue to assess the biological relevance of ORF10 and its putatively encoded protein, thereby aiding in diagnostic and possibly vaccine development.","Schuster, Noah A.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.26.355784,175

In Canada, the International Mobility Program (IMP) has become the dominant mechanism for temporary migrant workers to enter into Canada, and yet, this stream has operated largely below the radar of public debate. Our article focuses on International Experience Canada (IEC), a category of the IMP allowing young people to work and travel in Canada. Based on documentary, survey and interview material with IEC participants, we investigate how the IEC regulatory framework influences the employment and immigration experiences of these young workers. We argue that, instead of being a form of privileged youth mobility, the IEC is composed of multiple regulations resulting in significant variations in conditions of admission and stay among migrant workers. This situation leads to differentiated employment conditions and uneven transitions to permanent residence.","Coderre, Mylène; Nakache, Delphine",J Int Migr Integr,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12134-021-00873-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34305462/,175

The World Health Assembly produced a resolution to try to address the crisis at its May 2007 meeting. I examine how the parties to this controversy used international law in framing and negotiating the dispute. Specifically, I analyze Indonesia’s use of the international legal principle of sovereignty and its appeal to rules on the protection of biological and genetic resources found in the Convention on Biological Diversity. In addition, I consider how the International Health Regulations 2005 applied to the controversy.

686651,Utilization of Nucleic Acid Amplification Assays for the Detection of Respiratory Viruses,2009-11-03,"BACKGROUND: Epidemic modelling studies predict that physical distancing is critical in containing COVID-19. However, few empirical studies have validated this finding. Our study evaluates the effectiveness of different physical distancing measures in controlling viral transmission. METHODS: We identified three distinct physical distancing measures with varying intensity and implemented at different times—international travel controls, restrictions on mass gatherings, and lockdown-type measures—based on the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker. We also estimated the time-varying reproduction number (R(t)) for 142 countries and tracked R(t) temporally for two weeks following the 100th reported case in each country. We regressed R(t) on the physical distancing measures and other control variables (income, population density, age structure, and temperature) and performed several robustness checks to validate our findings. FINDINGS: Complete travel bans and all forms of lockdown-type measures have been effective in reducing average R(t) over the 14 days following the 100th case. Recommended stay-at-home advisories and partial lockdowns are as effective as complete lockdowns in outbreak control. However, these measures have to be implemented early to be effective. Based on the observed median timing across countries worldwide, lockdown-type measures are considered early if they were instituted about two weeks before the 100th case and travel bans a week before detection of the first case. INTERPRETATION: A combination of physical distancing measures, if implemented early, can be effective in containing COVID-19—tight border controls to limit importation of cases, encouraging physical distancing, moderately stringent measures such as working from home, and a full lockdown in the case of a probable uncontrolled outbreak.","Koh, Wee Chian; Naing, Lin; Wong, Justin",Int J Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.08.026; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S120197122030655X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S120197122030655X?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32800859/,175

687392,Stem cells and COVID-19: are the human amniotic cells a new hope for therapies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus?,2021-03-01,"Intensive care unit healthcare workers (ICU HCW) are at risk of mental health issues during emerging disease outbreaks. A study of ICU HCW from France revealed symptoms of anxiety and depression in 50.4% and 30.4% of workers at the peak of the first wave of the pandemic. The level of COVID-19 exposure of these ICU HCW was very high. In Canada, ICU HCW experienced variable exposure to COVID-19 during the first wave of the pandemic, with some hospitals seeing large numbers of patients while others saw few or none. In this study we examined the relationship between COVID-19 exposure and mental health in Canadian ICU HCW. We conducted a cross-sectional cohort study of Canadian ICU HCW in April 2020, during the acceleration phase of the first wave of the pandemic. Psychosocial distress was assessed using the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). Participants were asked about sources of stress as well as about exposure to COVID-19 patients and availability of personal protective equipment (PPE). Factors associated with clinically-relevant psychosocial distress were identified. Responses were received from 310 Canadian ICU HCW affiliated with more than 30 institutions. Of these, 64.5% scored ≥ 3 points on the GHQ-12 questionnaire, indicating clinically-relevant psychosocial distress. The frequency of psychosocial distress was highest amongst registered nurses (75.7%) and lowest amongst physicians (49.4%). It was also higher amongst females (64.9%) than males (47.6%). Although PPE availability was good (> 80% of participants reported adequate availability), there was significant anxiety with respect to PPE availability, with respect to the risk of being infected with COVID-19, and with respect to the risk of transmitting COVID-19 to others. In multivariable regression analysis, Anxiety with respect to being infected with COVID-19 (OR 1.53, CI 1.31–1.81) was the strongest positive predictor of clinically-relevant psychosocial distress while the Number of shifts with COVID-19 exposure (OR 0.86, CI 0.75–0.95) was the strongest negative predictor. In summary, clinically-relevant psychosocial distress was identified amongst a majority of ICU HCW during the acceleration phase of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, including those with minimal or no exposure to COVID-19. Strategies to support mental health amongst ICU HCW are required across the entire healthcare system.","Binnie, Alexandra; Moura, Kyra; Moura, Claire; D’Aragon, Frédérick; Tsang, Jennifer L.

As hospitals struggle to identify and care for those afflicted with COVID-19, it is easy to overlook endemic diseases that potentially worsen or mimic the pulmonary manifestations or may coinfect those with COVID-19.

689513,Laboratory Detection of Respiratory Viruses by Automated Techniques,2012-11-30,"Natural selection operating on the genomes of viral pathogens in different host species strongly contributes to adaptation facilitating host colonization. Here, we analyse, quantify and compare viral adaptation in genomic sequence data derived from seven zoonotic events in the Coronaviridae family among primary, intermediate and human hosts. Rates of nonsynonymous (d (N)) and synonymous (d (S)) changes on specific amino acid positions were quantified for each open reading frame (ORF). Purifying selection accounted for 77% of all sites under selection. Diversifying selection was most frequently observed in viruses infecting the primary hosts of each virus and predominantly occurred in the orf1ab genomic region. Within all four intermediate hosts, diversifying selection on the spike gene was observed either solitarily or in combination with orf1ab and other genes. Consistent with previous evidence, pervasive diversifying selection on coronavirus spike genes corroborates the role this protein plays in host cellular entry, adaptation to new hosts and evasion of host cellular immune responses. Structural modelling of spike proteins identified a significantly higher proportion of sites for SARS‐CoV‐2 under positive selection in close proximity to sites of glycosylation relative to the other coronaviruses. Among human coronaviruses, there was a significant inverse correlation between the number of sites under positive selection and the estimated years since the virus was introduced into the human population. Abundant diversifying selection observed in SARS‐CoV‐2 suggests the virus remains in the adaptive phase of the host switch, typical of recent host switches. A mechanistic understanding of where, when and how genomic adaptation occurs in coronaviruses following a host shift is crucial for vaccine design, public health responses and predicting future pandemics.","Montoya, Vincent; McLaughlin, Angela; Mordecai, Gideon J.; Miller, Rachel L.; Joy, Jeffrey B.",J Evol Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33751699/; https://doi.org/10.1111/jeb.13771,175
