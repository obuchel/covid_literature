283,Bayesian Phylogeography Finds Its Roots,2009-09-25,"As a key factor in endemic and epidemic dynamics, the geographical distribution of viruses has been frequently interpreted in the light of their genetic histories. Unfortunately, inference of historical dispersal or migration patterns of viruses has mainly been restricted to model-free heuristic approaches that provide little insight into the temporal setting of the spatial dynamics. The introduction of probabilistic models of evolution, however, offers unique opportunities to engage in this statistical endeavor. Here we introduce a Bayesian framework for inference, visualization and hypothesis testing of phylogeographic history. By implementing character mapping in a Bayesian software that samples time-scaled phylogenies, we enable the reconstruction of timed viral dispersal patterns while accommodating phylogenetic uncertainty. Standard Markov model inference is extended with a stochastic search variable selection procedure that identifies the parsimonious descriptions of the diffusion process. In addition, we propose priors that can incorporate geographical sampling distributions or characterize alternative hypotheses about the spatial dynamics. To visualize the spatial and temporal information, we summarize inferences using virtual globe software. We describe how Bayesian phylogeography compares with previous parsimony analysis in the investigation of the influenza A H5N1 origin and H5N1 epidemiological linkage among sampling localities. Analysis of rabies in West African dog populations reveals how virus diffusion may enable endemic maintenance through continuous epidemic cycles. From these analyses, we conclude that our phylogeographic framework will make an important asset in molecular epidemiology that can be easily generalized to infer biogeogeography from genetic data for many organisms.","Lemey, Philippe; Rambaut, Andrew; Drummond, Alexei J.; Suchard, Marc A.",PLoS Comput Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2740835/,134
2553,Intracranial Injection of Dengue Virus Induces Interferon Stimulated Genes and CD8(+) T Cell Infiltration by Sphingosine Kinase 1 Independent Pathways,2017-01-17,"We have previously reported that the absence of sphingosine kinase 1 (SK1) affects both dengue virus (DENV) infection and innate immune responses in vitro. Here we aimed to define SK1-dependancy of DENV-induced disease and the associated innate responses in vivo. The lack of a reliable mouse model with a fully competent interferon response for DENV infection is a challenge, and here we use an experimental model of DENV infection in the brain of immunocompetent mice. Intracranial injection of DENV-2 into C57BL/6 mice induced body weight loss and neurological symptoms which was associated with a high level of DENV RNA in the brain. Body weight loss and DENV RNA level tended to be greater in SK1(-/-) compared with wildtype (WT) mice. Brain infection with DENV-2 is associated with the induction of interferon-β (IFN-β) and IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) expression including viperin, Ifi27l2a, IRF7, and CXCL10 without any significant differences between WT and SK1(-/-) mice. The SK2 and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) levels in the brain were unchanged by DENV infection or the lack of SK1. Histological analysis demonstrated the presence of a cellular infiltrate in DENV-infected brain with a significant increase in mRNA for CD8 but not CD4 suggesting this infiltrate is likely CD8(+) but not CD4(+) T-lymphocytes. This increase in T-cell infiltration was not affected by the lack of SK1. Overall, DENV-infection in the brain induces IFN and T-cell responses but does not influence the SK/S1P axis. In contrast to our observations in vitro, SK1 has no major influence on these responses following DENV-infection in the mouse brain.","Al-Shujairi, Wisam H.; Clarke, Jennifer N.; Davies, Lorena T.; Alsharifi, Mohammed; Pitson, Stuart M.; Carr, Jillian M.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5240945/,134

3470,A benchmark driven guide to binding site comparison: An exhaustive evaluation using tailor-made data sets (ProSPECCTs),2018-11-08,"The automated comparison of protein-ligand binding sites provides useful insights into yet unexplored site similarities. Various stages of computational and chemical biology research can benefit from this knowledge. The search for putative off-targets and the establishment of polypharmacological effects by comparing binding sites led to promising results for numerous projects. Although many cavity comparison methods are available, a comprehensive analysis to guide the choice of a tool for a specific application is wanting. Moreover, the broad variety of binding site modeling approaches, comparison algorithms, and scoring metrics impedes this choice. Herein, we aim to elucidate strengths and weaknesses of binding site comparison methodologies. A detailed benchmark study is the only possibility to rationalize the selection of appropriate tools for different scenarios. Specific evaluation data sets were developed to shed light on multiple aspects of binding site comparison. An assembly of all applied benchmark sets (ProSPECCTs–Protein Site Pairs for the Evaluation of Cavity Comparison Tools) is made available for the evaluation and optimization of further and still emerging methods. The results indicate the importance of such analyses to facilitate the choice of a methodology that complies with the requirements of a specific scientific challenge.","Ehrt, Christiane; Brinkjost, Tobias; Koch, Oliver",PLoS Comput Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6224041/,134

These similarities are even more striking than those reported previously between viral proteins and the encephalitogenic myelin basic protein (MBP). These findings, along with other reports of molecular mimicry by viruses, suggest that immunological cross‐reactions between virus‐induced antibodies or T‐cells and analogous antigenic determinants (epitopes) in myelin proteolipid could be involved in the pathophysiology of multiple sclerosis or post‐infectious demyelinating syndromes.","Shaw, Shyh-Yu; Laursen, Richard A.; Lees, Marjorie B.",FEBS Lett,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7130213/,134

The phosphorylated regions consist largely of repeating tetrapeptides with two basic residues flanking Ser-Pro residues (‘SPKK’ motifs) and are predicted to have β-turn secondary structures. Alteration of the charge and structure of the SPKK sites may play a role in the unusually dense DNA packaging of the mature sperm chromatin. The motif resembles the target site of cell-cycle-associated cdc2 kinases and is found in several other proteins whose nucleic acid affinities may be altered during the cell cycle.","Poccia, Dominic L.; Green, G.R.",Trends Biochem Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7135322/,134
9734,THE AUSTRALIAN COLLEGE OF VETERINARY SCIENTISTS—PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS 1978,2008-03-10,"ABSTRACT. We report a case of methionine synthase deficiency associated with cellular immune deficiency discovered in a 14‐year‐old boy. Principal findings were: developmental delay, recurrent upper and lower respiratory tract infections, megaloblastic anemia, discovered at 3 months of age, unresponsive to cyanocobalamin and poorly responsive to folinic acid. Biochemical studies showed: an abnormal deoxyuridine suppression test despite normal serum folate, cobalamin and transcobalamin levels; a normal intracellular uptake of these two coenzymes; and an absolute requirement of methionine for fibroblast growth, suggestive of defective methionine synthesis. An absence of methionine synthase activity in the patient's bone marrow and a profound depression of this activity in lymphocytes and liver were found. Hypergammaglobulinemia with variable lymphopenia, depressed lymphocyte transformation after lectin or recall‐antigen stimulation, defective delayed‐type hypersensitivity and decreased natural killer activity were noted as well. The patient died at the age of 14.","ZITTOUN, J.; FISCHER, A.; MARQUET, J.; PERIGNON, J. L.; LAGRUE, A.; GRISCELLI, C.",Acta Paediatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7159520/,134
10974,Thoracoscopic repair of esophageal atresia with distal tracheoesophageal fistula: is it a safe procedure in infants weighing less than 2000 g?,2020-04-22,"Neuromuscular blocking agents play a significant role in improving the success rate for urgent intubation, although there is limited evidence about the effect on subsequent outcomes, such as the incidence of tracheostomy. In this retrospective cohort study, we aimed to examine the association between avoidance of neuromuscular blocking agents for urgent tracheal intubation and incidence of tracheostomy among patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). The setting of this study was an eight-bed ICU at a tertiary-care hospital in Okayama, Japan. We included patients who underwent urgent tracheal intubation at the emergency department or the ICU and were admitted to the ICU between April 2013 and November 2017. We extracted data on methods and medications of intubation, predictors for difficult intubation, Cormack–Lehane grade, patient demographics, primary diagnoses, reintubation. We estimated odds ratios and their 95% confidence intervals for elective tracheostomy during the ICU stay using logistic regression models. Of 411 patients, 46 patients underwent intubation without neuromuscular blocking agents and 61 patients underwent tracheostomy. After adjusting for potential confounders, patients who avoided neuromuscular blocking agents had more than double the odds of tracheostomy (odds ratio 2.59, 95% confidence interval 1.06–6.34, p value = 0.04). When stratifying the subjects by risk status for tracheostomy, the association was more pronounced in high-risk group, while we observed less significant association in the low-risk group. Avoidance of neuromuscular blocking agents for urgent intubation increases the risk of tracheostomy among emergency patients, especially those who have a higher risk for tracheostomy.

However, there is paucity of data about its effect in Indian patients undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). METHODS: Seven hundred forty-eight patients underwent off-pump CABG from January 2015 to December 2016 (24 months). One hundred twenty-seven patients (16.7%) developed POAF. In an effort to mitigate the effects of wider risk factors on perioperative outcomes, a separate sub-analysis of patients based on risks quantified by EuroSCORE II (<> 3) was also performed. RESULTS: Age > 60 years and development of sepsis were the independent predictors for the development of POAF. Thirty-day/mortality rate was higher in the POAF group (7.1% vs. 1.4%; p value < 0.001). POAF was associated with increased ICU and hospital stay and increased incidence of stroke and renal dysfunction. The survival was significantly lower in the POAF group compared with the normal sinus rhythm (NSR) (3-year survival in POAF was 81.3% vs. 94.4% in the NSR group; Hazard ratio (HR) 3.867 (1.989–7.516)). Intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) usage, age ≥ 60 years and sepsis were independent predictors for the development of POAF in low-risk patients. For the NSR group, 1-year survival was 98% and 3-year survival was 95.7%. For the POAF group, 1-year survival was 94.4% and 3-year survival was 84.0% (HR. 3.794 (1.897–7.591)). CONCLUSION: The incidence of POAF was lower than reported in the wider global literature. Increasing age and development of post-operative sepsis were strong independent predictors of POAF. POAF increases the morbidity; length of hospital stay and these patients show decreased survival after off-pump CABG.","Ghurram, Akhil; Krishna, Neethu; Bhaskaran, Renjitha; Kumaraswamy, Natarajan; Jayant, Aveek; Varma, Praveen Kerala",Indian J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7222924/,134
11408,"Outcomes in conventional laparoscopic versus robotic-assisted revisional bariatric surgery: a retrospective, case–controlled study of the MBSAQIP database",2019-06-17,"Ebola virus disease (EVD) is a severe and frequently lethal disease caused by Ebola virus (EBOV). EVD outbreaks typically start from a single case of probable zoonotic transmission, followed by human-to-human transmission via direct contact or contact with infected bodily fluids or contaminated fomites. EVD has a high case–fatality rate; it is characterized by fever, gastrointestinal signs and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Diagnosis requires a combination of case definition and laboratory tests, typically real-time reverse transcription PCR to detect viral RNA or rapid diagnostic tests based on immunoassays to detect EBOV antigens. Recent advances in medical countermeasure research resulted in the recent approval of an EBOV-targeted vaccine by European and US regulatory agencies. The results of a randomized clinical trial of investigational therapeutics for EVD demonstrated survival benefits from two monoclonal antibody products targeting the EBOV membrane glycoprotein. New observations emerging from the unprecedented 2013–2016 Western African EVD outbreak (the largest in history) and the ongoing EVD outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo have substantially improved the understanding of EVD and viral persistence in survivors of EVD, resulting in new strategies toward prevention of infection and optimization of clinical management, acute illness outcomes and attendance to the clinical care needs of patients.","Jacob, Shevin T.; Crozier, Ian; Fischer, William A.; Hewlett, Angela; Kraft, Colleen S.; Vega, Marc-Antoine de La; Soka, Moses J.; Wahl, Victoria; Griffiths, Anthony; Bollinger, Laura; Kuhn, Jens H.",Nat Rev Dis Primers,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223853/,134
13751,Erratum: Prediction of human population responses to toxic compounds by a collaborative competition,2015-10-08,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the clinical efficacy of topical tacrolimus 0.1% and cyclosporine 1% on high-risk penetrating keratoplasty (PKP) patients. SUBJECTS/METHODS: A series of 49 high-risk PKP patients (49 eyes), 20 males, 29 females from the age of 4 months to 74 years of age with the mean of 32.5 from 2012 to 2017 were recruited in this study. The patients were randomly divided into two groups by receiving either topical tacrolimus 0.1% or cyclosporine 1% respectively. Twenty five patients were treated with topical tacrolimus 0.1% and 24 patients with topical cyclosporine 1%. The traditional baseline management on these two groups were Tobramycin and Dexamethasone eye drops in the first 3 weeks and then tapered off. Clinical procedures and postoperative follow-up were documented. RESULTS: After 6–54 months follow-up, with the average of 24 months, 11 of 24 high-risk patients (11 eyes) had graft rejection, the rejection rate was 45.8% in topical cyclosporine 1% group. The rejections occurred from 35 days to 20 months after PKP. Three patients had irreversible rejection. On topical tacrolimus 0.1% group, the rejection occurred in four patients (four eyes) with rejection rate of 16%, and no irreversible rejection was observed. The graft rejection episodes were documented between 23 days and 24 months. As compared with the topical cyclosporine 1%, topical tacrolimus 0.1%, a key immunosuppressant, significantly decreased corneal graft rejection rate (p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Topical tacrolimus 01% on high-risk PKP patients significantly prevented corneal graft rejection, and it had less adverse effects and was very safe to high-risk patients as to topical cyclosporine 1%. Further case controlled randomized clinical trial studies are needed to establish the best management option for these high-risk patients.","Zhai, Li-Ying; Zhang, Xiao-Rong; Liu, Huan; Ma, Yue; Xu, Hong-Chang",Eye (Lond),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7608310/,134

In this paper, we present a technology-enabled clinical audit tool, termed Medical Service Transformation and Innovation Compass (MYSTIC), which has transformed the way the clinical audit is performed in our EMS department. MYSTIC is a Python program we developed in-house, that extracts data from data fields found in routine ambulance case records maintained by our paramedics, and automatically assigns “pass” or “fail” flags based on pre-defined audit criteria. Compared to previous manual auditing, implementation of the MYSTIC computerized audit system increased the coverage of cases undergoing audit from 10% to 100% of all EMS-attended cases, and we were able to promptly identify and address some deficits in training and knowledge amongst our paramedics.","Ng, Qin Xiang; Yeung, Wesley Lok Kin; Tay, Joey Ai Meng; Arulanandam, Shalini",Healthcare (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8143507/,134
17800,Measures Matter—Determining the True Nutri-Physiological Value of Feed Ingredients for Swine,2021-04-27,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Most thyme and basil species are characterized by a great chemical diversity. Uses have been developed through centuries in foods, as a source of essential oil, flavors, and antioxidants. The main aim of this study was to produce volatile metabolites using cell suspensions of Thymus vulgaris and Ocimum basilicum from the Al-Ahsa area in the sub-continental region. We surveyed the antifeedant activity of extracted volatile metabolites and the inhibition of extracts against total proteolytic enzyme activity from the red palm weevil Rhynchophorus ferrugineus (Oliver), (Coleoptera: Curculionidae). Thymus vulgaris was the most active extract, characterized not only by feeding inhibition but also by a growing deterrence on R. ferrugineus larvae. The O. basilicum extract also showed a lower range of biological activity; nevertheless, there was potent insecticidal activity. The high insecticidal activity of the T. vulgaris extract could be attributed to the high diversity of its volatile constituents. One of the merits of the current approach is that the outcomes are applicable and have the environmental goal of producing ecofriendly biopesticides. ABSTRACT: The current study was designed to investigate the insecticide role of volatile constituents produced from cell suspensions of T. vulgaris and O. basilicum against R. ferrugineus. Constituents were extracted from cell suspension after 40 days. Growth kinetics were measured with an inoculation of Verticillium dahliae and identified by GC-MS. Total volatile phenolic constituents were measured. Insecticidal activity against R. ferrugineus (adult) and proteolytic enzyme activity in larvae were assessed. GC-MS showed that the T. vulgaris extract has higher amounts of thymol, p-cymene, γ-terpinene, β-caryophyllene, and linalool in comparison to the O. basilicum extract, which is rich in estragole, β-terpineol, (E)-β-ocimene, 1,8-cineole, germacrene D, and eugenol. The T. vulgaris extract showed an LC(50) of 1032 µg/mL, followed by O. basilicum with an LC(50) of 1246 µg/mL. The IC(50) values against the total proteases were 110.8 and 119.4 µg/mL for T. vulgaris and O. basilicum, respectively. The IC(50) for the trypsin-like serine proteinase assessment was 81.6 and 91 µg/mL for T. vulgaris and O. basilicum, respectively. Cysteine, chymotrypsin, and metalloproteinase assessment showed an IC(50) above 5000 µg/mL for both extracts. The study is proposed as a potential approach to use T. vulgaris and O. basilicum extract as a bio-insecticide against R. ferrugineus using an accessible and efficient cell suspension technique.","Darrag, Hossam Moustafa; Alhajhoj, Mohammed Refdan; Khalil, Hany Ezzat",Insects,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8147177/,134

We conducted secondary analysis of questions submitted, which were ‘out‐of‐scope’ of the original survey aim. We sought to disseminate these questions, to inform practice, policy and the development of potential interventions to support young people with cancer. DESIGN: James Lind Alliance Priority Setting Partnership. PARTICIPANTS: Young people aged 13‐24 with a current/previous cancer diagnosis, their families/friends/partners and professionals who work with this population. METHODS: Eight hundred and fifty‐five potential research questions were submitted, and 326 were classified as ‘out‐of‐scope’. These questions, along with 49 ‘free‐text’ comments, were analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: The 375 out‐of‐scope questions and comments were submitted by: 68 young people, 81 family members/partners/friends and 42 professionals. Ten overarching themes were identified: diagnostic experience; communication; coordination of care; information needs and lack of information; service provision; long‐term effects and aftercare support; family support; financial impact; end‐of life care; and research methods and current research. CONCLUSIONS: The need to tailor services, information and communication is a striking thread evidenced across the ‘out‐of‐scope’ questions.

21969,"Analysing the HERV-K env, np9, rec and gag expression in cervical tissues",2021-09-02,"BACKGROUND: ICU-acquired weakness (ICUAW) has been shown to be associated with prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation and extubation failure. It is usually assessed through Medical Research Council (MRC) score, a time-consuming score performed by physiotherapists. Handgrip strength (HG) can be monitored very easily at the bedside. It has been shown to be a reproducible and reliable marker of global muscular strength in critical care patients. We sought to test if muscular weakness, as assessed by handgrip strength, was associated with extubation outcome. METHODS: Prospective multicenter trial over an 18 months period in six mixed ICUs. Adults receiving mechanical ventilation for at least 48 h were eligible. Just before weaning trial, HG, Maximal Inspiratory Pressure (MIP), Peak Cough Expiratory Flow (PCEF) and Medical Research Council (MRC) score were registered. The attending physicians were unaware of the tests results and weaning procedures were conducted according to guidelines. Occurrence of unscheduled reintubation, non-invasive ventilation (NIV) or high-flow nasal continuous oxygen (HFNC) because of respiratory failure within 7 days after extubation defined extubation failure. The main outcome was the link between HG and extubation outcome. RESULTS: 233 patients were included. Extubation failure occurred in 51 (22.5%) patients, 39 (17.2%) required reintubation. Handgrip strength was 12 [6–20] kg and 12 [8–20] kg, respectively, in extubation success and failure (p = 0.85). There was no association between extubation outcome and MRC score, MIP or PCEF. Handgrip strength was well correlated with MRC score (r = 0.718, p < 0.0001). ICU and hospital length of stay were significantly higher in the subset of patients harboring muscular weakness as defined by handgrip performed at the first weaning trial (respectively, 15 [10–25] days vs. 11 [7–17] days, p = 0.001 and 34 [19–66] days vs. 22 [15–43] days, p = 0.002). CONCLUSION: No association was found between handgrip strength and extubation outcome. Whether this was explained by the appropriateness of the tool in this specific setting, or by the precise impact of ICUAW on extubation outcome deserves to be further evaluated.

While risk factors such as lifestyle patterns, genetic traits, blood lipid levels, and diabetes can contribute to its development, advancing age remains the most determinant predictor of cardiac disease. Several parameters of left ventricular function may be affected with aging, including increased duration of systole, decreased sympathetic stimulation, and increased left ventricle ejection time, while compliance decreases. In addition, changes in cardiac phenotype with diastolic dysfunction, reduced contractility, left ventricular hypertrophy, and HF, all increase in incidence with age. Given the limited capacity that the heart has for regeneration, reversing or slowing the progression of these abnormalities poses a major challenge.

We will also review new information and indications on older agents that are relevant to clinical practice. Many of them may be unfamiliar to Emergency Physicians given their newness and at times hospital restrictions on their use. We also review some new promising agents that are not yet in the clinical pipeline. RECENT FINDINGS: As new antibiotics become available for clinicians to use, new information becomes available with respect to the drugs’ indications, efficacy, pathogen resistance, drug-drug interactions, and side effects. SUMMARY: This article provides Emergency Department clinicians with a useful summary with new information on antibiotic use and recent research into agents which may become available.","Garber, Boris; Glauser, Jonathan",Curr Emerg Hosp Med Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7296288/,134
42478,Europa,2020-11-24,"Space is produced by a society in accordance with its habits, and habits, mostly in the Western society, have been heavily influenced by forms of production. Indeed, it is widely acknowledged that the Industrial Revolution definitely changed the space of modern landscapes, cities and dwellings life at all scales, and the way in which we perceive them. Cognitive capitalism is no exception. Since it fully established itself as one of the prevailing economic forces in the 21st century and in the Western world, it produced deep changes in the way in which people work, connect, and live. Starting from the assumption that changes in means of production generate new social relationships, this paper investigates how these changes might result in new ways of building architectural space. Without indulging in a deterministic attitude, it focuses on housing as one of the fundamental artefacts where a society expresses its approach to space. The house is a basic element of complex urban systems and is, therefore, the one calling for a more radical conceptual rethinking, marking an effective distance with the forms inherited from the previous centuries. Finally, the paper aims at understanding the repercussions of the digital paradigm on the space of dwelling, reasoning on some crucial questions to understand how housing might evolve, unfolding through its spatial configuration the new ways of life of the digital society.","Spanedda, Francesco; Fusaro, Matteo Carmine",City Territ Archit,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7676404/,134
44331,Serum Adipocytokines Levels and Their Association with Insulin Sensitivity in Morbidly Obese Individuals Undergoing Bariatric Surgery,2020-12-30,"BACKGROUND: The hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α)/vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/VEGF receptor subtype 2 (VEGFR-2) pathway has been implicated in ischemia/reperfusion injury. The aim of this study was to clarify whether whole-body hypothermic targeted temperature management (HTTM) inhibits the HIF-1α/VEGF/VEGFR-2 pathway in a swine model of cardiac arrest (CA) and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). METHODS: Twenty-four domestic male Beijing Landrace pigs were used in this study. CA was electrically induced with ventricular fibrillation and left untreated for 8 min. Return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) was achieved in 16 pigs, which were randomly assigned either to normothermia at 38 °C or to HTTM at 33 °C (each group: n = 8). HTTM was intravascularly induced immediately after ROSC. The core temperature was reduced to 33 °C and maintained for 12 h after ROSC. The serum levels of HIF-1α, VEGF, VEGFR-2, and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) were measured with enzyme immunoassay kits 0.5, 6, 12, and 24 h after ROSC. The expression of HIF-1α, VEGF, and VEGFR-2 in cerebral cortical tissue was measured by RT-PCR and Western blot analysis 24 h after ROSC. Neurological deficit scores and brain cortical tissue water content were evaluated 24 h after ROSC. RESULTS: The serum levels of HIF-1α, VEGF, and VEGFR-2 were significantly increased under normothermia within 24 h after ROSC. However, these increases were significantly reduced by HTTM. HTTM also decreased cerebral cortical HIF-1α, VEGF, and VEGFR-2 mRNA and protein expression 24 h after ROSC (all p < 0.05). HTTM pigs had better neurological outcomes and less brain edema than normothermic pigs. CONCLUSION: The HIF-1α/VEGF/VEGFR-2 system is activated following CA and CPR. HTTM protects against cerebral injury after ROSC, which may be part of the mechanism by which it inhibits the expression of components of the HIF-1α/VEGF/VEGFR-2 signaling pathway.","Li, Jiebin; Li, Chunsheng; Yuan, Wei; Wu, Junyuan; Li, Jie; Li, Zhenhua; Zhao, Yongzhen",Neurocrit Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7785329/,134

DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Scopus, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, SPORTDiscus and the Cochrane Library. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trails (RCTs) or meta-analyses (MAs) of controlled trials that: (1) involved healthy adults>18 year with hypertension; (2) investigated exercise and BP; (3) reported preintervention and postintervention BP and (4) were published in English. RCTs had an EX+MEDScombined arm; and an EXalone arm and/or an MEDSalone arm; and MAs performed moderator analyses. DESIGN: A systematic network MA and meta-review with the evidence graded using the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans Advisory Committee system. OUTCOME: The BP response for EXalone, MEDSalone and EX+MEDScombined and compared with each other. RESULTS: Twelve RCTs qualified with 342 subjects (60% women) who were mostly physically inactive, middle-aged to older adults. There were 13 qualifying MAs with 28 468 participants (~50% women) who were mostly Caucasian or Asian. Most RCTs were aerobic (83.3%), while the MAs involved traditional (46%) and alternative (54%) exercise types. Strong evidence demonstrates EXalone, MEDSalone and EX+MEDScombined reduce BP and EX+MEDScombined elicit BP reductions less than the sum of their parts. Strong evidence indicates EX+MEDScombined potentiate the BP effects of MEDSalone. Although the evidence is stronger for alternative than traditional types of exercise, EXaloneelicits greater BP reductions than MEDSalone. CONCLUSIONS: The combined BP effects of exercise and medications are not additive or synergistic, but when combined they bolster the antihypertensive effects of MEDSalone.

58830,Microplastics in mangroves and coral reef ecosystems: a review,2021-10-07,"INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the sleep of adult patients of a multidisciplinary sleep clinic. METHODS: Patients were invited to complete online surveys: Survey 1 in October 2020 (increased COVID-19 restrictions) followed by Survey 2 in February 2021 (after easing of restrictions for a COVIDSafe summer). RESULTS: Of the 746 patients invited to participate, 73 completed and 8 partially returned Survey 1 (mean age 50.1 years, range 21–83 years, 58% female). Subsequently, 46 completed and 5 partially answered Survey 2. In Survey 1, 22/74 (29.7%) reported reduced sleep quantity and 31/75 (41.3%) indicated worse sleep quality compared with prior to the pandemic. In Survey 2, 33/46 (71.7%) described unchanged sleep quantity whilst 5/46 (10.9%) reported increased sleep quantity since easing COVID-19 restrictions. 36/46 (78.3%) indicated unchanged sleep quality whereas 5/46 (10.9%) described improved sleep quality since easing restrictions. However, 9/46 (19.6%) reported that their sleep remained worse compared with pre-pandemic. For patients who completed both surveys, there was no significant change in Insomnia Severity Index scores (Survey 1 mean 13.6, Survey 2 mean 12.9, mean difference -0.67 [95%CI -2.02, 0.68], p=0.32) or PROMIS Sleep-Related Impairment 8a T-scores (Survey 1 mean 59.0, Survey 2 mean 59.5, mean difference 0.44 [95%CI -1.55, 2.42], p=0.66). DISCUSSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected the sleep of 44% of patients. Following easing of restrictions, symptoms of insomnia and sleep-related impairment did not change significantly, and 19.6% reported that their sleep was not back to their pre-pandemic baseline.","Ng, Y; Nguyen, E; Bei, B; Hamilton, G; Rajaratnam, S; Ou, C; Mansfield, D",Sleep Adv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8500137/,134

59552,Robotic surgery for rectal cancer.,2017,"The widespread use of multiplex molecular diagnostics has led to a significant increase in the detection of respiratory viruses in patients undergoing cytotoxic chemotherapy and hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Respiratory viruses initially infect the upper respiratory tract and then progress to lower respiratory tract disease in a subset of patients. Lower respiratory tract disease can manifest itself as airflow obstruction or viral pneumonia, which can be fatal. Infection in HCT candidates may require delay of transplantation. The risk of progression differs between viruses and immunosuppressive regimens. Risk factors for progression and severity scores have been described, which may allow targeting treatment to high-risk patients. Ribavirin is the only antiviral treatment option for noninfluenza respiratory viruses; however, high-quality data demonstrating its efficacy and relative advantages of the aerosolized versus oral form are lacking. There are significant unmet needs, including data defining the virologic characteristics and clinical significance of human rhinoviruses, human coronaviruses, human metapneumovirus, and human bocavirus, as well as the need for new treatment and preventative options.","Waghmare, Alpana; Englund, Janet A; Boeckh, Michael",Blood,https://doi.org/10.1182/blood-2016-01-634873; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26968533/,134
60224,Interested in virtual EMS with Vet Record?,2020-08-22,"It is generally believed that reflex recruitment of pharyngeal dilator muscles is insufficient to open the airway of obstructive apnea (OSA) patients once it is closed and, therefore, that arousal is required. Yet arousal promotes recurrence of obstruction. There is no information about how much dilator [genioglossus (GG)] activation is required to open the airway (GG Opening Threshold) or about the capacity of reflex mechanisms to increase dilator activity before/without arousal (Non-Arousal Activation). The relationship between these two variables is important for ventilatory stability. We measured both variables in 32 OSA patients (apnea-hypopnea index 74 ± 42 events/h). GG activity was monitored while patients were on optimal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). Zopiclone was administered to delay arousal. Maximum GG activity (GG(MAX)) and airway closing pressure (P(CRIT)) were measured. During stable sleep CPAP was decreased to 1 cmH(2)O to induce obstructive events and the dial-downs were maintained until the airway opened with or without arousal. GG activity at the instant of opening (GG Opening Threshold) was measured. GG Opening Threshold averaged only 10.4 ± 9.5% GG(Max) and did not correlate with P(CRIT) (r = 0.04). Twenty-six patients had >3 openings without arousal, indicating that Non-Arousal Activation can exceed GG Opening Threshold in the majority of patients. GG activity reached before arousal in Arousal-Associated Openings was only 5.4 ± 4.6% GG(MAX) below GG Opening Threshold. We conclude that in most patients GG activity required to open the airway is modest and can be reached by non-arousal mechanisms. Arousals occur in most cases just before non-arousal mechanisms manage to increase activity above GG Opening Threshold. Measures to reduce GG Opening Threshold even slightly may help stabilize breathing in many patients.","Younes, Magdy; Loewen, Andrea H S; Ostrowski, Michele; Laprairie, John; Maturino, Frances; Hanly, Patrick J",Journal of applied physiology,https://doi.org/10.1152/japplphysiol.00312.2011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21921245/,134
60572,It is time to rethink EMS.,2020-10-31,"BACKGROUND Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (SAB) presents heterogeneously, owing to the differences in underlying host conditions and immune responses. Although Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) is important in recognizing S. aureus, its function during S. aureus infection remains controversial. We aimed to examine the association of TLR2 expression and associated cytokine responses with clinical SAB outcomes. METHODS Patients from a prospective SAB cohort at two tertiary-care medical centers were enrolled. Blood was sampled at several timepoints (≤5 d, 6-9 d, 10-13 d, 14-19 d, and ≥ 20 d) after SAB onset. TLR2 mRNA levels were determined via real-time PCR and serum tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-α, interleukin [IL]-6, and IL-10 levels were analyzed with multiplex-high-sensitivity electrochemiluminescent ELISA. RESULTS TLR2 levels varied among 59 SAB patients. On days 2-5, TLR2 levels were significantly higher in SAB survivors than in healthy controls (p = 0.040) and slightly but not significantly higher than non-survivors (p = 0.120), and SAB patients dying within 7 d had lower TLR2 levels than survivors (P = 0.077) although statistically insignificant. IL-6 and IL-10 levels were significantly higher in non-survivors than in survivors on days 2-5 post-bacteremia (P = 0.010 and P = 0.021, respectively), and those dying within 7 d of SAB (n = 3) displayed significantly higher IL-10/TNF-α ratios than the survivors did (P = 0.007). CONCLUSION TLR2 downregulation and IL-6 and IL-10 concentrations suggestive of immune dysregulation during early bacteremia may be associated with mortality from SAB. TLR2 expression levels and associated cytokine reactions during early-phase SAB may be potential prognostic factors in SAB, although larger studies are warranted.","Kim, Nak-Hyun; Sung, Ji Yeon; Choi, Yoon Jung; Choi, Su-Jin; Ahn, Soyeon; Ji, Eunjeong; Kim, Moonsuk; Kim, Chung Jong; Song, Kyoung-Ho; Choe, Pyoeng Gyun; Park, Wan Beom; Kim, Eu Suk; Park, Kyoung Un; Kim, Nam-Joong; Oh, Myoung-Don; Kim, Hong Bin",BMC infectious diseases,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-020-05641-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33256638/,134

Seven 5-0, nonabsorbable, nylon suture brands were tensile tested in straight, knotted and knot-security configurations according to the procedures outlined by the United States Pharmacopeia for the tensile testing of sutures. Covidien, the cheapest brand tested, had the highest failure load of straight and knot-security tests. Dafilon was found to have the highest breaking force and percent elongation of knot-pull tests.

60664,Cost-utility analysis of bariatric surgery compared with conventional medical management in Germany: a decision analytic modeling.,2017,"Exposure to nitrate is toxic to aquatic animals due to the formation of methaemoglobin and a subsequent loss of blood-oxygen carrying capacity. Yet, nitrate toxicity can be modulated by other stressors in the environment, such as elevated temperatures. Acclimation to elevated temperatures has been shown to offset the negative effects of nitrate on whole animal performance in fish, but the mechanisms underlying this cross-tolerance interaction remain unclear. In this study, juvenile silver perch (Bidyanus bidyanus) were exposed to a factorial combination of temperature (28 °C or 32 °C) and nitrate concentrations (0, 50 or 100 mg NO3- L-1) treatments to test the hypothesis that thermal acclimation offsets the effects of nitrate via compensatory changes to the cardiorespiratory system (gills, ventricle and blood oxygen carrying capacity). Following 21 weeks of thermal acclimation, we found that fish acclimated to 32 °C experienced an expansion of gill surface area and an increase in ventricular thickness regardless of nitrate exposure concentration. Exposure to nitrate (both 50 and 100 mg NO3- L-1) reduced the blood oxygen carrying capacity of silver perch due to increases in methaemoglobin concentration and a right shift in oxygen-haemoglobin binding curves in fish from both thermal acclimation treatments. These results indicate that plasticity of the gills and ventricle of warm acclimated fish are potential mechanisms which may provide cross-tolerance protection to elevated nitrate concentrations despite nitrate induced reductions to oxygen transport.","Gomez Isaza, Daniel F; Cramp, Rebecca L; Franklin, Craig E",Comparative biochemistry and physiology.

60712,On-chip micromanipulation and assembly of colloidal particles by electric fields.,2006-08-16,"OBJECTIVE In the past few years, increasing numbers of Indigenous doula collectives have been forming across Canada. Indigenous doulas provide continuous, culturally appropriate support to Indigenous women during pregnancy, birth, and the post-partum period. This support is critical to counter systemic medical racism and socioeconomic barriers that Indigenous families disproportionately face. This paper analyzes interviews with members of five Indigenous doula collectives to demonstrate their shared challenges, strategies, and missions. METHODS Qualitative interviews were conducted with members of five Indigenous doula collectives across Canada in 2020. Interviews were transcribed and returned to participants for their approval. Approved transcripts were then coded by all members of the research team to ascertain the dominant themes emerging across the interviews. RESULTS Two prominent themes emerged in the interviews. The first theme is ""Indigenous doulas responding to community needs."" Participants indicated that responding to community needs involves harm reduction and trauma-informed care, supporting cultural aspects of birthing and family, and helping clients navigate socioeconomic barriers. The second theme is ""Indigenous doulas building connections with mothers."" Participants' comments on providing care to mothers emphasize the importance of advocacy in healthcare systems, boosting their clients' confidence and skills, and being the ""right"" doula for their clients. These two inter-related themes stem from Indigenous doulas' efforts to counter dynamics in healthcare and social services that can be harmful to Indigenous families, while also integrating cultural teachings and practices. CONCLUSION This paper illustrates that Indigenous doula care responds to a wide range of issues that affect Indigenous women's experiences of pregnancy, birth, and the post-partum period. Through building strong, trusting, and non-judgemental connections with mothers and responding to community needs, Indigenous doulas play a critical role in countering medical racism in hospital settings and advancing the resurgence of Indigenous birthing sovereignty.","Cidro, Jaime; Doenmez, Caroline; Sinclair, Stephanie; Nychuk, Alexandra; Wodtke, Larissa; Hayward, Ashley",International journal for equity in health,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12939-021-01521-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34446010/,134

DESIGN Systematic review. SETTING Search on four databases, Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and the European Network for Health Technology Assessment planned and ongoing projects database. PATIENTS Patients with sepsis/septic shock; patients undergoing cardiac surgery. INTERVENTIONS Cytokine adsorption. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Randomized controlled trials and prospective studies with concurrent control were eligible for the evidence synthesis. The quality of the individual studies and the strength of the available evidence were assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach, respectively. For the preventive treatment of extracorporeal cytokine adsorption therapy in patients undergoing cardiac surgery, we found very low-quality inconclusive evidence for mortality (five randomized controlled trials, n = 163), length of stay in the ICU (five randomized controlled trials, n = 163), and length of hospitalization (three randomized controlled trials, n = 101). Very low-quality inconclusive evidence was found for (serious) adverse events (four randomized controlled trials, n = 148). For the therapeutic treatment of extracorporeal cytokine adsorption therapy in patients with sepsis/septic shock, we found very low-quality inconclusive evidence for mortality up to 60-day follow-up (two randomized controlled trials, n = 117), organ function (two randomized controlled trials, n = 117) and length of stay in the ICU (one randomized controlled trial, n = 20). Very low-quality inconclusive evidence was found for (serious) adverse events (two randomized controlled trials, n = 117). CONCLUSIONS Given the available evidence, the efficacy and safety of extracorporeal cytokine adsorption therapy in combination with standard care in the investigated indications was not established. We strongly recommend considering well-powered studies with patient-relevant endpoints instead of investing further research funds on studies that may not shed light on the clinical benefit of extracorporeal cytokine adsorption therapy.","Goetz, Gregor; Hawlik, Katharina; Wild, Claudia",Critical care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/ccm.0000000000005023; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33935160/,134
60738,TAMIS resection of a large colonic polyp 20 cm from the anal verge: could endo-stapling be the solution to peritoneal entry?,2019,"BACKGROUND Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly evolved as a viral pandemic. Countries worldwide have been affected by the recent outbreak caused by the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome)-CoV-2 virus. As with prior viral pandemics, health-care workers are at increased risk. Orthopaedic surgical procedures are common in health-care systems, ranging from emergency to elective procedures. Many orthopaedic surgical procedures are life or limb-saving and cannot be postponed during the COVID-19 pandemic because of potential patient harm. Our goal is to analyze how orthopaedic surgeons can perform medically necessary procedures during the pandemic and to help guide decision-making perioperatively. METHODS We performed a review of the existing literature regarding COVID-19 and prior viral outbreaks to help guide clinical practice in terms of how to safely perform medically necessary orthopaedic procedures during the pandemic for both asymptomatic patients and high-risk (e.g., COVID-19-positive) patients. We created a classification system based on COVID-19 positivity, patient health status, and COVID-19 prevalence to help guide perioperative decision-making. RESULTS We advocate that only urgent and emergency surgical procedures be performed. By following recommendations from the American College of Surgeons, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the recent literature, safe orthopaedic surgery and perioperative care can be performed. Screening measures are needed for patients and perioperative teams. Surgeons and perioperative teams at risk for contracting COVID-19 should use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), including N95 respirators or powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs), when risk of viral spread is high. When preparing for medically necessary orthopaedic procedures during the pandemic, our classification system will help to guide decision-making. A multidisciplinary care plan is needed to ensure patient safety with medically necessary orthopaedic procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS Orthopaedic surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic can be performed safely when medically necessary but should be rare for COVID-19-positive or high-risk patients. Appropriate screening, PPE use, and multidisciplinary care will allow for safe medically necessary orthopaedic surgery to continue during the COVID-19 pandemic. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE Prognostic Level V.

Public health evaluates the incidence of infections and death, which should be reduced and need desperately quarantines for infected individuals. This article review refers to the roles of Ginkgo Biloba to reduce the risk of infection in the respiratory tract, the details on the epidemiology of corona COVID-19 and influenza, and it highlights how the Ginko Biloba could have been used as a novel treatment.Ginkgo Biloba can reduce the risk of infection by several mechanisms; these mechanisms involve Ginkgo Biloba contains quercetin and other constituents, which have anti-inflammatory and immune modulator effects by reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines concentrations. Cytokines cause inflammation which have been induced the injuries in lung lining.Some observational studies confirmed that Ginkgo Biloba reduced the risk of asthma, sepsis and another respiratory disease as well as it reduced the risk of cigarette smoking on respiratory symptoms. While other evidences suggested the characters of Ginkgo Biloba as an antivirus agent through several mechanisms. Ginkgolic acid (GA) can inhibit the fusion and synthesis of viral proteins, thus, it inhibit the Herpes Simplex Virus type1 (HSV-1), genome replication in Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and the infections of the Zika Virus (ZIKV). Also, it inhibits the wide spectrum of fusion by inhibiting the three types of proteins that have been induced fusion as (Influenza A Virus [IAV], Epstein Barr Virus [EBV], HIV and Ebola Virus [EBOV]).The secondary mechanism of GA targeting inhibition of the DNA and protein synthesis in virus, greatly have been related to its strong effects, even afterward the beginning of the infection, therefore, it potentially treats the acute viral contaminations like (Measles and Coronavirus COVID-19). Additionally, it has been used topically as an effective agent on vigorous lesions including (varicella-zoster virus [VZV], HSV-1 and HSV-2). Ginkgo Biloba may be useful for treating the infected people with coronavirus COVID-19 through its beneficial effect.

61074,Functional Duration of Closure Systems Used in Partial Nephrectomy.,2016,"BACKGROUND How adolescent substance use and perceived availability of substances have changed during the COVID-19 pandemic remain largely unknown. Substantial reduction in availability of substances would present a unique opportunity to consider the supply-side hypothesis that reductions in drug availability will lead to reductions in drug prevalence. METHODS Longitudinal data come from Monitoring the Future and are based on responses from 582 adolescents who were originally surveyed as part of a national sample of 12th grade students in early 2020, one month before social distancing policies began. They were surveyed again after social distancing policies were implemented, in the summer of 2020. RESULTS Perceived availability of marijuana and alcohol declined across the two survey waves at the largest levels ever recorded in the 46 years of the project, by an absolute 17 %, p < .01 and 24 %, p < .01, respectively. Despite these declines, prevalence levels did not significantly change across the two waves for marijuana use in the past 30 days or for binge drinking in the past two weeks. Perceived availability of vaping devices significantly declined, from 73 % to 63 %, as did nicotine vaping prevalence in the past 30 days, from 24 % to 17 %. CONCLUSIONS Perceived availability of marijuana, alcohol, and vaping devices declined at historic rates during the pandemic of 2020. Lack of accompanying reductions in prevalence for marijuana and binge drinking demonstrates the substantial challenges facing a supply-side approach to the reduction of adolescent use of these substances.","Miech, Richard; Patrick, Megan E; Keyes, Katherine; O'Malley, Patrick M; Johnston, Lloyd",Drug and alcohol dependence,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2021.108822; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34214884/,134
61254,Conclusive proof needed for animal virus reservoirs.,2020-03-21,"In 1994, a technique of omental flap interposition to cover the celiac and mesenteric vessels after pancreaticoduodenectomy was described. It aimed to isolate the pancreatic anastomosis from the vessels dissected during pancreaticoduodenectomy. In liver transplantation (LT), the omental flap was initially used to reduce the risk of hepatic artery (HA) kinking. Currently, we use this technique to cover the dissected HA, reducing the consequences of postoperative biliary fistula (BF), particularly the risk of postoperative complications (thrombosis/bleeding). We describe this technique adding a simple modification consisting of covering the HA with an omental flap after completion of the biliary anastomosis. We performed LT with an omental flap to cover the HA vessels in 62 (55 %) of the 112 consecutive patients who underwent LT between January 2012 and July 2013. No postoperative deaths occurred. The rate of BF was 9.7 % (six cases). In the omental flap series, no postoperative thrombosis, HA pseudoaneurysm, or complications occurred. In the six cases of BF, the dissected HAs were completely isolated from the biloma. This simple technique has no specific morbidity; it isolates the HA from the biliary anastomosis and therefore may reduce the risk of severe postoperative HA complications after LT.","Panaro, Fabrizio; Bouyabrine, Hassan; Carabalona, Jean-Pierre; Nougaret, Stephanie; Jung, Boris; Pageaux, Georges Philippe; Navarro, Francis",Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11605-014-2484-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24567171/,134
61286,Laparoscopically assisted vaginal pull-through for high urogenital sinus: a new surgical technique.,2012,"With the selection of partially saturated 2H-indazoles as model compounds, we demonstrate the possibility to use Whelk-O1 chiral stationary phases (CSPs) to succeed in efficient small-scale preparative enantioseparations. Runs of three consecutive liquid chromatography injections (about 300 μg of racemate repeatedly injected in a 100 μL loop) produced groups of peaks without band contamination (α = 1.2 and RS = 2.57). With this procedure approximately 3.0 mg of each enantiomer, with enantiomeric excess ≥ 97% were obtained. Very profitably, the high volatility of n-hexane used as the sole eluent facilitated the solvent evaporation after the enantiomer recovery. High resolution mass spectrometry analysis confirmed that the chemical identity of the two enantiomers was preserved along the entire process. The ability of Whelk-O1 phases in enantioseparating structurally similar compounds was confirmed with the analysis of other two racemates. Moreover, the relevant chemoselectivity exhibited by the CSP towards the three racemates should allow to simultaneously optimizing the enantioselectivity of different analytes and perform small-scale enantioresolutions of different compounds during the same run. In this study, the integration of experimental off-line electronic circular dichroism analysis with ab initio time-dependent density-functional theory simulations facilitated the assignment of the absolute configuration of the single enantiomers, while a molecular dynamics protocol can be useful to make a priori predictions of the enantioseparation ability of CSP towards selected compounds.","Ianni, Federica; Cerra, Bruno; Shandiz, Shiva Tali; Michele, Alessandro Di; Saluti, Giorgio; Galarini, Roberta; Gioiello, Antimo; Sardella, Roccaldo; Carotti, Andrea",Journal of chromatography.

61294,[Current state of single-port transumbilical surgery in urology: challenges and applications].,2013,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE Sex differences in responses to intestinal ischemia-reperfusion (IR) have been recognized in animal studies. We aimed to investigate sexual dimorphism in human small intestinal mucosal responses to IR. METHODS In 16 patients (8 men and 8 women) undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy, an isolated part of jejunum was subjected to IR. In each patient, intestinal tissue and blood was collected directly after 45 minutes of ischemia without reperfusion (45I-0R), after 30 minutes of reperfusion (45I-30R), and after 120 minutes of reperfusion (45I-120R), as well as a control sample not exposed to IR, to assess epithelial damage, unfolded protein response (UPR) activation, and inflammation. RESULTS More extensive intestinal epithelial damage was observed in males compared to females. Intestinal fatty acid binding protein (I-FABP) arteriovenous (V-A) concentrations differences were significantly higher in males compared to females at 45I-0R (159.0 [41.0-570.5] ng/mL vs 46.9 [0.3-149.9] ng/mL). Male intestine showed significantly higher levels of UPR activation than female intestine, as well as higher number of apoptotic Paneth cells per crypt at 45I-30R (16.4% [7.1-32.1] vs 10.6% [0.0-25.4]). The inflammatory response in male intestine was significantly higher compared to females, with a higher influx of neutrophils per villus at 45I-30R (4.9 [3.1-12.0] vs 3.3 [0.2-4.5]) and a higher gene expression of TNF-α and IL-10 at 45I-120R. CONCLUSION The human female small intestine seems less susceptible to IR-induced tissue injury than the male small intestine. Recognition of such differences could lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies to reduce IR-associated morbidity and mortality.","Hundscheid, Inca H R; Schellekens, Dirk H S M; Grootjans, Joep; Derikx, Joep P M; Buurman, Wim A; Dejong, Cornelis H C; Lenaerts, Kaatje",Annals of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/sla.0000000000003167; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30614877/,134

The objective of this cross-sectional study is to evaluate differences in excess BMI loss (%EBMIL) 1 year after surgery in patients older and younger than 45 years. METHODS Adult obese patients fulfilling selection criteria underwent either Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy and were grouped according to age < and ≥45 years with follow-up at least 1 year. Both groups were compared in terms of excess BMI loss (%EBMIL) and other clinical outcomes. Possible relationship between %EBMIL, age, surgical technique, and presence of comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension (HT), and dyslipidemia (DL) was searched. RESULTS Three hundred thirty-seven patients (72.5 % female), 196 (50.1 %) younger than 45 years and 141 (49.9 %) with age ≥45 years. There was significant difference between age group and %EBMIL 12 months after surgery (p < 0.001), showing better results in younger patients. No differences were found in terms of gender, preoperative body mass index (BMI), surgical technique, nor presence of DL. Using multiple regression, we found significant interaction effect between age group (p < 0.001), presence of HT (p = 0.001), and %EBMIL at follow-up. CONCLUSIONS Patients younger than 45 years lose greater amount of excess BMI than older patients after bariatric surgery.

Against the background of the promises-expectations of an ethically and ecologically renewed and resilient world (declared needed to compensate and to avoid the repetition of the pandemic tragedy), the same methodology proposed in the heart of the Covid scenario has been applied: a cultural metanalysis - transversal through and comprehensive of the various points of view which have had ( and seem to have) an important role for a period defined as 'some light at the end of the tunnel'. After the mandatory priority of a focus on the most qualified health literature, the survey provides essential elements of information and analysis on scenarios which more closely coincide with the challenges to be faced if and when the imaginary of a 'different-better' world should be translated into reality, specifically in the model area of health. With the obvious limitation of an exercise of methodology (which cannot pretend to a completeness of coverage), both world famous and 'significant' authors are included, as well as Italian voices. The take-home - not easy - message is clear. The pandemic has not been an 'health-disease' event. Its 'syndemic' nature (i.e. its interaction with structural, permanent, economic, social, cultural pandemics) imposes the acceptance and the long-term pursuit of new civilisation paradigms. Health care is definitely one of the areas where this cultural challenge must be met.","Tognoni, Gianni",Assistenza infermieristica e ricerca : AIR,https://doi.org/10.1702/3634.36148; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34180913/,134

62019,Inhibition of PAI-1 Promotes Lipolysis and Enhances Weight Loss in Obese Mice.,2021-02-16,"Readout signal multiplexing is a commonly used method to reduce the electronics cost in PET systems, and calculation of the scintillation coordinates typically is done by using a Center of Gravity (CoG) technique due to its simplicity and ease of implementation. This comes with a drawback, since CoG has a non-linear response at the periphery of the detector due to the lack of weights beyond the detector. Detectors with multiplexed readout that are based on finely segmented scintillators and coarsely segmented photosensors are known to suffer from the so called edge effect where a pile-up of the reconstructed coordinates from the edge crystals is observed. This may lead to incorrect assignment of the events to crystal pixels and result in formation of erroneous lines of response causing a degradation of spatial resolution and reduction of image contrast. To overcome abovementioned limitations in gamma ray detectors with multiplexed photosensor readout, we propose to use modified Gaussian Position Weighted Center of Gravity technique for calculation of gamma ray interaction position. Here the proposed method is applied to PET detectors with 24×24 LYSO crystals read out by 8 × 8 SiPM array with 64:16 row/column multiplexing. Furthermore, we compared the modified Gaussian Position Weighted Center of Gravity (PW-CoG) and Truncated Center of Gravity (TCoG) coordinate reconstruction methods. It was observed that both algorithms resolve peaks corresponding to events registered in the crystal pixels on the periphery of the crystal array, however peak-to-valley ratios and crystal resolvability metrics for PW-CoG algorithm are generally greater.","Poladyan, Harutyun; Bubon, Oleksandr; Teymurazyan, Aram; Senchurov, Sergii; Reznik, Alla",Physics in medicine and biology,https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6560/ab9357; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408285/,134

Despite the benefits of AAC systems, they are significantly underutilized by the people with complex communication needs. The current review aimed to synthesize the barriers and facilitators to the provision and use of low-tech and unaided AAC systems. Materials and methods: Relevant literature was identified via a systematic search strategy. Included articles (n = 43) were evaluated using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme. Qualitative framework analysis was then completed with reference to the International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF). Results and conclusion: Most barriers and facilitators were coded as contextual factors within the ICF. Of most prominence were environmental factors, including attitudes of and supports provided by professionals, family members, and the society at large. Themes were also identified which related to the personal factors, including the user's own attitude, socioeconomic status, and culture. Beyond these contextual factors, the remaining codes related to body functions such as cognition and movement. There are numerous barriers to the provision and use of low-tech and unaided AAC systems, which may contribute to the inadequate use of these systems by people with complex communication needs. Suggestions for reducing these barriers are presented with regards to the person with complex communication needs, their family, and the professionals involved in their care. Implications for Rehabilitation AAC systems can reduce participation restrictions for people with complex communication needs. The provision and use of AAC systems is influenced by environmental factors, personal factors, and features of a person's body function. SLPs may need to collaborate with a large multidisciplinary team to successfully introduce AAC systems. SLP, teaching, and nursing students require theoretical and practical experience in AAC throughout their training to enable the provision and use of these systems.","Moorcroft, A; Scarinci, N; Meyer, C",Disability and rehabilitation.

62820,Natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery for colorectal cancer.,2017,"INTRODUCTION Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is increasingly used in cardiac arrest (CA). Adequacy of carotid and coronary blood flows (CaBF, CoBF) and coronary perfusion pressure (CoPP) in ECMO treated CA is not well established. This study compares femoro-femoral (FF) to femoro-subclavian (FS) ECMO and intraaortic balloon counterpulsation (IABP) contribution based on CaBF, CoBF, CoPP, myocardial and brain oxygenation in experimental CA managed by ECMO. METHODS In 11 female pigs (50.3 ± 3.4 kg), CA was randomly treated by FF versus FS ECMO ± IABP. Animals under general anesthesia had undergone 15 minutes of ventricular fibrillation (VF) with ECMO flow of 5 to 10 mL/kg/min simulating low-flow CA followed by continued VF with ECMO flow of 100 mL/kg/min. CaBF and CoBF were measured by a Doppler flow wire, cerebral and peripheral oxygenation by near infrared spectroscopy. CoPP, myocardial oxygen metabolism and resuscitability were determined. RESULTS CaBF reached values > 80% of baseline in all regimens. CoBF > 80% was reached only by the FF ECMO, 90.0% (66.1, 98.6). Addition of IABP to FF ECMO decreased CoBF to 60.7% (55.1, 86.2) of baseline, P = 0.004. FS ECMO produced 70.0% (49.1, 113.2) of baseline CoBF, significantly lower than FF, P = 0.039. Addition of IABP to FS did not change the CoBF; however, it provided significantly higher flow, 76.7% (71.9, 111.2) of baseline, compared to FF + IABP, P = 0.026. Both brain and peripheral regional oxygen saturations decreased after induction of CA to 23% (15.0, 32.3) and 34% (23.5, 34.0), respectively, and normalized after ECMO institution. For brain saturations, all regimens reached values exceeding 80% of baseline, none of the comparisons between respective treatment approaches differed significantly. After a decline to 15 mmHg (9.5, 20.8) during CA, CoPP gradually rose with time to 68 mmHg (43.3, 84.0), P = 0 .003, with best recovery on FF ECMO. Resuscitability of the animals was high, both 5 and 60 minutes return of spontaneous circulation occured in eight animals (73%). CONCLUSIONS In a pig model of CA, both FF and FS ECMO assure adequate brain perfusion and oxygenation. FF ECMO offers better CoBF than FS ECMO. Addition of IABP to FF ECMO worsens CoBF. FF ECMO, more than FS ECMO, increases CoPP over time.","Bělohlávek, Jan; Mlček, Mikuláš; Huptych, Michal; Svoboda, Tomáš; Havránek, Stěpán; Ošt'ádal, Petr; Bouček, Tomáš; Kovárník, Tomáš; Mlejnský, František; Mrázek, Vratislav; Bělohlávek, Marek; Aschermann, Michael; Linhart, Aleš; Kittnar, Otomar",Critical care,https://doi.org/10.1186/cc11254; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22424292/,134

The authors describe an innovative procedure applicable after massive weight loss: the lipo-body lift method. The authors describe their experience with this novel, safe procedure. METHODS Twenty-five abdominal body-contouring reconstructions following massive weight loss were treated by means of circumferential lipo-body lift. The authors describe the indications for the procedure and their perioperative and postoperative management. RESULTS The mean patient age was 39.4 years. The mean pre-body lift body mass index was 26.71 kg/m; the average weight loss before surgery was 56.6 kg, with a mean delta body mass index loss of 20.82 kg/m. The average hospital stay was 3.52 days and the drainage duration 3.56 days. No patient experienced any major complication (e.g., hematoma, thromboembolism, bleeding, skin necrosis, or a need for revision surgery to treat complications). Minor complications including wound dehiscence, wound infection, and fat necrosis were reported in 40 percent of patients. The occurrence of complications was associated with smoking status (p = 0.0280), the volume of liposuction (p = 0.0399), and the liposuction volume per unit of body mass index (p = 0.0071). CONCLUSIONS The authors' novel technique is less invasive than the traditional lower body-lifting method, as shown by the absence of major complications, and allows excellent conservation of connective tissue and vessels; undermining is minimal. As obesity becomes a major problem worldwide, lifting procedures that are safe and effective are important components of reconstructive strategies and should be widely offered to patients who experience massive weight loss.

Such information is unreliable and has very little value in assessing programmatic quality and impact. Regular monitoring of key process and outcome indicators based on data collected through a robust information system is essential to ensure quality of a screening programme. Fragmented health systems, limited resources and absence of a culture of systematic evaluation are the major hindrances for most of the LMICs to build electronic information systems to manage screening. The COVID-19 pandemic has created an impetus for the countries to customize the freely available District Health Information Software (DHIS2) to collect electronic data to track the outbreaks and manage containment measures. In the present article we present Bangladesh as an exemplar LMIC that has a (DHIS2) based integrated health information system gradually upgraded to collect individual data of the participants to the national cervical cancer screening program. Such efforts paid rich dividends as the screening program was switched from opportunistic to a population-based one. Moreover, the electronic system could report impact of the pandemic on cancer screening on a monthly basis. The aggregate number of women screened in the year 2020 was 14.1% less compared to 2019. The monthly rate of screening during peak of the outbreak was only 5.1% of the previous year. The rate rapidly recovered as the program intensified screening in the hard-to-reach regions less affected by the pandemic and expanded the outreach services. Other LMICs may emulate Bangladesh example. Customizing the information system developed for pandemic surveillance to collect cancer screening data will help them build back the screening programs better.","Basu, Partha; Lucas, Eric; Zhang, Li; Muwonge, Richard; Murillo, Raul; Nessa, Ashrafun",Preventive medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ypmed.2021.106624; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34023359/,134

The purpose of this review is to provide an update on azole resistance mechanisms and their epidemiology in A. fumigatus, the clinical implications of azole resistance, and to discuss future treatment options against azole-resistant aspergillosis. RECENT FINDINGS Resistance may develop through either patient or environmental azole exposure. Environmental exposure is the most prevalent means of resistance development, and these isolates can cause disease in various at-risk groups, which now include those with influenza, and potentially COVID-19. Although current treatment options are limited, newer therapies are in clinical development. These include agents with novel mechanisms of action which have in vitro and in vivo activity against azole-resistant A. fumigatus. SUMMARY Azole-resistant A. fumigatus is an emerging threat that hampers our ability to successfully treat patients with aspergillosis. Certain geographic regions and patient populations appear to be at increased risk for this pathogen. As new patient groups are increasingly recognized to be at increased risk for invasive aspergillosis, studies to define the epidemiology and management of azole-resistant A. fumigatus are critically needed. While treatment options are currently limited, new agents under clinical development may offer hope.","Wiederhold, Nathan P; Verweij, Paul E",Current opinion in infectious diseases,https://doi.org/10.1097/qco.0000000000000662; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32657965/,134

This observational incidence study compared all suicide-related presentations at the University Hospital Reina Sofia emergency department (ED) in Cordoba, Spain, for the lockdown period from 15 March to 15 May 2020, with the same period in 2019. Descriptive and inferential analyses of case characteristics between 2019 and 2020 periods were conducted, and a multivariable logistic regression model developed. Results: Despite a decrease in overall ED cases during the lockdown, the number of suicide-related presentations stayed the same and represented a significantly larger proportion of cases in comparison to the pre-COVID period (0.42 vs. 0.87%, in 2019 and 2020, respectively; p < .001). The number presenting alone more than doubled during the COVID lockdown, increasing to 42.9% compared with 19.4% in 2019 (p = .002). An increase in presentations with a family history of suicide was also found. Conclusions: Suicide cases represented an increased proportion of ED cases during the lockdown. Presenting to ED alone, having a family history of suicide, habitual drug consumption, and hospital admission to ICU differentiated cases between pre and during COVID periods.

63916,Electromagnetic energy sources in surgery.,2010,"By radiolabelling monomeric (m) and polymeric (p) IgA with technetium 99m (99mTc), this study assessed IgA biodistribution and tumour-targeting potency. IgA directed against carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), a colorectal cancer marker, was selected to involve IgA mucosal tropism.Ig was radiolabelled with 99mTc-tricarbonyl after derivatisation by 2-iminothiolane. 99mTc-IgA was evaluated by in vitro analysis. The biodistributions of radiolabelled anti-CEA mIgA, pIgA and IgG were compared in normal mice. Anti-CEA pIgA tumour uptake was studied in mice bearing the WiDr caecal orthotopic graft.IgA radiolabelling was obtained with a high yield, was stable in PBS and murine plasma, and did not alter IgA binding functionality (Kd ≈ 25 nM). Biodistribution studies in normal mice confirmed that radiolabelled pIgA - and to a lesser extent, mIgA - showed strong and fast mucosal tropism and a shorter serum half-life than IgG. In caecal tumour model mice, evaluation of the anti-CEA-pIgA biodistribution showed a high uptake in lung metastases, confirmed by histological analysis. However, no radioactivity uptake increase in the tumoural caecum was discerned from normal intestinal tissue, probably due to high IgA caecal natural tropism. In microSPECT/CT imaging, 99mTc-IgA confirmed its diagnostic potency of tumour in mucosal tissue, even if detection threshold by in vivo imaging was higher than post mortem studies. Contribution of the FcαRI receptor, studied with transgenic mouse model (Tsg SCID-CD89), did not appear to be determinant in 99mTc-IgA uptake.Pre-clinical experiments highlighted significant differences between 99mTc-IgA and 99mTc-IgG biodistributions. Furthermore, tumoural model studies suggested potential targeting potency of pIgA in mucosal tissues.","Carpenet, Helene; Cuvillier, Armelle; Perraud, Aurélie; Martin, Ophélie; Champier, Gaël; Jauberteau, Marie-Odile; Monteil, Jacques; Quelven, Isabelle",Oncotarget,https://doi.org/10.18632/oncotarget.19616; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28778082/,134

64024,Recurrence patterns of direct and indirect inguinal hernias in a nationwide population in Denmark.,2014,"INTRODUCTION Kinetic military units operate in austere training environments and deprivation not commonly experienced by competitive athletes. Nutritional strategies to protect against decrements in performance and potential injury risk may differ for these two groups. A cross sectional analysis was conducted to determine energy and macronutrient characteristics associated with performance metrics. MATERIALS AND METHODS 78 male subjects (age: 28.4 ± 6.0 years, height: 178.3 ± 6.7 cm, mass: 84.3 ± 9.4 kg, 8.5 ± 5.8 years of service) assigned to Marine Corps Forces Special Operations Command completed a 1-day performance assessment. Body mass, lean body mass, fat mass (FM), aerobic capacity (VO2max), lactate inflection point (LT), anaerobic power, anaerobic capacity, knee flexion strength, knee extension strength, peak knee flexion strength, and peak knee extension strength outcome values were recorded. Dietary intake was collected using automated self-administered 24-hour dietary recall (ASA24). Performance assessment scores were compared with macronutrient intake and controlled for energy intake using analysis of covariance. RESULTS Differences in knee flexion strength, knee extension strength, peak knee flexion strength, and peak knee extension strength were significant across low (LPRO), medium (MPRO), and high (HPRO) protein intake groups (p < 0.05) with LPRO performance metrics significantly lower than both MPRO and HPRO and MPRO significantly lower than HPRO. FM was significantly higher in LPRO than MPRO or HPRO (p < 0.05). Low carbohydrate intake (LCHO) was associated with greater body mass and FM compared with high (HCHO) (p < 0.05). There was no association between fat intake and any variable. CONCLUSIONS Increases in protein intake may have beneficial performance effects independent of total energy intake, while moderate increases in carbohydrate intake may not be sufficient to enhance physical performance in a special operations population.","Ross, Jeremy A; Thomas, D Travis; Winters, Joshua D; Royer, Scott D; Halagarda, Christopher J; Sheppard, Ryan; Abt, John; Heebner, Nicholas R",Military medicine,https://doi.org/10.1093/milmed/usaa151; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32633753/,134
64061,Associations between body mass index and height during childhood and adolescence and the risk of coronary heart disease in adulthood: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,2021-05-07,"OBJECTIVE Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease that was first reported in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and has since spread rapidly around the world, resulting in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The CHA2DS2-VASc score is a well-validated risk stratification tool for predicting stroke in atrial fibrillation (AFib), as well as morbidity and mortality in several entities. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between the CHA2DS2-VASc score and in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19, regardless of AFib. METHODS This multicenter, retrospective study included a total of 349 patients with COVID-19 who were hospitalized between March 15 and April 15, 2020. The CHA2DS2-VASc score of each patient was calculated. Mortality outcomes were followed up until April 25, 2020. RESULTS The CHA2DS2-VASc score was significantly higher in non-survivor COVID-19 patients than in survivor COVID-19 patients (p<0.001). Forward stepwise logistic regression analysis demonstrated that a CHA2DS2-VASc score of ≥3 (odds ratio [OR]: 12.613, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.092-51.451; p<0.001), and the leukocyte count (OR: 1.327, 95% CI: 1.145-1.538; p<0.001), C-reactive protein level (OR: 1.010, 95% CI: 1.002-1.018; p=0.012), and ferritin level (OR: 1.005, 95% CI: 1.003-1.007; p<0.001) on admission were independent predictors of in-hospital mortality of COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSION The CHA2DS2-VASc score predicted in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19, regardless of AFib.","Quisi, Alaa; Alıcı, Gökhan; Harbalıoğlu, Hazar; Genç, Ömer; Er, Fahri; Allahverdiyev, Samir; Yıldırım, Abdullah; Kurt, Ibrahim Halil",Turk Kardiyoloji Dernegi arsivi : Turk Kardiyoloji Derneginin yayin organidir,https://doi.org/10.5543/tkda.2020.03488; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33034573/,134

Depending on the location and size, these lesions often present a diagnostic challenge in terms of the low yield of traditional bronchoscopic biopsy techniques or the risks of a percutaneous biopsy approach. RECENT FINDINGS Over the last several years, several different image-guided bronchoscopy techniques have emerged, including virtual bronchoscopic navigation, electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy, radial endobronchial ultrasound, and ultrathin bronchoscopy. These technologies seek to improve both access and the diagnostic yield of PPL compared with traditional bronchoscopy and to perform with a lower complication rate than percutaneous techniques such as CT-guided trans-thoracic needle aspiration. SUMMARY These advanced bronchoscopic techniques play an increasingly common role in the evaluation and biopsy of PPL. Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy and radial endobronchial ultrasound are the most commonly used guided techniques either in isolation or in combination and have the most published data regarding clinical experience and diagnostic yield; however, none of the techniques have consistently matched the yield of CT-guided trans-thoracic needle biopsy for PPL. Overall the complication rate of image-guided bronchoscopy techniques is low with pneumothorax being the most common adverse event.","Shepherd, Ray W",Current opinion in pulmonary medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/mcp.0000000000000273; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26974127/,134
64312,Comparison between bidirectional Stratafix® barbed suture and conventional suture in laparoscopic myomectomy: a retrospective study.,2020-08-05,"Therapeutic plans (TPs) were introduced in Italy in 2004 in order to ensure the continuity in the prescription of new drugs between specialist physicians and general practitioners (GPs). Over the years this prescription tool was updated several times: starting from a paper form without any template (""paper TP"") to a template defined by AIFA to collect specific clinical information, up to a web-based form to collect all information into a database. Over time-critical issues concerning its usefulness have been raised, especially when AIFA established several extensions for TP validity to ensure the social distancing required by the covid-19 pandemic. Therefore, after several years from their establishment, pending adoption of necessary implementing of Ministerial Decree of 25th March 2020, a check of the actual impact of TPs is required, in order to plan their review. This study provide a detailed overview of all TPs active in Italy at the 11th May 2020. From Farmadati database, all drugs reimbursed by the National Health Service (class A drugs) and requiring TP were selected. The consumption of these drugs has been derived from OsMed Reports that make available data of medicines consumption and expenditure in the general population in Italy. The analysis showed that TP is required for the prescription of 935 medicinal products (9.6% of class-A drugs) and 147 different active substances (belonging to 34 different Therapeutic Groups and 66 subgroups). Out of these, 67 (46%) required a paper TP without any template, 72 (49%) a paper TP on AIFA template, and 8 (5%) a web-based TP. The Therapeutic Group with the largest number of active ingredients with TP were antidiabetics (19.7%), followed by immunomodulating and immunosuppressants (9.5%) and medications for asthma and COPD (6.8%). Consumption analysis of drugs with TP showed that this prescription tool covers 943,899,598 DDD per year, equal to 2,586,026 DDD/day. This means that TPs have a very high impact in terms of the prevalence of patients treated on the entire care process. Of all annual DDDs prescribed on TP, 46.8% concerned drugs with TP on template AIFA, 34.5% drugs with web-based TP, while the remaining 18.7% drugs with paper TP without a template. This analysis may provide the basis for an analytical case-by-case review of TP maintenance needs, trying to maximize the benefits of this tool and to reduce its possible adverse effects. This review could be helpful to ensure the appropriateness in the drug uses, to enhance the role of general medicine, and to simplify the pathways of millions of patients ensuring the continuity of their care.","Piccinni, Carlo; Addesi, Alice; Pedrini, Antonella; Esposito, Immacolata; Rampazzo, Roberta; Mezzalira, Luigi; Trentin, Luca; Font, Maria; Trotta, Francesco; Pierantozzi, Andrea; Di Filippo, Aurora; Altamura, Gianluca; Da Cas, Roberto; Martini, Nello",Recenti progressi in medicina,https://doi.org/10.1701/3584.35683; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33877085/,134

Most of these patients were elderly and had hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease, and other underlying health conditions prior to admission for COVID-19. Liver injury occurred in all seven cases during the course of the disease. Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels initially increased (1.2-times to 2.0-times the normal value, respectively) in the second week. The liver function recovered in all patients within one week of conventional liver protection treatment. Elevated serum transaminase levels in these patients were due to the COVID-19 infection but could also be related to systemic immune response caused by cytokine storm syndrome (CSS) and hepatocyte damage caused by ischemia and hypoxia. COVID-19 is highly infectious and mainly affects the lungs. In some cases, especially in patients with severe disease type, COVID-19 may also cause liver injury. The liver function of patients with severe COVID-19 should be very carefully monitored, especially if the patients are elderly and have underlying comorbidities.","Li, X; Zhang, Z-C; Zhang, P-L",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202007_22290; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32744713/,134

The experience of the first training program in Afghanistan.,2010,"BACKGROUND A recent study found that activation of disconnection and low-pressure alarms is common during mouthpiece ventilation and may represent a major limitation to its use. The aim of this bench study was: (1) to investigate the technical aspects that can influence the setting of the ventilator during mouthpiece ventilation and (2) to provide a practical setting strategy to avoid the alarm activation. METHODS Eight life-support ventilators able to deliver volume controlled ventilation were tested in a bench study using a single-limb non-vented circuit configuration connected to a standard mouthpiece. Disconnection and apnea alarm were turned off or set at the least sensitive setting. The backup frequency was set at the lowest available level. Different tidal volumes (VT) (from 500 to 1,200 mL) were tested with the rectangular and descending flow shape. For each VT, we reported the maximum set inspiratory time (TI) that allowed preventing activation of the low-pressure alarm. The presence of auto-triggering was also surveyed. RESULTS We found that a correct combination of VT and TI avoided the activation of disconnection and low-pressure alarms in all but 3 ventilators. One ventilator did not allow mouthpiece ventilation independently from the settings used. The inability to turn off the apnea alarm in two other ventilators led to the alarm going off in any tested conditions after 120 s without triggered breaths. Auto-triggering was seldom found and easily worked out, except for in one ventilator. CONCLUSIONS An appropriate alarm setting and combination of VT and TI would allow the majority of the tested ventilators to be used for mouthpiece ventilation without alarm activation.","Carlucci, Annalisa; Mattei, Alessio; Rossi, Veronica; Paracchini, Elena; Raineri, Santi Maurizio; Gregoretti, Cesare",Respiratory care,https://doi.org/10.4187/respcare.04217; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26670472/,134

Few studies have assessed for suicidal behaviors among Canadian nurses, and factors that may increase risk for suicidal behaviors are unknown. PURPOSE The current study was designed to assess past-year and lifetime suicidal behavior (i.e., ideation, plans, and attempts) using a large sample of Canadian nurses. METHOD Participants (n = 3969; 94.3% women) completed an online survey including measures of suicidal behavior and symptoms of mental disorders. RESULTS Considerable proportions of participants reported past-year and/or lifetime suicidal ideation (10.5%, 33.0%), plans (4.6%, 17.0%), and attempts (0.7%, 8.0%), considerably higher than general population estimates. Significant differences were identified across age groups, years of service, marital status, regional location, and nursing type (e.g., registered psychiatric nurses, licensed practical nurses, registered nurses). Participants who screened positive for almost all measured mental disorders had significantly higher rates of suicidal behavior. CONCLUSIONS The results necessitate further research to evaluate risk factors contributing to suicidal behavior in Canadian nurses and methods to decrease the risk (e.g., developing effective monitoring and prevention measures).","Stelnicki, Andrea M; Jamshidi, Laleh; Angehrn, Andréanne; Nicholas Carleton, R",The Canadian journal of nursing research = Revue canadienne de recherche en sciences infirmieres,https://doi.org/10.1177/0844562120934237; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32552154/,134

This review discusses the roles of natriuretic peptides and cardiac troponins. Natriuretic peptide levels are elevated during atrial strain (atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP)) or ventricular strain (B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP)). These markers correspond well with cardiac function and can be used to identify cardiac disease. Cardiac troponins are used to assess cardiomyocyte compromise. Affected cardiomyocytes release troponin into the bloodstream, resulting in elevated levels of cardiac troponin. Cardiac biomarkers are being increasingly incorporated into clinical trials as indicators of myocardial strain. Furthermore, cardiac biomarkers can possibly be used to guide therapy and improve outcome. Natriuretic peptides and cardiac troponins are potential tools in the diagnosis and treatment of neonatal disease that is complicated by circulatory compromise. However, clear reference ranges need to be set and validation needs to be carried out in a population of interest.","Vijlbrief, Daniel C; Benders, Manon J N L; Kemperman, Hans; van Bel, Frank; de Vries, Willem B",Pediatric research,https://doi.org/10.1038/pr.2012.88; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22797141/,134
65830,Minimally invasive liver surgery in a hepato-biliary unit: learning curve and indications.,2015,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW Whereas angiotensin-converting enzyme promotes the formation of angiotensin II, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 promotes the degradation of angiotensin II to angiotensin-(1-7). We review recent studies dealing with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 in kidney disease and hypertension, and discuss the potential therapeutic benefit of increasing angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 activity in the treatment of these diseases. RECENT FINDINGS In glomeruli from diabetic mice, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 expression is downregulated, and pharmacological inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 leads to worsening of albuminuria, increased mesangial matrix deposition and fibronectin expression. The deletion of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 gene in mice leads to worsening of angiotensin II-induced hypertension and has also been shown to cause glomerulosclerosis in aging male mice. SUMMARY Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a key enzyme in the renin-angiotensin system that favors the degradation of angiotensin I and angiotensin II. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 inhibition by pharmacological means and by genetic deletion worsens kidney disease in diabetic mice. Strategies geared to increasing angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 activity may provide a novel therapeutic target within the renin-angiotensin system by enhancing angiotensin II degradation that may complement the current approach of inhibiting angiotensin II formation and action. Amplifying angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 activity may have a potential therapeutic role for kidney disease and hypertension.","Batlle, Daniel; Soler, María José; Wysocki, Jan",Current opinion in nephrology and hypertension,https://doi.org/10.1097/mnh.0b013e3282f945c2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18408475/,134

Recent national surveys in the United States and Australia have highlighted the need for enhanced home dialysis knowledge especially among nephrologists who have recently completed training. Traditional in-person continuing professional educational programs have had modest success in promoting home dialysis and are limited by scale and the present global COVID-19 pandemic.

Preliminary studies have suggested that MST leads to fewer cognitive adverse effects than electroconvulsive therapy but has similar efficacy. However, the clinical predictors of response to MST have not been evaluated yet. This study aimed to investigate whether these predictors can be identified in patients with TRD. METHODS Thirty-eight patients with TRD were included. As clinical predictors for treatment response, we used the diagnosis, sex, age, family history, and severity of depression, as well as the melancholic, psychotic, anxiety, and atypical depression symptoms. A response was defined as an improvement higher than 50% on the 28-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression. The binary logistic regression, stepwise linear regression, and effect sizes were calculated. RESULTS We found that 68.4% of the patients responded to MST. The responders had significantly fewer previous depressive episodes, less severe depression, and fewer melancholic (anhedonia) and anxiety symptoms than the nonresponders. In addition, responders were more likely to have a positive family history of depression than nonresponders. In particular, the number of previous episodes and a family history of depression were significant predictors of the response to MST. CONCLUSIONS We demonstrate that the chronicity, severity, and family history of depression, as well as the presence of melancholic and anxiety symptoms, can serve as clinical predictors of the response to MST. Further research with a larger sample size will be required to verify these preliminary findings.","Kayser, Sarah; Bewernick, Bettina H; Wagner, Stefanie; Schlaepfer, Thomas E",The journal of ECT,https://doi.org/10.1097/yct.0000000000000495; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29613946/,134

Diagnostic autopsy, although useful for cause of death identification, have limited acceptance. Minimally invasive tissue sampling (MITS) is an alternative to autopsy for identification of the cause of death (CoD). A formative research linked to pilot MITS implementation was conducted to document the perceptions and attitudes of the healthcare professionals and the barriers for implementation. METHODS This exploratory qualitative study conducted at a tertiary care hospital in New Delhi, India included the hospital staffs. In-depth interviews were conducted with the doctors, nurses and support staffs from pediatrics, neonatology, obstetrics and forensic medicine departments. Inductive data analysis was done to identify the emerging themes and codes. RESULTS A total of 26 interviews (doctors, n = 10; nurses, n = 9 and support staffs, n = 7) were conducted. Almost all professional and support staffs were positive about the MITS and its advantage for CoD identification including co-existing and underlying illnesses. Some opined conduct of MITS for the cases without clear diagnosis. All participants perceived that MITS would be acceptable for parents due to the non-disfigurement and preferred by those who had unexplained child deaths or stillbirths in past. The key factors for MITS acceptance were appropriate communication, trust building, involvement of senior doctors, and engagement of the counselor prior to deaths and training of the personnel. For implementation and sustenance of MITS, involvement of the institute authority and government stakeholders would be essential. CONCLUSIONS MITS was acceptable for the doctors, nurses and support staffs and critical for better identification of the causes of death and stillbirths. The key facilitating factors and challenges for implementing MITS at the hospital in Indian context were identified. It emphasized on appropriate skill building, counseling, system organization and buy-in from institution and health authorities for sustenance of MITS.","Das, Manoja Kumar; Arora, Narendra Kumar; Rasaily, Reeta; Kaur, Gurkirat; Malik, Prikanksha; Kumari, Mahisha; Joshi, Shipra; Chellani, Harish; Gaekwad, Harsha; Debata, Pradeep; Meena, K R",BMC health services research,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-020-05693-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32887603/,134

Although pregnant women are considered at risk for respiratory infections by other viruses, such as SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), little is known about their vulnerability to SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, this study aims to identify and present the main studies on the topic, including the postpartum period. METHODS In this narrative review, articles were searched in various databases, organizations, and health entities using keywords compatible with medical subject headings (MeSH), such as: COVID-19, pregnancy, vertical transmission, coronavirus 2019, and SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS The review of the scientific literature on the subject revealed that pregnant women with COVID-19 did not present clinical manifestations significantly different from those of non-pregnant women; however, there are contraindicated therapies. Regarding fetuses, studies were identified that reported that infection by SARS-CoV-2 in pregnant women can cause fetal distress, breathing difficulties and premature birth, but there is no substantial evidence of vertical transmission. CONCLUSION Due to the lack of adequate information and the limitations of the analyzed studies, it is necessary to provide detailed clinical data on pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 and on the maternal-fetal repercussions caused by this infection. Thus, this review may contribute to expand the knowledge of professionals working in the area as well as to guide more advanced studies on the risk related to pregnant women and their newborns. Meanwhile, monitoring of confirmed or suspected pregnant women with COVID-19 is essential, including in the postpartum period.","Godoi, Ana Paula Nogueira; Bernardes, Gilcelia Correia Santos; Nogueira, Leilismara Sousa; Alpoim, Patrícia Nessralla; Pinheiro, Melina de Barros",Revista brasileira de ginecologia e obstetricia : revista da Federacao Brasileira das Sociedades de Ginecologia e Obstetricia,https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0041-1729145; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34182583/,134
68153,Safety and efficacy of robotic-assisted groin hernia repair.,2020-08-10,"Coal fly ash (FA) supported Pd-Ag bimetallic nanoparticles (FA-Pd-Ag) were prepared by reducing Pd(II) and Ag(I) salts together onto the dispersed solid support in aqueous medium. Electron microscope analysis (FE-SEM, HRTEM) in combination with elemental mapping (EDS) suggests that the nanoparticles are well dispersed on fly ash with an average diameter of 6-8 nm. The powder XRD analysis indicates that alloying of the interface occurs between Pd and Ag nanoparticles in FA-Pd-Ag, while XPS reveals that charge transfer takes place between the Pd and Ag moieties that come into contact with each other. The FA-Pd-Ag in aqueous NaBH4 solution exhibits an efficient catalytic reduction of 4-nitrophenol into 4-aminophenol and follows pseudo-first-order reaction kinetics (kPd-Ag = 0.7176 min-1). The higher rate constant for FA-Pd-Ag compared to that for their monometallic analogues (FA-Pd (kPd = 0.5449 min-1)) and (FA-Ag (kAg = 0.5572 min-1)) as well as their physical mixture ((FA-Pd + FA-Ag) (kPd+Ag = 0.4075 min-1)) suggests the synergistic catalytic effect of the bimetallic system. Moreover, the present bimetallic nanocatalyst exhibits the highest normalized rate constant (KPd-Ag ≈ 51 100 min-1 mmol-1) compared to the reported bimetallic Pd-Ag nanocatalysts.","Maity, Niladri; Sahoo, Anupam; Boddhula, Rajkumar; Chatterjee, Saurav; Patra, Srikanta; Panda, Binod Bihari",Dalton transactions,https://doi.org/10.1039/d0dt01899f; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32734989/,134

The anti-retroviral therapy failure rate and the risk of HIV vertical transmission to infants from women with failed treatment during pregnancy also largely remains unevaluated. METHODS This is a prospective, observational and follow-up study of 18 months to determine the association of ART failure in pregnant women and the subsequent risk of HIV transmission to their infants. A total of 81 mothers were evaluated for ART success/failure by analysing their viral loads. RESULTS Analyses revealed that a high percentage (19.75%) of women on ART had high viral loads, while the overall HIV transmission rate to the infants was 8.64%. The rate of transmission from women with high viral load was significantly high compared to women with low viral load (37.5% vs. 1.54%; p = 0.0015). CD4 level was not associated with HIV transmission. However, CD4 levels in women, who had successful or failed ART, were significantly different (p = 0.0031). Factors such as mother's age, baby's sex and weight as well as delivery mode were not associated with HIV transmission, however, breastfeeding and viral loads were found to be independently associated with HIV transmission to the neonates. CONCLUSIONS This study highlights that a significant proportion of women on ART had impaired viral load control. The rate of HIV transmission to infants was also significantly high among these women. This warrants viral load monitoring of HIV infected women to reduce the overall transmission to the infants.","Bardeskar, Nikhil S; Ahir-Bist, Swati P; Mehta, Preeti R; Samant-Mavani, Padmaja; Nanavati, Ruchi; Mania-Pramanik, Jayanti",Archives of gynecology and obstetrics,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00404-020-05743-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32803392/,134

69114,Time to stop mink farming in the EU.,2020-12-19,"The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is invaluable for understanding fundamental cellular processes and disease states of relevance to higher eukaryotes. Plant viruses are intracellular parasites that take advantage of resources of the host cell, and a simple eukaryotic cell, such as yeast, can provide all or most of the functions for successful plant virus replication. Thus, yeast has been used as a model to unravel the interactions of plant viruses with their hosts. Indeed, genome-wide and proteomics studies using yeast as a model host with bromoviruses and tombusviruses have facilitated the identification of replication-associated factors that affect host-virus interactions, virus pathology, virus evolution, and host range. Many of the host genes that affect the replication of the two viruses, which belong to two dissimilar virus families, are distinct, suggesting that plant viruses have developed different ways to utilize the resources of host cells. In addition, a surprisingly large number of yeast genes have been shown to affect RNA-RNA recombination in tombusviruses; this opens an opportunity to study the role of the host in virus evolution. The knowledge gained about host-virus interactions likely will lead to the development of new antiviral methods and applications in biotechnology and nanotechnology, as well as new insights into cellular functions of individual genes and the basic biology of the host cell.","Nagy, Peter D",Annual review of phytopathology,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.phyto.121407.093958; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18422427/,134
69597,Deciphering the Association Between Hypothalamus-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis Activity and Obesity: A Meta-Analysis.,2021-03-29,"Context Early diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and patient isolation are important for both individual patient care and disease containment. The diagnosis is confirmed by testing for the presence of nasopharyngeal viral RNA with a polymerase chain reaction assay, which has limited availability, variable turnaround time, and a high false-negative rate. The authors report that a rapid laboratory test, the eosinophil count, readily obtained from a routine complete blood cell count (CBC), may provide actionable clinical information to aid in the early recognition of COVID-19 in patients, as well as provide prognostic information. Objective To investigate the diagnostic and prognostic value of eosinopenia in COVID-19-positive patients. Methods The eosinophil results of routine CBC from the first 50 admitted COVID-19-positive patients were compared with the eosinophil results of 50 patients with confirmed influenza infection at the time of presentation to the emergency department at Coney Island Hospital in Brooklyn, New York. The number of patients with 0 eosinophils on the day of presentation was also compared between the 2 groups. Furthermore, the eosinophil counts in the 50 COVID-19 patients were reviewed for the first 5 days of their hospital stay and before discharge, along with the outcome (deceased vs discharged), and trends in eosinophil data were compared based on the outcome. Results On the day of presentation, 30 patients in the COVID-19 group (60%) and 8 patients in the influenza group (16%) had an eosinophil count of 0. An additional 14 patients in the COVID-19 group had 0 eosinophils during the following 2 days; the total number of patients in the COVID-19 group who had 0 eosinophils on admission or during the ensuing 2 days was 44 (88%). In addition, 18 of 21 deceased patients in the COVID-19 group (86%) who initially presented with eosinopenia remained eosinopenic compared with 13 of 26 survivors (50%). Conclusion The absence of an eosinophil count in a CBC can aid in early diagnosis of COVID-19. It may be a useful tool in deciding whether to promptly isolate a patient and initiate specific therapies while waiting for confirmatory test results. Persistent eosinopenia after admission correlated with high disease severity and low rates of recovery.","Tanni, Fahmina; Akker, Eleonora; Zaman, Muhammad M; Figueroa, Nilka; Tharian, Biju; Hupart, Kenneth H",The Journal of the American Osteopathic Association,https://doi.org/10.7556/jaoa.2020.091; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32672799/,134

METHOD This research employs the advantages of computer vision and medical image analysis to develop an automated model that has the clinical potential for early detection of the disease. Using Deep Learning models, the research aims at evaluating the effectiveness and accuracy of different convolutional neural networks models in the automatic diagnosis of COVID-19 from X-ray images as compared to diagnosis performed by experts in the medical community. RESULT Due to the fact that the dataset available for COVID-19 is still limited, the best model to use is the InceptionNetV3. Performance results show that the InceptionNetV3 model yielded the highest accuracy of 98.63% (with data augmentation) and 98.90% (without data augmentation) among the three models designed. However, as the dataset gets bigger, the Inception ResNetV2 and NASNetlarge will do a better job of classification. All the performed networks tend to over-fit when data augmentation is not used, this is due to the small amount of data used for training and validation. CONCLUSION A deep transfer learning is proposed to detecting the COVID-19 automatically from chest X-ray by training it with X-ray images gotten from both COVID-19 patients and people with normal chest Xrays. The study is aimed at helping doctors in making decisions in their clinical practice due its high performance and effectiveness, the study also gives an insight to how transfer learning was used to automatically detect the COVID-19.","Albahli, Saleh; Albattah, Waleed",Current medical imaging,https://doi.org/10.2174/1573405616666201123120417; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33231160/,134

At present, conflicting data exists regarding patient safety for ambulatory (AMB) metabolic and bariatric surgery. OBJECTIVE Outcomes for AMB-metabolic and bariatric surgery patients (LoS <1 d) undergoing laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) or sleeve gastrectomy (SG) were compared with matched patients with LoS ≥1 day (non-AMB) using the Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality Improvement Program (MBSAQIP) registry. SETTING MBSAQIP national database. METHODS The MBSAQIP registry was queried for patients undergoing SG or RYGB (2015-2017) and patients grouped as AMB/non-AMB. Exclusion criteria included LoS >4 days, age <18 or >75 years, revision surgery, gastric banding, body mass index <35 kg/m2, and day of surgery mortality. Variables were combined into major/minor complications and 30-day mortality. Analysis was performed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression and propensity matching. RESULTS After exclusions were applied 408,895 patients remained (9973 AMB). Overall, 111,279 patients underwent RYGB (1032 AMB) and 297,616 underwent SG (8941 AMB), with similar demographic characteristics and co-morbidities between groups. For AMB patients, there was no increase in 30-day mortality, reoperation, or readmission, and fewer drains were placed versus matched non-AMB patients. In AMB-SG patients more surgical site infections were reported versus non-AMB-SG, although AMB-SG patients had fewer intensive care unit admissions. For AMB-RYGB, no differences in complications were detected versus non-AMB-RYGB. CONCLUSION Based on our analysis of the MBSAQIP database, patients undergoing laparoscopic RYGB or SG procedures can be safely discharged on the day of their procedure without increased incidence of mortality, reoperation, or readmission.","Barbat, Selwan; Thompson, Kyle J; Mckillop, Iain H; Kuwada, Timothy S; Gersin, Keith; Nimeri, Abdelrahman",Surgery for obesity and related diseases : official journal of the American Society for Bariatric Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.soard.2020.06.051; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32830058/,134

Here, we constructed 4 candidate vaccines by fusing H5N1 hemagglutinin 1 (HA1) with foldon (HA1-Fd), human IgG Fc (HA1-Fc), foldon and Fc (HA1-FdFc) or His-tag (HA1-His). We then compared their ability to induce mucosal immune responses and neutralizing antibodies in the presence or absence of Poly(I:C) and CpG adjuvants via the intranasal route. Without an adjuvant, HA1-FdFc could elicit appreciable humoral immune responses and local mucosal IgA antibodies in immunized mice, while other vaccine candidates only induced background immune responses. In the presence of Poly(I:C) and CpG, both HA1-Fd and HA1-Fc elicited much higher levels of serum IgG and local mucosal IgA antibodies than HA1-His. Poly(I:C) and CpG could also augment the neutralizing antibody responses induced by these 4 vaccine candidates in the order of HA1-FdFc > HA1-Fc > HA1-Fd > HA1-His. These results suggest that both Fd and Fc potentiate the immunogenicity of the recombinant HA1 protein and that Poly(I:C) and CpG serve as efficient mucosal adjuvants in promoting efficacy of these vaccine candidates to induce strong systemic and local antibody responses and potent neutralizing antibodies, providing a useful strategy to develop effective and safe mucosal H5N1 vaccines.","Yu, Fei; Li, Ye; Guo, Yan; Wang, Lili; Yang, Jie; Zhao, Guangyu; Zhou, Yusen; Du, Lanying; Jiang, Shibo",Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,https://doi.org/10.1080/21645515.2015.1074363; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26260706/,134
70505,Future proofing veterinary education.,2020-08-22,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE The type and composition of an embolic agent have a relevant influence on the performance of endovascular embolization. The aim of this study was to investigate a new version of the liquid embolic agent precipitating hydrophobic injectable liquid (PHIL) with extra-low-viscosity in an in vivo embolization model. MATERIALS AND METHODS Twenty-four embolization procedures were performed in the porcine rete mirabile. Eight embolizations were performed with PHIL 25% low viscosity, Squid 12, and standard PHIL 25%, respectively. Procedure time, required volume of embolic agent, visibility of the embolic agent, embolization control, embolization extent (ie, penetration of the rete mirabile), amount of reflux, and degree of embolization distal to the rete mirabile were assessed. RESULTS All embolic agents were adequately visible. The embolization extent was not significantly different among the 3 investigated agents; however, there was a tendency toward a higher embolization extent for PHIL 25% low viscosity (median embolization extent: 88% [PHIL 25% low viscosity]; 65% [Squid 12]; 60% [PHIL 25%]; P = .146). The amount of reflux was significantly lower for the extra-low-viscosity agents PHIL 25% low viscosity and Squid 12 compared with the standard PHIL 25% (median reflux distance: 8 mm [PHIL 25% low viscosity]; 6 mm [Squid 12]; 17 mm [PHIL 25%]; P = .011). All other embolization features did not differ among agents. CONCLUSIONS PHIL 25% low viscosity is a promising liquid embolic agent for endovascular embolization, featuring effective distal penetration, adequate visibility, a low amount of reflux, and good flow control.","Vollherbst, D F; Otto, R; Hantz, M; Ulfert, C; Kauczor, H U; Bendszus, M; Sommer, C M; Möhlenbruch, M A",AJNR.

OBJECTIVE Establishing the kinetics of isothermal extraction of total hypericin (TH) from the pre-extracted flowers of H. perforatum flowers. METHODS The solvent extraction of TH from the remaining solid residue after the pre-extraction procedure was performed providing isothermal conditions at the temperature of 313 K, 323 K, and 328 K (±1 K) using ethanol as a solvent. The feasibility of mathematical modelling of the isothermal kinetics of TH extraction was explored applying some of the frequently used kinetic models of solvent extraction: first-order reaction model, film theory model, unsteady-state diffusion model, parabolic diffusion model, Elovich's equation. The kinetic complexity was examined using the differential isoconversional method. RESULTS The kinetics of isothermal solvent extraction of TH is a kinetic elementary process with the unique rate-determining step. It was found that the kinetics of isothermal extraction of TH can be best described employing the theoretical Jander three-dimensional (3D) diffusional model and its suitability for modelling the investigated extraction was confirmed with statistical parameters [adjusted linear correlation coefficient (R2 adj ) = 0.998-0.999 and the standard error (SE) = 0.005-0.006]. The values of the model kinetic parameters (rate constant (kM /min-1 ), activation energy (Ea = 21.0 ± 4.9 kJ/mol) and pre-exponential factor (lnA = 3.1 ± 2.2 min-1 ) were calculated.

However, the cellular mechanisms of tGVHD and interactions between donor alloreactive T cells and thymic tissues remain poorly defined. Using clinically relevant murine allo-BMT models, we show here that even minimal numbers of donor alloreactive T cells, which caused mild nonlethal systemic graft-versus-host disease, were sufficient to damage the thymus, delay T lineage reconstitution, and compromise donor peripheral T cell function. Furthermore, to mediate tGVHD, donor alloreactive T cells required trafficking molecules, including CCR9, L selectin, P selectin glycoprotein ligand-1, the integrin subunits alphaE and beta7, CCR2, and CXCR3, and costimulatory/inhibitory molecules, including Ox40 and carcinoembryonic antigen-associated cell adhesion molecule 1. We found that radiation in BMT conditioning regimens upregulated expression of the death receptors Fas and death receptor 5 (DR5) on thymic stromal cells (especially epithelium), while decreasing expression of the antiapoptotic regulator cellular caspase-8-like inhibitory protein. Donor alloreactive T cells used the cognate proteins FasL and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) (but not TNF or perforin) to mediate tGVHD, thereby damaging thymic stromal cells, cytoarchitecture, and function. Strategies that interfere with Fas/FasL and TRAIL/DR5 interactions may therefore represent a means to attenuate tGVHD and improve T cell reconstitution in allo-BMT recipients.","Na, Il-Kang; Lu, Sydney X; Yim, Nury L; Goldberg, Gabrielle L; Tsai, Jennifer; Rao, Uttam; Smith, Odette M; King, Christopher G; Suh, David; Hirschhorn-Cymerman, Daniel; Palomba, Lia; Penack, Olaf; Holland, Amanda M; Jenq, Robert R; Ghosh, Arnab; Tran, Hien; Merghoub, Taha; Liu, Chen; Sempowski, Gregory D; Ventevogel, Melissa; Beauchemin, Nicole; van den Brink, Marcel R M",The Journal of clinical investigation,https://doi.org/10.1172/jci39395; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19955659/,134

The early detection of emerging human, animal, and plant diseases is critical to preventing the spread of infection and protecting the health of our species and environment. Today, more than 75% of emerging infectious diseases are estimated to be zoonotic and capable of crossing species barriers and diminishing food supplies. Traditionally, surveillance of diseases has relied on a hierarchy of health professionals that can be costly to build and maintain, leading to a delay or interruption in reporting. However, Internet-based surveillance systems bring another dimension to epidemiology by utilizing technology to collect, organize, and disseminate information in a more timely manner. Partially and fully automated systems allow for earlier detection of disease outbreaks by searching for information from both formal sources (e.g., World Health Organization and government ministry reports) and informal sources (e.g., blogs, online media sources, and social networks). Web-based applications display disparate information online or disperse it through e-mail to subscribers or the general public. Web-based early warning systems, such as ProMED-mail, the Global Public Health Intelligence Network (GPHIN), and Health Map, have been able to recognize emerging infectious diseases earlier than traditional surveillance systems.

Reperfusion may cause blood-brain barrier disruption and a risk for cerebral edema and secondary parenchymal hemorrhage (PH). We aimed to investigate the effect of recanalization on development of early CED and PH after recanalization therapy. Methods- From the SITS-International Stroke Treatment Registry, we selected patients with signs of artery occlusion at baseline (either Hyperdense Artery Sign or computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging angiographic occlusion). We defined recanalization as the disappearance of radiological signs of occlusion at 22 to 36 hours. Primary outcome was moderate to severe CED and secondary outcome was PH on 22- to 36-hour imaging scans. We used logistic regression with adjustment for baseline variables and PH. Results- Twenty two thousand one hundred eighty-four patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria (n=18 318 received intravenous thrombolysis, n=3071 received intravenous thrombolysis+thrombectomy, n=795 received thrombectomy). Recanalization occurred in 64.1%. Median age was 71 versus 71 years and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score 15 versus 16 in the recanalized versus nonrecanalized patients respectively. Recanalized patients had a lower risk for CED (13.0% versus 23.6%), adjusted odds ratio (aOR), 0.52 (95% CI, 0.46-0.59), and a higher risk for PH (8.9% versus 6.5%), adjusted odds ratio, 1.37 (95% CI, 1.22-1.55), than nonrecanalized patients. Conclusions- In patients with acute ischemic stroke, recanalization was associated with a lower risk for early CED even after adjustment for higher rate for PH in recanalized patients.","Thorén, Magnus; Dixit, Anand; Escudero-Martínez, Irene; Gdovinová, Zuzana; Klecka, Lukas; Rand, Viiu-Marika; Toni, Danilo; Vilionskis, Aleksandras; Wahlgren, Nils; Ahmed, Niaz",Stroke,https://doi.org/10.1161/strokeaha.119.026692; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31818228/,134

72254,Training for laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS).,2010,"The international scope of the Mediterranean wine trade in Late Antiquity raises important questions concerning sustainability in an ancient international economy and offers a valuable historical precedent to modern globalization. Such questions involve the role of intercontinental commerce in maintaining sustainable production within important supply regions and the vulnerability of peripheral regions believed to have been especially sensitive to environmental and political disturbances. We provide archaeobotanical evidence from trash mounds at three sites in the central Negev Desert, Israel, unraveling the rise and fall of viticulture over the second to eighth centuries of the common era (CE). Using quantitative ceramic data obtained in the same archaeological contexts, we further investigate connections between Negev viticulture and circum-Mediterranean trade. Our findings demonstrate interrelated growth in viticulture and involvement in Mediterranean trade reaching what appears to be a commercial scale in the fourth to mid-sixth centuries. Following a mid-sixth century peak, decline of this system is evident in the mid- to late sixth century, nearly a century before the Islamic conquest. These findings closely correspond with other archaeological evidence for social, economic, and urban growth in the fourth century and decline centered on the mid-sixth century. Contracting markets were a likely proximate cause for the decline; possible triggers include climate change, plague, and wider sociopolitical developments. In long-term historical perspective, the unprecedented commercial florescence of the Late Antique Negev appears to have been unsustainable, reverting to an age-old pattern of smaller-scale settlement and survival-subsistence strategies within a time frame of about two centuries.","Fuks, Daniel; Bar-Oz, Guy; Tepper, Yotam; Erickson-Gini, Tali; Langgut, Dafna; Weissbrod, Lior; Weiss, Ehud",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1922200117; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32719145/,134
72339,Total Laparoscopic versus Vaginal Hysterectomy: The experience of a Training Hospital.,2016,"QUESTION The context for the implementation of evidence-based psychological treatments (EBPTs) often differs from the context in which the treatment was developed, which necessitates adaptations. In this systematic review we build on, and add to, prior approaches by examining the method used to guide such adaptations. In particular, we sought to elucidate the extent to which an empirical process is used. STUDY SELECTION AND ANALYSIS We focused on publications describing adaptations made to EBPTs for adults diagnosed with a mental illness. We searched PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase and Web of Science from database inception to July 2018. Two raters independently coded the articles for the method used to conduct the adaptation, the reason for and nature of the adaptation, and who made the adaptation. FINDINGS The search produced 20 194 citations, which yielded 152 articles after screening. The most commonly used methods for planned adaptations were literature review (57.7%), clinical intuition (47.0%) and theory (38.9%). The use of data from stakeholder interviews ranked fourth (21.5%) and the use of other types of data (eg, pilot study, experiment, survey, interview) ranked last at fifth (12.1%). Few publications reporting ad hoc adaptations were identified (n=3). CONCLUSIONS This review highlights a need to (a) educate providers and researchers to carefully consider the methods used for the treatment adaptation process, and to use empirical methods where possible and where appropriate, (b) improve the quality of reporting of stakeholder interviews and (c) develop reporting standards that articulate optimal methods for conducting treatment adaptations.","Harvey, Allison G; Lammers, Hannah S; Dolsen, Michael R; Mullin, Alice C; Hilmoe, Heather E; Tran, Melanie; Portnova, Vera; Tuck, Alison B; Mallidi, Ajitha; Fang, Anya; Byrnes, Caitlin; Kao, Esther; Lee, Colin",Evidence-based mental health,https://doi.org/10.1136/ebmental-2020-300225; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33355291/,134

Rhytidectomy offers a great opportunity to surgically enhance the aging earlobe. The objective of this study was to provide a step-by-step description of the execution of the three-triangle rotation flap technique for aesthetic ear lobule reduction. METHODS The three-triangle rotation flap technique is described in a step-by-step fashion and illustrated by photographs and videos. All ear lobule reduction procedures that took place at our practice from December 2016 to February 2020 were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS A total of 16 patients underwent bilateral ear lobule reduction during face lift, neck lift, or both, and 7 patients underwent bilateral lobule reduction in isolation. None of the patients experienced complications, and revisions were not performed or required. CONCLUSIONS The three-triangle rotation flap technique relies on simple principles that can be adjusted to address all shapes and degrees of true ear lobule ptosis, as well as patient desire. It is employed in isolation or synchronous with rhytidectomy. When performed during rhytidectomy, it provides lobule stability and fixation.

The pattern of a metabolism-related signature in melanoma remains unknown. Here, we explored the role of a multi-metabolism-related gene signature in melanoma.We used the training and validation sets to develop a multi-metabolism-related gene signature. Cox regression analysis and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method were used for constructing a model. The predictive role of the metabolic signature with clinicopathological features of melanoma was also analyzed. Functional analysis of this metabolic signature was also investigated.A ten metabolism-related gene signature was identified and can stratify melanoma into high- and low- risk groups. The signature was correlated with progressive T stage, Breslow thickness, Clark level, and worse survival (all Ps< 0.01). This metabolic signature was shown as an independent prognostic factor and was also a predictive indicator for worse survival in various clinical and molecular features of melanoma. Furthermore, the metabolic signature was implicated in immune responses such as the regulation of T cell activation and cytokine activity. The metabolic signaturewas associated with the progression and worse survival of melanoma. Our study offered a valuable metabolism-targeted therapy approach for melanoma.","Wan, Mengdi; Zhuang, Binyu; Dai, Xiao; Zhang, Liang; Zhao, Fangqing; You, Yan",Bioengineered,https://doi.org/10.1080/21655979.2020.1822714; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33084485/,134
73539,Comparing Single and Dual Console Systems in the Robotic Surgical Training of Graduating OB/GYN Residents in the United States.,2016,"INTRODUCTION Clinical ultrasound is a technique that increases diagnostic capacity and facilitates clinical decision making. The objective is to develop and validate an ultrasound training methodology oriented to the clinical practice of the family physician. METHODS Quasi-experimental study, with a before/after design, a control group, and 1 year of follow-up. Twenty family physicians working in primary care health centers with a list of over 800 patients will be included, as well as a control group of family physicians with similar characteristics in terms of age, sex, and patient list. A structured training process oriented to the clinical practice of the family physician, primary care clinical ultrasound classroom (AECAP), will be carried out, and the improvement of knowledge and skills of the participants will be evaluated, as well as the improvement of the quality of care based on clinical indicators. DISCUSSION The family physician is in a privileged situation allows increasing the performance of ultrasound in frequent clinical situations and reducing care hours. We hope that the results obtained in this study demonstrate the effectiveness of the structured training method (AECAP) and support the generalization of ultrasound in primary health care.

73557,Prospective randomized trial of barbed polyglyconate suture to facilitate vesico-urethral anastomosis during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: time reduction and cost benefit.,2012,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS Several criteria have been described to noninvasively predict the presence of high-risk esophageal varices in patients with compensated advanced chronic liver disease (cACLD). However, a recent study showed that treatment with β blockers could increase decompensation-free survival in patients with clinically significant portal hypertension, thereby making it important to predict the presence of any esophageal varices. We aimed to develop a simple scoring system to predict any esophageal varices. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed patients who had vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE) at Cook County Hospital, Chicago, USA. Patients with cACLD and liver stiffness measurement (LSM) ≥ 10 kPa with esophagogastroduodenoscopy performed within one year of VCTE were analyzed. We generated a novel score to predict esophageal varices, using the beta coefficient of predictive variables. The score was validated in an external cohort at the University of Iowa Hospital, USA. RESULTS There were 372 patients in the development cohort and 200 patients in the validation cohort. LSM, platelet count, and albumin were identified as predictors of esophageal varices and were included for generating the Cook County score as ""platelet count * - 0.0155872 + VCTE score * 0.0387052 + albumin * - 0.8549209."" The area under receiver operating curve for our score was 0.86 for any varices and 0.85 for high risk varices and avoided more endoscopies than the expanded Baveno VI criteria while maintaining a very low miss rate (negative predictive value > 99%). CONCLUSION We propose a new, highly accurate, and easy-to-use scoring system to predict the presence of not only high-risk but any esophageal varices in patients with cACLD.","Kotwal, Vikram; Mbachi, Chimezie; Wang, Yuchen; Attar, Bashar; Randhawa, Tejinder; Flores, Estefania; Robles, Julian; Rosenstengle, Craig; Demetria, Melchor; Adeyemi, Oluwatoyin; Huhn, Gregory; Murali, Arvind R",Digestive diseases and sciences,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10620-020-06456-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32648078/,134
73576,Using virtual reality to maintain surgical skills during periods of robotic surgery inactivity.,2014,"ABSTRACT A substantial evidence-practice gap exists between healthcare professionals learning about the biopsychosocial model of pain and adopting this model in clinical practice. This review aimed to explore the barriers and enablers that influence the application of a biopsychosocial approach to musculoskeletal pain in practice, from the clinicians' perspective. Qualitative evidence synthesis was used. Four electronic databases (CINAHL, EMBASE. MEDLINE, PsycINFO) were searched. Primary qualitative studies were included if they investigated the experiences of primary healthcare professionals using a biopsychosocial model of musculoskeletal pain care in outpatient settings, or their perceptions towards biopsychosocial-oriented clinical practice guidelines. After screening 6571 abstracts, 77 full text articles were retrieved. Twenty-five studies met the eligibility criteria, reporting the experiences of 413 healthcare professionals (including general practitioners, physiotherapists and others) spanning 11 countries. Three metathemes were identified that impact the adoption of the biopsychosocial model across the whole-of-health: (1) at the micro-level, healthcare professionals' personal factors, knowledge and skills, and their misconceptions of clinical practice guidelines, perception of patients' factors and time; (2) at the meso-level, clinical practice guideline formulation, community factors, funding models, health service provision, resourcing issues and workforce training issues; and (3) at the macro-level, health policy, organizational and social factors. Synthesized data revealed multi-level (whole-of-health) barriers and enablers to health professionals adopting a biopsychosocial model of pain into practice. Awareness of these multi-level factors may help inform pre-implementation preparedness and support more effective implementation of the biopsychosocial model of musculoskeletal pain into clinical practice.","Ng, Wendy; Slater, Helen; Starcevich, Cobie; Wright, Anthony; Mitchell, Tim; Beales, Darren",Pain,https://doi.org/10.1097/j.pain.0000000000002217; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33534357/,134
73695,"The first 100 consecutive, robot-assisted, intracorporeal ileal conduits: evolution of technique and 90-day outcomes.",2013,"Treatment with icosapent ethyl 4 g/day, a highly purified and stable ethyl ester of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), demonstrated a significant reduction in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events and death in REDUCE-IT. However, analyses of REDUCE-IT and meta-analyses have suggested that this clinical benefit is greater than can be achieved by triglyceride reduction alone. EPA therefore may have additional pleiotropic effects, including anti-inflammatory and anti-aggregatory mechanisms. EPA competes with arachidonic acid for cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase, producing anti-inflammatory and anti-aggregatory metabolites rather than the more deleterious metabolites associated with arachidonic acid. Changing the EPA: arachidonic acid ratio may shift metabolic status from pro-inflammatory/pro-aggregatory to anti-inflammatory/anti-aggregatory. EPA also has antioxidant effects and increases synthesis of nitric oxide. Incorporation of EPA into phospholipid bilayers influences membrane structure and may help to prevent cardiac arrhythmias. Clinically, this may translate into improved vascular health, including regression of atherosclerotic plaque. Overall, EPA has a range of pleiotropic effects that contribute to a reduction in ASCVD.","Nelson, John R; Budoff, Matthew J; Wani, Omar R; Le, Viet; Patel, Dhiren K; Nelson, Ashley; Nemiroff, Richard L",Postgraduate medicine,https://doi.org/10.1080/00325481.2021.1921491; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33900135/,134
73963,Procedure-related morbidity in bariatric surgery: a retrospective short- and mid-term follow-up of a single institution of the American College of Surgeons Bariatric Surgery Centers of Excellence.,2013,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Treatment in stroke patients with M2 segment occlusion of the middle cerebral artery presenting with mild neurological deficits is a matter of debate. The main purpose was to compare the outcome in patients with a minor stroke and a M2 occlusion. METHODS Consecutive intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) eligible patients admitted to the Bernese stroke center between January 2005 and January 2020 with acute occlusion of the M2 segment and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score ≤5 were included. Outcome was compared between IVT only versus endovascular therapy (EVT) including intra-arterial thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy (MT; ±IVT) and between IVT only versus MT only. RESULTS Among 169 patients (38.5% women, median age 70.2 years), 84 (49.7%) received IVT only and 85 (50.3%) EVT (±IVT), the latter including 39 (45.9%) treated with MT only. Groups were similar in sex, age, vascular risk factors, event cause, or preevent independency. Compared with IVT only, there was no difference in favorable outcome (modified Rankin Scale score, 0-2) for EVT (adjusted odds ratio, 0.96; adjusted P=0.935) or for MT only (adjusted odds ratio, 1.12; adjusted P=0.547) groups. Considering only patients treated after 2015, there was a significantly better 3-month modified Rankin Scale shift (adjusted P=0.032) in the EVT compared with the IVT only group. CONCLUSIONS Our study demonstrates similar effectiveness of IVT only versus EVT (±IVT), and of IVT only versus MT only in patients with peripheral middle cerebral artery occlusions and minor neurological deficits and indicates a possible benefit of EVT considering only patients treated after 2015. There is an unmet need for randomized controlled trials in this stroke field, including imaging parameters, and more sophisticated evaluation of National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score subitems, neurocognition, and quality of life neglected by the standard outcome scales such as modified Rankin Scale and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score.","Dobrocky, Tomas; Piechowiak, Eike I; Volbers, Bastian; Slavova, Nedelina; Kaesmacher, Johannes; Meinel, Thomas R; Arnold, Marcel; Fischer, Urs; Jung, Simon; Gralla, Jan; Mordasini, Pasquale; Heldner, Mirjam R",Stroke,https://doi.org/10.1161/strokeaha.120.031672; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33494637/,134

73990,Meeting the challenge of disease threats to the U.K.,2015,"BACKGROUND As high stigmatization of HIV and relatively low knowledge of HIV transmission and prevention measures persist in Sub-Saharan Africa, the improvement of HIV-related knowledge, and the evaluation of which types of interventions are most effective in this regard, is an important aspect of further prevention efforts. In addition, it is of interest to assess whether improvements in HIV-related knowledge may actually lead to increased engagement in preventive behaviours and ultimately lower HIV transmission. This study therefore aims to systematically review and meta-analyse the evidence for the effect of HIV-related knowledge interventions on 1) the improvement of HIV-related knowledge, 2) subsequent risk reduction behaviour (condom use), 3) lower incidence of HIV infection. METHODS A literature search was conducted using the Embase and Medline databases, returning 746 after duplicate removal. Following abstract and full-text screening, 36 studies were ultimately included in the final review. Meta-analyses were conducted in R, using random-effects models, for the HIV-related knowledge, condom use, and HIV incidence outcomes, where sufficient data were available. RESULTS Interventions assessed in the reviewed studies varied, including computer-based interventions, mass media campaigns, and peer education interventions. The interventions were generally found to be effective at improving HIV-related knowledge in the target population, with 10 studies reporting improved knowledge of risk reduction through condom use in the intervention group (out of 11 studies reporting data for this outcome), with 6 reporting these differences as significant (p < 0.05). Regarding knowledge of transmission routes, studies assessing peer education interventions often reported significant improvements in the intervention group. Meta-analysis results showed significantly higher odds among the intervention groups of correct knowledge of: risk reduction through condom use (OR: 3.09, 95%CI: 1.83-5.22, p < 0.0001), sexual transmission of HIV (OR: 5.86, 95%CI: 2.65-12.97, p < 0.001) and transmission through sharps (OR: 4.35, 95%CI = 3.21-5.90, p < 0.001), but non-significantly lower odds of HIV infection (OR: 0.97, 95%CI: 0.66-1.41, p = 0.854). CONCLUSION Peer-education-based interventions appear to be particularly effective in facilitating the uptake of HIV-related knowledge, particularly pertaining to transmission routes. There is some evidence that improved knowledge of HIV transmission and prevention facilitates increased subsequent engagement in preventive measures, although this requires further exploration.

The aim of this study was to analyze outcome and complications in a large cohort of patients with stroke treated with the Solitaire stent retriever. The study also included patients who did not meet standard inclusion criteria for endovascular treatment: low or high baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, ≥80 years of age, extensive ischemic signs in middle cerebral artery territory, and time from symptom onset to endovascular intervention>8 hours. METHODS Consecutive patients with acute anterior circulation stroke treated with the Solitaire FR were analyzed. Data on characteristics of endovascular interventions, complications, and clinical outcome were collected prospectively. Patients who met standard inclusion criteria were compared with those who did not. RESULTS A total of 227 patients were included. Mean age was 68.2±14.7 years, and median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score on admission was 16 (range, 2-36). Reperfusion was successful (thrombolysis in cerebral infarction, 2b-3) in 70.9%. Outcome was favorable (modified Rankin Scale, 0-2) in 57.7% of patients who met standard inclusion criteria and 30.3% of those who did not. The rates for symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage were 3.7% and 13.1%, for death 11.4% and 33.8%, and for symptomatic intraprocedural complications 2.5% and 4.8%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Patients<80 years of age, without extensive pretreatment ischemic signs, and baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score≤30 had high rates of favorable outcome and low periprocedural complication rates after Solitaire thrombectomy. Successful reperfusion was also common in patients not fulfilling standard inclusion criteria, but worse clinical outcomes warrant further research with a special focus on optimal patient selection.","Gratz, Pascal P; Jung, Simon; Schroth, Gerhard; Gralla, Jan; Mordasini, Pasquale; Hsieh, Kety; Heldner, Mirjam R; Mattle, Heinrich P; Mono, Marie-Luise; Fischer, Urs; Arnold, Marcel; Zubler, Christoph",Stroke,https://doi.org/10.1161/strokeaha.113.002591; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24262328/,134

The purpose of this study was to: 1) explore how students define basic needs, 2) understand experiences of housing insecurity, and 3) understand experiences of food insecurity within the context of housing insecurity. DESIGN Qualitative research elicited student perceptions of basic needs and experiences of housing and food insecurity. SETTING Focus group discussions were conducted at 5 University of California campuses between February and March 2019. PARTICIPANTS Undergraduate (n = 37) and graduate (n = 21) students were recruited from campus basic needs centers. METHODS Each student completed a brief survey. Researchers conducted 11 focus groups using a semi-structured interview guide. Transcripts were coded to identify themes. RESULTS Students were female (76%), age 23.6 (SD = 5.8) years; 46% were Pell grant recipients; and 52% were first-generation college students. Most had experienced food insecurity (98%) and 26% had experienced homelessness. Eight themes were identified: 1) students define basic needs as more than minimal food and shelter and as the responsibility of students and the university, 2) students encounter multifaceted housing insecurity issues, 3) affording rent is a priority that most often leads to experiencing food insecurity, 4) transportation barriers interfere with meeting students' basic needs to succeed as students, 5) students with nontraditional characteristics, graduate students, and out-of-state students face unique challenges in meeting basic needs, 6) limited financial aid and lack of financial aid guidance are barriers to meeting basic needs, 7) fees contribute additional challenges to students meeting basic needs, and 8) additional university basic needs services are essential. CONCLUSION A student-informed definition of basic needs included food, housing, mental health, sleep, hygiene, and transportation. This understanding of basic needs can inform future research, programs, and policy to address housing insecurity in higher education.","Martinez, Suzanna M; Esaryk, Erin E; Moffat, Laurel; Ritchie, Lorrene",American journal of health promotion : AJHP,https://doi.org/10.1177/0890117121992295; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33611931/,134

The objectives of this study were to examine the utility of the above for identifying LSI needs and compare different LSI-associated models, with the hypothesis that an ML model would be superior in performance over multivariate logistic regression models. One hundred four patients transported from the injury scene via helicopter were selected for the study. A wireless vital signs monitor was attached to the patient's arm and used to capture physiologic data, including HRV and HRC. The power of vital sign measurements, HRV, HRC, and Glasgow Coma Scale score (GCS) to identify patients requiring LSIs was estimated using multivariate logistic regression and ML. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were also obtained. Thirty-two patients underwent 75 LSIs. After logistic regression, ROC curves demonstrated better identification for LSIs using heart rate (HR) and HRC (area under the curve [AUC] of 0.81) than using HR alone (AUC of 0.73). Likewise, ROC curves demonstrated better identification for LSIs using GCS and HRC (AUC of 0.94) than using GCS and HR (AUC of 0.92). Importantly, ROC curves demonstrated that an ML model using HR, GCS, and HRC (AUC of 0.99) had superior performance over multivariate logistic regression models for identifying the need for LSIs in trauma patients. Development of computer decision support systems should utilize vital signs, HRC, and ML in order to achieve more accurate diagnostic capabilities, such as identification of needs for LSIs in trauma patients.","Liu, Nehemiah T; Holcomb, John B; Wade, Charles E; Darrah, Mark I; Salinas, Jose",Shock,https://doi.org/10.1097/shk.0000000000000186; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24727872/,134
74697,Emerging ideas on changes to 'under our care'.,2020-05-30,"Background Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a major complication after lower-limb arthroplasty that increases costs and reduces patient's quality of life. Using anticoagulants for 10-35 days following arthroplasty is the standard prophylaxis, but its cost-effectiveness after accounting for bleeding complications remains unproven. Methods A comprehensive, clinical model of VTE was created using the incidences, clinical effects (including bleeding), and costs of VTE and prophylaxis from randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses, and large observational studies. Over 50 years, the total health care costs and clinical impact of three prophylaxis strategies, that are as follows, were compared: low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) alone, intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC), and IPC with LMWH (IPC+LMWH). The cost per VTE event that was avoided and cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained in both the US and Australian health care settings were calculated. Results For every 2,000 patients, the expected number of VTE and major bleeding events with LMWH were 151 and 6 in the USA and 160 and 46 in Australia, resulting in a mean of 11.3 and 9.1 QALYs per patient, respectively. IPC reduced the expected VTE events by 11 and 8 in the USA and Australia, respectively, compared to using LMWH alone. IPC reduced major bleeding events compared to LMWH, preventing 1 event in the US and 7 in Australia. IPC+LMWH only reduced VTE events. Neither intervention substantially impacted QALYs but both increased QALYs versus LMWH. IPC was cost-effective followed by IPC+LMWH. Conclusion IPC and IPC+LMWH are cost-effective versus LMWH after lower-limb arthroplasty in the USA and Australia. The choice between IPC and IPC+LMWH depends on expected bleeding risks.","Saunders, Rhodri; Comerota, Anthony J; Ozols, Audrey; Torrejon Torres, Rafael; Ho, Kwok Ming",ClinicoEconomics and outcomes research : CEOR,https://doi.org/10.2147/ceor.s157306; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29719413/,134
74723,Effects of Total Abdominal Hysterectomy and Total Laparoscopic Hysterectomy on Urinary Tract Dysfunction.,2020,"BACKGROUND The expansion of endoscopic endonasal skull base surgery has resulted in an increased demand for reconstructive options. Reconstruction with vascularized tissue has proven indispensable for reliably separating the cranial contents from the paranasal sinuses following extended endoscopic endonasal approaches (EEA). The introduction of the Hadad-Bassagasteguy flap (vascular pedicle nasoseptal flap, HBF) at our institution decreased our postoperative cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) leak rates from more than 20% to less than 5%. The HBF is not always available, as the nasoseptal area or its vascular supply can be compromised by tumor or prior surgery. In an attempt to keep pace with rapidly expanding reconstructive requirements, we present the anatomic and cadaveric foundations for novel modifications of the facial artery musculo (-mucosal) (FAM[M]) and buccinator flaps to allow vascularized reconstruction of the skull base. STUDY DESIGN Feasibility. Cadaveric study. METHODS Using cadaver dissections and measurements, we investigated the feasibility of transposing pedicled buccinator myo/myomucosal flaps into the nasal cavity and skull base. Both muscular and myomuscular flaps were raised, and techniques for transposition into the nasal cavity were investigated. Three fresh and six preserved human specimens were dissected. RESULTS Pedicled facial buccinator flaps with and without mucosa were transposed into the nasal cavity using a variety of maxillary osteotomies. No facial incisions were required. It was demonstrated that the flaps reach the anterior skull base and planum sphenoidale. CONCLUSIONS The transposition of pedicled buccinator muscle flaps with and without mucosa into the nasal cavity could reach the anterior skull base and planum sphenoidale, if the appropriate surgical technique is used. The pedicled Facial Buccinator Flap holds significant potential as a reconstructive alternative for a variety of skull base defects, alone or in combination with existing reconstructive options. 2010.","Rivera-Serrano, Carlos M; Oliver, Christopher L; Sok, John; Prevedello, Daniel M; Gardner, Paul; Snyderman, Carl H; Kassam, Amin B; Carrau, Ricardo L",The Laryngoscope,https://doi.org/10.1002/lary.21049; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20824643/,134
74819,Equine disease surveillance: quarterly summary.,2018,"Coatomer protein I (COPI) is well known as the protein coat surrounding vesicles involved in returning endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident proteins to the ER. COPI coats are also found in vesicles involved in other trafficking processes including endocytosis, autophagy and anterograde transport in the secretory pathway. In view of the diverse functions of COPI proteins, it is expected that they will affect virus replication, and many reports of such COPI involvement have now appeared. The experimental approaches most often employ specific siRNA to deplete COPI subunits or brefeldin A to block COPI activation. Here we briefly describe the results obtained with viruses in which COPI is found to have a role in replication. The results demonstrate that COPI affects viruses quite differently with effects observed in processes such as entry, RNA replication, and intracellular transport of viral proteins.","Thompson, Jennifer A; Brown, Jay C",Journal of virology & antiviral research,https://doi.org/10.4172/2324-8955.1000102; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24392458/,134

75830,Lymphatic mapping helps to define resection margins for midgut carcinoids.,2009,"Abstract Invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) is a notifiable disease in Australia, and both probable and laboratory-confirmed cases of IMD are reported to the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). In 2020, there were 90 notifications of IMD, the lowest number documented since records began in the NNDSS in 1991. Of these, 97% (87/90) were laboratory-confirmed cases, with 70% (61/87) confirmed by bacterial culture and 30% (26/87) by nucleic acid amplification testing. The serogroup was determined for 85/87 laboratory-confirmed cases of IMD: serogroup B (MenB) accounted for 64% of infections (54/85); MenW for 19% (16/85); MenY for 16% (14/85); and MenC 1.2% (1/85). Fine typing was available on 60/85 (71%) of cases with serogroup determined; of the typed MenW, all were PorA antigen type P1.5,2 and sequence type 11, the hypervirulent strain reported in recent outbreaks in Australia and overseas. The primary peaks of IMD notifications in Australia in 2020 were observed in infants less than 1 year (16/87, 18%) and in adults aged 45-64 years (14/87, 16%). MenB infections predominated in those aged less than 5 years and 15-19 years; MenW and MenY infections predominated in those aged 45 years or more. All 61 IMD isolates were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility: none were penicillin resistant; however, 56/61 (92%) had decreased susceptibility to penicillin. All isolates were susceptible to ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin and rifampicin.","Lahra, Monica M; George, C R Robert; Shoushtari, Masoud; Hogan, Tiffany R",Communicable diseases intelligence,https://doi.org/10.33321/cdi.2021.45.46; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34496732/,134

STUDY DESIGN Prospective, single-center, blinded observational cohort study. SETTING PICU in a tertiary hospital in The Netherlands. PATIENTS Children under 12 years old undergoing elective cardiac surgery were enrolled in the study after informed consent of the parents/guardians. INTERVENTIONS The parents/guardians filled out a questionnaire regarding respiratory symptoms. On the day of the operation, a nasopharyngeal swab was obtained. Clinical data were collected during PICU admission, and PICU/hospital length of stay were reported. If a patient was still intubated 3 days after operation, an additional nasopharyngeal swab was collected. Nasopharyngeal swabs were tested for rhinovirus and other respiratory viruses with polymerase chain reaction. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Of the 163 included children, 74 (45%) tested rhinovirus positive. Rhinovirus-positive patients did not have a prolonged PICU length of stay (median 2 d each; p = 0.257). Rhinovirus-positive patients had a significantly shorter median hospital length of stay compared with rhinovirus-negative patients (8 vs 9 d, respectively; p = 0.006). Overall, 97 of the patients (60%) tested positive for one or more respiratory virus. Virus-positive patients had significantly shorter PICU and hospital length of stay, ventilatory support, and nonmechanical ventilation. Virus-negative patients had respiratory symptoms suspected for a respiratory infection more often. In 31% of the children, the parents reported mild upper respiratory complaints a day prior to the cardiac surgery, this was associated with postextubation stridor, but no other clinical outcome measures. CONCLUSIONS Preoperative rhinovirus polymerase chain reaction positivity is not associated with prolonged PICU length of stay. Our findings do not support the use of routine polymerase chain reaction testing for respiratory viruses in asymptomatic children admitted for elective cardiac surgery.","Roeleveld, Peter Paul; Van Rijn, Anneloes L; de Wilde, Rob B P; van Zwet, Erik W; Wink, Jeroen; Rozendaal, Lieke; Hogenbirk, Karin; Hazekamp, Mark G; Man, Wing Ho; Sidorov, Igor; Kraakman, Margriet E M; Claas, Eric C J; de Jonge, Evert; Kroes, Aloys C M; de Vries, Jutte J C",Pediatric critical care medicine : a journal of the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the World Federation of Pediatric Intensive and Critical Care Societies,https://doi.org/10.1097/pcc.0000000000002522; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33027243/,134
76235,[Improvement of operative conditions during a laparoscopic prosthetic sacral colpopexy for pelvic organ prolapse repair].,2009,"Upland soil clusters alpha and gamma (USCα and USCγ) are considered a major biological sink of atmospheric methane and are often detected in forest and grassland soils. These clusters are phylogenetically classified using the particulate methane monooxygenase gene pmoA because of the difficulty of cultivation. Recent studies have established a direct link of pmoA genes to 16S rRNA genes based on their isolated strain or draft genomes. However, whether the results of pmoA-based assays could be largely represented by 16S rRNA gene sequencing in upland soils remains unclear. In this study, we collected 20 forest soils across China and compared methane-oxidizing bacterial (MOB) communities by high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA and pmoA genes using different primer sets. The results showed that 16S rRNA gene sequencing and the semi-nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of the pmoA gene (A189/A682r nested with a mixture of mb661 and A650) consistently revealed the dominance of USCα (accounting for more than 50% of the total MOB) in 12 forest soils. A189f/A682r successfully amplified pmoA genes (mainly RA14 of USCα) in only three forest soils. A189f/mb661 could amplify USCα (mainly JR1) in several forest soils but showed a strong preferential amplification of Methylocystis and many other type I MOB groups. A189f/A650 almost exclusively amplified USCα (mainly JR1) and largely discriminated against Methylocystis and most of the other MOB groups. The semi-nested PCR approach weakened the bias of A189f/mb661 and A189f/A650 for JR1 and balanced the coverage of all USCα members. The canonical correspondence analysis indicated that soil NH4+-N and pH were the main environmental factors affecting the MOB community of Chinese forest soils. The RA14 of the USCα group prefers to live in soils with low pH, low temperature, low elevation, high precipitation, and rich in nitrogen. JR1's preferences for temperature and elevation were opposite to RA14. Our study suggests that combining the deep sequencing of 16S rRNA and pmoA genes to characterize MOB in forest soils is the best choice.","Cai, Yuanfeng; Zhou, Xue; Shi, Limei; Jia, Zhongjun",Microbial ecology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00248-020-01570-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32803363/,134
76649,Single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy with an additional needle grasper: a novel technique.,2015,"Importance Recent reports from communities severely affected by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic found lower rates of sustained return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Whether the pandemic has affected OHCA outcomes more broadly is unknown. Objective To assess the association between the COVID-19 pandemic and OHCA outcomes, including in areas with low and moderate COVID-19 disease burden. Design, Setting, and Participants This study used a large US registry of OHCAs to compare outcomes during the pandemic period of March 16 through April 30, 2020, with those from March 16 through April 30, 2019. Cases were geocoded to US counties, and the COVID-19 mortality rate in each county was categorized as very low (0-25 per million residents), low (26-100 per million residents), moderate (101-250 per million residents), high (251-500 per million residents), or very high (>500 per million residents). As additional controls, the study compared OHCA outcomes during the prepandemic period (January through February) and peripandemic period (March 1 through 15). Exposure The COVID-19 pandemic. Main Outcomes and Measures Sustained ROSC (≥20 minutes), survival to discharge, and OHCA incidence. Results A total of 19 303 OHCAs occurred from March 16 through April 30 in both years, with 9863 cases in 2020 (mean [SD] age, 62.6 [19.3] years; 6040 men [61.3%]) and 9440 in 2019 (mean [SD] age, 62.2 [19.2] years; 5922 men [62.7%]). During the pandemic, rates of sustained ROSC were lower than in 2019 (23.0% vs 29.8%; adjusted rate ratio, 0.82 [95% CI, 0.78-0.87]; P < .001). Sustained ROSC rates were lower by between 21% (286 of 1429 [20.0%] in 2020 vs 305 of 1130 [27.0%] in 2019; adjusted RR, 0.79 [95% CI, 0.65-0.97]) and 33% (149 of 863 [17.3%] in 2020 vs 192 of 667 [28.8%] in 2019; adjusted RR, 0.67 [95% CI, 0.56-0.80]) in communities with high or very high COVID-19 mortality, respectively; however, rates of sustained ROSC were also lower by 11% (583 of 2317 [25.2%] in 2020 vs 740 of 2549 [29.0%] in 2019; adjusted RR, 0.89 [95% CI, 0.81-0.98]) to 15% (889 of 3495 [25.4%] in 2020 vs 1109 of 3532 [31.4%] in 2019; adjusted RR, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.78-0.93]) in communities with very low and low COVID-19 mortality. Among emergency medical services agencies with complete data on hospital survival (7085 total patients), survival to discharge was lower during the pandemic compared with 2019 (6.6% vs 9.8%; adjusted RR, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.69-1.00]; P = .048), primarily in communities with moderate to very high COVID-19 mortality (interaction P = .049). Incidence of OHCA was higher than in 2019, but the increase was largely observed in communities with high COVID-19 mortality (adjusted mean difference, 38.6 [95% CI, 37.1-40.1] per million residents) and very high COVID-19 mortality (adjusted mean difference, 28.7 [95% CI, 26.7-30.6] per million residents). In contrast, there was no difference in rates of sustained ROSC or survival to discharge during the prepandemic and peripandemic periods in 2020 vs 2019. Conclusions and Relevance Early during the pandemic, rates of sustained ROSC for OHCA were lower throughout the US, even in communities with low COVID-19 mortality rates. Overall survival was lower, primarily in communities with moderate or high COVID-19 mortality.","Chan, Paul S; Girotra, Saket; Tang, Yuanyuan; Al-Araji, Rabab; Nallamothu, Brahmajee K; McNally, Bryan",JAMA cardiology,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamacardio.2020.6210; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33188678/,134

Paracetamol is one of the most prescribed and purchased drugs that has been widely detected in wastewater and surface water. The present study investigated paracetamol degradation by photocatalytic treatment in a batch system using TiO2 supported on aluminosilicate recovered from waste LED panel (ATiO2). The prepared ATiO2 catalyst was characterized for morphology, elemental composition and crystallinity using scanning electron microscope (SEM) with electron dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD), respectively. ATiO2 was spherical in morphology with a predominance of the anatase phase of TiO2 and an average size of ∼15 nm. Subsequently, the effects of operating parameters, viz., initial paracetamol concentration (1-10 mg/L), catalyst dosage (0.5-4.0 g/L) and pH (4-10) on paracetamol degradation were investigated using central composite design (CCD). A polynomial model was developed to interpret the linear and interactive effect of operating parameters on the paracetamol degradation efficiency. About 99% degradation efficiency of paracetamol was obtained at optimum conditions (Initial paracetamol concentration ∼2.74 mg/L, ATiO2 dosage ∼2.71 g/L and pH ∼ 9.5). The mechanism of paracetamol degradation was adsorption on aluminosilicate and subsequent degradation by TiO2. ATiO2 could be effectively reused up to 3 cycles, with <5% decrease in the degradation efficiency.","Jayasree, Pyla; Remya, Neelancherry",Water science and technology : a journal of the International Association on Water Pollution Research,https://doi.org/10.2166/wst.2020.484; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33263588/,134

All queries were collected and categorized. Responses to the queries were given according to the recommendations by the Ophthalmology association. Practices ability to deal with the COVID were also classified according to country and type of access to PPE. Statistical analyses of the association between these data and queries, where appropriate were carried out.Results: One thousand nine hundred sixteen ophthalmologists were invited to participate in a survey between April 10th and April 30th, 2020 of which 1207 responded, which is a response rate of approximately 63%. The majority of respondents were from India, Indonesia, China, Singapore and the USA. Our study indicates a precipitous drop in surgical procedures with 46% (n = 538) ophthalmologists ceased to operate on their patients and almost 40% (n = 486) were doing less than 25% of their original number of surgeries. The intent to resume elective surgeries was a consideration in 41% (n = 495) after an evaluation of the situation and in consultation with professional bodies. More than 2/3 of the respondents (n = 703) made it a priority to use and mandate their patients to practice physical distancing, wearing masks, and hand dis-infection for protection to limit the spread of infection.Conclusion: This global survey provides a real-world assessment of diverse practices that were in various forms of ""shut down mode"" and circumstances with varying capabilities to deal with COVID.

77056,Successful Outcomes in Robot-Assisted Laparoscopic Pyeloplasty Using a Unidirectional Barbed Suture.,2016,"BACKGROUND Although generally known as a human commensal, Staphylococcus epidermidis is also an opportunistic pathogen that can cause nosocomial infections related to foreign body materials and immunocompromized patients. Infections are often caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) lineages that are difficult and costly to treat, and can have a major adverse impact on patients' quality of life. Heterogeneity is a common phenomenon in both carriage and infection, but present methodology for detection of this is laborious or expensive. In this study, we present a culture-independent method, labelled Epidome, based on an amplicon sequencing-approach to deliver information beyond species level on primary samples and to elucidate clonality, population structure and temporal stability or niche selection of S. epidermidis communities. RESULTS Based on an assessment of > 800 genes from the S. epidermidis core genome, we identified genes with variable regions, which in combination facilitated the differentiation of phylogenetic clusters observed in silico, and allowed classification down to lineage level. A duplex PCR, combined with an amplicon sequencing protocol, and a downstream analysis pipeline were designed to provide subspecies information from primary samples. Additionally, a probe-based qPCR was designed to provide valuable absolute abundance quantification of S. epidermidis. The approach was validated on isolates representing skin commensals and on genomic mock communities with a sensitivity of < 10 copies/μL. The method was furthermore applied to a sample set of primary skin and nasal samples, revealing a high degree of heterogeneity in the S. epidermidis populations. Additionally, the qPCR showed a high degree of variation in absolute abundance of S. epidermidis. CONCLUSIONS The Epidome method is designed for use on primary samples to obtain important information on S. epidermidis abundance and diversity beyond species-level to answer questions regarding the emergence and dissemination of nosocomial lineages, investigating clonality of S. epidermidis communities, population dynamics, and niche selection. Our targeted-sequencing method allows rapid differentiation and identification of clinically important nosocomial lineages in low-biomass samples such as skin samples.","Rendboe, Amalie Katrine; Johannesen, Thor Bech; Ingham, Anna Cäcilia; Månsson, Emeli; Iversen, Søren; Baig, Sharmin; Edslev, Sofie; Jensen, Jørgen Skov; Söderquist, Bo; Andersen, Paal Skytt; Stegger, Marc",BMC microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12866-020-02041-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33243146/,134

In an attempt to develop novel and save therapies against the infection it was tested whether EAV is susceptible to RNA interference (RNAi) in an equine in vitro system. Horse cells were transfected with chemically synthesized small interfering RNA oligonucleotides (siRNAs) and challenged with EAV. Application of these siRNAs led to a significant protection of the cells, and virus titers decreased drastically. siRNAs derived from DNA plasmids expressing small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) were also effective. The protection was most pronounced with two siRNAs targeting the open reading frame 1 (coding for non-structural proteins), whereas siRNAs targeting sequences for several structural proteins had less or no effect. In addition, it was investigated whether RNAi could be used to treat cells with an already established viral infection. Only application of the siRNAs shortly after viral challenge led to significant survival rates of the cells, whereas transfection at later time points caused much less benefit for the cells. These findings are discussed in a perspective of using RNAi as a therapeutic approach to combat EAV.","Heinrich, Anett; Riethmüller, Diana; Gloger, Marleen; Schusser, Gerald F; Giese, Matthias; Ulbert, Sebastian",Antiviral research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2008.10.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19007819/,134

Participants were 541 individuals from family members of patients with COVID-19 (F = 52.3%, Mean age = 41.3±13.2 years). Data were collected with a packet including socio-demographic and risk factors, the Fear of COVID-19 Scale, the Short Health Anxiety Inventory, the Metacognitions Questionnaire-30, the Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale-12, and the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire. Structural equation modeling analyses revealed a full mediation of metacognitions (i.e., positive beliefs about worry, negative beliefs about thoughts concerning uncontrollability and danger, cognitive confidence, and beliefs about the need to control thoughts), intolerance of uncertainty, and expressive suppression in the relation between FC-19 and health anxiety. Moreover, the strongest indirect links were found between FC-19 and health anxiety through negative beliefs about thoughts concerning uncontrollability and danger and intolerance of uncertainty. These associations were independent of gender and risk status. The final model accounted for 71% of the variance of health anxiety. These findings suggest that particularly metacognitions, intolerance of uncertainty and expressive suppression play a full mediational role in the relation between FC-19 and health anxiety.","Akbari, Mehdi; Spada, Marcantonio M; Nikčević, Ana V; Zamani, Elahe",Clinical psychology & psychotherapy,https://doi.org/10.1002/cpp.2628; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34110670/,134

METHODS From our trans-sphenoidal surgical series of 331 cases, we retrospectively reviewed visual, endocrine and neuro-cognitive outcomes in the first consecutive eight patients (median age 63 years; range 47-73 years) with newly diagnosed supradiaphragmatic craniopharyngioma (median tumour height 23 mm; range 15-34 mm), removed by expanded endonasal approach (median follow-up 27 months; range 10-69 months). Gross total resection was attempted in all patients. RESULTS Gross total resection was achieved in 6 of 8 patients. Visual improvement was present in 6 of 8 patients of patients or in 14 of 16 eyes. New endocrinopathy, including diabetes insipidus, appeared in 5 of 8 patients. Stalk was preserved in 4 patients. Cognitive decline was present in 2 cases. Five of 8 patients retained previous quality of life. CONCLUSIONS Our early outcome results are comparable to the recent few expanded endonasal approach series, except for the incidence of new endocrinopathy and cerebrospinal fluid leak rate. This was influenced by higher number of transinfundibular tumours in our series, where stalk preservation is less likely, and not using nasoseptal flap or gasket closure in the first half of cases. Including data from the literature and ours, expanded endonasal approach shows a trend for improved gross total resection rate with less morbidity, more obviously for visual outcome and quality of life than for endocrine outcome. However, validity of expanded endonasal approach should be confirmed in a larger number of patients with a longer follow-up period.","Bosnjak, Roman; Benedicic, Mitja; Vittori, Alenka",Radiology and oncology,https://doi.org/10.2478/raon-2013-0036; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24133392/,134

However, factors such as gastric acidity and hydrodynamics in the gastric environment may influence drug disposition. Although a link between gastrointestinal drug behaviour and gastric motility has often been hypothesized, they have not been simultaneously investigated in humans yet. In this proof-of-concept study, the combination of a well-established intraluminal sampling technique with high-resolution manometric measurements in the gastrointestinal tract was evaluated. This new combination of in vivo techniques proved to be feasible from a practical point of view and yielded valuable additional information regarding intraluminal drug behaviour. As a first application, the link between fasted state gastric motility and (in)homogeneous distribution of an orally administered drug in the stomach was investigated in healthy subjects. To this end, drug concentrations were measured in different regions of the stomach after oral administration of a commercially available drug product (Gabbroral®, 250mg paromomycin) during a specific period of gastric contractile activity. A clear trend towards better mixing of an orally administered drug with gastric contents was observed when dosed in the presence of gastric contractions, resulting in a more homogeneous distribution of the drug throughout the stomach compared to dosing in the absence of gastric contractions.","Van Den Abeele, Jens; Brouwers, Joachim; Tack, Jan; Augustijns, Patrick",European journal of pharmaceutics and biopharmaceutics : official journal of Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Pharmazeutische Verfahrenstechnik e.V,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejpb.2016.10.027; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27865990/,134

78096,Are There Gender-Specific Aspects in Obesity and Metabolic Surgery? Data Analysis from the German Bariatric Surgery Registry.,2014,"OBJECTIVES This study sought to develop a novel technique called bioprosthetic or native aortic scallop intentional laceration to prevent coronary artery obstruction (BASILICA). BACKGROUND Coronary artery obstruction is a rare but fatal complication of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). METHODS We lacerated pericardial leaflets in vitro using catheter electrosurgery, and tested leaflet splaying after benchtop TAVR. The procedure was tested in swine. BASILICA was then offered to patients at high risk of coronary obstruction from TAVR and ineligible for surgical aortic valve replacement. BASILICA used marketed devices. Catheters directed an electrified guidewire to traverse and lacerate the aortic leaflet down the center line. TAVR was performed as usual. RESULTS TAVR splayed lacerated bovine pericardial leaflets. BASILICA was successful in pigs, both to left and right cusps. Necropsy revealed full length lacerations with no collateral thermal injury. Seven patients underwent BASILICA on a compassionate basis. Six had failed bioprosthetic valves, both stented and stent-less. Two had severe aortic stenosis, including 1 patient with native disease, 3 had severe aortic regurgitation, and 2 had mixed aortic valve disease. One patient required laceration of both left and right coronary cusps. There was no hemodynamic compromise in any patient following BASILICA. All patients had successful TAVR, with no coronary obstruction, stroke, or any major complications. All patients survived to 30 days. CONCLUSIONS BASILICA may durably prevent coronary obstruction from TAVR. The procedure was successful across a range of presentations, and requires further evaluation in a prospective trial. Its role in treatment of degenerated TAVR devices remains untested.","Khan, Jaffar M; Dvir, Danny; Greenbaum, Adam B; Babaliaros, Vasilis C; Rogers, Toby; Aldea, Gabriel; Reisman, Mark; Mackensen, G Burkhard; Eng, Marvin H K; Paone, Gaetano; Wang, Dee Dee; Guyton, Robert A; Devireddy, Chandan M; Schenke, William H; Lederman, Robert J",JACC.

79029,Laparoscopic splenectomy for tuberculous abscess of the spleen.,2010,"BACKGROUND Although urinary adverse events after treatment of prostate cancer (CaP) are common, population-based studies on functional outcomes are scarce. The aim of this study is to evaluate the occurrence of urinary incontinence (UI) and erectile dysfunction (ED) in daily clinical practice using a nationwide Dutch cohort of patients with localized or locally advanced CaP. BASIC PROCEDURES Patients were invited to complete the EPIC-26 questionnaire before treatment (baseline) and at 12 and 24 months after diagnosis. We calculated the mean EPIC-26 domain scores, stratified by treatment modality (i.e., radical prostatectomy, external radiotherapy, and no active treatment), and the proportions of patients with UI (defined as ≥ 2 pads per day) and ED (defined as erections not firm enough for sexual intercourse). Logistic regression modeling was used to explore the factors related to UI and ED after surgery. MAIN FINDINGS In total 1,759 patients participated in this study. Patients undergoing radical prostatectomy experienced clinically relevant worsening in the urinary incontinence domain. After excluding patients who reported UI at baseline, 15% of patients with prostatectomy reported UI 24 months after diagnosis. Only comorbidity was associated with UI in surgically treated patients. Regardless of treatment, patients reported a clinically significant reduced sexual functioning over time. Before treatment, 54% of patients reported ED. Among the 46% remaining patients, 87% of patients treated with radical prostatectomy reported ED 24 months after diagnosis, 41% after radiotherapy, and 46% in patients without active treatment. Bilateral nerve-sparing surgery was the only factor associated with ED after 24 months. PRINCIPAL CONCLUSIONS UI and ED frequently occur in patients with localized and locally advanced CaP, in particular after radical prostatectomy. The higher occurrence rate of UI and ED, compared with clinical trial participants, supports the importance of real-world data, which can be used for local treatment recommendations and patient information, but also to evaluate effects of future initiatives, such as treatment centralization and research aimed at improving functional outcomes.","Vernooij, R W M; Cremers, R G H M; Jansen, H; Somford, D M; Kiemeney, L A; van Andel, G; Wijsman, B P; Busstra, M B; van Moorselaar, R J A; Wijnen, E M; Pos, F J; Hulshof, M C C M; Hamberg, P; van den Berkmortel, F; Hulsbergen-van de Kaa, C A; van Leenders, G J L H; Fütterer, J J; van Oort, I M; Aben, K K H",Urologic oncology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.urolonc.2020.05.022; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32680820/,134
79048,Laparoscopic simulation for surgical residents in Ethiopia: course development and results.,2016,"The objectives of this evidence scoping review were to identify and characterize studies investigating weight management interventions provided by a registered dietitian nutritionist or international equivalent (RDN) among adults with overweight or obesity. A medical librarian conducted an electronic literature search in 6 databases-MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), PyscINFO (Ovid), Cochrane CENTRAL (Ovid), Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (Ovid), and CINAHL (Ebsco). Except for narrative review, gray literature, and case study or report, all types of peer-reviewed articles published between January 2008 and April 26, 2019 were eligible. Two content advisors, who are experts in adult weight management, guided the process and reviewed the search plan and findings. The literature search resulted in 30,551 records with 16 additional records identified through other sources. A total of 29,756 records were excluded during the first round of screening due to duplication or irrelevancy. Of the 811 full-text articles that were screened, 139 met the criteria and were included. Approximately 51% and 43% of the studies were conducted in the community setting and in the United States or Canada, respectively. Over 97% of the studies were clinical or quasi-experimental trials. A total of 6 different intervention delivery modes were reported, which resulted in 22 combinations of the modes of delivery. RDNs delivered the weight management intervention (especially the nutrition component) in all studies, but some (61%) also involved an interdisciplinary team to deliver other components of the intervention. The average length of the intervention was about 10 months with a follow-up that ranged from 0 to 9 years. The commonly reported outcomes were anthropometrics, endocrine, and cardiovascular measures; dietary intake; and physical activity. Based on the scoping review, there were systematic reviews and evidence-based practice guidelines on weight management interventions but none of them met the a priori inclusion or exclusion criteria. Therefore, it would be beneficial to conduct a systematic review and develop an evidence-based practice guideline on adult weight management interventions provided by an RDN to guide practitioners and to evaluate their effects on health and nutrition-related outcomes.","Cheng, Feon W; Garay, Jessica L; Handu, Deepa",Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jand.2020.07.022; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33069660/,134
79328,Are there anatomical barriers to laparoscopic donor nephrectomy?,2010,"Isoprene emission has been considered to protect plants from heat stress, but there is limited information of how sustained heat spells which can be particularly severe under drought alters the plant capacity to produce isoprene. Under combined long-term stresses isoprene emission could contribute to maintenance of the precursor pool for rapid synthesis of essential isoprenoids to repair damaged component of leaf photosynthetic apparatus. We studied changes in foliage isoprene emission rate (I), foliage photosynthetic characteristics and antioxidant enzyme activities in two hybrid Populus clones, Nanlin 1388 (higher drought tolerance) and Nanlin 895 (higher thermotolerance), subject to a long-term (30 d) soil water stress (25% vs. 90% field capacity) combined with a natural heat spell (daytime temperature of 35-40 °C). Unexpectedly, isoprene emission of both clones performed similarly and the overall effects of drought on isoprene emission characteristics were initially minor, but the treatment effects and clonal differences increased in time. In particular, I only slightly increased in control plants of Nanlin 895 after 15 d of treatment, and it decreased more than 5-fold in all treatment and clone combinations after 30 d. The reduction in I was associated with decreased isoprene precursor dimethylallyl diphosphate pool size in all cases in 30 d after the start of treatment. Net assimilation rate, stomatal conductance, PSII center openness and effective quantum yield decreased, while non-photochemical quenching and catalase activity increased in both control and water-stressed plants. Contrary to expectations, the data collectively indicated that isoprene emission responded more sensitively to sustained stress than foliage photosynthetic characteristics. This primarily reflected the depletion of isoprene precursor pools under long-term severe stress.","Sun, Zhihong; Shen, Yan; Niinemets, Ülo",Journal of experimental botany,https://doi.org/10.1093/jxb/eraa412; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32901258/,134
79389,Rectovaginal fistula: a new technique and preliminary results using collagen matrix biomesh.,2014,"Proteomics studies allow for the determination of the identity, amount, and interactions of proteins under specific conditions that allow the biological state of an organism to ultimately change. These conditions can be either beneficial or detrimental. Diseases are due to detrimental changes caused by either protein overexpression or underexpression caused by as a result of a mutation or posttranslational modifications (PTM), among other factors. Identification of disease biomarkers through proteomics can be potentially used as clinical information for diagnostics. Common biomarkers to look for include PTM. For example, aberrant glycosylation of proteins is a common marker and will be a focus of interest in this review. A common way to analyze glycoproteins is by glycoproteomics involving mass spectrometry. Due to factors such as micro- and macroheterogeneity which result in a lower abundance of each version of a glycoprotein, it is difficult to obtain meaningful results unless rigorous sample preparation procedures are in place. Microheterogeneity represents the diversity of glycans at a single site, whereas macroheterogeneity depicts glycosylation levels at each site of a protein. Enrichment and derivatization of glycopeptides help to overcome these limitations. Over the time range of 2016 to 2020, several methods have been proposed in the literature and have contributed to drastically improve the outcome of glycosylation analysis, as presented in the sampling surveyed in this review. As a current topic in 2020, glycoproteins carried by pathogens can also cause disease and this is seen with SARS CoV2, causing the COVID-19 pandemic. This review will discuss glycoproteomic studies of the spike glycoprotein and interacting proteins such as the ACE2 receptor.","Pujić, Ivona; Perreault, Hélène",Mass spectrometry reviews,https://doi.org/10.1002/mas.21679; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33393161/,134

79677,Medication Errors.,2018,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Novel angiographic grading scales for the assessment of intracranial aneurysms treated with flow-diverting stents have been recently developed because previous angiographic grading scales cannot be applied to these aneurysms. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the inter- and intraobserver variability of the novel O'Kelly Marotta grading scale, which was developed specifically for the angiographic assessment of aneurysms treated with flow-diverting stents. MATERIALS AND METHODS Multiple raters (n = 31) from the disciplines of neuroradiology and neurosurgery were presented with pre- and posttreatment angiographic images of 14 aneurysms treated with intraluminal flow diverters. Raters were asked to classify pre- and posttreatment angiograms by using the OKM grading scale. Statistical analyses were subsequently performed with calculation of a generalized multirater κ statistic for assessment of inter- and intraobserver variability and by performing a Wilcoxon signed rank sum test for assessment of group differences. RESULTS Variability analysis of the OKM grading scale yielded substantial (κ = 0.74) and almost perfect (κ = 0.99) inter- and intraobserver agreement, respectively, with no statistically significant differences between raters with a background of neuroradiology versus neurosurgery or attending physician versus trainee. CONCLUSIONS The OKM grading scale for the assessment of intracranial aneurysms treated with flow-diverting stents is a reliable grading scale that can be used equally well by users of varying backgrounds and levels of training. Comparison with interobserver variability of pre-existing angiographic grading scales shows equal or better performance.","Joshi, M D; O'Kelly, C J; Krings, T; Fiorella, D; Marotta, T R",AJNR.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the Pipeline Embolization Device in the treatment of recurrent, previously stented aneurysms. MATERIALS AND METHODS Twenty-one patients with previously stented recurrent aneurysms who later underwent Pipeline Embolization Device placement (group 1) were retrospectively identified and compared with 63 patients who had treatment with the Pipeline Embolization Device with no prior stent placement (group 2). Occlusion at the latest follow-up angiogram, recurrence and retreatment rates, clinical outcome, complications, and morbidity and mortality observed after treatment with the Pipeline Embolization Device were analyzed. RESULTS Patient characteristics were similar between the 2 groups. The mean time from stent placement to recurrence was 25 months. Pipeline Embolization Device treatment resulted in complete aneurysm occlusion in 55.6% of patients in group 1 versus 80.4% of patients in group 2 (P = .036). The retreatment rate in group 1 was 11.1% versus 7.1% in group 2 (P = .62). The rate of good clinical outcome at the latest follow-up in group 1 was 81% versus 93.2% in group 2 (P = .1). Complications were observed in 14.3% of patients in group 1 and 9.5% of patients in group 2 (P = .684). CONCLUSIONS The use of the Pipeline Embolization Device in the management of previously stented aneurysms is less effective than the use of this device in nonstented aneurysms.

This meta-analysis compared perioperative administration of desmopressin to placebo. Desmopressin reduced red cell transfusions, blood loss and risk of re-operation due to bleeding. There were too few events to determine if there was a change in the risk of thrombotic events. SUMMARY Background Platelet dysfunction, including that caused by antiplatelet agents, increases the risk of perioperative bleeding. The optimal management of patients with platelet dysfunction undergoing surgery is unclear. Objectives To assess whether desmopressin reduces perioperative allogeneic red cell transfusion and bleeding in patients with platelet dysfunction. Patients/Methods We searched for randomized controlled trials in The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, the Transfusion Evidence Library and the ISI Web of Science to 7th July 2016. Data were pooled using mean difference (MD), relative risks or Peto odds ratios (pOR) using a random-effects model. Results Ten trials with 596 participants were identified, all in the setting of cardiac surgery. Platelet dysfunction was due to antiplatelet agents in six trials and cardiopulmonary bypass in four trials. Patients treated with desmopressin were transfused with fewer red cells (MD, -0.65 units; 95% Confidence Interval [CI], -1.16 to -0.13 units), lost less blood (MD, -253.93 mL; 95% CI, -408.01 to -99.85 mL) and had a lower risk of re-operation due to bleeding (pOR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.18-0.84). The GRADE quality of evidence was very low to moderate, suggesting considerable uncertainty over the results Conclusions Desmopressin may be a useful agent to reduce bleeding and transfusion requirements for people with platelet dysfunction or with a history of recent antiplatelet drug administration undergoing cardiac surgery.","Desborough, M J R; Oakland, K A; Landoni, G; Crivellari, M; Doree, C; Estcourt, L J; Stanworth, S J",Journal of thrombosis and haemostasis : JTH,https://doi.org/10.1111/jth.13576; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27893176/,134

METHODS The COVID-19 Emergency Department (COVED) Project is an ongoing prospective cohort study in Australian EDs. This analysis presents data from twelve sites across four Australian states for the period from 1 July to 31 August 2020. All adult patients who met criteria for 'suspected COVID-19' and underwent testing for SARS-CoV-2 in the ED were eligible for inclusion. Study outcomes included a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result, mechanical ventilation and in-hospital mortality. RESULTS There were 106,136 presentations to the participating EDs and 12,055 (11.4%; 95% CI: 11.2-11.6) underwent testing for SARS-CoV-2. Of these, 255 (2%) patients returned a positive result. Among positive cases, 13 (5%) received mechanical ventilation during their hospital admission compared to 122 (2%) of the SARS-CoV-2 negative patients (OR 2.7; 95% CI: 1.5-4.9, p=0.001). Nineteen (7%) SARS-CoV-2 positive patients died in hospital compared to 212 (3%) of the SARS-CoV-2 negative patients (OR 2.3; 95% CI: 1.4-3.7, p=0.001). Strong clinical predictors of the SARS-CoV-2 test result included self-reported fever, sore throat, bilateral infiltrates on CXR, and absence of a leucocytosis on first ED blood tests (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS In this prospective multi-site study during Australia's 'second wave', a substantial proportion of ED presentations required SARS-CoV-2 testing and isolation.

80962,The relationship between intracranial pressure and obesity: an ultrasonographic evaluation of the optic nerve.,2016,"BACKGROUND Self-help organizations act in a self-determined manner, but can be strengthened by conducive framework conditions such as advanced training programs. The Austrian Competence and Service Agency for Self-help ÖKUSS was created as part of the framework of the concept for public promotion of self-help. It developed an advanced training program for the systematic support of nationwide self-help organizations (NSHO). The article describes the conceptual development of an advanced training program and discusses how to deal with ambivalences arising in the process. METHOD Three training tracks were derived from the objectives of the concept for the public promotion of self-help (promoting the visibility of self-help organizations, strengthening self-help organizations in their activities, and patient participation). To determine the contents, the advanced training needs of NSHO were identified on the basis of process-produced data (including feedback forms), relevant literature, and the results of workshops with self-help representatives. An Internet search was conducted to build on existing offerings. The ÖKUSS concept was developed in several workshops with representatives of self-help organizations and its contents and framework conditions were discussed. RESULTS Training Track 1 ""Strengthening self-help activities"" aims to strengthen the self-image of NSHO as a self-help organization and to support the implementation of activities with introductory seminars and additional workshops. Training Track 2 ""Promoting cooperation"" supports the meeting and dialogue between NSHO representatives and experts with expert dialogues and annual projects. Training Track 3 ""Strengthening collective patient participation"" prepares NSHO representatives for participation in health policy decision-making processes in a modular course. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS During the development process, ambivalences in a social, factual, time and space dimension were dealt with: On the social dimension, the aim was to take decisions regarding the objectives, form and content of the continuing education program as closely as possible to the participants and to offer low-threshold participation. On the factual level, the focus was on the competence of those affected and/or the transfer of competence for implementing activities. In terms of time, a balance had to be struck between the time resources available to the NSHO representatives and the time required to develop competence. In terms of space, on-site events were preferred to online events (before COVID-19). Finally, a different approach was chosen for each training track. For the further development of the advanced training program, a piloting and a participatory development with NSHO representatives is recommended.","Rojatz, Daniela","Zeitschrift fur Evidenz, Fortbildung und Qualitat im Gesundheitswesen",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.zefq.2021.03.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34034969/,134

Cepheid® GeneXpert® MRSA/SA PCR can be used to distinguish MRSA and MSSA from non-Staphylococcus aureus organisms in blood cultures. This study aims to determine if implementation of MRSA/SA PCR for blood culture pathogen identification, plus daily antimicrobial stewardship intervention, can reduce time to appropriate therapy, vancomycin duration, 30 day mortality, and 90 day recurrence in veterans. A total of 113 patients in the pre-implementation cohort and 73 patients in the post-implementation cohort were evaluated. Time to appropriate therapy was decreased from 49.8 (pre-implementation) to 20.6 (post-implementation) hours. There was a numerically shorter median duration of vancomycin therapy in the post-implementation group. There was no difference in 30 day mortality or 90 day recurrence between groups. Use of MRSA/SA PCR can improve antimicrobial use when combined with once-daily antimicrobial stewardship review.","Gritte, Anndee S; Morneau, Kathleen M; Frei, Christopher R; Cadena-Zuluaga, Jose A; Walter, Elizabeth A; Hopkins, Teri L",Diagnostic microbiology and infectious disease,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.diagmicrobio.2021.115474; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34352434/,134

STUDY DESIGN Cost analysis using a national database. SETTINGS The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) 2006 National Inpatient Sample. SUBJECTS AND METHODS We identified clinical manifestations and treatments of complications associated with endotracheal tubes and codified them into International Classification of Disease-ninth revision diagnosis and procedure codes, intentionally excluding alternative etiologies of tracheal injury. Using the AHRQ 2006 National Inpatient Sample, we then compared patients with tracheal injury coded during the medical or surgical stay for length of stay (LOS) and mean hospital cost with diagnosis-related group (DRG)-matched controls; we also examined readmissions treating tracheal injury. RESULTS Tracheal injury presents as tracheal stenosis, tracheomalacia, tracheoesophageal fistula, laryngotracheal ulceration, and vocal cord paralysis. A total of 3232 discharge records met criteria for tracheal injury from ETI within the index hospital stay. Average LOS for patients with tracheal injury (6.3 days; 95% confidence interval [CI] 6.0-6.3) exceeded LOS in the uncomplicated sample (5.2 days; CI 5.1-5.3) by 1.1 days. The average hospital cost was $1888 higher with tracheal injury ($10,375 [CI $9762-$10,988] vs $8487 [CI $8266-$8669]). LOS for procedures treating prior tracheal injury averaged 4.7 days and cost an average of $11,025 per discharge. CONCLUSION Tracheal injury from ETI is associated with a significant increase in healthcare costs that accrue both during the index admission and during subsequent hospitalizations required to treat the injury.","Bhatti, Nasir I; Mohyuddin, Atta; Reaven, Nancy; Funk, Susan E; Laeeq, Kulsoom; Pandian, Vinciya; Mirski, Marek; Feller-Kopman, David",Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.otohns.2009.11.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20620616/,134

METHODS All 192 patients treated with mechanical thrombectomy for acute ischemic stroke from September 2005 to December 2011 were included in this observational study. Main outcomes were independence, defined as a modified Rankin Scale score of 0-2, an improvement in stroke severity score post-thrombectomy, and the occurrence of symptomatic hemorrhage. Exposure variables were sex, age, intravenous thrombolysis, prethrombectomy stroke severity grading, pretreatment infarct size, time from onset of symptoms to groin puncture, thrombectomy device used, and the angiographic result from the thrombectomy. RESULTS For patients above 50 years with no neurological symptoms before stroke onset, the proportion gaining independence was unrelated to age group, ranging from 49% to 54%. For patients younger than 50 years of age, the proportion was significantly higher (81%). Patients with wake-up stroke did not differ from other patients with regard to outcome.

However, little is known regarding the in-care population. OBJECTIVE To find out how children in residential care perceived the influence of the COVID-19 lockdown in their everyday life, relationships and subjective well-being. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING 856 children from 10 to 17 years old (Mage = 15.5, males = 71.2%, females = 28.8%) living in residential centres in Catalonia. METHODS Cross-sectional study. Children responded to an on-line questionnaire administered between June and July 2020. Bivariate analysis and multiple linear regression were used comparing the answers by sex. RESULTS Better relationships with caregivers (β = 9.156, [4.089-14.22], r2 = 0.244, p < .01) and having a person of trust (ß = 4.588, [2.041-7.134], r2 = 0.244, p < .01) were found to be relevant for children's subjective well-being. For girls, improving their grades (β = 14.86, [8.560-21.15], r2 = 0.234, p < .01) were relevant while boys' subjective well-being was significantly affected by an increase in use of social networks (β = 8.917, [2.733-15.10], r2 = 0.234, p < .01). CONCLUSIONS A gender perspective is needed to help girls in situations of vulnerability.

RESULTS The proportion of moderate/severe anxiety was 31.3%, which showed significant association with working in sectors involving COVID-19 and directly with suspected/confirmed cases of COVID-19. During the multiple analysis, we found prevalence of anxiety in participants who needed psychological support after entering their residence and those who used psychotropic meds. CONCLUSION The results seem to indicate that residents had their mental health impaired during the pandemic, but the maintenance of the variables in the model also suggests that they sought help to control anxiety.","Dantas, Eder Samuel Oliveira; Araújo Filho, João de Deus de; Silva, Glauber Weder Dos Santos; Silveira, Maria Yohana Matias; Dantas, Marianny Nayara Paiva; Meira, Karina Cardoso",Revista brasileira de enfermagem,https://doi.org/10.1590/0034-7167-2020-0961; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33886846/,134
82833,Laparoendoscopic single-site simultaneous bilateral nephrectomy: first reported case series.,2021,"OBJECTIVE Health quarantines produce serious deterioration in psychological health, which becomes more affected the longer the quarantine lasts. According to the Conservation of Resources theory from Hobfoll (1989, American Psychologist, 44, 513), those people who have a good supply of resources will be able to cope better with the adversities and will show less distress. The objective of this research is to identify what are the resources that, in a situation of confinement under the threat of COVID-19, predict eustress or well-being, and the loss or lack of which resources predict distress or discomfort. DESIGN AND METHOD A total of 839 people complete an online questionnaire during the first week of COVID-19 confinement in Spain. The sample is weighted to obtain a distribution that is similar to the Spanish population. Using multiple linear regression analysis, factors are identified that are associated with eustress and distress based on the Conservation of Resources theory. RESULTS A model is identified that explains 55% of the variance of eustress consisting mostly of personal resources, with vitality as the recourse having the most weight. The factors that explain distress (18.9% of the variance) are those related to work (employment situation, work satisfaction, and time devoted to work) and conditions in the home (space). CONCLUSIONS The models that predict eustress and distress are completely different. Based on these results, a series of recommendations are proposed aimed at increasing eustress and reducing distress in a situation of confinement. Additionally, proposals are offered for future research.","Merino, M Dolores; Vallellano, M Dolores; Oliver, Coral; Mateo, Inmaculada",British journal of health psychology,https://doi.org/10.1111/bjhp.12501; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33400353/,134

The use of photodegradation catalysts is a promising avenue in resolving environmental issues and therefore high-performance photocatalysts are urgently needed. Herein, we solvothermally synthesized a micro-spherical g-C3N4 photocatalyst and a nanospherical Ni0.1Co0.9Fe2O4 photocatalyst, and then innovatively employed small amounts of Ni0.1Co0.9Fe2O4 nanospheres coupled with g-C3N4 microspheres to fabricate a novel magnetic Ni0.1Co0.9Fe2O4/g-C3N4 nano-micro-spherical heterojunction photocatalyst through post co-calcination. Various techniques, including scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy and UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, were employed to analyze the as-synthesized hybrid photocatalyst. The resultant photocatalyst exhibits a record high photocatalytic degradation activity against methylene blue under visible-light irradiation with a 100% degradation rate within only 10 min, corresponding to an extraordinarily prominent degradation reaction rate constant k value of up to 0.586 min-1.

83303,IBFAN News Brief: Breastfeeding Protection in the Time of Covid-19.,2021-02-01,"The disproportionately high rates of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) health complications and mortality among older adults prompted supportive public responses, such as special senior early shopping hours and penpal programs. Simultaneously, some older adults faced neglect and blatant displays of ageism (e.g., #BoomerRemover) and were considered the lowest priority to receive health care. This article examines positive and negative responses toward older adults in the United States during the pandemic and the consequences for older adults and society using data from the pandemic in the United States (and informed by data from other countries) as well as past theorizing and empirical research on views and treatment of older adults. Specifically, positive responses can reinforce the value of older adults, improve older adults' mental and physical health, reduce ageism, and improve intergenerational relations, whereas negative responses can have the opposite effects. However, positive responses (social distancing to protect older adults from COVID-19 infection) can inadvertently increase loneliness, depression, health problems, and negative stereotyping of older adults (e.g., helpless, weak). Pressing policy issues evident from the treatment of older adults during the pandemic include health care (triaging, elder abuse), employment (layoffs, retirement), and education about ageism, as well as the intersection of ageism with other forms of prejudice (e.g., racism) that cuts across these policies.

83460,Usefulness of laparoscopic surgery and preoperative examinations for chronic recurrent small bowel obstruction.,2021-01-10,"BACKGROUND The last 15 years have been characterized by a rapid expansion of minimally invasive surgery as treatment for adrenal diseases. During these years, both indications and surgical techniques have shown improvements. This study analyzed an 11-year single-center experience with laparoscopic adrenalectomy. MATERIALS AND METHODS Between January 1997 and April 2008, 242 laparoscopic adrenalectomies were performed in 220 patients at Rikshospitalet University Hospital. Of these, 192 patients were operated on for benign lesions, 23 for malignant lesions, and in 5 cases ""en bloc"" adrenalectomies were performed. Benign lesions included 136 hormonally active lesions (41 pheochromocytomas, 48 Conn adenomas, 25 Cushing adenomas, and 18 patients with Cushing's disease) and 56 with hormonally inactive lesions (among them, 47 nonfunctional adenomas). Malignant lesions included 16 adrenal metastases and 7 adrenocortical carcinomas. RESULTS All adrenalectomies were completed laparoscopically. The median time of unilatateral adrenalectomy was 85 (range, 35-325) minutes. The median blood loss was 0 (range, 0-1100) mL. There were 6 intraoperative and 7 postoperative minor complications. The number of complications did not differ between the types of adrenal pathology. Only 19% of the patients required opioids postoperatively. Per- and postoperative parameters were homogeneous among patients with different adrenal lesions. The patients with adrenocortical carcinoma had a distinctive intraoperative course with an evidently longer operative time and higher blood loss. The median postoperative hospital stay was 2 (range, 1-15) days. Hospital stay was the only postoperative parameter where a difference was found between patients with different adrenal lesions. The patients with carcinoma, pheochromocytoma, and Cushing's disease had the longest median postoperative stay, respectively, 5 (range, 2-6), 3 (range, 1-15), and 3 (range, 2-6) days. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic adrenalectomy is a safe, effective procedure providing improved fast and uncomplicated patient recovery independent of the type of adrenal lesion. Laparoscopic adrenalectomy can be easily introduced and may soon replace traditional open surgery in specialized centers.","Kazaryan, Airazat M; Marangos, Irina Pavlik; Rosseland, Arne R; Røsok, Bård I; Villanger, Olaug; Pinjo, Emir; Pfeffer, Per F; Edwin, Bjørn",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

RF ablation is most effective in tumors smaller than 4.0 cm. This report describes 5-year survival in patients with single tumors with a maximum diameter of 4 cm. MATERIALS AND METHODS Forty of 291 patients (14%; 24 men, 16 women; mean age, 67 years; age range, 34-86 y) with no or treated extrahepatic disease were identified who were not candidates for resection and who had a minimum follow-up of 6 months. Sixteen had undergone hepatic resection and two had undergone lung resection and lung ablation. Thirty-two (80%) received chemotherapy. Thirty-five were treated under general anesthesia and five under conscious sedation. Our standard ablation protocol used internally water-cooled electrodes introduced percutaneously with ultrasonography and computed tomography guidance and monitoring. Follow-up data were obtained from primary care physicians or oncologists. RESULTS Mean tumor diameter was 2.3 cm (range, 0.8-4.0 cm). There were two successfully treated systemic complications: a chest infection and an exacerbation of asthma. There were no local complications. Mean follow-up was 38 months (range, 6-132 months). The median survival duration and 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates were 59 months and 97%, 84%, 40%, respectively, after ablation; and 63 months, 100%, 88%, and 54%, respectively, from the diagnosis of liver metastases. History of liver resection did not impact survival. CONCLUSIONS RF ablation of solitary liver metastases 4 cm or smaller can be performed with minimal morbidity and results in excellent long-term survival, approaching that of surgical resection, even in patients who are not surgical candidates.","Gillams, Alice R; Lees, William R",Journal of vascular and interventional radiology : JVIR,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvir.2008.01.016; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18440460/,134

However, the potential threat of heat injury to adjacent structures if the hepatic lesion is near the diaphragm is often overlooked and misunderstood. Rare cardiovascular complications have been reported. How best to identify the patients at risk to allow for prompt treatment is an important issue. CASE PRESENTATION A 56-year-old man with underlying oral cancer received radiofrequency ablation for a metastatic liver tumor at segment II. Pleuritic chest pain developed on the day after radiofrequency catheter ablation. Diffuse ST elevation and echocardiography showed the new onset of small to moderate pericardial effusion without tamponade sign. Inflammatory markers were also elevated. Acute pericarditis due to heat penetration and stimulation was favored. His symptoms and signs resolved after treatment with anti-inflammatory medication. CONCLUSION Potential cardiovascular complications are possible after radiofrequency catheter ablation for liver tumors located at segment II. Artificial ascites with normal saline before radiofrequency ablation may separate the liver and diaphragm to prevent cardiac complications. During the procedure, electrocardiographic monitoring and close observation of the patient's symptom are required. Echocardiography can be used to confirm cardiac complications.","Hsu, Jung-Chi; Tsai, Han-Lin; Lin, Yu-Ling; Chang, Rei-Yeuh",BMC cardiovascular disorders,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12872-018-0937-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30348082/,134

Religion scholars argue that religion is multi-faceted and better understood by focusing on combinations of indicators (i.e. mosaics), versus a variable-centered approach. We adopt this framework and investigate the interplay between religion and peer networks, both in how religious mosaics are shaped by friends and how religious profiles affect friend selection dynamics. With data from two schools in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, we estimate religious mosaics using latent class analysis (LCA) to identify profiles consisting of combinations of commonly available survey-based measures of religious attitudes, behaviors, and identities. Finding evidence of theoretically-expected profiles, we then use stochastic actor based models (SABMs) to investigate network dynamics for these LCA-based religious profiles. We demonstrate how the profile data can be integrated within the SABM framework to evaluate processes of friend selection and influence. Results show evidence of adolescents influencing one another's religious mosaics, but not selecting friends on that basis.","Adams, Jimi; Schaefer, David R; Ettekal, Andrea Vest",Journal for the scientific study of religion,https://doi.org/10.1111/jssr.12638; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32831393/,134

We present our experience with a novel technique to improve continence outcomes in patients who are undergoing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP). PATIENTS AND METHODS A consecutive series of 159 patients after initiation of a bladder neck plication stitch was compared with the most recent group before the change. After completion of the vesicourethral anastomosis, a single suture was used to plicate the distal bladder neck. A structured questionnaire was used for follow-up. Continence criteria used were 1 pad per day for social continence and 0 pad per day for total continence. RESULTS A total of 334 patients were included in the study: 159 in the plication stitch group vs 175 in the control group. Average age was 59.1 vs 59.6 years, average body mass index was 27.9 vs 28.3 kg/m(2), and average prostate volume was 58.1 vs 60.9 cc, respectively. The mean time to reach social continence was 3.63±3.01 vs 5.33±4.89 weeks (P=0.004), and total continence was 5.10±3.80 vs 8.49±6.32 weeks (P=0.002), respectively. Chance of total continence improved with the bladder plication stitch: Odds ratio of 1.95±0.72 (P<0.001) at 1 month, 1.25±0.56 (P=0.113) at 3 months, and 2.07±0.66 (P=0.005) at 12 months. There were no bladder neck contractures or other urinary complications noted in either group. CONCLUSIONS The bladder plication stitch is a simple and effective technical modification for shortening the period of recovery of urinary continence in RARP patients. Randomized controlled trials are under way to further evaluate this technique.","Lee, David I; Wedmid, Alexei; Mendoza, Pierre; Sharma, Saurabh; Walicki, Mary; Hastings, Rachel; Monahan, Kelly; Eun, Daniel",Journal of endourology,https://doi.org/10.1089/end.2011.0279; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21942755/,134

Paragonimiasis is one of the most important food-borne parasitic zoonoses caused by the trematode of the genus Paragonimus. Although hepatic paragonimiasis is rare, the previous studies had investigated hepatic paragonimiasis from different perspectives. However, the safety and feasibility of laparoscopic major hepatectomy for hepatic paragonimiasis have not yet been reported in the literature. METHODS We here present 2 cases of hepatic paragonimiasis at the deep parts of the liver with treatment by laparoscopic major hepatectomy. One case is a 32-year-old male patient who was admitted to the hospital due to upper abdominal discomfort without fever for 1 month. The clinical imaging revealed that there was a lesion about 5.9 × 3.7 cm in the boundary of right anterior lobe and right posterior lobe of the liver with rim enhancement and tract-like nonenhanced areas. The other one is a 62-year-old female patient who was referred to the hospital for 1 month of right upper abdominal pain and fever. The ultrasonography showed that there was a huge hypoechoic mass (about 10.8 × 6.3 cm) in middle lobe of the liver with tract-like nonenhanced areas. Both patients were from an endemic area of paragonimiasis and the proportion of eosinophil in the second case was increased. RESULTS The preoperative diagnosis of the first case was ambiguous and the hepatic paragonimiasis was considered for the second case. The first case underwent laparoscopic extended right posterior lobe hepatectomy and the other case underwent laparoscopic extended left hemihepatectomy. Both operations went very well and the operation times for the 2 cases were 275 minutes and 310 minutes, respectively. The 2 patients' postoperative recovery was smooth without major postoperative complications (such as, bleeding, bile leakage, and liver failure). Moreover, the 2 patients were discharged on the 6th day and 7th day after surgery, respectively. The postoperative histopathological examination manifested hepatic paragonimiasis in both patients. CONCLUSION This study suggests that the laparoscopic approach may be safe and technically feasible for hepatic paragonimiasis.","Liu, Fei; Zhang, Jingyi; Lei, Chuanfen; Wei, Yonggang; Li, Bo",Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000004939; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27661049/,134
85613,Open mini-flank partial nephrectomy: an essential contemporary operation.,2014,"OBJECTIVES To assess tooth discoloration induced by different hydraulic calcium silicate-based cements (HCSCs), including effects of blood and placement method. MATERIALS AND METHODS Eighty bovine teeth cut to a length of 18 mm (crown 8 mm, root 10 mm) were randomly assigned to 10 groups (n = 8), receiving orthograde apical plug treatment (APT). Apical plugs were 4 mm in length and made of ProRoot MTA (Dentsply), Medcem MTA (Medcem), TotalFill BC RRM Fast Set Putty (Brasseler), or Medcem Medical Portland Cement (Medcem) plus bismuth oxide (Bi2O3) with and without bovine blood. Further, orthograde (with or without preoperative adhesive coronal dentin sealing) and retrograde APT were compared. Teeth were obturated with gutta-percha and sealer, sealed with composite and stored in distilled water. Tooth color was measured on apical plug, gutta-percha/sealer, and crown surface before treatment versus 24 h, 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after treatment by spectrophotometry. Color difference (ΔE) values were calculated and analyzed by Shapiro-Wilk test, ANOVA with post hoc tests, Friedman test, t test, and post hoc tests with Bonferroni correction (α = .05). RESULTS Tooth discoloration occurred in all groups with no significant differences between HCSCs (p > .05). After 24 months, color changes were prominent on roots but insignificant on crowns. Blood contamination induced a significantly decreased luminescence (p < .05). Blood had a stronger impact on tooth color than Bi2O3. No relevant effects of retrograde placement (p > .05) or preoperative dentin sealing (p > .05) were detected. CONCLUSIONS Apical plugs of the tested HCSCs cause discoloration of bovine roots, but not discoloration of bovine tooth crowns within a 24-month period. CLINICAL RELEVANCE APT should be performed carefully while avoiding direct contact with the coronal dentin, and in that case no aesthetic impairments occur.","Krug, Ralf; Ortmann, C; Reich, S; Hahn, B; Krastl, G; Soliman, S",Clinical oral investigations,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00784-021-04009-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34151389/,134
86281,Minimally invasive nephron-sparing surgery for unilateral Wilms tumor.,2012,"BACKGROUND : Transthyretin amyloid polyneuropathy (ATTR-PN) is a fatal disease associated with substantial burden of illness. Three therapies are approved by the European Medicines Agency for the management of this rare disease. The aim of this study was to compare the total annual treatment specific cost per-patient associated with ATTR-PN in Spain. METHODS An Excel-based patient burden and cost estimator tool was developed to itemize direct and indirect costs related to treatment with inotersen, patisiran, and tafamidis in the context of ATTR-PN. The product labels and feedback from five Spanish ATTR-PN experts were used to inform resource use and cost inputs. RESULTS Marked differences in costs were observed between the three therapies. The need for patisiran- and inotersen-treated patients to visit hospitals for pre-treatment, administration, and monitoring was associated with increased patient burden and costs compared to those treated with tafamidis. Drug acquisition costs per-patient per-year were 291,076€ (inotersen), 427,250€ (patisiran) and 129,737€ (tafamidis) and accounted for the majority of total costs. Overall, the total annual per-patient costs were lowest for patients treated with tafamidis (137,954€), followed by inotersen (308,358€), and patisiran (458,771€). CONCLUSIONS Treating patients with tafamidis leads to substantially lower costs and patient burden than with inotersen or patisiran.","Galan, Lucia; Gonzalez-Moreno, Juan; Martínez-Sesmero, José Manuel; Muñoz-Beamud, Francisco; Santos-Rubio, Maria Dolores; Tran, Diana; Lebeau, Paul; Stewart, Michelle; Mallaina, Pablo; Tarilonte, Patricia; Peral, Carmen; Rozenbaum, Mark",Expert review of pharmacoeconomics & outcomes research,https://doi.org/10.1080/14737167.2021.1900738; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33724140/,134

However, the most common causes of colds are human rhinoviruses, which infect the epithelial cells of the nasopharynx. Moreover, after decades of research, the best documented method of preventing infection remains to be handwashing. However, stopping people from inadvertently touching or rubbing one's nose and eyes is difficult, and the effectiveness of preventing such habits has not been validated. Here, we reported the results of a randomized controlled trial (n = 120) performed over 50 days. We examined the effectiveness of using smartwatches equipped with a sensor and a vibration alert, as well as the self-checking of behavior, in preventing subjects from touching their nose or eyes. Participants were randomly assigned to either the smartwatch group or the handwashing group (control). Subjects in the handwashing group were requested to wash their hands after going out, whereas subjects in the smartwatch group were requested to wash their hands and in addition wear a smartwatch that vibrates to remind them not to excessively touch their nose or eyes. The daily frequency of nose and eye touching was also recorded by the smartwatches. The first incidence of an upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) was the primary endpoint. In the smartwatch group, compared with the control group, the incidence of URTIs was significantly lower by 53% (p < 0.05) and was associated with a decrease in the mean frequency of nose or eye touching (p < 0.05).","Maeda, Atsuhiko",Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

86780,Resident learning curve for laparoscopic appendectomy according to seniority.,2020-02-14,"OBJECTIVE Fractional tissue oxygen extraction (FTOE) is a measure derived from cerebral near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and simultaneous pulse oximetry (SpO2), capturing the proportion of oxygen delivered in arterial blood that is used by the target tissue. FTOE may provide a better proxy measurement of retinal hyperoxia than pulse oximetry alone and could provide insight into the risk for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). In this study, we directly compared hyperoxia burden calculated from FTOE with hyperoxia burden calculated from SpO2 alone in order to assess the strength of association between hyperoxia and severe ROP. STUDY DESIGN Infants born before <30 weeks and weighing <1500 g underwent synchronized SpO2 and FTOE recording over the first 4 days following birth. After error correction of the raw recording, hyperoxia burden was calculated as the percentage of the total SpO2 or FTOE recording with measurements exceeding defined thresholds (90/93/95% and 20/15/10%, respectively) and was compared with the outcome of severe ROP, defined as ROP requiring laser therapy, after controlling for important covariates. RESULT A total of 63 infants were included with a mean±s.d. gestational age of 25.8±1.5 weeks and birth weight of 898.5±206.9 g; 13/63 (20%) had severe ROP. SpO2 hyperoxia burden was not associated with severe ROP at any threshold. FTOE hyperoxia burden was associated with severe ROP at the 15% (P=0.04) and 10% (P=0.03) thresholds. Infants with severe ROP spent 20% and 50% more time exceeding the 15% and 10% thresholds, respectively, as compared with those without severe ROP. CONCLUSION In the first 96 h of life, FTOE but not SpO2 hyperoxia burden is associated with severe ROP. These preliminary results suggest that NIRS may be a viable alternative technology for targeted oxygen saturation guidelines.","Vesoulis, Z A; Lust, C E; Liao, S M; Trivedi, S B; Mathur, A M",Journal of perinatology : official journal of the California Perinatal Association,https://doi.org/10.1038/jp.2016.131; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27559717/,134
86921,Risk factors for prolonged ileus following colon surgery.,2016,"Infection segmentation on chest CT plays an important role in the quantitative analysis of COVID-19. Developing automatic segmentation tools in a short period with limited labelled images has become an urgent need. Pseudo label-based semi-supervised method is a promising way to leverage unlabelled data to improve segmentation performance. Existing methods usually obtain pseudo labels by first training a network with limited labelled images and then inferring unlabelled images. However, these methods may generate obviously inaccurate labels and degrade the subsequent training process. To address these challenges, in this paper, an active contour regularized semi-supervised learning framework is proposed to automatically segment infections with few labelled images. The active contour regularization is realized by the region-scalable fitting (RSF) model which is embedded to the loss function of the network to regularize and refine the pseudo labels of the unlabelled images. We further design a splitting method to separately optimize the RSF regularization term and the segmentation loss term with convolution-thresholding method (ICTM) and stochastic gradient descent, respectively, which enable fast optimization of each term. Furthermore, we build a statistical atlas to show the infection spatial distribution. Extensive experiments on a small public dataset and a large scale dataset show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods with up to 5\% in DSC and NSD, 10\% in RAVD and $8mm$ in 95\% HD. Moreover, we observe that the infections tend to occur at the dorsal subpleural lung and posterior basal segments that are not mentioned in current radiology reports and are meaningful to advance our understanding of COVID-19.","Ma, Jun; Nie, Ziwei; Wang, Congcong; Dong, Guoqiang; Zhu, Qiongjie; He, Jian; Gui, Luying; Yang, Xiaoping",Physics in medicine and biology,https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6560/abc04e; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33045699/,134

The characters of this technique are evaluated. MATERIALS AND METHODS From October 2015 to April 2016, 18 consecutive patients with esophageal cancer were treated with Ivor Lewis MIE by a SICS group. Moreover, from July 2014 to September 2015, 48 patients with esophageal cancer received Ivor Lewis MIE by four-port video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) approach. Among those patients, by using propensity-score matching, 18 matched patients who underwent four-port VATS MIE (four-port group) were retrospectively selected for further statistical analysis. Patient demographics, short-term postoperative outcomes were recorded. RESULTS None of the patients in the SICS group required conversion to an open procedure. No failure of the intrathoracic esophagogastrostomy occurred. No perioperative mortality or readmission was observed in this series. No patient suffered from anastomotic leak or complained remarkable dysphasia during follow-up. SICS group had a shorter duration of both docking procedure and closure of chest incisions compared with four-port group. The visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores on 24 hours after surgery was significantly lower in SICS group than in four-port group, while the values on 6 hours were comparable. The level of creatine kinase on postoperative day (POD) 1 was significantly lower in SICS group than in four-port group. CONCLUSION Single intercostal space thoracoscopic procedure is safe and technically feasible and can therefore be viewed as an attractive alternative approach for performing Ivor Lewis MIE.","Pan, Saibo; Wang, Lian; Wu, Ming; Wang, Qi; Shen, Gang; Chen, Gang",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

88003,Minimally Invasive Approaches to the Surgical Management of Fibroids.,2017,"PURPOSE To describe an in vitro blood-perfused bovine liver model for the testing of radiofrequency (RF) ablation devices and compare the performance of a specific RF ablation device in the model relative to three other biologic models. MATERIALS AND METHODS Fresh bovine livers were used to create three in vitro models: blood-perfused, Krebs-Henseleit (KH) solution-perfused, and nonperfused. The perfused models were connected to a heart-lung machine via the portal vein and perfused with heparinized autologous blood or KH solution under physiologic conditions. Six swine were used as in vivo liver models. A cluster electrode and RF ablation system was operated in impedance mode for 12 minutes in all models. Ablated livers were sectioned, with long- and short-axis measurements of the ablations obtained, and statistical analysis was performed. RESULTS A total of 39, 23, 17, and 12 ablations were performed in 14, 6, 5, and 6 blood-perfused bovine livers, KH solution-perfused bovine livers, nonperfused bovine livers, and in vivo porcine livers, respectively. On cut specimens, the average diameters of ablation zones were 4.00 cm (95% CI, 3.88-4.13) in blood-perfused livers, 4.34 cm (95% CI, 4.14-4.50) in KH solution-perfused livers, 4.67 cm (95% CI, 4.50-4.83) in nonperfused livers, and 3.56 cm (95% CI, 3.26-3.83) in in vivo porcine livers. In all models, the ablation zone diameters were normally distributed. CONCLUSIONS In the in vitro blood-perfused bovine liver model, the size of ablations produced by an RF ablation device are closer in size to those seen in porcine liver in vivo compared with the lesions produced in KH solution-perfused or nonperfused bovine liver.","Orsi, Michael D; Dodd, Gerald D; Cardan, Rex A; Head, Hayden W; Burns, Stephanie K; Blakemore, Dana; Blume, Jeffrey; Green, Tyler J",Journal of vascular and interventional radiology : JVIR,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvir.2011.06.013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21802317/,134

Herein, we develop a monotargeting peptidic network antibody (pepnetibody) that blocks multiple receptors on the membrane of ECs through forming a fibrous network and ultimately achieves high-efficient treatment of CNV. The pepnetibody could bind to integrin αvβ3 in particulate formulation and in situ fibrillogenesis on ECs, mimicking the process of fibronectin fibrillogenesis on the cell membrane. The in situ formed peptidic network could firmly block integrin and cover other angiogenesis-related receptors, such as VEGF receptor-2 and neuropilin-1, exhibiting competitive efficacy of antiangiogenesis compared with traditional monoclonal antibody bevacizumab with 97.7 times lower dose.","Zhang, Kuo; Zhang, Hui; Gao, Yong-Hong; Wang, Jia-Qi; Li, Yuan; Cao, Hui; Hu, Ying; Wang, Lei",ACS nano,https://doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.1c02194; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34323463/,134

OBJECTIVE To evaluate the efficacy and safety of pactimibe in inhibition of atherosclerosis. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS A prospective, randomized, stratified, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (Carotid Atherosclerosis Progression Trial Investigating Vascular ACAT Inhibition Treatment Effects [CAPTIVATE]) of 892 patients heterozygous for familial hypercholesterolemia conducted at 40 lipid clinics in the United States, Canada, Europe, South Africa, and Israel between February 1, 2004, and December 31, 2005. Study was terminated on October 26, 2005. INTERVENTION Participants received either 100 mg/d of pactimibe (n = 443) or matching placebo (n = 438), in addition to standard lipid-lowering therapy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Carotid atherosclerosis, assessed by ultrasound carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT), at baseline, 12, 18, and 24 months. Maximum CIMT was the primary end point and mean CIMT the secondary end point. RESULTS Because pactimibe failed to show efficacy in the intravascular coronary ultrasound ACTIVATE study, the CAPTIVATE study was terminated prematurely after a follow-up of 15 months. After 6 months of treatment with pactimibe, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol increased by 7.3% (SD, 23%) compared with 1.4% (SD, 28%) in the placebo group (P = .001). The carotid ultrasonographic scans of the 716 patients with at least 2 scans and obtained at least 40 weeks apart were analyzed. Maximum CIMT measurements did not show a pactimibe treatment effect (difference, 0.004 mm; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.023 to 0.015 mm; P = .64); however, the less variable mean CIMT measurement revealed an increase of 0.014 mm (95% CI, -0.027 to 0.000 mm; P = .04) in patients administered pactimibe vs placebo. Major cardiovascular events (cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and stroke) occurred more often in patients administered pactimibe vs placebo (10/443 [2.3%] vs 1/438 [0.2%]; P = .01). CONCLUSIONS In patients with familial hypercholesterolemia, pactimibe had no effect on atherosclerosis as assessed by changes in maximum CIMT compared with placebo but was associated with an increase in mean CIMT as well as increased incidence of major cardiovascular events.

Among acquired DHs, up to 80% are left-sided, only a few iatrogenic DHs have been reported, and bilateral hernias are extremely rare. For diagnostic reasons, many DHs are overlooked by ultrasonography or X-ray and are only recognized at a later stage when complications occur. METHODS In 2009, we performed three partial diaphragm replacements in our clinic for repairing DHs using a PERMACOL™ implant. RESULTS As all patients had uneventful postoperative courses and the clinical outcomes were very good, we present one special case of a 65-year-old male with a giant iatrogenic bilateral DH with an enterothorax. CONCLUSION We see a good indication for diaphragm replacements by using a PERMACOL™ implant for fixing especially DHs with huge hernial gaps and in cases with fragile tissue.","Lingohr, Philipp; Galetin, Thomas; Vestweber, Boris; Matthaei, Hanno; Kalff, Jörg C; Vestweber, Karl-Heinz",International medical case reports journal,https://doi.org/10.2147/imcrj.s54361; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24600251/,134

Porcine bufaviruses (PoBuV) were first detected in Hungarian pig farms in 2016. To determine the prevalence and genetic diversity of PoBuV in China, we developed SYBR Green-based real-time PCR assays to detect PoBuV in Guangxi pigs. Real-time PCR detected PoBuV in 30 (29.13%, 30/103) of the samples with diarrhoeal intestinal tissues and rectal swabs. PoBuV-positive intestinal tissues and rectal swabs samples, co-infection with PEDV (15/30, 50.0%), followed by PDCoV (8/30, 26.67%), PoRV (6/30, 20.0%), PRRSV (5/30, 16.67%), and PCV2 (3/30, 10.0%) were observed. Fourteen complete genomes were cloned and sequenced. The results showed that they were 4189 bp in length and combined three open reading frames (ORFs) in the order 5'-NS1-VP1/VP2-3'. Fourteen strains shared 96.5%-99.8% identity among themselves and 92.7%-97.9% with the PoBuV reference sequences. Phylogenetic analysis based on the deduced amino acid sequence of the VP2 gene showed fourteen strains belonging to PoBuV and were grouped into the three branches. These results help to provide new insight into the molecular epidemiology of PoBuV in the world.","Huang, Haixin; Li, Yuying; Wang, Wei; Zheng, Min; Cao, Liang; Sun, Wenchao; Lu, Huijun","Infection, genetics and evolution : journal of molecular epidemiology and evolutionary genetics in infectious diseases",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2020.104286; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32171841/,134

Replication takes place in association with cytoplasmic membranes, which are heavily modified to create specific replication compartments. Here we have expressed by plasmid DNA transfection the large replicase polyprotein of Semliki Forest virus (SFV) in mammalian cells from a nonreplicating mRNA and provided a separate RNA containing the replication signals. The replicase proteins were able to efficiently and specifically replicate the template in trans, leading to accumulation of RNA and marker gene products expressed from the template RNA. The replicase proteins and double-stranded RNA replication intermediates localized to structures similar to those seen in SFV-infected cells. Using correlative light electron microscopy (CLEM) with fluorescent marker proteins to relocate those transfected cells, in which active replication was ongoing, abundant membrane modifications, representing the replication complex spherules, were observed both at the plasma membrane and in intracellular endolysosomes. Thus, replication complexes are faithfully assembled and localized in the trans-replication system. We demonstrated, using CLEM, that the replication proteins alone or a polymerase-negative polyprotein mutant together with the template did not give rise to spherule formation. Thus, the trans-replication system is suitable for cell biological dissection and examination in a mammalian cell environment, and similar systems may be possible for other positive-strand RNA viruses.","Spuul, Pirjo; Balistreri, Giuseppe; Hellström, Kirsi; Golubtsov, Andrey V; Jokitalo, Eija; Ahola, Tero",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00085-11; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21389137/,134
93050,Breastfeeding and COVID-19 Vaccine: Yes We Can.,2021-03-16,"Cocaine-induced stroke is among the most serious medical complications associated with cocaine's abuse. However, the extent to which chronic cocaine may induce silent microischemia predisposing the cerebral tissue to neurotoxicity has not been investigated; in part, because of limitations of current neuroimaging tools, that is, lack of high spatiotemporal resolution and sensitivity to simultaneously measure cerebral blood flow (CBF) in vessels of different calibers quantitatively and over a large field of view (FOV). Optical coherence tomography (OCT) technique allows us to image three dimensional (3D) cerebrovascular network (including artery, vein, and capillary), and provides high resolution angiography of the cerebral vasculature and quantitative CBF velocity (CBFv) within the individual vessels in the network. In order to monitor the neurovascular changes from an in vivo brain along with the chronic cocaine exposure, we have developed an approach of implanting a cranial window on mouse brain to achieve long-term cortical imaging. The cranial window was implanted on sensorimotor cortex area in two animal groups, i.e., control group [saline treatment, ~0.1 cc/10 g/day, intraperitoneal injection (i.p.)] and chronic cocaine group (cocaine treatment, 30 mg/kg/day i.p.). After implantation, the cortex of individual animal was periodically imaged by OCT and stereoscope to provide angiography and quantitative CBFv of the cerebral vascular network, as well as the surface imaging of the brain. We have observed vascular hemodynamic changes (i.e., CBFv changes) induced by the cranial preparation in both animal groups, including the inflammatory response of brain shortly after the surgery (i.e., <5 days) followed by wound-healing process (i.e., >5 days) in the brain. Importantly, by comparing with the control animals, the surgical-related vascular physiology changes in the cortex can be calibrated, so that the cocaine-induced hemodynamic changes in the neurovasculature can be determined in the cocaine animals. Our results demonstrate that this methodology can be used to explore the neurovascular functional changes induced by the brain diseases such as drug addiction.","Park, Kicheon; You, Jiang; Du, Congwu; Pan, Yingtian",Quantitative imaging in medicine and surgery,https://doi.org/10.3978/j.issn.2223-4292.2014.11.31; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25694959/,134

This study compares secondary post tonsillectomy haemorrhage rates between two operative techniques: diathermy tonsillectomy and diathermy tonsillectomy with tonsillar bed oversew. A total of 424 patients underwent tonsillectomies with or without other procedures such as adenoidectomy and grommet insertion by two ears, nose and throat surgeons at three hospitals from May 2012 to July 2013. A diathermy tonsillectomy was performed in 266 patients, while a diathermy tonsillectomy with tonsillar bed oversew was performed in 158 patients. All patients were followed up within 2-4 weeks of surgery. Primary haemorrhage did not occur in either surgical technique groups. Secondary haemorrhage occurred in 20 patients (7.52 %) in the diathermy tonsillectomy group and in 9 patients (5.70 %) in the diathermy with tonsillar bed oversew group. This result was not significantly different (OR = 0.74, 95 % CI 0.33-1.67, p = 0.47). Sex, age, indication for surgery and whether or not a tonsillectomy was performed alone or with other procedures were not significant factors for secondary haemorrhage. In summary, routine tonsillar bed oversew after diathermy tonsillectomy does not reduce the risk of secondary tonsillar haemorrhage.","Nguyen, Thomas B V; Chin, Ronald Y; Paramaesvaran, Suchitra; Eslick, Guy D",European archives of oto-rhino-laryngology : official journal of the European Federation of Oto-Rhino-Laryngological Societies (EUFOS) : affiliated with the German Society for Oto-Rhino-Laryngology - Head and Neck Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00405-014-3075-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24792067/,134

It identifies the different phases of a pandemic and the implications for capacity and mutual aid within a national healthcare system, and introduces a revised CRITCON-PANDEMIC framework for shared operational responsibilities and clinical decision-making. Usual legal and ethical frameworks should continue to apply while capacity and mutual aid are available (CRITCON-PANDEMIC levels 0-3); clinicians should focus on current clinical needs and should not treat patients differently because of anticipated future pressures. In conditions of resource limitation (CRITCON-PANDEMIC 4), a structured and equitable approach is necessary and an objective Decision Support Aid is proposed. In producing this guidance, we emphasise that all patients must be treated with respect and without discrimination, because everyone is of equal value. The guidance has been put together with input from patient and public groups and aims to provide standards that are fair to everyone. We acknowledge that COVID-19 is a new disease with a partial and evolving knowledge base, and aim to provide an objective clinical decision-making framework based on the best available information. It is recognised that a factual assessment of likely benefit may take into account age, frailty and comorbidities, but the guidance emphasises that every assessment must be individualised on a balanced, case by case, basis and may inform clinical judgement but not replace it. The effects of a comorbidity on someone's ability to benefit from critical care should be individually assessed. Measures of frailty should be used with care, and should not disadvantage those with stable disability.","Montgomery, J; Stokes-Lampard, H J; Griffiths, M D; Gardiner, D; Harvey, D; Suntharalingam, G",Journal of the Intensive Care Society,https://doi.org/10.1177/1751143720948537; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34422102/,134

METHODS Enrolled patients were randomly assigned to a single- or three-port surgery group. Scar-related outcomes were evaluated at 1 month, 6 months and 1 year. Scars were assessed by an independent observer using the modified Vancouver Scar Scale (mVSS). All patients were asked about pain related to the scar and scar satisfaction; results were recorded using a numerical rating scale. RESULTS Seventy-three patients were enrolled between June 2010 and June 2011. Demographic and surgical outcomes did not differ between the groups. mVSS results were similar in the two groups at each follow-up point. The scar satisfaction profile measured at 1 month showed no significant difference between the groups, but the single-port access group had better results than the conventional group at all other follow-up timepoints.

Long term outcomes are unknown. This study aims to investigate recovery of loss of smell and the prevalence of parosmia. METHODOLOGY 6-month follow-up of respondents to an online surgery who self-reported loss of smell at the onset of the CO- VID-19 pandemic in the UK. Information of additional symptoms, recovery of loss of smell and the development of parosmia was collected. RESULTS 44% of respondents reported at least one other ongoing symptom at 6 months, of which fatigue (n=106) was the most prevalent. There was a significant improvement in self-rating of severity of olfactory loss where 177 patients stated they had a normal smell of smell while 12 patients reported complete loss of smell. The prevalence of parosmia is 43.1% with median interval of 2.5 months (range 0-6) from the onset of loss of smell. CONCLUSIONS While many patients recover quickly, some experience long-term deficits with no self-reported improvement at 6 months. Furthermore, there is a high prevalence of parosmia even in those who report at least some recovery of olfactory func- tion. Longer term evaluation of recovery is required.","Hopkins, C; Surda, P; Vaira, L A; Lechien, J R; Safarian, M; Saussez, S; Kumar, N",Rhinology,https://doi.org/10.4193/rhin20.544; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33320115/,134

PATIENTS AND METHODS Patient selection was performed during a preoperative clinic visit. Cases where we estimated during preoperative assessment that warm ischaemia time would be >30 min, as determined by whether the patient had a complex renal mass, were selected. The special equipment required for this procedure includes an Ecolab Hush Slush machine (Microtek Medical Inc., Columbus, MS, USA) a Mon-a-therm needle thermocouple device (Covidien, Mansfield, MA, USA) and six modified 20-mL syringes. Patients are arranged in a 60° modified flank position with the operating table flexed slightly at the level of the anterior superior iliac spine. For the introduction of a temperature probe and ice slush, an additional 12-mm trocar is placed along the mid-axillary line beneath the costal margin. Modified 10/20 mL syringes are prefilled with ice slush for instillation via an accessory trocar. Peri-operative and 6-month functional outcomes in the cold ischaemia group were compared with those of a cohort of patients who underwent RAPN with warm ischaemia in a 2:1 matched fashion. Matching was performed based on preoperative estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR), ischaemia time and RENAL nephrometry score. RESULTS Strategies for successful intracorporeal renal cooling include: (i) placement of accessory port directly over the kidney; (ii) uniform ice consistency and modified syringes; (iii) sequential clamping of renal artery and vein; (iv) protection of the neighbouring intestine with a laparoscopic sponge; and (v) complete mobilization of the kidney. Kidney temperature is monitored via a needle thermocoupler device, while core body temperature is concurrently monitored via an oesophageal probe in real time. Renal function was assessed by serum creatinine level, estimated GFR (eGFR) and mercaptoacetyltriglycine (MAG-3) renal scan, peri-operatively and at 6-month follow-up. In the separate matched analysis, cold ischaemia during RAPN was found to be associated with a 12.9% improvement in preservation of postoperative eGFR. No difference was seen in either group at 6-month follow-up. CONCLUSIONS We conclude that RAPN with intracorporeal renal hypothermia using ice slush is technically feasible and may improve postoperative renal function in the short term. Our technique for intracorporeal hypotheramia is cost-effective, simple and highly reproducible.","Ramirez, Daniel; Caputo, Peter A; Krishnan, Jayram; Zargar, Homayoun; Kaouk, Jihad H",BJU international,https://doi.org/10.1111/bju.13346; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26435486/,134

Due to the pharmacokinetic (PK) characteristics of ER opioids and additional clinical advantages, the use of ER opioids for patients with moderate-to-severe chronic noncancer pain has increased. Primary care physicians are the major prescribers of opioids and require an in-depth understanding of the risks and benefits of opioid treatment in pain management. With appropriate knowledge of PK profiles and clinical outcomes of commonly prescribed ER opioids, primary care physicians can safely and effectively manage this patient population. In addition, the development of ER opioids with abuse-deterrent features marks an important milestone in potentially reducing abuse and may be factored into the clinical decision-making process.

For decades there has been widespread interest in understanding the mechanisms that drive this migratory process in response to different pathogens and organ systems. This has led to the successful integration of key findings on neutrophil transepithelial migration from the intestines, lungs, liver, genitourinary tract, and other tissues into a single, cohesive model. However, recent studies have identified organ specific differences in neutrophil transepithelial migration. These findings support a model where the tissue in concert with the pro-inflammatory stimuli dictate a unique collection of signals that drive neutrophil trafficking. This review focuses on the mechanisms that drive neutrophil transepithelial migration in response to microbial infection of a single organ, the lung. Herein we provide a detailed analysis of the adhesion molecules and chemoattractants that contribute to the recruitment of neutrophil into the airways.

94299,Using veterinary expertise.,2020-09-05,"INTRODUCTION The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in reconfiguration of the NHS. Elective services were stopped and trauma services focused on decreasing patient-clinician interactions and managing injuries nonoperatively wherever possible. The everyday life of the general public changed dramatically with the introduction of a national lockdown to prevent the spread of COVID-19. This paper looks at the experience of a South West London trauma unit. MATERIALS AND METHODS All patients reviewed in fracture clinic and by the orthopaedic on-call team between 23 March to 23 April 2020 were included. Data on the mechanism of injury and whether this was a usual activity, the injury sustained and its management were collected. RESULTS A total of 167 trauma injuries were seen, compared with 735 new patients with injuries in the previous month. The number of trauma operations completed decreased by 38%; 55% of injuries occurred inside the home and 44% outside the home during daily exercise. Some 31% of injuries were secondary to a new activity taken up during lockdown. Three open fractures and two polytrauma cases were seen that would have normally been managed at the local major trauma centre. CONCLUSION Overall, both the number of injuries seen and trauma operations completed during the enforced lockdown decreased. This is probably due to a change in the way the general public are living their lives, and the reconfigurations within the NHS in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This is an interesting time within trauma and orthopaedic departments, as they continue to adapt to the changing injuries and working environment.","Oliver-Welsh, L; Richardson, C; Ward, D A",Annals of the Royal College of Surgeons of England,https://doi.org/10.1308/rcsann.2020.7066; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33645278/,134

In this study the incidence of renal artery and parenchymal changes, assessed with contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) after RDN, is investigated. METHODS This study is an initiative of ENCOReD, a collaboration of hypertension expert centres. Patients in whom an MRA was performed before and after RDN were included. Scans were evaluated by two independent, blinded radiologists. Primary outcome was the change in renal artery morphology and parenchyma. RESULTS MRAs from 96 patients were analysed. Before RDN, 41 renal anomalies were observed, of which 29 mostly mild renal artery stenoses. After a median time of 366 days post RDN, MRA showed a new stenosis (25-49% lumen reduction) in two patients and progression of pre-existing lumen reduction in a single patient. No other renal changes were observed and renal function remained stable. CONCLUSIONS We observed new or progressed renal artery stenosis in three out of 96 patients, after a median time of 12 months post RDN (3.1%). Procedural angiographies showed that ablations were applied near the observed stenosis in only one of the three patients. KEY POINTS • The incidence of vascular changes 12 months post RDN was 3.1%. • No renal vascular or parenchymal changes other than stenoses were observed. • Ablations were applied near the stenosis in only one of three patients.","Sanders, Margreet F; van Doormaal, Pieter Jan; Beeftink, Martine M A; Bots, Michiel L; Fadl Elmula, Fadl Elmula M; Habets, Jesse; Hammer, Frank; Hoffmann, Pavel; Jacobs, Lotte; Mark, Patrick B; Persu, Alexandre; Renkin, Jean; Roditi, Giles; Spiering, Wilko; Staessen, Jan A; Taylor, Alison H; Verloop, Willemien L; Vink, Eva E; Vonken, Evert-Jan; Voskuil, Michiel; Leiner, Tim; Blankestijn, Peter J",European radiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00330-017-4770-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28271154/,134

To overcome the cost and transgene capacity limitations of traditional viral vectors, CAR T-cells were produced using the piggyBac transposon system of genetic modification. Following CAR T-cell infusion, one patient developed a gradually enlarging retroperitoneal tumor due to a CAR expressing CD4+ T-cell lymphoma. Screening of other patients led to the detection of a second CAR T-cell tumor in thoracic para-aortic lymph nodes in an asymptomatic patient. Analysis of the first lymphoma showed a high transgene copy number, but no insertion into typical oncogenes. There were also structural changes such as altered genomic copy number and point mutations unrelated to the insertion sites. Transcriptome analysis showed transgene promoter driven upregulation of transcription of surrounding regions despite insulator sequences surrounding the transgene. However, marked global changes in transcription predominantly correlated with gene copy number rather than insertion sites. In both patients, the CAR T-cell derived lymphoma progressed and one patient died. We describe the first two cases of malignant lymphoma derived from CAR gene modified T-cells.

Extended-release (ER) and long-acting (LA) opioid formulations are administered to patients with moderate to severe chronic pain requiring around-the-clock analgesia. Given the large quantity of active ingredient contained within some dosage strengths, this medication class is associated with serious risks when taken improperly. In response to growing reports of abuse and overdose deaths, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced the need for a risk mitigation strategy for the entire class of medication. The class-wide Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) for ER/LA opioids will emphasize prescriber training and patient education to ensure that the therapeutic benefits outweigh the risks of addiction, unintentional overdose, and death. As primary care, pain management, and palliative care clinicians often encounter patients who require ER/LA opioids, an understanding of the suggested requirements and potential impact of this regulation is essential.","Gudin, Jeffrey",Journal of pain & palliative care pharmacotherapy,https://doi.org/10.3109/15360288.2012.679724; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22764852/,134

Thermal conduction properties of gastric tissue during ablation have not yet been defined, but are necessary for optimizing the technique and translating ablation to clinical therapy. We developed custom needle-based transmural temperature probes to quantify the temperature of gastric tissue during ablation. These probes were applied in vivo in pigs (n=5), during gastric ablation (70 °C, 10 s duration), at distances of 2.5 - 20 mm from the ablation catheter tip. Thermal response of the tissue was non-linear; the maximum temperature increase from baseline (33.3 ± 1.0 °C) was observed at the closest temperature probe to the catheter tip (2.5 mm, 14.9 °C), and temperature change decreased with distance from the catheter tip. Probes positioned between 5 -20 mm from the catheter tip recorded temperature increases of less than 5.6 °C. This study provides methods for monitoring temperature during in vivo ablation, and demonstrates that functional temperature increases from ablation were restricted to within approximately 5 mm of the catheter. These methods can now be applied to optimize effective ablation parameters, and to inform models of gastric ablation.","Sayat, Mikhael; Aghababaie, Zahra; Cheng, Leo K; Paskaranandavadivel, Niranchan; Avci, Recep; Rickus, Johan; Ruha, Wharengaro; Angeli, Timothy R",Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

RANKL has known immunomodulatory effect. The largest study to date that reviewed denosumab efficacy in osteoporosis demonstrated an increased incidence of serious adverse events of infection (SAEI). We aimed to further evaluate risk of infection and SAEI in denosumab-treated patients. METHOD PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Web of Science were searched for randomized controlled trials. Studies comparing denosumab 60 mg every 6 months with placebo or bisphosphonate for treatment of low bone mineral density were included. Trials were excluded for use of denosumab in cancer patients treated for skeletal-related events, immunosuppressed patient populations, or for comparison to teriparatide. Risk ratios (RR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) were pooled using a fixed effects model, or a random effects model if heterogeneity occurred. RESULTS Twenty-four randomized controlled trials (20 470 patients) were analyzed. An increased incidence of any infection (RR 1.11; 95% CI 1.02-1.20; P = 0.02) was observed in denosumab-treated patients compared with bisphosphonates, but not when compared with placebo. In contrast, a higher incidence of SAEI (RR 1.21; 95% CI 1.03-1.43; P = 0.02) was seen with denosumab when compared with placebo, but not compared with bisphosphonates. CONCLUSION Denosumab-treated patients with low bone mineral density have slightly increased incidence of SAEI compared with placebo, but not when compared with bisphosphonates. Application of these results requires consideration of the entire body of data available regarding denosumab safety.","Catton, Brett; Surangiwala, Salman; Towheed, Tanveer",International journal of rheumatic diseases,https://doi.org/10.1111/1756-185x.14101; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33793076/,134

Several studies have been proposed and started since then, mainly covering prevention, diagnosis, management, and treatment. Objective To identify and categorize all intervention studies up to the end of May related to SARS-CoV-2 infection, according to population and geo-graphical location (emphasis in Latin America) and to verify if there is any correlation according to purpose, phase, and recruitment status. Methods One thousand six hundred seventy-two trials were selected from 1705 until May 24 on the World Health Organization clinical trials platform related to COVID-19. Jupyter and Python tools were used for data processing and cleaning. Results One thousand six hundred seventy-two intervention studies related to SARS-CoV-2 infection were found. China, The United States, Iran, France, and Spain are the countries participating in the largest number of studies, while only 4,1% are from Latin America (mostly Brazilian). 28 studies are focusing only on older adults, and ten studies are based exclusively on populations under 19 years of age. Conclusion The worldwide interest in this new disease is reflected in the increasing number of intervention studies that are being carried out to date. How-ever, the studies analyzed do not cover the most vulnerable age groups proportionally and do not have equitable participation of all the coun-tries. In Latin America, this problem is exacerbated by the region's social, economic, and political limitations. Because it is an emerging disease, there is still not enough information to establish strong correlations between the analyzed variables, and the standardization of protocols is not yet definite because most of the studies are in progress.","Solano-Sandí, Luis Armando; Cambronero-Valverde, Mónica; Herrera-Watson, Guadalupe",Medwave,https://doi.org/10.5867/medwave.2020.09.8051; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33141813/,134

Individuals with identified pathogenic variants in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene can benefit from cancer risk-reducing strategies. In the recent years, there has been an increase in the demand of genetic services. In light of the ongoing COVID19 pandemic, alternatives to face-to-face consultations have had to be considered and adopted, including telemedicine. Informed consent is necessary for genetic testing. Studies have suggested that increased levels of cancer-specific distress may impair the patient's ability to retain information, therefore, providing informed consent. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to answer if telephone genetic counseling for BRCA1 and BRCA2 genetic testing is non-inferior to in-person genetic counseling for the outcomes of cancer-specific distress and genetic knowledge. Databases of Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, SciELO, Web of Science, CENTRAL, ProQuest Dissertation & Theses Database, Clinicaltrials.gov, EU clinical trials register were accessed to identify any published or unpublished relevant literature. Random-effects models were used for the meta-analysis. Four studies were included in the qualitative synthesis of the results. Three studies were included in the quantitative synthesis of the results. Telephone genetic counseling was non-inferior compared to in-person genetic counseling for the outcomes of cancer-specific distress and genetic knowledge. Sensitivity analysis corroborated the main results. Telephone genetic counseling for BRCA1/BRCA2 genetic testing may be an alternative model of delivering genetic services in front of the increased demand/or when required by social context. However, the paucity of the evidence prevents from drawing strong conclusions regarding the generalizability of these results. Further research is needed to strengthen the conclusions.","Bracke, Xavier; Roberts, Jonathan; McVeigh, Terri P",Journal of genetic counseling,https://doi.org/10.1002/jgc4.1343; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33131182/,134

We conducted a scoping review of English language articles describing the range of online alternative approaches. Furthermore, we systematically identified studies directly comparing online alternatives with face-to-face approaches. Synthesis of these 11 articles (565 participants) suggests that online alternatives should not be viewed as a straightforward replacement for face-to-face, a particularly important finding given the rapid communication changes occurring in the COVID-19 pandemic.

We are already facing a ""second wave"" of infections and we might be dealing during the next months with a ""third wave"" and subsequently new waves. Therefore, during the different waves of the COVID-19 pandemic we have to face the problems of how to perform elective cardiac invasive procedures in non-COVID patients and which patients/procedures should be prioritised. In this context, the interplay between the pandemic stage, the availability of healthcare resources and the priority of specific cardiac disorders is crucial. Clear pathways for ""hot"" or presumed ""hot"" patients and ""cold"" patients are mandatory in each hospital. Depending on the local testing capacity and intensity of transmission in the area, healthcare facilities may test patients for SARS-CoV-2 infection before the interventional procedure, regardless of risk assessment for COVID-19. Pre-hospital testing should always be conducted in the presence of symptoms suggestive of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In cases of confirmed or suspected COVID-19 positive patients, full personal protective equipment using FFP 2/N95 masks, eye protection, gowning and gloves is indicated during cardiac interventions for healthcare workers. When patients have tested negative for COVID-19, medical masks may be sufficient.

Now, we developed a novel technique of performing Cox-maze IV ablation entirely by bipolar clamp through RM. To compare the outcomes of RM or MS for patients undergoing mitral valve surgery and concomitant Cox-maze IV ablation with entirely bipolar clamp. All 152 patients underwent mitral valve surgery and concomitant Cox-maze IV ablation with bipolar clamp through RM (n = 69) or MS (n = 83) were analyzed for outcome differences. The etiology of mitral valve disease was rheumatic (n = 97) and degenerative (n = 55). All patients had long-standing persistent atrial fibrillation (AF). Diameter of left atrium ranged from 42 to 60 mm. All patients successfully underwent Cox-maze IV ablation by bipolar clamp. RM group had longer cardiopulmonary bypass time (130.3 ± 17.7 vs 115.3 ± 14.4 min; P < 0.001) and aortic cross-clamp time (91.8 ± 12.7 vs 74.6 ± 9.3 min; P < 0.001). But mechanical ventilation time (14.2 ± 6.6 vs 21.3 ± 9.0 h; P < 0.001) and hospital length of stay (9.3 ± 2.6 vs 11.7 ± 3.0 days; P < 0.001) were shorter in RM group. At discharge, the maintenance of normal sinus rhythm (NSR) was 94.2% in RM group and 95.1% in MS group (P = 1.000). Cumulative maintenance of NSR at 2 years postoperatively was 85.1 ± 5.8% in RM group and 88.6 ± 3.6% in MS group (P = 0.767). RM can achieve similar therapeutic effect to MS for patients undergoing mitral valve surgery and concomitant Cox-maze IV ablation with entirely bipolar clamp.

99552,Robotic versus laparoscopic resection for sigmoid diverticulitis with fistula.,2015,"RATIONALE Brief recurrent apneas in preterm infants and adults can precipitate rapid and severe arterial O(2) desaturation for reasons that remain unclear. OBJECTIVES We tested a mathematically derived hypothesis that when breathing terminates apnea, mixed-venous hypoxemia continues into the subsequent apnea; as a result, there is a surge in pulmonary O(2) uptake that rapidly depletes the finite alveolar O(2) store, thereby accelerating arterial O(2) desaturation. METHODS Recurrent apneas were simulated in an experimental lamb model. Pulmonary O(2) uptake was calculated from continuously measured arterial and mixed-venous O(2) saturation and cardiac output. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Direct measurements revealed that asynchrony in the desaturation and resaturation of arterial and venous blood gave rise to dips and surges in O(2) uptake. After desaturation to 50%, a typical nadir in preterm infants, O(2) uptake surged to a peak of 176.9 ± 7.8% of metabolic rate. During subsequent apneas, desaturation rate was increased two- to threefold greater than during isolated apneas, in direct proportion to the magnitude of the surge in O(2) uptake (P < 0.001; R(2) = 0.897). Application of our mathematical model to a published recording of cyclic apneas in a preterm infant precisely reproduced the accelerated desaturation rates of up to 15% · s(-1) observed clinically. CONCLUSIONS Rapid depletion of alveolar O(2) stores by surges in O(2) uptake almost completely explains the acceleration of desaturation that occurs during recurrent apnea. This powerful mechanism is likely to explain the severity of intermittent hypoxemia that is associated with neurocognitive and cardiovascular morbidities in preterm infants and adults.","Sands, Scott A; Edwards, Bradley A; Kelly, Vanessa J; Skuza, Elizabeth M; Davidson, Malcolm R; Wilkinson, Malcolm H; Berger, Philip J",American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1164/rccm.201003-0477oc; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20522790/,134

METHODS Fourteen healthy adult male subjects were enrolled in a two-phase randomized crossover-design study. In each phase the volunteers received placebo or compound glycyrrhizin tablets (75 mg glycyrrhizin three times daily) for 6 days. On the seventh day, a single oral dose of 100 mg talinolol was administered, and blood samples were obtained to determine plasma talinolol concentrations, measured in plasma by high-performance liquid chromatography with an ultraviolet detector. Non-compartmental analysis was used to characterize talinolol plasma concentration-time profiles. All pharmacokinetics parameters were calculated using DAS ver. 2.1 software, and statistical analyses were performed with SPSS ver. 13.0 software. Analysis of variance was used to check the difference of the means of the pharmacokinetic parameters between the two treatments at a significance level of 0.05. RESULTS All treatments were well tolerated during the study period. The geometric mean ± standard deviation of the AUC(0-∞) for talinolol treated by glycyrrhizin and talinolol treated by placebo was 2,218.3 ± 724.3 and 1,988.2 ± 649.2 ng·h/mL, respectively. The 90 % confidence intervals for the ratio of adjusted geometric means (glycyrrhizin:placebo) for AUC(0-∞) and C (max) fell wholly within the interval [80, 125]. Six days of glycyrrhizin treatment resulted in no significant alterations in the pharmacokinetic parameters (AUC(0-∞), AUC(0-24), C (max), t (max), t (½)) for talinolol. CONCLUSIONS Continuous glycyrrhizin administration had no induction effect on the expression of P-gp in our trial.

DESIGN Antimicrobial time-kill assay. SETTING Laboratory-based study. METHODS An adapted time-kill assay was conducted to characterize the antimicrobial efficacy of the developed coatings. A simulated touch-contact pathogenic exposure to Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923), Gram-negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853), and the yeast Candida albicans (ATCC 10231), as well as corresponding resistant strains of gentamicin-methicillin-resistant S. aureus (ATCC 33592), azlocillin-carbenicillin-resistant P. aeruginosa (DSM 46316), and a fluconazole-resistant C. albicans strain was undertaken. Linear regression modeling was used to deduce microbial reduction rates. RESULTS A >7 log reduction in microbial colony forming units was achieved within minutes on surfaces with cold spray coatings compared to a single log bacterial reduction on copper metal sheets within a 3 hour contact period. Copper-coated 3-dimensional (3D) printed acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) achieved complete microbial elimination against all tested pathogens within a 15 minute exposure period. Similarly, a copper-on-copper coating achieved microbial elimination within 10 minutes and within 5 minutes with the addition of silver powder as a 5 wt% coating constituent.

METHODS We conducted a cross-sectional survey. Respondents were asked about their current clinical practice related to sciatica. Three authors rated the respondents' adherence to the guidelines on a three-point Likert scale. RESULTS Eighty neurologists and 44 anesthesiologists completed the questionnaire. Neurologists diagnose their sciatica patients primarily using a magnetic resonance imaging (89%). Selective diagnostic nerve blocks are considered useful by 81% of the neurologists. Neurologists primarily treat patients with pain medication, and 40% of them think epidural steroid injections are effective in 40-60% of injected patients. Twenty-nine percent of neurologists refer patients to a neurosurgeon after 4 months. Anesthesiologists consider a selective diagnostic nerve root block to have a higher diagnostic value than mapping. The most reported side effect of epidural injections is exacerbation of pain (82%). Pulse radiofrequency is applied in 9-11% of acute cases. The results also indicate that Dutch neurologists and anesthesiologists follow an evidence-based approach that is strictly or broadly in line with the guideline. CONCLUSIONS Neurologists treat sciatica patients initially with pain medication and physiotherapy, followed by epidural steroid injections and referral for surgery. Anesthesiologists treat sciatica patients with one or more steroid injections or may perform a selective nerve root block. Imaging, selective nerve root blocks, medication, physiotherapy, and pulse radiofrequency are topics of further research.","Ter Meulen, Bastiaan; Overweg, Caroliene; Feenstra, Thomas; Brouwer, Brigitte; Terheggen, Michel; van Dongen, Hanneke; Kallewaard, Jan Willem; Ostelo, Raymond; Weinstein, Henry",European neurology,https://doi.org/10.1159/000515578; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33902042/,134

101072,Outcomes in revisional bariatric surgery: a high-volume single institution experience.,2020-08-04,"OBJECTIVES Music may be a valuable and low-cost coping strategy for cancer patients. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to identify the psychological and physical effects of music interventions in cancer treatment. METHODS We included randomized, controlled trials with adult patients in active cancer treatment exposed to different music interventions versus control conditions. Qualitative studies and systematic reviews were excluded. We identified a total of 2624 records through 2 systematic searches (June 2015 and September 2016) in PubMed, Scopus, EMBASE, Cinahl, Web of Science, Cochrane, and PsycINFO and used Risk of Bias Assessment, GRADE and Checklist for Reporting Music-Based Interventions to evaluate the music applied and quality of the studies. We conducted meta-analyses using Review Manager (version 5.3). PROSPERO reg. no. CRD42015026024. RESULTS We included 25 RCT's (N = 1784) of which 20 were eligible for the meta-analysis (N = 1565). Music reduced anxiety (SMD -0·80 [95% CI, -1.35 to -0.25]), pain (SMD -0.88 [95% CI -1.45 to -0.32]), and improved mood (SMD -0.55 [95% CI, -0.98 to -0.13]). However, studies were hampered by heterogeneity with I2 varying between 54% and 96%. Quality of the studies ranged from very low to low. The most effective mode of music intervention appeared to be passive listening to self-selected, recorded music in a single session design. CONCLUSIONS Music may be a tool in reducing anxiety, pain, and improving mood among patients with cancer in active treatment. However, methodological limitations in the studies conducted so far prevent firm conclusions.","Bro, Margrethe Langer; Jespersen, Kira Vibe; Hansen, Julie Bolvig; Vuust, Peter; Abildgaard, Niels; Gram, Jeppe; Johansen, Christoffer",Psycho-oncology,https://doi.org/10.1002/pon.4470; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28626867/,134

In the present study, we report that chrysin nanoparticles (chrysin NPs) protect Wistar rats against kindling-induced epilepsy. Nanoparticles of sizes less than 150 nm with a spherical shape were prepared using poly(d,l-lactic-co-glycolic acid) and polyvinyl alcohol, respectively, as polymer and stabilizer. Rats were injected with subconvulsive doses of pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) (35 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) every second day, with 22 injections in total, and on the same days, they received protective doses of the chrysin NPs (5 and 10 µg/mL, PO), respectively, 45 min before each PTZ injection. After the last PTZ injection, an average of thirteen seizure scores was recorded. Animals were killed by decapitation 24 h after a seizure. The cortex and hippocampus were removed and stored in liquid nitrogen for determining oxidative stress terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling assay, histopathology, and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction for messenger RNA expression. The result showed chrysin NPs treatment has counteracted oxidative stress, reduced neuronal apoptosis, and upregulated nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), and NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that the neuroprotective effect of chrysin NPs against kindling-induced epilepsy might be escorted by the alleviation of oxidative stress through the Nrf2/antioxidant response element/HO-1 pathway signal pathway.","Zhang, Ying; Zhao, Jing; Afzal, Obaid; Kazmi, Imran; Al-Abbasi, Fahad A; Altamimi, Abdulmalik S A; Yang, Zhen",Journal of biochemical and molecular toxicology,https://doi.org/10.1002/jbt.22634; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32991785/,134

The great majority of fatal events have been recorded in adults older than 70 years; of them, a large proportion had comorbidities. Since data regarding the epidemiologic and clinical characteristics in neonates and children developing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are scarce and originate mainly from one country (China), we reviewed all the current literature from 1 December 2019 to 7 May 2020 to provide useful information about SARS-CoV2 viral biology, epidemiology, diagnosis, clinical features, treatment, prevention, and hospital organization for clinicians dealing with this selected population. IMPACT: Children usually develop a mild form of COVID-19, rarely requiring high-intensity medical treatment in pediatric intensive care unit. Vertical transmission is unlikely, but not completely excluded. Children with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 must be isolated and healthcare workers should wear appropriate protective equipment. Some clinical features (higher incidence of fever, vomiting and diarrhea, and a longer incubation period) are more common in children than in adults, as well as some radiologic aspects (more patchy shadow opacities on CT scan images than ground-glass opacities). Supportive and symptomatic treatments (oxygen therapy and antibiotics for preventing/treating bacterial coinfections) are recommended in these patients.","Di Nardo, Matteo; van Leeuwen, Grace; Loreti, Alessandra; Barbieri, Maria Antonietta; Guner, Yit; Locatelli, Franco; Ranieri, Vito Marco",Pediatric research,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-020-1065-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32679582/,134

101439,Predictors of immediate continence following robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.,2013,"INTRODUCTION Mononeuritis multiplex (MM) is an unusual form of peripheral neuropathy involving at least two noncontiguous peripheral nerve trunks. The pure sensory form of MM occurs rarely. Immunoglobulin (Ig)G subclass deficiency is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorder. Up to 50% of adults with selective subnormal IgG1 levels or selective IgG1 deficiency have a concomitant autoimmune disorder. Herein, we report the case of a patient with MM and selective IgG1 deficiency who showed remarkable clinical improvement after 2-year combination therapy with the DPP-4 inhibitor sitagliptin plus vitamin D3. CASE REPORT A 49-year-old man developed numbness in right hand and forearm. After 6 months, the patient developed left forefoot numbness. Approximately 8 years later, the patient started to develop numbness also in the right forefoot, along with symptoms of evening fatigue and occasional orthostatic hypotension. The patient also reported recurrent candidiasis in glans and intergluteal areas since adolescence. Electromyoneurography of lower and upper limbs revealed the presence of multiple mononeuropathies. Protein electrophoresis showed hypogammaglobulinemia and low serum IgG1 levels. Sural nerve biopsy showed the presence of perineuritis. The patient was diagnosed with MM due to perineuritis probably secondary to IgG1 deficiency. We, then, proposed combination therapy with sitagliptin and vitamin D3 in the attempt to achieve immunomodulation. At the last follow-up visit (2 years), the patient showed persistent clinical improvement, increase in IgG1 levels and normalization of protein electrophoresis. CONCLUSIONS To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case showing a remarkable clinical improvement of MM and selective IgG1 deficiency achieved through a combination therapy with sitagliptin and vitamin D3.","Maia Pinheiro, M; Moura Maia Pinheiro, F; Pires Amaral Resende, L L; Nogueira Diniz, S; Fabbri, A; Infante, M",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202008_22502; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32767343/,134
101686,Barbed vs conventional sutures in bariatric surgery: a propensity score analysis from a high-volume center.,2019,"The expectations from any future disease-modifying treatment for knee osteoarthritis (KOA) are extremely high as it has to impact the joint as a whole leading to favorable alterations of diverse tissues and functions. In this light, targeting the knee only from the inside may not be biologically justified for the management of a whole joint disease such as KOA. Our hypothesis to test is whether any injectable therapeutic intervention alone can lead to disease modification of KOA which is viewed in the complexity of the modern concept of osteoarthritis (OA) as a whole joint disease. Therefore, we aimed at analyzing the intraarticular route to the KOA patient in an attempt to unveil its ""biological"" constraints. A comprehensive search through databases was carried out using specific keywords to add objectivity to the main messages. The literature analysis has shown that ""cutting-edge"" intraarticular therapies may offer a key to non-invasive symptomatic relief. Changing the course of KOA, however, may necessitate a multimodal approach towards the knee joint including a combination of intraarticular injections with interventions on multiple levels. Importantly, our understanding of OA has evolved redefining the concept of the disease, being in interaction with the human body as a whole. Any future conservative disease-modifying treatment of KOA should aim at a multimodal, holistic approach towards the knee joint including but not limited only to intraarticular injections. A combination with other interventions should be further researched.","Georgiev, Tsvetoslav",Rheumatology international,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00296-020-04681-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32803403/,134

This study presents an age-specific susceptible-exposed-infected-recovery-death model that considers the unique characteristics of COVID-19 to examine the effectiveness of various non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) in New York City (NYC). Numerical experiments from our model show that the control policies implemented in NYC reduced the number of infections by 72% [interquartile range (IQR) 53-95] and the number of deceased cases by 76% (IQR 58-96) by the end of 2020. Among all the NPIs, social distancing for the entire population and protection for the elderly in public facilities is the most effective control measure in reducing severe infections and deceased cases. School closure policy may not work as effectively as one might expect in terms of reducing the number of deceased cases. Our simulation results provide novel insights into the city-specific implementation of NPIs with minimal social disruption considering the locations and population characteristics.","Yang, Jiannan; Zhang, Qingpeng; Cao, Zhidong; Gao, Jianxi; Pfeiffer, Dirk; Zhong, Lu; Zeng, Daniel Dajun",Chaos,https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0040560; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33653072/,134

103163,Real-time navigation by fluorescence-based enhanced reality for precise estimation of future anastomotic site in digestive surgery.,2014,"BACKGROUND The presence of the A118G single nucleotide polymorphism in the OPRM1 gene as well as noxious stimulation might affect the requirements of remifentanil for patients undergoing ultrasonographic endoscopy under sedation-analgesia with propofol and remifentanil. Bispectral index (BIS) was used as a surrogate measure of effect. METHOD A total of 207 patients were screened for A118G and randomly received different combinations of propofol and remifentanil, changed depending on the nausea response to endoscopy tube introduction. Nonlinear mixed effects modelling was used to establish the relation between propofol and remifentanil with respect to BIS and to investigate the influence of A118G or noxious stimulation. The value of k e0 for propofol and remifentanil was estimated to avoid the hysteresis between predicted effect site concentration (Ce) and BIS. RESULTS Data from 176 patients were analysed. Eleven were recessive homozygous for A118G (OPRM = 1). A total of 165 patients were either dominant homozygous or heterozygous and considered normal (OPRM = 0). The estimated values of k e0 for propofol and remifentanil were 0.122 and 0.148 min(-1). Propofol and remifentanil were synergistic with respect to the BIS (α = 1.85). EC50 estimate for propofol was 3.86 µg/ml and for remifentanil 19.6 ng/ml in normal patients and 326 ng/ml in OPRM = 1 patients. BIS increases around 4% for the same effect site concentrations with noxious stimulation. CONCLUSIONS Predicted effect site concentration of remifentanil ranging 1-5 ng/ml synergistically potentiates the effects of propofol on the BIS but has no effect in A118G patients. Noxious stimulation increases BIS values by 4% at the same concentrations of propofol and remifentanil.","Borrat, Xavier; Trocóniz, Iñaki F; Valencia, José F; Rivadulla, Silvia; Sendino, Oriol; Llach, Josep; Muñoz, Jenifer; Castellví-Bel, Sergi; Jospin, Mathieu; Jensen, Erik W; Castells, Antoni; Gambús, Pedro L",Anesthesiology,https://doi.org/10.1097/aln.0b013e31828e1544; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23503369/,134

This study compares the haemodynamic efficacy of a novel neuromuscular electrical stimulation device with intermittent pneumatic compression in healthy subjects. METHODS Ten healthy volunteers (mean age 27.1 ± 3.8 years, body mass index 24.8 ± 3.6 kg/m(2)) were randomised into two groups, in an interventional crossover trial. Devices used were the SCD Express™ Compression System, (Covidien, Ireland) and the geko™, (Firstkind Ltd, UK). Devices were applied bilaterally, and haemodynamic measurements taken from the left leg. Changes to haemodynamic parameters (superficial femory artery and femoral vein) and laser Doppler measurements from the hand and foot were compared. RESULTS Intermittent pneumatic compression caused 51% (p = 0.002), 5% (ns) and 3% (ns) median increases in venous peak velocity, time-averaged maximum velocity and volume flow, respectively; neuromuscular electrical stimulator stimulation caused a 103%, 101% and 101% median increases in the same parameters (all p = 0.002). The benefit was lost upon deactivation. Intermittent pneumatic compression did not improve arterial haemodynamics. Neuromuscular electrical stimulator caused 11%, 84% and 75% increase in arterial parameters (p < 0.01). Laser Doppler readings taken from the leg were increased by neuromuscular electrical stimulator (p < 0.001), dropping after deactivation. For intermittent pneumatic compression, the readings decreased during use but increased after cessation. Hand flux signal dropped during activation of both devices, rising after cessation. DISCUSSION The neuromuscular electrical stimulator device used in this study enhances venous flow and peak velocity in the legs of healthy subjects and is equal or superior to intermittent pneumatic compression. This warrants further clinical and economic evaluation for deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis and exploration of the haemodynamic effect in venous pathology. It also enhances arterial time-averaged maximum velocity and flow rate, which may prove to be of clinical use in the management of peripheral arterial disease. The effect on the microcirculation as evidenced by laser Doppler fluximetry may reflect a clinically beneficial target in microvascular disease, such as in the diabetic foot.","Williams, K J; Moore, H M; Davies, A H",Phlebology,https://doi.org/10.1177/0268355514531255; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24722790/,134

We aimed to assess the effectiveness of IPC in primary care settings. Methods An overview (review of systematic reviews) was carried out. We searched nine databases and employed a double selection and data extraction method. Patient-related outcomes were categorized, and results coded as improvement (+), worsening (-), mixed results (?) or no change (0). Results 34 reviews were included. Six types of IPC were identified: IPC in primary care (large scope) (n = 8), physician-nurse in primary care (n = 1), primary care physician (PCP)-specialty care provider (n = 5), PCP-pharmacist (n = 3), PCP-mental healthcare provider (n = 15), and intersectoral collaboration (n = 2). In general, IPC in primary care was beneficial for patients with variation between types of IPC. Whereas reviews about IPC in primary care (large scope) showed better processes of care and higher patient satisfaction, other types of IPC reported mixed results for clinical outcomes, healthcare use and patient-reported outcomes. Also, reviews focusing on interventions based on pre-existing and well-defined models, such as collaborative care, overall reported more benefits. However, heterogeneity between the included primary studies hindered comparison and often led to the report of mixed results. Finally, professional- and organizational-related outcomes were under-reported, and cost-related outcomes showed some promising results for IPC based on pre-existing models; results were lacking for other types. Conclusions This overview suggests that interprofessional collaboration can be effective in primary care. Better understanding of the characteristics of IPC processes, their implementation, and the identification of effective elements, merits further attention.","Carron, Tania; Rawlinson, Cloe; Arditi, Chantal; Cohidon, Christine; Hong, Quan Nha; Pluye, Pierre; Gilles, Ingrid; Peytremann-Bridevaux, Isabelle",International journal of integrated care,https://doi.org/10.5334/ijic.5588; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34220395/,134

We use a staggered difference-in-difference model to explore whether state policies lead to preventive behaviors. We further examine heterogeneity in individual responses to state mandates by including interaction terms with health risk, economic insecurity, and media consumption. The study finds that state policies lead to increased adoption of these behaviors. Our findings also suggest that old age and living with the elderly are key predictors of preventive behavior adoption in the presence or even absence of state mandates. However, the economically insecure, such as the unemployed, those with low incomes and net worth, or without health insurance, are less likely to adopt preventive behaviors regardless of the mandates. The adoption of the behaviors is also polarized between CNN users and Fox News/Social Media users, with greater compliance by the former.","Shin, Su Hyun; Ji, Hyunjung; Lim, HanNa",Social science & medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2021.113944; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33940436/,134

Retrograde intubation is useful for obtaining endotracheal access when direct laryngoscopy proves difficult. The technique is a practical option in the ""cannot intubate / can ventilate"" scenario. However, it is equally useful as an elective technique in awake patients with anticipated difficult airways. Many practitioners report difficulty successfully advancing the endotracheal tube due to anatomical obstructions and the acute angle of the anterograde guide. The purpose of this study was to test whether a more caudal tracheal puncture would increase the success rate. Methods. Twenty-four anesthesiology residents were randomly assigned to either a cricothyroid or a cricotracheal puncture group. Each was instructed how to perform the technique and then attempted it on a manikin at their assigned site. Data collection included whether the trachea was intubated, the number of attempts required, and the total time. Results. Both groups displayed a high degree of success. While the group assigned to the cricotracheal site required significantly more time to perform the procedure, they accomplished it in fewer attempts than the cricothyroid group. Conclusion. Retrograde intubation performed via a cricotracheal puncture site, while more time consuming, resulted in fewer attempts to advance the endotracheal tube and may reduce in vivo laryngeal trauma.","Harris, Eric A; Arheart, Kristopher L; Fischler, Kenneth E",Anesthesiology research and practice,https://doi.org/10.1155/2013/354317; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23878535/,134
104598,Is LMWH Sufficient for Anticoagulant Prophylaxis in Bariatric Surgery? Prospective Study.,2017,"Telepsychology has the potential to help mental health service providers reach millions of people in rural areas or those limited by other factors. This study examined pre-COVID-19 deterrents reported by psychologists who did not use telepsychology. Participants were 1,400 psychologists with an average of 26.3 (SD = 11.18) years in practice who were currently practicing within the United States but did not currently use telepsychology. All 50 states were represented as well as Washington, DC. The most commonly reported deterrents, from most to least frequent, were insufficient training, client safety/crisis concerns, privacy, legality, ethics, reimbursement, efficacy, prohibitive organizational policies/culture, and insufficient demand. Logistic regression analyses suggested that psychologists' deterrents varied based in part on demographic and practice characteristics. Psychologists practicing within medical centers or Veterans Affairs facilities were less likely to indicate safety, privacy, legal issues, ethics, and efficacy as a concern. Older psychologists were less deterred by reimbursement issues and more concerned about effectiveness. Those using cognitive-behavioral approaches were less likely to report efficacy and safety concerns. Cisgender men were less likely to be deterred by safety or privacy issues, and White psychologists were less likely to indicate safety as a deterrent. Additional telepsychology training and information for psychologists may increase its use and foster improved mental health care access for populations unable to attend in-person sessions. A more focused approach to training and implementation of telepsychology that considers the needs and concerns of the target psychologist group could benefit organizations promoting its use.

105626,Functional recovery after partial nephrectomy: effects of volume loss and ischemic injury.,2012,"Variation in immune defense influences infectious disease dynamics within and among species. Understanding how variation in immunity drives pathogen transmission among species is especially important for animals that are reservoir hosts for zoonotic pathogens. Bats, in particular, have a propensity to host serious viral zoonoses without developing clinical disease themselves. The immunological adaptations that allow bats to host viruses without disease may be related to their adaptations for flight (e.g., in metabolism and mediation of oxidative stress). A number of analyses report greater richness of zoonotic pathogens in bats than in other taxa, such as birds (i.e., mostly volant vertebrates) and rodents (i.e., nonvolant small mammals), but immunological comparisons between bats and these other taxa are rare. To examine interspecific differences in bacterial killing ability (BKA), a functional measure of overall constitutive innate immunity, we use a phylogenetic meta-analysis to compare how BKA responds to the acute stress of capture and to storage time of frozen samples across the orders Aves and Chiroptera. After adjusting for host phylogeny, sample size, and total microbe colony-forming units, we find preliminary evidence that the constitutive innate immune defense of bats may be more resilient to handling stress and storage time than that of birds. This pattern was also similar when we analyzed the proportion of nonnegative and positive effect sizes per species, using phylogenetic comparative methods. We discuss potential physiological and evolutionary mechanisms by which complement proteins may differ between species orders and suggest future avenues for comparative field studies of immunity between sympatric bats, birds, and rodents in particular.","Becker, Daniel J; Czirják, Gábor Á; Rynda-Apple, Agnieszka; Plowright, Raina K",Physiological and biochemical zoology : PBZ,https://doi.org/10.1086/701069; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30481115/,134

Data Sources: A MEDLINE/PubMed and EMBASE (January 1, 1985, to June 19, 2020) literature search was performed using the terms ferric maltol, accrufer, feraccru, iron maltol, ferric trimaltol, iron deficiency, iron deficiency anemia, inflammatory bowel disease, and chronic kidney disease. Additional data sources included prescribing information, abstracts, and the National Institutes of Health Clinical Trials Registry. Study Selection/Data Extraction: English language literature evaluating FM pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, or safety in the treatment of IDA were reviewed. Data Synthesis: FM is a ferric, non-salt-based oral iron formulation demonstrating improved tolerance in patients with previous intolerance to other iron formulations. Phase 3 trials demonstrated significant improvements in anemia and serum iron parameters in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Common adverse effects were gastrointestinal intolerance. Relevance to Patient Care and Clinical Practice: FM is an effective and well-tolerated alternative to oral iron salts for patients with IBD or CKD and IDA. Emerging data suggest that FM is noninferior to intravenous (IV) ferric carboxymaltose in patients with IBD and IDA. Prior to selecting FM over IV iron products, consideration should be given to time to normalization of Hb, ease of administration, cost, and tolerability. Conclusion: FM is a relatively safe, effective oral iron therapy that may be better tolerated than other oral iron formulations. FM may be an effective alternative to IV iron in patients with IBD.","Khoury, Adonice; Pagan, Kaley A; Farland, Michelle Z",The Annals of pharmacotherapy,https://doi.org/10.1177/1060028020941014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32633548/,134

Objective To evaluate new data and incorporate them into current recommendations for initiating HIV therapy, monitoring individuals starting on therapy, changing regimens, preventing HIV infection for those at risk, and special considerations for older people with HIV. Evidence Review New evidence was collected since the previous International Antiviral (formerly AIDS) Society-USA recommendations in 2018, including data published or presented at peer-reviewed scientific conferences through August 22, 2020. A volunteer panel of 15 experts in HIV research and patient care considered these data and updated previous recommendations. Findings From 5316 citations about antiretroviral drugs identified, 549 were included to form the evidence basis for these recommendations. Antiretroviral therapy is recommended as soon as possible for all individuals with HIV who have detectable viremia. Most patients can start with a 3-drug regimen or now a 2-drug regimen, which includes an integrase strand transfer inhibitor. Effective options are available for patients who may be pregnant, those who have specific clinical conditions, such as kidney, liver, or cardiovascular disease, those who have opportunistic diseases, or those who have health care access issues. Recommended for the first time, a long-acting antiretroviral regimen injected once every 4 weeks for treatment or every 8 weeks pending approval by regulatory bodies and availability. For individuals at risk for HIV, preexposure prophylaxis with an oral regimen is recommended or, pending approval by regulatory bodies and availability, with a long-acting injection given every 8 weeks. Monitoring before and during therapy for effectiveness and safety is recommended. Switching therapy for virological failure is relatively rare at this time, and the recommendations for switching therapies for convenience and for other reasons are included. With the survival benefits provided by therapy, recommendations are made for older individuals with HIV.

We sought to investigate the relationship between cannabis use during MOUD and a number of patient outcomes. We searched seven databases for original peer-reviewed studies documenting the relationship between cannabis use and at least one primary outcome (opioid use, treatment adherence, or treatment retention) among patients enrolled in methadone-, buprenorphine-, or naltrexone-based therapy for OUD. In total, 41 articles (including 23 methadone, 7 buprenorphine, 6 naltrexone, and 5 mixed modalities) were included in this review. For each primary outcome area, there was a small number of studies that produced findings suggestive of a supportive or detrimental role of concurrent cannabis use, but the majority of studies reported that cannabis use was not statistically significantly associated with the outcome. No studies of naltrexone treatment demonstrated significantly worse outcomes for cannabis users. We identified methodological shortcomings and future research priorities, including exploring the potential role of adjunct cannabis use for improving opioid craving and withdrawal during MOUD. While monitoring for cannabis use may help guide clinicians towards an improved treatment plan, cannabis use is unlikely to independently threaten treatment outcomes.","Lake, Stephanie; St Pierre, Michelle",Clinical psychology review,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpr.2020.101939; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33130527/,134
108468,"Structured dietary intervention to facilitate weight loss after bariatric surgery: A randomized, controlled pilot study.",2016,"BACKGROUND Healthcare providers working in hospitals are frequently exposed to patients with palliative care needs. For most patients, these reflect non-specialist rather than specialist palliative care needs. Embedding palliative care principles early in patients' disease trajectories within acute care delivery in hospitals, however, is a challenge. How to best understand the experiences of those providing non-specialist palliative care in hospitals has not been systematically assessed. AIM To synthesise the evidence on healthcare providers' views and experiences of non-specialist palliative care in hospitals. DESIGN A qualitative systematic review and thematic synthesis using Thomas and Harden's thematic synthesis framework. DATA SOURCES Databases of MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO and EMBASE were searched from date of inception to March 2018. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they reported on healthcare providers' views and experiences of non-specialist palliative care in hospitals. Studies were appraised for quality but not excluded on that basis. The review was prospectively registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews. RESULTS Thirty-nine papers of 37 studies were included, representing 985 hospital healthcare providers' views and experiences. Four major analytical themes emerged; 'Understanding of Palliative Care', 'Complexities of Communication', 'Hospital Ecosystem' and 'Doctors and Nurses - a Different Lens'. CONCLUSIONS Non-specialist palliative care in hospitals is operationalised as care in the last weeks and days of life. The organisation of acute care, inter-disciplinary working practices, clinician attitudes, poor communication structures and lack of education and training in palliative care principles exacerbates poor implementation of this care earlier for patients in hospitals.","Nevin, Mary; Hynes, Geralyn; Smith, Valerie",Palliative medicine,https://doi.org/10.1177/0269216319899335; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32020829/,134

Vaccination status, diet, and clinical outcome were also obtained when available. CPV-2b was identified in 17 dogs (37.8%), being the most frequent cause of bloody diarrhea, including completely vaccinated adult dogs. Toxigenic C. difficile and C. perfringens netF+ were detected in six (13.3%) and five (11.1%) dogs, in some cases in a co-occurrence with other enteric organisms. Three fatal cases of salmonellosis were identified in dogs fed a raw meat-based diet, raising the risks associated with this increasing practice.","Ramos, Carolina Pantuzza; Diniz, Amanda Nádia; Ribeiro, Marcio Garcia; de Paula, Carolina Lechinski; Costa, Érica Azevedo; Sonne, Luciana; Pereira, Silvia Trindade; Lopes, Carlos Eduardo Bastos; Rennó, Mário Cesar; Silva, Rodrigo Otávio Silveira",Topics in companion animal medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tcam.2021.100549; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34044173/,134

This multicenter, propensity score-matched study was performed to assess the safety and efficacy of laparoscopic caudate lobectomy (LCL). METHODS A multicenter retrospective study was performed including all patients who underwent LCL and open caudate lobectomy (OCL) in four institutions from January 2013 to December 2018. In total, 131 patients were included in this study and divided into LCL (n = 19) and OCL (n = 112) groups. LCLs were matched to OCLs (1:2) using a propensity score matching (PSM) based on nine preoperative variables, including patient demographics and tumor characteristics. The pathological results, perioperative and postoperative parameters, and short-term outcomes were compared between the two groups. RESULTS After PSM, there were 18 and 36 patients in the LCL and OCL groups, respectively. Baseline characteristics were comparable after matching. LCL was associated with less blood (100 vs. 300 ml, respectively; P < 0.001) and a shorter postoperative stay (6.0 vs 8.0 days, respectively; P = 0.003). Most patients' resection margins were > 10 mm in the LCL group (P = 0.021), and all patients with malignancy in both groups achieved R0 resection. In terms of early postoperative outcomes, the overall morbidity rate was identical in each group (11.1% vs. 11.1%, respectively; P = 1.000). No mortality occurred in either group.

The estrogen receptor (ER)-positive subtype, which accounts for 70% of breast cancer, is known to respond less to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) due to its low potential for proliferation. We hypothesized that Th2 high tumors are highly proliferative, and thus more likely to respond to NAC in ER-positive breast cancer. Methods We obtained clinicopathological data and overall survival information on 1,069 breast cancer patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Computational algorithms and CIBERSORT were used to estimate immune cell infiltration. Additionally, xCell was used for validation. Results Th2 high tumors did not consistently associate with an unfavorable immune cell composition and tumor immune microenvironment but were found to be significantly elevated in the cancer stage. Th2 high tumors also correlated with high Nottingham pathological grade, as well as with Ki-67 and proliferation score in ER-positive subtypes. High Th2 tumors achieved a pathological complete response (pCR) significantly higher in ER-positive breast cancer. Conclusions In conclusion, high levels of Th2 are associated with aggressive features of breast cancer. Th2 levels may be a biomarker in patient selection for NAC in ER-positive breast cancer.","Le, Lan; Tokumaru, Yoshihisa; Oshi, Masanori; Asaoka, Mariko; Yan, Li; Endo, Itaru; Ishikawa, Takashi; Futamura, Manabu; Yoshida, Kazuhiro; Takabe, Kazuaki",Gland surgery,https://doi.org/10.21037/gs-20-571; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33633972/,134

Beyond the demonstration of their ability to display metabolic functions in vitro, candidate cells should demonstrate achievable in situ differentiation and ability to participate to liver repopulation. In this work, we studied the in vivo behavior of adult liver mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells (ADHLSCs) after transplantation into immunodeficient mice. The kinetics of engraftment and in situ hepatogenic differentiation were analyzed. Response of transplanted ADHLSCs to regenerative stimulus was also evaluated. Nondifferentiated ADHLSCs were intrasplenically transplanted into SCID mice. Efficiency of transplantation was evaluated at the level of engraftment and in situ differentiation using immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, and RT-PCR. After bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) implantation, proliferation of transplanted ADHLSCs in response to 20% hepatectomy was assessed using immunohistochemistry. We demonstrated that ADHLSC engraftment in the SCID mouse liver was low but remained stable up to 60 days posttransplantation, when albumin (ALB) immunopositive ADHLSCs were still detected and organized as clusters. Coexpression of ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) demonstrated ADHLSC in situ differentiation mostly near the hepatic portal vein. After 20% hepatectomy on 1 month transplanted mice, the percentage of BrdU and human ALB immunopositive ADHLSCs increased from 3 to 28 days post-BrdU implantation to reach 31.3 ± 5.4% of the total analyzed human cells. In the current study, we demonstrate that transplanted ADHLSCs are able to differentiate in the non preconditioned SCID mouse liver mainly in the periportal area. In response to partial hepatectomy, integrated ADHLSCs proliferate and participate to recipient mouse liver regeneration.","Khuu, Dung Ngoc; Nyabi, Omar; Maerckx, Cédric; Sokal, Etienne; Najimi, Mustapha",Cell transplantation,https://doi.org/10.3727/096368912x659853; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23211283/,134

We hereby present our experience of laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy focused on technical notes. Technical description: A 5 trocars technique is used. Vision is provided by a 30 degree scope with 4K technology for the demolitive phase and 3D for the reconstructive phase. The right colic flexure is mobilized and an extensive Kocher maneuver is carried out exposing the inferior vena cava and left renal vein. The gastric antrum is resected with a mechanical stapler. The common hepatic artery is identified behind the superior pancreatic margin; lymphadenectomy of stations 7, 8, 9, 12 a and b is performed, until the gastroduodenal artery is cleared from the lymphatic tissue; a bull-dog clamp is placed to interrupt the arterial flow through the gastroduodenal artery, in order to exclude aberrant vascularization of the liver from the SMA. The common hepatic duct is transected just above the cystic duct. The pancreas is sectioned with monopolar energy, dividing the main pancreatic duct 2-3 mm distal to the parenchymal transection line with cold scissors, as to leave a stump that will facilitate the duct-to-mucosa anastomosis then the first jejunal loop is sectioned. A complete dissection of the mesopancreas is performed, moving from a caudal to cephalad fashion. Prior to perform the pancreatico-jejunal anastomosis, a fistula risk score based on pancreatic parenchymal texture, tumor type, Wirsung diameter, intraoperative blood loss is assessed. The pancreatico-jejunal anastomosis is carried out using prolene and pds sutures. The end-to-side hepaticojejunostomy is performed about 10 cm distant from the pancreaticojejunostomy. The side to- side gastrojejunostomy is performed using a 60 mm linear stapler. Conclusion: Laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy is a demanding procedure affected by high morbidity rates. The standardization of the technique could lead the way to reduce such rates and favor its adoption.","Mazzola, Michele; Morini, Lorenzo; Crippa, Jacopo; Maspero, Marianna; Zironda, Andrea; Giani, Alessandro; Martini, Paolo De; Ferrari, Giovanni",Chirurgia,https://doi.org/10.21614/chirurgia.115.3.385; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32614295/,134
111819,Utilization of a three-dimensional printed kidney model for favorable TRIFECTA achievement in early experience of robot-assisted partial nephrectomy.,2020-12-01,"BACKGROUND Many dental procedures produce aerosols (droplets, droplet nuclei and splatter) that harbour various pathogenic micro-organisms and may pose a risk for the spread of infections between dentist and patient. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to greater concern about this risk. OBJECTIVES To assess the effectiveness of methods used during dental treatment procedures to minimize aerosol production and reduce or neutralize contamination in aerosols. SEARCH METHODS Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched the following databases on 17 September 2020: Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (in the Cochrane Library, 2020, Issue 8), MEDLINE Ovid (from 1946); Embase Ovid (from 1980); the WHO COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease; the US National Institutes of Health Trials Registry (ClinicalTrials.gov); and the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register. We placed no restrictions on the language or date of publication. SELECTION CRITERIA We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) on aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs) performed by dental healthcare providers that evaluated methods to reduce contaminated aerosols in dental clinics (excluding preprocedural mouthrinses). The primary outcomes were incidence of infection in dental staff or patients, and reduction in volume and level of contaminated aerosols in the operative environment. The secondary outcomes were cost, accessibility and feasibility. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors screened search results, extracted data from the included studies, assessed the risk of bias in the studies, and judged the certainty of the available evidence. We used mean differences (MDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) as the effect estimate for continuous outcomes, and random-effects meta-analysis to combine data. We assessed heterogeneity. MAIN RESULTS We included 16 studies with 425 participants aged 5 to 69 years. Eight studies had high risk of bias; eight had unclear risk of bias. No studies measured infection. All studies measured bacterial contamination using the surrogate outcome of colony-forming units (CFU). Two studies measured contamination per volume of air sampled at different distances from the patient's mouth, and 14 studies sampled particles on agar plates at specific distances from the patient's mouth. The results presented below should be interpreted with caution as the evidence is very low certainty due to heterogeneity, risk of bias, small sample sizes and wide confidence intervals. Moreover, we do not know the 'minimal clinically important difference' in CFU. High-volume evacuator Use of a high-volume evacuator (HVE) may reduce bacterial contamination in aerosols less than one foot (~ 30 cm) from a patient's mouth (MD -47.41, 95% CI -92.76 to -2.06; 3 RCTs, 122 participants (two studies had split-mouth design); very high heterogeneity I² = 95%), but not at longer distances (MD -1.00, -2.56 to 0.56; 1 RCT, 80 participants). One split-mouth RCT (six participants) found that HVE may not be more effective than conventional dental suction (saliva ejector or low-volume evacuator) at 40 cm (MD CFU -2.30, 95% CI -5.32 to 0.72) or 150 cm (MD -2.20, 95% CI -14.01 to 9.61). Dental isolation combination system One RCT (50 participants) found that there may be no difference in CFU between a combination system (Isolite) and a saliva ejector (low-volume evacuator) during AGPs (MD -0.31, 95% CI -0.82 to 0.20) or after AGPs (MD -0.35, -0.99 to 0.29). However, an 'n of 1' design study showed that the combination system may reduce CFU compared with rubber dam plus HVE (MD -125.20, 95% CI -174.02 to -76.38) or HVE (MD -109.30, 95% CI -153.01 to -65.59). Rubber dam One split-mouth RCT (10 participants) receiving dental treatment, found that there may be a reduction in CFU with rubber dam at one-metre (MD -16.20, 95% CI -19.36 to -13.04) and two-metre distance (MD -11.70, 95% CI -15.82 to -7.58). One RCT of 47 dental students found use of rubber dam may make no difference in CFU at the forehead (MD 0.98, 95% CI -0.73 to 2.70) and occipital region of the operator (MD 0.77, 95% CI -0.46 to 2.00). One split-mouth RCT (21 participants) found that rubber dam plus HVE may reduce CFU more than cotton roll plus HVE on the patient's chest (MD -251.00, 95% CI -267.95 to -234.05) and dental unit light (MD -12.70, 95% CI -12.85 to -12.55). Air cleaning systems One split-mouth CCT (two participants) used a local stand-alone air cleaning system (ACS), which may reduce aerosol contamination during cavity preparation (MD -66.70 CFU, 95% CI -120.15 to -13.25 per cubic metre) or ultrasonic scaling (MD -32.40, 95% CI - 51.55 to -13.25). Another CCT (50 participants) found that laminar flow in the dental clinic combined with a HEPA filter may reduce contamination approximately 76 cm from the floor (MD -483.56 CFU, 95% CI -550.02 to -417.10 per cubic feet per minute per patient) and 20 cm to 30 cm from the patient's mouth (MD -319.14 CFU, 95% CI - 385.60 to -252.68). Disinfectants ‒ antimicrobial coolants Two RCTs evaluated use of antimicrobial coolants during ultrasonic scaling. Compared with distilled water, coolant containing chlorhexidine (CHX), cinnamon extract coolant or povidone iodine may reduce CFU: CHX (MD -124.00, 95% CI -135.78 to -112.22; 20 participants), povidone iodine (MD -656.45, 95% CI -672.74 to -640.16; 40 participants), cinnamon (MD -644.55, 95% CI -668.70 to -620.40; 40 participants). CHX coolant may reduce CFU more than povidone iodine (MD -59.30, 95% CI -64.16 to -54.44; 20 participants), but not more than cinnamon extract (MD -11.90, 95% CI -35.88 to 12.08; 40 participants). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS We found no studies that evaluated disease transmission via aerosols in a dental setting; and no evidence about viral contamination in aerosols. All of the included studies measured bacterial contamination using colony-forming units. There appeared to be some benefit from the interventions evaluated but the available evidence is very low certainty so we are unable to draw reliable conclusions. We did not find any studies on methods such as ventilation, ionization, ozonisation, UV light and fogging. Studies are needed that measure contamination in aerosols, size distribution of aerosols and infection transmission risk for respiratory diseases such as COVID-19 in dental patients and staff.","Kumbargere Nagraj, Sumanth; Eachempati, Prashanti; Paisi, Martha; Nasser, Mona; Sivaramakrishnan, Gowri; Verbeek, Jos H",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd013686.pub2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33047816/,134

Despite technical improvements, incomplete reperfusion remains the final angiographic result in 40% of patients according to recent trials. As most incomplete reperfusions are caused by distal vessel occlusions, they are potentially amenable to rescue strategies. While observational data suggest a net benefit of up to 20% in functional independence of incomplete versus complete reperfusions, the net benefit of secondary improvement from Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction 2b to 3 reperfusion might differ due to lengthier procedures and delayed reperfusion. Current strategies to tackle distal vessel occlusions consist of distal (microcatheter) aspiration, small adjustable stent retrievers, and administration of intra-arterial thrombolytics. While there are promising reports evaluating those techniques, all available studies show relevant limitations in terms of selection bias, single-center design, or nonconsecutive patient inclusion. Besides an assessment of risks associated with rescue maneuvers, we advocate that the decision-making process should also include a consideration of potential outcomes if complete reperfusion would successfully be achieved. These include (1) a futile angiographic improvement (hypoperfused territory is already infarcted), (2) an unnecessary angiographic improvement (the patient would not have developed infarction if no rescue maneuver was performed), and (3) a successful rescue maneuver with clinical benefit. Currently there is paucity of data on how these scenarios can be predicted and the decision whether to treat or to stop in a patient with incomplete reperfusion involves many unknowns. To advance the status quo, we outline current knowledge gaps and avenues of potential research regarding this clinically important question.","Kaesmacher, Johannes; Ospel, Johanna M; Meinel, Thomas R; Boulouis, Grégoire; Goyal, Mayank; Campbell, Bruce C V; Fiehler, Jens; Gralla, Jan; Fischer, Urs",Stroke,https://doi.org/10.1161/strokeaha.120.030157; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32993461/,134

Health systems are under extreme pressure because of the outbreak. Pediatric population seems to be less prone to develop a severe course of the disease. Still the information about COVID-19 infection and children affected by cancer are few. AIM This survey aims to highlight preventive and control measures to manage COVID-19 infection in Italian Pediatric Oncology and Hematology Association (AIEOP) centers. METHODS A multicenter, descriptive survey design was used. All the AIEOP centers were invited to complete an on-line survey. Data collection was performed between March 15, 2020 and April 15, 2020. RESULTS Thirty six out of 48 centers responded to the survey. All the centers implemented similar preventive measures in order to control the COVID-19 spread and 77.8% of centers have created structured pathways, specific protocols or procedures; 30% of centers reduced the number of inpatient beds and 90% outpatient activity. The prevalence data collected report 14 children positive and 35 healthcare professionals positive. DISCUSSION COVID-19 is not spreading homogeneously in Italy and children are less infected. It will be necessary to define new processes and new strategies to ensure safety and continuity of care to children affected by cancer, even in the future, when the lockdown will end, and new measures will be implemented.","Amicucci, Matteo; Canesi, Marta; Rostagno, Elena; Bergadano, Anna; Badino, Clara; Botta, Debora; Fenicia, Diana; Longo, Antonella; Macchi, Simone; Ricciardi, Celeste; Crotti Partel, Moreno",Professioni infermieristiche,https://doi.org/10.7429/pi.2020.734270; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33780611/,134

A randomized clinical trial.,2014,"BACKGROUND Postoperative delirium in the intensive care unit (ICU) is a frequent complication after cardiac or thoracic surgery and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. METHODS In this single-center substudy of the BAG-RECALL trial (NCT00682825), we screened patients after cardiac or thoracic surgery in the ICU twice daily for delirium using the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU. The primary outcome was the incidence of delirium in patients who had been randomized to intraoperative Bispectral Index (BIS)-guided and end-tidal anesthetic concentration-guided depth of anesthesia protocols. As a secondary analysis, a Bayesian stochastic search variable selection strategy was used to rank a field of candidate risk factors for delirium, followed by binary logistic regression. RESULTS Of 310 patients assessed, 28 of 149 (18.8%) in the BIS group and 45 of 161 (28.0%) in the end-tidal anesthetic concentration group developed postoperative delirium in the ICU (odds ratio 0.60, 95% confidence interval, 0.35-1.02, P= 0.058). Low average volatile anesthetic dose, intraoperative transfusion, ASA physical status, and European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation were identified as independent predictors of delirium. CONCLUSIONS A larger randomized study should determine whether brain monitoring with BIS or an alternative method decreases delirium after cardiac or thoracic surgery. The association between low anesthetic concentration and delirium is a surprising finding and could reflect that patients with poor health are both more sensitive to the effects of volatile anesthetic drugs and are also more likely to develop postoperative delirium. Investigation of candidate methods to prevent delirium should be prioritized in view of the established association between postoperative delirium and adverse patient outcomes.","Whitlock, Elizabeth L; Torres, Brian A; Lin, Nan; Helsten, Daniel L; Nadelson, Molly R; Mashour, George A; Avidan, Michael S",Anesthesia and analgesia,https://doi.org/10.1213/ane.0000000000000028; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24413548/,134

Based on an initial and early experience, single-incision laparoscopic appendectomy (LA) was found to be technically advantageous for dealing with appendicitis in unusual anatomical locations. This study aims to highlight the technical advantages of single-incision laparoscopic surgery in dealing with the abnormally located appendixes and furthermore report a case of acute appendicitis occurring in a sub-gastric position, which is probably the first such case to be reported in English literature. MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective analysis of the first 10 cases of single-incision LA which were performed by a single surgeon is presented here. RESULTS There were seven females and three males. The mean age of the patients was 30.6 (range 18-52) years, mean BMI was 22.7 (range 17-28) kg/m(2) and the mean operative time was 85.5 (range 45-150) min. The mean postoperative stay was 3.6 (range 1-7) days. The commonest position of the appendix was retro-caecal (50%) followed by pelvic (30%). In three cases the appendix was found to be in abnormal locations namely sub-hepatic, sub-gastric and deep pelvic or para-vesical or para-rectal. All these cases could be managed with this technique without any conversions. CONCLUSION Single-incision laparoscopic surgery appears to be a feasible and safe technique for dealing with appendicitis in rare anatomical locations. Appendectomy may be a suitable procedure for the initial training in single-incision laparoscopic surgery.","Zachariah, Sanoop K",Journal of minimal access surgery,https://doi.org/10.4103/0972-9941.107128; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23626414/,134

Those with existing comorbidities and minority ethnic groups have been found to be at increased risk of mortality. We wished to determine if there were any differences in intensive care unit (ICU) admission and 30-day hospital mortality in a city with high levels of deprivation and a large community of people of South Asian heritage. Methods: Detailed information on 622 COVID-19-positive inpatients in Bradford and Calderdale between February-August 2020 were extracted from Electronic Health Records. Logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards models were used to explore the relationship between ethnicity with admission to ICU and 30-day mortality, respectively accounting for the effect of demographic and clinical confounders. Results: The sample consisted of 408 (70%) White, 142 (24%) South Asian and 32 (6%) other minority ethnic patients. Ethnic minority patients were younger, more likely to live in deprived areas, and be overweight/obese, have type 2 diabetes, hypertension and asthma compared to white patients, but were less likely to have cancer (South Asian patients only) and COPD. Male and obese patients were more likely to be admitted to ICU, and patients of South Asian ethnicity, older age, and those with cancer were less likely. Being male, older age, deprivation, obesity, and cancer were associated with 30-day mortality. The risk of death in South Asian patients was the same as in white patients HR 1.03 (0.58, 1.82). Conclusions: Despite South Asian patients being less likely to be admitted to ICU and having a higher prevalence of diabetes and obesity, there was no difference in the risk of death compared to white patients. This contrasts with other findings and highlights the value of studies of communities which may have different ethnic, deprivation and clinical risk profiles.","Santorelli, Gillian; McCooe, Michael; Sheldon, Trevor A; Wright, John; Lawton, Tom",Wellcome open research,https://doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.16580.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34522788/,134

Self-assembly of chemical vapor deposition grown 2D WS2 monolayer into quasi-1D van der Waals scroll structure instigates a plethora of unique physiochemical properties significantly different from its 2D counterparts. The physical properties of such nanoscrolls can be greatly manipulated upon hybridizing them with high-quantum-yield colloidal quantum dots, forming 0D/2D structures. The efficient dissociation of excitons at the heterojunctions of QD/2D hybridized nanoscrolls exhibits a 3000-fold increased photosensitivity compared to the pristine 2D-material-based nanoscroll. The synergistic effects of confined geometry and efficient QD scatterers produce a nanocavity with multiple feedback loops, resulting in coherent lasing action with an unprecedentedly low lasing threshold. Predominant localization of the excitons along the circumference of this helical scroll results in a 12-fold brighter emission for the parallel-polarized transition compared to the perpendicular one, as confirmed by finite-difference time-domain simulation. The versatility of hybridized nanoscrolls and their unique properties opens up a powerful route for not-yet-realized devices toward practical applications.","Ghosh, Rapti; Lin, Hung-I; Chen, Yu-Siang; Singh, Mukesh; Yen, Zhi-Long; Chiu, Shengkuei; Lin, Hsia-Yu; Bera, Krishna P; Liao, Yu-Ming; Hofmann, Mario; Hsieh, Ya-Ping; Chen, Yang-Fang",Small,https://doi.org/10.1002/smll.202003944; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33079462/,134

This situation demands a productive solution for face mask (FM) waste management to solve several associated environmental issues. In the current study, a novel soil treatment method is proposed for the improvement of mechanical characteristics of fat clay by using FM as fiber reinforcement and silica fume (SF) as the cementitious agent in the form of a composite binary admixture (CBA). The performance of the proposed CBA is compared with SF and FM as the lone stabilizers by conducting extensive geotechnical testing. The SF treatment exponentially improves the strength characteristics of soil but it marginalizes the ductility of soil, inviting sudden failure and instability under dynamic loadings. It is observed that the proposed CBA not only improves the strength characteristics more than SF but also regulates the ductility and deformability of treated soil due to the presence of FM fibers. In addition, the policies and protocols on the logistics of collecting FM waste and making it ready for the proposed geotechnical application are reviewed; associated health risks, socioeconomic conditions and available technologies are the major governing factors to formulate and implement these policies. Moreover, the prolonged storage of COVID-19 FM waste for disinfection is found to be suitable for the proposed soil stabilization method as per the literature.

There were 579 encounters for patients <18 years of age and 476 unique patients. METHODS In addition to ICD10 code and pre/post school closing, each encounter was identified to be inpatient, outpatient and/or emergency department. Demographic data such as age, gender, ethnicity, and race were extracted. Incident rate ratios in addition to descriptive statistics, Mann-Whitney U test, two-sample t-test, or the chi-square test of association were used in the analysis. RESULTS No significant differences were identified for total rates of child abuse and neglect encounters (p = .08), physical abuse (p = .91) nor child maltreatment (p = .86) codes or in the age (p = .46), gender (p = .58), and race/ethnicity (p = .15) of patient encounters pre- versus post-school closings. The sexual abuse incidence and inpatient encounters increased by 85% (IRR = 1.85, p < .0001; IRR = 1.85, p = .004, respectively). CONCLUSIONS Our findings provide a unique contribution to the existing literature in that we identified a significant increase in the incidence of sexual abuse and higher patient acuity as evidenced by higher rates of inpatient encounters after school closing due to SARS-Cov-2.","Salt, Elizabeth; Wiggins, Amanda T; Cooper, Gena L; Benner, Kalea; Adkins, Brian W; Hazelbaker, Katherine; Rayens, Mary Kay",Child abuse & neglect,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chiabu.2021.105132; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34082194/,134

However, in recent years, recombinant adenoviral and poxviral vectored vaccines have been optimized to induce B-cell responses, resulting in the demonstration of high-titer antibody responses in a wide variety of animal species. These approaches have now been translated, confirming the induction of substantial levels of antigen-specific IgG in a series of Phase I human clinical trials targeting HIV-1 and Plasmodium falciparum malaria. To further improve the induction of antibodies, mixed-modality regimens based on recombinant viral and protein/adjuvant vaccines are now being assessed. However, limited data exist about the underlying mechanisms mediating the induction of B-cell responses by these subunit vaccines and their ability to influence the qualitative aspects of vaccine-induced B-cell populations and immunoglobulin. Future studies in this area are needed to guide the rational design of antibody-inducing subunit vaccine strategies.","de Cassan, Simone C; Draper, Simon J",Expert review of vaccines,https://doi.org/10.1586/erv.13.11; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23560918/,134

We aimed to estimate the total number of COVID-19 related infections, deaths, and hospitalizations in Iran under different physical distancing and isolation scenarios. METHODS We developed a susceptible-exposed-infected/infectious-recovered/removed (SEIR) model, parameterized to the COVID-19 pandemic in Iran. We used the model to quantify the magnitude of the outbreak in Iran and assess the effectiveness of isolation and physical distancing under five different scenarios (A: 0% isolation, through E: 40% isolation of all infected cases). We used Monte-Carlo simulation to calculate the 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs). RESULTS Under scenario A, we estimated 5 196 000 (UI 1 753 000-10 220 000) infections to happen till mid-June with 966 000 (UI 467 800-1 702 000) hospitalizations and 111 000 (UI 53 400-200 000) deaths. Successful implantation of scenario E would reduce the number of infections by 90% (ie, 550 000) and change the epidemic peak from 66 000 on June 9, to 9400 on March 1, 2020. Scenario E also reduces the hospitalizations by 92% (ie, 74 500), and deaths by 93% (ie, 7800). CONCLUSION With no approved vaccination or therapy available, we found physical distancing and isolation that include public awareness and case-finding and isolation of 40% of infected people could reduce the burden of COVID-19 in Iran by 90% by mid-June.","Sharifi, Hamid; Jahani, Yunes; Mirzazadeh, Ali; Ahmadi Gohari, Milad; Nakhaeizadeh, Mehran; Shokoohi, Mostafa; Eybpoosh, Sana; Tohidinik, Hamid Reza; Mostafavi, Ehsan; Khalili, Davood; Hashemi Nazari, Seyed Saeed; Karamouzian, Mohammad; Haghdoost, Ali Akbar",International journal of health policy and management,https://doi.org/10.34172/ijhpm.2020.134; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32772007/,134

119175,Reentry to Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery During the COVID19 Pandemic.,2020-05-29,"The COVID-19 pandemic has abruptly halted the Anthropocene's ever-expanding reign for the time being. The resulting global human confinement, dubbed as the Anthropause, has created an unprecedented opportunity for us to evaluate the environmental consequences of large-scale changes in anthropogenic activities. Based on a methodical and in-depth review of related literature, this study critically evaluates the positive and negative externalities of COVID-19 induced lockdown on environmental components including air, water, noise, waste, forest, wildlife, and biodiversity. Among adverse impacts of the lockdown, increased amount of healthcare waste (300-400%), increased level of atmospheric ozone (30-300%), elevated levels of illicit felling in forests and wildlife poaching were prominent. Compared to the negative impacts, significant positive changes in various quality parameters related to key environmental components were evident. Positive impacts on air quality, water quality, noise level, waste generation, and wildlife were apparent in varying degrees as evaluated in this study. By presenting a critical overview of the recommendations given in the major literature in light of these documented impacts, this paper alludes to potential policy reforms as a guideline for future sustainable environmental management planning. Some of the key recommendations are e.g., enhance remote working facilities, cleaner design, use of internet of things, automation, systematic lockdown, and inclusion of hazardous waste management in disaster planning. The summarized lessons of this review, pertinent to the dynamic relationship between anthropogenic activities and environmental degradation, amply bring home the need for policy reforms and prioritization of Sustainable Development Goals in the context of the planetary boundaries to the environmental sustainability for a new post-pandemic world.","Chowdhury, Rubel Biswas; Khan, Ayushi; Mahiat, Tashfia; Dutta, Hillol; Tasmeea, Tahana; Binth Arman, Afra Bashira; Fardu, Farzin; Roy, Bidhan Bhuson; Hossain, Mohammad Mosharraf; Khan, Niaz Ahmed; Amin, A T M Nurul; Sujauddin, Mohammad",The Science of the total environment,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.147015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34088121/,134

DESIGN Cross-sectional study. ANIMALS 100 dogs evaluated at an open-admission municipal animal shelter in Florida. PROCEDURES Fecal samples were collected within 24 hours after admission from 50 dogs with normal feces and 50 dogs with diarrhea. Feces were tested by fecal flotation, antigen testing, PCR assay, and electron microscopy for selected enteropathogens. RESULTS 13 enteropathogens were identified. Dogs with diarrhea were significantly more likely to be infected with ≥ 1 enteropathogens (96%) than were dogs with normal feces (78%). Only Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin A gene was significantly more common in dogs with diarrhea (64%) than in dogs with normal feces (40%). Other enteropathogens identified in dogs with and without diarrhea included hookworms (58% and 48%, respectively), Giardia spp (22% and 16%, respectively), canine enteric coronavirus (2% and 18%, respectively), whipworms (12% and 8%, respectively), Cryptosporidium spp (12% and 2%, respectively), ascarids (8% and 8%, respectively), Salmonella spp (2% and 6%, respectively), Cystoisospora spp (2% and 4%, respectively), canine distemper virus (8% and 0%, respectively), Dipylidium caninum (2% and 2%, respectively), canine parvovirus (2% and 2%, respectively), and rotavirus (2% and 0%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Dogs entered the shelter with a variety of enteropathogens, many of which are pathogenic or zoonotic. Most infections were not associated with diarrhea or any specific dog characteristics, making it difficult to predict the risk of infection for individual animals. Guidelines for preventive measures and empirical treatments that are logistically and financially feasible for use in shelters should be developed for control of the most common and important enteropathogens.","Tupler, Tiffany; Levy, Julie K; Sabshin, Stephanie J; Tucker, Sylvia J; Greiner, Ellis C; Leutenegger, Christian M",Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association,https://doi.org/10.2460/javma.241.3.338; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22812470/,134
119707,Prognostic indicators of short-term outcome in dogs undergoing surgery for brachycephalic obstructive airway syndrome.,2020-08-06,"Most head and neck cancers are derived from the mucosal epithelium in the oral cavity, pharynx and larynx and are known collectively as head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Oral cavity and larynx cancers are generally associated with tobacco consumption, alcohol abuse or both, whereas pharynx cancers are increasingly attributed to infection with human papillomavirus (HPV), primarily HPV-16. Thus, HNSCC can be separated into HPV-negative and HPV-positive HNSCC. Despite evidence of histological progression from cellular atypia through various degrees of dysplasia, ultimately leading to invasive HNSCC, most patients are diagnosed with late-stage HNSCC without a clinically evident antecedent pre-malignant lesion. Traditional staging of HNSCC using the tumour-node-metastasis system has been supplemented by the 2017 AJCC/UICC staging system, which incorporates additional information relevant to HPV-positive disease. Treatment is generally multimodal, consisting of surgery followed by chemoradiotherapy (CRT) for oral cavity cancers and primary CRT for pharynx and larynx cancers. The EGFR monoclonal antibody cetuximab is generally used in combination with radiation in HPV-negative HNSCC where comorbidities prevent the use of cytotoxic chemotherapy. The FDA approved the immune checkpoint inhibitors pembrolizumab and nivolumab for treatment of recurrent or metastatic HNSCC and pembrolizumab as primary treatment for unresectable disease. Elucidation of the molecular genetic landscape of HNSCC over the past decade has revealed new opportunities for therapeutic intervention. Ongoing efforts aim to integrate our understanding of HNSCC biology and immunobiology to identify predictive biomarkers that will enable delivery of the most effective, least-toxic therapies.","Johnson, Daniel E; Burtness, Barbara; Leemans, C René; Lui, Vivian Wai Yan; Bauman, Julie E; Grandis, Jennifer R",Nature reviews.

OBJECTIVE To investigate whether a peripherally implanted polymer drug depot can deliver a dose of etanercept sufficient to reduce thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia in a rat model of neuropathic pain. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA TNF-alpha inhibitors reduce pain-associated behavior in experimental models of neuropathic pain. Moreover, systemic injections of TNF-alpha inhibitors have suggested some efficacy in treating sciatic pain in limited, off-label clinical studies. Improvements in these results may be obtained by optimal dosing via targeted, sustained delivery at the site of disc-induced inflammation. METHODS Unilateral chronic constriction injury was applied to the sciatic nerve of 56 male, Wistar rats. Four groups of animals (n = 7) received 0.5 mL phosphate-buffered saline every 3 days, 0.3 or 3 mg/kg etanercept every 3 days, or gabapentin (60 mg/kg) 1 hour before each behavioral test all via subcutaneous injection. Two groups of animals received 1.5 or 3.0 microg/h etanercept delivered by poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) millicylinders (1 mm diameter x 10 mm long) implanted near the injured sciatic nerve. One group received a PLGA millicylinder implanted near the injured sciatic nerve. The final group received 3.0 microg/h etanercept via PLGA millicylinder implanted next to the uninjured, contralateral sciatic nerve. RESULTS A low, local dose of etanercept (approximately 3 microg/h) delivered by a polymer depot significantly reduced (P < 0.05) thermal hyperalgesia for 57 days as compared to polymer depot without drug or an etanercept-loaded depot implanted near the contralateral sciatic nerve, and equivalent to a 10-fold higher dose delivered by repeat subcutaneous injection. CONCLUSION This preclinical study indicates that delivering TNF-alpha inhibitors by means of a locally administered polymeric formulation provides long-lasting analgesia in an inflammatory neuropathic pain model.","Zanella, John M; Burright, Eric N; Hildebrand, Keith; Hobot, Chris; Cox, Mark; Christoferson, Laura; McKay, William F",Spine,https://doi.org/10.1097/brs.0b013e318162340a; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18303453/,134
121082,Utilization of a novel valveless trocar system during robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy.,2015,"BACKGROUND Coronaviruses have caused outbreaks of respiratory disease since the beginning of the 21st century, representing a significant threat to public health. Together, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), the respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and, more recently, the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) have caused hundreds of thousands of deaths around the world. Thus, investments in research and the development of strategies aimed at diagnosing, treating, and preventing these infections are urgently needed. OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to analyze the patents that address pathogenic coronaviruses in Google Patents databases in the last year (2019-2020). METHOD The search strategy was carried out in April 2020, based on the keywords ""SARS"", ""SARS-CoV"", ""MERS"", ""MERS-CoV"", ""SARS-CoV-2"" and ""COVID-19. Out of the patents examined, 25 were selected for a short description in this study. RESULTS A total of 191 patents were analyzed, 149 of which were related to SARS-CoV, and 29 and 12 were related to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV2, respectively. The patents addressed the issues of diagnosis, therapeutic agents, prevention and control, along with other applications.

Rapamycin (RAPA) induced autophagy had been reported to limit the progression of hepatocellular injury in experimental models. This research was designed to study two death pathways involved in ACRL induced hepatotoxicity and the modulating effect of RAPA on the resulting hepatic injury. Thirty-six adult male rats were divided into three groups: control group, ACRL treated group (20 mg/kg/day), and the last group co-treated with ACRL plus RAPA (0.5 mg/kg/day). Drugs were administered for 21 days via oral gavage. Blood samples were collected to assess alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Livers were dissected; parts were used for detection of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA) tissue levels. Other parts were processed for hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), Masson's trichrome staining, immunostaining for microtubule-associated proteins 1A/1B light chain 3B (LC3), ubiquitin-binding protein (p62), caspase-3, and receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1). ACRL induced a significant elevation in ALT, AST, MDA levels, and reduction in the SOD level. ACRL also induced hepatocellular injury, fibrosis, and defective autophagy indicated by elevation of LC3 and p62 and increased p62/LC3 ratio. Moreover, it increased the apoptotic (caspase-3) and necroptotic (RIPK1) markers expression. RAPA significantly reduced liver enzymes, oxidative stress, fibrosis, and improved liver histology. Moreover, RAPA decreased p62/LC3 ratio indicated enhanced autophagy, and significantly reduced caspase-3 and RIPK1 expression. In conclusion, RAPA maintained autophagc activity which may save the hepatocytes from PCD and enhance cell viability. This article is protected by copyright.

Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is increasingly used worldwide but is still used with skepticism in the elderly. The purpose of our analysis is to judge the security of LSG in patients older than 60 years compared to patients younger than 60 years. METHODS This retrospective review included data of all patients in Germany who underwent LSG between January 2005 and December 2016.The data were published online in the German Bariatric Surgery Registry. A total of 21,571 operations were gathered and divided into two groups: group I, patients < 60 years old; and group II, patients ≥ 60 years old. RESULTS The total number of patients and the mean body mass index of group I and group II was 19,786, 51.7 ± 9.5 kg/m2 and 1771, 49.2 ± 8.1 kg/m2, respectively. Regarding comorbidities, group II suffered statistically significantly more comorbidities than group I (p < 0.001). The general postoperative complications were 4.9% in group I and 7.8% in group II (p < 0.001). There was no significant difference in special postoperative complications (p = 0.048) and a slightly higher intraoperative complication rate in group II (2.2% vs. 1.6%, p = 0.048). Thirty-day mortality rate for group I versus II was 0.22% and 0.23% (p = 0.977), respectively.

Methods Between January 2005 and December 2015, data of 32 patients (16 males, 16 females; mean age 58.1±10.9 years; range, 45 to 73 years) who were diagnosed with acute type A aortic dissection and underwent repair with a history of previous cardiac surgery at our institution were retrospectively analyzed. The patients were divided into two groups as those with a history of prior coronary artery bypass grafting (n=16) and the patients with a previous cardiac surgery without prior coronary artery bypass grafting (n=16). Results Dissection of the ascending aorta occurred in 32 patients (late acute in 22 and late chronic in 10) who underwent previous cardiac surgery (aortic valve replacement in 12, mitral valve replacement in two, aortic valve replacement + coronary artery bypass grafting in two, coronary artery bypass grafting in 10, mitral valve replacement + coronary artery bypass grafting in four, and dual valve replacement in two patients). The mean time between the first operation and dissection was 4.0±1.5 years. Dissections were treated with the Bentall procedures (n=8), ascending aorta replacement (n=14), ascending aorta replacement + hemiarch replacement (n=4), ascending aorta + aortic valve replacement (n=4) and Bentall + arch replacement (n=2). In-hospital mortality (30-day mortality) was seen in five patients, and oneyear mortality rate was 21.85% (n=7). The survival rates of the all patients for primary cardiac surgery vs primary cardiac surgery + coronary artery bypass grafting were 81.25% vs 75% at one year, 75% vs 68.75% at three years,75% vs 56.25% at five years, 68.75% vs 56.25% at seven years, and 68.75% vs 56.25% at 10 years, respectively (p=0.71, CI: 95%). Conclusion Type-A aortic dissections may develop after cardiac operations with or without coronary artery bypass grafting at any time, and irrespective of associated histologies, they may result in high overall in-hospital mortality. With careful planning by prompt intervention, the outcomes in redo sternotomy operations with or without coronary artery bypass grafting for aortic dissections would be consistent the results of spontaneous aortic dissections.","Özçınar, Evren; Çakıcı, Mehmet; Baran, Çağdaş; Gümüş, Fatih; Özgür, Alper; Yazıcıoğlu, Levent; Kaya, Bülent; Akar, Ahmet Rüçhan",Turk gogus kalp damar cerrahisi dergisi,https://doi.org/10.5606/tgkdc.dergisi.2018.14683; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32082704/,134
123254,Peri-operative management of anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy in gastrointestinal surgery.,2014,"Maternal nutritional status influences fetal development and long-term risk for adult non-communicable diseases. However, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. We examined whether biomarkers for metabolism and inflammation during pregnancy were associated with maternal health and with child biomarkers and health at 9-12 years of age in 44 maternal-child dyads from the Supplementation with Multiple Micronutrients Intervention Trial (SUMMIT, ISRCTN34151616) in Lombok, Indonesia. Archived blood for each dyad from maternal enrollment, later in pregnancy, postpartum, and from children at 9-12 years comprised 132 specimens. Multiplex microbead immunoassays were used to quantify vitamin D-binding protein (D), adiponectin (A), retinol-binding protein 4 (R), C-reactive protein (C), and leptin (L). Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed distinct variance patterns, i.e. principal components (PC), for baseline pregnancy, bp.pc1.D↓A↓R↓ and bp.pc2.C↓L↑; combined follow-up during pregnancy and postpartum, dp-pp.pc1.D↑↓A↑R↑↓L↓ and dp-pp.pc2.A↑C↑L↑; and children, ch.pc1.D↑R↑C↑ and ch.pc2.D↓A↑L↑. Maternal multiple micronutrient (MMN) supplementation led to an association of baseline maternal bp.pc2.C↓L↑ with decreased post-supplementation maternal dp-pp.pc2.A↑C↑L↑ (p = 0.022), which was in turn associated with both increased child ch.pc1.D↑R↑C↑ (p = 0.036) and decreased child BMI z-score (BMIZ) (p = 0.022). Further analyses revealed an association between maternal dp-pp.pc1.D↑↓A↑R↑↓L↓ and increased child BMIZ (p = 0.036). Child ch.pc1.D↑R↑C↑ was associated with decreased birth weight (p = 0.036) and increased child BMIZ (p = 0.002). Child ch.pc2.D↓A↑L↑ was associated with increased child BMIZ (p = 0.005), decreased maternal height (p = 0.030) and girls (p = 0.002). A pattern of elevated maternal adiponectin and leptin in pregnancy was associated with increased C-reactive protein, vitamin A, and D binding proteins pattern in children, suggesting biomarkers acting in concert may have qualitative as well as quantitative influence beyond single biomarker effects. Patterns in pregnancy proximal to birth were more associated with child status. In addition, child patterns were more associated with child status, particularly child BMI. MMN supplementation affects maternal biomarker patterns of metabolism and inflammation in pregnancy, and potentially in the child. However, child nutrition conditions after birth may have a greater impact on metabolism and inflammation.","Priliani, Lidwina; Oktavianthi, Sukma; Prado, Elizabeth L; Malik, Safarina G; Shankar, Anuraj H",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0216848; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764747/,134
123303,In vitro quantification of strain patterns in the craniofacial skeleton due to masseter and temporalis activities.,2012,"The paper examines the effects of anaesthesia on circulatory physiology and their implications regarding improvement in perioperative anaesthetic management. Changes to current anaesthetic practice, recommended recently, such as the use of flow monitoring in high risk patients, are already beginning to have an impact in reducing complications but not mortality [1]. Better understanding of the patho-physiology should help improve management even further. Analysis of selected individual clinical trials has been used to illustrate particular areas of patho-physiology and how changes in practice have improved outcome. There is physiological support for the importance of achieving an appropriate rate of oxygen delivery (DO2), particularly following induction of anaesthesia. It is suggested that ensuring adequate DO2 during anaesthesia will avoid development of oxygen debt and hence obviate the need to induce a high, compensatory, DO2 in the post-operative period. In contrast to the usual assumptions underlying strategies requiring a global increase in blood flow [1] by a stroke volume near maximization strategy, blood flow control actually resides entirely at the tissues not at the heart. This is important as the starting point for understanding failed circulatory control as indicated by 'volume dependency'. Local adjustments in blood flow at each individual organ - auto-regulation - normally ensure the appropriate local rate of oxygen supply, i.e. local DO2. Inadequate blood volume leads to impairment of the regulation of blood flow, particularly in the individual tissues with least capable auto-regulatory capability. As demonstrated by many studies, inadequate blood flow first occurs in the gut, brain and kidney. The inadequate blood volume which occurs with induction of anaesthesia is not due to blood volume loss, but probably results from redistribution due to veno-dilation. The increase in venous capacity renders the existing blood volume inadequate to maintain venous return and pre-load. Blood volume shifted to the veins will, necessarily, also reduce the arterial volume. As a result stroke volume and cardiac output fall below normal with little or no change in peripheral resistance. The resulting pre-load dependency is often successfully treated with colloid infusion and, in some studies, 'inotropic' agents, particularly in the immediate post-operative phase. Treatment during the earliest stage of anaesthesia can avoid the build up of oxygen debt and may be supplemented by drugs which maintain or restore venous tone, such as phenylephrine; an alternative to volume expansion. Interpretation of circulatory patho-physiology during anaesthesia confirms the need to sustain appropriate oxygen delivery. It also supports reduction or even elimination of supplementary crystalloid maintenance infusion, supposedly to replace the ""mythical"" third space loss. As a rational evidence base for future research it should allow for further improvements in anaesthetic management.","Wolff, Christopher B; Green, David W",International journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijsu.2014.10.034; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25448657/,134

123861,Weight recidivism post-bariatric surgery: a systematic review.,2013,"BACKGROUND Rates of parastomal hernia following stoma formation remain high. Previous systematic reviews suggested that prophylactic mesh reduces the rate of parastomal hernia; however, a larger trial has recently called this into question. The aim was to determine whether mesh placed at the time of primary stoma creation prevents parastomal hernia. METHODS The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL were searched using medical subject headings for parastomal hernia, mesh and prevention. Reference lists of identified studies, clinicaltrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry were also searched. All randomized clinical trials were included. Two authors extracted data from each study independently using a purpose-designed sheet. Risk of bias was assessed by a tool based on that developed by Cochrane. RESULTS Ten randomized trials were identified among 150 studies screened. In total 649 patients were included in the analysis (324 received mesh). Overall the rates of parastomal hernia were 53 of 324 (16·4 per cent) in the mesh group and 119 of 325 (36·6 per cent) in the non-mesh group (odds ratio 0·24, 95 per cent c.i. 0·12 to 0·50; P < 0·001). Mesh reduced the rate of parastomal hernia repair by 65 (95 per cent c.i. 28 to 85) per cent (P = 0·02). There were no differences in rates of parastomal infection, stomal stenosis or necrosis. Mesh type and position, and study quality did not have an independent effect on this relationship. CONCLUSION Mesh placed prophylactically at the time of stoma creation reduced the rate of parastomal hernia, without an increase in mesh-related complications.","Cross, A J; Buchwald, P L; Frizelle, F A; Eglinton, T W",The British journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1002/bjs.10402; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28004850/,134

A comprehensive search of MEDLINE and EMBASE was performed for papers published between 1 January 2020 and 21 April 2020. Two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts and subsequently full texts for eligibility in this systematic review. The search yielded 2504 citations published between January and February 2020 or an unspecified date, 109 of which remained for extraction after screening. Data extracted included study design, year of publication, country of basis, journal of publication, impact factor of publishing journal, study sample size, number of citations and topic of investigation.

124064,Robotic laparoendoscopic single-site radical prostatectomy: technique and early outcomes.,2010,"Population bottlenecks can have major effects in the evolution of RNA viruses, but their possible influence in the evolution of DNA viruses is largely unknown. Genetic and biological variation of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) has been studied by subjecting 23 biological clones of the virus to 10 plaque-to-plaque transfers. In contrast to large population passages, plaque transfers led to a decrease in replicative capacity of HSV-1. Two out of a total of 23 clones did not survive to the last transfer in 143 TK(-) cells. DNA from three genomic regions (DNA polymerase, glycoprotein gD and thymidine kinase) from the initial and passaged clones was sequenced. Nucleotide substitutions were detected in the TK and gD genes, but not in the DNA polymerase gene. Assuming a uniform distribution of mutations along the genome, the average rate of fixation of mutations was about five mutations per viral genome and plaque transfer. This value is comparable to the range of values calculated for RNA viruses. Four plaque-transferred populations lost neurovirulence for mice, as compared with the corresponding initial clones. LD(50) values obtained with the populations subjected to serial bottlenecks were 4- to 67-fold higher than for their parental clones. These results equate HSV-1 with RNA viruses regarding fitness decrease as a result of plaque-to-plaque transfers, and show that population bottlenecks can modify the pathogenic potential of HSV-1. Implications for the evolution of complex DNA viruses are discussed.","Jaramillo, Nacarí; Domingo, Esteban; Muñoz-Egea, María Carmen; Tabarés, Enrique; Gadea, Ignacio",The Journal of general virology,https://doi.org/10.1099/vir.0.044685-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23100362/,134
124471,Single-access laparoscopic rectal surgery is technically feasible.,2013,"Gastric cancer with metastases outside of the regional lymph nodes is deemed oncologically unresectable. Nevertheless, some metastatic lesions are technically resectable by applying established surgical techniques such as para-aortic lymphadenectomy and hepatectomy. At the time of compilation of the Japanese gastric cancer treatment guidelines version 4, systematic reviews were conducted to see whether it is feasible to make any recommendation to dissect both the primary and metastatic lesions with intent to cure, possibly as part of multimodality treatment. Long-term survivors were found among carefully selected groups of patients both in prospective and retrospective studies. In addition, there is a growing list of publications reporting encouraging outcomes of gastrectomy conducted after exceptionally good response to chemotherapy, usually among patients who underwent R0 resection. This type of surgery is often referred to as conversion surgery. It is sometimes difficult to define a clear borderline between curative surgery scheduled after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and the conversion surgery. This review summarizes what we knew after the literature reviews conducted at the time of compiling the Japanese guidelines and in addition reflects some new findings obtained thereafter through clinical trials and retrospective studies. Metastases were divided into three categories based on the major metastatic pathways: lymphatic, hematogenous, and peritoneal. In each of these categories, there were findings that could provide hope for patients with metastatic disease. These findings implied that the surgical technique that we already use could become more useful upon further developments in antineoplastic agents and drug delivery.","Kodera, Yasuhiro",Annals of gastroenterological surgery,https://doi.org/10.1002/ags3.12191; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30238074/,134

125479,German S3 guideline: anal abscess.,2012,"We assessed the long-term incidence of fractures after stroke and TIA and analyzed associated factors. The fracture incidence increases with age and is higher in stroke than in TIA. Dementia is associated with fractures after both. Our results indicate tailored measures are necessary for preventing fractures after stroke or TIA. INTRODUCTION In the present study, we aimed to assess the long-term incidence of fractures and analyze associated factors after stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). METHODS The current cohort study included patients who had received an initial ischemic stroke or TIA diagnosis documented anonymously in the Disease Analyzer database (IQVIA) between 2000 and 2016 by physicians in 1262 general practices in Germany. Univariate Cox and multivariate regression models were carried out. RESULTS Three groups (stroke, TIA, no stroke/TIA), each with 12,265 individuals, were selected (mean age 67.3 years, 48.1% female). A fracture was diagnosed in 12.9% of stroke patients and in 11.4% of TIA patients. Among male stroke patients, 11.1% had a fracture (15.4% among female stroke patients). The hazard ratio (HR) for fractures after stroke was 1.26 (CI: 1.15-1.39) and for fractures after TIA, it was 1.14 (CI: 1.03-1.25). In female stroke patients, the HR for fractures was 1.32 (CI: 1.15-1.60), while in males, it was 1.20 (CI: 1.03-1.39). Among TIA patients, females had an elevated HR for fractures (HR: 1.21; CI: 1.06-1.37). In individuals aged ≥ 80 years, an increased risk for fractures was only detected among TIA patients (HR: 1.26; CI: 1.05-1.51). Dementia and non-opioid analgesic therapy were positively associated with fracture after both stroke and TIA. CONCLUSION Stroke was positively associated with fracture in patients < 80 years, while TIA was positively associated with fracture in patients ≥ 80 years and females. Dementia and analgesic therapy were also associated with fracture after either stroke or TIA.","Tanislav, C; Kostev, K",Osteoporosis international : a journal established as result of cooperation between the European Foundation for Osteoporosis and the National Osteoporosis Foundation of the USA,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00198-020-05535-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32647951/,134

127004,JHL News.,2017,"MLK3 (mixed lineage kinase 3) is a MAP3K [MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) kinase kinase] that activates multiple MAPK pathways, including the JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase) pathway. Immunoblotting of lysates from cells ectopically expressing active MLK3 revealed an additional immunoreactive band corresponding to a CTF (C-terminal fragment) of MLK3. In the present paper we provide evidence that MLK3 undergoes proteolysis to generate a stable CTF in response to different stimuli, including PMA and TNFalpha (tumour necrosis factor alpha). The cleavage site was deduced by Edman sequencing as between Gln251 and Pro252, which is within the kinase domain of MLK3. Based on our homology model of the kinase domain of MLK3, the region containing the cleavage site is predicted to reside on a flexible solvent-accessible loop. Site-directed mutagenesis studies revealed that Leu250 and Gln251 are required for recognition by the 'MLK3 protease', reminiscent of the substrate specificity of the coronavirus 3C and 3CL proteases. Whereas numerous mammalian protease inhibitors have no effect on MLK3 proteolysis, blockade of the proteasome through epoxomicin or MG132 abolishes PMA-induced production of the CTF of MLK3. This CTF is able to heterodimerize with full-length MLK3, and interact with the active form of the small GTPase Cdc42, resulting in diminished activation loop phosphorylation of MLK3 and reduced signalling to JNK. Thus this novel proteolytic processing of MLK3 may negatively control MLK3 signalling to JNK.","Liou, Geou-Yarh; Zhang, Hua; Miller, Eva M; Seibold, Steve A; Chen, Weiqin; Gallo, Kathleen A",The Biochemical journal,https://doi.org/10.1042/bj20091077; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20158498/,134

However, dilute ferrofluids pose an additional challenge compared to concentrated ones. Migration of the magnetic nanoparticles towards a magnet is not well counteracted by a buildup of an osmotic pressure gradient, and consequently, homogeneity of the fluid is gradually lost. Here, we investigate this phenomenon by measuring and numerically modelling time-dependent concentration profiles in aqueous ferrofluids in the field of a neodymium magnet and at 10 T in a Bitter magnet. The numerical model incorporates magnetic, frictional, and osmotic forces on the particles and takes into account the polydispersity of the particles and the spatial dependence of magnetic field. The magnetic sedimentation rate in our most stable ferrofluids can be understood in terms of the magnetophoresis of separate nanoparticles, a best-case scenario when it comes to applications.","van Silfhout, Alex M; Engelkamp, Hans; Erné, Ben H",The journal of physical chemistry.

Materials and methods We review a case series of percutaneous AVF banding procedures for DASS and high-output cardiac failure to illustrate the technique and limitations of this technique. Results Two representative cases from our local experience were selected to illustrate the technique in a stepwise manner. Both cases were performed for DASS, with good technical success. However, clinical success was limited in one case due to underlying arterial insufficiency. The technique, selection of appropriate banding diameter for flow reduction, limitations and complications of alternative surgical techniques are discussed. Conclusions Percutaneous AVF banding is a relatively straightforward and effective minimally-invasive technique for treatment of DASS supported by short-intermediate term data.","Kok, Hong Kuan; Maingard, Julian; Asadi, Hamed; Ryan, Elizabeth; Sheehan, Mark; Given, Mark F; Lee, Michael J",CVIR endovascular,https://doi.org/10.1186/s42155-018-0035-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30652158/,134

By simultaneously tracking the position of the cell body and the configuration of its flagella, we demonstrate that individual run modes show different chemotactic responses in nutrition gradients and, thus, constitute distinct behavioral states. On the basis of an active particle model, we demonstrate that switching between multiple run states that differ in their speed and responsiveness provides the basis for robust and efficient chemotaxis in complex natural habitats.","Alirezaeizanjani, Zahra; Großmann, Robert; Pfeifer, Veronika; Hintsche, Marius; Beta, Carsten",Science advances,https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aaz6153; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32766440/,134

To better study the pathophysiology of this complex phenomenon, there is a need for animal models of localised thrombosis at sites of atherosclerotic lesions with closer resemblance to the human pathology as compared to commonly used thrombosis models in healthy vessels. In the present study, we describe and compare a new model of thrombosis induced by atherosclerotic plaque rupture in the carotid artery from ApoE-/- mice using a suture needle to a milder model of ultrasound-induced plaque injury. Needle injury induces atherosclerotic plaque rupture with exposure of plaque material and formation of a thrombus that is larger, nearly occlusive and more stable as compared to that formed by application of ultrasounds. These two models have common features such as the concomitant involvement of platelet activation, thrombin generation and fibrin formation, which translates into sensitivity toward both antiplatelet drugs and anticoagulants. On the other hand, they display differences with respect to the role of the platelet collagen receptor GPVI, the plaque rupture model being less sensitive to its inhibition as compared to the ultrasound-induced injury, which may be related to the amount of thrombin generated. These models represent an improvement as compared to models in healthy vessels and may help identify specific plaque triggers of thrombosis. They should therefore be useful to evaluate new antithrombotic targets.","Hechler, Béatrice; Gachet, Christian",Thrombosis and haemostasis,https://doi.org/10.1160/ths10-11-0730; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21479341/,134

Concentrating on single core symptoms that are biologically well understood might consist of a more viable approach. The Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework is a trans-diagnostic dimensional approach that focuses on symptoms and their underlying neurobiology. Evidence is accumulating that psychedelics may possess antidepressant activity, and this can potentially be explained through a multi-level (psychobiological, circuitry, (sub)cellular and molecular) analysis of the cognitive systems RDoC domain. Cognitive deficits, such as negative emotional processing and negativity bias, often lead to depressive rumination. Psychedelics can increase long-term cognitive flexibility, leading to normalization of negativity bias and reduction in rumination. We propose a theoretical model that explains how psychedelics can reduce the negativity bias in depressed patients. At the psychobiological level, we hypothesize that the negativity bias in MDD is due to impaired pattern separation and that psychedelics such as psilocybin help in depression because they enhance pattern separation and hence reduce negativity bias. Pattern separation is a mnemonic process that relies on adult hippocampal neurogenesis, where similar inputs are made more distinct, which is essential for optimal encoding of contextual information. Impairment in this process may underlie the negative cognitive bias in MDD by, for example, increased pattern separation of cues with a negative valence that can lead to excessive deliberation on aversive outcomes. On the (sub) cellular level, psychedelics stimulate hippocampal neurogenesis as well as synaptogenesis, spinogenesis and dendritogenesis in the prefrontal cortex. Together, these effects help restoring resilience to chronic stress and lead to modulation of the major connectivity hubs of the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala. Based on these observations, we propose a new translational framework to guide the development of a novel generation of therapeutics to treat the cognitive symptoms in MDD.","Magaraggia, Igor; Kuiperes, Zilla; Schreiber, Rudy",Neurobiology of learning and memory,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nlm.2021.107467; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34048913/,134

METHODS a multicenter observational study based on the records of the 3 hospitals of the South East health service in Santiago, Chile. We recorded the number of patients admitted for ischemic stroke between 01 January 2020 and 30 June 2020. We grouped the cases into two periods, pre-pandemic and pandemic, according to the setting of the state of emergency in Chile. RESULTS 431 patients were admitted with ischemic stroke during the study period. There was a non-significant decrease in weekly admissions (17 vs 15 patients per week). No differences were observed in the proportion of patients with medical treatment (p = 0.810), IVT (p = 0.638), EVT (p = 0.503) or IVT + EVT (p = 0.501). There was a statistically significant increase in the NIHSS on admission (7.23 vs 8.78, p = 0.009) and mortality (5.2% vs 12.4%, p = 0.012). In a multivariate analysis the NIHSS on admission was associated with the increased mortality (RR 1.11, CI 1.04-1.19, p = 0.003). CONCLUSION We found an increase in the severity of ischemic stroke on admission and in-hospital mortality during the pandemic period.

Multiple logistic regression was used to correlate prestroke CHA2DS2-VASc and severity of stroke, as well as disability and mortality at 90 days. RESULTS Of the 1020 patients included in the analysis, 606 patients had an admission NIHSS score lower and 414 patients higher than 10. At 90 days, 510 patients had mRS ≥3. A linear correlation was found between the prestroke CHA2DS2-VASc score and severity of stroke (P = .001). On multivariate analysis, CHA2DS2-VASc score correlated with severity of stroke (P = .041) and adverse functional outcome (mRS ≥3) (P = .001). A logistic regression with the receiver operating characteristic graph procedure (C-statistics) evidenced an area under the curve of .60 (P = .0001) for severe stroke. Furthermore, a correlation was found between prestroke CHA2DS2-VASc score and lesion size. CONCLUSIONS In patients with AF, in addition to the risk of stroke, a high CHA2DS2-VASc score was independently associated with both stroke severity at onset and disability and mortality at 90 days.","Acciarresi, Monica; Paciaroni, Maurizio; Agnelli, Giancarlo; Falocci, Nicola; Caso, Valeria; Becattini, Cecilia; Marcheselli, Simona; Rueckert, Christina; Pezzini, Alessandro; Morotti, Andrea; Costa, Paolo; Padovani, Alessandro; Csiba, Laszló; Szabó, Lilla; Sohn, Sung-Il; Tassinari, Tiziana; Abdul-Rahim, Azmil H; Michel, Patrik; Cordier, Maria; Vanacker, Peter; Remillard, Suzette; Alberti, Andrea; Venti, Michele; D'Amore, Cataldo; Scoditti, Umberto; Denti, Licia; Orlandi, Giovanni; Chiti, Alberto; Gialdini, Gino; Bovi, Paolo; Carletti, Monica; Rigatelli, Alberto; Putaala, Jukka; Tatlisumak, Turgut; Masotti, Luca; Lorenzini, Gianni; Tassi, Rossana; Guideri, Francesca; Martini, Giuseppe; Tsivgoulis, Georgios; Vadikolias, Kostantinos; Liantinioti, Chrissoula; Corea, Francesco; Del Sette, Massimo; Ageno, Walter; De Lodovici, Maria Luisa; Bono, Giorgio; Baldi, Antonio; D'Anna, Sebastiano; Sacco, Simona; Carolei, Antonio; Tiseo, Cindy; Imberti, Davide; Zabzuni, Dorjan; Doronin, Boris; Volodina, Vera; Consoli, Domenico; Galati, Franco; Pieroni, Alessio; Toni, Danilo; Monaco, Serena; Baronello, Mario Maimone; Barlinn, Kristian; Pallesen, Lars-Peder; Kepplinger, Jessica; Bodechtel, Ulf; Gerber, Johannes; Deleu, Dirk; Melikyan, Gayane; Ibrahim, Faisal; Akhtar, Naveed; Mosconi, Maria Giulia; Lees, Kennedy R",Journal of stroke and cerebrovascular diseases : the official journal of National Stroke Association,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2017.02.011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28236595/,134

However, clinical laboratory metrics suggest key differences in these pathologies. We sought to determine whether plasma coagulation and fibrinolytic potential in patients with COVID-19 differ compared with healthy donors and critically ill patients with sepsis. Approach and Results: We performed comparative studies on plasmas from a single-center, cross-sectional observational study of 99 hospitalized patients (46 with COVID-19 and 53 with sepsis) and 18 healthy donors. We measured biomarkers of endogenous coagulation and fibrinolytic activity by immunoassays, thrombin, and plasmin generation potential by fluorescence and fibrin formation and lysis by turbidity. Compared with healthy donors, patients with COVID-19 or sepsis both had elevated fibrinogen, d-dimer, soluble TM (thrombomodulin), and plasmin-antiplasmin complexes. Patients with COVID-19 had increased thrombin generation potential despite prophylactic anticoagulation, whereas patients with sepsis did not. Plasma from patients with COVID-19 also had increased endogenous plasmin potential, whereas patients with sepsis showed delayed plasmin generation. The collective perturbations in plasma thrombin and plasmin generation permitted enhanced fibrin formation in both COVID-19 and sepsis. Unexpectedly, the lag times to thrombin, plasmin, and fibrin formation were prolonged with increased disease severity in COVID-19, suggesting a loss of coagulation-initiating mechanisms accompanies severe COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS Both COVID-19 and sepsis are associated with endogenous activation of coagulation and fibrinolysis, but these diseases differently impact plasma procoagulant and fibrinolytic potential. Dysregulation of procoagulant and fibrinolytic pathways may uniquely contribute to the pathophysiology of COVID-19 and sepsis.","Bouck, Emma G; Denorme, Frederik; Holle, Lori A; Middelton, Elizabeth A; Blair, Antoinette; de Laat, Bas; Schiffman, Joshua D; Yost, Christian Con; Rondina, Matthew T; Wolberg, Alisa S; Campbell, Robert A","Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology",https://doi.org/10.1161/atvbaha.120.315338; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33196292/,134

MATERIALS AND METHODS Between January 2017 and December 2018, 85 hepatic tumors from 82 patients who underwent percutaneous ablation were included. First, intraprocedural 3D US/CEUS imaging was performed for ablation planning. Then, fusion imaging of 3D US/CEUS with real-time US/CEUS was used to guide the implementation of the plan, immediately evaluate the technical success and indicate the need for supplemental ablation. In addition, contrast-enhanced CT/MR imaging was performed 1 month after the procedure to evaluate the presence of residual tumors, and follow-up scans were repeated every 3 months. RESULTS The average liver tumor diameter was 28 ± 9 mm (range, 10-55 mm). 3D US/CEUS-based planning was successfully conducted in all 85 tumors with a 100% technical success rate of planning. The immediate evaluation by 3D CEUS/US-CEUS fusion imaging showed a 100% technical success rate of ablation. The 1-month CT/MR scans found a residual tumor in one intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma patient; the technique efficacy rate was 98.8%. The median follow-up period was 21.5 months (IQR: 4-36 months). During the follow-up period, the local tumor progression rate was 5.9% (5/84), and no major procedure-related complications occurred. CONCLUSIONS Ablation planning based on 3D US/CEUS-US/CEUS fusion imaging is feasible for liver tumors.","You, Yujia; Zhang, Man; Li, Kai; Zeng, Qingjing; Luo, Liping; Long, Yinglin; Tan, Lei; He, Xuqi; Liang, Ping; Xu, Erjiao; Zheng, Rongqin",Abdominal radiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00261-020-02909-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33484284/,134
130801,Single-port hysterectomy: robotic versus laparoscopic.,2018,"BACKGROUND Although the proper use of hygiene and personal protective equipment (PPE) is paramount for preventing the spread of diseases such as COVID-19, health care personnel have been shown to use incorrect techniques for donning/doffing of PPE and hand hygiene, leading to a large number of infections among health professionals. Education and training are difficult owing to the social distancing restrictions in place, shortages of PPE and testing material, and lack of evidence on optimal training. Virtual reality (VR) simulation can offer a multisensory, 3-D, fully immersive, and safe training opportunity that addresses these obstacles. OBJECTIVE The aim of this study is to explore the short- and long-term effectiveness of a fully immersive VR simulation versus a traditional learning method regarding a COVID-19-related skill set and media-specific variables influencing training outcomes. METHODS This was a prospective, randomized controlled pilot study on medical students (N=29; intervention VR training, n=15, vs control video-based instruction, n=14) to compare the performance of hand disinfection, nasopharyngeal swab taking, and donning/doffing of PPE before and after training and 1 month later as well as variables of media use. RESULTS Both groups performed significantly better after training, with the effect sustained over one month. After training, the VR group performed significantly better in taking a nasopharyngeal swab, scoring a median of 14 out of 17 points (IQR 13-15) versus 12 out of 17 points (IQR 11-14) in the control group, P=.03. With good immersion and tolerability of the VR simulation, satisfaction was significantly higher in the VR group compared to the control group (median score of User Satisfaction Evaluation Questionnaire 27/30, IQR 23-28, vs 22/30, IQR 20-24, in the control group; P=.01). CONCLUSIONS VR simulation was at least as effective as traditional learning methods in training medical students while providing benefits regarding user satisfaction. These results add to the growing body of evidence that VR is a useful tool for acquiring simple and complex clinical skills.","Birrenbach, Tanja; Zbinden, Josua; Papagiannakis, George; Exadaktylos, Aristomenis K; Müller, Martin; Hautz, Wolf E; Sauter, Thomas Christian",JMIR serious games,https://doi.org/10.2196/29586; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34623315/,134
131184,Multicentre experience with extralevator abdominoperineal excision for low rectal cancer.,2010,"The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) utilizes host proteases for virus entry into lung cells. In the current study, Vero cells constitutively expressing type II transmembrane serine protease (Vero-TMPRSS2 cells) showed larger syncytia at 18 h after infection with MERS-CoV than after infection with other coronaviruses. Furthermore, the susceptibility of Vero-TMPRSS2 cells to MERS-CoV was 100-fold higher than that of non-TMPRSS2-expressing parental Vero cells. The serine protease inhibitor camostat, which inhibits TMPRSS2 activity, completely blocked syncytium formation but only partially blocked virus entry into Vero-TMPRSS2 cells. Importantly, the coronavirus is thought to enter cells via two distinct pathways, one mediated by TMPRSS2 at the cell surface and the other mediated by cathepsin L in the endosome. Simultaneous treatment with inhibitors of cathepsin L and TMPRSS2 completely blocked virus entry into Vero-TMPRSS2 cells, indicating that MERS-CoV employs both the cell surface and the endosomal pathway to infect Vero-TMPRSS2 cells. In contrast, a single camostat treatment suppressed MERS-CoV entry into human bronchial submucosal gland-derived Calu-3 cells by 10-fold and virus growth by 270-fold, although treatment with both camostat and (23,25)-trans-epoxysuccinyl-L-leucylamindo-3-methylbutane ethyl ester, a cathepsin inhibitor, or treatment with leupeptin, an inhibitor of cysteine, serine, and threonine peptidases, was no more efficacious than treatment with camostat alone. Further, these inhibitors were not efficacious against MERS-CoV infection of MRC-5 and WI-38 cells, which were derived from lung, but these characters differed from those of mature pneumocytes. These results suggest that a single treatment with camostat is sufficient to block MERS-CoV entry into a well-differentiated lung-derived cell line.","Shirato, Kazuya; Kawase, Miyuki; Matsuyama, Shutoku",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01890-13; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24027332/,134

Yet, most microbes within plants appear to be uncultivable, and for those that can be cultivated, their metabolic potential lies largely hidden through regulatory silencing of biosynthetic genes. The recent explosion of powerful interdisciplinary approaches, including multi-omics methods to address multi-trophic interactions and artificial intelligence-based computational approaches to infer distribution of function, together present a paradigm shift in high-throughput approaches to natural product discovery from plant-associated microbes. Arguably, the key to characterizing and harnessing this biochemical capacity depends on a novel, systematic approach to characterize the triggers that turn on secondary metabolite biosynthesis through molecular or genetic signals from the host plant, members of the rich 'in planta' community, or from the environment. This review explores breakthrough approaches for natural product discovery from plant microbiomes, emphasizing the promise of deep learning as a tool for endophyte bioprospecting, endophyte biochemical novelty prediction, and endophyte regulatory control. It concludes with a proposed pipeline to harness global databases (genomic, metabolomic, regulomic, and chemical) to uncover and unsilence desirable natural products.

This study compared the effect of a theory-based educational leaflet, based on the Health Action Process Approach (HAPA), and action planning intervention with a standard government information leaflet designed to increase influenza vaccination uptake among high-risk Thai adults. DESIGN A controlled before and after trial was conducted. Participants in the intervention (n = 99) received a leaflet based on the HAPA and asking them to form an action plan identifying where, when, and how they would seek vaccination. Those in the comparison condition (n = 102) received a standard government information leaflet. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES There are 2 sets of outcome measures: (a) process measures of HAPA related variables taken at T1 and T2, and (b) vaccination rates during the subsequent 2 months. RESULTS The HAPA intervention resulted in greater changes on measures of risk perception, outcome expectancies, self-efficacy, and intention than the comparison condition. Stronger intentions to obtain vaccination were explained by changes in outcome expectancies, perceived self-efficacy for arranging time and transportation, and planning. No significant difference in vaccination rates was observed between two groups. Influenza vaccination was directly predicted by self-efficacy and intention. CONCLUSION Results demonstrate that a HAPA-based leaflet may be a useful tool to enhance individual's vaccination intention, but larger trials are required to confirm these findings.","Payaprom, Yupares; Bennett, Paul; Alabaster, Erica; Tantipong, Hutsaya","Health psychology : official journal of the Division of Health Psychology, American Psychological Association",https://doi.org/10.1037/a0023580; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21534678/,134

However, because of the LeCompte maneuver, there may be a propensity for development of pulmonary artery stenosis. We encountered atypical complications of pulmonary artery stenting in patients after the ASO, including aorto-pulmonary fistula and coronary compression. METHODS We performed a 10-year retrospective review of catheterizations performed in patients after ASO in our institution with a focus on adverse events. RESULTS Diagnostic and interventional catheterizations were performed in 47 patients. In 29 patients, 37 interventional procedures performed, which included pulmonary artery angioplasty and/or stenting. In this group, there were five major adverse events (14%), including three aorto-pulmonary fistulae and one coronary artery compression among patients having stent implantation or stent redilation. In addition, there were 6/37 (16%) intended stent procedures, which were aborted because there appeared to be high-risk of significant adverse events. CONCLUSIONS This review suggests that percutaneous intervention on pulmonary artery stenosis after ASO has high-risk and should be undertaken advisedly. Prior thorough evaluation of coronary arteries is mandatory as coronary reimplantation sites may be adjacent to sites of pulmonary artery stenosis. Furthermore, if pulmonary artery stent implantation or stent redilation is contemplated, the risk of stent fracture and possible AP fistula should be recognized. Primary use of reinforced covered stents should be considered.","Lee, Jesse; Abdullah Shahbah, Doaa; El-Said, Howaida; Rios, Rodrigo; Ratnayaka, Kanishka; Moore, John",Congenital heart disease,https://doi.org/10.1111/chd.12726; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30620141/,134

132792,Proficiency training on a virtual reality robotic surgical skills curriculum.,2014,"Patients with a diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) suffer disabilities and are at increased risk for lower extremity amputation. Current standard of care includes debridement, topical antibiotics, and weight off-loading-still resulting in low rates of healing. Previous small-scale research has indicated that repeated remote ischemic conditioning (rRIC) is a novel modality that delivers significantly higher DFU healing rates. This proof-of-concept study was performed to expand the research on the utility of rRIC as an adjunctive treatment in the healing of chronic DFUs. Forty subjects (41 wounds) received rRIC treatment three times weekly in addition to standard of care for 12 weeks. Subjects that did not heal in this time frame but had a significant reduction in wound size were eligible to continue for an 8-week extension period. By the end of the extension period, 31 of the 41 DFU wounds (75.6%) in this study were determined to be healed. This compares favourably to the 25-30% standard of care average healing rate. For additional comparison, another group of patients receiving standard of care alone, by the same investigator, was selected and matched by wound size at baseline and wound location. For this matching cohort, after 20 weeks of treatment, only 15 of the 41 DFU comparison wounds (36.6%) were determined to be healed, in line with other standard of care results. In the rRIC treatment group, the 10 wounds that did not heal, experienced an average reduction in wound area of 54.3%. The results of this proof-of-concept study reinforce earlier evidence that the addition of rRIC to local wound care significantly improves the healing of chronic diabetic foot ulcers.","Regulski, Matthew; Greenwood, Todd; Leschinsky, Boris",Wound repair and regeneration : official publication of the Wound Healing Society [and] the European Tissue Repair Society,https://doi.org/10.1111/wrr.12956; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34236750/,134

METHODS We prototyped microwires with different diameters (0.0120 inch, 0.0115 inch, 0.0110 inch), materials, and construction methods (coil-on-core, extruded polymer jacket-on-core). Under fluoroscopic guidance and using femoral artery access, the microwires were navigated into the internal carotid artery of male Wistar rats (n=50, weight 376±64 g) to induce MCAo for 1 or 2 h. We performed neurological assessments at baseline, and at 3, 24, 72, and 168 h after MCAo. MRI measurements were performed on a 9.4 T scanner at 1 and 7 days post-injury. RESULTS The 0.0115 inch microwire with polymer jacket-on-core provided the most successful outcome. At 1 and 7 days post-injury, we observed similar infarction volumes for 1 and 2 h MCAo in the MRI study. Infarcted lesion volumes in both MCAo groups were significantly reduced at 7 days compared with 1 day post-injury. The trend in longitudinal changes for the scores of different neurological assessments was confirmed to be significant after the injury, but both groups showed a similar trend of neurological deficits over the course of the study. CONCLUSIONS We have developed a reliable and repeatable MCAo method in rats, allowing for precise occlusion of the MCA under direct fluoroscopic visualization without alteration of the cerebral hemodynamics associated with ECA ligation.

Benefits include increased flexibility, enhanced student engagement and satisfaction, and more effective use of time spent during face-to-face teaching. However, the development and implementation of flipped classroom teaching are also associated with challenges, including time required to develop learning materials and getting students to engage with the preparatory work. This teaching tip describes a structured approach to designing and implementing the flipped classroom approach for clinical skills to allow a greater focus on practicing the hands-on skills and the provision of feedback during the laboratory session. First, the rationale for flipping the classroom and the expected benefits should be considered. On a practical level, decisions need to be made about what to include in the flipped component, how it will complement the face-to-face class, and how the resources will be created. In the design phase, adopting a structured template and aligning with established pedagogical principles is helpful. A well-designed flipped classroom motivates learners by including different elements such as quality educational media (e.g., videos), the opportunity to self-assess, and well-defined connections to relevant knowledge and skills. Student engagement with the flipped material can be promoted through different strategies such as clear communication to manage student expectations and adapting the delivery of the face-to-face component.

Communication and interaction between different host cells at the early stage of viral infections determine the quality and magnitude of immune responses against the invading virus. The release of membrane-encapsulated extracellular vesicles (EVs), from host cells, is defined as a refined system of cell-to-cell communication. EVs contain a diverse array of biomolecules, including microRNAs (miRNAs). We hypothesized that the activation of the tracheal cells with different stimuli impacts the cellular and EV miRNA profiles. Chicken tracheal rings were stimulated with polyI:C and LPS from Escherichia coli 026:B6 or infected with low pathogenic avian influenza virus H4N6. Subsequently, miRNAs were isolated from chicken tracheal cells or from EVs released from chicken tracheal cells. Differentially expressed (DE) miRNAs were identified in treated groups when compared to the control group. Our results demonstrated that there were 67 up-regulated miRNAs, 157 down-regulated miRNAs across all cellular and EV samples. In the next step, several genes or pathways targeted by DE miRNAs were predicted. Overall, this study presented a global miRNA expression profile in chicken tracheas in response to avian influenza viruses (AIV) and toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands.

The DE candidate miRNAs, including miR-146a, miR-146b, miR-205a, miR-205b and miR-449, can be investigated further for functional validation studies and to be used as novel prophylactic and therapeutic targets in tailoring or enhancing antiviral responses against AIV.","O'Dowd, Kelsey; Emam, Mehdi; El Khili, Mohamed Reda; Emad, Amin; Ibeagha-Awemu, Eveline M; Gagnon, Carl A; Barjesteh, Neda",Vaccines,https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines8030438; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764349/,134

135922,Minimally invasive treatments for perforator vein insufficiency.,2016,"OBJECTIVES We aimed to develop a systematic synthesis of systematic reviews of health impacts of climate change, by synthesising studies' characteristics, climate impacts, health outcomes and key findings. DESIGN We conducted an overview of systematic reviews of health impacts of climate change. We registered our review in PROSPERO (CRD42019145972). No ethical approval was required since we used secondary data. Additional data are not available. DATA SOURCES On 22 June 2019, we searched Medline, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Embase, Cochrane and Web of Science. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA We included systematic reviews that explored at least one health impact of climate change. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS We organised systematic reviews according to their key characteristics, including geographical regions, year of publication and authors' affiliations. We mapped the climate effects and health outcomes being studied and synthesised major findings. We used a modified version of A MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews-2 (AMSTAR-2) to assess the quality of studies. RESULTS We included 94 systematic reviews. Most were published after 2015 and approximately one-fifth contained meta-analyses. Reviews synthesised evidence about five categories of climate impacts; the two most common were meteorological and extreme weather events. Reviews covered 10 health outcome categories; the 3 most common were (1) infectious diseases, (2) mortality and (3) respiratory, cardiovascular or neurological outcomes. Most reviews suggested a deleterious impact of climate change on multiple adverse health outcomes, although the majority also called for more research. CONCLUSIONS Most systematic reviews suggest that climate change is associated with worse human health. This study provides a comprehensive higher order summary of research on health impacts of climate change. Study limitations include possible missed relevant reviews, no meta-meta-analyses, and no assessment of overlap. Future research could explore the potential explanations between these associations to propose adaptation and mitigation strategies and could include broader sociopsychological health impacts of climate change.","Rocque, Rhea J; Beaudoin, Caroline; Ndjaboue, Ruth; Cameron, Laura; Poirier-Bergeron, Louann; Poulin-Rheault, Rose-Alice; Fallon, Catherine; Tricco, Andrea C; Witteman, Holly O",BMJ open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-046333; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34108165/,134

136289,Clinical features of gastric emptying after distal gastrectomy.,2017,"BACKGROUND The incorporation of Behavioral Change Techniques (BCTs) in eHealth interventions for the management of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), might be a promising approach to improve clinical and behavioral outcomes of NCDs in the long run. This 3paper reports a protocol for a systematic review that aims to (a) identify the effects of individual BCTs in eHealth interventions for lowering glycated hemoglobin levels (HbA1c) and (b) investigate which additional intervention features (duration of intervention, tailoring, theory-base, and mode of delivery) affect levels of HbA1c in this population. The protocol follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P) 2015 guideline. METHODS/DESIGN To identify eligible studies, an extensive systematic database search (PubMed, Web of Science, and PsycINFO) using keywords will be conducted. This review will include randomized controlled trials examining the effects of eHealth interventions on HbA1c in persons with poorly controlled T2DM over a minimum follow-up period of 3 months. Relevant data will be extracted from the included studies using Microsoft Excel. The content of the interventions will be extracted from the description of interventions and will be classified according to the BCT taxonomy v1 tool. The quality of studies will be independently assessed by two reviewers using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. If the studies have adequate homogeneity, meta-analysis will be considered. The effect sizes of each BCT will be calculated using the random effect model. The quality of the synthesized evidence will be evaluated employing the Grading of the Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria. DISCUSSION This systematic review is one of the firsts to appraise the effectiveness of eHealth interventions employing BCTs which aimed at improving glycemic control in persons with poorly controlled T2DM. The review will aggregate the effect sizes of BCTs on HbA1c levels. The results may inform future eHealth interventions targeting poorly controlled T2DM populations.

136395,Minimally invasive radical thymectomy.,2016,"PURPOSE Acute-total and chronic-partial sleep deprivation increase the risks for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Cardiovascular function assessed by flow mediated dilation (FMD) is reduced after sleep deprivation. High-intensity interval exercise (HIIE) improves postprandial FMD. Sleep-deprived individuals may practice HIIE followed by a high-fat breakfast. This study investigated the acute-partial sleep deprivation (APSD) and HIIE interaction on postprandial FMD. METHODS Fifteen healthy males (age 31 ± 5 years) participated in: (a) reference sleep (~ 9.5 h) with no HIIE (RS), (b) RS and HIIE (RSX), and (c) APSD and HIIE (SSX). HIIE was performed in 3:2 min intervals at 90% and 40% of VO2 reserve. FMD was assessed the night before (D1), the morning of the next day (D2), 1 h (1hrPE) and 4 h post HIIE (4hrPE). RESULTS FMD% change was lower at RS compared to both RSX (F1,14 = 23.96, p < 0.001, η2 = 0.631) and SSX (F1,14 = 4.8, p = 0.47, η2 = 0.253) at 1hrPE. RSX and SSX did not differ at 1hrPE (F1,14 = 0.2, p = 0.889, η2 = 0.001), but SSX elicited greater FDM responses. Absolute FMD change was lower at RS compared to both RSX (F1,14 = 21.5, p < 0.001, η2 = 0.606) and SSX (F1,14 = 7.01, p = 0.019, η2 = 0.336) at 1hrPE. RSX and SSX did not differ at 1hrPE (F1,14 = .03, p = 0.858, η2 = 0.002), but SSX elicited greater FDM responses. CONCLUSIONS HIIE short-term effects on cardiovascular function remain cardioprotective even after an acute-partial sleep deprivation.","Papadakis, Zacharias; Forsse, Jeffrey S; Peterson, Matthew N",European journal of applied physiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00421-020-04468-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32803383/,134
136409,Impact of a hands-on component on learning in the Fundamental Use of Surgical Energy™ (FUSE) curriculum: a randomized-controlled trial in surgical trainees.,2014,"Background Given the lack of clear indications for the use of warfarin in the treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF) in patients on hemodialysis and the potential risks that accompany warfarin use in these patients, we systematically reviewed stroke and bleeding outcomes in hemodialysis patients treated with warfarin for AF. Objective To systematically review the stroke and bleeding outcomes associated with warfarin use in the hemodialysis population to treat AF. Design Systematic review. Setting All adult hemodialysis patients. Patients Patients on hemodialysis receiving warfarin for the management of AF. Measurements Any type of stroke and/or bleeding outcomes. Methods MEDLINE(R) In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations and MEDLINE(R) via OVID (1946 to January 11, 2017), and EMBASE via OVID (1974 to January 11, 2017) were searched for relevant literature. Inclusion criteria were randomized controlled trials, observational studies, and case series in English that examined stroke and bleeding outcomes in adult population of patients (over 18 years old) who are on hemodialysis and taking warfarin for AF. Studies with less than 10 subjects, case reports, review articles, and editorials were excluded. Quality of selected articles was assessed using Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). Results Of the 2340 titles and abstracts screened, 7 met the inclusion criteria. Two studies showed an association between warfarin use and an increased risk of stroke (Hazard Ratio: 1.93-3.36) but no association with an increased risk of bleed (HR: 0.85-1.04), while 4 studies showed no association between warfarin and stroke outcomes (HR: 0.12-1.17) but identified an association between warfarin and increased bleeding outcome (HR: 1.41-3.96). And 1 study reported neither beneficial nor harmful effects associated with warfarin use. Limitations The major limitation to this review is that the 7 included studies were observational cohort studies, and thus the outcome measures were not specified and predetermined in a research protocol. Conclusion Our systematic review demonstrated that for patients with AF who are on hemodialysis, warfarin was not associated with reduced outcomes of stroke but was rather associated with increased bleeding events.","Tsai, Chieh; Marcus, Laura Quinn; Patel, Priya; Battistella, Marisa",Canadian journal of kidney health and disease,https://doi.org/10.1177/2054358117735532; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29093823/,134
136449,Lung segmentectomy assisted by highly selective independent segmental ventilation: a series of three cases.,2021-04-15,"BACKGROUND The risk-benefit ratio of left atrial appendage closure (LAAC) versus systemic therapy (warfarin) for prevention of stroke, systemic embolism, and cardiovascular death in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) requires continued evaluation. OBJECTIVES This study sought to assess composite data regarding left atrial appendage closure (LAAC) in 2 randomized trials compared to warfarin for prevention of stroke, systemic embolism, and cardiovascular death in patients with nonvalvular AF. METHODS Our meta-analysis included 2,406 patients with 5,931 patient-years (PY) of follow-up from the PROTECT AF (Watchman Left Atrial Appendage System for Embolic Protection in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation) and PREVAIL (Prospective Randomized Evaluation of the Watchman LAA Closure Device In Patients With Atrial Fibrillation Versus Long Term Warfarin Therapy) trials, and their respective registries (Continued Access to PROTECT AF registry and Continued Access to PREVAIL registry). RESULTS With mean follow-up of 2.69 years, patients receiving LAAC with the Watchman device had significantly fewer hemorrhagic strokes (0.15 vs. 0.96 events/100 patient-years [PY]; hazard ratio [HR]: 0.22; p = 0.004), cardiovascular/unexplained death (1.1 vs. 2.3 events/100 PY; HR: 0.48; p = 0.006), and nonprocedural bleeding (6.0% vs. 11.3%; HR: 0.51; p = 0.006) compared with warfarin. All-cause stroke or systemic embolism was similar between both strategies (1.75 vs. 1.87 events/100 PY; HR: 1.02; 95% CI: 0.62 to 1.7; p = 0.94). There were more ischemic strokes in the device group (1.6 vs. 0.9 and 0.2 vs. 1.0 events/100 PY; HR: 1.95 and 0.22, respectively; p = 0.05 and 0.004, respectively). Both trials and registries identified similar event rates and consistent device effect in multiple subsets. CONCLUSIONS In patients with NVAF at increased risk for stroke or bleeding who are candidates for chronic anticoagulation, LAAC resulted in improved rates of hemorrhagic stroke, cardiovascular/unexplained death, and nonprocedural bleeding compared to warfarin.","Holmes, David R; Doshi, Shephal K; Kar, Saibal; Price, Matthew J; Sanchez, Jose M; Sievert, Horst; Valderrabano, Miguel; Reddy, Vivek Y",Journal of the American College of Cardiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jacc.2015.04.025; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26088300/,134
136716,Minimally Invasive Approach for Resection of Masseteric Vascular Malformations.,2018,"BACKGROUND AND AIM The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of a new microwave ablation (MWA) system, the Emprint Ablation System, for the ablation of unresectable large liver tumors (≥ 30 mm). METHODS Twenty-one hepatic tumors (mean diameter, 34.7 mm) from 21 patients who underwent percutaneous MWA were included in this cross-sectional study. A volume analyzer based on computed tomography imaging was used for all patients within the month before and month after the procedure to evaluate the shape and volume of ablation zones. In addition, computed tomography imaging was performed again 3 months after the procedure to evaluate the presence of residual tumors and local recurrence. RESULTS Mean ablation time was 11.3 min, and mean overall procedure time was 33.4 min. An ablated adrenal gland-induced Takotsubo (stress) cardiomyopathy occurred immediately after MWA as a major complication in one patient. Roundness index A, B, and C presented a mean value of 0.94, 0.94, and 1.01, respectively (all values near 1 is a perfect sphere), indicating that a spherical ablation zone was achieved. The mean ablation volume was larger than the volume of tumors (24.5 vs 41.7 cm3 ). Residual tumors were confirmed in only 4.8% of tumors after a single ablation session. There was no local recurrence. CONCLUSIONS In our experience, the new MWA system provides an effective treatment option for unresectable large liver tumors. However, to ablate the liver tumors safely, it is necessary to consider the surrounding organs, such as the adrenal glands.","Imajo, Kento; Tomeno, Wataru; Kanezaki, Mineo; Honda, Yasushi; Kessoku, Takaomi; Ogawa, Yuji; Yoshida, Keisuke; Yoneda, Masato; Kirikoshi, Hiroyuki; Ono, Masafumi; Kaneta, Tomohiro; Inoue, Tomio; Teratani, Takuma; Saito, Satoru; Nakajima, Atsushi",Journal of gastroenterology and hepatology,https://doi.org/10.1111/jgh.14294; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29851164/,134

137773,Specimen processing during laparoscopic renal surgery: a review of techniques and technologies.,2014,"BACKGROUND The Veterans Choice Program (VCP), aimed at improving access to care, included expanded options for Veterans to receive primary care through community providers. OBJECTIVES The objective of this study was to characterize and compare Veterans use of Veterans Health Administration (VA) primary care services at VA facilities and through a VA community care network (VA-CCN) provider. RESEARCH DESIGN This was a retrospective, observational over fiscal years (FY) 2015-2018. SUBJECTS Veterans receiving primary care services paid for by the VA. MEASURES Veteran demographic, socioeconomic and clinical factors and use of VA primary care services under the VCP each year. RESULTS There were 6.3 million Veterans with >54 million VA primary care visits, predominantly (98.5% of visits) at VA facility. The proportion of VA-CCN visits increased in absolute terms from 0.7% in 2015 to 2.6% in 2018. Among Veterans with any VA-CCN primary care, the proportion of VA-CCN visits increased from 22.6% to 55.3%. Logistic regression indicated that Veterans who were female, lived in rural areas, had a driving distance >40 miles, had health insurance or had a psychiatric/depression condition were more likely to receive VA-CCN primary care. Veterans who were older, identified as Black race, required to pay VA copayments, or had a higher Nosos score, were less likely to receive VA-CCN primary care. CONCLUSION As the VA transitions from the VCP to MISSION and VA facilities gain experience under the new contracts, attention to factors that impact Veterans' use of primary care services in different settings are important to monitor to identify access barriers and to ensure Veterans' health care needs are met.","Hynes, Denise M; Edwards, Samuel; Hickok, Alex; Niederhausen, Meike; Weaver, Frances M; Tarlov, Elizabeth; Gordon, Howard; Jacob, Reside L; Bartle, Brian; O'Neill, Allison; Young, Rebecca; Laliberte, Avery",Medical care,https://doi.org/10.1097/mlr.0000000000001554; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33976079/,134

138021,Anorectal function and outcomes after transanal minimally invasive surgery for rectal tumors.,2015,"BACKGROUND Voice assistants allow users to control appliances and functions of a smart home by simply uttering a few words. Such systems hold the potential to significantly help users with motor and cognitive disabilities who currently depend on their caregiver even for basic needs (eg, opening a door). The research on voice assistants is mainly dedicated to able-bodied users, and studies evaluating the accessibility of such systems are still sparse and fail to account for the participants' actual motor, linguistic, and cognitive abilities. OBJECTIVE The aim of this work is to investigate whether cognitive and/or linguistic functions could predict user performance in operating an off-the-shelf voice assistant (Google Home). METHODS A group of users with disabilities (n=16) was invited to a living laboratory and asked to interact with the system. Besides collecting data on their performance and experience with the system, their cognitive and linguistic skills were assessed using standardized inventories. The identification of predictors (cognitive and/or linguistic) capable of accounting for an efficient interaction with the voice assistant was investigated by performing multiple linear regression models. The best model was identified by adopting a selection strategy based on the Akaike information criterion (AIC). RESULTS For users with disabilities, the effectiveness of interacting with a voice assistant is predicted by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Robertson Dysarthria Profile (specifically, the ability to repeat sentences), as the best model shows (AIC=130.11). CONCLUSIONS Users with motor, linguistic, and cognitive impairments can effectively interact with voice assistants, given specific levels of residual cognitive and linguistic skills. More specifically, our paper advances practical indicators to predict the level of accessibility of speech-based interactive systems. Finally, accessibility design guidelines are introduced based on the performance results observed in users with disabilities.","Masina, Fabio; Orso, Valeria; Pluchino, Patrik; Dainese, Giulia; Volpato, Stefania; Nelini, Cristian; Mapelli, Daniela; Spagnolli, Anna; Gamberini, Luciano",Journal of medical Internet research,https://doi.org/10.2196/18431; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32975525/,134

METHODS In this observational study, we compared the estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) with poor 3-month outcome (modified Rankin Scale scores 3-6), death, and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH) based on the criteria of the European Cooperative Acute Stroke Study II trial. Unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Patients without IVT treatment served as a comparison group. RESULTS Among 4,780 IVT-treated patients, 1,217 (25.5%) had a low GFR (<60 mL/min/1.73 m(2)). A GFR decrease by 10 mL/min/1.73 m(2) increased the risk of poor outcome (OR [95% CI]): (ORunadjusted 1.20 [1.17-1.24]; ORadjusted 1.05 [1.01-1.09]), death (ORunadjusted 1.33 [1.28-1.38]; ORadjusted 1.18 [1.11-1.249]), and sICH (ORunadjusted 1.15 [1.01-1.22]; ORadjusted 1.11 [1.04-1.20]). Low GFR was independently associated with poor 3-month outcome (ORadjusted 1.32 [1.10-1.58]), death (ORadjusted 1.73 [1.39-2.14]), and sICH (ORadjusted 1.64 [1.21-2.23]) compared with normal GFR (60-120 mL/min/1.73 m(2)). Low GFR (ORadjusted 1.64 [1.21-2.23]) and stroke severity (ORadjusted 1.05 [1.03-1.07]) independently determined sICH. Compared with patients who did not receive IVT, treatment with IVT in patients with low GFR was associated with poor outcome (ORadjusted 1.79 [1.41-2.25]), and with favorable outcome in those with normal GFR (ORadjusted 0.77 [0.63-0.94]). CONCLUSION Renal function significantly modified outcome and complication rates in IVT-treated stroke patients. Lower GFR might be a better risk indicator for sICH than age. A decrease of GFR by 10 mL/min/1.73 m(2) seems to have a similar impact on the risk of death or sICH as a 1-point-higher NIH Stroke Scale score measuring stroke severity.","Gensicke, Henrik; Zinkstok, Sanne M; Roos, Yvo B; Seiffge, David J; Ringleb, Peter; Artto, Ville; Putaala, Jukka; Haapaniemi, Elena; Leys, Didier; Bordet, Régis; Michel, Patrik; Odier, Céline; Berrouschot, Jörg; Arnold, Marcel; Heldner, Mirjam R; Zini, Andrea; Bigliardi, Guido; Padjen, Visnja; Peters, Nils; Pezzini, Alessandro; Schindler, Christian; Sarikaya, Hakan; Bonati, Leo H; Tatlisumak, Turgut; Lyrer, Philippe A; Nederkoorn, Paul J; Engelter, Stefan T",Neurology,https://doi.org/10.1212/01.wnl.0000435550.83200.9e; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24122182/,134
138457,Transvesical Robot Assisted Radical Prostatectomy: Initial Experience and Surgical Outcomes.,2020-05-13,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Failure to recanalize predicts mortality in acute ischemic stroke. In the North American Solitaire Acute Stroke registry, we investigated parameters associated with mortality in successfully recanalized patients. METHODS Logistic regression was used to evaluate baseline characteristics and recanalization parameters for association with 90-day mortality. A multivariable model was developed based on backward selection with retention criteria of P<0.05 from factors with at least marginal significance (P≤0.10), then refit to minimize the number of excluded cases (missing data). RESULTS Successfully recanalized patients had lower mortality (25.2% [59/234] versus 46.9% [38/81] P<0.001). There was no difference in symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage between patients with successful versus failed recanalization (9% [21/234] versus 14% [11/79]; P=0.205). However, mortality was significantly higher in patients with symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (72% [23/32] versus 26% [73/281]; P<0.001). Proximal occlusion (internal carotid artery or vertebrobasilar), initial National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale≥18, use of rescue therapy (P<0.05), and 3+ passes (P<0.10) were associated with mortality in recanalized patients. In the multivariate model with good predictive power (c index=0.72), proximal occlusion, initial National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale≥18, and use of rescue therapy remained significant independent predictors of 90-day mortality.

This study is to investigate the clinical settings, antibiotic susceptibility, and visual outcomes of S. pneumoniae endophthalmitis at a tertiary referral center in Taiwan. S. pneumoniae endophthalmitis was diagnosed in 38 eyes of 38 patients. The main clinical features were postcataract endophthalmitis (n = 13, 34%) and endophthalmitis associated with corneal ulcer (n = 12, 32%), trauma (n = 6, 16%), endogenous etiology (n = 4, 11%), trabeculectomy (n = 2, 5%), and pterygium excision-related scleral ulcer (n = 1, 3%). Presenting visual acuity ranged from counting fingers to no light perception. Pars plana vitrectomy with intravitreal antibiotics was performed in 17 eyes (39%) in primary or secondary treatments. S. pneumoniae isolates were susceptible to vancomycin (38/38, 100%), penicillin (37/38, 97%), ceftriaxone (37/38, 97%), cefuroxime (12/15, 80%), levofloxacin (13/15 ,87%), and moxifloxacin (15/17, 88%). Final visual acuity was better than 20/400 in 3 of 38 eyes (8%), 5/200 to hand motions in 3 eyes (8%), and light perception to no light perception in 32 eyes (84%). Ten eyes (26%) underwent evisceration or enucleation. Although S. pneumoniae isolates were susceptible to vancomycin, S. pneumoniae endophthalmitis had a very poor visual prognosis.","Chen, Kuan-Jen; Chong, Ying-Jiun; Sun, Ming-Hui; Chen, Hung-Chi; Liu, Laura; Chen, Yen-Po; Wu, Wei-Chi; Kang, Eugene Yu-Chuan; Lai, Chi-Chun",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-85456-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33737573/,134

This research note analyses differences in contraceptive method mix across Sustainable Development Goal regions and applies assumed method-specific declines in use (from 0 per cent to 20 per cent) to produce an illustrative scenario of the potential impact of COVID-19 on contraceptive use and on the proportion of the need for family planning satisfied by modern methods. Globally, it had been estimated that 77 per cent of women of reproductive age (15-49 years) would have their need for family planning satisfied with modern contraceptive methods in 2020. However, taking into account the potential impact of COVID-19 on method-specific use, this could fall to 71 per cent, resulting in around 60 million fewer users of modern contraception worldwide in 2020. Overall declines in contraceptive use will depend on the methods used by women and their partners and on the types of disruptions experienced. The analysis concludes with the recommendation that countries should include family planning and reproductive health services in the package of essential services and develop strategies to ensure that women and couples are able to exercise their reproductive rights during the COVID-19 crisis.","Dasgupta, Aisha; Kantorová, Vladimíra; Ueffing, Philipp",Gates open research,https://doi.org/10.12688/gatesopenres.13148.2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33330836/,134

The ability to differentiate emotional intensity is a protective factor for psychopathology and in the context of life stressors, poor negative emotion differentiation (ED) is associated with depressive symptoms. However, little is known about whether the ability to recognize negative emotional intensity, a theorized developmental prerequisite of ED, influences the relationship between ACES and depressive symptoms in early childhood. The current study examined the interactive effects of ACES, the ability to recognize emotional intensity and depressive symptoms in 249 preschoolers enriched for depression. Findings demonstrated that when experiencing ACES, sad (not happy) emotion recognition was associated with elevated depressive symptoms. Specifically, when facing multiple ACEs, preschoolers with poor and moderate ability to recognize sad emotional intensity exhibited elevated depressive symptoms. Findings demonstrate that when experiencing elevated ACES, sad emotion recognition may be a protective factor for depression in early childhood.","Sudit, Ella; Luby, Joan; Gilbert, Kirsten",Child psychiatry and human development,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10578-021-01203-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34117580/,134

STUDY DESIGN Case Series. ANIMALS Six dogs and 4 cats. METHODS Medical records of all animals with pleural effusion managed with the PleuralPort device were reviewed. Data regarding signalment, fluid analysis, placement technique, duration of function, duration of implantation, complications, and outcome were collected. Owners and referring veterinarians were contacted for follow-up information. RESULTS Nine animals had chylous effusion and 1 dog had pleural carcinomatosis. Eleven ports were placed with 1 cat receiving bilateral ports. Four animals developed complications. One cat developed pneumothorax immediately after implantation and was euthanatized. In 2 dogs and 1 cat, the ports obstructed. The 6 remaining animals had functioning ports at time of death or resolution of effusion and no longer required use of the port. No significant port migration, irritation, or infection of the device was reported. Excluding the cat with pneumothorax, median duration of port function was 20 days (range 1-391), and median duration of port implantation was 391 days (range 6-723).

Though the pool of ovarian follicles is established during fetal development, impacts of in utero exposures on AMH are uncertain. Thus, we sought to evaluate associations of in utero exposures with AMH of adult daughters with a prospective cohort study of adult daughters at university medical centers. Women noted their mother's reported use of diethylstilbestrol (DES), vitamins, tobacco, alcohol, and caffeine during pregnancy, and their mother's occupation during pregnancy. All participants were reproductive age women (18-40 years) enrolled in the Effects of Aspirin in Gestation and Reproduction (EAGeR) trial. Serum AMH concentrations were measured at baseline prior to conception and categorized using clinical guidelines. Multinomial regression models estimated associations between each exposure and high (>3.5 ng/mL) and low (<1.0 ng/mL) versus normal AMH (1.0-3.5 ng/mL), adjusting for participant's age, mother's age, mother's history of fertility treatment, and mother's use of vitamins. In 1202 women with available data, maternal caffeine use was associated with an increased risk of low AMH, compared to normal (relative risk [RR] 1.90, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.09, 3.30). Vitamins were associated with an increased risk of high AMH compared to normal (RR 1.93, 95% CI 1.24, 3.00). Other exposures were not associated with AMH concentrations in offspring. Maternal caffeine and vitamin use during pregnancy may be associated with ovarian reserve in adult offspring, highlighting the potential importance of pregnancy lifestyle on the reproductive health of daughters.","Eubanks, Allison A; Nobles, Carrie J; Hill, Micah J; DeCherney, Alan H; Kim, Keewan; Sjaarda, Lindsey A; Perkins, Neil J; Ye, Aijun; Zolton, Jessica R; Silver, Robert M; Schisterman, Enrique F; Mumford, Sunni L",Reproductive toxicology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.reprotox.2020.08.015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32916273/,134

However, reading fluency continues to develop during secondary school, when the texts used most are expository texts. METHOD The aim of our study was to investigate reading fluency and reading comprehension in secondary-school students, comparing two texts (i.e. narrative and expository) containing various types of sentences (i.e. declarative, adversative and enumerative sentences). RESULTS We found differences in reading fluency between narrative and expository texts, the expository text being read with a more marked prosody (pauses and melodic contour) suggesting that readers rely on this for their understanding. In addition, we also found a relationship between reading fluency and reading comprehension, with a greater relationship of prosodic variables with the expository text than with the narrative one. CONCLUSIONS Our results confirm that reading fluency continues to develop during secondary school. The expository text, due to its increased difficulty, seemingly needs to lean on and exaggerate the prosody more when reading in order to understand it.","Álvarez-Cañizo, Marta; Cueva, Elena; Cuetos, Fernando; Suárez-Coalla, Paz",Psicothema,https://doi.org/10.7334/psicothema2019.196; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31954419/,134

We developed a modification of OAGB leaving a bridge at the cranial 2 cm of the fundus as a gastro-gastric fistula to allow for endoscopic access to the bypassed stomach. We present the preliminary results of 44 patients who underwent this technique in our hospital. METHODS We analyzed, retrospectively, data collected prospectively on 44 patients who underwent our bridged one-anastomosis gastric bypass (BOAGB) procedure between September, 2018 and November, 2020. RESULTS The mean age of the patients was 45.2 ± 9.3 years (range 20-66 years). The mean preoperative body mass index (BMI), weight, and HbA1c values were 41.5 ± 6.4 kg/m2 (range 35-59), 116 ± 22.7 kg, and 8.2 ± 2.1%, respectively. After a median follow-up period of 18 months (11-26 months), the mean postoperative BMI was 28.4 ± 3.2 kg/m2 (range 21-38), the mean total weight loss was 35.8 ± 13.5 kg (range 20-80 kg), and the mean percentage of excess weight loss (%EWL) and the percentage of total weight loss (%TWL) were 79.8 ± 16.1% (range 47-109) and 30.6 ± 6.9% (range 19-48), respectively. The mean postoperative HbA1c level was 6.3 ± 0.9%. There were two early complications (stenosis and bleeding) and one late complication (marginal ulcer). CONCLUSION Patients who underwent BOAGB lost weight similarly to those who underwent OABG as reported in the literature, without an apparent increase in complications related to the technique.

In this study, we examined the association of the albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) score in patients with mCRC receiving later-line chemotherapy with regorafenib. PATIENTS AND METHODS We retrospectively analyzed data from patients with mCRC treated with regorafenib in a later line between January 2013 and December 2019. Patients were divided into a Normal-ALBI group (ALBI grade 1) and a High-ALBI group (ALBI grades 2 and 3). Primary endpoint was median overall survival (OS) and secondary endpoints were median time to treatment failure (TTF) and incidence of adverse events (AEs). RESULTS Data from 60 patients were analyzed (Normal-ALBI group: 32 patients and High-ALBI group: 28 patients). Median OS [10.23 vs. 3.70 months, hazard ratio (HR): 1.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02-3.13, p = 0.041] and median TTF (2.27 vs. 1.78 months, HR: 1.78, 95%CI 1.02-3.09, p = 0.042) were significantly longer in the Normal-ALBI group than High-ALBI group. On Cox proportional hazard analysis, ALBI score was significantly correlated with OS. The incidence of liver dysfunction (grade ≥ 2) was significantly higher in the High-ALBI than the Normal-ALBI group (42.9% vs. 15.6%, p = 0.041), whereas other AEs were comparable between the two groups. CONCLUSION ALBI was strongly associated with the prognosis of patients with mCRC treated with regorafenib and with the occurrence of liver-related adverse events. These findings may imply that patients with a high ALBI score should not be treated with regorafenib.","Watanabe, Daichi; Fujii, Hironori; Yamada, Yunami; Matsuhashi, Nobuhisa; Makiyama, Akitaka; Iihara, Hirotoshi; Takahashi, Takao; Kiyama, Shigeru; Kobayashi, Ryo; Yoshida, Kazuhiro; Suzuki, Akio",International journal of clinical oncology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10147-021-01910-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33839963/,134

However, data are limited about people's knowledge, attitudes, and practices. Objective To determine knowledge about COVID-19, attitudes towards presidential directives and Ministry of Health (MoH) guidelines, and adherence to practicing public health preventive measures (KAP) in Uganda. Methods This cross-sectional survey was conducted between April 28 and May 19, 2020. Data were collected using online social media platforms, websites, and popular media outlets. We descriptively summarized data and categorized KAP scores as knowledgeable about COVID-19, positive attitude towards presidential directives and MoH guidelines, and adherent to public health preventive measures, respectively. We tested sex differences in KAP using tests of significance and established independently associated factors using modified Poisson regression analysis, reported using adjusted prevalence risk ratio (aPR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Results We studied 362 participants with the following sociodemographic characteristics: 86 (23.8%) aged 25-29 years, 212 (58.6%) males, 270 (74.6%) with tertiary or university levels of education, and 268 (74.0%) urban residents. Of the 362 participants, 264 (93.9%) were knowledgeable about COVID-19 (94.1% males and 93.8% females), 51.3% had positive attitudes towards presidential directives and MoH guidelines (51.0% male and 51.8% female), and 175 (48.3%) were adherent to practicing public health preventive measures (42.9% males and 56.0% females). Compared to males, our data shows that females were more adherent to practicing public health preventive measures (aPR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.01-1.53), knowledgeable about COVID-19 (aPR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.95-1.07), and had positive attitudes towards directives and guidelines (aPR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.82-1.25).

Respite care (RC) is a commonly used short-term inpatient service. The provision of RC can serve as a link between home care and institutional care and can help to stabilize the care provided at home. During RC, the everyday functional skills of PwD can be improved or stabilized through systematic mobility training. However, no specific mobility programme exists for this setting. The aim of the DESKK study was to develop and test a mobility training programme for PwD in the RC setting in Germany. METHODS A quasi-experimental pilot study was conducted in a specialized RC centre for PwD. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected and analysed using a mixed methods design. RESULTS The DESKK mobility programme may be introduced in the RC setting depending on the required time and professional resources. The mobility programme had a high acceptance rate among the staff involved. Ongoing documentation of the mobility exercises were challenging. During their stay (2-4 weeks), the physical function level of the included PwD (n = 20) increased regarding leg strength, gross motor coordination, fine coordination of the fingers and hand strength. CONCLUSIONS The DESKK mobility programme showed a high acceptance rate by the staff and was usable in daily care routine for the most part. These aspects indicate that the programme has the potential to be successfully implemented in the RC setting. The DESKK concept is described in the form of a practice-friendly website to facilitate its use in clinical practice after its successful evaluation.","Heinrich, Steffen; Horstmannshoff, Caren; Holle, Bernhard",BMC geriatrics,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12877-020-01728-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32894055/,134

Given shutdown of exercise facilities, there has been a sharp uptick in a sedentary lifestyle. As people have lost their normal daily activity patterns, it is reasonable to assume that musculoskeletal pain-related syndromes will consequently begin to increase. In addition, there has been a rise in social network, television, and online home-based workouts. In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is unclear whether previous recommendations for physical activities will remain sufficient, given cessation of normal physical activities from day-to-day life.

However, the standard production of pseudovirus based on the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) backbone is an intricate procedure that requires trained laboratory personnel. In this work, a new strategy for creating virus-like proteoliposomes (VLPLs) and virus-like supported bilayers (VLSBs) is presented. This strategy uses a cell blebbing technique to induce the formation of nanoscale vesicles from the plasma membrane of BHK cells expressing the hemagglutinin (HA) fusion protein of influenza X-31. These vesicles and supported bilayers contain HA and are used to carry out single particle membrane fusion events, monitored using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy. The results of these studies show that the VLPLs and VLSBs contain HA proteins that are fully competent to carry out membrane fusion, including the formation of a fusion pore and the release of fluorophores loaded into vesicles. This new strategy for creating spherical and planar geometry virus-like membranes has many potential applications. VLPLs could be used to study fusion proteins of virulent viruses in a safe manner, or they could be used as therapeutic delivery particles to transport beneficial proteins coexpressed in the cells to a target cell. VLSBs could facilitate high throughput screening of antiviral drugs or pathogen-host cell interactions.","Costello, Deirdre A; Hsia, Chih-Yun; Millet, Jean K; Porri, Teresa; Daniel, Susan",Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids,https://doi.org/10.1021/la400861u; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23631561/,134

Hence, there is a need for identifying therapeutic targets to modulate this pathological immune response. Here, we propose a single cell-based computational methodology for predicting proteins to modulate the dysregulated inflammatory response based on the reconstruction and analysis of functional cell-cell communication networks of physiological and pathological conditions. We validated the proposed method in 12 human disease datasets and performed an in-depth study of patients with mild and severe symptomatology of the coronavirus disease 2019 for predicting novel therapeutic targets. As a result, we identified the extracellular matrix protein versican and Toll-like receptor 2 as potential targets for modulating the inflammatory response. In summary, the proposed method can be of great utility in systematically identifying therapeutic targets for modulating pathological immune responses.","Jung, Sascha; Potapov, Ilya; Chillara, Samyukta; Del Sol, Antonio",Science advances,https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.abe5735; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33536217/,134
144560,Transvaginal natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery for adnexal masses.,2013,"PURPOSE The length of Descemet's membrane and donor graft sizes in deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty do not match in very steep corneas, which can lead to Descemet's membrane folds. The aim of this study is to establish a theoretical model for graft size calculations for deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty and evaluate its efficacy for preventing Descemet's membrane folds. METHODS We calculated the arc diameter of the recipient bed by using the cosine formula and developed a table to aid surgeons in donor punch size selection. To test the usefulness of this formula, we evaluated the development of Descemet's membrane folds in keratoconus patients with very steep corneas (K >60 D). In group 1, deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty surgeries were performed using graft sizes that were determined based on our model (n=31). In group 2, graft sizes were determined based on the empirical judgment of the surgeon without any formal calculation (n=30). RESULTS Our theoretical calculations demonstrated that the diameter of donor punch sizes needed to prevent Descemet's membrane fold increases when the cornea is steeper, or the trephine size is larger. We tested the efficacy of this model on the clinical outcome of deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty. The mean age (28.9 ± 10.1 years vs. 32.8 ± 8.3 years, p=0.11) and preoperative K1 (59.2 ± 9.3 D vs. 58.1 ± 9.4 D, p=0.67), K2 (66.2 ± 6.0 D vs. 65.7 ± 7.4 D, p=0.81), and Km values (62.1 ± 7.7 D vs. 61.8 ± 8.1 D, p=0.88) were similar between the two groups. Three patients developed Descemet's membrane folds in group 2, and none of the patients developed Descemet's membrane folds in group 1. These results supported our theo retical calculations. CONCLUSION Adjustment of donor graft size based on the calculated arc diameter of the recipient bed reduced the development of Descemet's membrane folds after deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty in steep corneas.","Genc, Selim; Esen, Fehim; Guler, Emre; Çakir, Hanefi",Arquivos brasileiros de oftalmologia,https://doi.org/10.5935/0004-2749.20200077; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33084812/,134

PATIENTS AND METHODS This study included all epidermal growth factor receptor-mutated (EGFR+, n = 108) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase-rearranged (ALK+, n = 33) TKI-naive NSCLC patients diagnosed with BM in the Thoraxklinik Heidelberg between 2009 and 2019. Eighty-seven patients (62%) received early LT, while 54 (38%) received delayed (n = 34; 24%) or no LT (n = 20; 14%). LT comprised stereotactic (SRT; n = 40; 34%) or whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT; n = 77; 66%), while neurosurgical resection was carried out in 19 cases. RESULTS Median overall survival (OS) was 49.1 months for ALK+ and 19.5 months for EGFR+ patients (P = 0.001), with similar median intracranial progression-free survival (icPFS) (15.7 versus 14.0 months, respectively; P = 0.80). Despite the larger and more symptomatic BM (P < 0.001) of patients undergoing early LT, these experienced longer icPFS [hazard ratio (HR) 0.52; P = 0.024], but not OS (HR 1.63; P = 0.12), regardless of the radiotherapy technique (SRT versus WBRT) and number of lesions. High-risk oncogene variants, i.e. non-del19 EGFR mutations and 'short' EML4-ALK fusions (mainly variant 3, E6:A20), were associated with earlier intracranial progression (HR 2.97; P = 0.001). The longer icPFS with early LT was also evident in separate analyses of the EGFR+ and ALK+ subsets. CONCLUSIONS Despite preferential use for cases with poor prognostic factors, early LT prolongs the icPFS, but not OS, in TKI-treated EGFR+/ALK+ NSCLC. Considering the lack of survival benefit, and the neurocognitive effects of WBRT, patients presenting with polytopic BM may benefit from delaying radiotherapy, or from radiosurgery of multiple or selected lesions. For SRT candidates, the improved tumor control with earlier radiotherapy should be weighed against the potential toxicity and the enhanced intracranial activity of newer TKI. High-risk EGFR/ALK variants are associated with earlier intracranial failure and identify patients who could benefit from more aggressive management.","El Shafie, R A; Seidensaal, K; Bozorgmehr, F; Kazdal, D; Eichkorn, T; Elshiaty, M; Weber, D; Allgäuer, M; König, L; Lang, K; Forster, T; Arians, N; Rieken, S; Heussel, C-P; Herth, F J; Thomas, M; Stenzinger, A; Debus, J; Christopoulos, P",ESMO open,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2021.100161; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34090172/,134

In this study, we used acrolein as a model toxicant and defined the concentration-response relationships of the key adverse responses in normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells and human mucoepidermoid pulmonary carcinoma (NCI-H292) cells. Direct trace analysis of intracellular free acrolein is extremely challenging, if not impossible. Therefore, we developed a new method for indirectly estimating the intracellular uptake of acrolein. A 10-min treatment was employed to capture the rapid occurrence of the key alkylation reactions of acrolein. Responses, including protein carbonylation, GSH depletion, and GSH-acrolein (GSH-ACR) adduct formation, were all linearly correlated with acrolein uptake in both cell types. Compared to the NCI-H292 mucoepidermoid carcinoma cells, NHBE cells were more sensitive to acrolein exposure. Furthermore, results from the time-course studies demonstrated that depletion and conjugation of GSH were the primary adverse events and directly associated with the cytotoxicity induced by acrolein. In summary, these data suggest that cell susceptibility to acrolein exposure is closely associated with acrolein uptake and formation of GSH-ACR adducts. The dosimetric analysis presented in this study may provide useful information for computational modeling and risk assessment of acrolein using different test systems.","Xiong, Rui; Wu, Qiangen; Bryant, Matthew; Rosenfeldt, Hans; Healy, Sheila; Cao, Xuefei",Environmental toxicology and pharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.etap.2020.103576; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33385576/,134

Planetary health is a useful concept for health profession education (HPE) teaching and practice because it situates health within a broader understanding of the interdependent socio-ecological drivers of human and planetary health. It facilitates novel ways of protecting both population health and the natural environment on which human health and well-being depends. This paper focuses on the climate crisis as an example of the relationship between environmental change, healthcare, and education. We analyze how HPE can help decarbonize the healthcare sector to address both climate change and inequity in health outcomes. Based on the healthcare practitioner's mandate of beneficence, we propose simple learning objectives to equip HPE graduates with the knowledge, skills, and values to create a sustainable health system, using carbon emission reductions as an example.

The personal and socioeconomic costs of chronic pain cannot be overstated. Physicians are at the crux of the pandemic and must attempt to limit the spread of the virus while maintaining their professional responsibility to their patients and staff members. OBJECTIVE The aim of this review is to analyze the existing literature to develop consensus recommendations for treating pain during the current COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS Relevant literature was located via computer-generated citations between the months of March and May of 2020. Online computer searches of multiple databases including Google Scholar, CINAHL, PubMed and Cochrane Review were conducted in conjunction with a thorough review of local, state, national, and international governmental and organizational websites to locate research on the area of interest. RESULTS The guidelines in this review are meant to provide a framework for pain practioners and organizations to provide highly effective, ethical, and safe care to patients while maintaining their commitment to mitigating the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Specific areas addressed include general and interventional-specific treatment and mitigation recommendations.

The current standard of care for PD catheter removal is by complete surgical dissection, withdrawing both the tubing and the cuffs. The intention is to avoid infection of any residual part of the catheter. We retrospectively analyzed our results with the alternative 'pull' technique, by which the silicon tube is pulled out, leaving the Dacron cuffs within the abdominal wall. This technique never gained popularity due to concern that the retained cuffs would get infected. ♦ METHODS: We reviewed our experience from an 18-month period, between January 2014 and June 2015. There were 46 catheter removals in 40 patients. All the catheters were of the double-cuffed coiled Tenckhoff type (Covidien, Dublin, Ireland). ♦ RESULTS: Of the 46 catheter removals by the 'pull' technique, there was only 1 case of retained cuff infection. ♦ CONCLUSIONS: The 'pull' technique is a safe method for Tenckhoff catheter removal with low risk of infection.

The study aimed to monitor in-depth the feasibility of the regulations and their impact on the well-being of residents, their visitors, and healthcare staff. DESIGN Mixed-methods study in 5 of the 26 facilities; the facilities were affiliated to an academic network of nursing homes. PARTICIPANTS Visitors and healthcare professionals. INTERVENTION Allowing visitors using local regulations based on national guidelines. MEASUREMENTS Digital questionnaire, analyzing documentation such as infection prevention control protocols, attending meetings of COVID-19 crisis teams, in-depth telephone or in-person interviews with visitors and healthcare professionals, and on-site observations. RESULTS National guidelines were translated with great variety into local care practice. Healthcare professionals agreed that reopening would increase the well-being of the residents and their loved ones. However, there were also great worries for increasing workload, increasing the risk of emotional exhaustion, and the risk of COVID-19 infections. Compliance with local regulations was generally satisfactory, but maintaining social distance and correctly wearing face masks appeared to be difficult. Care staff remained ambivalent for fear of infections. In general, allowing visitors was experienced as having a positive impact on the well-being of all stakeholders. Nevertheless, some residents with dementia showed negative effects. CONCLUSION The complete lockdown of Dutch nursing homes had a substantial impact on the well-being of the residents. The reopening was welcomed by all stakeholders, but provided a high organizational workload as well as feelings of ambivalence among care staff. In the second wave, a more tailored approach is being implemented. However, facilities are sometimes still struggling to find the right balance between infection control and well-being.","Koopmans, Raymond T C M; Verbeek, Hilde; Bielderman, Annemiek; Janssen, Meriam M; Persoon, Anke; Lesman-Leegte, Ivonne; Sizoo, Eefje M; Hamers, Jan P H; Gerritsen, Debby L",International psychogeriatrics,https://doi.org/10.1017/s1041610221000296; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33818339/,134

Current practices surrounding post-operative care involve admission and routine esophagogram prior to discharge. This study aims to establish the safety and feasibility of same-day discharge following POEM. METHODS Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data for patients who underwent POEM between November 2013 and June 2019 at a single institution in Ontario, Canada. Patients were discharged home on the same day with controlled pain, when tolerating clear fluids. Patients were admitted if clinically indicated. Esophagography was initially a systematic practice prior to discharge, but later only performed when clinically indicated. Emergency department visits and hospital admissions within 90 days were assessed. RESULTS In total, 90 patients underwent a successful POEM procedure. A total of 72 patients (79.1%) were discharged on the same day, 14 patients (15.4%) were discharged home the following day, and 5 patients (5.5%) experienced longer admissions to hospital. One POEM was unsuccessful. 22 (24.2%) patients had adverse events, leading to 8 (8.8%) unplanned admissions, with one patient requiring prolonged admission for esophageal leak, identified clinically. Fifty-three patients underwent routine esophagography while part of our protocol, with no identified leak, which prompted our change in practice to only perform esophagography when clinically indicated. In the 90-day post-procedure, ten patients visited the emergency department, of which seven were re-admitted, five for POEM-related issues. Our mean Eckhardt score at 2 weeks was 2.1 from 7.2 preoperatively. CONCLUSION This study establishes that same-day discharge is both safe and feasible following POEM and suggests that esophagography should be performed only when clinically indicated. This represents a shift from the routine practice of admission and imaging for patients undergoing POEM, encouraging the transition to outpatient POEM procedures.","Cloutier, Zacharie; Mann, Aneetinder; Doumouras, Aristithes G; Hong, Dennis",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-020-07781-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32648037/,134

In the first experiment, a single layer of Streptococcus mutans bacteria on agar plates was exposed to UVL-C irradiation at energies from 0 to 21 mWs/cm2. The second experiment was conducted to inhibit viability of bacterial colonies on solid surfaces. The samples were derived from saliva from a patient where bacteria were grown on plastic strips and then exposed to UVL-C. The highest energy was 1050 mWs/cm2. RESULTS Exposure to 21 mWs/cm2 was bactericidal in single layers of Streptococcus mutans. The result for bacterial colonies on solid surfaces indicated only a bacteriostatic effect, even at energies of 1050 mWs/cm2. CONCLUSIONS Ultraviolet light C exhibits bactericidal effects on single layers of Streptococcus mutans but has a limited effect on bacterial colonies in a biofilm.

We decided to include all types of articles, except for case studies, published until the end of February 2021 focusing on the effects of COVID-19 on the respiratory system and the main treatment recommendations up to date for patients with bronchial asthma.Results: Until now there is no clear evidence that asthmatics have a higher risk of experiencing exacerbations when infected, nor higher mortality rates than the general population. Nevertheless, our knowledge on molecular pathways behind asthma phenotypes in the past decades is growing, and it underlines the need to predict the unique response each patient may have to infection from the novel coronavirus. It is not clear yet if certain sub-populations of asthmatics are at higher risk than others.Conclusion: Despite the lack of evidence for higher susceptibility and/or mortality in relation to COVID-19, all asthmatic patients, whether treated with inhaled bronchodilators / corticosteroids or even biologics, should maintain their controller therapy without making any alterations.","Bakakos, Agamemnon; Krompa, Anastasia",The Journal of asthma : official journal of the Association for the Care of Asthma,https://doi.org/10.1080/02770903.2021.1941093; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34112029/,134
147738,Robot-Assisted Simple Prostatectomy by an Extraperitoneal Approach.,2018,"PURPOSE Lowering a load could be associated with abnormal shoulder and scapular motion. We tested the hypothesis that lowering a load involves different shoulder muscle coordination strategies compared to lifting a load. METHODS EMG activity of 13 muscles was recorded in 30 healthy volunteers who lifted and lowered a 6, 12 or 18 kg box between three shelves. Kinematics, EMG levels and muscle synergies, extracted using non-negative matrix factorization, were analyzed. RESULTS We found greater muscle activity level during lowering in four muscles (+ 1-2% MVC in anterior deltoid, biceps brachii, serratus anterior and pectoralis major). The movements were performed faster during lifting (18.2 vs. 15.9 cm/s) but with similar hand paths and segment kinematics. The number of synergies was the same in both tasks. Two synergies were identified in ~ 75% of subjects, and one synergy in the others. Synergy #1 mainly activated prime movers' muscles, while synergy #2 co-activated several antagonist muscles. Synergies' structure was similar between lifting and lowering (Pearson's r ≈ 0.9 for synergy #1 and 0.7-08 for synergy #2). Synergy #2 was more activated during lowering and explained the greater activity observed in anterior deltoid, serratus anterior and pectoralis. CONCLUSION Lifting and lowering a load were associated with similar synergy structure. In 3/4 of subjects, lowering movements involved greater activation of a ""multiple antagonists"" synergy. The other subjects co-contracted all shoulder muscles as a unit in both conditions. These inter-individual differences should be investigated in the occurrence of shoulder musculoskeletal disorders.","Turpin, Nicolas A; Martinez, Romain; Begon, Mickael",European journal of applied physiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00421-020-04464-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32803382/,134
147841,History of colorectal surgery: A comprehensive historical review from the ancient Egyptians to the surgical robot.,2015,"Background The global outbreak of COVID-19 is a significant threat to public health. Among COVID-19 cases, critically ill patients account for most in-hospital deaths. Given the pressing clinical needs, identification of potential prognostic factors that would assist clinicians to determine appropriate therapeutic interventions is urgently needed. Methods A retrospective analysis of 171 critically ill COVID-19 patients from two medical centers in Wuhan was conducted. The training and validation cohorts were comprised of 77 and 94 patients, respectively. Univariate and multivariate Logistic regression analyses were used to identify independent prognostic factors, and the linear prediction index was established and externally validated. Results Blood urine nitrogen (BUN) and high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) were independent factors negatively correlated with patient survival in the training cohort. A linear prediction model, named as the CB index (hs-CRP combined with BUN), was established and logistic regression analysis showed that this was associated with a 13% increase in death rate, with high sensitivity (86.7%) and specificity (89.7%). Patients were then divided into a high-risk group (CB index >32) and low-risk group (CB index <32) and the high-risk group showed a 56.3-fold risk of death compared with the low-risk group. Importantly, these findings were readily recaptured in the validation cohort. The efficacy of the CB index in predicting prognosis in real-world patients was then determined, which showed that patients with a higher CB index had an increased risk of death in comparison to those with a lower CB index. Conclusions The CB index may be an important prognostic factor in critically ill COVID-19 patients.","Cao, Liang; Zhang, Sha; Wang, Enxin; Zhang, Yongchao; Bai, Yang; Luo, Xi; Li, Zhe; Li, Feng; Tao, Ling; Liu, Haitao",Annals of translational medicine,https://doi.org/10.21037/atm-20-7447; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33490166/,134
147842,Practice does not always make perfect: need for selection curricula in modern surgical training.,2017,"Objective Few studies have reported the outcome of mechanical thrombectomy with Solitaire stent retrival (MTSR) in subtypes of acute ischemic stroke. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and result of MTSR in acute cardioembolic stroke. Methods Twenty consecutive patients with acute cardioembolic stroke were treated by MTSR. The angiographic outcome was assessed by thrombolysis in cerebral infarction (TICI) grade. TICI grade 2a, 2b, or 3 with a measurable thrombus that was retrieved was considered as a success when MTSR was performed in the site of primary vessel occlusion, and TICI grade 2b or 3 was considered as a success when final result was reported. Clinical and radiological results were compared between two groups divided on the basis of final results of MTSR. Persistent thrombus compression sign on angiogram was defined as a stenotic, tapered arterial lumen whenever temporary stenting was performed. The clinical outcomes were assessed by the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at 3 months. Results The failure rate of MTSR was 20% (4/20) and other modalities, such as permanent stenting, were needed. Final successful recanalization (TICI grade 2b or 3) was 80% when other treatments were included. The rate of good outcome (mRS≤2) was 35% at the 3-month follow-up. Failure of MTSR was significantly correlated with persistent thrombus compression sign (p=0.001). Conclusion Some cases of cardioembolic stroke are resistant to MTSR and may need other treatment modalities. Careful interpretation of angiogram may be helpful to the decision.","Han, Hokyun; Choi, Hyunho; Cho, Keun-Tae; Kim, Byong-Cheol",Journal of Korean Neurosurgical Society,https://doi.org/10.3340/jkns.2016.0707.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29142621/,134
148316,Single-surgeon experience with robot-assisted ureteroneocystostomy for distal ureteral pathologies in adults.,2013,"A density functional theory (DFT) study of the 1H- and 13C-NMR chemical shifts of the geometric isomers of 18:2 ω-7 conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) and nine model compounds is presented, using five functionals and two basis sets. The results are compared with available experimental data from solution high resolution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The experimental 1H chemical shifts exhibit highly diagnostic resonances due to the olefinic protons of the conjugated double bonds. The ""inside"" olefinic protons of the conjugated double bonds are deshielded than those of the ""outside"" protons. Furthermore, in the cis/trans isomers, the signals of the cis bonds are more deshielded than those of the trans bonds. These regularities of the experimental 1H chemical shifts of the olefinic protons of the conjugated double bonds are reproduced very accurately for the lowest energy DFT optimized single conformer, for all functionals and basis sets used. The other low energy conformers have negligible effects on the computational 1H-NMR chemical shifts. We conclude that proton NMR chemical shifts are more discriminating than carbon, and DFT calculations can provide a valuable tool for (i) the accurate prediction of 1H-NMR chemical shifts even with less demanding functionals and basis sets; (ii) the unequivocal identification of geometric isomerism of CLAs that occur in nature, and (iii) to derive high resolution structures in solution.","Venianakis, Themistoklis; Oikonomaki, Christina; Siskos, Michael G; Varras, Panayiotis C; Primikyri, Alexandra; Alexandri, Eleni; Gerothanassis, Ioannis P",Molecules,https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules25163660; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32796664/,134
148499,Abdominal wall regenerative medicine for a large defect using tissue engineering: an experimental study.,2016,"Luteolin is a widely distributed flavone herbs and vegetables. It has anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory activities and improves glucose metabolism by potentiating insulin sensitivity and improving β-cell function and mass. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is induced by the deposition of amyloid-beta (Aβ) in the hippocampus and the formation of neurotoxic Aβ plaques. The Aβ deposition is associated with increased formation of Aβ from amyloid precursor protein by up-regulation of β-secretase and β-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1). Furthermore, Aβ accumulation is increased by brain insulin resistance. The impairment of insulin/IGF-1 signaling mainly in the hippocampus and brain insulin resistance is connected to signals originating in the liver and gut microbiota, known as the gut microbiota-liver-brain axis. This indicates that the changes in the production of short-chain fatty acids by the gut microbiota and pro-inflammatory cytokines can alter insulin resistance in the liver and brain. Luteolin is detected in the brain tissues after passing through the blood-brain barrier, where it can directly influence neuroinflammation and brain insulin resistance and modulate Aβ deposition. Luteolin (10-70 mg/kg bw for rodents) can modulate the systemic and brain insulin resistance, and it suppresses AD development directly, and it influences Aβ deposition by activation of the gut microbiota-liver-brain axis. In this review, we evaluate the potential of luteolin to mitigate two potential causes of AD, neuroinflammatory processes, and disruption of glucose metabolism in the brain. This review suggests that luteolin intake can enhance brain insulin resistance and neuroinflammation, directly and indirectly, to protect against the development of Alzheimer's-like disease, and the gut microbiota-liver-brain axis is mainly involved in the indirect pathway. However, most studies have been conducted in animal studies, and human clinical trials are needed.","Daily, James W; Kang, Suna; Park, Sunmin",BioFactors,https://doi.org/10.1002/biof.1703; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33347668/,134

Resident physicians appear to be more exposed due to the higher workload, prolonged exposure and the first contact with patients. To compare the incidence of burnout syndrome before and during the COVID 19 pandemic in cardiology residents. A prospective study was carried out. The Maslach questionnaire was implemented in cardiology residents of an institution of the City of Buenos Aires, in the month of September 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic and the results were compared with those prospectively collected in the same population during September of 2019. The survey was anonymous. The questionnaire was responded by 39 residents (2019: 16; 2020: 23). Burnout was observed in 30% (n = 7) in 2019, and in 39% (9%) residents during the COVID-19 pandemic (P= 0.77). The median score for emotional exhaustion was 38 (IQR 29-43) for the 2020s group, and 34 (IQR 27-42) for the 2019 (P = 0.32). The median score for depersonalization was 12 (IQR 5-19) and 15 (IQR 11-18) for 2020 and 2019 respectively (P = 0.50). The median score for personal accomplishment in the 2020s group was 30 (IQR 23-37) and 31 (IQR 26-35) in the 2019s (P = 0.28). The COVID-19 pandemic was not associated with an increase in the incidence of burnout in cardiology residents, who already report a significant prevalence of this syndrome in pre pandemic period. We emphasize the importance of creating prevention strategies aimed at improving resident's working conditions and quality of life, especially in periods of high stress and workload such as a global health emergency.","Baro Vila, Rocio C; Burgos, Lucrecia M; Sigal, Alan; Costabel, Juan Pablo; Alves de Lima, Alberto",Current problems in cardiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpcardiol.2021.100873; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34108084/,134

149750,Single-port access total laparoscopic hysterectomy for large uterus.,2013,"This article reviews the discovery of PCSK9, its structure-function characteristics, and its presently known and proposed novel biological functions. The major critical function of PCSK9 deduced from human and mouse studies, as well as cellular and structural analyses, is its role in increasing the levels of circulating LDL-cholesterol (LDLc), via its ability to enhance the sorting and escort of the cell surface LDL receptor (LDLR) to lysosomes. This implicates the binding of the catalytic domain of PCSK9 to the EGF-A domain of the LDLR. This also requires the presence of the C-terminal Cys/His-rich domain (CHRD), its binding to the secreted cytosolic cyclase associated protein 1 (CAP-1), and possibly another membrane-bound ""protein X"". Curiously, in PCSK9-deficient mice, an alternative to the downregulation of the surface levels of the LDLR by PCSK9 is taking place in the liver of female mice in a 17β-estradiol-dependent manner by still an unknown mechanism. Recent studies have extended our understanding of the biological functions of PCSK9, namely its implication in septic shock, vascular inflammation, viral infections (Dengue; SARS-CoV-2) or immune checkpoint modulation in cancer via the regulation of the cell surface levels of the T-cell receptor and MHC-I, which govern the anti-tumoral activity of CD8 + T cells. Because PCSK9 inhibition may be advantageous in these processes, the availability of injectable safe PCSK9 inhibitors (PCSK9i) that reduces by 50-60% LDLc above the effect of statins is highly valuable. Indeed, injectable PCSK9 mAb or siRNA could be added to current immunotherapies in cancer/metastasis.","Seidah, Nabil G; Prat, Annik",Endocrine reviews,https://doi.org/10.1210/endrev/bnab035; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34626468/,134

The purpose of this study was to discover research that can contribute to understanding decentralisation as one strategy for resolving challenges in healthcare service delivery organisations. This scoping review provides examples and research-informed guidance for decentralisation research, planning and implementation. FINDINGS There is limited empirical research into management decentralisation within primary and community care, but some useful frameworks for assessing and planning decentralisation. Rapid changes are being made to workforce redesign, substitution and patient co-production. Research into such 'micro-decentralisation' is not considered in the decentralisation literature. Neither is how the context of culture, systems and regulations affects implementation of this type of decentralisation. Our recent experience suggests that management decentralisation can enable fast and effective local changes to respond to the evolving Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS COV-2) pandemic. CONCLUSIONS Decentralisation can create conditions that support innovation and improvement locally to develop primary and community care. Managers and policy makers can use an appropriate decentralisation strategy to address challenges in workforce retention and recruitment, rising care demands and expectations of patients. There are opportunities for researchers to provide actionable knowledge about changes in organisations and management which could address current challenges in healthcare.","Ohrling, Mikael; Øvretveit, John; Brommels, Mats",The International journal of health planning and management,https://doi.org/10.1002/hpm.3058; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32862493/,134

We want to confirm the potential mechanisms, including reduced phosphorylation of AKT/MAPK pathways, as well as enhanced CD8+ T-cell-mediated antitumor immune response. To clarify the mechanism of propranolol activity in colorectal cancer, the therapeutic activity of propranolol was then assessed in CT26WT tumors engrafted in BALB/C mice. Then the effect of propranolol treatment was also examined by randomizing patients undergoing surgical resection of a previously untreated colorectal cancer to propranolol or placebo group and treated for 1 week prior to surgery. CT26WT tumor size was smaller after propranolol than vehicle control. Propranolol downregulated the expression of p-AKT/p-ERK/p-MEK in tumor tissue. The frequency of tumor CD8+ T cells was significantly elevated in propranolol-treated mice. The expression of GzmB/IFN-γ/T-bet in the CD8+ T-cell population was significantly increased in propranolol treated mice tumor tissue. In propranolol-treated surgical specimens, the expression of p-ERK was decreased and the frequency of CD8+ was significantly elevated. The expression of GzmB in the CD8+ T-cell population was significantly increased in propranolol-treated subjects. Together these data show propranolol simultaneously activating autologous CD8+ T cells and decreasing the expression of p-AKT/p-ERK/p-MEK in mouse tumor models, while inhibiting the expression of p-ERK in clinical colorectal cancer.

The staggering mortality rates among African Americans, Native Americans, and Latinx Americans during the COVID-19 pandemic have revealed how recalcitrant structural inequities can exacerbate disparities and render not just individuals but whole communities acutely vulnerable. While medical curricula that educate students about disparities are vital in rousing awareness, it is experience that is most likely to instill passion for change. The authors first consider the roots of health care disparities in relation to the current pandemic. Then they examine the importance of salient learning experiences that may inspire a commitment to championing social justice. Experiences in diverse communities can imbue medical students with a desire for lifelong learning and advocacy. The authors introduce a three-pillar framework that consists of trust building, structural competency, and cultural humility. They discuss how these pillars should underpin educational efforts to improve social determinants of health. Effecting systemic change requires passion and resolve; therefore, perseverance in such efforts is predicated on learners caring about the structural inequities in housing, education, economic stability, and neighborhoods-all of which influence the health of individuals and communities.","Prince, Andrew D P; Green, Alexander R; Brown, David J; Thompson, Dana M; Neblett, Enrique W; Nathan, Cherie-Ann; Carethers, John M; Gee, Rebekah E; Gruppen, Larry D; Mangrulkar, Rajesh S; Brenner, Michael J",Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,https://doi.org/10.1097/acm.0000000000004139; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33913439/,134

Whether direct MT is equally effective as bridging thrombolysis (intravenous thrombolysis plus MT) in intravenous thrombolysis eligible patients remains unclear. METHODS We compared clinical and radiological outcomes at 3 months in 249 bridging patients with 111 patients receiving direct MT for large-vessel occlusion anterior circulation stroke from 2 prospective registries (study period Essen: June 2012 to August 2013, Bern February 2009 to August 2014). We matched all patients from the direct MT group who would have qualified for intravenous thrombolysis with controls from the bridging group, using multivariate and propensity score methods. Subgroup analyses for internal carotid artery occlusions were performed. RESULTS Baseline characteristics did not differ between the direct MT group and bridging cohort, except for higher rates of coronary heart disease (P=0.029) and shorter intervals from onset to endovascular therapy (P<0.001) in the MT group. Functional outcome, mortality, and intracerebral hemorrhage did not differ, neither in univariate nor after multivariate and propensity score matching. However, in patients with internal carotid artery occlusion, mortality in the direct cohort was significantly lower. CONCLUSIONS In this matched-pair analysis, there was no difference in outcome in patients with large-vessel occlusion anterior circulation stroke treated with direct MT compared with those treated with bridging thrombolysis; however, mortality in patients with internal carotid artery occlusion treated with direct MT was significantly lower than after bridging thrombolysis.

METHODS AND RESULTS Sixty-five dentate AL residents were included in this secondary analysis. CNAs were asked to rate the AL residents' overall oral self-care function using a 6-point Likert scale. Their assessments were then compared with the objective, performance-based Dental Activities Test and the oral hygiene and gingival health measures. The analysis showed that nearly 90% of the participants presented with at least one untreated decayed or broken tooth. On average, nearly two-thirds of the surfaces were covered by soft deposits (Debris Index = 1.83, SD = 0.60). Generalized mild to moderate inflammation (Gingival Index = 1.51, SD = 0.53) commonly presented on residents' gingiva. CNAs were able to accurately identify the residents with substantial impairment in oral self-care function, yet they tended to overestimate the oral self-care function of residents with mild to moderate impairment. CNAs assessments were also not significantly correlated with residents' oral hygiene measures. CONCLUSION CNAs failed to identify and provide assistance to AL residents with impaired oral self-care function, contributing to poor oral oral hygiene in these vulnerable individuals.","Chen, Xi; D'Souza, Violet; Comnick, Carissa L; Xie, Xianjin","Special care in dentistry : official publication of the American Association of Hospital Dentists, the Academy of Dentistry for the Handicapped, and the American Society for Geriatric Dentistry",https://doi.org/10.1111/scd.12521; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32991747/,134

Controlled trials in adults (≥18 years) with autoimmune thyroiditis, comparing selenium with or without levothyroxine substitution, versus placebo and/or levothyroxine substitution, were eligible for inclusion. Identified outcomes were serum thyrotropin (thyroid stimulating hormone) levels in LT4-untreated patients, thyroid ultrasound and health-related quality of life. Eleven publications, covering nine controlled trials, were included in the systematic review. Random effects model meta-analyses were performed in weighted mean difference for thyroid stimulating hormone, ultrasound and health-related quality of life. Quality of evidence was assessed per outcome, using GRADE. Meta-analyses showed no change in thyroid stimulating hormone, or improvements in health-related quality of life or thyroid echogenicity (ultrasound), between levothyroxine substitution-untreated patients assigned to selenium supplementation or placebo. Three trials found some improvement in wellbeing in patients receiving levothyroxine substitution, but could not be synthesized in a meta-analysis. The quality of evidence ranged from very low to low for thyroid stimulating hormone as well as ultrasound outcomes, and low to moderate for health-related quality of life, and was generally downgraded due to small sample sizes. We found no effect of selenium supplementation on thyroid stimulating hormone, health-related quality of life or thyroid ultrasound, in levothyroxine substitution-untreated individuals, and sporadic evaluation of clinically relevant outcomes in levothyroxine substitution-treated patients. Future well-powered RCTs, evaluating e.g. disease progression or health-related quality of life, are warranted before determining the relevance of selenium supplementation in autoimmune thyroiditis.","Winther, Kristian Hillert; Wichman, Johanna Eva Märta; Bonnema, Steen Joop; Hegedüs, Laszlo",Endocrine,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12020-016-1098-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27683225/,134
151719,Laparoscopic partial nephrectomy.,2016,"To help inform global guidelines on infant feeding, this systematic review synthesizes evidence related to the presence of the Ebola virus (EBOV) in breast milk and its potential risk of viral transmission to the infant when breastfeeding. We relied on a comprehensive search strategy to identify studies including women with suspected, probable, or confirmed EBOV infection, intending to breastfeed or give breast milk to an infant. Our search identified 10,454 records, and after deduplication and screening, we assessed 148 full texts. We included eight studies reporting on 10 breastfeeding mothers and their children (one mother with twins), who provided breast milk samples for assessment. EBOV was detected via RT-PCR or viral culture in seven out of ten breast milk samples. Four out of the five-breastfed infants with EBOV-positive breast milk were found positive for EBOV infection, and all of these EBOV-positive infants died. Since previous reports have detected EBOV in tears, saliva, sweat, and contaminated surfaces, with the current evidence, it is not possible to conclude with certainty that breast milk was the main route of EBOV transmission.","Medina-Rivera, Melisa; Centeno-Tablante, Elizabeth; Finkelstein, Julia L; Rayco-Solon, Pura; Peña-Rosas, Juan Pablo; Garcia-Casal, Maria N; Rogers, Lisa; Ridwan, Pratiwi; Martinez, Sabrina Sales; Andrade, Joyce; Layden, Alexander J; Chang, Juan; Zambrano, Mildred P; Ghezzi-Kopel, Kate; Mehta, Saurabh",Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,https://doi.org/10.1111/nyas.14519; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33113592/,134
152028,Robotic and laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy: a hybrid approach.,2010,"OBJECTIVE To assess whether the association between reperfusion and improved clinical outcomes after stroke differs depending on the site of the arterial occlusive lesion (AOL). METHODS We pooled data from Solitaire With the Intention for Thrombectomy (SWIFT), Solitaire FR Thrombectomy for Acute Revascularisation (STAR), Diffusion and Perfusion Imaging Evaluation for Understanding Stroke Evolution Study 2 (DEFUSE 2), and Interventional Management of Stroke Trial (IMS III) to compare the strength of the associations between reperfusion and clinical outcomes in patients with internal carotid artery (ICA), proximal middle cerebral artery (MCA) (M1), and distal MCA (M2/3/4) occlusions. RESULTS Among 710 included patients, the site of the AOL was the ICA in 161, the proximal MCA in 389, and the distal MCA in 160 patients (M2 = 131, M3 = 23, and M4 = 6). Reperfusion was associated with an increase in the rate of good functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] score 0-2) in patients with ICA (odds ratio [OR] 3.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.7-7.2) and proximal MCA occlusions (OR 6.2, 95% CI 3.8-10.2), but not in patients with distal MCA occlusions (OR 1.4, 95% CI 0.8-2.6). Among patients with M2 occlusions, a subset of the distal MCA cohort, reperfusion was associated with excellent functional outcome (mRS 0-1; OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.0-4.7). CONCLUSIONS The association between endovascular reperfusion and better clinical outcomes is more profound in patients with ICA and proximal MCA occlusions compared to patients with distal MCA occlusions. Because there are limited data from randomized controlled trials on the effect of endovascular therapy in patients with distal MCA occlusions, these results underscore the need for inclusion of this subgroup in future endovascular therapy trials.","Lemmens, Robin; Hamilton, Scott A; Liebeskind, David S; Tomsick, Tom A; Demchuk, Andrew M; Nogueira, Raul G; Marks, Michael P; Jahan, Reza; Gralla, Jan; Yoo, Albert J; Yeatts, Sharon D; Palesch, Yuko Y; Saver, Jeffrey L; Pereira, Vitor M; Broderick, Joseph P; Albers, Gregory W; Lansberg, Maarten G",Neurology,https://doi.org/10.1212/wnl.0000000000002399; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26802090/,134

The need to provide clinical care, while minimising patient interaction, has led to wider adoption of both telephone and online consultations, with the potential complications and pitfalls that accompany such a change in practice. A literature search was performed using the Pubmed, MEDLINE and Embase databases, from database inception up to 25 January 2021.

152286,Robotic infant surgery with 3 mm instruments: a study in piglets of less than 10 kg body weight.,2021-03-26,"An unusual case of central venous catheter (CVC)-related thrombosis during supine surgery in the prone position is presented. A 76-year-old woman was scheduled for elective surgery to repair a broken lumbar instrument. A single-lumen CVC was inserted via the right internal jugular vein. Surgery was performed in the prone position, with the patient's face directed downward in the standard median position (i.e., no rotation), but with slight forward flexion at the neck. After the surgery, the external jugular vein was dilated, and a postoperative X-ray revealed an infiltrative shadow in the right thoracic cavity. Because cervical echography showed dilated cervical veins with a ""moyamoya-type"" echo, possibly indicating a thrombus, contrast-enhanced computed tomography was performed, revealing a venous thrombus in the right internal jugular vein. An internal jugular venous-velocity measurement suggested that her slightly flexed neck position and her prone position during surgery may have kinked the internal jugular vein, causing engorgement with venous blood. The presence of the internal jugular venous catheter may have created thrombogenic conditions. A patient's position during surgery can reduce deep venous-flow velocity, and venous blood may stagnate, contributing greatly to thrombogenicity. We should consider a patient's position during surgery as a risk factor for thrombus formation, and a careful preoperative evaluation should be made as to which route should be chosen for CVC.","Minami, Kimito; Iida, Miki; Iida, Hiroki",Journal of anesthesia,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00540-012-1329-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22318554/,134

152757,Successful laparoscopic surgery of accessory cavitated uterine mass in young women with severe dysmenorrhea.,2020-09-18,"We describe a mammalian cell-based assay to identify coronavirus 3CL protease (3CLpro) inhibitors. This assay is based on rescuing protease-mediated cytotoxicity and does not require live virus. By enabling the facile testing of compounds across a range of 15 distantly related coronavirus 3CLpro enzymes, we identify compounds with broad 3CLpro inhibitory activity. We also adapt the assay for use in compound screening and in doing so uncover additional SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro inhibitors. We observe strong concordance between data emerging from this assay and those obtained from live virus testing. The reported approach democratizes the testing of 3CLpro inhibitors by developing a simplified method for identifying coronavirus 3CLpro inhibitors that can be used by the majority of laboratories, rather than the few with extensive biosafety infrastructure. We identify two lead compounds, GC376 and compound 4, with broad activity against all 3CL proteases tested including 3CLpro enzymes from understudied zoonotic coronaviruses.ImportanceMultiple coronavirus pandemics have occurred over the last two decades. This has highlighted a need to be proactive in the development of therapeutics that can be readily deployed in the case of future coronavirus pandemics. We develop and validate a simplified cell-based assay for the identification of chemical inhibitors of 3CL proteases encoded by a wide range of coronaviruses. This assay is reporter-free, does not require specialized biocontainment, and is optimized for performance in high-throughput screening. By testing reported 3CL protease inhibitors against a large collection of 3CL proteases with variable sequence similarity, we identify compounds with broad activity against 3CL proteases and uncover structural insights that contribute to their broad activity. Furthermore, we demonstrate this assay is suitable for identifying chemical inhibitors of proteases from families other than 3CL proteases.","Resnick, Samuel J; Iketani, Sho; Hong, Seo Jung; Zask, Arie; Liu, Hengrui; Kim, Sungsoo; Melore, Schuyler; Lin, Fang-Yu; Nair, Manoj S; Huang, Yaoxing; Lee, Sumin; Tay, Nicholas E S; Rovis, Tomislav; Yang, Hee Won; Xing, Li; Stockwell, Brent R; Ho, David D; Chavez, Alejandro",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02374-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33910954/,134

The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of primary closure in patients with previous biliary surgery history compared to T-tube drainage. Eighty patients with previous biliary surgery history including laparoscopic cholecystectomy, open cholecystectomy, or open common bile duct exploration were enrolled in the retrospective study. The patients were divided into 2 groups according to the methods of choledochotomy closure. Group A: patients with primary closure after LCBDE (n = 51); group B: patients with T-tube drainage after LCBDE (n = 29). Group A exhibited a shorter postoperative hospital stay and lower hospitalization expenses compared to group B. There was no significant difference in conversion rate to open surgery, operating time, intraoperative blood loss, bile leakage rate, overall complication rate, and stone recurrence rate between the 2 groups. Biliary stricture was not observed in the 2 groups during the follow-up period. Primary closure following LCBDE is safe and effective for the management of CBD stones in patients with previous biliary surgery history.","Zhen, Wan; Xu-Zhen, Wang; Nan-Tao, Fu; Yong, Li; Wei-Dong, Xiao; Dong-Hui, Zheng",The American surgeon,https://doi.org/10.1177/0003134820947396; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32911967/,134

Increasing antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major public health threat, resulting in multiple campaigns across countries to improve appropriate antimicrobial use. This includes addressing the overuse of antimicrobials for self-limiting infections, such as upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs), particularly in lower- and middle-income countries (LMICs) where there is the greatest inappropriate use and where antibiotic utilisation has increased the most in recent years. Consequently, there is a need to document current practices and successful initiatives in LMICs to improve future antimicrobial use.Methodology: Documentation of current epidemiology and management of URTIs, particularly in LMICs, as well as campaigns to improve future antimicrobial use.Results: There is still considerable concern regarding the prescribing and dispensing of antibiotics for URTIs among LMICs. This includes considerable self-purchasing, up to 100% of pharmacies in some LMICs. However, multiple activities are now ongoing to improve future use. These incorporate educational initiatives among all key stakeholder groups, as well as legislation and other activities to reduce self-purchasing, as part of National Action Plans (NAPs). Further activities are still needed though. These include increased physician and pharmacist education, starting in medical and pharmacy schools; greater monitoring of prescribing and dispensing practices, including the development of pertinent quality indicators; and targeted patient information and health education campaigns. It is recognised that such activities are more challenging in LMICs given more limited resources and a lack of healthcare professionals.Conclusion: Initiatives will grow across LMICs to reduce inappropriate prescribing and dispensing of antimicrobials for URTIs as part of NAPs and other activities, and these will be monitored.","Godman, Brian; Haque, Mainul; McKimm, Judy; Abu Bakar, Muhamad; Sneddon, Jacqueline; Wale, Janney; Campbell, Stephen; Martin, Antony P; Hoxha, Iris; Abilova, Vafa; Anand Paramadhas, Bene D; Mpinda-Joseph, Pinkie; Matome, Matshediso; Lemos, Livia Lovato Pires de; Sefah, Israel; Kurdi, Amanj; Opanga, Sylvia; Jakupi, Arianit; Saleem, Zikria; Hassali, Mohamed Azmi; Kibuule, Dan; Fadare, Joseph; Bochenek, Tomasz; Rothe, Celia; Furst, Jurij; Markovic-Pekovic, Vanda; Bojanić, Ljubica; Schellack, Natalie; Meyer, Johanna C; Matsebula, Zinhle; Phuong, Thuy Nguyen Thi; Thanh, Binh Nguyen; Jan, Saira; Kalungia, Aubrey; Mtapuri-Zinyowera, Sekesai; Sartelli, Massimo; Hill, Ruaraidh",Current medical research and opinion,https://doi.org/10.1080/03007995.2019.1700947; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31794332/,134

We report a novel pooled screening approach for a wider range of cellular and subtle subcellular phenotypes. Machine learning and convolutional neural network models are trained on the subcellular phenotype to be queried. Genome-wide screening then utilizes cells stably expressing dCas9-KRAB (CRISPRi), photoactivatable fluorescent protein (PA-mCherry), and a lentiviral guide RNA (gRNA) pool. Cells are screened by using microscopy and classified by artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, which precisely identify the genetically altered phenotype. Cells with the phenotype of interest are photoactivated and isolated via flow cytometry, and the gRNAs are identified by sequencing. A proof-of-concept screen accurately identified PINK1 as essential for Parkin recruitment to mitochondria. A genome-wide screen identified factors mediating TFEB relocation from the nucleus to the cytosol upon prolonged starvation. Twenty-one of the 64 hits called by the neural network model were independently validated, revealing new effectors of TFEB subcellular localization. This approach, AI-photoswitchable screening (AI-PS), offers a novel screening platform capable of classifying a broad range of mammalian subcellular morphologies, an approach largely unattainable with current methodologies at genome-wide scale.","Kanfer, Gil; Sarraf, Shireen A; Maman, Yaakov; Baldwin, Heather; Dominguez-Martin, Eunice; Johnson, Kory R; Ward, Michael E; Kampmann, Martin; Lippincott-Schwartz, Jennifer; Youle, Richard J",The Journal of cell biology,https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.202006180; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33464298/,134

Material and Methods This is a prospective, interventional, comparative, double-blind randomized control study which was done at a tertiary care center to compare outcomes of conventional and carved conchal cartilage (vertical strut) type III Tympanoplasty in terms of graft uptake and hearing gain. A total number of 52 cases were enrolled, randomized and allocated to 2 groups (26 each) i.e. group A (conventional type III) and group B (vertical strut technique). Results Graft uptake was seen in 25 (96.16%) patients in group B while it was observed in 23 (88.5%) cases in group A. Hearing gains were also better in group B. Conclusion This study suggests that Vertical Strut technique can be studied further as it gives better gains in Air Conduction threshold and A-B Gap along with graft uptake as it provides better middle ear space and ossicular / tympanic membrane interface resulting in better hearing.","Saini, Yogendra Kumar; Singhal, Pawan; Prabhu, K P Surendra; Nagaraj, Sushmitha; Amreen,; Sharma, Shivam; Yadav, Rajeev; Aeron, Bhawani Singh; Munjal, Sudeep; Sharma, Man Prakash",Indian journal of otolaryngology and head and neck surgery : official publication of the Association of Otolaryngologists of India,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12070-021-02614-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34471627/,134

Aims We aimed to study clinical characteristics associated with DWI-FLAIR mismatch in patients with unknown onset stroke. Methods We analyzed baseline MRI and clinical data from patients with acute ischemic stroke proven by DWI from WAKE-UP, an investigator-initiated, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of MRI-based thrombolysis in stroke patients with unknown time of symptom onset. Clinical characteristics were compared between patients with and without DWI-FLAIR mismatch. Results Of 699 patients included, 418 (59.8%) presented with DWI-FLAIR mismatch. A shorter delay between last seen well and symptom recognition (p = 0.0063), a shorter delay between symptom recognition and arrival at hospital (p = 0.0025), and history of atrial fibrillation (p = 0.19) were predictors of DWI-FLAIR mismatch in multivariate analysis. All other characteristics were comparable between groups. Conclusions There are only minor differences in measured clinical characteristics between unknown symptom onset stroke patients with and without DWI-FLAIR mismatch. DWI-FLAIR mismatch as an indicator of stroke onset within 4.5 h shows no relevant association with commonly collected clinical characteristics of stroke patients.

However, the mechanisms governing improvement in glucose homeostasis have yet to be fully elucidated. In this review we discuss the various types of surgical interventions and the multitude of factors that potentially mediate the effects on glycemia, such as altered delivery of nutrients to the distal ileum, duodenal exclusion, gut hormone changes, bile acid reabsorption, and amino acid metabolism. Accumulating evidence that some of these changes seem to be independent of weight loss questions the rationale of using body mass index as the major indication for surgery in diabetic patients. Understanding the complex mechanisms and interactions underlying improved glycemic control could lead to novel therapeutic targets and would also allow for greater individualization of therapy and optimization of surgical outcomes.","Nguyen, Kim T; Korner, Judith",Current diabetes reports,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11892-014-0481-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24705810/,134

The objective of this project was to evaluate the effect of a self-assembled skin substitute (SASS) made by tissue engineering as a temporary cutaneous dressing in the treatment of hard-to-heal chronic ulcers. PATIENTS AND METHODS The prospective uncontrolled case study includes patients suffering from venous or mixed ulcers lasting more than 6 months and unresponsive to compression therapy, with an Ankle Brachial Index greater than 0.5. Compression therapy was combined with the weekly application of SASS, produced from the patient's own skin cells, until healing. A weekly follow-up recorded wound size, skin aspect, pain, drainage, and percentage of wound healing. Photographs were also taken to assess ulcer evolution. RESULTS Fourteen ulcers present on 5 patients were treated. A mean of 6.7 SASS depositions by ulcer was required for healing. Two ulcers developed a minor wound infection, which was treated with oral antibiotics; another 2 ulcers recurred, and 1 healed with a second course of treatment, whereas 1 ulcer had a small recurrence treated with local wound care. CONCLUSION The authors' study suggests that the SASS used as a biological dressing is a promising treatment for hard-to-heal chronic venous and mixed ulcers that are unresponsive to compression therapy.","Boa, Olivier; Cloutier, Chanel Beaudoin; Genest, Hervé; Labbé, Raymond; Rodrigue, Bertrand; Soucy, Jacques; Roy, Michel; Arsenault, Frédéric; Ospina, Carlos E; Dubé, Nathalie; Rochon, Marie-Hélène; Larouche, Danielle; Moulin, Véronique J; Germain, Lucie; Auger, François A",Advances in skin & wound care,https://doi.org/10.1097/01.asw.0000433102.48268.2a; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23958872/,134
154987,SAGES TAVAC safety and efficacy analysis confocal laser endomicroscopy.,2020-05-13,"Topiramate, an antiepileptic drug, has been found to be useful for the treatment of aggression in clinical populations as well as in animal models of aggression. However, increases in aggression were also observed under lower doses of Topiramate. Subsequently, Topiramate produced an inverted U-shaped dose response curve, with increases in aggression at low doses, whereas higher doses engendered anti-aggressive effects. In our previous study, we demonstrated that Topiramate modulates brain activity in the prefrontal areas involved in the modulation of the subcortical circuit mediating aggression, and we found indirect evidence that the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) could be a key site where Topiramate may exert its dose-response effects on aggression. In this study, we performed site-directed injections of Topiramate (0.1 and 0.3 mM) into the ACC on offensive behaviors in isolation-inducedaggression paradigm. By using the resident-intruder test, we demonstrated that Topiramate microinfusion into the ACC at low doses produced increases in aggression, as evidenced by shorter attack latencies (p < 0.01) and increased attack duration (p < 0.01), without affecting the social behavior. In contrast, higher doses engendered anti-aggressive effects, by increasing the attack latencies (p < 0.001), decreasing attack number (p < 0.001) and decreasing attack duration (p < 0.001), as well as an increase in the social behavior. Our findings supported that Topiramate at higher concentrations appeared more efficient to decrease aggression in treated mice.

However, research into PPR is hampered by a lack of standardized measurement. Three studies were undertaken to develop and evaluate an optimized self-report PPR measure. In Study 1, n = 2,334 respondents completed 246 candidate items derived from 19 PPR measures. Exploratory factor analyses identified two underlying dimensions, Responsiveness and Insensitivity. Item response theory was used to develop two 8-item subscales for the Perceived Responsiveness and Insensitivity scale (PRI), both of which showed incremental prediction over global satisfaction. In Study 2, n = 173 respondents completed the brief PRI along with measures of global relationship evaluations and concrete relationship behaviors every other week for 8 weeks. Random intercept cross-lagged panel models found the PRI subscales were more sensitive than global evaluations to fluctuations in support and conflict. In Study 3, n = 161 heterosexual couples completed the brief PRI along with self-reports of responsive and insensitive behaviors. Actor-partner interdependence models demonstrated the PRI subscales were associated with partners' self-reported behaviors even after controlling for own behaviors. Thus, the PRI offers a PPR measure that demonstrates desirable properties for treatment research including (a) incremental validity over global satisfaction, (b) ability to detect meaningful change over time, and (c) sensitivity to partners' behaviors in the relationship.

155630,East Meets West-A Novel Steerable Grasper to Facilitate Gastric Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD): Randomized Comparative Study in a Porcine Model.,2015,"BACKGROUND Hemorrhage is a major cause of early mortality following a traumatic injury. The progression and consequences of significant blood loss occur quickly as death from hemorrhagic shock or exsanguination often occurs within the first few hours. The mainstay of treatment therefore involves early identification of patients at risk for hemorrhagic shock in order to provide blood products and control of the bleeding source if necessary. The intended scope of this review is to identify and assess combinations of predictors informing therapeutic decision-making for clinicians during the initial trauma assessment. The primary objective of this systematic review is to identify and critically assess any existing multivariable models predicting significant traumatic hemorrhage that requires intervention, defined as a composite outcome comprising massive transfusion, surgery for hemostasis, or angiography with embolization for the purpose of external validation or updating in other study populations. If no suitable existing multivariable models are identified, the secondary objective is to identify candidate predictors to inform the development of a new prediction rule. METHODS We will search the EMBASE and MEDLINE databases for all randomized controlled trials and prospective and retrospective cohort studies developing or validating predictors of intervention for traumatic hemorrhage in adult patients 16 years of age or older. Eligible predictors must be available to the clinician during the first hour of trauma resuscitation and may be clinical, lab-based, or imaging-based. Outcomes of interest include the need for surgical intervention, angiographic embolization, or massive transfusion within the first 24 h. Data extraction will be performed independently by two reviewers. Items for extraction will be based on the CHARMS checklist. We will evaluate any existing models for relevance, quality, and the potential for external validation and updating in other populations. Relevance will be described in terms of appropriateness of outcomes and predictors. Quality criteria will include variable selection strategies, adequacy of sample size, handling of missing data, validation techniques, and measures of model performance. DISCUSSION This systematic review will describe the availability of multivariable prediction models and summarize evidence regarding predictors that can be used to identify the need for intervention in patients with traumatic hemorrhage.

155715,Management of postoperative complications during laparoscopic anterior rectal resection.,2021-05-04,"Objectives Serological assays for detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are increasingly used during the COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-Coronavirus-2. Here we evaluated the analytical and clinical performance of three commercially available SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays. Methods A total of 186 samples from 58 patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 infection were measured using SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays by Siemens Healthineers, Roche Diagnostics and Euroimmun. Additionally, 123 control samples, including samples collected before December 2019 and samples with potential cross-reactive antibodies were analyzed. Diagnostic specificity, sensitivity, agreement between assays and ROC curve-derived optimized thresholds were determined. Furthermore, intra- and inter-assay precision and the potential impact of interfering substances were investigated. Results SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays by Siemens and Roche showed 100% specificity. The Euroimmun assay had 98 and 100% specificity, when borderline results are considered as positive or negative, respectively. Diagnostic sensitivity for samples collected ≥14 days after PCR-positivity was 97.0, 89.4 and 95.5% using the Siemens, Roche and Euroimmun assay, respectively. Sensitivity of the Roche assay can be increased using an optimized cut-off index (0.095). However, a simultaneous decrease in specificity (98.4%) was observed. Siemens showed 95.8 and 95.5% overall agreement with results of Euroimmun and Roche assay, respectively. Euroimmun and Roche assay exhibited 92.6% overall agreement. Discordant results were observed in three COVID-19 patients and in one COVID-19 patient none of the investigated assays detected antibodies. Conclusions The investigated assays were highly specific and sensitive in detecting SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in samples obtained ≥14 days after PCR-confirmed infection. Discordant results need to be investigated in further studies.","Hörber, Sebastian; Soldo, Jelena; Relker, Lasse; Jürgens, Stefan; Guther, Julia; Peter, Silke; Lehmann, Rainer; Peter, Andreas",Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine,https://doi.org/10.1515/cclm-2020-0975; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32745068/,134
155736,Radiofrequency Probe and Sharp Transection for Tenoscopic-Guided Desmotomy of the Accessory Ligament of the Superficial Digital Flexor Tendon.,2015,"BACKGROUND Several articles reported the existence of an association between ABO blood groups and COVID-19 susceptibility. Group A and group O individuals showed a higher and lower risk, respectively, of becoming infected. No association was observed between ABO groups and mortality. To verify this association, we performed a retrospective study of two cohorts of patients with different demographic and clinical characteristics. MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 854 regular blood donors were recruited for convalescent plasma donation after recovering from a mild COVID-19 infection, and a group of 965 patients more severely affected who were transfused during hospitalisation were also included. We also investigated the potential role of the different risk factors on patient outcome and death. To eliminate the confounding effect of risk factors on mortality, a propensity score analysis was performed. RESULTS Blood group A and blood group O COVID-19 blood donors showed a higher and lower risk, respectively, for acquiring COVID-19. In contrast, this association was not found in the group of patients transfused during hospitalisation, probably due to the great differences in demographic and clinical characteristics between the two groups. Regarding severity, age was one of the most significant risk factors. ABO blood groups were also seen to represent important risk factors for COVID-19 severity and mortality. Mortality risk in group A individuals was significantly higher than in group O individuals (OR: 1.75, 95% CI: 1.22-2.51). DISCUSSION The association between the ABO blood groups and the susceptibility to acquire COVID-19 infection was confirmed in the group of blood donors. ABO blood groups were also associated to COVID-19 severity and mortality in the group of patients transfused during hospitalisation. Therefore, blood groups A and O are two important factors to be considered when evaluating the prognosis of patients with COVID-19.","Muñiz-Diaz, Eduardo; Llopis, Jaume; Parra, Rafael; Roig, Imma; Ferrer, Gonzalo; Grifols, Joan; Millán, Anna; Ene, Gabriela; Ramiro, Laia; Maglio, Laura; García, Nadia; Pinacho, Asunción; Jaramillo, Anny; Peró, Agustí; Artaza, Gonzalo; Vallés, Roser; Sauleda, Silvia; Puig, LLuís; Contreras, Enric",Blood transfusion = Trasfusione del sangue,https://doi.org/10.2450/2020.0256-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33196417/,134

156056,Robot-assisted ureteroneocystostomy: technique and comparative outcomes.,2013,"BACKGROUND In randomized controlled trials, lung cancer screening with low-dose chest computed tomography (LCS) has been reported to reduce lung cancer mortality. Although initial studies suggested that only approximately 5% of eligible patients have undergone LCS, recent studies have indicated that use of LCS may be increasing nationwide. The objective of the current study was to estimate recent LCS use using cross-sectional survey data from the 2018 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) survey. METHODS The BRFSS is a nationally representative, cross-sectional telephone survey of adults in the United States (response rate of approximately 50%). The 2018 BRFSS survey included questions regarding LCS eligibility and use in 8 states. The primary outcome was the percentage of participants (aged 55-79 years with a smoking history of >30 pack-years) who reported undergoing LCS. Logistic regression analyses evaluated the association between LCS use and sociodemographic characteristics, adjusted for potential confounders and accounting for complex survey design elements. RESULTS A total of 26,910 participants were included, 9.9% of whom were eligible for LCS (95% CI, 8.8%-10.6%). Of the eligible patients, 19.2% reported undergoing LCS (95% CI, 14.0%-24.4%). Approximately 16.4% of current smokers were eligible for LCS (95% CI, 14.2%-18.6%). In our multiple variable analyses of eligible patients, age, sex, marital status, current smoking status, and race were not found to be associated with statistically significant differences in reported LCS (P > .05). Retired patients, patients with personal physicians, and patients who did not complete a high school education were more likely to report receiving LCS (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS Compared with previously published studies, the results of the current study suggested that LCS use is increasing. However, LCS use remains low (19%) among eligible participants.","Narayan, Anand K; Gupta, Yasha; Little, Brent P; Shepard, Joanne O; Flores, Efren J",Cancer,https://doi.org/10.1002/cncr.33322; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33206388/,134

METHODS We conducted a retrospective, single-center study including COVID-19 patients treated with ECMO. Additionally, we performed a univariate analysis of 85 pre-ECMO variables to identify factors influencing incidences of thromboembolic events (TEE) and bleeding events (BE), respectively. RESULTS Seventeen patients were included; the median age was 57 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 51.5-62), 11 patients were males (65%), median ECMO duration was 16 days (IQR: 10.5-22), and the overall survival was 53%. Twelve patients (71%) developed TEBE. We observed 7 patients (41%) who developed TEE and 10 patients (59%) with BE. Upper respiratory tract (URT) bleeding was the most frequent BE with eight cases (47%). Regarding TEE, pulmonary artery embolism (PAE) had the highest incidence with five cases (29%). The comparison of diverse pre-ECMO variables between patients with and without TEBE detected one statistically significant value. The platelet count was significantly lower in the BE group (n = 10) than in the non-BE group (n = 7) with 209 (IQR: 145-238) versus 452 G/L (IQR: 240-560), with p = 0.007. CONCLUSION This study describes the incidences of TEE and BE in critically ill COVID-19 patients treated with ECMO. The most common adverse event during ECMO support was bleeding, which occurred at a comparable rate to non-COVID-19 patients treated with ECMO.","Durak, Koray; Kersten, Alexander; Grottke, Oliver; Zayat, Rashad; Dreher, Michael; Autschbach, Rüdiger; Marx, Gernot; Marx, Nikolaus; Spillner, Jan; Kalverkamp, Sebastian",The Thoracic and cardiovascular surgeon,https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0041-1725180; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33862633/,134
156192,Bridging the gap between gastric pouch and jejunum: a bariatric nightmare.,2015,"BACKGROUND Nonadditivity in fitness effects from two or more mutations, termed epistasis, can result in compensation of deleterious mutations or negation of beneficial mutations. Recent evidence shows the importance of epistasis in individual evolutionary pathways. However, an unresolved question in molecular evolution is how often and how significantly fitness effects change in alternative genetic backgrounds. RESULTS To answer this question, we quantified the effects of all single mutations and double mutations between all positions in the IgG-binding domain of protein G (GB1). By observing the first two steps of all possible evolutionary pathways using this fitness profile, we were able to characterize the extent and magnitude of pairwise epistasis throughout an entire protein molecule. Furthermore, we developed a novel approach to quantitatively determine the effects of single mutations on structural stability (ΔΔGU). This enabled determination of the importance of stability effects in functional epistasis. CONCLUSIONS Our results illustrate common biophysical mechanisms for occurrences of positive and negative epistasis. Our results show pervasive positive epistasis within a conformationally dynamic network of residues. The stability analysis shows that significant negative epistasis, which is more common than positive epistasis, mostly occurs between combinations of destabilizing mutations. Furthermore, we show that although significant positive epistasis is rare, many deleterious mutations are beneficial in at least one alternative mutational background. The distribution of conditionally beneficial mutations throughout the domain demonstrates that the functional portion of sequence space can be significantly expanded by epistasis.","Olson, C Anders; Wu, Nicholas C; Sun, Ren",Current biology : CB,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2014.09.072; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25455030/,134

In this study, we analyzed the most predominant mutations in the S protein of Brazilian isolates and predicted the effect of these amino acid alterations to protein conformation. A total of 25,924 sequences were obtained from GISAID for five regions of Brazilian territory (Midwest, North, Northeast, South, and Southeast), according to exclusion criteria. Most of the SARS-CoV-2 isolates belongs to the G clade and showed a large occurrence of D614G, N501Y and L18F substitutions. Prediction effects of these amino acid substitutions on the structure dynamics of the spike protein indicated a positive ΔΔG values and negative ΔΔSVib in most cases which is associated to structural stabilization and flexibility reduction of the S protein. Mutations E484K, N501Y and K417N belong to several SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern such as Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta, and showed high incidence among Brazilian isolates. These mutations have been described to increase RBD affinity to ACE-2 host and abolishment of RBD affinity to potent neutralizing ant-RBD.

Excision of burn wounds often leads to significant blood loss requiring transfusion. Accurately estimating blood loss is difficult, so examining the amount of blood products given intraoperatively is a clinically relevant way to measure utilization of this valuable resource. In this study, we examined the factors that influenced the amount of blood given intraoperatively during burn wound excisions. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS A retrospective analysis of patients admitted to a single burn center over 5 years who underwent excision of their burn wounds and received intraoperative blood products was performed. Patient and burn characteristics as well as pertinent surgical data and laboratory values on the day of surgery and postoperatively were gathered. A linear regression analysis examined factors influencing the number of units of products given and a predictive model was generated. RESULTS A total of 563 operations performed on 166 patients were included. The amount of burn excised was the most influential variable on the amount of blood products given. Hemoglobin level, international normalized ratio, and platelet count on the day of surgery were associated with transfusion of different blood products. A predictive model was generated to aid in preoperative ordering of blood products. CONCLUSION The amount of burn excised and common hematology and coagulation lab values were associated with the amount of different blood products administered during burn surgery. The predictive model generated needs to be validated prospectively to aid in preoperative planning for burn excisions.","Rizzo, Julie A; Ross, Evan; Ostrowski, Megan L; Gomez, Brian G; Aden, James K; Cap, Andrew P",Transfusion,https://doi.org/10.1111/trf.16505; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34269462/,134

However, published biomarkers require the measurement of many genes, thereby making it difficult to implement them in clinical practice. This study aims to identify a single-gene biomarker with a high diagnostic accuracy equivalent to multi-gene biomarkers.In this study, we combined an integrated genomic analysis of 1071 individuals with in vitro experiments using well-established infection models.We identified a single-gene biomarker, IFI27, which had a high prediction accuracy (91%) equivalent to that obtained by multi-gene biomarkers. In vitro studies showed that IFI27 was upregulated by TLR7 in plasmacytoid dendritic cells, antigen-presenting cells that responded to influenza virus rather than bacteria. In vivo studies confirmed that IFI27 was expressed in influenza patients but not in bacterial infection, as demonstrated in multiple patient cohorts (n=521). In a large prospective study (n=439) of patients presented with undifferentiated respiratory illness (aetiologies included viral, bacterial and non-infectious conditions), IFI27 displayed 88% diagnostic accuracy (AUC) and 90% specificity in discriminating between influenza and bacterial infections.IFI27 represents a significant step forward in overcoming a translational barrier in applying genomic assay in clinical setting; its implementation may improve the diagnosis and management of respiratory infection.","Tang, Benjamin M; Shojaei, Maryam; Parnell, Grant P; Huang, Stephen; Nalos, Marek; Teoh, Sally; O'Connor, Kate; Schibeci, Stephen; Phu, Amy L; Kumar, Anand; Ho, John; Meyers, Adrienne F A; Keynan, Yoav; Ball, Terry; Pisipati, Amarnath; Kumar, Aseem; Moore, Elizabeth; Eisen, Damon; Lai, Kevin; Gillett, Mark; Geffers, Robert; Luo, Hao; Gul, Fahad; Schreiber, Jens; Riedel, Sandra; Booth, David; McLean, Anthony; Schughart, Klaus",The European respiratory journal,https://doi.org/10.1183/13993003.02098-2016; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28619954/,134
159144,Introduction.,2021-07-01,"OBJECTIVE To ascertain the frequency of maternal and neonatal complications, as well as maternal disease severity, in pregnancies affected by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. DATA SOURCES MEDLINE, Ovid, ClinicalTrials.gov, MedRxiv, and Scopus were searched from their inception until April 29, 2020. The analysis was limited to reports with at least 10 pregnant patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection that reported on maternal and neonatal outcomes. METHODS OF STUDY SELECTION Inclusion criteria were pregnant women with a confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. A systematic search of the selected databases was performed by implementing a strategy that included the MeSH terms, key words, and word variants for ""coronavirus,"" ""SARS-CoV-2,"" ""COVID-19,"" and ""pregnancy.r The primary outcomes were maternal admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), critical disease, and death. Secondary outcomes included rate of preterm birth, cesarean delivery, vertical transmission, and neonatal death. Categorical variables were expressed as percentages with number of cases and 95% CIs. TABULATION, INTEGRATION, AND RESULTS Of the 99 articles identified, 13 included 538 pregnancies complicated by SARS-CoV-2 infection, with reported outcomes on 435 (80.9%) deliveries. Maternal ICU admission occurred in 3.0% of cases (8/263, 95% CI 1.6-5.9) and maternal critical disease in 1.4% (3/209, 95% CI 0.5-4.1). No maternal deaths were reported (0/348, 95% CI 0.0-1.1). The preterm birth rate was 20.1% (57/284, 95% CI 15.8-25.1), the cesarean delivery rate was 84.7% (332/392, 95% CI 80.8-87.9), the vertical transmission rate was 0.0% (0/310, 95% CI 0.0-1.2), and the neonatal death rate was 0.3% (1/313, 95% CI 0.1-1.8). CONCLUSION With data from early in the pandemic, it is reassuring that there are low rates of maternal and neonatal mortality and vertical transmission with SARS-CoV-2. The preterm birth rate of 20% and the cesarean delivery rate exceeding 80% seems related to geographic practice patterns.

We conducted this study to evaluate its feasibility, safety, and efficacy for the treatment of large or giant internal carotid artery aneurysms, which are still challenging with conventional therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS The clinical and angiographic data of 28 patients with 28 large or giant internal carotid artery aneurysms treated with Tubridge flow diverters were prospectively collected and analyzed. RESULTS Thirty-three Tubridge flow diverters were successfully implanted except for 1 poor midstent opening; the result was a technical success rate of 97.0% (32/33). Follow-up angiographies were available for 25 aneurysms; the mean follow-up was 9.9 months (5-24 months). Of the 25 aneurysms, 18 (72.0%) were completely occluded, 6 (24.0%) were improved, and 1 (4.0%) was unchanged. All of the visible covered branches and parent arteries were patent, with no stenosis or obliteration. During a follow-up of 6-30 months (mean, 19 months), symptoms were resolved in 13 patients, improved in 6 patients, and unchanged in 4 patients. Five patients experienced transient clinical deterioration due to a postoperative increased mass effect. Procedure-related morbidity and mortality were both zero. CONCLUSIONS Our preliminary experience shows that the Tubridge flow diverter is a safe and effective tool for treating large and giant internal carotid artery aneurysms. However, multicenter randomized trials and studies involving a long-term follow-up are necessary.","Zhou, Y; Yang, P-F; Fang, Y-B; Xu, Y; Hong, B; Zhao, W-Y; Li, Q; Zhao, R; Huang, Q-H; Liu, J-M",AJNR.

159939,"Radiofrequency versus conventional diathermy Milligan-Morgan hemorrhoidectomy: a prospective, randomized study.",2011,"Foxp3+ CD4 Tregs are central regulators of inflammation, including allergic inflammation in the lung. There is increasing evidence that inflammatory factors undermine adequate Treg functions and homeostasis, resulting in prolonged and exacerbated inflammation. Therefore, identifying the factors is of the utmost important. IL-27 is an antiinflammatory cytokine implicated in immune regulation and tolerance. However, the cellular mechanisms underlying IL-27-mediated immune regulation in vivo remain largely unknown. Utilizing a cockroach antigen-induced allergic inflammation model in mice, we sought to test the roles of Tregs during IL-27-mediated regulation of allergic inflammation. Intranasally delivered IL-27 significantly reduced the development of airway inflammation. Unexpectedly, the IL-27-induced reduction occurred only in the presence of Tregs. Il27ra-/- and Treg-specific Il27ra-/- mice developed severe airway inflammation, and IL-27 treatment had little impact on diminishing the inflammatory responses. IL-27-induced treatment was restored following transfer of WT Tregs but not of Tregs deficient in Lag3, a molecule induced by IL-27 in Tregs. Finally, Tregs from asthmatic patients exhibited blunted STAT1 phosphorylation following IL-27 stimulation. Taken together, our results uncover that Tregs are the primary target cells of IL-27 in vivo to mediate its antiinflammatory functions, suggesting that altered IL-27 responsiveness in Tregs may underlie inadequate Treg functions and perpetuation of inflammation.","Nguyen, Quang Tam; Jang, Eunjung; Le, Hongnga T; Kim, Sohee; Kim, Dongkyun; Dvorina, Nina; Aronica, Mark A; Baldwin, William M; Asosingh, Kewal; Comhair, Suzy; Min, Booki",JCI insight,https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.123216; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30674714/,134

METHODS From July 2011 to July 2016, 45 patients (mean age 73.0±8.8 years; 39 men) with complex aneurysms who were poor candidates for open repair and anatomically ineligible for standard or custom-made FEVAR were treated with chimney FEVAR (chFEVAR). Eight (18%) cases were treated in emergency. In all, 130 target vessels (2.9/patient) were addressed using 21 scallops, 42 open/18 covered chimneys, and 27 custom-made/22 homemade fenestrations. RESULTS Successful aneurysm exclusion, successful reconstruction, and technical success rates were 97.8% (44/45), 98.2% (107/109 vessels excluding the scallops), and 93.3% (42/45). Six (13.3%) patients died within 30 days (5 in hospital). Estimated overall survival, freedom from aneurysm-related death, and freedom from aneurysm-related reintervention were 85.9%, 88.5%, and 59.2%, respectively, at 12 months. The target vessel patency rate was 96.0%. At latest follow-up, 1 type Ia and 3 type II endoleaks were present. Sac shrinkage occurred in 18 (54%) patients. CONCLUSION Combined chFEVAR showed good technical feasibility and could be an effective approach in emergent settings and highly selective cases when FEVAR is not feasible. Thirty-day mortality, target vessel patency, and type Ia endoleak rates were acceptable.","Caradu, Caroline; Morin, Julien; Midy, Dominique; Lepidi, Sandro; Ducasse, Eric",Journal of endovascular therapy : an official journal of the International Society of Endovascular Specialists,https://doi.org/10.1177/1526602817713472; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28602114/,134

If there is a higher accumulation of Hcy in the blood, i.e. usually above 15 µmol/L, it leads to a condition referred to as hyperhomocysteinemia. A meta-analysis of observational study suggested an elevated concentration of Hcy in blood, which is termed as the risk factors leading to ischemic heart disease (IHD) and stroke. Further experimental studies stated that Hcy can lead to an increase in the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells and functional impairment of endothelial cells. The analyses confirmed some of the predictors for Hcy presence, such as serum uric acid (UA), systolic blood pressure, and hematocrit. However, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ARBs) (except losartan) alone are inadequate for controlling UA and creatinine level, although the addition of folic acid may be beneficial in hypertensive patients who are known to have a high prevalence of elevated Hcy. We hypothesized that combination therapy with an ARB (olmesartan) and folic acid is a promising treatment for lowering the UA and creatinine level in hyperhomocysteinemia associated hypertension.

BACKGROUND Caregiver burnout is a concern that needs to be addressed at the organizational level so that professionals can reduce their risk of psychological injury while providing high-quality care. The COVID-19 (novel coronavirus) pandemic has exacerbated symptoms of burnout among nurses nationally. METHODS Ten sessions of daylong resilience retreats were delivered to independent groups of nurses, nurse practitioners, and other healthcare professionals. Preretreat and postretreat assessments were completed using a 19-item survey developed by the research team to assess state anxiety, intention to engage in mindfulness practices, and self-efficacy around mindfulness. RESULTS One hundred six healthcare professionals completed the resilience retreats. There was a statistically significant decrease in state anxiety scores following the retreat. The majority of the participants reported high intentions to engage in mindfulness practices and felt confident about incorporating mindfulness in their lives. CONCLUSIONS Brief resilience retreats endorsed by nurse leadership can reduce perceived anxiety and facilitate engagement in contemplative practices, which are associated with a decrease in the risk of burnout.","Cunningham, Tim; Çayir, Ebru",The Journal of nursing administration,https://doi.org/10.1097/nna.0000000000000987; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33570373/,134

Early detection through screening with locally-validated tools can improve outcomes. METHODS We searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Global Health, Cochrane Library, Web of Science and Google Scholar for articles on the validation of screening tools for common mental disorders in perinatal women in India, with no language or date restrictions. Quality was assessed using the QUADAS-2 tool. We used bivariate and hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic models to calculate pooled summary estimates of sensitivity and specificity. Heterogeneity was assessed by visualising the distance of individual studies from the summary curve. RESULTS Seven studies involving 1003 women were analysed. All studies assessed the validity of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) in identifying perinatal depression. No validation studies of any other screening tools were identified. Using a common threshold of ≥13 the EPDS had a pooled sensitivity and specificity of 88·9% (95%CI 77·4-94·9) and 93·4 (95%CI 81·5-97·8), respectively. Using optimal thresholds (range ≥ 9 to ≥13) the EPDS had a pooled sensitivity and specificity of 94·4% (95%CI 81·7-98·4) and 90·8 (95%CI 83·7-95·0), respectively. CONCLUSION The EPDS is psychometrically valid in diverse Indian settings and its use in routine maternity care could improve detection of perinatal depression. Further research is required to validate screening tools for other perinatal common mental disorders in India.","Fellmeth, Gracia; Harrison, Siân; Opondo, Charles; Nair, Manisha; Kurinczuk, Jennifer J; Alderdice, Fiona",BMC psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-021-03190-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33879130/,134

The newest among them today are the ultrasonically activated devices, which are utilized with a great deal of components in-play, including ergonomics and financial aspects amid surgery. The methodology embraced was finding significant investigations through studies from PubMed, Medline and Google Scholar on current ultrasonic dissectors, which are Ethicon's Harmonic Scalpel (ACE®), Covidien's Sonicision™ (SNC), Conmed's SonoSurg® (SS) and Olympus's Thunderbeat®, to describe their efficacy in terms of vessel sealing speed, vessel burst pressure, visibility, operation time and thermal speed. We found postmarketing evidence to determine which device exhibits the better performance. Animal studies showed that emissivity values and maximum temperatures for coagulation are similar among devices but maximum cutting temperatures are significantly different: ACE = 191.1°C, SNC = 227.1°C, SS = 184.8°C (p < 0.001). Cooling times are significantly different among devices: 35.7 s for ACE, 38.7 s for SNC and 27.4 s for SS (p < 0.001). Cooling times of passive jaws to reach 60°C after activation were also significantly different: 25.4 s for ACE, 5.7 s for SNC, and 15.4 s for SS (p < 0.001).

A sociodemographic scale was designed to identify the hours dedicated to work before and during confinement and to evaluate professional burnout, the adaptation of the MBI instrument for the Colombian population was used (Barbato, Córdoba, González, Martínez & Tamayo, 2011)ResultsA 50% increase in the workload of teachers was observed during confinement, besides, a statistically significant correlation between professional burnout and the increase in hours dedicated to work (Table 1)ConclusionsIt was possible to conclude that the significant increase in the workload in teachers correlates positively with levels of emotional exhaustion and depersonalization;however, no correlations were observed between workload and personal achievement of higher education teachers.","Ruiz Gonzalez, E.

This paper presents the development of a web application to meet these needs, the Facility Infection Risk Estimator?, and its underlying Wells?Riley based model. The model specifically estimates (a) the removal efficiencies of various settling, ventilation, filtration and virus inactivation strategies and (b) the associated probability of infection, given the room physical parameters and number of individuals infected present with either influenza or SARS-CoV-2. A review of the underlying calculations and associated literature is provided, along with the model's validation against two documented spreading events. The error between modelled and actual number of additional people infected, normalized by the number of uninfected people present, ranged from roughly ?18.4% to +9.7%. The more certain one can be regarding the input parameters (such as for new designs or existing buildings with adequate field verification), the smaller these normalized errors will be, likely less than ±15%, making it useful for comparing the impacts of different risk mitigation strategies focused on airborne transmission.","Harmon, Marcel Lau Josephine",Indoor and Built Environment,https://doi.org/10.1177/1420326x211039544,134

One of the major complications of this disease is the rapid and dangerous pulmonary deterioration that can lead to critical pneumonia conditions, resulting in death. The current healthcare system around the world faces the potential problem of lacking resources to assist a large number of patients at the same time;then, the non-critical patients are mostly referred to perform self-isolation/quarantine at home. With the advancement of IoT and Cloud technologies now it is possible to monitor patient's symptoms in real-time to detect and quickly report sudden and dangerous changes to the healthcare provider. In this paper, we propose the concept of R-Mon, an mhealth tool for diagnostic-assistance, and real-time communication with healthcare providers that can be used with COVID-19 patients in self-isolation and any other disease in pandemic situations. We propose the use of a pressure sensor under the bed that can monitor the respiratory rate and pulmonary function of the patients. We also propose a framework in which the detected information can be directly seen by the practitioner for the decision-making process. We envision that this kind of mhealth tool and framework can be implemented for better health response in future pandemics.","Valero, M.; Shahriar, H.; Ahamed, S.

In such a setting, it is important to focus communication efforts to reach the different audience groups and ensure common understanding and willingness to act by all the groups in order to achieve the institution?s mission of curbing the pandemic. This study contributes to these efforts by examining the mediating effect of interaction resonance in the relationship between information adequacy and strategic behavioral change communication. The study adopted a cross sectional survey design that involved collecting quantitative data from 223 health organizations of Uganda?s health sector in the different regions of the country. In order to test the study hypotheses, the study used Structural Equation Modeling of AMOS and the bootstrapping approach to test the mediating role of interaction resonance. The results revealed that interaction resonance fully mediates in the relationship between information adequacy and strategic behavioral change communication. This implied that having adequate information per say, does not cause behavioral change among the intended message recipients but requires a communication system that enables high quality interactions.","Bashir, Hassan Nangoli Sudi Musaasizi Yunia Nakajubi Florence Basemera Mellan Ayibo Christine",International Journal of Business Communication,https://doi.org/10.1177/23294884211027545,134

184918,Reduced Port Distal Gastrectomy With a Multichannel Port Plus One Puncture (POP).,2015,"Methods for prediction of fluid responsiveness are needed during shock resuscitation. Fluid therapy remains a cornerstone in the treatment of shock and influences the outcomes directly. Excess or insufficient fluid administration is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Prediction of fluid responsiveness means that a hemodynamic variable is used to determine how likely a patient is to respond to fluid bolus with a significant increase in their cardiac output. Depending on the response to fluids, patients are either responders or non-responders. Clinicians often rely on static indices of preload, like central venous pressure and pulmonary artery occlusion pressure, as a guide for fluid therapy. Unfortunately, whilst easy for use, these indices are of minimal value as predictors of fluid responsiveness. More recent research highlights hemodynamic variables related to cardiopulmonary interactions during mechanical ventilation. These dynamic indices, viz. stroke volume variation and pulse pressure variation, show a significantly better predictive value. To maximize the predictive value of dynamic indices, several conditions must be fulfilled. Another method for prediction of fluid responsiveness is represented by the functional hemodynamic tests: a heterogenous group of bedside tests for preload responsiveness. Fluid challenges remain popular, although repetitive use can be harmful. Hemodynamic tests, like passive leg raising or end-expiratory occlusion, modify the preload without fluid administration. Regardless of the test used, monitoring of cardiac output is needed to evaluate the heart's response to changes in preload. This review gives an overview of the methods for fluid responsiveness prediction, including those explored in the COVID-19 context.","Enev, R.; Krastev, P.; Abedinov, F.",Biotechnology & Biotechnological Equipment,https://doi.org/10.1080/13102818.2021.1960190,134

An investigation of pathogenesis in children may help to analyze the therapies for the high-risk population. Human angiotensin-converting enzyme Ⅱ is the main receptor of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and can limit pulmonary capillary leakage and inflammation mediated by angiotensin 2 and exert a protective effect against acute lung injury. Its expression decreases with age. Regular vaccination and frequent upper respiratory virus infection in children can lead to regular immune activation, and its combination with strong innate immunity can help to achieve virus clearance in the early stage of infection in children with COVID-19. Meanwhile, there are strong regeneration and repair abilities of alveolar epithelial cells in children, which may help with the early recovery of infection. In addition, risk factors, such as underlying cardiopulmonary diseases, obesity, and smoking, are relatively uncommon in children. Social factors, including home quarantine and timely closure of schools, may help to reduce the infection rate in children. However, children with immunodeficiency are a high-risk population and should be closely monitored. Further studies are needed to investigate the immune and protection mechanisms against COVID-19 in children.","Deng, Quan-Min; Liang, Ping; Liu, Han-Min",Zhongguo dang dai er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of contemporary pediatrics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33840417/,134
187153,Efficacy of Human Fibrinogen-Thrombin Patch (TachoSil) Clinical Application in Upper Gastrointestinal Cancer Surgery.,2016,"BACKGROUND Hypotension due to the induction of sedation with dexmedetomidine infusion may be harmful in critically ill patients. Changes in pulse pressure induced by the passive leg raising test (PLR-ΔPP) as marker of fluid responsiveness, assessed prior to sedation, may predict hemodynamic changes. The present study was to investigate the power of the PLR test in critically ill patients in predicting hypotension induced by the induction of dexmedetomidine sedation. METHODS Fluid responsiveness was estimated by a passive leg raising (PLR) test before dexmedetomidine sedation. Patients were assigned to either the ""Nonresponders"" or ""Responders"" group according to their hemodynamic responses to the PLR test (""Nonresponders"", PLR-ΔPP < 10.3%; ""Responders"", PLR-ΔPP ≥ 10.3%). Sedation was performed with a dexmedetomidine infusion (0.5 µg/kg over a 10-minute loading period, then 0.2 - 0.7 µg×kg(-1)×h(-1)) and titrated to maintain the target Richmond agitation sedation scale (RASS) score in the range of -2 to -1 and the bispectral index value in the range of 60 to 75. Radial artery pulse pressure, heart rate (HR), and central venous pressure (CVP) were measured at each phase of the study procedure. Hemodynamic fluctuations during the use of dexmedetomidine sedation were recorded and compared between the two groups. RESULTS Fifty patients had a median (25% - 75% interquartile range) of 71 (61 - 78) years old were studied. At baseline, 39 of the 50 patients were ""Nonresponders"" and 11 were ""Responders"". Following dexmedetomidine sedation, patients classified as ""Responders"" had a significantly greater systolic blood pressure decrease during the induction of dexmedetomidine sedation than the ""Nonresponders"" ((-26.3 ± 6.8)% vs. -11.8 ± 8.5)%, P < 0.001). In addition, the ""Responders"" group required significantly more fluid boluses (8 vs. 3; P < 0.001) and vasopressors (2 vs. 0; P < 0.05) than the ""Nonresponders"" group to restore blood pressure. Finally, PLR-ΔPP was positively correlated with changes in systolic blood pressure (PLR-ΔSBP) (r(2) = 0.576; P < 0.001) and significantly correlated with dexmedetomidine infusion-induced changes in SBP (r(2) = 0.202; P < 0.05). AUC for PLR-ΔPP was 0.84 (95%CI 0.71 - 0.93). PLR-ΔPP predicted hypotension with a sensitivity of 73% and a specificity of 92%. CONCLUSIONS The fluid responsiveness assessment pre-sedation was found to predict blood pressure fluctuation during the induction of dexmedetomidine sedation. The PLR test conducted prior to sedation may be a useful tool to identify patients with a high risk of hemodynamic events and may be used to indicate the need for prophylactic treatment.","Yu, Tao; Pan, Chun; Guo, Feng-mei; Yang, Yi; Qiu, Hai-bo",Chinese medical journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23823816/,134

187313,Medication Errors.,2016,"Respiratory bovine coronaviruses (RBCV) emerged as an infectious agent most frequently isolated from respiratory tract samples of cattle with acute respiratory tract diseases. Infectivity-neutralizing (IN) and hemagglutinin-inhibiting (HAI) antibodies induced by RBCV infections were monitored in sequential serum samples collected from cattle during a naturally evolving and experimentally monitored epizootic of shipping fever pneumonia (SFP). Cattle nasally shedding RBCV at the beginning of the epizootic started with low levels of serum IN and HAI antibodies. An increase in serum IN antibody after day 7 led to reduction of virus shedding in nasal secretions by the majority of the cattle between days 7 and 14. A substantial rise in the serum HAI antibody was observed during the initial phase among the sick but not the clinically normal cattle which were infected with RBCV. The RBCV isolation-positive cattle that developed fatal SFP had minimal serum IN and HAI antibodies during the course of disease development. Cattle that remained negative in RBCV isolation tests entered this epizootic with high levels of serum IN and HAI antibodies, which dramatically increased during the next two weeks. Protection against SFP was apparently associated with significantly higher levels of serum IN antibodies at the beginning of the epizootic. The RBCV-neutralizing activity is associated with serum immunoglobulin G (IgG), particularly the IgG2 subclass, while RBCV-specific HAI antibody is related to both serum IgG and IgM fractions.","Lin, X; O'Reilly, K L; Burrell, M L; Storz, J",Clinical and diagnostic laboratory immunology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11238222/,134

Previously, we established a trans-cleavage assay and showed that PLP2 cleaves the replicase polyprotein between p210 and membrane protein 1 (MP1) (A. Kanjanahaluethai and S. C. Baker, J. Virol. 74:7911-7921, 2000). Here, we report the results of our studies identifying and characterizing this cleavage site. To determine the approximate position of the cleavage site, we expressed constructs that extended various distances upstream from the previously defined C-terminal end of MP1. We found that the construct extending from the putative PLP2 cleavage site at glycine 2840-alanine 2841 was most similar in size to the processed MP1 replicase product generated in a trans-cleavage assay. To determine which amino acids are critical for PLP2 recognition and processing, we generated 14 constructs with amino acid substitutions upstream and downstream of the putative cleavage site and assessed the effects of the mutations in the PLP2 trans-cleavage assay. We found that substitutions at phenylalanine 2835, glycine 2839, or glycine 2840 resulted in a reduction in cleavage of MP1. Finally, to unequivocally identify this cleavage site, we isolated radiolabeled MP1 protein and determined the position of [(35)S]methionine residues released by Edman degradation reaction. We found that the amino-terminal residue of MP1 corresponds to alanine 2841. Therefore, murine coronavirus PLP2 cleaves the replicase polyprotein between glycine 2840 and alanine 2841, and the critical determinants for PLP2 recognition and processing occupy the P6, P2, and P1 positions of the cleavage site. This study is the first report of the identification and characterization of a cleavage site recognized by murine coronavirus PLP2 activity.","Kanjanahaluethai, Amornrat; Jukneliene, Dalia; Baker, Susan C",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12805436/,134

SARS-CoV infection was monitored by quantitative RT-PCR, immunofluorescence analysis and recovery experiments. SARS-CoV infected both immature and mature DCs, although replication efficiency was low. Immature DCs were activated by SARS-CoV infection and by UV-inactivated SARS-CoV. Infected DCs were still viable on day 6 post-infection, but major histocompatibility complex class I upregulation was missing, indicating that DC function was impaired. Additionally, SARS-CoV infection induced a delayed activation of IFN-alpha expression.

We employed online database analysis to compare the differences in the amino acid sequences of the homologous T epitopes of HCoV-229e and SARS-CoV. The identified T-cell epitope peptides were synthesized, and their binding affinities for HLA-A2 were validated and compared in the T2 cell system. The immunogenicity of all these peptides was assessed by using T cells obtained from donors who had fully recovered from SARS-CoV infection and from healthy donors with no history of SARS-CoV infection. HLA-A2 typing by indirect immunofluorescent antibody staining showed that 51.6% of SARS-CoV-infected patients were HLA-A2 positive. Online database analysis and the T2 cell binding test disclosed that the number of HLA-A2-restricted immunogenic epitopes of the S protein of SARS-CoV was decreased or even lost in comparison with the homologous sequences of the S protein of HCoV-229e. Among the peptides used in the study, the affinity of peptides from HCoV-229e (H77 and H881) and peptides from SARS-CoV (S978 and S1203) for binding to HLA-A2 was higher than that of other sequences. The gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) release Elispot assay revealed that only SARS-CoV-specific peptides S1203 and S978 induced a high frequency of IFN-gamma-secreting T-cell response in HLA-A2(+) donors who had fully recovered from SARS-CoV infection; such a T-cell epitope-specific response was not observed in HLA-A2(+) healthy donors or in HLA-A2(-) donors who had been infected with SARS-CoV after full recovery.

191645,Post-ICU Care in the Outpatient Setting.,2021-05-15,"RATIONALE The acute respiratory distress syndrome is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients. Angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1), a ligand for the endothelial Tie2 receptor, is an endothelial survival and vascular stabilization factor that reduces endothelial permeability and inhibits leukocyte-endothelium interactions. OBJECTIVES We hypothesized that Ang-1 counteracts vascular inflammation and pulmonary vascular leak in experimental acute lung injury. METHODS We used cell-based gene therapy in a rat model of ALI. Transgenic mice overexpressing Ang-1 or deficient in the Tie2 receptor were also studied to better elucidate the mechanisms of protection. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS The present report provides data that support a strong protective role for the Ang-1/Tie2 system in two experimental models of LPS-induced acute lung injury. In a rat model, cell-based Ang-1 gene transfer improved morphological, biochemical, and molecular indices of lung injury and inflammation. These findings were confirmed in a gain-of-function conditional, targeted transgenic mouse model, in which Ang-1 reduced endothelial cell activation and the expression of adhesion molecules, associated with a marked improvement in airspace inflammation and intraalveolar septal thickening. Moreover, heterozygous Tie2-deficient mice demonstrated enhanced evidence of lung injury and increased early mortality. CONCLUSIONS These results support a critical role for the Ang-1/Tie2 axis in modulating the pulmonary vascular response to lung injury and suggest that Ang-1 therapy may represent a potential new strategy for the treatment and/or prevention of acute respiratory distress syndrome in critically ill patients.","McCarter, Sarah D; Mei, Shirley H J; Lai, Patrick F H; Zhang, Qiu Wang; Parker, Colleen H; Suen, Renée S; Hood, Roberta D; Zhao, Yidan D; Deng, Yupu; Han, Robin N N; Dumont, Daniel J; Stewart, Duncan J",American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17322110/,134

192671,Immunohistochemical screening for viral agents in cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus) with myelopathy.,2006,"This study applied bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) to children with congenital heart disease (CHD) prior to elective cardiac catheterization (n = 48), to determine the influence of pulmonary blood flow and viral infection on the alveolar epithelial lining fluid (ELF) concentration of leucocytes, protein and endothelin-1 (ET-1). Lower respiratory tract (LRT) viral infection was defined as either a positive immunofluorescence for virus, or a virus cultured from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Haemodynamic status was determined at cardiac catheterization. Normative data for BALF, but not ELF parameters, were obtained from 26 asymptomatic, noninfected normal children undergoing elective surgery. In the absence of LRT infection, the BALF macrophage, lymphocyte and neutrophil differential in CHD was not significantly different from the normal controls. In CHD, both increased pulmonary-to-systemic flow ratio (Q'p/Q's) and increased pulmonary artery-to-left ventricular pressure ratio PAP/LVP were associated with a decrease in ELF protein (rs = -0.59; p < 0.0001; and rs = -0.50; p < 0.0001 respectively). A respiratory virus was isolated from the BALF in 8 (17%) of CHD children. Virus isolation was associated with an increased ELF total protein (p < 0.05 vs no infection), a decreased alveolar macrophage differential count (p < 0.01), and an increased neutrophil differential count (p < 0.05). ET-1 was detected in the BALF of 83% of the noninfected CHD children compared to only 23% of the controls (p < 0.001). ELF ET-1 concentrations did not correlate with haemodynamic status in CHD, but were up to 100 times higher than paired plasma levels. We conclude that, in congenital heart disease, both lower respiratory tract viral infection and increased pulmonary blood flow and/or pulmonary vascular pressure influence the alveolar milieu. High alveolar epithelial lining fluid concentrations of endothelin-1 occur in congenital heart disease, but the stimulus for pulmonary endothelin-1 production is unclear.","Grigg, J; Kleinert, S; Woods, R L; Thomas, C J; Vervaart, P; Wilkinson, J L; Robertson, C F",The European respiratory journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8836647/,134
192714,Parrot proventricular dilation disease.,2008,"Five neonatal Pallas' cats (Otocolobus manul) at the Oklahoma City Zoo died from toxoplasmosis with concurrent herpesvirus infection. These multiple infections suggested underlying immunodeficiency, perhaps caused by concurrent infection with feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV); so blood samples were collected for serology, serum protein electrophoresis, lymphocyte proliferation assays, and cytokine analysis by reverse transcriptase-quantitative competitive polymerase chain reaction (RT-qcPCR). Resulting data were compared with data from FIV-infected and control domestic short-haired cats. In addition, peripheral blood mononuclear cell cultures were propagated to detect FIV virus by both RT-qcPCR and detection of reverse transcriptase activity. Serum protein electrophoresis showed that four of six Pallas' cats had increased alpha, globulins. At least two Pallas' cats had decreased lymphoproliferation responses to mitogen. and all three tested animals exhibited defective interleukin-12 gene expression. Although these clinical and laboratory findings suggested an immunodeficiency syndrome, FIV infection could not be confirmed. On the basis of repeated blood test results, it can be concluded that nutritional, metabolic, or other systemic problems probably did not contribute to the disease syndrome. Further investigation of other possible causes of immunodeficiency, including a possible genetic component, in this population is needed.","Ketz-Riley, Cornelia J; Ritchey, Jerry W; Hoover, John P; Johnson, Calvin M; Barrie, Michael T",Journal of zoo and wildlife medicine : official publication of the American Association of Zoo Veterinarians,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14582784/,134

Here we describe conditions that result not only in the efficient expression of the SARS-CoV spike (S) protein on the surface of cells, but in its incorporation into lentiviral particles that can be used to transduce cells in an S glycoprotein-dependent manner. We found that although some primate cell lines, including Vero E6, 293T and Huh-7 cells, could be efficiently transduced by SARS-CoV S glycoprotein pseudoviruses, other cells lines were either resistant or very poorly permissive to virus entry. Infection by pseudovirions could be inhibited by several lysosomotropic agents, suggesting a requirement for acidification of endosomes for efficient S-mediated viral entry. In addition, we were able to develop a cell-cell fusion assay that could be used to monitor S glycoprotein-dependent membrane fusion. Although proteolysis did not enhance the infectivity of cell-free pseudovirions, trypsin activation is required for cell-cell fusion. Additionally, there was no apparent pH requirement for S glycoprotein-mediated cell-cell fusion. Together, these studies describe important tools that can be used to study SARS-CoV S glycoprotein structure and function, including approaches that can be used to identify inhibitors of the entry of SARS-CoV into target cells.","Simmons, Graham; Reeves, Jacqueline D; Rennekamp, Andrew J; Amberg, Sean M; Piefer, Andrew J; Bates, Paul",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15010527/,134

METHODS Fifty consecutive ruptured aneurysms of the MCA and 209 aneurysms at other anatomical locations were selected retrospectively. We compared epidemiological, clinical and radiological variables, prognosis and complications. RESULTS The MCA aneurysms had a greater size and a poor dome/neck ratio. There were no significant differences in endovascular technique complications, occlusion rate or rebleeding between the two groups (p > 0.1). There were no significant differences in the mortality and number of dependent patients after one month. CONCLUSION The endovascular treatment of ruptured MCA aneurysms without hematoma is as safe and effective as other aneurysm localizations. Complication rates, occlusion rates and rebleeding of ruptured MCA aneurysms are comparable to other locations.","Murias Quintana, Eduardo; Vega Valdés, Pedro; Morales Deza, Edison; Gil Garcia, Alberto; Cuellar, Hugo; Costilla García, Serafín; Cadenas Rodríguez, María; Delgado, Montserrat Gonzalez; Peña Suárez, Jorge; Santamarta Liébana, Elena; López-García, Antonio","Interventional neuroradiology : journal of peritherapeutic neuroradiology, surgical procedures and related neurosciences",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27530136/,134

Three of those genes, called X4, X5 and ORF10, were synthesized and introduced into E. coli to induce expression. SDS-PAGE and Western blotting revealed that the three genes have been expressed in E. coli. The induction of SARS PUPs genes expression in different temperatures, induction times, IPTG concentrations and A values of E. coli cells were performed. The optimal induction condition of SARS-CoV PUPs genes was characterized according to the orthorgonal analysis.

196654,Full-Thickness Interrupted Ligation with Transhepatic Suturing (the FILTH Technique): A Novel Technique for Hepatic Trauma.,2019,"Recently, Missouri has followed an overall upward trend in opioid overdose deaths. In 2018, Missouri was the state with the largest absolute and percentage increase in opioid-related overdose fatality rates per capita over the previous year (18.3% and 3.1/100,000). This increase occurred despite an overall decrease in U.S. opioid-related death rates in the same period. This report identifies illicitly manufactured fentanyl (IMF) (and analogues) as the drug most responsible for this rise in opioid deaths in Missouri, with stimulant overdoses (primarily from methamphetamine) in second place. Within Missouri, we find the areas where opioid deaths are highest: St. Louis and the city's fringe areas, following the national trend for high rates in fringe areas. Based on reports from CDC Wonder data, county medical examiners, law enforcement agencies, and drug addiction prevention agencies, we conclude that IMF and related synthetic opioids arriving from China are primarily responsible for fatal narcotic overdoses in Missouri. Despite the COVID-19 disruption of fentanyl manufacturing and distribution centers in and around Wuhan, China early in the pandemic, preliminary 2020 data from medical examiners' offices show an upswing in opioid deaths, an indicator that Chinese fentanyl producers have restored the supply chain.","Stoecker, William V; Bosworth, K Taylor; Rottnek, Fred",Missouri medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32848274/,134

A recently isolated virus, stunting syndrome agent, (SSA) has been found to be the etiologic agent of SS. The objective of the present study was to determine relatedness of the SSA with other viral agents. Serologic (viral neutralization and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA]) assays and a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were used. The antisera against turkey enteric coronavirus (bluecomb agent), bovine coronavirus (BCV), bovine Breda-1 virus, bovine Breda-2 virus, avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), avian influenza virus, Newcastle disease virus (NDV), and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) of swine were evaluated by dot-immunobinding avidin-biotin-enhanced ELISA and did not react with SSA. The homologous (anti-SSA) antiserum was positive by ELISA. Similarly, anti-SSA antiserum did not react when NDV, IBV, BCV, or TGEV was used as antigen but did react with the homologous (SSA) virus. The virus neutralization assay was performed by inoculating 24-to-25-day-old turkey embryos via the amniotic route and by assessing the embryo infectivity on the basis of gross intestinal lesions and intestinal maltase activity at 72 hr postinoculation. None of the aforementioned antisera neutralized SSA infectivity in embryos except for the homologous anti-SSA antiserum. A RT-PCR was performed with known primers specific for NDV, IBV, BCV, and TGEV. The known primers failed to amplify SSA genome but amplified their respective viral genomes. We concluded that the SSA was distinct from the viral agents that were evaluated.","Ali, A; Reynolds, D L",Avian diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10737643/,134

METHODS Patients who underwent DHC for ischemic stroke were extracted from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (2002-2011). Multivariable logistic regression examined in-hospital mortality and a poor outcome (death, tracheostomy and gastrostomy, or discharge to institutional care). Covariates included year of admission, comorbidities, severity indices, and treatment variables (including the timing of decompression). RESULTS Craniectomy was performed in 1673 patients: 62.4 % were aged 18-60 years, 20.6 % aged 61-70 years, and 17.0 % aged greater than 70 years. DHC was associated with reduced adjusted odds of in-hospital death compared with medical treatment alone among patients with cerebral edema in all age categories, including those older than 70 years (p ≤ 0.008). However, among surgical patients, the adjusted odds of mortality were significantly greater for patients aged 61-70 (30.7 %, p = 0.02) and greater than 70 years (34.5 %, p = 0.02), but not different for patients aged 51-60 (22.8 %), compared to those aged 18-50 years (19.7 %). The adjusted odds of a poor outcome also increased significantly with age, particularly for patients greater than 60 years. CONCLUSION In this nationwide analysis, DHC was associated with reduced mortality regardless of patient age, including among those aged greater than 70 years. However, patients aged greater than 60 years treated surgically experienced higher odds of mortality (32.4 %), discharge to institutional care (47.1 %), and a poor outcome (77.0 %) compared with younger patients.","Dasenbrock, Hormuzdiyar H; Robertson, Faith C; Aziz-Sultan, M Ali; Guittieres, Donovan; Du, Rose; Dunn, Ian F; Gormley, William B",Neurocritical care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27406817/,134

It`s elimination may not be fast enough for short procedures. In orally premedicated patients we obtained midazolam plasma concentrations at the end of surgical procedures and compared those to concentrations at anesthesia induction. METHODS The study was conducted prospectively with consent of the local ethics committee (Ethikkomission Kanton Thurgau, Switzerland) and carried out with written informed consent of each patient. Female patients aged 20 to 60 years undergoing elective procedures with general anesthesia were included, and were divided in two groups according to the planned surgical time: group S (<30 min) and group L (90-120 min), respectively. All patients received 7.5 mg Midazolam po as premedication. Blood samples were drawn at anesthesia induction, and at the end of surgery. Data were compared with t-test (independent samples; significance level p <0.05). RESULTS Twenty-five patients per group were included. Four patients were excluded from analysis, since midazolam was not detectable in any samples. Time of premedication to the 1st blood sample was not statistically different between groups, neither were Midazolam plasma levels at this time point (p = 0.94). None of the patients from group L (n = 24), but five patients in group S (n = 22) did have a higher plasma level of Midazolam at the end of the case compared to the beginning. CONCLUSIONS The elimination half-life of oral Midazolam can lead to higher plasma levels at the end of a short procedure compared to those at induction of anesthesia.

RESULTS Exposure to ailing patients and occurrence of the disease ranged from minimal to close contact, such as between patient and health care personnel. The incubation period ranged from 1 to 11 days. All patients presented fever, and some of them complained of rigor, dry cough, dyspnea, malaise, headache, and hypoxemia. Physical examination of the chest revealed bubbling rales and dullness on percussion. Lymphopenia was observed in 80% of all patients, and some patients had mildly elevated aminotransferase levels but normal serum creatinine levels. Serial chest radiographs showed progressive inflammatory changes. One patient died of progressive respiratory failure; pathological examination of the lung showed diffuse alveolar damage. One patient died of suicide. There was no evidence of infection by Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, or Legionella pneumophila. All patients received corticosteroid and ribavirin therapy for a mean of (18.6+/-5.4) days after the onset of symptoms, and were treated with a combination of beta-lactams and macrolide early for (4.0+/-1.9)days, but with no clinical or radiologic evidences of improvement.

200704,Time for leadership and conversations,2020,"Coronaviruses synthesize a nested set of six to eight subgenomic (sg) mRNAs in infected cells. These mRNAs are produced in different, but constant, molar ratios. It is unclear which factors control the different levels of sg mRNAs. To determine whether the intergenic sequence (IS) involved in sg mRNA synthesis could affect the transcription efficiencies of other ISs and in this way regulate transcription levels, we inserted multiple ISs at different positions into a mouse hepatitis virus defective interfering RNA. Quantitation of the sg RNAs produced by identical ISs in different sequence contexts led to the following conclusions: (i) transcription efficiency depends on the location of the IS in the defective interfering virus genome, (ii) downstream ISs have a negative effect on transcription levels from upstream ISs, and (iii) upstream ISs have little or no effect on downstream ISs. The observation that a downstream IS downregulates the amounts of sg RNA produced by an upstream IS explains why the smaller sg RNAs are, in general, produced in larger quantities than the larger sg RNAs. Our data are consistent with coronavirus transcription models in which ISs attenuate transcription. In these models, larger sg RNAs are synthesized in smaller amounts because they encounter more attenuating ISs during their synthesis.","van Marle, G; Luytjes, W; van der Most, R G; van der Straaten, T; Spaan, W J",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7494297/,134

243970,Challenges and potential solutions in the development of COVID-19 pandemic control measures,2021,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic poses a serious threat to global health, and pathogenic mutations are a major challenge to disease control. We developed a statistical framework to explore the association between molecular-level mutation activity of SARS-CoV-2 and population-level disease transmissibility of COVID-19. METHODS: We estimated the instantaneous transmissibility of COVID-19 by using the time-varying reproduction number (Rt). The mutation activity in SARS-CoV-2 is quantified empirically depending on (i) the prevalence of emerged amino acid substitutions and (ii) the frequency of these substitutions in the whole sequence. Using the likelihood-based approach, a statistical framework is developed to examine the association between mutation activity and Rt. We adopted the COVID-19 surveillance data in California as an example for demonstration. RESULTS: We found a significant positive association between population-level COVID-19 transmissibility and the D614G substitution on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. We estimate that a per 0.01 increase in the prevalence of glycine (G) on codon 614 is positively associated with a 0.49% (95% CI: 0.39 to 0.59) increase in Rt, which explains 61% of the Rt variation after accounting for the control measures. We remark that the modeling framework can be extended to study other infectious pathogens. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show a link between the molecular-level mutation activity of SARS-CoV-2 and population-level transmission of COVID-19 to provide further evidence for a positive association between the D614G substitution and Rt. Future studies exploring the mechanism between SARS-CoV-2 mutations and COVID-19 infectivity are warranted.","Zhao, Shi; Lou, Jingzhi; Cao, Lirong; Zheng, Hong; Chong, Marc K C; Chen, Zigui; Zee, Benny C Y; Chan, Paul K S; Wang, Maggie H",Theor Biol Med Model,,134

METHODS: twenty-two patients with BE diagnosed by upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy with biopsies and ED diagnosed by conventional esophageal manometry (CEM) were submitted to a LNF, and followed up with clinical evaluations, upper GI endoscopy with biopsies and CEM, for a minimum of 12 months after the surgical procedure. RESULTS: : sixteen patients were male (72.7%) and six were females (27.3%). The mean age was 55.14 (± 15.52) years old. and the mean postoperative follow-up was 26.2 months. The upper GI endoscopy showed that the mean length of BE was 4.09 cm preoperatively and 3.91cm postoperatively (p=0.042). The evaluation of esophageal dysmotility through conventional manometry showed that: the preoperative median of the lower esophageal sphincter resting pressure (LESRP) was 9.15 mmHg and 13.2 mmHg postoperatively (p=0.006). The preoperative median of the esophageal contraction amplitude was 47.85 mmHg, and 57.50 mmHg postoperatively (p=0.408). Preoperative evaluation of esophageal peristalsis showed that 13.6% of the sample presented diffuse esophageal spasm and 9.1% ineffective esophageal motility. In the postoperative, 4.5% of patients had diffuse esophageal spasm, 13.6% of aperistalsis and 22.7% of ineffective motor activity (p=0.133).

Herein, metal-free electrochemical advanced oxidation processes (EAOPs) were developed with nitrogen and sulfur co-doped electrochemically exfoliated graphene (N, S-EEGr) electrocatalysts, which was confirmed as an outstanding bifunctional catalyst for synchronous generation and activation of H2O2 via (2 + 1) e- consecutive reduction reactions. Specifically, two elements (N, S) in metal-free N, S-EEGr-CF cathode synergize to promote the formation of H2O2 followed by its activation. With N, S-EEGr-CF cathode, phenol of initial 50 mg L-1 could be effectively removed within pH 3-11 and 6.25 mA cm-2, and 100% removal efficiency could be achieved within 15-min even at neutral pH. The pseudo-first-order rate constant for phenol removal in metal-free EAOPs with N,S-EEGr-CF at neutral pH was 10 times higher than that with EF process. Detection of active species, coupled with decay kinetics with specific trapping agents, confirmed that OH was the dominant oxidizing species promoting removal efficiencies of organics (phenol, antibiotics and dyes) at pH 3 and pH 7. In the actual wastewater treatment, the synergistic effect of bifunctional catalyst would also be used for improving the degradation efficiency of organics. Thus, the metal-free EAOPs with N,S-EEGr-CF cathode may serve as an alternative in wastewater treatment with a broadened range of solution pH values and avoiding Fe2+ (catalyst) addition.","Yang, Weilu; Zhou, Minghua; Mai, Lei; Ou, Huase; Oturan, Nihal; Oturan, Mehmet A; Zeng, Eddy Y",Sci Total Environ,,134

The potential impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on the kidneys is still undetermined, and a variety of lesions are seen in the kidney tissue of coronavirus disease patients. This review is based on the morphological findings of patients described in case reports and a series of published cases. A search was conducted on MEDLINE and PubMed of case reports and case series of lesions in the presence of non-critical infection by SARS-CoV-2 published until 15/09/2020. We highlight the potential of the virus directly influencing the damage or the innate and adaptive immune response activating cytokine and procoagulant cascades, in addition to the genetic component triggering glomerular diseases, mainly collapsing focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, tubulointerstitial, and even vascular diseases. Kidney lesions caused by SARS-CoV-2 are frequent and have an impact on morbidity and mortality; thus, studies are needed to assess the morphological kidney changes and their mechanisms and may help define their spectrum and immediate or long-term impact.","de Oliveira, Patrick; Cunha, Kaile; Neves, Precil; Muniz, Monique; Gatto, Giuseppe; Salgado Filho, Natalino; Guedes, Felipe; Silva, Gyl",Medicina (Kaunas),,134

The limited availability of these test kits makes the testing capacity of a large population very limited. To optimise the use of the available testing capacity, we study two group testing strategies expected to considerably reduce the required number of test kits. For each strategy, two problems are addressed: the minimisation of tests required to investigate a targeted population and the maximisation of the size of the tested population subject to a given testing capacity. We mathematically formulate both problems and provide the optimal pool size formula associated with each strategy. Real and simulated case studies are presented to assess the efficiency of both strategies. We provide evidence that the best strategy to be used during the screening process depends on this pandemic’s prevalence rate. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Zahrouni, W.; Kamoun, H.",Journal of Decision Systems,,134

RECENT FINDINGS: Important causes of unilateral and bilateral tinnitus are discussed, including those that are treatable or caused by serious structural or vascular causes. Concepts of hyperacusis and misophonia are covered, along with various types of neurologic disorders that can lead to pain in the ear. Hearing loss is common but not always purely otologic. SUMMARY: Tinnitus and hearing loss are common symptoms that are sometimes related to a primary neurologic disorder. This review, tailored to neurologists who care for patients who may be referred to or encountered in neurology practice, provides information on hearing disorders, how to recognize when a neurologic process may be involved, and when to refer to otolaryngology or other specialists.","Fife, Terry D; Tourkevich, Roksolyana",Continuum (Minneap Minn),,134

As informações sobre a pandemia são constantes na mídia. Além disso, o distanciamento social foi adotado no Brasil como medida de prevenção da disseminação da COVID-19, o que pode ter consequências econômicas e psicossociais. Nesse contexto, o objetivo deste estudo foi verificar os fatores associados a indicadores de sintomas de transtornos mentais em residentes do Rio Grande do Sul, durante o período inicial da política de distanciamento social decorrente da pandemia da COVID-19. O estudo foi aprovado pelo CONEP. Participaram 799 pessoas, com idades entre 18 e 75 anos (M = 36,56; DP = 12,88), 82,7% mulheres, que responderam um questionário sociodemográfico, de distanciamento social e ao Self-Report Questionnaire (SRQ-20). Os resultados indicaram que ter renda diminuída no período, fazer parte do grupo de risco e estar mais exposto a informações sobre mortos e infectados, são fatores que podem provocar maior prejuízo na saúde mental nesse período pandemia. Investigar determinantes sociais que contribuem para maior vulnerabilidade ao adoecimento mental da população é importante no campo da saúde coletiva para o planejamento de ações e políticas públicas.","Duarte, Michael de Quadros; Santo, Manuela Almeida da Silva; Lima, Carolina Palmeiro; Giordani, Jaqueline Portella; Trentini, Clarissa Marceli",Ciênc.

There are currently no drugs or vaccines with proven efficacy for its prevention and little knowledge was known about the pathogenicity mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Previous studies showed both virus and host-derived MicroRNAs (miRNAs) played crucial roles in the pathology of virus infection. In this study, we use computational approaches to scan the SARS-CoV-2 genome for putative miRNAs and predict the virus miRNA targets on virus and human genome as well as the host miRNAs targets on virus genome. Furthermore, we explore miRNAs involved dysregulation caused by the virus infection. Our results implicated that the immune response and cytoskeleton organization are two of the most notable biological processes regulated by the infection-modulated miRNAs. Impressively, we found hsa-miR-4661-3p was predicted to target the S gene of SARS-CoV-2, and a virus-encoded miRNA MR147-3p could enhance the expression of TMPRSS2 with the function of strengthening SARS-CoV-2 infection in the gut.

Methods We retrospectively reviewed the Ljubljana Maternity Hospital database and searched for pregnant women, who were admitted to the hospital between March 15 and May 16, 2020, for a planned procedure or hospitalization. Their medical records were examined and SARS-CoV-2 test results were retrieved. Results During the two-month period analyzed, there were a total of 265 scheduled admissions of pregnant women to our hospital. Two hundred two (76.2%) were tested for SARS-CoV-2 1 day prior to admission. All tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, regardless of having coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-compatible signs or symptoms (n=28) or not (n=174). Conclusions In a population with a low SARS-CoV-2 burden, usefulness of universal testing of pregnant women before admission to the hospital is limited. We recommend that obstetric units in regions with low SARS-CoV-2 burden enforce rational use of personal protective equipment and diligent screening protocols using targeted questionnaires, whereas SARS-CoV-2 laboratory testing should be performed only in screen-positives: those with high clinical suspicion of COVID-19 and/or suspected epidemiological history.","Sterbenc, Anja; Premru Srsen, Tanja; Lucovnik, Miha; Vidmar Simic, Marijana; Steblovnik, Lili; Fabjan Vodusek, Vesna; Druskovic, Mirjam; Kavsek, Gorazd; Poljak, Mario; Trojner Bregar, Andreja",J. perinat. med,,134

METHODS: Lung US examinations were performed in 63 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to a university hospital. Lung involvement was evaluated on a 4-point scale with a 12-area pulmonary division, obtaining a lung score (LS). Ultrasound findings and clinical characteristics were recorded. RESULTS: All patients showed US involvement in at least 1 area (mean ± SD, 8 ± 3.5). The total LS was 15.3 ± 8.1, without differences between left and right lungs. Most affected regions were the lower region (95.2%) and the posterior region (73.8%). The total LS showed a strong correlation (r = -0.765) with the oxygen pressure-to-fraction of inspired oxygen ratio; by lung region, those with a higher correlation were the LS of the anterior region (r = -0.823) and the LS of the upper region (r = -0.731). In total, 22.2% of patients required noninvasive respiratory support (NIRS). A multivariate analysis showed that the anterior region LS, adjusted for age and sex, was significant (odds ratio, 2.159; 95% confidence interval, 1.309-3.561) for the risk of requiring NIRS. An anterior region LS of 4 or higher and a total LS of 19 or higher had similar characteristics to predict the need for NIRS. CONCLUSIONS: Ultrasound involvement in COVID-19 pneumonia is bilateral and heterogeneous. Most affected regions are the posterior and the lower regions. The anterior region has prognostic value because its involvement strongly correlates with the risk of requiring NIRS, and an anterior region LS of 4 or higher has high sensitivity and specificity for predicting the need for NIRS.","Castelao, Jorge; Graziani, Desirée; Soriano, Joan B; Izquierdo, José Luis",J. ultrasound med,,134

To help develop appropriate public health measures and deploy corresponding resources, many governments have been actively tracking COVID-19 in real time within their jurisdictions. However, one of the key unresolved issues is whether COVID-19 was distributed differently among different age groups and between the two sexes in the ongoing pandemic. The objectives of this study were to use publicly available data to investigate the relative distributions of COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths among age groups and between the sexes throughout 2020;and to analyze temporal changes in the relative frequencies of COVID-19 for each age group and each sex. Fifteen countries reported age group and/or sex data of patients with COVID-19. Our analyses revealed that different age groups and sexes were distributed differently in COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths. However, there were differences among countries in both their age group and sex distributions. Though there was no consistent temporal change across all countries for any age group or either sex in COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths, several countries showed statistically significant patterns. We discuss the potential mechanisms for these observations, the limitations of this study, and the implications of our results on the management of this ongoing pandemic.","Leong, Russell Lee Tin-Suet Joan Chen Zejia Zhang Chelsea Xu Jianping",Infectious Disease Reports,,134
384800,N95 or P2 respirator fit testing policy in Australia: implementation issues to consider,2021,"Purpose: This systematic review aimed to determine currently reported clinical and prodromal ocular symptoms in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods: An online article search was performed in PubMed and EMBASE. Altogether 15 studies (retrospective, prospective, or case studies) involving 1533 patients with COVID-19, reporting on ocular symptoms, and with outcome data available were identified. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses reporting guidelines were followed. Study-specific estimates (incidence rates of ocular symptoms in patients with COVID-19) of cases were combined using one-group meta-analysis in a random-effects model. Results: Of all included studies, 11.2% (95% confidence interval, 5.5-16.9; 78/1526 cases) reported ocular symptoms. The most common ocular finding was conjunctivitis. Prodromal ocular symptoms occurred in 12.5% (13/104 cases) of patients with COVID-19. Positive real-time polymerase chain reaction results were obtained for 16.7% (10/60 cases) of conjunctival samples and 0% (0/17 cases) of tear samples. Twelve ocular conjunctival swab samples tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Ten cases were from subjects showing ocular symptoms (16.7%, 10/60 cases), and the remaining two cases were from subjects without ocular manifestation (1.8%, 2/113 cases). Limitations included the short study period, small sample size, findings were limited to the Asian population, only seven articles included ophthalmologic examination details, and there is currently no consensus on COVID-19 management. Conclusions: Ocular symptoms may occur in the presymptomatic phase as a prodromal symptom (12.5%, 13/104 cases), suggesting the possibility of viral transmission from the conjunctiva.","Inomata, Takenori; Kitazawa, Koji; Kuno, Toshiki; Sung, Jaemyoung; Nakamura, Masahiro; Iwagami, Masao; Takagi, Hisato; Midorikawa-Inomata, Akie; Zhu, Jun; Fujimoto, Keiichi; Okumura, Yuichi; Miura, Maria; Fujio, Kenta; Hirosawa, Kunihiko; Akasaki, Yasutsugu; Kuwahara, Mizu; Dana, Reza; Murakami, Akira",Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci,,134

The lack of a valid, accepted treatment protocol and vaccine that leads to continued treatment searches. Leng et al published their article in the Aging and Disease journal, which demonstrates that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can be used for COVID-19 treatment. Adipose tissue is one of the most important MSCs sources in the body, and adipose derived stromal cells (ADSCs) from adipose tissue are also one of the most valuable components of stromal vascular fraction (SVF). Finally, Gentile and Sterodimas, have also published their article for the potential use of SVF in COVID-19 treatment in Aging and Disease journal. Their publication has been a guide in many ways. Adipose tissue-derived stromal cells have three main features: Immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory and regenerative. Immunomodulator effects are used as a preventive in patients prone to disease; its anti-inflammatory effects may allow them to be used as a therapeutic during active disease period and finally regenerative effects to repair post-disease sequale. Those cells can be obtained not only enzymatically, but also mechanically with very benefits. They can be delivered not only systemically through the IV route but also to the target organ with a carrier. While suggesting any adipose tissue-derived treatment method possibility, the relation of adipose tissue COVID-19 should not be ignored. Because, COVID-19 shows its effect through ACE-2 and adipose tissue is very rich and important tissue in terms of ACE-2.","Copcu, Hasim Eray",Aging Dis,,134
409739,"Morphometric study of gastric mucosa in dogs submitted to proximal gastric vagotomy, splenectomy or proximal gastric vagotomy associated with splenectomy",2002,"In recent years there has been growing interest in measuring time-varying functional connectivity between different brain regions using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data. One way to assess the relationship between signals from different brain regions is to measure their phase synchronization (PS) across time. There are several ways to perform such analyses, and here we compare methods that utilize a PS metric together with a sliding window, referred to here as windowed phase synchronization (WPS), with those that directly measure the instantaneous phase synchronization (IPS). In particular, IPS has recently gained popularity as it offers single time-point resolution of time-resolved fMRI connectivity. In this paper, we discuss the underlying assumptions required for performing PS analyses and emphasize the necessity of band-pass filtering the data to obtain valid results. We review various methods for evaluating PS and introduce a new approach within the IPS framework denoted the cosine of the relative phase (CRP). We contrast methods through a series of simulations and application to rs-fMRI data. Our results indicate that CRP outperforms other tested methods and overcomes issues related to undetected temporal transitions from positive to negative associations common in IPS analysis. Further, in contrast to phase coherence, CRP unfolds the distribution of PS measures, which benefits subsequent clustering of PS matrices into recurring brain states.","Honari, Hamed; Choe, Ann S.; Electrical, Martin A.

The aim of the study was to investigate the relationship between blood groups and the course of COVID-19 in Turkey. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Laboratory confirmed COVID-19 patients aged 18 and over (n=39.850) were randomized in age and gender-matched groups according to blood groups Results: Advanced age, male gender and blood group A were found to be related with increased rate of intensive care unit (ICU) admission (OR =1.089, 95% CI: 1.085-1.093 for age; OR=1.963, 95% CI: 1.737-2.218 for male gender; OR=1.216, 95% CI: 1.023-1.446 for blood group A). When blood group O individuals were compared to non-O individuals, no significant difference was observed regarding the rate of hospital and ICU admission, mechanical ventilation (MV) support, length of hospital and ICU stay, and case fatality rate (CFR). The CFR in patients with blood group A, B, O, and AB were 2.6%, 2.2%, 3.1%, and 2.3%, respectively. There were no significant differences between Rh-negative and positive patients regarding the rate of hospital and ICU admission (p=0.280 and p=0.741, respectively), also the rate of MV support and CFR was similar (p=0.933 and p= 0.417).

We construct an epidemic model, namely SEAIR, and take advantage of the dynamic transmission process depicted by SEAIR to estimate the onset probability in each day of exposed individuals in eight impacted countries. Based on these estimations, the general incubation probability distribution of COVID-19 has been revealed. The proposed method can avoid several biases of traditional survey-based methods. However, due to the mathematical-model-based nature of this method, the inference results are somewhat sensitive to the setting of parameters. Therefore, this method should be practiced reasonably on the basis of a certain understanding of the studied epidemic.","Lai, Shiyang; Zhao, Tianqi; Fan, Ningyuan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.11183v1.pdf,134

We present the clinical outcomes of HIV patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in a matched comparison with historical controls. METHODS: We conducted retrospective cohort study of HIV patients who were admitted for COVID-19 between March 2020 and April 2020 to Newark Beth Israel Medical Center. Data on baseline clinical characteristics and hospital course was documented and compared with that of a matched control group of COVID-19 patients who had no history of HIV. Kaplan Meier Survival curves and the log-rank tests were used to estimate and compare in-hospital survival between both unmatched and matched groups. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients with HIV were hospitalized with COVID-19. Median age was 59 years. The rates of in-hospital death, the need for mechanical ventilation and intensive care unit admission were 13% (n=3), 9% (n=2) and 9% (n=2) respectively. The HIV infection was well controlled in all patients except for 3 patients who had presented with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). All AIDS patients were discharged home uneventfully. A one-to-one propensity matching identified 23 COVID-19 patients who served as a control group. In both pre- and post-match cohorts, survival between HIV and control groups were comparable. CONCLUSIONS: In our cohort of HIV infected patients hospitalized for COVID-19, there was no difference in mortality, ICU admission and the need for mechanical ventilation when compared to a matched control of COVID -19 patients with HIV.

456554,Clinical and epidemiological features of COVID-19 deaths in Nepal,2020,"OBJECTIVE: The aim was to determine the prevalence and risk factors for electrographic seizures and other electroencephalographic (EEG) patterns in patients with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) undergoing clinically indicated continuous electroencephalogram (cEEG) monitoring and to assess whether EEG findings are associated with outcomes. METHODS: We identified 197 patients with COVID-19 referred for cEEG at 9 participating centers. Medical records and EEG reports were reviewed retrospectively to determine the incidence of and clinical risk factors for seizures and other epileptiform patterns. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis assessed the relationship between EEG patterns and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Electrographic seizures were detected in 19 (9.6%) patients, including nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) in 11 (5.6%). Epileptiform abnormalities (either ictal or interictal) were present in 96 (48.7%). Preceding clinical seizures during hospitalization were associated with both electrographic seizures (36.4% in those with vs 8.1% in those without prior clinical seizures, odds ratio [OR] 6.51, p = 0.01) and NCSE (27.3% vs 4.3%, OR 8.34, p = 0.01). A pre-existing intracranial lesion on neuroimaging was associated with NCSE (14.3% vs 3.7%; OR 4.33, p = 0.02). In multivariate analysis of outcomes, electrographic seizures were an independent predictor of in-hospital mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 4.07 [1.44-11.51], p < 0.01). In competing risks analysis, hospital length of stay increased in the presence of NCSE (30 day proportion discharged with vs without NCSE: HR 0.21 [0.03-0.33] vs 0.43 [0.36-0.49]).

456823,Protecting wild animals,2020,"BACKGROUND: Australia has successfully controlled the COVID-19 pandemic. Similar to other high-income countries, Australia has extensively used telehealth services. Virtual health care, including telemedicine in combination with remote patient monitoring, has been implemented in certain settings as part of new models of care that are aimed at managing patients with COVID-19 outside the hospital setting. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to describe the implementation of and early experience with virtual health care for community management of patients with COVID-19. METHODS: This observational cohort study was conducted with patients with COVID-19 who availed of a large Australian metropolitan health service with an established virtual health care program capable of monitoring patients remotely. We included patients with COVID-19 who received the health service, could self-isolate safely, did not require immediate admission to an in-patient setting, had no major active comorbid illness, and could be managed at home or at other suitable sites. Skin temperature, pulse rate, and blood oxygen saturation were remotely monitored. The primary outcome measures were care escalation rates, including emergency department presentation, and hospital admission. RESULTS: During March 11-29, 2020, a total of 162 of 173 (93.6%) patients with COVID-19 (median age 38 years, range 11-79 years), who were diagnosed locally, were enrolled in the virtual health care program. For 62 of 162 (38.3%) patients discharged during this period, the median length of stay was 8 (range 1-17) days. The peak of 100 prevalent patients equated to approximately 25 patients per registered nurse per shift. Patients were contacted a median of 16 (range 1-30) times during this period. Video consultations (n=1902, 66.3%) comprised most of the patient contacts, and 132 (81.5%) patients were monitored remotely. Care escalation rates were low, with an ambulance attendance rate of 3% (n=5), emergency department attendance rate of 2.5% (n=4), and hospital admission rate of 1.9% (n=3). No deaths were recorded. CONCLUSIONS: Community-based virtual health care is safe for managing most patients with COVID-19 and can be rapidly implemented in an urban Australian setting for pandemic management. Health services implementing virtual health care should anticipate challenges associated with rapid technology deployments and provide adequate support to resolve them, including strategies to support the use of health information technologies among consumers.","Hutchings, Owen Rhys; Dearing, Cassandra; Jagers, Dianna; Shaw, Miranda Jane; Raffan, Freya; Jones, Aaron; Taggart, Richard; Sinclair, Tim; Anderson, Teresa; Ritchie, Angus Graham",J Med Internet Res,,134

Isolated day-case units have been recommended as 'COVID-cold' operating sites to resume surgical procedures. This study aims to identify patients suitable for day case laparoscopic cholecystectomy (DCLC) at isolated units by investigating patient factors and unexpected admission. METHOD: Retrospective analysis of 327 patients undergoing DCLC between January and December 2018 at Ysbyty Gwynedd (District General Hospital; YG) and Llandudno General Hospital (isolated unit; LLGH), North Wales, UK. RESULTS: The results showed that 100% of DCLCs in LLGH were successful; 71.4% of elective DCLCs were successful at YG. Increasing age (p = 0.004), BMI (p = 0.01), ASA Score (p = 0.006), previous ERCP (p = 0.05), imaging suggesting cholecystitis (p = 0.003) and thick-walled gallbladder (p = 0.04) were significantly associated with failed DCLC on univariate analysis. Factors retaining significance (OR, 95% CI) after multiple regression include BMI (1.82, 1.05-3.16; p = 0.034), imaging suggesting cholecystitis (4.42, 1.72-11.38; p = 0.002) and previous ERCP (5.25, 1.53-18.00; p = 0.008). Postoperative complications are comparable in BMI <35kg/m2 and 35-39.9kg/m2. CONCLUSIONS: Current patient selection for isolated day unit is effective in ensuring safe discharge and could be further developed with greater consideration for patients with BMI 35-39.9kg/m2.

However, there are limited data evaluating the scope of these influences on COVID-19 response. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare handwashing and social distancing practices in different countries and evaluate practice predictors using the health belief model (HBM). METHODS: From April 11 to May 1, 2020, we conducted an online, cross-sectional survey disseminated internationally via social media. Participants were adults aged 18 years or older from four different countries: the United States, Mexico, Hong Kong (China), and Taiwan. Primary outcomes were self-reported handwashing and social distancing practices during COVID-19. Predictors included constructs of the HBM: perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, perceived benefits, perceived barriers, self-efficacy, and cues to action. Associations of these constructs with behavioral outcomes were assessed by multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: We analyzed a total of 71,851 participants, with 3070 from the United States, 3946 from Mexico, 1201 from Hong Kong (China), and 63,634 from Taiwan. Of these countries, respondents from the United States adhered to the most social distancing practices (&#967;23=2169.7, P<.001), while respondents from Taiwan performed the most handwashing (&#967;23=309.8, P<.001). Multivariable logistic regression analyses indicated that self-efficacy was a positive predictor for handwashing (odds ratio [OR]United States 1.58, 95% CI 1.21-2.07; ORMexico 1.5, 95% CI 1.21-1.96; ORHong Kong 2.48, 95% CI 1.80-3.44; ORTaiwan 2.30, 95% CI 2.21-2.39) and social distancing practices (ORUnited States 1.77, 95% CI 1.24-2.49; ORMexico 1.77, 95% CI 1.40-2.25; ORHong Kong 3.25, 95% CI 2.32-4.62; ORTaiwan 2.58, 95% CI 2.47-2.68) in all countries. Handwashing was positively associated with perceived susceptibility in Mexico, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, while social distancing was positively associated with perceived severity in the United States, Mexico, and Taiwan. CONCLUSIONS: Social media recruitment strategies can be used to reach a large audience during a pandemic. Self-efficacy was the strongest predictor for handwashing and social distancing. Policies that address relevant health beliefs can facilitate adoption of necessary actions for preventing COVID-19. Our findings may be explained by the timing of government policies, the number of cases reported in each country, individual beliefs, and cultural context.","Hsing, Julianna C; Ma, Jasmin; Barrero-Castillero, Alejandra; Jani, Shilpa G; Pulendran, Uma Palam; Lin, Bea-Jane; Thomas-Uribe, Monika; Wang, C Jason",J Med Internet Res,,134

To protect against PEDV invasion, a mucosal vaccine is utilized effectively. In this study, we generated a recombinant adenovirus vaccine encoding the heat-labile enterotoxin B (LTB) and the core neutralizing epitope (COE) of PEDV (rAd-LTB-COE). The fusion protein LTB-COE was successfully expressed by the recombinant adenovirus in HEK293 cells, and the immunogenicity of the vaccine candidate was assessed in BALB/c mice and piglets. Three intramuscular or oral vaccinations with rAd-LTB-COE at two-week intervals induced robust humoral and mucosal immune responses. Moreover, a cell-mediated immune response was promoted in immunized mice, and the neutralizing antibody inhibited both the vaccine strain and the emerging PEDV isolate. Immunization experiments in piglets revealed that rAd-LTB-COE was immunogenic and induced good immune responses in piglets. Further studies are required to evaluate the efficacy of rAd-LTB-COE against a highly virulent PEDV challenge.","Do, Van Tan; Jang, Jisung; Park, Jeongho; Dao, Hoai Thu; Kim, Kiju; Hahn, Tae-Wook",Arch Virol,,134

509864,"Experiences and lessons learned from two virtual, hands-on microbiome bioinformatics workshops",2021,"BACKGROUND: Secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH) is a life-threatening hyperinflammatory event and a fatal complication of viral infections. Whether sHLH may also be observed in patients with a cytokine storm induced by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is still uncertain. We aimed to determine the incidence of sHLH in severe COVID-19 patients and evaluate the underlying risk factors. METHOD: Four hundred fifteen severe COVID-19 adult patients were retrospectively assessed for hemophagocytosis score (HScore). A subset of 7 patients were unable to be conclusively scored due to insufficient patient data. RESULTS: In 408 patients, 41 (10.04%) had an HScore &gt;=169 and were characterized as ""suspected sHLH positive"". Compared with patients below a HScore threshold of 98, the suspected sHLH positive group had higher D-dimer, total bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, triglycerides, ferritin, interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase isoenzyme, troponin, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, while leukocyte, hemoglobin, platelets, lymphocyte, fibrinogen, pre-albumin, albumin levels were significantly lower (all P &lt; 0.05). Multivariable logistic regression revealed that high ferritin (&gt;1922.58 ng/mL), low platelets (&lt;101 x 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;/L) and high triglycerides (&gt;2.28 mmol/L) were independent risk factors for suspected sHLH in COVID-19 patients. Importantly, COVID-19 patients that were suspected sHLH positive had significantly more multi-organ failure. Additionally, a high HScore (&gt;98) was an independent predictor for mortality in COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: HScore should be measured as a prognostic biomarker in COVID-19 patients. In particular, it is important that HScore is assessed in patients with high ferritin, triglycerides and low platelets to improve the detection of suspected sHLH.","Meng, M.; Chen, L.; Zhang, S.; Dong, X.; Li, W.; Li, R.; Deng, Y.; Wang, T.; Xu, Y.; Liu, J.; Huang, Y.; Chen, Y.; Huang, S.; Wen, Z.; Zhang, L.; Du, H.; Liu, Y.; Annane, D.; Qu, J.; Chen, D.",BMC Infectious Diseases,,134

592241,Reply to GASTRO-D-20-01116,2020-09-22,"Otitis media (OM) or middle ear inflammation is a spectrum of diseases, including acute otitis media (AOM), otitis media with effusion (OME; ‘glue ear’) and chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM). OM is among the most common diseases in young children worldwide. Although OM may resolve spontaneously without complications, it can be associated with hearing loss and life-long sequelae. In developing countries, CSOM is a leading cause of hearing loss. OM can be of bacterial or viral origin; during ‘colds’, viruses can ascend through the Eustachian tube to the middle ear and pave the way for bacterial otopathogens that reside in the nasopharynx. Diagnosis depends on typical signs and symptoms, such as acute ear pain and bulging of the tympanic membrane (eardrum) for AOM and hearing loss for OME; diagnostic modalities include (pneumatic) otoscopy, tympanometry and audiometry. Symptomatic management of ear pain and fever is the mainstay of AOM treatment, reserving antibiotics for children with severe, persistent or recurrent infections. Management of OME largely consists of watchful waiting, with ventilation (tympanostomy) tubes primarily for children with chronic effusions and hearing loss, developmental delays or learning difficulties. The role of hearing aids to alleviate symptoms of hearing loss in the management of OME needs further study. Insertion of ventilation tubes and adenoidectomy are common operations for recurrent AOM to prevent recurrences, but their effectiveness is still debated. Despite reports of a decline in the incidence of OM over the past decade, attributed to the implementation of clinical guidelines that promote accurate diagnosis and judicious use of antibiotics and to pneumococcal conjugate vaccination, OM continues to be a leading cause for medical consultation, antibiotic prescription and surgery in high-income countries.

Eighteen 3-week old colostrum-fed Jersey calves were completely randomized to 1 of 6 doses of E. coli O111:H8. The challenge doses included 0, 1.5 × 10(5), 1.5 × 10(6), 1.5 × 10(7), 1.5 × 10(8), and 1.5 × 10(9) colony-forming units (CFU) given intravenously as a bolus in 5 mL of sterile isotonic saline. Peripheral blood samples were collected at 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, and 48 h relative to the challenge for biochemical, total leukocyte count, and differential analyses. Rectal temperatures were collected via indwelling rectal temperature probes at 5-min intervals, and hourly averages calculated from 2 d prior to the challenge till 2 d after the challenge. All calves survived the 48 h observation period following the challenge. Calves given 1.5 × 10(8) and 1.5 × 10(9) CFU displayed sickness behaviors (P < 0.01) beginning 0.5 h after the challenge and returned to that of the control calves by 6 and 32 h for calves challenged with 1.5 × 10(8) and 1.5 × 10(9) CFU, respectively. There were treatment × time interactions (P < 0.01) on total leukocyte counts and plasma glucose and zinc concentrations. Calves administered 1.5 × 10(8) and 1.5 × 10(9) CFU had leucopenia beginning 2 h after the challenge and returning to counts similar to the control calves within 24 h. Additionally, those calves were hypoglycemic from 4 to 12 h after the challenge with the degree of hypoglycemia inversely related to the dose of the E. coli. All calves challenged with E. coli had decreased plasma zinc concentrations, and the magnitude was inversely proportional to the challenge dose. There were treatment × time interactions (P < 0.001) on rectal temperatures following the challenge. All calves challenged with E. coli developed a febrile response, but the intensity and duration of the response were dependent on the challenge dose. These data indicate that calves intravenously challenged with 1.5 × 10(8) and 1.5 × 10(9) CFU of the E. coli O111:H8 showed immediate clinical and biochemical signs indicative of septicemia. However, calves administered 1.5 × 10(7) or less of the E. coli had febrile responses, but did not develop septicemia. Blood glucose and zinc concentrations may be dose responsive indicators that could potentially differentiate between a septicemic versus non-septicemic calf.","Ballou, M.A.; Cobb, C.J.; Hulbert, L.E.; Carroll, J.A.",Vet Immunol Immunopathol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21420179/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2011.02.008; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165242711000511; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165242711000511,134

Demographic data, symptoms, comorbidities, and laboratory parameters were recorded at the time of admission. Days to nucleic acid conversion and days of hospitalization were defined as clinical outcomes for evaluating the clinical relevance of serum KL-6 levels in COVID-19. Patients with elevated KL-6 levels were significantly older; had more reported instances of fever, cough, fatigue, and wheezing; and a longer hospital stays than those with normal KL-6 levels; the difference was statistically significant (p<0.001). Furthermore, KL-6 levels was associated with the days of hospitalization and various laboratory parameters that influence the severity and prognosis of COVID-19. Elevated KL-6 levels have also been shown to be an independent risk factor for prolonged hospitalization. Our data suggest that serum KL-6 levels on admission can serve as an indicator for assessing the clinical outcomes of COVID-19.","Chen, Hao; Qin, Rundong; Huang, Zhifeng; Luo, Wenting; Zheng, Peiyan; Huang, Huimin; Hu, Haisheng; Wang, Hui; Sun, Baoqing",Cytokine,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1043466621000934; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cyto.2021.155513; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043466621000934?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34507246/,134

METHODS: All members of the BSCI/BSCCT were invited to submit research questions that they considered to be of the highest clinical and/or academic priority in the field of cardiovascular imaging (phase 1). Subsequently a steering committee removed duplicate questions and combined questions of a similar theme by consensus agreement where appropriate. BSCI/BSCCT members were invited to rank the resulting research questions in two further iterative rounds (phases 2 and 3) to determine a final list of high-priority research questions. RESULTS: A total of 111 research questions were submitted in phase 1 by 30 BSCI/BSCCT members. While there was a broad range of topics, from determining the optimal features/markers of the vulnerable plaque to investigating how cardiac imaging can best be used to maximise clinical outcomes and economic costs, multimodality imaging-related (n=44, 40%) questions dominated the categories and coronary artery imaging (n=40, 36%) was the most common topic. Over two iterative rounds of prioritisation of these research questions, the original 111 were reduced to 75 questions in round 2, and 25 in round 3. From these 25 a final Top 10 list was distilled by consensus grouping. CONCLUSION: This study has identified and ranked the top research priorities in cardiovascular imaging, as identified by the BSCI/BSCCT membership.

The cost-shifting narrative and the empirical strategies used to evaluate it typically assume no connection between public prices and the number of hospitals operating in the market (market structure). We raise the possibility of ""consolidation-induced cost shifting,"" which recognizes that changes in public prices for hospital care can affect market structure and, through that mechanism, affect commercial prices. We investigated the first leg of that argument: that public payment may affect hospital market structure. After controlling for many confounders, we found that hospitals with a higher share of Medicare patients had lower and more rapidly declining profits and an increased likelihood of closure or acquisition compared with hospitals that were less reliant on Medicare. This is consistent with the existence of consolidation-induced cost shifting and implies that reductions in public prices must be undertaken cautiously. Mechanisms to limit closure- or acquisition-induced increases in commercial hospital prices may be important.","Chernew, Michael E; He, Hongyi; Mintz, Harrison; Beaulieu, Nancy",Health affairs,https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.2021.00201; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34339245/,134

Skin-picking development has been suggested to be preceded by traumatic life events. Dissociative symptoms have been reported as experienced by skin-picking sufferers during picking episodes. The purpose of the study was to examine whether the link between trauma and automatic type of skin-picking is mediated by the frequency of dissociative experiences, and whether the COVID-19 pandemic conditions have changed this relationship in any way. Methods: The study sample consisted of 594 adults (76% women) aged from 18 to 60. Traumatic life events, dissociative experiences, and types of skin-picking (focused vs. automatic) were assessed with self-report questionnaires. Mediation analyses and multigroup path analyses were carried out. Results: Dissociative experiences partially mediated the link between traumatic events and both types of skin-picking. The model was robust considering the conditions in which survey was filled out (pre-pandemic vs. pandemic).

Simulation results show that if there is no specific medicine for it, it will form a global pandemic. Taiwan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Japan, Thailand, and the United States are the most vulnerable. The relationship between each country's vulnerability and days before the first imported case occurred shows an exponential decrease. We successfully predicted the outbreak of South Korea, Japan, and Italy in the early stages of the global pandemic based on the information before February 12, 2020.

The role of neutralizing antibody (NAb) response in disease progression remains elusive. This study determined the seroprevalence of 733 non-COVID-19 individuals from April 2018 to February 2020 in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and compared the neutralizing antibody (NAb) responses of eight COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with those of 42 patients not admitted to the ICU. We found that NAb against SARS-CoV-2 was not detectable in any of the anonymous serum specimens from the 733 non-COVID-19 individuals. The peak serum geometric mean NAb titer was significantly higher among the eight ICU patients than the 42 non-ICU patients (7280 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1468-36099]) vs (671 [95% CI, 368-1223]). Furthermore, NAb titer increased significantly at earlier infection stages among ICU patients than among non-ICU patients. The median number of days to reach the peak Nab titers after symptoms onset was shorter among the ICU patients (17.6) than that of the non-ICU patients (20.1). Multivariate analysis showed that oxygen requirement and fever during admission were the only clinical factors independently associated with higher NAb titers. Our data suggested that SARS-CoV-2 was unlikely to have silently spread before the COVID-19 emergence in Hong Kong. ICU patients had an accelerated and augmented NAb response compared to non-ICU patients, which was associated with disease severity.

This study aimed to investigate whether the shape memory bolus can be applied to radiotherapy as a bolus that conformally adheres to the body surface, can be created in a short time, and can be reused. METHODS: The shape memory bolus was developed by cross‐linking tetrabranch PCL with reactive acrylate end groups. Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) was used to evaluate shape memory characterization before deformation and after restoration. In addition, the degree of adhesion to the body surface and crystallization time were calculated. Moreover, dosimetric characterization was evaluated using the water equivalent phantom and an Alderson RANDO phantom. RESULTS: The DSC value between before deformation and after restoration was close to 1. The degree of adhesion of the shape memory bolus (1.9%) was improved compared with the conventional bolus (45.6%) and was equivalent to three‐dimensional (3D) printer boluses (1.3%–3.5%). The crystallization time was approximately 1.5 min, which was clinically acceptable. The dose calculation accuracy, dose distribution, and dose index were the equivalent compared with 3D boluses. CONCLUSION: The shape memory bolus has excellent adhesion to the body surface, can be created in a short time, and can be reused. In addition, the shape memory bolus needs can be made from low‐cost materials and no quality control systems are required for individual clinical departments, and it is useful as a bolus for radiotherapy.","Aoyama, Takahiro; Uto, Koichiro; Shimizu, Hidetoshi; Ebara, Mitsuhiro; Kitagawa, Tomoki; Tachibana, Hiroyuki; Suzuki, Kojiro; Kodaira, Takeshi",Med Phys,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33012062/; https://doi.org/10.1002/mp.14516,134

Methods A cross-sectional survey of masks and other preventive behaviours in adults ≥18 years was conducted in five cities (Sydney, Melbourne, London, Phoenix and New York). Data was analysed according to the epidemiology of COVID-19, mask mandates and a range of predictors of mask wearing. Results The most common measures used were avoiding public areas (80.4%), hand hygiene (76.4%), masks (71.8%) and distancing (67.6%). Over 40% of people avoided medical facilities. These measures decreased from March-July 2020. Pandemic fatigue was associated with younger age, low perceived severity of COVID-19 and declining COVID-19 prevalence. Predictors of mask wearing were location (US, UK), mandates, age <50 years, education, having symptoms and knowing someone with COVID-19. Negative experiences with mask wearing and low perceived severity of COVID-19 reduced mask wearing. Most respondents (98%) believed that hand washing and distancing were necessary, and 80% reported no change or stricter adherence to these measures when wearing masks. Conclusion Pandemic mitigation measures were widely reported across all cities, but decreased between March and July 2020. Pandemic fatigue was more common in younger people. Cities with mandates had higher rates of mask wearing. Promotion of mask use for older people may be useful. Masks did not result in reduction of other hygiene measures.","MacIntyre, C.

Qualitative synthesis and meta-analysis were conducted using the clinical and laboratory data, and random-effects models were applied to estimate pooled results. A total of 61 studies were included (59,254 patients). The most common disease-related symptoms were fever (82%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 56%–99%; n = 4410), cough (61%, 95% CI 39%–81%; n = 3985), muscle aches and/or fatigue (36%, 95% CI 18%–55%; n = 3778), dyspnea (26%, 95% CI 12%–41%; n = 3700), headache in 12% (95% CI 4%–23%, n = 3598 patients), sore throat in 10% (95% CI 5%–17%, n = 1387) and gastrointestinal symptoms in 9% (95% CI 3%–17%, n = 1744). Laboratory findings were described in a lower number of patients and revealed lymphopenia (0.93 × 10(9)/L, 95% CI 0.83–1.03 × 10(9)/L, n = 464) and abnormal C-reactive protein (33.72 mg/dL, 95% CI 21.54–45.91 mg/dL; n = 1637). Radiological findings varied, but mostly described ground-glass opacities and consolidation. Data on treatment options were limited. All-cause mortality was 0.3% (95% CI 0.0%–1.0%; n = 53,631). Epidemiological studies showed that mortality was higher in males and elderly patients. The majority of reported clinical symptoms and laboratory findings related to SARS-CoV-2 infection are non-specific. Clinical suspicion, accompanied by a relevant epidemiological history, should be followed by early imaging and virological assay.","Borges do Nascimento, Israel Júnior; Cacic, Nensi; Abdulazeem, Hebatullah Mohamed; von Groote, Thilo Caspar; Jayarajah, Umesh; Weerasekara, Ishanka; Esfahani, Meisam Abdar; Civile, Vinicius Tassoni; Marusic, Ana; Jeroncic, Ana; Carvas Junior, Nelson; Pericic, Tina Poklepovic; Zakarija-Grkovic, Irena; Meirelles Guimarães, Silvana Mangeon; Luigi Bragazzi, Nicola; Bjorklund, Maria; Sofi-Mahmudi, Ahmad; Altujjar, Mohammad; Tian, Maoyi; Arcani, Diana Maria Cespedes; O’Mathúna, Dónal P.; Marcolino, Milena Soriano",J Clin Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32235486/; https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm9040941,134

Within this context of uncertainty («viral modernity»), flexible education is an option to promote a more just, equitable, accessible and creative educational system. In order to properly interpret the effects of this unique educational circumstance, it is essential to study the previous situation in terms of the use of digital technologies in teaching practices. The objective of the study is to describe the educational integration of ICT and the teacher education model to obtain evidence that contributes to understanding the phenomenon. To this end, a questionnaire consisting of two self-reporting tools and a scale on the description of teaching practice with ICT was applied. The sample is made up of teachers from public primary and secondary schools (N = 251). Data collection was carried out in the months prior to the closure of schools due to the Covid-19 pandemic. A univariate analysis of the variables and contrast tests of non-parametric hypotheses was carried out, along with calculation of the reliability and construction validity of the measuring instruments. The results reveal the most frequent types of teaching practice with ICT and the spaces where digital technologies are commonly used. Various weaknesses can be identified in digital competence among teachers, as well as in the initial/continuing training model, which contribute to the understanding of the difficulties encountered during ""emergency remote education"". Participation in ICT didactic innovation projects and the performance of ICT Coordination are associated with more experiential training. Flexible education requires a redefinition of the teacher training model that encourages learning anywhere, anytime.","Valverde-Berrocoso, Jesús; Fernández-Sánchez, María Rosa; Revuelta Dominguez, Francisco Ignacio; Sosa-Díaz, María José",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0256283; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34411161/,134

Typically, diagnostics are delivered at various tiers of the laboratory network based on population needs, and resource and infrastructure constraints. A diagnostic network additionally incorporates screening and includes point-of-care testing that may occur outside of a laboratory in the community and clinic settings; it also emphasizes the importance of supportive network elements, including specimen referral systems, as being critical for the functioning of the diagnostic network. To date, design and planning of diagnostic networks in LMICs has largely been driven by infectious diseases such as TB and HIV, relying on manual methods and expert consensus, with a limited application of data analytics. Recently, there have been efforts to improve diagnostic network planning, including diagnostic network optimization (DNO). The DNO process involves the collection, mapping, and spatial analysis of baseline data; selection and development of scenarios to model and optimize; and lastly, implementing changes and measuring impact. This review outlines the goals of DNO and steps in the process, and provides clarity on commonly used terms.","Nichols, Kameko; Girdwood, Sarah J.; Inglis, Andrew; Ondoa, Pascale; Sy, Karla Therese L.; Benade, Mariet; Tusiime, Aloysius Bingi; Kao, Kekeletso; Carmona, Sergio; Albert, Heidi; Nichols, Brooke E.",Diagnostics (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/diagnostics11010022; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33374315/,134

For this purpose, mushrooms were irradiated with UV-B and UV-C lamps from their caps, stems, both caps and stems (oblique), and sliced surface at doses of 12.5 kJ m(-2) and 3.6 kJ m(-2), respectively. Then, they were treated by UV-B at 27 °C, 35 °C, and 43 °C. In the next steps, samples were placed in 30 cm and 50 cm distances from the UV source. Afterward, they were irradiated from 15-120 min at an intensity of 3.5 W m(-2). In the stability tests, samples were stored at 25°C, frozen, refrigerated and were cooked and their vitamin D2 content was re-analyzed using HPLC. All experiments were repeated three times. In the sliced group treated with UV-B, vitamin D2 content 14.43 μg gr(-1) was significantly higher than other groups. The internal temperature of 27 °C was found as optimum temperature with the production of 3.81 μg gr(-1) vitamin D. It was revealed that increasing the distance from the UV source had a significant effect on vitamin D production. After 90 min of exposure, the highest amount of vitamin D2 was produced. Data showed that the vitamin D2 content remained almost stable after one day at 25 °C and during the cooking but it decreased about 50% after 7 days of cold storage. The optimal method observed in this study incorporates the use of UV-B lamps, incensement of radiation area in mushrooms and distance reduction from the UV source within 30 cm. the internal temperature of 27 °C should be considered as well in the experiment.","Sarina, Salemi; Ahmad, Saedisomeolia; Fateme, Azimi; Sareh, Zolfigol; Ezeddin, Mohajerani; Mehrdad, Mohammadi; Mehdi, Yaseri",Lebensm Wiss Technol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0023643820313906; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0023643820313906?v=s5,134
637483,The Impact of Simulation on Clinical Outcomes and Surgical Performance By Obstetric and Gynecology Trainees: A Systematic Review,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: Recent studies have shown that obesity is associated with the severity of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). We reviewed clinical studies to clarify the obesity relationship with COVID-19 severity, comorbidities, and discussing possible mechanisms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The electronic databases, including Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar, were searched and all studies conducted on COVID-19 and obesity were reviewed. All studies were independently screened by reviewers based on their titles and abstracts. RESULTS: Forty relevant articles were selected, and their full texts were reviewed. Obesity affects the respiratory and immune systems through various mechanisms. Cytokine and adipokine secretion from adipose tissue leads to a pro-inflammatory state in obese patients, predisposing them to thrombosis, incoordination of innate and adaptive immune responses, inadequate antibody response, and cytokine storm. Obese patients had a longer virus shedding. Obesity is associated with other comorbidities such as hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, and vitamin D deficiency. Hospitalization, intensive care unit admission, mechanical ventilation, and even mortality in obese patients were higher than normal-weight patients. Obesity could alter the direction of severe COVID-19 symptoms to younger individuals. Reduced physical activity, unhealthy eating habits and, more stress and fear experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic may result in more weight gain and obesity. CONCLUSIONS: Obesity should be considered as an independent risk factor for the severity of COVID-19. Paying more attention to preventing weight gain in obese patients with COVID-19 infection in early levels of disease is crucial during this pandemic.","Aghili, Seyed Morsal Mosallami; Ebrahimpur, Mahbube; Arjmand, Babak; Shadman, Zhaleh; Pejman Sani, Mahnaz; Qorbani, Mostafa; Larijani, Bagher; Payab, Moloud",Int J Obes (Lond),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33637951/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41366-021-00776-8,134

The model naturally captures the phase transitions of the epidemic growth rate via change-points and further enjoys great interpretability due to its semiparametric nature. On the methodological front, we advance the nascent self-normalization (SN) technique (Shao, 2010) to testing and estimation of a single change-point in the linear trend of a nonstationary time series. We further combine the SN-based change-point test with the NOT algorithm (Baranowski et al., 2019) to achieve multiple change-point estimation. Using the proposed method, we analyze the trajectory of the cumulative COVID-19 cases and deaths for 30 major countries and discover interesting patterns with potentially relevant implications for effectiveness of the pandemic responses by different countries. Furthermore, based on the change-point detection algorithm and a flexible extrapolation function, we design a simple two-stage forecasting scheme for COVID-19 and demonstrate its promising performance in predicting cumulative deaths in the U.S.","Jiang, Feiyu; Zhao, Zifeng; Shao, Xiaofeng",J Econom,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407620302633?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0304407620302633; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jeconom.2020.07.039; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32836681/,134

Whole blood samples were collected before the start of therapeutic treatment using all virus spread containment measures. Sample preparation protocols were designed in order to minimize operators direct specimen's manipulation. On univariate analysis, circulating levels of CRP were strongly and inversely related to CD3+ (rho = −0.77, p < 0.001), CD3+4+ (rho = −0.74, p < 0.001), and CD3+8+ (rho = −0.66, p = 0.001) implying that the shared variances between absolute values T cells and CRP ranged from 44 to 59%. Of note, the strength of these associations was higher in patients with relatively lower (below the median value) white blood cells (WBC) as compared to those with WBC above the median value.

Results show that the past pandemics have moderately increased income inequality in the affected countries in the period of four to five years after the pandemic's start. On the other hand, we do not find any robust negative impacts on wealth inequality. The results concerning gender inequality are less consistent, but we find some evidence of declining gender equality among the hardest hit countries.

To curb the spread of COVID-19, efficacious vaccination is emerging as essential in mitigating the disease and preventing deaths. Health care workers (HCW) are one of the first groups to receive vaccinations, so it is important to consider their attitudes to COVID-19 vaccination to better address barriers to widespread vaccination acceptance. This study aimed to evaluate variables that are linked with the recommendation of vaccines and intention to take-up vaccination against COVID-19 among the HCWs, in the context of the current pandemic. The study was conducted during the first week of the vaccination campaign dedicated to Italian HCWs, beginning in December 2020, and it involved all doctors in a public hospital in Sicily. The following questionnaires were administered: (1) The perceived vaccine trust questionnaire, measuring the degree of trust in vaccines by healthcare professionals both in general and for the protection of healthcare professionals themselves and patients; (2) the positive and negative affect scale-state (PANAS), for assessing positive and negative emotions in relation to their work as “frontline care providers”; (3) The locus of control of behaviour (LCB) to measure the extent to which subjects perceive responsibility for their personal behaviour (internal vs. external); (4) recommendation vaccines item, referring to the intention to recommend vaccination. The findings suggest that socio-demographic control variables (age, gender, and seniority) showed little or no predictive power in vaccine recommendation, while vaccine confidence, positive emotions, and internal locus of control were excellent predictors of vaccine recommendations by doctors. Younger doctors, both in age and experience, are more confident in vaccines and recommend them more frequently. It is essential to improve institutional communication addressed to doctors to enhance their role as vaccination facilitators.","Rapisarda, Venerando; Vella, Francesca; Ledda, Caterina; Barattucci, Massimiliano; Ramaci, Tiziana",Vaccines (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34205935/; https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9060578,134

One adaption of new ways of working are coworking spaces. They are shared working environments that offer office space and intangible resources, such as knowledge sharing, collaboration and networking. Access to flexible office space for self-employed, start-ups, and corporates is a key resource for businesses. Covid-19 has shown that space provision is becoming more flexible and ventures increasingly use scalable space instead of long-term lease agreements for office space or than owning it. Deskmag counts 18,700 coworking spaces worldwide in the year of 2018 with 1.65 million coworkers and high future growth expectations after COVID-19 [1]. Data were collected through two sources. Data about coworking spaces were collected through a web scraper crawling for coworking spaces within a city as of December 31, 2018. Those data were manually enriched by real estate and economic variables, such as the office high prime rent and office market size. Data about the funding and founding of ventures were obtained through using the database Crunchbase, including all start-ups in a city with their type of funding (including: seed, venture capital, private equity, debt convertibles and others) and their financing rounds. The Crunchbase database lists mostly young firms, commonly called start-ups and small medium enterprises (SME), and their financing with external funding. It includes firms that have needed or might need funding in the near future, or have already got funding. Hence, it is possible to relate spatial clusters with entrepreneurial activity and analyze for example the influence of (flexible) office markets on founding activity. This dataset enables researchers and practitioners to further explore important questions regarding the nexus between the real estate industry, entrepreneurship behavior, start-ups and regional clusters. Due to the scarcity of publicly available quality flexible office space market data, the dataset detailed in this article may play a relevant role to be ready to be used by researchers and practitioners.

This study presents the measures adopted by our institute with the aim of providing information that could be useful to other academic centers promoting clinical trials during the pandemic. MAIN TEXT: After an in-depth analysis of European and Italian guidelines and consultation and analysis of publications regarding the actions implemented by international no profit clinical trial promoters during the emergency, we monitored the way in which the institute managed clinical trials, verifying compliance with regulatory guidelines and clinical procedures, and evaluating screening and recruitment trends in studies. During the pandemic, our center activated a new clinical trial for the treatment of patients with COVID-19. A number of procedural changes in clinical trials were also authorized through notified amendments, in accordance with Italian Medicines Agency (AIFA) guidelines. Patient screening and enrolment was not interrupted in any site participating in multicenter interventional clinical trials on drugs. The institute provided clear indications about essential procedures to be followed, identifying those that could be postponed or carried out by telephone/teleconference. All external sites were monitored remotely, avoiding on-site visits. Although home-working was encouraged, the presence of staff in the central office was also guaranteed to ensure the continuity of promoter activities. CONCLUSIONS: Some measures adopted by IRST could also be effective outside of the COVID-19 period, e.g. numerous activities relating to clinical trial management could be performed on a home-working basis, using suitable digital technologies. In the future, electronic medical records and shared guidelines will be essential for the correct identification and management of trial risks, including the protection of the rights and privacy of subjects taking part. Promoter supervision could be increased by implementing centralized monitoring tools to guarantee data quality. Closer collaboration between promoters and local study staff is needed to optimize trial management.

To our knowledge, no study has evaluated the accuracy of COVID-19 symptom checkers in a statistically rigorous manner. Methods In this paper, we evaluate 10 different COVID-19 symptom checkers screening 50 COVID-19 case reports alongside 410 non-COVID-19 control cases. Results We find that the number of correctly assessed cases varies considerably between different symptom checkers, with Symptoma (F1=0.92, MCC=0.85) showing the overall best performance followed by Infermedica (F1=0.80, MCC=0.61).","Munsch, N.; Martin, A.; Gruarin, S.; Nateqi, J.; Abdarahmane, I.; Weingartner-Ortner, R.; Knapp, B.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.22.20109777v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.22.20109777,134
