174086,"Comparison of Plaque Size, Thermal Stability, and Replication Rate among SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Concern",2021-10-01,"This study investigates how youth from two cities in the United States engage in critical data practices as they learn about and take action in their lives and communities in relation to COVID-19 and its intersections with justice-related concerns. Guided by theories of critical data literacies and data justice, a historicized and future-oriented participatory methodological approach is used to center the lived lives and communities of participants through dialogic interviews and experience sampling method. Data were co-analyzed with participants using critical grounded theory. Findings illustrate how youth not only aimed to reveal the dynamic and human aspects of and relationships with data as they engage with/in the world as people who matter but also offered alternative infrastructures for counter data production and aggregation toward justice in the here and now and desired possible futures. Implications for studies of learning with/through data practices in everyday life in relation to issues of justice are discussed.","Barton, A.

384978,Reply to comments on: Unexpected detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the prepandemic period in Italy,2021,"Given concerns about mental health during periods of Covid-19 lockdown, it important to understand how engagement with online Covid-19 related material can affect mood. In the UK and Ireland, online community support initiatives (OCSIs) have emerged to help people manage their lives. Yet, little is known about how people engaged with these or whether they influenced subsequent mood. We conducted surveys to explore how people in the UK and Ireland engaged with OCSIs, and found that 70% did so to offer support (e.g. to provide company). Those who did so reported feeling significantly calmer afterwards, those who engaged for general concerns (e.g. in response to anti-social behaviour) reported feeling significantly more anxious afterwards, but there was no difference in reported mood for those who engaged for other reasons (e.g. to share experiences or views). Thus, engaging with an OCSI for altruistic purposes might help to make people feel calmer.","Elphick, Camilla; Stuart, Avelie; Philpot, Richard; Walkington, Zoe; Frumkin, Lara; Zhang, Min; Levine, Mark; Price, Blaine; Pike, Graham; Nuseibeh, Bashar; Bandara, Arosha",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.07153v1.pdf,933
394253,Mitigating the transmission of infection and death due to SARS-CoV-2 through non-pharmaceutical interventions and repurposing drugs,2020,"As a global pandemic, COVID-19 shows no sign of letting up. With the control of the epidemic in China, the proportion of patients with severe and critical diseases being cured and discharged from hospital has increased, and the recovery of COVID-19 patients has become an important issue that urgently needs attention and solutions. By summarizing the exercise rehabilitation strategies and progress of SARS in 2003, this paper analyzed the differences in clinical indicators and recovery characteristics of severe pneumonia caused by the two viruses, and provided comprehensive exercise guidance and intervention strategies for COVID-19 patients for rehabilitation and nursing by referring to the problems and treatment strategies in the rehabilitation and nursing work of SARS. In the post-epidemic period, China will build a multi-dimensional epidemic prevention system by improving the effectiveness of mass training and strengthening local risk prevention and control. This paper discusses the exercise rehabilitation strategy of SARS patients after recovery, which has guiding significance for exercise intervention and scientific fitness of COVID-19 patients after recovery during epidemic prevention period.","Cui, Wei Ouyang Ting Qiu Ye Cui Di",Healthcare,,933
