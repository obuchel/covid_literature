42139,Corona - das Schlachtfeld des 21. Jahrhunderts?,2020-11-25,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has become a global health, social, and economic crisis. Healthcare professionals, patients, healthy individuals, and the whole community are under inevitable psychological pressure which may cause different psychological problems as fear, anxiety, depression, and insomnia. The aim was to assess the impact of the COVID19 pandemic on the attitude, behavior, and mental health of rheumatic patients and to compare them with healthy individuals. This is a case-control study, 360 participants were included and divided into a patient group composed of 180 patients with rheumatic diseases, and a control group composed of 180 healthy people. Data were collected via a self-administered structured questionnaire designed on Google forms. It was sent to participants via social networks and emails to different rheumatic patients and healthy individuals. Mental health was measured by the 5-item Brief Symptom Rating Scale (BSRS-5). RESULTS: The mean age of cases and control were (35.05 ± 8.79 vs 34.56 ± 9.06) years. In comparing attitudes and behavior toward COVID 19, there was a statistically significant difference (p ≤ 0.05) between both groups regarding washing hands, going outdoors, wearing masks and gloves outdoors, and staying in their rooms. Patients depended mainly on telehealth more than usual where about 50% used either phone calls, internet or sent their relatives to their physicians; moreover, 20% did not contact their physicians at all the past few months. There was a statistically significant difference (p ≤ 0.05) between both groups regarding feeling angry/irritated, inferior and insomniac. The BSRS-5 total score and being defined as a psychiatric case (according to the BSRS-5 scale) also differed significantly between patients and controls. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients showed more adherence to their medications and stayed mostly at home and they have higher BSRS scores. CONCLUSION: Patients with rheumatic diseases show comparable degrees of anxiety and depression to healthy individuals, but higher distress symptoms and panic in the form of anger, irritability, and insomnia. They have a significantly higher sense of inferiority and a higher total BSRS compared to controls. SLE patients show more adherence to their medications and stay mostly at home as a reflection of feeling more vulnerable. Moreover, they have higher degrees of psychological affection in the form of higher BSRS scores. Abandoning drug purchasing without medical prescription is necessary in Egypt to protect our patients from unnecessary drug shortages adding to their fear and anxiety. Mental health should be addressed in the same manner we deal with the infectious disease itself, being of no less importance. Mental health professionals, social workers, and support groups need to provide psychological support to vulnerable populations, including patients with rheumatic diseases. Rheumatologists should be aware of the need for psychiatric consultation for their patients whenever necessary.","Hammad, Marwa A.

59802,,2020-12-21,"Is the US ready for a biological attack using Ebola virus or Anthrax? Will vaccine developers be able to produce a Zika virus vaccine, before the epidemic spreads around the world? A recent report by The Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense argues that the US is not ready for these challenges, however, technologies and capabilities that could address these deficiencies are within reach. Vaccine technologies have advanced and readiness has improved in recent years, due to advances in sequencing technology and computational power making the 'vaccines on demand' concept a reality. Building a robust strategy to design effective biodefense vaccines from genome sequences harvested by real-time biosurveillance will benefit from technologies that are being brought to bear on the cancer cure 'moonshot'. When combined with flexible vaccine production platforms, vaccines on demand will relegate expensive and, in some cases, insufficiently effective vaccine stockpiles to the dust heap of history.","De Groot, Anne S; Moise, Leonard; Olive, David; Einck, Leo; Martin, William",Expert review of vaccines,https://doi.org/10.1080/14760584.2016.1205951; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27389971/,728
59843,,2021,"Magnetic skyrmions are prime candidates as information carriers for spintronic devices due to their topological nature and nanometric size. However, unavoidable inhomogeneities inherent to any material leads to pinning or repulsion of skyrmions that, in analogy to biology concepts, define the phenotype of the skyrmion-defect interaction, generating complexity in their motion and challenging their application as future bits of information. Here, we demonstrate that atom-by-atom manufacturing of multi-atomic defects, being antiferromagnetic or ferromagnetic, permits the breeding of their energy profiles, for which we build schematically a Punnet-square. As established from first-principles for skyrmions generated in PdFe bilayer on Ir(111) surface, the resulting interaction phenotype is rich. It can be opposite to the original one and eventually be of dual pinning-repulsive nature yielding energy landscapes hosting multi-domains. This is dictated by the stacking site, geometry, size and chemical nature of the adsorbed defects, which control the involved magnetic interactions. This work provides new insights towards the development of disruptive device architectures incorporating defects into their design aiming to control and guide skyrmions.","Arjana, I Gede; Lima Fernandes, Imara; Chico, Jonathan; Lounis, Samir",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-71232-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32887911/,728
59886,,2021-01-01,"BACKGROUND Guidelines recommending head of bed (HOB) elevation greater than 30º to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia conflict with guidelines to prevent pressure ulcers, which recommend HOB elevation less than 30º. OBJECTIVES To examine the feasibility of 45º HOB elevation and describe and compare the occurrence of reflux, aspiration, and pressure ulcer development at 30º and 45º HOB elevation. METHODS A randomized 2-day crossover trial was conducted. HOB angle was measured every 30 seconds. Oral and tracheal secretions were analyzed for pepsin presence. Skin was assessed for pressure ulcers. Wilcoxon signed rank tests and Kendall τ correlations were conducted. RESULTS Fifteen patients were enrolled; 11 completed both days. Patients were maintained at 30º (mean, 30º) for 96% of minutes and at 45º (mean, 39º) for 77% of minutes. No patients showed signs of pressure ulcers. A total of 188 oral secretions were obtained, 82 (44%) were pepsin-positive; 174 tracheal secretions were obtained, 108 (62%) were pepsin-positive. The median percentage of pepsin-positive oral secretions was not significantly higher (P = .11) at 30º elevation (54%) than at 45º elevation (20%). The median percentage of pepsin-positive tracheal secretions was not significantly higher (P = .37) at 30º elevation (71%) than 45º elevation (67%). Deeper sedation correlated with increased reflux (P = .03). CONCLUSIONS HOB elevation greater than 30º is feasible and preferred to 30º for reducing oral secretion volume, reflux, and aspiration without pressure ulcer development in gastric-fed patients receiving mechanical ventilation. More deeply sedated patients may benefit from higher HOB elevations.","Schallom, Marilyn; Dykeman, Betsy; Metheny, Norma; Kirby, John; Pierce, Janet","American journal of critical care : an official publication, American Association of Critical-Care Nurses",https://doi.org/10.4037/ajcc2015781; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25554555/,728
59909,,2020-10-01,"OBJECTIVES The 5MAX ACE is a new large bore aspiration catheter available for vessel recanalization for treatment of acute ischemic stroke (AIS). We report our initial experience with its use. METHODS A retrospective analysis of patients undergoing intra-arterial therapy for AIS using the 5MAX ACE reperfusion catheter at our institution was performed. Patient demographics, clinical characteristics and procedural data were obtained from chart review. Successful recanlization was defined as achievement of Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction score (TICI) 2b-3 and time to recanalization was defined as time from groin puncture to achievement of at least TICI 2b recanalization. RESULTS The 5MAX ACE was used in 15 patients from July-October 2013. Direct aspiration was used as the primary technique in 10/15 (67%) patients. Out of these, aspiration alone was sufficient for recanalization in 3 (20%) patients. In the remaining 7 (47%) patients, additional devices were used. In 5/15 (33%) patients, combined aspiration/stentriever thrombectomy using Solitaire™ (3/5 patients) and Penumbra 3D Separator™ (2/5 patients) were used as the primary technique. Successful recanlization (TICI 2b-3) was achieved in 11/15 (73%) patients. Average time from groin puncture to successful recanalization was 46 +/- 30 minutes (range 14-98 minutes). There were no procedural complications. CONCLUSION The 5MAX ACE is a useful recanalization tool, either by direct aspiration or combined stentriever/aspiration. It may be most advantageous with large clots in the internal carotid artery. The potential for effective and faster recanalization using this device alone or in combination may be a good topic for future study.","John, Seby; Hussain, Muhammad S; Toth, Gabor; Bain, Mark; Uchino, Ken; Hui, Ferdinand K",Journal of cerebrovascular and endovascular neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.7461/jcen.2014.16.4.350; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25599043/,728

Here, we designed a 31-parameter (29-color) panel to enable the characterization of T cell subsets and immunophenotyping of the human peripheral blood and lymph nodes using cell surface staining. In addition to adaptive T cell markers, TCR Vα24-Jα18, TCR γδ, TCR V&ip.alpha;7.2 and CD161 were included to identify iNKT, γδ T, and MAIT cells, respectively, which are innate-like T cells. C-X-C chemokine receptors (CXCR3, CXCR4, CXCR5, CXCR6) and C-C motif chemokine receptors (CCR4, CCR6, CCR7) were included to enable the identification of Th cell subsets (Th1, Th2, Th17), Tfh cell subsets (Tfh1, Tfh2, Tfh17) and Th cells with specific homing capacities. Furthermore, in this panel, we also used markers for assessing cell differentiation (CD45RO, CD7), activation (CD57, CD95, HLA-DR) and the expression of some co-signaling molecules (PD-1, NKG2D, CD28). Particularly, CD69 and CD103 were included for the further analysis of tissue resident memory T (Trm) cells. This panel would enable the in-depth immunophenotyping of human T cell subsets, and may be applied in the monitoring, prognosis and mechanistic studies of various immune-related diseases.

60387,,2021-08-16,"OBJECTIVE To investigate the implementation and patient satisfaction of telemedicine visits in a Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (PM&R) spine practice during COVID-19. DESIGN Prospective cohort study RESULTS: Out of 172 patients, 97.6% of patients were very satisfied or satisfied (83.7% of the patients were very satisfied) with their telemedicine appointment. In 44.4% of the cases, the PM&R physician prescribed medication to the patient and in 21.6% of the cases either an injection or radiofrequency ablation was ordered. The vast majority of patients, 87%, did not have any issues during their encounter. Lastly, 64.5% of the patients preferred telemedicine over in-person appointments, while 56.1% of the patients who are 60 years old and older responded the same. 67.4% of those who had a follow-up visit would choose telemedicine over in-person. CONCLUSIONS The results of this study show that telemedicine can provide very effective and satisfactory care in a PM&R spine practice. This was especially notable with follow-up visits where imaging and treatment plan can easily be discussed over telemedicine. Stay-at-home orders and improved reimbursement during the COVID-19 pandemic has spurred adoption of telemedicine with high patient satisfaction. We hope that PM&R physicians will be able to continue expanding patient access in the post-pandemic world.","Bhuva, Sheena; Lankford, Craig; Patel, Nayan; Haddas, Ram",American journal of physical medicine & rehabilitation,https://doi.org/10.1097/phm.0000000000001600; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32969967/,728

The association between detected pathogens and ARI development among all participants was examined. A case-control study was conducted to identify risk factors for disease.RESULTSIn total, 78 participants, including the index patient, were enrolled. Of all participants, 27 (34.6%) developed mild respiratory symptoms during a 3-week period: 24 were diagnosed as upper respiratory tract infections, and 3 were diagnosed as lower respiratory tract infections. The presence of BLNAR NTHi was confirmed in 13 participants, and multilocus sequence typing demonstrated that these isolates belonged to sequence type 159. All isolates showed identical pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns. The presence of BLNAR NTHi was strongly associated with ARI development, whereas viruses were not associated with the disease.

The sampling instruments commonly used in aerobiology have also been used to recover viruses suspended in the air. We reviewed over 100 papers to evaluate the methods currently used for viral aerosol sampling. Differentiating infections caused by direct contact from those caused by airborne dissemination can be a very demanding task given the wide variety of sources of viral aerosols. While epidemiological data can help to determine the source of the contamination, direct data obtained from air samples can provide very useful information for risk assessment purposes. Many types of samplers have been used over the years, including liquid impingers, solid impactors, filters, electrostatic precipitators, and many others. The efficiencies of these samplers depend on a variety of environmental and methodological factors that can affect the integrity of the virus structure. The aerodynamic size distribution of the aerosol also has a direct effect on sampler efficiency. Viral aerosols can be studied under controlled laboratory conditions, using biological or nonbiological tracers and surrogate viruses, which are also discussed in this review. Lastly, general recommendations are made regarding future studies on the sampling of airborne viruses.","Verreault, Daniel; Moineau, Sylvain; Duchaine, Caroline",Microbiology and molecular biology reviews : MMBR,https://doi.org/10.1128/mmbr.00002-08; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18772283/,728

Use of the Shannon information entropy, constructed from an intermolecular orientational spatial distribution function, to drive a search for crystal structures via enhanced molecular dynamics can be an efficient way to map out a landscape of putative polymorphs. Here, the Shannon entropy is used to generate a set of collective variables for differentiating polymorphs of a 1:1 cocrystal of resorcinol and urea. We show that driven adiabatic free energy dynamics, a particular enhanced-sampling approach, combined with these entropy variables, can transform the stable phase into alternate polymorphs. Density functional theory calculations confirm that a structure obtained from the enhanced molecular dynamics is stable at pressures above 1 GPa. We thus show that enhanced sampling should be considered an integral component of crystal structure searching protocols for systems with multiple independent molecules.","Song, Hongxing; Vogt-Maranto, Leslie; Wiscons, Ren; Matzger, Adam J; Tuckerman, Mark E",The journal of physical chemistry letters,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpclett.0c02647; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33141590/,728

There is a lack of consensus on the long-term influence of BMI on patient-reported outcomes and satisfaction. This study aimed to examine the differences in patient-reported outcomes over the course of 12 and 24 months among BMI classifications of patients who underwent lumbar surgery. METHODS A search was performed using the Quality Outcomes Database (QOD) Spine Registry from 2012 to 2018 to identify patients who underwent lumbar surgery and had either a 12- or 24-month follow-up. Patients were categorized based on their BMI as normal weight (≤ 25 kg/m2), overweight (25-30 kg/m2), obese (30-40 kg/m2), and morbidly obese (> 40 kg/m2). Outcomes included the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and the visual analog scale (VAS) for back pain (BP) and leg pain (LP), and patient satisfaction was measured at 12 and 24 months postoperatively. RESULTS A total of 31,765 patients were included. At both the 12- and 24-month follow-ups, those who were obese and morbidly obese had worse ODI, VAS-BP, and VAS-LP scores (all p < 0.01) and more frequently rated their satisfaction as ""I am the same or worse than before treatment"" (all p < 0.01) compared with those who were normal weight. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed that the BMI cutoffs for predicting worsening disability and surgery dissatisfaction were 30.1 kg/m2 and 29.9 kg/m2 for the 12- and 24-month follow-ups, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Higher BMI was associated with poorer patient-reported outcomes and satisfaction at both the 12- and 24-month follow-ups.

The authors adopted G-theory parameters yielded from an OSCE hosted by a medical school, reproduced the generalizability coefficients to prepare for optimizing manipulations, applied simulated annealing algorithm to calculate the number of facet levels minimizing the associated costs, and conducted the analysis in various conditions via computer simulation. With a given generalizability coefficient, the proposed approach, virtually an instrument of decision-making supports, found the optimal solution for the OSCE such that the associated costs were minimized. The computer simulation results showed how the cost reductions varied with different levels of required generalizability coefficients. Machine learning-based approaches can be used in conjunction with psychometric modeling to help planning assessment tasks more scientifically. The proposed approach is easy to adopt into practice and customize in alignment with specific testing designs.

Resource allocation in times of scarcity requires transparent, ethical frameworks to optimize decision making and reduce health care worker and patient distress. The complexity of allocating dialysis resources for both patients receiving acute and maintenance dialysis has not previously been addressed. Using a rapid, collaborative, and iterative process, BC Renal, a provincial network in Canada, engaged patients, doctors, ethicists, administrators, and nurses to develop a framework for addressing system capacity, communication challenges, and allocation decisions. The guiding ethical principles that underpin this framework are (1) maximizing benefits, (2) treating people fairly, (3) prioritizing the worst-off individuals, and (4) procedural justice. Algorithms to support resource allocation and triage of patients were tested using simulations, and the final framework was reviewed and endorsed by members of the provincial nephrology community. The unique aspects of this allocation framework are the consideration of two diverse patient groups who require dialysis (acute and maintenance), and the application of two allocation criteria (urgency and prognosis) to each group in a sequential matrix.

65346,,2020-11-01,"OBJECTIVES Calculation of accurate T1 relaxivity (r1) values for gadolinium-based magnetic resonance contrast agents (GBCAs) is a complex process. As such, often referenced r1 values for the GBCAs at 1.5 T, 3 T, and 7 T are based on measurements obtained in media that are not clinically relevant, derived from only a small number of concentrations, or available for only a limited number of GBCAs. This study derives the r1 values of the 8 commercially available GBCAs in human whole blood at 1.5 T, 3 T, and 7 T. MATERIALS AND METHODS Eight GBCAs were serially diluted in human whole blood, at 7 concentrations from 0.0625 to 4 mM. A custom-built phantom held the dilutions in air-tight cylindrical tubes maintained at 37 ± 0.5°C by a heat-circulating system. Images were acquired using inversion recovery sequences with inversion times from 30 milliseconds to 10 seconds at 1.5 T and 3 T as well as 60 milliseconds to 5 seconds at 7 T. A custom MATLAB program was used to automate signal intensity measurements from the images acquired of the phantom. SigmaPlot was used to calculate T1 relaxation times and, finally, r1. RESULTS Measured r1 values in units of s⁻¹·mM⁻¹ at 1.5 T (3 T/7 T) were 3.9 ± 0.2 (3.4 ± 0.4/2.8 ± 0.4) for Gd-DOTA, 4.6 ± 0.2 (4.5 ± 0.3/4.2 ± 0.3) for Gd-DO3A-butrol, 4.3 ± 0.4 (3.8 ± 0.2/3.1 ± 0.4) for Gd-DTPA, 6.2 ± 0.5 (5.4 ± 0.3/4.7 ± 0.1) for Gd-BOPTA, 4.5 ± 0.1 (3.9 ± 0.2/3.7 ± 0.2) for Gd-DTPA-BMA, 4.4 ± 0.2 (4.2 ± 0.2/4.3 ± 0.2) for Gd-DTPA-BMEA, 7.2 ± 0.2 (5.5 ± 0.3/4.9 ± 0.1) for Gd-EOB-DTPA, and 4.4 ± 0.6 (3.5 ± 0.6/3.4 ± 0.1) for Gd-HP-DO3A. The agents can be stratified by relaxivity, with a significant additional dependency on field strength. CONCLUSIONS This report quantifies, for the first time, T1 relaxivity for all 8 gadolinium chelates in common clinical use worldwide, at current relevant field strengths, in human whole blood at physiological temperature (37°C). The measured r1 values differ to a small degree from previously published values, where such comparisons exist, with the current r1 measurements being that most relevant to clinical practice. The macrocyclic agents, with the exception of Gd-DO3A-butrol, have slightly lower r1 values when compared with the 2 much less stable linear agents, Gd-DTPA-BMA and Gd-DTPA-BMEA. The 2 agents with hepatobiliary excretion, Gd-EOB-DTPA and Gd-BOPTA, have, at 1.5 and 3 T, substantially higher r1 values than all other agents.","Shen, Yaqi; Goerner, Frank L; Snyder, Christopher; Morelli, John N; Hao, Dapeng; Hu, Daoyu; Li, Xiaoming; Runge, Val M",Investigative radiology,https://doi.org/10.1097/rli.0000000000000132; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25658049/,728

65733,The innate oxygen dependant immune pathway as a sensitive parameter to predict the performance of biological graft materials.,2012,"Ranaviruses can infect both captive and wild cold-blooded vertebrates, leading to significant economic and environmental losses. With the cases of ranavirus infection increasing, many ranavirus genomic sequences were published, but little is known about ranavirus taxonomy on a whole genome level. In this study, 44 ranaviruses core genes were identified in 32 ranaviruses genome sequences by using PanX. The Neighbor joining phylogenetic trees (NJ-tree) based on 44 ranaviruses core genes and 24 iridoviridae core genes and composition vector phylogenetic tree (CV-Tree) based on whole genome were constructed. The three of phylogenetic trees showed that 32 ranavirus isolates can be divided into 4 different subgroups including SGIV-like, EHNV-like, FV3-like and CMTV-like, and subgroups taxonomic position of three phylogenetic trees were consistent. However, the phylogenetic position of ToRV could not be determined if it belongs to FV3-like or CMTV-like group. Subsequently, we carried out dot plot analysis and confirmed that ToRV should belong to CMTV-like group. Based on dot plot analysis and phylogenetic trees, the taxonomic classification of ranaviruses was confirmed. Finally, 4 genes which are suitable for the construction of phylogenetic tree were selected from ranavirus core genes by recombination analysis, substitution saturation analysis and single-gene phylogenetic analysis. Phylogenetic tree based on concatenated sequences of the 4 selected genes showed that the classification of subgroups was identical with 3 of the phylogenetic trees. Conclusion our results confirmed taxonomic identification of ranaviruses, the 4 selected genes used in phylogenic analysis will make taxonomic identification more convenient and accurate.","Yu, Zehui; Zhang, Wenjie; Gu, Congwei; Chen, Jindong; Zhao, Mingde; Fu, Lu; Han, Jianhong; He, Manli; Xiao, Qihai; Xiao, Wudian; He, Lvqin; Zhang, Zhimin",Transboundary and emerging diseases,https://doi.org/10.1111/tbed.13864; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33006817/,728

66334,,2020-11-09,"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) contains the major glycoprotein, GP5, as well as three other minor glycoproteins, namely, GP2a, GP3, and GP4, on the virion envelope, all of which are required for generation of infectious virions. To study their interactions with each other and with the cellular receptor for PRRSV, we have cloned each of the viral glycoproteins and CD163 receptor in expression vectors and examined their expression and interaction with each other in transfected cells by coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) assay using monospecific antibodies. Our results show that a strong interaction exists between the GP4 and GP5 proteins, although weak interactions among the other minor envelope glycoproteins and GP5 have been detected. Both GP2a and GP4 proteins were found to interact with all the other GPs, resulting in the formation of multiprotein complex. Our results further show that the GP2a and GP4 proteins also specifically interact with the CD163 molecule. The carboxy-terminal 223 residues of the CD163 molecule are not required for interactions with either the GP2a or the GP4 protein, although these residues are required for conferring susceptibility to PRRSV infection in BHK-21 cells. Overall, we conclude that the GP4 protein is critical for mediating interglycoprotein interactions and, along with GP2a, serves as the viral attachment protein that is responsible for mediating interactions with CD163 for virus entry into susceptible host cell.","Das, Phani B; Dinh, Phat X; Ansari, Israrul H; de Lima, Marcelo; Osorio, Fernando A; Pattnaik, Asit K",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01774-09; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19939927/,728

67348,,2020-12-15,"In the current era of the COVID-19 pandemic, the world has never been more interested in the process of vaccine development. While researchers across the globe race to find an effective yet safe vaccine to protect populations from the newly emergent SARS-CoV-2 virus, more than one-third of the world has been subjected to either full or partial lockdown measures. With communities having felt the burden of prolonged isolation, finding a safe and efficacious vaccine will yield direct beneficial effects on protecting against COVID-19 morbidity and mortality and help relieve the psychological and economic load on communities living with COVID-19. There is hope that with the extraordinary efforts of scientists a vaccine will become available. However, given the global public health crisis, development of a COVID-19 vaccine will need to be fast tracked through the usual prelicensing development stages and introduced with limited clinical trial data compared with those vaccines that are developed conventionally over more than a decade. In this scenario, surveillance of the vaccine in the real world becomes even more paramount. This responsibility falls to observational researchers who can provide an essential safety net by continuing to monitor the effectiveness and safety of a COVID-19 vaccine after licensing. Postauthorisation observational studies for safety and effectiveness are complementary to prelaunch clinical trials and not a replacement.

67640,,2020-11-09,"INTRODUCTION Nipple-areolar reconstruction (NAR) is the final phase of breast reconstruction and is associated with increased patient satisfaction. Nipple-areolar reconstruction is typically performed in 2 separate stages, which include nipple reconstruction and tattooing of the nipple-areolar complex (NAC). Previous studies have demonstrated that increased duration of the reconstruction is associated with decreased patient satisfaction. Because a 2-stage reconstruction prolongs the reconstructive process, we introduce a simple and novel method of single-stage NAR (SS NAR), which combines the use of local flaps for nipple reconstruction and medical tattooing of the NAC in 1 session and delivers predictable outcomes with high patient satisfaction. METHODS A retrospective chart review of patients who underwent SS NAR at our institution during the period from September 2010 to May 2012 was performed. Patient demographics, complications, outcomes, and overall patient satisfaction were assessed. A modified questionnaire (Likert scale) was used to assess patient satisfaction of nipple size, color, shape, and projection. RESULTS Twenty-nine SS NARs were performed in 18 patients: 7 unilateral and 11 bilateral. Mean age was 45 years (range, 34-60 years). No major complications were identified. Mean length of follow-up was 10 months (range, 2-22 months). A 17% complication rate was observed: 14% (4/29) had irregular dye uptake of the areola, and 3% (1/29) had dehiscence from silicone guard pressure on the incision. Two patients underwent revisions: one patient underwent additional tattooing, and the other required flap readvancement and implant downsizing secondary to the wound dehiscence. We obtained a 70% survey response rate with 100% of responders who reported that they were ""very satisfied"" with NAC in each dimension. CONCLUSIONS Our study demonstrates that SS NAR is a safe procedure with reproducible, excellent clinical results and very low complication rates or need for revisions. This method is cost-effective, convenient for the patient, and shortens patient recovery time with high patient satisfaction.","Liliav, Benjamin; Loeb, Jennifer; Hassid, Victor J; Antony, Anuja K",Annals of plastic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/sap.0b013e318276dac0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24135688/,728

69659,,2021-04-01,"BACKGROUND Lung recruitment manoeuvres and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) can improve lung function during general anaesthesia. Different recruitment manoeuvre strategies have been described in large international trials: in the protective ventilation using high vs. low PEEP (PROVHILO) strategy, tidal volume (VT) was increased during volume-controlled ventilation; in the individualised peri-operative open-lung approach vs. standard protective ventilation in abdominal surgery (iPROVE) strategy, PEEP was increased during pressure-controlled ventilation. OBJECTIVES To compare the effects of the PROVHILO strategy and the iPROVE strategy on respiratory and haemodynamic variables. DESIGN Randomised crossover study. SETTING University hospital research facility. ANIMALS A total of 20 juvenile anaesthetised pigs. INTERVENTIONS Animals were assigned randomly to one of two sequences: PROVHILO strategy followed by iPROVE strategy or vice-versa (n = 10/sequence). In the PROVHILO strategy, VT was increased stepwise by 4 ml kg-1 at a fixed PEEP of 12 cmH2O until a plateau pressure of 30 to 35 cmH2O was reached. In the iPROVE strategy, at fixed driving pressure of 20 cmH2O, PEEP was increased up to 20 cmH2O followed by PEEP titration according to the lowest elastance of the respiratory system (ERS). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES We assessed regional transpulmonary pressure (Ptrans), respiratory system mechanics, gas exchange and haemodynamics, as well as the centre of ventilation (CoV) by electrical impedance tomography. RESULTS During recruitment manoeuvres with the PROVHILO strategy compared with the iPROV strategy, dorsal Ptrans was lower at end-inspiration (16.3 ± 2.7 vs. 18.6 ± 3.1 cmH2O, P = 0.001) and end-expiration (4.8 ± 2.6 vs. 8.8 ± 3.4 cmH2O, P < 0.001), and mean arterial pressure (MAP) was higher (77 ± 11 vs. 60 ± 14 mmHg, P < 0.001). At 1 and 15 min after recruitment manoeuvres, ERS was higher in the PROVHILO strategy than the iPROVE strategy (24.6 ± 3.9 vs. 21.5 ± 3.4 and 26.7 ± 4.3 vs. 24.0 ± 3.8 cmH2O l-1; P < 0.001, respectively). At 1 min, PaO2 was lower in PROVHILO compared with iPROVE strategy (57.1 ± 6.1 vs. 59.3 ± 5.1 kPa, P = 0.013), but at 15 min, values did not differ. CoV did not differ between strategies. CONCLUSION In anaesthetised pigs, the iPROVE strategy compared with the PROVHILO strategy increased dorsal Ptrans at the cost of lower MAP during recruitment manoeuvres, and decreased ERS thereafter, without consistent improvement of oxygenation or shift of the CoV.

70569,,2020-11-09,"BACKGROUND Evacuation of gastric content through a nasogastric tube, followed by rapid sequence induction, is usually recommended in infants undergoing pyloromyotomy. However, rapid sequence induction may be challenging, and is therefore controversial. Some anaesthetists regularly perform classical non-rapid induction technique, after blind aspiration of the gastric contents, although this aspiration may have been incomplete. This prospective observational study aimed to assess whether the ultrasound monitoring of the aspiration of the stomach contents, may be useful to appropriately guide the choice of the anaesthetic induction technique, in infants undergoing pyloromyotomy. METHODS Infants undergoing pyloromyotomy were consecutively included. Ultrasound assessment of the antrum was performed before and after the aspiration of the gastric contents through a 10 French gastric tube. The stomach was defined as empty when no content was seen in both supine and right lateral positions. The correlation between antral area and the aspirated gastric volume was also tested. RESULTS We analysed 34 infants. Ultrasound examination of the antrum failed in three infants. The stomach was empty in 30/34 infants (nine before aspiration, 21 after aspiration), allowing to perform a non-rapid induction technique in 88.2% of the infants. There was a significant correlation between antral area measured in right lateral decubitus and the aspirated gastric volume. CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest that the qualitative ultrasound assessment of the antral content may be a simple and useful point-of-care tool, for the choice of the most appropriate anaesthetic technique for pyloromyotomy according to the estimated risk of pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents.","Gagey, A-C; de Queiroz Siqueira, M; Desgranges, F-P; Combet, S; Naulin, C; Chassard, D; Bouvet, L",British journal of anaesthesia,https://doi.org/10.1093/bja/aew070; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27106968/,728
70685,,2020-05-05,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE Very low birth weight (VLBW) infants are highly susceptible to viral respiratory infections (VRIs), even during admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Although the role of VRI in childhood in the development of recurrent wheezing and long-term asthma is well known, information on the impact in later morbidity of VRI in the neonatal period is lacking. We aimed to explore the occurrence of recurrent wheezing over the first 2 years of life according to VRI status during NICU admission. METHODS During April 2016 and December 2017, infants below 32 weeks of gestation were prospectively studied in VRI surveillance during NICU admission. Families were contacted between September 2018 and May 2019 by a telephone questionnaire. RESULTS A total of 99 patients were enrolled. The mean gestational age and birth weight were 28.8 (1.9) weeks and 1118 (329) g, respectively. During the first 2 years of life, neither episodes of wheezing nor the respiratory impairment-related hospital admissions differed between positive and negative VRI infants. Episodes of wheezing and respiratory impairment-related hospital admissions, as well as specific respiratory treatment prescription, were more frequent within the first 2 years in infants who had suffered symptomatic VRI during NICU admission. CONCLUSION Symptomatic VRI in VLBW infants is associated with long-term respiratory morbidity. The early surveillance of VRI in the preterm infant during NICU admission is justified for prognostic counseling and closely monitoring after discharge. Routine instruction on asthma-related risk factors and early prescription of antiasthmatic treatments, when indicated, should be established.","Sánchez García, Laura; Pellicer, Adelina; López-Martínez, Clara; García-García, Maria L; Casas, Inmaculada; Pozo, Francisco; Calvo, Cristina",Pediatric pulmonology,https://doi.org/10.1002/ppul.25241; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33406309/,728

Therefore, the methods for optimising perioperative care for the improvement of surgical outcome and to increase efficacy are necessary. The aim of this prospective matched cohort study is to objectify the effect of the fast-track surgery (FTS) programme in patients undergoing primary Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (LRYGB) surgery compared to conventional perioperative care (CPC). METHODS This study compared the perioperative outcome data of two groups of 75 consecutive morbid obese patients who underwent a primary LRYGB according to international guidelines in the periods January 2011-April 2011 (CPC group) and April 2012-June 2012 (FTS group). The two groups were matched for age and sex. Primary endpoints were surgery and hospitalisation time, while secondary endpoints were intraoperative medication use and complication rates. RESULTS Baseline patient characteristics for age, sex, weight and ASA classification were similar (p > 0.05) for CPC and FTS patients. BMI and waist circumference were significantly lower (p < 0.05) in the FTS compared to CPC. The total time from arrival at the operating room to the arrival at the recovery was reduced from 119 to 82 min (p < 0.001). Surgery time was reduced from 80 to 56 min (p < 0.001); mean hospital stay was reduced from 65 to 43 h (p < 0.001). Major complications occurred in 3 versus 4 % in the FTS and CPC, respectively. CONCLUSIONS The introduction of a fast-track programme after primary LRYGB improves short-term recovery and may reduces direct hospital-related resources.","Dogan, Kemal; Kraaij, Linda; Aarts, Edo O; Koehestanie, Parweez; Hammink, Edwin; van Laarhoven, Cees J H M; Aufenacker, Theo J; Janssen, Ignace M C; Berends, Frits J",Obesity surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-014-1355-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24993524/,728

Even very low-dose (N20 and C4) therapy provided significant BP-lowering, and combination therapy was similarly effective in different racial groups. N/C combination demonstrated a lower incidence of vasodilatory adverse events than N monotherapy (18.3 versus 23.6%), including headache (5.5 versus 11.0%; P = 0.003, chi-square test) and peripheral oedema over time (3.6 versus 5.8%; n.s.). CONCLUSION N/C combination was effective in participants with hypertension and showed an improved side effect profile compared with N monotherapy.","Kjeldsen, Sverre E; Sica, Domenic; Haller, Hermann; Cha, Gloria; Gil-Extremera, Blas; Harvey, Peter; Heyvaert, Frank; Lewin, Andrew J; Villa, Giuseppe; Mancia, Giuseppe",Journal of hypertension,https://doi.org/10.1097/hjh.0000000000000331; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25144296/,728
71378,,2020-11-02,"In a field that strives to care for patients and families together, what can palliative care clinicians do when patients' families are physically absent? The Covid-19 pandemic has put both literal and figurative walls between health care professionals and families. How health care workers respond to these disconnections might have a lasting impact on patients, on families, and on our practice. Recently, I saw this in the case of a patient our palliative care team was consulted to see. Mr. B was minimally responsive and dying from multisystem organ failure of unclear etiology. As in other cases during this pandemic, our team became a facilitator of interaction between the patient and the physically absent family, seeing an intimacy we normally would not, in this case, by being present while our intern held the phone to Mr. B's ear for an end-of-life call from his wife, son, and daughter. Such moments force us clinicians to be even more present for our families and patients, and they allow us to bear witness to the strength and sadness and love that we might otherwise miss.","Hauser, Joshua M",The Hastings Center report,https://doi.org/10.1002/hast.1121; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32596884/,728
71652,,2020-11-30,"The precise transplantation, long-term tracking, and maintenance of stem cells with maximizing therapeutic effect are significant challenges in stem cell-based therapy for stroke treatment. In this study, a unique core-shell labeling nanoagent was prepared by encapsulating a cobalt protoporphyrin IX (CoPP)-loaded mesoporous silica nanoparticle (CPMSN) into a 125I-conjugated/spermine-modified dextran polymer (125I-SD) by microfluidics for mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) tracking and activity maintenance. The CPMSN core not only exhibits excellent photoacoustic (PA) imaging performance induced by the intermolecular aggregation of CoPP within the mesopores but also protects the MSCs against oxidative stress by sustained release of CoPP. Meanwhile, the addition of a 125I-SD shell can increase the uptake efficiency in MSCs without inducing cell variability and enable the single-photon-emission computed tomography (SPECT) nuclear imaging. In vivo results indicated that CPMSN@125I-SD labeling could allow for an optimal combination of instant imaging of MSCs, with PA to guide intracerebral injection, followed by multiple time point SPECT imaging to consecutively track the cell homing. Importantly, the sustained release of CoPP from CPMSN@125I-SD significantly increased the survival of MSCs after injection into an ischemic mouse brain and promoted neurobehavioral recovery in ischemic mice. Thus, CPMSN@125I-SD represents a robust theranostic probe for both MSC tracking and maintaining their therapeutic effect in the treatment of brain ischemia.","Yao, Minghua; Shi, Xiaojing; Zuo, Changjing; Ma, Ming; Zhang, Lu; Zhang, Hongbo; Li, Xin; Yang, Guo-Yuan; Tang, Yaohui; Wu, Rong",ACS applied materials & interfaces,https://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c10500; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32806884/,728

RESULTS Participants stockpiled, on average, approximately 6 items, and toilet paper was the item most commonly procured. Approximately 25% of the sample acquired a gun or other weapon in response to the pandemic and approximately 20% of participants stockpiled gold or other precious metals. Stockpiling was more commonly observed among individuals who were more conservative, worried more about the pandemic, and social distanced less.

72219,,2020-11-10,"OBJECTIVE Barrett's oesophagus is a premalignant condition that occurs in the context of gastro-oesophageal reflux. However, most Barrett's cases are undiagnosed because of reliance on endoscopy. We have developed a non-endoscopic tool: the Cytosponge, which when combined with trefoil factor 3 immunohistochemistry, can diagnose Barrett's oesophagus. We investigated whether a quantitative methylation test that is not reliant on histopathological analysis could be used to diagnose Barrett's oesophagus. DESIGN Differentially methylated genes between Barrett's and normal squamous oesophageal biopsies were identified from whole methylome data and confirmed using MethyLight PCR in biopsy samples of squamous oesophagus, gastric cardia and Barrett's oesophagus. Selected genes were then tested on Cytosponge BEST2 trial samples comprising a pilot cohort (n=20 cases, n=10 controls) and a validation cohort (n=149 cases, n=129 controls). RESULTS Eighteen genes were differentially methylated in patients with Barrett'soesophagus compared with squamous controls. Hypermethylation of TFPI2, TWIST1, ZNF345 and ZNF569 was confirmed in Barrett's biopsies compared with biopsies from squamous oesophagus and gastric cardia (p<0.05). When tested in Cytosponge samples, these four genes were hypermethylated in patients with Barrett's oesophagus compared with patients with reflux symptoms (p<0.001). The optimum biomarker to diagnose Barrett's oesophagus was TFPI2 with a sensitivity and specificity of 82.2% and 95.7%, respectively. CONCLUSION TFPI2, TWIST1, ZNF345 and ZNF569 methylation have promise as diagnostic biomarkers for Barrett's oesophagus when used in combination with a simple and cost effective non-endoscopic cell collection device.","Chettouh, Hamza; Mowforth, Oliver; Galeano-Dalmau, Núria; Bezawada, Navya; Ross-Innes, Caryn; MacRae, Shona; Debiram-Beecham, Irene; O'Donovan, Maria; Fitzgerald, Rebecca C",Gut,https://doi.org/10.1136/gutjnl-2017-314026; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29084829/,728
72239,,2021-04-13,"Vaccination is a critical tool in the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Yet, COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy has not been well explored in parts of Nigeria. We assessed the predictors of acceptability of the COVID-19 vaccine and identified reasons for vaccine hesitancy among adults in urban Kano, northern Nigeria. Using a mixed-methods design, we administered structured questionnaires to a cross-section of adults (n = 446), complemented with 20 in-depth interviews. Binary logistic regression and the framework approach were used to analyze the data. About one-half (51.1%, n = 228) of the respondents were willing to take the COVID-19 vaccine. Vaccine acceptance was higher among older respondents (≥30 years) (adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR) = 1.76, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.14-2.99 (≥30 vs. <30), higher-income earners (≥30,000 Naira) (aOR = 2.06, 95%CI:1.12-3.80, ≥30,000 vs. <30,000), and those with a history of a chronic medical disorder (aOR = 1.90, 95%CI:1.06-3.72). Vaccine acceptance was also higher in persons with high risk perception (aOR = 1.61, 95%CI:1.13-2.81, high vs. low), those who were unconcerned about vaccine safety (aOR = 1.71, 95%CI:1.13-3.55), and those who were not worried about efficacy (aOR = 2.02, 95%CI:1.14-4.11) and infertility-related rumors (aOR = 1.98, 95%CI:1.24-3.18). Themes revealed doubts about the existence of COVID-19, mistrust for authorities, and popular credence to rumors and conspiracy theories. In conclusion, COVID-19 vaccine acceptance was sub-optimal and influenced by respondent's age, income, co-morbidities, risk perception, and concerns about vaccine safety, efficacy, and rumors. Context-specific, evidence-based risk communication strategies and trust-building measures could boost vaccine confidence in similar settings.","Iliyasu, Zubairu; Umar, Amina A; Abdullahi, Hadiza M; Kwaku, Aminatu A; Amole, Taiwo G; Tsiga-Ahmed, Fatimah I; Garba, Rayyan M; Salihu, Hamisu M; Aliyu, Muktar H",Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,https://doi.org/10.1080/21645515.2021.1974796; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34613864/,728

The aim of this study was to reach a consensus among experts as to the possible applications of telemedicine in the proctologic field. METHODS A group of 55 clinical practice recommendations was developed by a clinical guidance group based on coalescence of evidence and expert opinion. The Telemedicine in Proctology Italian Working Group included 47 Italian Society of Colorectal Surgery nominated experts evaluating the appropriateness of each clinical practice recommendations based on published RAND/UCLA methodology in 2 rounds. RESULTS Stakeholder median age was 53 years (interquartile range limits 40-60), and 38 (81%) were men. Nine (19%) panelists reported no experience with telemedicine before the pandemic. Agreement was obtained on a minimum of 3 to 5 years of practice in the proctologic field before starting teleconsultations, which should be regularly paid, with advice and prescriptions incorporated into a formal report sent to the patient by e-mail along with a receipt. Of the panelists, 35 of 47 (74%) agreed that teleconsultation carries the risk of misdiagnosis of cancer, thus recommending an in-person assessment before scheduling any surgery. Fifteen additional clinical practice recommendations were re-elaborated in the second round and assessed by 44 of 47 (93.6%) panelists. The application of telemedicine for the diagnosis of common proctologic conditions (eg, hemorrhoidal disease, anal abscess and fistula, anal condylomas, and anal fissure) and functional pelvic floor disorders was generally considered inappropriate. Teleconsultation was instead deemed appropriate for the diagnosis and management of pilonidal disease. CONCLUSION This e-consensus revealed the boundaries of telemedicine in Italy.

72863,,2020-10-26,"Immunosuppression regimens used in solid organ transplant have evolved significantly over the past 70 years in the United States. Early immunosuppression and targets for allograft success were measured by incidence and severity of allograft rejection and 1-year patient survival. The limited number of agents, infancy of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matching techniques and lack of understanding of immunoreactivity limited the early development of effective regimens. The 1980s and 90s saw incredible advancements in these areas, with acute rejection rates halving in a short span of time. However, the constant struggle to achieve the optimal balance between under- and over-immunosuppression is weaved throughout the history of transplant immunosuppression. The aim of this paper is to discuss the different eras of immunosuppression and highlight the important milestones that were achieved while also discussing this in the context of rational agent selection and regimen design. This discussion sets the stage for how we can achieve optimal long-term outcomes during the next era of immunosuppression which will move from universal protocols to patient specific optimization.","Pilch, Nicole A; Bowman, Lyndsey J; Taber, David J",Pharmacotherapy,https://doi.org/10.1002/phar.2481; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33131123/,728

73510,,2021-05-01,"INTRODUCTION With the publication of the recent trials showing the tremendous benefits of mechanical thrombectomy, opportunities exist to refine prehospital processes to identify patients with larger stroke syndromes. MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively reviewed consecutive patients who were brought via scene flight from rural parts of the region to our institution, from December 1, 2014 to June 5, 2015, with severe hemiparesis or hemiplegia. We assessed the accuracy of the diagnosis of stroke and the number of patients requiring endovascular therapy. Moreover, we reviewed the times along the pathway of patients who were treated with endovascular therapy. RESULTS 45 patients were brought via helicopter from the field to our institution. 27 (60%) patients were diagnosed with an ischemic stroke. Of these, 12 (26.7%) were treated with mechanical thrombectomy and 6 (13.3%) with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator alone. An additional three patients required embolization procedures for either a dural arteriovenous fistula or cerebral aneurysm. Thus a total of 15 (33%) patients received an endovascular procedure and 21/45 (46.7%) received an acute treatment. For patients treated with thrombectomy, the median time from first medical contact to groin puncture was 101 min, with 8 of the 12 patients (66.7%) being discharged to home. CONCLUSIONS We have presented a pilot study showing that severe hemiparesis or hemiplegia may be a reasonable prehospital tool in recognizing patients requiring endovascular treatment. Patients being identified earlier may be treated faster and potentially improve outcomes. Further prospective controlled studies are required to assess the impact on outcomes and cost effectiveness using this methodology.","Gupta, Rishi; Manuel, Marissa; Owada, Kumiko; Dhungana, Samish; Busby, Leslie; Glenn, Brenda A; Brown, Debbie; Zimmermann, Susan A; Horn, Christopher; Rochestie, Dustin; Hormes, Joseph T; Johnson, Andrew K; Khaldi, Ahmad",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2015-011940; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26276076/,728
73673,,2021-05-19,"Vascular endothelial dysfunction is part of the underlying pathophysiology of heart failure. However, there are no reports in which vascular endothelial function of both conduit arteries and microvasculature was assessed in patients with heart failure. This study was aimed to assess vascular endothelial function separately in heart failure with reduced (HFrEF) and preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). We performed simultaneous measurement of both flow-mediated vasodilation for endothelial function of conduit arteries and reactive hyperemia-peripheral arterial tonometry for that of microvasculature in 88 consecutive patients with chronic heart failure. In 55 patients with ischemic heart disease as an underlying cause of heart failure, flow-mediated vasodilation value was comparable between the two groups of HFrEF (left ventricular ejection fraction < 50%, n = 31) and HFpEF (left ventricular ejection fraction ≥ 50%, n = 24). Reactive hyperemia index measured by reactive hyperemia peripheral arterial tonometry, however, was lower in HFrEF patients compared to HFpEF patients (P = 0.014). In contrast, among 33 patients with non-ischemic heart disease, the degree of flow-mediated vasodilation was lower in HFpEF patients (n = 18) compared with HFrEF patients (n = 15) (P = 0.009), while reactive hyperemia index was comparable between the two groups. The clinical and pathophysiological significance of endothelial function in heart failure differs between conduit artery and microvasculature, and these differences may contribute to the underlying pathophysiology of HFpEF and HFrEF, as well as in ischemic heart disease and non-ischemic heart disease.","Waku, Ryutaro; Tokoi, Seiko; Toyoda, Shigeru; Kitahara, Keijiro; Naganuma, Jin; Yazawa, Hiroko; Sakuma, Masashi; Abe, Shichiro; Nakajima, Toshiaki; Inoue, Teruo",The Tohoku journal of experimental medicine,https://doi.org/10.1620/tjem.252.85; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32893258/,728

OBJECTIVE.— To critically evaluate 2 commercially available SARS-CoV-2 serology tests. DESIGN.— A total of 333 unique, nonduplicated serum samples obtained from COVID-19 patients (n = 170) and negative controls (n = 163) obtained before December 2019 were used in the study. Samples were tested on the Roche E411 and Abbott Architect i4000SR platforms, and results were correlated to reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results and clinical symptoms. RESULTS.— There was a strong level of agreement in the qualitative results between both assays, with a Cohen κ value of .840, P < .001. The specificity for both Roche and Abbott were excellent at 100%. Roche exhibited marginally better performance in the 21 days or more group with a sensitivity of 90.6% (95% CI, 75.8%-96.8%) versus an Abbott sensitivity of 84.4% (95% CI, 68.3%-93.1%), as well as in the 14- to 20-day group with a sensitivity of 85.7% (95% CI, 65.4%-95.0%) versus an Abbott sensitivity of 81.0% (95% CI, 60.0%-92.3%). Less than 14 days of symptoms groups exhibited poor sensitivity at less than 50% for both assays. The areas under curve (± standard error) for Roche (0.894 ± 0.025, P < .001) and Abbott (0.884 ± 0.026, P < .001) were very similar. Potential confounders for negative serologic results include antiretroviral medication use and pauci-symptomatic patients. CONCLUSIONS.— Specificities for high-throughput Roche and Abbott immunoassays are excellent, but users need to be cautious to interpret serologic test results after 14 days of symptoms to avoid false negatives.","Tan, Shaun S; Saw, Sharon; Chew, Ka Lip; Wang, Cindy; Pajarillaga, Anastacia; Khoo, Candy; Wang, Weixuan; Ali, Zahidah Mohamed; Yang, Zhixin; Chan, Yiong Huak; Tambyah, Paul; Jureen, Roland; Sethi, Sunil K",Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,https://doi.org/10.5858/arpa.2020-0499-sa; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33367664/,728
74204,,2021-03-01,"In recent years, there have been a number of claims and counterclaims from suicide research using time series and longitudinal data; in particular, the linkage of increased antidepressant prescriptions to a decrease in suicide rates. Suicide time series appear to have a memory compounded with seasonal and cyclic effects. Failure to take into account these properties may lead to misleading conclusions, e.g., a downward blip is interpreted as the result of current knowledge and public health policies, while an upward blip is explained as suicide being complex depending on many variables requiring further research. In previous publications, I argued that this misuse of time series data is the result of an uncritical acceptance of a medical model that links mental ill-health to suicide. The consequences of such research behaviour are further increases in antidepressant prescriptions and medications to those who should not be prescribed them, with adverse effects showing across the population, e.g., the prescription of antidepressants to very young children (some under 1 year of age) in New Zealand. Moreover, the New Zealand Evidence-based Health Care Bulletin recommends an authoritarian approach for every interaction with a young person to check their psychosocial well-being. When viewed holistically, this kind of human behaviour makes researchers, policy makers (politicians), treatment, and practitioners, and society in general part of the problem rather than the solution. This paper explores some dynamic aspects of suicide, using only official data with particular reference to youth suicide, and suggests that the medical model of suicide is only an attempt to treat depression without addressing suicide, and recommends the creation of a unified database through understanding the society that individuals live in. It is hoped that this paper will stimulate debate and the collaboration of international experts regardless of their school of thought.","Shahtahmasebi, Said",TheScientificWorldJournal,https://doi.org/10.1100/tsw.2008.46; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18379706/,728

DATA SOURCES Five databases (EMBASE, Medline, CINAHL, Web of Science, Scopus) were searched from inception to September 2020. The main outcomes of interest were pain, disability and return to sport (RTS). RESULTS Among 1629 references, 14 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving 541 athletes were included. The trials had biases across multiple domains including performance, attrition and reporting. Treatments included exercise, biomechanical modifications and manual therapy. There were no trials evaluating the efficacy of surgery or injections. Exercise was the most frequently investigated treatment; no RTS data were reported for any exercise intervention. There was a reduction in pain and disability reported after all treatments. CONCLUSIONS While several treatments for LBP in athletes improved pain and function, it was unclear what the most effective treatments were, and for whom. Exercise approaches generally reduced pain and improved function in athletes with LBP, but the effect on RTS is unknown. No conclusions regarding the value of manual therapy (massage, spinal manipulation) or biomechanical modifications alone could be drawn because of insufficient evidence.

This viewpoint offers an overview of the opportunities and challenges mHealth innovators must navigate to create an integrated digital ecosystem for mental health care moving forward. Opportunities exist for innovators to develop tools that can collect a vast range of active and passive patient and transdiagnostic symptom data. Moving away from a symptom-count approach to a transdiagnostic view of psychopathology has the potential to facilitate early and accurate diagnosis, and can further enable personalized treatment strategies. However, the uptake of these technologies critically depends on the perceived relevance and engagement of end users. To this end, behavior theories and codesigning approaches offer opportunities to identify behavioral drivers and address barriers to uptake, while ensuring that products meet users' needs and preferences. The agenda for innovators should also include building strong evidence-based cases for digital mental health, moving away from a one-size-fits-all well-being approach to embrace the development of comprehensive digital diagnostics and validated digital tools. In particular, innovators have the opportunity to make their clinical evaluations more insightful by assessing effectiveness and feasibility in the intended context of use. Finally, innovators should adhere to standardized evaluation frameworks introduced by regulators and health care providers, as this can facilitate transparency and guide health care professionals toward clinically safe and effective technologies.

Diabetic retinopathy screening leading to early identification of the disease followed by timely treatment, can prevent vision loss in people living with diabetes. A key barrier to the implementation of screening services in low- and middle-income countries is the low number of ophthalmologists per million population. Interventions that shift screening to non-ophthalmology cadres have been implemented in programmes in low- and middle-income countries and are routinely used in high-income countries. The aim of this rapid review is to summarise the published literature reporting the effectiveness of task-shifting interventions for the detection of diabetic retinopathy by non-ophthalmologists in low- and middle-income countries. METHODS We will search MEDLINE, Embase, Global Health and Cochrane Register of Studies for studies reporting task-shifting interventions for diabetic retinopathy detection. The review will include studies published in the last 10 years in the English language. We will include any interventional or observational comparative study measuring outcomes in terms of participation or access to diabetic retinopathy detection services (uptake) and quality of diabetic retinopathy detection services (detection, severity, diagnostic accuracy). For included studies, cost-effectiveness of the task-shifting intervention will also be presented. Two reviewers will screen search results independently. The risk of bias assessment and data extraction will be carried out by one reviewer with verification of 10% of the papers by a second reviewer. The results will be synthesised narratively. DISCUSSION Differences in health systems organization, structure and resources will determine the need and success of task-shifting interventions for DR screening. The review will examine how these interventions have been used and/or tested in LMICs. The results will be of interest to policy makers and programme managers tasked with designing and implementing services to prevent and manage diabetes and its complications in similar settings.

Validation by the full nAMD Barometer Leadership Coalition was established using a modified Delphi approach, with predetermined mean scores of 7.5 or more signifying consensus. Subsequent endorsement of the definitions was provided from a second set of retinal experts, with more than 50% members agreeing or strongly agreeing with all definitions. Main Outcomes and Measures Development of consensus definitions for the terms adherence and persistence and a classification system for the factors associated with treatment nonadherence or nonpersistence in patients with nAMD. Results Nonadherence was defined as missing 2 or more treatment or monitoring visits over a period of 12 months, with a visit considered missed if it exceeded more than 2 weeks from the recommended date. Nonpersistence was defined by nonattendance or an appointment not scheduled within the last 6 months. The additional terms planned discontinuation and transfer of care were also established. Reasons for treatment nonadherence and nonpersistence were classified into 6 dimensions: (1) patient associated, (2) condition associated, (3) therapy associated, (4) health system and health care team associated, (5) social/economic, and (6) other, with subcategories specific to treatment for nAMD. Conclusions and Relevance This classification system provides a framework for assessing treatment nonadherence and nonpersistence over time and across different health settings in the treatment of nAMD with current intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor treatments. This may have additional importance, given the potential association of the coronavirus pandemic on adherence to treatment in patients with nAMD.","Okada, Mali; Wong, Tien Yin; Mitchell, Paul; Eldem, Bora; Talks, S James; Aslam, Tariq; Daien, Vincent; Rodriguez, Francisco J; Gale, Richard; Barratt, Jane; Finger, Robert P; Loewenstein, Anat",JAMA ophthalmology,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2021.1660; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34081099/,728

Randomized controlled trials from 2012 to 2016 were identified using the Medline database through ""Gastric bypass OR sleeve gastrectomy AND weight"" search terms. A total of 73 studies with 5948 patients were included. Reporting of preoperative weight was done primarily using mean body mass index (BMI) (87.7%) and mean weight (65.8%). Postoperative weight reporting was more variable, with the most frequently reported measure being mean postoperative BMI (71.2%). Overall, nearly one third of all bariatric literature contained discrepancies that precluded meaningful meta-analysis.

The objective of this study is to test a machine-learning (ML) method based on radiomics features extracted from chest CT images for screening COVID-19 cases. METHODS The study is carried out on two groups of patients, including 138 patients with confirmed and 140 patients with suspected COVID-19. We focus on distinguishing pneumonia caused by COVID-19 from the suspected cases by segmentation of whole lung volume and extraction of 86 radiomics features. Followed by feature extraction, nine feature-selection procedures are used to identify valuable features. Then, ten ML classifiers are applied to classify and predict COVID-19 cases. Each ML models is trained and tested using a ten-fold cross-validation method. The predictive performance of each ML model is evaluated using the area under the curve (AUC) and accuracy. RESULTS The range of accuracy and AUC is from 0.32 (recursive feature elimination [RFE]+Multinomial Naive Bayes [MNB] classifier) to 0.984 (RFE+bagging [BAG], RFE+decision tree [DT] classifiers) and 0.27 (mutual information [MI]+MNB classifier) to 0.997 (RFE+k-nearest neighborhood [KNN] classifier), respectively. There is no direct correlation among the number of the selected features, accuracy, and AUC, however, with changes in the number of the selected features, the accuracy and AUC values will change. Feature selection procedure RFE+BAG classifier and RFE+DT classifier achieve the highest prediction accuracy (accuracy: 0.984), followed by MI+Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB) and logistic regression (LGR)+DT classifiers (accuracy: 0.976). RFE+KNN classifier as a feature selection procedure achieve the highest AUC (AUC: 0.997), followed by RFE+BAG classifier (AUC: 0.991) and RFE+gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) classifier (AUC: 0.99). CONCLUSION This study demonstrates that the ML model based on RFE+KNN classifier achieves the highest performance to differentiate patients with a confirmed infection caused by COVID-19 from the suspected cases.","Masoud Rezaeijo, Seyed; Abedi-Firouzjah, Razzagh; Ghorvei, Mohammadreza; Sarnameh, Samad",Journal of X-ray science and technology,https://doi.org/10.3233/xst-200831; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33612539/,728
77181,,2021-08-01,"Psoriasis is a severe disease associated with the disturbance of metabolism and inflammation, but the molecular mechanisms underlying these aspects of psoriasis pathology are poorly understood. Here, we report that glutaminase 1-mediated (GLS1-mediated) glutaminolysis was aberrantly activated in patients with psoriasis and in psoriasis-like mouse models, which promoted Th17 and γδ T17 (IL-17A-producing γδ T) cell differentiation through enhancement of histone H3 acetylation of the Il17a promoter, thereby contributing to the immune imbalance and development of psoriasis. We further demonstrate that mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation protein 1 (MALT1) protease was constitutively active in psoriatic CD4+ and γδ T cells, thereby supporting GLS1 expression by stabilizing c-Jun, which directly binds to the GLS1 promoter region. Blocking the activity of either GLS1 or MALT1 protease resolved Th17 and γδ T17 cell differentiation and epidermal hyperplasia in the psoriasis-like mouse models. Finally, IL-17A enhanced GLS1 expression via the MALT1/cJun pathway in keratinocytes, resulting in hyperproliferation of and chemokine production by keratinocytes.

77504,,2020-05-08,"The World Health Organization global call to eliminate cervical cancer encourages countries to consider introducing or improving cervical cancer screening programs. Brazil's Unified Health System (SUS) is among the world's largest public health systems offering free cytology testing, follow-up colposcopy, and treatment. Yet, health care networks across the country have unequal infrastructure, human resources, equipment, and supplies resulting in uneven program performance and large disparities in cervical cancer incidence and mortality. An effective screening program needs multiple strategies feasible for each community's reality, facilitating coverage and follow-up adherence. Prioritizing those at highest risk with tests that better stratify risk will limit inefficiencies, improving program impact across different resource settings. Highly sensitive human papillomavirus (HPV)-DNA testing performs better than cytology and, with self-collection closer to homes and workplaces, improves access, even in remote regions. Molecular triage strategies like HPV genotyping can identify from the same self-collected sample, those at highest risk requiring follow-up. If proven acceptable, affordable, cost-effective, and efficient in the Brazilian context, these strategies would increase coverage while removing the need for speculum exams for routine screening and reducing follow-up visits.

77571,,2020-11-16,"BACKGROUND Recent reports suggest that racial differences in breast cancer incidence rates have decreased. We examined whether these findings apply to breast cancer mortality while considering age, period, and cohort influences on both absolute and relative measures of breast cancer mortality. METHODS Using publicly available datasets (CDC WONDER, Human Mortality Database), we developed an age-period-cohort model of breast cancer mortality and breast cancer deaths as a proportion of all deaths during 1968-2019 among all women and by five race/ethnicity groups with sufficient numbers for estimation: Hispanic (all races), American Indian/Alaska Native and Asian/Pacific Islanders (regardless of ethnicity), non-Hispanic Black, and non-Hispanic White. RESULTS Initially increasing after 1968, age-adjusted breast cancer mortality rates have decreased among all racial/ethnic groups since 1988. The age-adjusted percent of all deaths due to breast cancer also has been declining for non-Hispanic White women since about 1990 while increasing or holding steady for other race/ethnic groups. In 2019, the age-adjusted percent of deaths due to breast cancer for women was highest for Asian/Pacific Islanders (5.6%) followed by non-Hispanic Black (4.5%), Hispanic (4.4%), non-Hispanic White (4.1%), and American Indian/Alaska Native women (2.6%).

77692,,2020-11-09,"BACKGROUND/AIMS Pediatric aneurysms are rare, accounting for 0.5-4.6% of all intracranial aneurysms. Dissecting vertebrobasilar aneurysms (DVBA) are more frequently observed among children than adults. Cases acutely presenting with subarachnoid hemorrhage need a prompt treatment because of the higher mortality related to untreated cases. Options for an active DVBA management depend on the features of the malformation and include endovascular and surgical approaches. METHODS We refer to an 8-year-old healthy female, who presented with a sudden severe headache and vomit, followed by a half-hour loss of consciousness. A CT scan revealed subarachnoid hemorrhage, and brain MR angiography showed a lesion with mass effect on bulbar structures, suggestive of an aneurysm of the vertebrobasilar junction. The intracranial angiography confirmed this diagnosis and showed a relevant revascularization coming from the anterior cerebral circulation. RESULTS Endovascular treatment was considered as a suitable option and occlusion of both vertebral arteries, saving the left posterior inferior cerebellar artery, was performed. No neurological deficits appeared after embolization, and the patient was clinically stable at 18 months of follow-up. CONCLUSION In the 'stent era', parent vessel deconstruction throughout endovascular balloon or coil occlusion could be considered in patients with a sound collateral circulation and when cerebellar hemisphere and encephalic trunk feeding is not compromised.","Rizzi, Michele; De Benedictis, Alessandro; Marras, Carlo Efisio; Palma, Paolo; Desiderio, Flora; Rollo, Massimo",Pediatric neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.1159/000351578; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23860364/,728

Eighty women, who underwent total hysterectomy by the LESS (n = 40) and CMPL (n = 40) technique due to benign and malign gynecological disorders, were evaluated with a cosmesis and body image questionnaire in an age-matched cohort study. Median follow-up time was 25 (6-30) months in both groups. The mean age of the patients was 49.3 ± 6.3 years. The mean body image scale scores were 5.3 ± 0.6 and 5.5 ± 1.2 in the LESS and CMPL groups, respectively (p = 0.268). The mean cosmesis and scar scale scores were significantly higher in the LESS group compared to the CMPL group (p = .011 and p < .001, respectively). Port-site hernia was detected in two patients in the LESS group, but not in the CMPL group. There was no cuff dehiscence in the LESS nor in the CMPL group. The LESS technique provides better cosmesis when compared with the CMPL technique. The body image perceptions in the two groups were similar. Women who wish to undergo the LESS surgery should be informed about the risk of incisional hernia. Impact statement What is already known on this subject? Short-term results of LESS hysterectomy such as complication rates, additional port requirement, conversion to CMPL or laparotomy, pain score and analgesic use were evaluated in various studies. Several studies have been published on the safety and efficacy of single-port laparoscopic hysterectomy (LH); however, it has been unclear whether single-port LH offers benefits over multiport LH regarding long-term patient satisfaction and cosmetic satisfaction. What do the results of this study add? In this prospective cohort study, we aimed to compare long-term results (at least six months) of abdominal incisional scar between LESS and CMPL surgery for hysterectomy. The LESS technique provides better cosmesis when compared with the CMPL technique, although, the body image perceptions in the two groups were similar. What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research? LESS technique can be offered as an option for hysterectomy since it provides better long-term cosmesis compared to CMPL.","Demirayak, Gökhan; Özdemir, İsa Aykut; Comba, Cihan; Çetin, Berna Aslan; Aydogan Mathyk, Begüm; Yıldız, Mustafa; Mihmanlı, Veli; Karaca, İbrahim; Öztürk, Mustafa; Güralp, Onur",Journal of obstetrics and gynaecology : the journal of the Institute of Obstetrics and Gynaecology,https://doi.org/10.1080/01443615.2019.1606183; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31347412/,728
78092,,2020-11-01,"Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of tirofiban for patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS), especially posterior circulation stroke (PCS). Methods: We enrolled consecutive patients with AIS who suffered large artery occlusion (LAO) and underwent mechanical thrombectomy (MT) between January 2016 and May 2020. Patients were divided into two groups according to whether tirofiban was used during MT. The primary efficacy outcome was a favorable functional outcome, defined as a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 0-2 at 3 months. The safety outcomes were the rate of mortality at 3 months and the presence of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH). Cohorts were balanced using 1:1 propensity score matching (PSM). Subgroup analysis was further performed to compare the efficacy and safety of tirofiban between the anterior circulation stroke (ACS) and PCS groups. Results: A total of 292 patients were eligible for this study and divided into the tirofiban group (n = 51) and the no-tirofiban group (n = 241). In the propensity-score-matched cohort, the tirofiban group had a higher rate of favorable outcomes than the no-tirofiban group (49.0 vs. 25.5%, p = 0.014), and the mortality at 3 months showed a greater downward trend in the tirofiban group than the no-tirofiban group (15.6 vs. 33.3% p = 0.064). The risk of sICH and ICH was the same between the tirofiban and control groups (17.6 vs. 27.4% p = 0.236, 31.3 vs. 45.1% p = 0.154, respectively). Tirofiban use was predictive of favorable outcomes [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 2.87, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.52-6.44, p = 0.043] after multiple logistic regression analysis. Subgroup analysis revealed that tirofiban use was significantly associated with favorable outcomes in ACS (aOR = 3.66, 95% CI 1.24-5.22, p = 0.019) but not in PCS (aOR = 1.12, 95% CI 0.47-7.52, p = 0.570). Conclusion: We demonstrated that tirofiban may be associated with improving favorable outcome for the AIS patients who underwent MT, without increasing ICH or sICH. Furthermore, our results indicated that for PCS patients tirofiban may not be associated with favorable outcome, and more comprehensive randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm this finding.","Cai, Lingxin; Yu, Xiaobo; Yu, Jun; Xu, Jing; Xu, Liang; Ling, Chenhan; Lou, Min; Yu, Cheng; Qian, Cong",Frontiers in neurology,https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2021.688019; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34589044/,728

79929,,2020-07-01,"OBJECTIVES To compare the surgical outcomes of laparoscopic radical prostatectomy and robot-assisted radical prostatectomy, including the frequency and location of positive surgical margins. METHODS The study cohort comprised 708 consecutive male patients with clinically localized prostate cancer who underwent laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (n = 551) or robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (n = 157) between January 1999 and September 2012. Operative time, estimated blood loss, complications, and positive surgical margins frequency were compared between laparoscopic radical prostatectomy and robot-assisted radical prostatectomy. RESULTS There were no significant differences in age or body mass index between the laparoscopic radical prostatectomy and robot-assisted radical prostatectomy patients. Prostate-specific antigen levels, Gleason sum and clinical stage of the robot-assisted radical prostatectomy patients were significantly higher than those of the laparoscopic radical prostatectomy patients. Robot-assisted radical prostatectomy patients suffered significantly less bleeding (P < 0.05). The overall frequency of positive surgical margins was 30.6% (n = 167; 225 sites) in the laparoscopic radical prostatectomy group and 27.5% (n = 42; 58 sites) in the robot-assisted radical prostatectomy group. In the laparoscopic radical prostatectomy group, positive surgical margins were detected in the apex (52.0%), anterior (5.3%), posterior (5.3%) and lateral regions (22.7%) of the prostate, as well as in the bladder neck (14.7%). In the robot-assisted radical prostatectomy patients, they were observed in the apex, anterior, posterior, and lateral regions of the prostate in 43.0%, 6.9%, 25.9% and 15.5% of patients, respectively, as well as in the bladder neck in 8.6% of patients. CONCLUSIONS Positive surgical margin distributions after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy and laparoscopic radical prostatectomy are significantly different. The only disadvantage of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy is the lack of tactile feedback. Thus, the robotic surgeon needs to take this into account to minimize the risk of positive surgical margins.","Tozawa, Keiichi; Yasui, Takahiro; Umemoto, Yukihiro; Mizuno, Kentaro; Okada, Atsushi; Kawai, Noriyasu; Takahashi, Satoru; Kohri, Kenjiro",International journal of urology : official journal of the Japanese Urological Association,https://doi.org/10.1111/iju.12492; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24912809/,728

It is unclear how goals-of-care discussions should occur. The objective of the study was to determine which patients could benefit, requirements, content, documentation, and harms and benefits of emergency medicine goals-of-care discussions. We sought primary evidence on goals-of-care discussions in EDs with adult patients nearing end-of-life, published in English after 1989. Data sources included Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Web of Science and reference lists of included articles. One thousand nine hundred and twenty abstracts were screened, five articles selected. There was no consensus on the meaning of goals-of-care, which is often confused with advanced care planning and treatment limitation. Emergency clinicians can identify most patients needing discussions following training. There was no evidence for how to involve stakeholders, nor how to adapt conversations to meet cultural and linguistically diverse needs. Expert panels have suggested requirements and content for conversations with little supporting evidence. There was no evidence for how emergency conversations differ to those in other settings, nor for harms or benefits for holding goals-of-care conversations in EDs. Increased ED goals-of-care conversations increased hospice referral and reduced in-patient admissions.

Factors that might protect children include: (1) differences in innate and adaptive immunity; (2) more frequent recurrent and concurrent infections; (3) pre-existing immunity to coronaviruses; (4) differences in microbiota; (5) higher levels of melatonin; (6) protective off-target effects of live vaccines and (7) lower intensity of exposure to SARS-CoV-2.","Zimmermann, Petra; Curtis, Nigel",Archives of disease in childhood,https://doi.org/10.1136/archdischild-2020-320338; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33262177/,728
81870,,2020-03-31,"INTRODUCTION Dermoscopy is an integrative part of clinical dermatologic examination. For clinicians mainly dealing with genital dermatoses and other venereal diseases, the differential diagnosis includes a broad spectrum of neoplastic, inflammatory, and infectious entities. Dermoscopy might have a valuable role to enhance the clinical differential diagnosis and help avoid some biopsies done for diagnostic purposes. Although the dermoscopic patterns of most tumors and inflammatory diseases of the trunk/face have been described, their manifestations on genital areas are less elucidated. We aimed to provide a succinct summary of existing data on dermoscopy of dermatologic diseases on genital areas. METHODS A literature search was performed on PubMed using the terms dermoscopy OR dermatoscopy OR videodermoscopy OR video dermoscopy AND genital. All studies reporting on dermoscopic findings of at least one case of a dermatologic disease on genital areas were included in the review. Unless otherwise indicated, ×10 was the magnification used in the reported studies. The main outcome was to describe the dermoscopic feature of each disease. RESULTS A total of 31 articles were identified and analyzed. They included single case reports and case series. The described entities were categorized into anatomical variants, vascular and lymphatic lesions, tumors, inflammatory disorders, and infectious conditions. CONCLUSION In diseases of the genital area, dermoscopic findings can be highly diagnostic and might establish a confident diagnosis. Limitation is that most of the criteria are based on case series, and few of them have been validated.","Maatouk, Ismael; Apalla, Zoe; Errichetti, Enzo; Lallas, Aimilios",International journal of dermatology,https://doi.org/10.1111/ijd.15333; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33448049/,728
82139,,2020-08-01,"ConspectusThis Account describes fundamental chemistry that promoted the discovery of new antibiotics. Specifically, the NH acidity of simple hydroxamic acid derivatives facilitated the syntheses of novel β-lactams (oxamazins and monobactams), siderophore mimics that limit bacterial iron uptake and bacterially targeted sideromycins (siderophore-antibiotic conjugates). The development of resistance to our current limited set of antibiotic scaffolds has created a dire medical situation. As recently stated, ""if you weren't taking antibiotic resistance seriously before, now would be a good time to start."" A project commissioned by the British government (https://amr-review.org/) has released estimates of the near-future global toll of antibiotic resistance that are jaw-dropping in their seriousness and scale: 10 million deaths per year and at least $100 trillion in sacrificed gross national product. The 2020 COVID pandemic confirmed that infectious disease problems are no longer localized but worldwide. Many classical antibiotics, especially β-lactams, previously provided economical cures, but the evolution of antibiotic destructive enzymes (i.e., β-lactamases), efflux pumps, and bacterial cell wall permeability barriers has made many types of bacteria, especially Gram-negative strains, resistant. Still, and in contrast to other therapies, the public expectation is that any new antibiotic must be inexpensive. This creates market limitations that have caused most major pharmaceutical companies to abandon antibiotic research. Much needs to be done to address this significant problem.The critical need for bacteria to sequester essential iron provides an Achilles' heel for new antibiotic development. Although ferric iron is extremely insoluble, bacteria need micromolar intracellular concentrations for growth and virulence. To this end, they biosynthesize siderophores (Gr. iron bearer) and excrete them into their environment, where they bind iron with high affinity. The iron complexes are recognized by specific outer-membrane transporters, and once actively internalized, the iron is released for essential processes. To conserve biosynthetic energy, some bacteria recognize and utilize siderophores made by competing strains. As a counter-revolution in the never-ending fight for survival, bacteria have also evolved sideromycins, which are siderophores conjugated to warheads that are lethal to rogue bacteria. While none are now used therapeutically, natural sideromycins called albomycins have been used clinically, and others have been shown to be well tolerated and active in animal infection models. Herein we describe practical methods to synthesize new antibiotics and artificial sideromycins with the generalized structure shown above (siderophore-linker drug). Utilizing the molecular-recognition-based siderophore/sideromycin bacterial assimilation processes, it is possible to design both broad spectrum and exquisitely narrow spectrum (targeted) sideromycins and even repurpose older or more classical antibiotics. Relevant microbiological assays, in vivo animal infection studies, and the recent FDA approval of cefiderocol demonstrate their effectiveness.","Miller, Marvin J; Liu, Rui",Accounts of chemical research,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.accounts.1c00004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33684288/,728

82344,,2020,"How force generated by the morphogenesis of one tissue impacts the morphogenesis of other tissues to achieve an elongated embryo axis is not well understood. The notochord runs along the length of the somitic compartment and is flanked on either side by somites. Vacuolating notochord cells undergo a constrained expansion, increasing notochord internal pressure and driving its elongation and stiffening. Therefore, the notochord is appropriately positioned to play a role in mechanically elongating the somitic compartment. We use multi-photon cell ablation to remove specific regions of the notochord and quantify the impact on axis elongation. We show that anterior expansion generates a force that displaces notochord cells posteriorly relative to adjacent axial tissues, contributing to the elongation of segmented tissue during post-tailbud stages. Unexpanded cells derived from progenitors at the posterior end of the notochord provide resistance to anterior notochord cell expansion, allowing for stress generation along the AP axis. Therefore, notochord cell expansion beginning in the anterior, and addition of cells to the posterior notochord, act as temporally coordinated morphogenetic events that shape the zebrafish embryo AP axis.","McLaren, Susannah B P; Steventon, Benjamin J",Development,https://doi.org/10.1242/dev.199459; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34086031/,728

We report the characteristics and outcomes of MERS-CoV-confirmed patients who developed critical illness requiring admission to an intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS We conducted a prospective cohort study of all MERS-CoV-confirmed cases who were admitted to our ICU from March 20, 2014, till June 1, 2014. Presenting symptoms, comorbid conditions, and details of their ICU stay were recorded. RESULTS Eight patients were admitted to the ICU with MERS-CoV infection. All had signs of respiratory distress with 7 requiring mechanical ventilation. Three patients were health care workers. In all, 6 patients had comorbid conditions and 5 patients developed multiorgan system failure (MOSF). In all, 5 patients expired, 2 were discharged alive, and 1 remained intubated at the end of the study period.

The purpose of this study was to: (1) evaluate changes in Black student enrollment in colleges of pharmacy, medicine, and dentistry; (2) determine if significant differences exist in Black student enrollment among these colleges; and (3) grade colleges on how well Black student enrollment reflects state populations and compare failing grades between 2010 and 2019.Methods. Enrollment data were obtained through the American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy, Association of American Medical Colleges, and American Dental Association for Fall 2010 through Fall 2019. Average percentage of Black students and rate change was determined. Colleges were graded on their percentage of Black students relative to Black residents in their state. Kruskal-Wallis H test, Wilcoxon signed rank tests, and Chi square tests were performed to quantify differences in enrollment and college grades.Results. Colleges of pharmacy and medicine experienced a significant increase in Black student enrollment between 2010 and 2019, but colleges of dentistry did not. Pharmacy and medicine also had significantly greater Black student enrollment in 2019 compared to dentistry. Proportion of colleges of pharmacy and medicine with failing grades decreased between 2010 and 2019.Conclusion. To facilitate improved access and limit health and health care disparities, it is important health professions colleges reflect the diversity of the patient populations they serve.

83210,,2020,"Several different ways of measuring the energy resolution for meV-resolved inelastic X-ray scattering (IXS) are compared: using scattering from poly(methyl methacrylate), PMMA, using scattering from borosilicate glass (Tempax), and using powder diffraction from aluminium. All of these methods provide a reasonable first approximation to the energy resolution, but, also, in all cases, inelastic contributions appear over some range of energy transfers. Over a range of ±15 meV energy transfer there is good agreement between the measurements of PMMA and Tempax at low temperature, and room-temperature powder diffraction from aluminium, so we consider this to be a good indication of the true resolution of our ∼1.3 meV spectrometer. The resolution over a wider energy range is self-consistently determined using the temperature, momentum and sample dependence of the measured response. The inelastic contributions from the PMMA and Tempax, and their dependence on momentum transfer and temperature, are then quantitatively investigated. The resulting data allow us to determine the resolution of our multi-analyzer array efficiently using a single scan. The importance of this procedure is demonstrated by showing that the results of the analysis of a spectrum from a glass are changed by using the properly deconvolved resolution function. The impact of radiation damage on the scattering from PMMA and Tempax is also discussed.","Ishikawa, Daisuke; Baron, Alfred Q R",Journal of synchrotron radiation,https://doi.org/10.1107/s1600577521003234; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33949988/,728
83452,,2021-05-01,"In biology, it is often critical to determine the identity of an organism and phenotypic traits of interest. Whole-genome sequencing can be useful for this but has limited power for trait prediction. However, we can take advantage of the inherent information content of phenotypes to bypass these limitations. We demonstrate, in clinical and environmental bacterial isolates, that growth dynamics in standardized conditions can differentiate between genotypes, even among strains from the same species. We find that for pairs of isolates, there is little correlation between genetic distance, according to phylogenetic analysis, and phenotypic distance, as determined by growth dynamics. This absence of correlation underscores the challenge in using genomics to infer phenotypes and vice versa. Bypassing this complexity, we show that growth dynamics alone can robustly predict antibiotic responses. These findings are a foundation for a method to identify traits not easily traced to a genetic mechanism.","Zhang, Carolyn; Song, Wenchen; Ma, Helena R; Peng, Xiao; Anderson, Deverick J; Fowler, Vance G; Thaden, Joshua T; Xiao, Minfeng; You, Lingchong",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2008807117; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32747578/,728

84152,,2021-03-01,"UNLABELLED For the treatment of small hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is in some centers considered a first-line therapeutic option. However, such a strategy is still under debate with regard to tumor and patient characteristics. In this single-center study we assessed the 5-year survival and prognosis factors in 235 consecutive patients with cirrhosis (Child-Pugh A/B: 205/30) who received RFA as first-line treatment for up to three HCC <or=5 cm (307 tumors; mean diameter: 29 +/- 10 mm; 53 multinodular forms). Among these patients, 67 satisfied the criteria for resection according to the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer. Complete ablation was obtained in 222 patients (94%). Overall, 337 RFA sessions were performed including iterative RFA for recurrence. Major complications occurred in three patients (0.9%), including one treatment-related death. After 27 +/- 20 months of mean follow-up, local or distant, or both, tumor recurrence occurred in 16, 88, and 11 patients, respectively. Twenty-nine patients underwent transplantation and were removed from the study at this point. Overall 5-year, recurrence-free, and tumor-free (including results of iterative RFA) survival rates were, respectively, 40%, 17%, and 32%. The overall 5-year survival rate was 76% for operable patients. Factors associated with overall survival were prothrombin activity (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.97, 0.96-0.98; P < 0.0001) and serum levels of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) (HR = 1.02, 1.02-1.02; P < 0.0001), and factors associated with tumor recurrence were multinodular forms (HR = 2.34; 1.52-3.6; P = 0.0001) and serum AFP levels (HR = 1.015, 1.014-1.016; P = 0.015). Tumor size was associated with local recurrence but not with overall and tumor-free survival. CONCLUSION RFA is a safe and effective first-line treatment of HCC up to 5 cm in diameter, especially for patients with a single tumor, a low serum AFP level, and well-preserved liver function.","N'Kontchou, Gisèle; Mahamoudi, Amel; Aout, Mounir; Ganne-Carrié, Nathalie; Grando, Véronique; Coderc, Emmanuelle; Vicaut, Eric; Trinchet, Jean Claude; Sellier, Nicolas; Beaugrand, Michel; Seror, Olivier",Hepatology,https://doi.org/10.1002/hep.23181; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19731239/,728

Gelatin-polysuccinat (GP) recently regained attention despite a still unclear risk profile and widely unknown effects on cerebral and peripheral microcirculation. This study investigates the effects of GP versus balanced electrolyte solution (BEL) with focus on cerebral regional oxygen saturation and peripheral microcirculation in a porcine haemorrhagic shock model. METHODS After Animal Care Committee approval haemorrhagic shock was induced by arterial blood withdrawal in 27 anaesthetized pigs. Consequently, the animals received rapid fluid resuscitation by either GP or BEL to replace the removed amount of blood, or remained untreated (n = 3 × 9). Over two hours cerebral regional oxygen saturation by near-infrared spectroscopy and peripheral buccal microcirculation by combined white-light spectrometry and laser-Doppler flowmetry were recorded. Secondary parameters included extended haemodynamics, spirometry, haematological and blood gas parameters. RESULTS Both fluid resuscitation regimes sufficiently stabilized the macro- and microcirculation in haemorrhagic shock with a more pronounced effect following GP infusion. GP administration led to a persisting, critical impairment of cerebral regional oxygen saturation through considerable haemodilution. Survival rates were 100% in both fluid resuscitation groups, but only 33% in the untreated control. CONCLUSION Equal amounts of GP and BEL sufficiently stabilize systemic circulation and microcirculatory perfusion. Forced fluid resuscitation by GP should be applied with caution to prevent haemodilution-induced impairment of cerebral oxygen delivery.","Ziebart, Alexander; Möllmann, Christian; Garcia-Bardon, Andreas; Kamuf, Jens; Schäfer, Moritz; Thomas, Rainer; Hartmann, Erik K","Scandinavian journal of trauma, resuscitation and emergency medicine",https://doi.org/10.1186/s13049-018-0477-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29426350/,728

PATIENTS/METHODS Based on principal-agent theory (PAT), the perspectives of i. the patient (principal) as well as ii. physicians, iii. pharmacists and iv. hospital managers (all agents) were analysed. For the evaluation of the cost-containment and reimbursement strategies of ISA, the German diagnosis-related group (G-DRG) system was used. RESULTS Hospitals individually negotiating additional payments for innovative treatment procedures (zusatzentgelte [ZE]) within the G-DRG system is a key element of hospital management for the reduction of total healthcare expenditure. Our analysis demonstrated the beneficial role of ISA in healthcare resource utilisation, primarily due to a shortened overall length of hospital stay. Depending on underlying disease, coded G-DRG and ISA formulation, large differences in total reimbursement and the amount of ZE was shown. The PAT demonstrated disincentives for hospital managers to use innovative drugs. CONCLUSIONS Based on the PAT, beneficial, detrimental, and indifferent perspectives of different stakeholders regarding the usage of ISA were shown.

87933,,2020-03-31,"Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) causes acute and devastating enteric disease in suckling piglets and results in huge economic losses in the pig industry worldwide. To establish productive infection, viruses must first circumvent the host innate immune response. In this study, we found that PEDV infection stimulated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation, which has been linked to not only anticancer therapeutics, but also antiviral signaling. Therefore, we determined whether EGFR activation affected PEDV infection by using an activator or overexpression assay. The data showed that EGFR activation enhanced virus replication in both cases. We also found that specific inhibition of EGFR by either inhibitors or small interfering RNA (siRNA) led to a decrease in virus yields. Further analysis revealed that inhibition of EGFR produced augmentation of type I interferon genes. We next observed that the EGFR downstream cascade STAT3 was also activated upon PEDV infection. Similar to the case of EGFR, specific inhibition of STAT3 by either inhibitor or siRNA increased the antiviral activity of interferon and resulted in decreased PEDV RNA levels, and vice versa. The data on STAT3 depletion in combination with EGFR activation suggest that the attenuation of antiviral activity by EGFR activation requires activation of the STAT3 signaling pathway. Taken together, these data demonstrate that PEDV-induced EGFR activation serves as a negative regulator of the type I interferon response and provides a novel therapeutic target for virus infection.IMPORTANCE EGFR is a transmembrane tyrosine receptor that mediates various cellular events, as well as several types of human cancers. In this study, we investigated for the first time the role of EGFR in PEDV infection. We observed that PEDV infection induced EGFR activation. The role of EGFR activation is to impair the antiviral activity of type I interferon, which requires the involvement of the EGFR downstream signaling cascade STAT3. Our findings reveal a new mechanism evolved by PEDV to circumvent the host antiviral response, which might serve as a therapeutic target against virus infection.","Yang, Lijun; Xu, Jiayu; Guo, Longjun; Guo, Taijie; Zhang, Lu; Feng, Li; Chen, Hongyan; Wang, Yue",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02095-17; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29386292/,728
88028,,2017,"This review explores recent innovations in four seemingly unrelated areas of medical diagnostics, which, when used concurrently, promise to revolutionize the future of medicine. Novel microfluidics and microelectronics, combined with smartphones, allow individuals to test themselves at anytime and anywhere, thus providing instant health information. An emerging development is the availability of genomic testing directly to consumers for assessing disease predisposition. Some organizations have opened diagnostic laboratories in pharmacies and other public outlets, are encouraging consumers to test themselves, and claim that by doing so consumers will be empowered to diagnose the early disease that could be effectively treated or prevented. Another recent development is the initiation of large studies that aim to better understand wellness and disease processes, through the frequent and sometimes continuous monitoring of hundreds or thousands of parameters. These are then analyzed by health coaches who advise participants on follow-up steps to correct the abnormalities and return to wellness. A number of these approaches have now entered the health market and the services can be purchased. It is highly likely that further technological innovations will contribute to the popularity of these approaches among millions of health-conscious consumers. However, the evidence for the effectiveness of these strategies to prevent or detect early disease, or to promote wellness, does not yet exist.

Seabirds may obtain Hg thousands of kilometers away, during their non-breeding period, and deposit that Hg into their terrestrial breeding colonies. We predicted that Hg concentration in rectrices reflects exposure during the previous breeding season, in body feathers reflects non-breeding exposure, and in blood collected during breeding reflects exposure during current breeding. To test this hypothesis, we measured total Hg concentration in these three tissues, which reflect different timepoints during the annual cycle of rhinoceros auklets (Cerorhinca monocerata) breeding on both sides of the North Pacific (Middleton Island in Alaska and Teuri Island in Hokkaido), and tracked their wintering movement patterns with biologging devices. We (i) identify the wintering patterns of both populations, (ii) examine Hg levels in different tissues representing exposure at different time periods, (iii) test how environmental Hg exposure during the non-breeding season affects bird contamination, and (iv) assess whether variation in Hg levels during the non-breeding season influences levels accumulated in terrestrial plants. Individuals from both populations followed a figure-eight looping migration pattern. We confirm the existence of a pathway from environmental Hg to plant roots via avian tissues, as Hg concentrations were higher in plants within the auklet colonies than at control sites. Hg concentrations of breast feathers were higher in Alaskan than in Japanese auklets, but Hg concentrations in rectrices and blood were similar. Moreover, we found evidence that tissues with different turnover rates could record local anthropogenic Hg emission rates of areas visited during winter. In conclusion, Hg was transported across thousands of kilometers by seabirds and transferred to local plants.","Shoji, Akiko; Elliott, Kyle H; Watanuki, Yutaka; Basu, Niladri; Whelan, Shannon; Cunningham, Joshua; Hatch, Scott; Mizukawa, Hazuki; Nakayama, Shouta M M; Ikenaka, Yoshinori; Ishizuka, Mayumi; Aris-Brosou, Stéphane",Environmental pollution,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2021.117035; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33932830/,728

91032,,2021-03-01,"The global human population is growing at a rapid rate leading to the need for continued expansion of food animal production to meet the world's increasing nutritional requirements. As a consequence of this increased production demand, the use of high volume, animal dense systems have expanded providing high quality protein at reduced costs. Backyard animal production has also expanded. This increased food animal production has facilitated the rapid spread, mutation, and adaptation of pathogens to new hosts. This scenario continues to drive the emergence and reemergence of diseases in livestock species increasing the urgency for development and availability of vaccines for transboundary animal diseases (TADs). Even though vaccines are widely recognized as being an essential tool for control of TADs, there are many scientific, economic, political, and logistical challenges to having vaccine available to control an outbreak. This article will focus on examples of the challenges associated with having vaccines available for emergency response, as well as the characteristics of 'ideal' TAD vaccines, the need for complementary diagnostic assays, and hurdles involved in bringing efficacious veterinary TAD vaccines to market including regulatory constraints and considerations for stockpiling vaccines for emergency use in non-endemic countries.

93660,,2021-02-01,"PURPOSE Vasospasm has been considered the most severe acute complication after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). MRA is not considered ideal for detecting cerebral vasospasm because of background including the hemorrhage. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of Subtraction MRA (SMRA) by comparing it to that of conventional MRA (CMRA) for diagnosis of cerebral vasospasm. METHODS Arteries were assigned to one of three categories based on the degree of MRA diagnostic quality of vasospasm (quality score): 0, bad … 2, good. Furthermore each artery was assigned to one of four categories based on the degree of vasospasm severity (SV score): 0, no vasospasm … 3, severe. The value of the difference between DSA-SV score and MRA-SV score was defined as the DIF score. CMRA and SMRA were compared for each arterial region with regard to quality score and DIF score. RESULTS The average CMRA and SMRA quality score were 1.46 and 1.79; the difference was statistically significant. The average CMRA and SMRA DIF score were 1.08 and .60; the difference was statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS Diagnosis of cerebral vasospasm is more accurate by SMRA than by CMRA. The advantages are its noninvasive nature and its ability to detect cerebral vasospasm.","Hamaguchi, Akiyoshi; Fujima, Noriyuki; Yoshida, Daisuke; Hamaguchi, Naoko; Kodera, Shuichi",Journal of neuroimaging : official journal of the American Society of Neuroimaging,https://doi.org/10.1111/jon.12147; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25040831/,728
93813,,2020-10-01,"BACKGROUND Pulmonary colonization with antibiotic-resistant organisms in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) is often preceded by upper-airway infections. Although there is a well-described relationship between pulmonary respiratory viral infections and overall disease progression of CF, the pathogenicity of respiratory viral infections in the paranasal sinuses of patients with CF remains unknown. With recent advances in respiratory virus detection techniques, this study sought to detect the presence of respiratory viruses in the paranasal sinuses of patients with CF in comparison with healthy controls and to correlate the viral presence with clinical measures of sinonasal disease. METHODS This prospective individual cohort study compared 24 patients with CF with 14 healthy controls. Basic demographics, clinical measures of disease and respiratory viral screens (commercial multiplex) obtained directly from the paranasal sinuses were compared between the two groups. RESULTS Respiratory viruses were detected in 33% of patients with CF (8/24) compared with 0% of the healthy controls (0/14) (p = 0.017). Respiratory viruses were only detected during the winter months, and the most commonly identified were influenza A and human rhinovirus strains. There was no statistical difference in the 22-Item Sino-Nasal Outcome Test (SNOT-22) scores (p = 0.93) or modified Lund-Kennedy scores (p = 0.74) between patients with CF with a positive viral test and those without a positive result. CONCLUSIONS Respiratory viral detection is more commonly detected in the paranasal sinuses of patients with CF compared with healthy controls. Although respiratory viral presence did not correlate with a worse clinical severity of sinonasal disease, these findings may provide insight into the pathophysiology of CF and open new avenues for potential targeted therapy.","Rowan, Nicholas R; Wang, Eric W; Kanaan, Alyssa; Sahu, Nivedita; Williams, John V; Phillips, Caleb D; Lee, Stella E",American journal of rhinology & allergy,https://doi.org/10.2500/ajra.2017.31.4422; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28452706/,728

94361,,2021-04-01,"OBJECT The use of an intracranial stent requires dual antiplatelet therapy to avoid in-stent thrombosis. In this study, the authors sought to investigate whether the use of dual antiplatelet therapy is a risk factor for hemorrhagic complications in patients undergoing permanent ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt for hydrocephalus following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). METHODS Patients were given 325 mg acetylsalicylic acid and 600 mg clopidogrel during the coil/stent procedure, and they were maintained on dual antiplatelet therapy with acetylsalicylic acid 325 mg daily and clopidogrel 75 mg daily during hospitalization and for 6 weeks posttreatment. Patients underwent placement of VP shunt at a later time during initial hospitalization, usually between 7 and 21 days following aSAH. Postoperative CT scans obtained in each study patient were reviewed for hemorrhages related to placement of the VP shunt. RESULTS A total of 206 patients were admitted to the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics with aSAH between July 2009 and October 2010. Thirty-seven of these patients were treated with a VP shunt for persistent hydrocephalus. Twelve patients (32%) had previously undergone stent-assisted coiling and were on dual antiplatelet therapy with acetylsalicylic acid and clopidogrel. The remaining 25 patients (68%) had undergone surgical clipping or aneurysm coiling and were not receiving antiplatelet therapy at the time of surgery. Four cases (10.8%) of new intracranial hemorrhages associated with VP shunt placement were observed. All 4 hemorrhages (33%) occurred in patients on dual antiplatelet therapy for stent-assisted coiling. No new intracranial hemorrhages were observed in patients not receiving dual antiplatelet therapy. The difference in hemorrhagic complications between the 2 groups was statistically significant (4 [33%] of 12 vs 0 of 25, p = 0.0075]). All 4 hemorrhages occurred along the tract of the ventricular catheter. Only 1 hemorrhage (1 [8.3%] of 12) was clinically significant as it resulted in occlusion of the proximal shunt catheter and required revision of the VP shunt. The patient did not suffer any permanent morbidity related to the hemorrhage. The remaining 3 hemorrhages were not clinically significant. CONCLUSIONS This small clinical series suggests that placement of a VP shunt in patients on dual antiplatelet therapy may be associated with an increased, but low, rate of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage. It appears that in patients who are poor candidates for open surgical clipping and have aneurysms amenable to stent-assisted coiling, the risk of symptomatic hemorrhage may be an acceptable trade-off for avoiding risks associated with discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy. The authors' results are preliminary, however, and require confirmation in larger studies.","Mahaney, Kelly B; Chalouhi, Nohra; Viljoen, Stephanus; Smietana, Janel; Kung, David K; Jabbour, Pascal; Bulsara, Ketan R; Howard, Matthew; Hasan, David M",Journal of neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.3171/2013.5.jns122494; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23808537/,728

This study was conducted to present our long-term outcome of VADAs treated with a Tubridge flow diverter (TFD), a new device developed in China. MATERIALS AND METHODS The clinical and angiographic data of six patients harboring large VADAs and treated with TFDs were prospectively collected and analyzed. RESULTS A total of nine TFDs were successfully implanted in six patients. Angiographic follow-up images were available for all patients at a median of 26.0 (18.5, 37.5) months after treatment. Five of the six VADAs were completely occluded, and the last was improved (near complete occlusion). In-stent stenosis was detected in one case and was handled appropriately by angioplasty and stenting. All covered branches and parent arteries remained patent. There were no complications or new neurological deficits observed in any of the patients. At the latest clinical follow-up (36.5 (26.0, 44.5) months), all patients achieved 0 in the modified Rankin scale score. CONCLUSIONS Our preliminary experience suggests that the Tubridge flow diverter might be an alternative treatment for large and recurrent dissecting aneurysms derived from the vertebral artery.","Fang, Y-B; Wen, W-L; Yang, P-F; Zhou, Y; Wu, Y-N; Hong, B; Xu, Y; Zhao, W-Y; Liu, J-M; Huang, Q-H",Clinical neuroradiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00062-015-0494-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26780551/,728
94726,,2020,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Clopidogrel resistance is blamed for thromboembolic complications in neurovascular stent placement. Platelet-function assays are weakly standardized. The aim of this study was to correlate the results of 3 different platelet-inhibition measurements (from light transmission aggregometry, the VerifyNow P2Y12 test, and the Multiplate analyzer) and their relation to periprocedural thromboembolic complications in elective neurovascular stent placement. MATERIALS AND METHODS Clopidogrel resistance was determined on the day of the intervention according to predefined platelet reactivity cutoff values. All 3 tests were performed in 103 consecutive neurovascular stent-placement procedures in 97 patients (extracranial, n = 77; intracranial, n = 26). RESULTS The clopidogrel resistance rates were 47.6% (light transmission aggregometry), 50.5% (VerifyNow), and 35.9% (Multiplate). In 67% of the patients, clopidogrel resistance was present according to at least one method. The correlations of qualitative results that classified a patient as responsive or resistant to clopidogrel were 67.9% for light transmission aggregometry with VerifyNow, 77.7% for light transmission aggregometry with the Multiplate, and 66% for VerifyNow with the Multiplate. Periprocedural thromboembolic complications (n = 9) occurred more frequently in patients who were determined by all 3 methods to be clopidogrel resistant. The difference was most pronounced with light transmission aggregometry (complication rates, 14.4% [clopidogrel-resistant patients] vs 3.7% [clopidogrel-responsive patients]). Sensitivity and specificity rates of clopidogrel resistance in relation to embolic complications were, respectively, 78% and 55% for light transmission aggregometry, 67% and 51% for VerifyNow, and 44% and 67% for the Multiplate. CONCLUSIONS Clopidogrel resistance is a frequent finding in patients who undergo neurovascular stent placement. The correlations among the different testing methods are only modest and differ considerably. Light transmission aggregometry results seem to correlate with thromboembolic complications more accurately than with VerifyNow and Multiplate point-of-care methods.","Flechtenmacher, N; Kämmerer, F; Dittmer, R; Budde, U; Michels, P; Röther, J; Eckert, B",AJNR.

METHODS This study was a retrospective review of 12 free jejunal flaps completed with circular mechanical stapler for the jejunoesophageal anastomosis with comparison to 17 jejunal free flaps where all anastomoses were hand sewn. RESULTS In all, 29 patients underwent free jejunal transfer: 12 had jejunal free flap with circular mechanical stapler for jejunoesophageal anastomosis, whereas 17 patients had hand-sewn anastomosis. Corresponding rates of fistula and stricture were 0/12 fistulas and 3/12 strictures in the stapler cohort and 2/17 fistulas with 0/17 strictures in the hand-sewn cohort. No statistically significant difference in rate of fistula was observed between each cohort, whereas a trend toward increased rate of stricture (p = .06) was observed in the stapled anastomosis cohort.

95752,,2021-02-26,"Policy Points US policymakers considering proposals to expand public health care (such as ""Medicare for all"") as a means of reducing inequalities in health care access and use could learn from the experiences of nations where well-funded universal health care systems are already in place. In England, which has a publicly funded universal health care system, the use of core inpatient services by adults 65 years and older is equal across groups defined by education level, after controlling for health status. However, variation among these groups in the use of outpatient and emergency department care developed between 2010 and 2015, a period of relative financial austerity. Based on England's experience, introducing universal health care in the United States seems likely to reduce, but not entirely eliminate, inequalities in health care use across different population groups. CONTEXT Expanding access to health care is once again high on the US political agenda, as is concern about those who are being ""left behind."" But is universal health care that is largely free at the point of use sufficient to eliminate inequalities in health care use? To explore this question, we studied variation in the use of hospital care among education-level-defined groups of older adults in England, before and after controlling for differences in health status. In England, the National Health Service (NHS) provides health care free to all, but the growth rate for NHS funding has slowed markedly since 2010 during a widespread austerity program, potentially increasing inequalities in access and use. METHODS Novel linkage of data from six waves (2004-2015) of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) with participants' hospital records (Hospital Episode Statistics [HES]) produced longitudinal data for 7,713 older adults (65 years and older) and 25,864 observations. We divided the sample into three groups by education level: low (no formal qualifications), mid (completed compulsory education), and high (at least some higher education). Four outcomes were examined: annual outpatient appointments, elective inpatient admissions, emergency inpatient admissions, and emergency department (ED) visits. We estimated regressions for the periods 2004-2005 to 2008-2009 and 2010-2011 to 2014-2015 to examine whether potential education-related inequalities in hospital use increased after the growth rate for NHS funding slowed in 2010. FINDINGS For the study period, our sample of ELSA respondents in the low-education group made 2.44 annual outpatient visits. In comparison, after controlling for health status, we found that participants in the high-education group made an additional 0.29 outpatient visits annually (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.11-0.47). Additional outpatient health care use in the high-education group was driven by follow-up and routine appointments. This inequality widened after 2010. Between 2010 and 2015, individuals in the high-education group made 0.48 (95% CI, 0.21-0.74) more annual outpatient visits than those in the low-education (16.9% [7.5% to 26.2%] of annual average 2.82 visits). In contrast, after 2010, the high-education group made 0.04 (95% CI, -0.075 to 0.001) fewer annual ED visits than the low-education group, which had a mean of 0.30 annual ED visits. No significant differences by education level were found for elective or emergency inpatient admissions in either period. CONCLUSIONS After controlling for demographics and health status, there was no evidence of inequality in elective and emergency inpatient admissions among the education groups in our sample. However, a period of financial budget tightening for the NHS after 2010 was associated with the emergence of education gradients in other forms of hospital care, with respondents in the high-education group using more outpatient care and less ED care than peers in the low-education group. These estimates point to rising inequalities in the use of hospital care that, if not reversed, could exacerbate existing health inequalities in England. Although the US and UK settings differ in many ways, our results also suggest that a universal health care system would likely reduce inequality in US health care use.","Stoye, George; Zaranko, Ben; Shipley, Martin; McKee, Martin; Brunner, Eric J",The Milbank quarterly,https://doi.org/10.1111/1468-0009.12479; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33022084/,728

We evaluated a new topographical method for endotracheal tube positioning relative to the carina, using a well-known prior topographical method for comparison. METHODS One hundred adult (male 50, female 50) patients were studied. The comparison topographic length (in cm) was measured by adding the distance between the right mouth corner and the right mandibular angle to the distance between the right mandibular angle and the center of the sternal manubrium. The new endotracheal tube insertion depth (in cm) was determined by adding the distance between the right mouth corner and the vocal cords, measured with the endotracheal tube itself, to the distance between the thyroid prominence and the manubriosternal joint, and then subtracting 4 cm. After intubation, the endotracheal tube was positioned properly at the right mouth corner and the endotracheal tube tip was evaluated using a fiberoptic bronchoscope at the carina. RESULTS The distances from the tip of the endotracheal tube to the carina were not significantly different between the methods in the same gender. However, our method allowed endotracheal tube tip placement between 3 cm and 5 cm, above the carina more frequently than the prior method in males.

97157,,2021-02-26,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Stroke thrombolysis is highly time-critical, but data on long-term effects of small reductions in treatment delays have not been available. Our objective was to quantify patient lifetime benefits gained from faster treatment. METHODS Observational prospective data of consecutive stroke patients treated with intravenous thrombolysis in Australian and Finnish centers (1998-2011; n=2258) provided distributions of age, sex, stroke severity, onset-to-treatment times, and 3-month modified Rankin Scale in daily clinical practice. Treatment effects derived from a pooled analysis of thrombolysis trials were used to model the shift in 3-month modified Rankin Scale distributions with reducing treatment delays, from which we derived the expected lifetime and level of long-term disability with faster treatment. RESULTS Each minute of onset-to-treatment time saved granted on average 1.8 days of extra healthy life (95% prediction interval, 0.9-2.7). Benefit was observed in all groups: each minute provided 0.6 day in old severe (age, 80 years; National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale [NIHSS] score, 20) patients, 0.9 day in old mild (age, 80 years; NIHSS score, 4) patients, 2.7 days in young mild (age, 50 years; NIHSS score, 4) patients, and 3.5 days in young severe (age, 50 years; NIHSS score, 20) patients. Women gained slightly more than men over their longer lifetimes. In the whole cohort, each 15 minute decrease in treatment delay provided an average equivalent of 1 month of additional disability-free life. CONCLUSIONS Realistically achievable small reductions in stroke thrombolysis delays would result in significant and robust average health benefits over patients' lifetimes. The awareness of concrete importance of speed could promote practice change.","Meretoja, Atte; Keshtkaran, Mahsa; Saver, Jeffrey L; Tatlisumak, Turgut; Parsons, Mark W; Kaste, Markku; Davis, Stephen M; Donnan, Geoffrey A; Churilov, Leonid",Stroke,https://doi.org/10.1161/strokeaha.113.002910; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24627114/,728
97243,,2018,"OBJECTIVES The underlying pathophysiology of necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) remains incompletely understood, particularly the role of intestinal perfusion. We aimed to determine the relation between cerebral and splanchnic fractional tissue oxygen extraction (FTOE), a marker for tissue underperfusion, with intestinal fatty acid-binding protein in plasma (I-FABPp), a marker for intestinal damage, in infants with NEC. Furthermore, we investigated the combined courses of cerebral and splanchnic FTOE values and I-FABPp levels in uncomplicated (conservative treatment) and complicated NEC (surgery or death). DESIGN This study was part of a prospective observational cohort study. PATIENTS We included 19 preterm infants with NEC (9 uncomplicated, 10 complicated). INTERVENTIONS Using near-infrared spectroscopy, we measured regional cerebral and splanchnic tissue oxygen saturations continuously for 48 h after NEC onset. We measured I-FABPp levels simultaneously. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES We used Spearman correlation tests to calculate correlation coefficients between FTOE values and I-FABPp levels in uncomplicated and complicated NEC. RESULTS Median (range) gestational age was 28 (25-36) weeks and median (range) birth weight was 1290 (740-2400) g. Cerebral and splanchnic FTOE values correlated strongly with I-FABPp levels (rho between .745 and 0.900; p<0.001-0.037) during the first 16 h after NEC onset. Thereafter, in uncomplicated NEC, splanchnic FTOE values increased while I-FABPp levels decreased concomitantly. In complicated NEC both splanchnic FTOE values and I-FABPp levels decreased. CONCLUSIONS Combining cerebral and splanchnic FTOE values with I-FABPp levels, gives insight in the pathological chain of events resulting in progression or recovery of intestinal ischaemia in NEC.

97841,,2021-02-27,"OBJECTIVE To evaluate the maternal serum afamin and vitamin E levels in pregnant women with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and to investigate their association with composite adverse perinatal outcomes. METHODS This prospective, case-control study consisted of 60 pregnant women with COVID-19 infection and 36 age-matched pregnant women without any defined risk factors. Demographic features, laboratory test results, afamin and vitamin E levels were compared between the groups. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to assess the relationship of afamin and vitamin E levels in predicting composite adverse perinatal outcomes. A correlation analysis was performed between afamin and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in pregnant women with COVID-19. RESULTS Obstetric complication rate was higher in the COVID-19 group (13.3% vs 2.8%) (p=0.01). Afamin levels were higher and vitamin E levels were lower in the COVID-19 group (p=0.02, p<0.001, respectively). Vitamin E levels were lower in the COVID-19 group for the all trimesters (p<0.001, p<0.001, p=0.004, respectively). Afamin levels were higher in the COVID-19 group for the all trimesters without reaching statistical significance (p>0.05). The values in ROC curves with the best balance of sensitivity/specificity for afamin and vitamin E were 0.424 mg/l (70.6% sensitivity, 44.3% specificity) and 3.150 µg/ml (76.5% sensitivity, 58.2% specificity), respectively. A positive moderate statistically significant correlation was found between afamin and CRP levels (r= 0.264, p=0.009). CONCLUSION Higher afamin and lower vitamin E levels may support the elevated oxidative stress in the etiopathogenesis of COVID-19 and the relationship with composite adverse perinatal outcomes.

98028,,2020-11-16,"OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to investigate the interrater reliability and intrarater reliability of the flexor pollicis longus muscle stretch reflex (FPLR) and compare it with clinically established reflexes. DESIGN A total of 71 healthy volunteers participated. The FPLR, biceps reflex, brachioradialis reflex, and patellar tendon reflex of each participant were tested bilaterally and rated by eight examiners (four experienced, four inexperienced). For intrarater reliability evaluation, five examiners rated the reflexes of four volunteers at four different points in time. RESULTS Analysis of the interrater reliability with Gwet's AC1 demonstrated almost perfect agreement for FPLR (Gwet's AC1 = 0.90), biceps reflex (Gwet's AC1 = 0.90), and patellar tendon reflex (Gwet's AC1 = 0.95) when using binary data (reflex present vs. absent). Only fair agreement was found for the brachioradialis reflex (Gwet's AC1 = 0.56). Experienced raters had a higher agreement than inexperienced raters did when rating the biceps reflex and the patellar tendon reflex. The intrarater reliability was almost perfect for the patellar tendon reflex (Gwet's AC1 = 0.94), followed by the FPLR (Gwet's AC1 = 0.83) with substantial agreement and the biceps reflex (Gwet's AC1 = 0.57) with moderate agreement. CONCLUSION The FPLR is a reliable diagnostic neuromuscular test and may therefore be useful in the clinical examination for C8/T1 nerve root lesions or pathologies of the interosseous anterior nerve.

98379,,2020-11-01,"Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become global pandemic and resulted in considerable morbidity and mortality since December 2019. Information on the incidence of myocardial injury remains scarce. Methods English-language databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane), Chinese-language databases (CNKI, VIP, WANFANG), and preprint platform were searched to identify studies that reported the myocardial injury data in COVID-19 patients. Random-effects meta-analyses were used to derive the pooled incidence and relative risks (RRs) of myocardial injury. Variations by disease severity were examined by subgroup analyses. Sensitivity analyses were performed to strengthen the results. Meta-regression was applied to explore the risk factors associated with myocardial injury. Results A total of 53 studies involving 7,679 patients were included. The pooled incidence of myocardial injury was 21% [95% confidence interval (CI), 17-25%; I2, 96.5%]. The highest incidence of myocardial injury was found in non-survivors (66%; 95 CI%, 54-78%; I2, 85.7%), followed by severe patients (43%; 95 CI%, 33-53%; I2, 93.0%) and non-severe patients (11%; 95 CI%, 7-15%; I2, 95.2%). Higher risk of myocardial injury was detected in severe patients than non-severe patients (RR, 5.74; 95% CI, 3.74-8.79; I2, 86.8%). All the sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of primacy results. Conclusions This meta-analysis showed that myocardial injury occurred in 21% of COVID-19 patients. An elevated rate was observed in non-survivors (66%) and severe patients (43%). Severe patients had a 4.74-fold increase in the risk of myocardial injury than non-severe patients. Aggressive strategy may be considered for COVID-19 patients at high risk of myocardial injury.","Gu, Zhi-Chun; Zhang, Chi; Kong, Ling-Cong; Shen, Long; Li, Zheng; Ge, Heng; Lin, Hou-Wen; Pu, Jun",Cardiovascular diagnosis and therapy,https://doi.org/10.21037/cdt-20-535; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32968623/,728

99929,,2021-04-01,"BACKGROUND Hyperinflammation and cytokine release has been associated with severe Covid-19. Hemadsorption cartridges may have a potential role in treatment of cytokine storm associated with the development of severe Covid-19. METHODS We retrospectively examined the case records of patients with severe Covid-19 receiving adjunctive hemadsorption (HA) in our ICU. We analyzed inflammatory biomarkers pre- and post- HA. RESULTS Fifteen patients received HA during the study period. All were intubated, ventilated and required renal replacement therapy. 11/15 were supported on ECMO. Mean ferritin 2652 (±3286) ng/ml, mean CRP 154 (±92) mg/ml, median D-dimer 3071 (±2689) ng/ml, mean troponin 236 (±461) ng/L. We found significant difference in pre-and post- treatment ferritin 3622 ng/ml versus 1682 ng/ml (p = 0.022), CRP 222 mg/ml versus 103 mg/ml (p = 0.008, 95% CI 22.4-126.5), lactate 2 mmol/L versus 1.3 mmol/L (p = 0.017), and procalcitonin 15.3 ng/ml versus 4.2 ng/ml (p = 0.023). No significant difference in pre- and post- treatment IL-6 14 pg/ml versus 43 pg/ml (p = 0.32), IL-10 3.4 pg/ml versus 2.6 pg/ml (p = 0.31), IL1 β 0.37 pg/ml versus 0.77 pg/ml (p = 0.75), TNF α 12.77 pg/ml versus 12.49 pg/ml (p = 0.75), VIS 10.04 versus 6.01 (p = 0.31, 95% CI 5.98-17.16) was seen. CONCLUSIONS The use of HA as adjunctive treatment in a critically unwell group of COVID-19 patients lead to a reduction in ferritin, CRP, procalcitonin and lactate with no significant change in other parameters. The use of HA in the treatment of severe COVID-19 requires further larger randomized studies.","Paisey, Christopher; Patvardhan, Chinmay; Mackay, Michael; Vuylsteke, Alain; Bhagra, Sai Kiran",The International journal of artificial organs,https://doi.org/10.1177/03913988211023782; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34128416/,728
100012,,2021-06-08,"Poly(A) tail length is emerging as an important marker of mRNA fate, where deviations from the canonical length can signal degradation or nuclear retention of transcripts. Pathways regulating polyadenylation thus have the potential to broadly influence gene expression. Here we demonstrate that accumulation of cytoplasmic poly(A) binding protein (PABPC) in the nucleus, which can occur during viral infection or other forms of cellular stress, causes mRNA hyperadenylation and nuclear accumulation of poly(A) RNA. This inhibits gene expression but does not affect mRNA stability. Unexpectedly, PABPC-induced hyperadenylation can occur independently of mRNA 3'-end processing yet requires the canonical mRNA poly(A) polymerase II. We find that nuclear PABPC-induced hyperadenylation is triggered by multiple divergent viral factors, suggesting that altering the subcellular localization of PABPC may be a commonly used mechanism to regulate cellular gene expression in a polyadenylation-linked manner.","Kumar, G Renuka; Glaunsinger, Britt A",Molecular and cellular biology,https://doi.org/10.1128/mcb.00600-10; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20823266/,728

100102,,2021-08-23,"OBJECTIVE To explore the relationship between intrauterine device (IUD) use and risk of ovarian cancer through systematic review of the literature and meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Web of Science Core Collection from inception to June 2018. For the MEDLINE search, we included the MeSH terms ""intrauterine devices"" AND ""ovarian neoplasms,"" however also searching ""intrauter*,"" ""ovar*"" and ""fallopian tube,"" as well as ""cancer"" and ""carcinoma"" as keywords to include all possible variations. Similar search terms were used in the other databases. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov. METHODS OF STUDY SELECTION Case-control and cohort studies that collected individual level data on IUD use and ovarian cancer diagnosis were critically reviewed and data extracted. Review of abstracts from 399 articles through systematic database review and an additional 200 articles through Google Scholar identified a total of 15 studies with individual level data regarding IUD use and incident ovarian cancer. On critical review, 11 of these studies were used for meta-analysis. All case reports and reviews were excluded. TABULATION, INTEGRATION, AND RESULTS The data were harmonized and weighted and summary odds ratios (ORs) were calculated. Covariates were identified evaluated separately. A random-effects meta-analysis was performed to confirm minimal bias. Harmonization and weighting of the data revealed an OR association between ever use of an IUD and incident ovarian cancer to be 0.68 (95% CI 0.62-0.75). There were no significant differences found between covariates. Heterogeneity among all studies was found to be I=68%. CONCLUSION Intrauterine device use is associated with a reduced incidence of ovarian cancer based on a review of existing retrospective data. Unfortunately, prospective investigation into the role of IUDs in ovarian cancer prevention is limited.","Wheeler, Lindsay J; Desanto, Kristen; Teal, Stephanie B; Sheeder, Jeanelle; Guntupalli, Saketh R",Obstetrics and gynecology,https://doi.org/10.1097/aog.0000000000003463; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31503144/,728
100294,,2021-05-01,"PURPOSE This paper aims to investigate the Portuguese general public views regarding the criteria that should guide critical COVID-19 patients to receive medical devices (ventilators and IUC beds) during the current pandemic context. Based on rationing principles and protocols proposed in ethical and medical literature the authors explore how Portuguese general public evaluates the fairness of five allocation principles: ""prognosis"", ""severity of health condition"", ""patients age"", ""instrumental value"" (frontline healthcare professionals should be prioritized during the pandemic) and ""lottery"". DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH An online questionnaire was used to collect data from a sample of 586 Portuguese citizens. Descriptive statistics and non-parametric tests were used to define a hierarchy of prioritization criteria and to test for the association between respondents support to them and their socio-demographic and health characteristics. FINDINGS Respondents gave top priority to prognosis when faced with absolute scarcity, followed closely by the severity of health condition, patient's age with instrumental value receiving lowest support, on average. However, when the age of the patients was confronted with survival, younger-first principle prevailed over recovery. In a pandemic context, lottery was considered the least fair allocation method. The findings suggest that respondents' opinions are aligned with those of ethicists but are partially in disagreement with the protocol suggested for Portugal.

100792,,2021-01-01,"BACKGROUND This longitudinal study describes the associations between respiratory viral infections, rhinitis and the prevalence and density of the common nasopharyngeal bacterial colonisers, S. pneumoniae, M. catarrhalis, H. influenzae and S. aureus. METHODS In an observational cohort study, 161 children attending day-care-centres in Bristol, UK were recruited. Monthly nasopharyngeal swabs were taken and stored frozen in STGG broth. qPCR was used for detection of respiratory viruses and four bacterial species. T-tests and logistic regression models were used for analysis. RESULTS The frequent colonisers, S. pneumoniae(Sp), M. catarrhalis(Mc) and H. influenzae(Hi) were more frequently found at high density in contrast to S. aureus although temporally, high density carriage was short lived. Respiratory viral infections and symptoms of rhinitis were both independently and consistently associated with higher bacterial density with an observed twofold increase in density for Sp, Mc and Hi (p= 0.004 - 0.017). CONCLUSION For Sp and Hi, the association between young age and higher bacterial DNA density was explained by more frequent viral infection and increased nasal discharge while the associations between some viral species and some bacterial species' density appear to be stronger than others. Increased colonisation density and rhinitis may promote transmission of these commonly carried organisms.","Thors, Valtyr; Christensen, Hannah; Morales-Aza, Begonia; Oliver, Elizabeth; Sikora, Paulina; Vipond, Ian; Muir, Peter; Finn, Adam",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,https://doi.org/10.1097/inf.0000000000002256; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30489465/,728
100856,,2020-05-26,"PURPOSE Surgery-induced factors such as postoperative infectious complications (PICs) and intraoperative blood loss (IBL) have a negative impact on the survival of patients undergoing surgery for gastric cancer. A recent study showed that neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) could reduce the negative impact of PICs; hence, we conducted the present study to investigate if NAC can also reduce the negative prognostic impact of IBL. METHODS We reviewed 115 gastric cancer patients treated with NAC and radical gastrectomy. The cut-off for IBL predicting the long-term survival was assessed by a receiver operating characteristic curve. The Cox proportional hazard model was used to evaluate the association between patient characteristics including IBL, overall survival, and disease-free survival. RESULTS The cut-off for IBL was set at 990 ml. Twenty-six patients had excessive IBL exceeding 990 ml (22.6%) and PICs developed in 33 patients (28.7%). The body mass index, IBL, ypT, and ypN were significant independent prognostic predictors, but PICs were not. CONCLUSION NAC did not decrease the risk induced by excessive IBL. The prophylactic effect of NAC on surgery-induced risk was inconsistent.","Hayashi, Masato; Yoshikawa, Takaki; Yura, Masahiro; Otsuki, Sho; Yamagata, Yukinori; Morita, Shinji; Katai, Hitoshi; Nishida, Toshirou",Surgery today,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00595-020-02114-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32839832/,728
100975,,2020,"Toxoplasma gondii, the etiological agent of toxoplasmosis, can cause serious public health problems. Although Toxoplasma gondii tends more to neurotropic and ocular organs, some existing evidence suggest that this disease might induce serious pathological effects on liver. Hence, this study aimed to evaluate the relationship between chronic liver diseases and toxoplasmosis. Meanwhile, it attempted to assess whether patients with toxoplasmosis are susceptible to chronic liver diseases. To achieve this aim, the published studies related to the subject were systematically searched in five major electronic databases between the January 1, 1950 and October 1, 2019. The meta-analysis was carried out using the StatsDirect statistical software and a p-value less than 0.05 was considered significant for any test. Out of 691 identified studies, 10 studies met our inclusion criteria and entered this systematic review. The pooled prevalence rates of Toxoplasma gondii in patients with liver diseases (35.97%; 95% CI: 28.38-43.93) were higher than those in the control group (18.24%; 95% CI: 13.85-23.09). The meta-analysis indicated that the common Odd Ratio by a random effect model was 2.7 (95% CI: 2.30-3.24), revealing a significant association between chronic liver diseases and anti-Toxoplasma IgG antibody.

101023,,2021-03-09,"Coronaviruses (CoVs) possess an enveloped, single, positive-stranded RNA genome which encodes for four membrane proteins, namely spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins 3-5 [1]. With regard to pathogenicity, S proteins are essential for viral entry into host cells [2, 3]. SARS-CoV binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)2 which is present on nonimmune cells, such as respiratory and intestinal epithelial cells, endothelial cells, kidney cells (renal tubules) and cerebral neurons and immune cells, such as alveolar monocytes/macrophages [4-6]. Of note, CD209L or liver/lymph node special intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing non-integrin (SIGN) and dendritic cell (DC)-SIGN are alternative receptors for SARS-CoV but with lower affinity [7]. In the case of MERS-CoV, S proteins bind to the host cell receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4 or CD26) which is broadly expressed on intestinal, alveolar, renal, hepatic and prostate cells as well as on activated leukocytes [8]. Then, viruses replicate in target cells with release of mature virions, which, in turn, invade new target cells [9]. Evidence has been provided that SARSCoV proteins are cleaved into two subunits, S1 and S2, respectively, and the amino acids 318-510 of the S1 represent the receptor-binding domain (RBD) which binds to ACE2 [10, 11]. Quite importantly, in the context of RBD there is the receptor-binding motif (RBM) (amino acids 424- 494), which accounts for complete binding to ACE2 [11]. Moreover, by means of two residues at positions 479 and 487 RBD allows virus progression and tropism [10, 11]. In the case of MERSCoV, its RBM binds to DPP4 with residues 484-567, thus, suggesting that its RBD differs from that of SARS-CoV [12, 13]. In a very recent paper, Wan and associates [14] have investigated the receptor recognition by COVID-19 (a new term to indicate the 2019-nCoV in Wuhan) on the bases of structural studies. In this respect, the sequence of COVID-19 RBM is similar to that of SARSCoV, thus, implicating that ACE2 may represent the binding receptors for COVID-19. Furthermore, gln493 residue of COVID-19 RBM seems to allow interaction with human ACE2, thus, suggesting the ability of this virus to infect human cells. According, to Wan and associates structural analysis [14], COVID-19 binds to human ACE2 with a lesser efficiency than human SARS-CoV (2002) but with higher affinity than human SARS-CoV (2003). Furthermore, same authors predicted that a single mutation at the 501 position may enhance the COVID-19 RBD binding capacity to human ACE2 and this evolution should be monitored in infected patients [14]. These predictive findings by Wan and associates [14] are confirmed by two contemporary studies by Letko and Muster [15] and Peng and associates [16]. In particular, the report by Peng and associates [16], points out the possible origin of COVID-19 from bats [16]. From a pathogenic point of view, evidence has been provided that binding of S2 to ACE2 receptor leads to its down-regulation with subsequent lung damage in the course of SARS-CoV infection [17]. Down-regulation of ACE2 causes excessive production of angiotensin (ANG) II by the related enzyme ACE with stimulation of ANG type 1a receptor (AT1R) and enhanced lung vascular permeability [18]. In particular, same authors have reported that recombinant ACE2 could attenuate severe acute lung injury in mice [18]. Moreover, Battle and associates [19] also proposed to use already available recombinant ACE2 for intercepting COVID-19 and attenuating infection. In the previous paragraphs, the presence of ACE2 on immune cells has been pointed out and, by analogy to epithelial cells, this receptor may also be down-regulated following viral entry. Therefore, in CoV-infected animal models and in infected humans further investigations are required to clarify a possible reduced expression of ACE2 on immune cells. In fact, in the course of SARS-CoV infection, a number of immune disorders have been detected. Three reports have demonstrated the ability of CoV to inhibit interferon (IFN)- production in the course of SARS acting as IFN antagonist [20-22]. In senescent Balb/c mice, depletion of T lymphocytes is associated to more severe interstitial pneumonitis and delayed clearance of SARS-CoV, thus, suggesting a protective role played by these cells [23]. In this connection, both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have been shown to induce T cell apoptosis, thus, aggravating the clinical course of disease [24, 25]. Quite interestingly, memory CD8+ T cells specific for SARS-CoV M and N proteins have been detected up to 11 years post-infection [26]. As far as humoral immune responsiveness is concerned, evidence has been provided that S1 subunit from MERS-CoV is highly immunogenic in mice [27]. Moreover, monoclonal antibodies have been shown to be highly neutralizing against MERS-CoV replication and endowed with post exposure effectiveness in susceptible mice [28, 29]. Human neutralizing antibodies have also been isolated from a recovered patient, thus, suggesting the role of humoral immunity in the control of the persistence of CoV in the host [30]. In particular, IgG response occurs early in infection and its prolonged production may serve for virus clearance during recovery also in view of the absence of viremia in convalescent sera from SARS patients [31]. According to current literature, severity of COVID-19 infection correlates with lymphopenia and patients who died from COVID-19 had lower lymphocyte counts when compared to survivors [32, 33]. These data suggest that lymphocyte-mediated anti-viral activity is poorly effective against COVID-19. Despite lymphopenia, evidence for an exaggerate release of proinflammatory cytokines [interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-6] has been reported in the course acute respiratory syndrome in COVID19 infected patients, thus, aggravating the clinical course of disease [34]. As recently reported, during COVID-19 pandemic in both Italy and China higher frequency of fatalities have been observed in the frail elderly population with previous comorbidities [35]. It is well known that decline of immunity occurs in ageing and, therefore, COVID-19 may gain easier access to the respiratory tract in frail elderly patients [36]. There is evidence that ACE2 protects from severe acute lung failure and operates as a negative regulator of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) [18, 37]. It is well known that ANG II via activation of the AT1R promotes detrimental effects on the host, such as, vasoconstriction, reactive oxygen species generation, inflammation and matrix remodelling [38]. ACE2 counterbalances the noxious effects exhibited by ANG II and AT1R via activation of AT2R which arrests cell growth, inflammation and fibrosis [39]. In this framework, Gurwitz [40] proposed to use AT1R blockers, such as losartan, as a potential treatment of COVID-19 infection. In fact, losartan as well as olmesartan, used for treating hypertension in patients, were able to increase ACE2 expression after 28 days treatment of rats with myocardial infarction [41]. Then, Gurwitz suggests to evaluate severity of symptoms in COVID-19 infected patients under previous chronic treatment with AT1R blockers in comparison to COVID-19 infected patients who did not take AT1R blockers [40]. Quite interestingly, 75% of aged COVID-19 infected patients admitted to Italian hospitals had hypertension [unpublished data]. However, the putative effects of ACE-2 down-regulation on the cardiovascular system in the course of COVID-19 pandemic need more intensive studies. Taken together, these evidences suggest that CoV-induced down-regulation of ACE2 activates RAS with collateral damage to organs, such as lungs, in the course of SARS-related pneumonia. Then, putative therapeutic measures aimed at increasing ACE2 levels on respiratory epithelial cells should be taken into serious consideration. Quite interestingly, over the past few years, three key papers have demonstrated the ability of a polyphenol, resveratrol (RES), to experimentally deactivate the RAS system in maternal and post-weaning high fat diet, arterial ageing and high fat diet, respectively [42-44]. In all these experimental models, RES led to an increase of ACE2 with reduction of organ damage, such as liver steatosis and aorta media thickness and decrease of adipose tissue mass, respectively. As far as the mechanism of action of RES is concerned, this polyphenol is able to activate sirtuin (Sirt)1 [45-47]. In turn, Sirt1 down-regulates AT1R expression via ACE2 up-regulation [43, 48]. Of importance, Lin and associates [48] have demonstrated the ability of RES to in vitro inhibit MERS-CoV infection of Vero E6 cells, thus, prolonging cell survival in virtue of an anti-apoptotic mechanism. These findings suggest a direct antiviral effect exerted by RES. It would be very interestingly to evaluate the direct effects of RES on COVID-19, in vitro. The data above discussed strongly suggest, that RES, as an activators of ACE2, should be investigated in animal models of CoV-induced severe pneumonia, also taking into account the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating effects exerted by polyphenols [49]. Then, successful animal studies may pave the way for RES-based human trials in COVID-infected patients. Note added in proof During the reviewing process of this perspective other related papers have been published. Hanff and associates [50] have discussed the possible association between COVID-19-associated cardiovascular mortality and dysregulation of the Renin Angiotensin System (RAS). From a pharmacologic point of view, RAS inhibition leads to upregulation of ACE2, thus, attenuating acute respiratory syndrome and myocarditis in COVID-19-infected patients. Conversely, increase in ACE2 expression may facilitate the access into the host of COVID-19, thus, aggravating the clinical picture. Such a dilemma would be solved by clinical trials based on RAS blo","Magrone, Thea; Magrone, Manrico; Jirillo, Emilio","Endocrine, metabolic & immune disorders drug targets",https://doi.org/10.2174/1871530320666200427112902; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32338224/,728

(1989) to reflect on the complex narrative structures and temporalities of epidemics as they are experienced and storied. We begin with an analysis of Rosenberg's use of Albert Camus's The Plague and a discussion of how epidemics have been modeled in literature and in epidemiology concomitantly. Then, we argue that Charles Rosenberg's characterization of epidemics as events bounded in time that display narrative and epidemiological purity fails to account for the reinvention of life within health crises. Adopting the ecological, archaeological, and anthropological perspectives developed within African studies enriches the range of available plots, roles, and temporal sequences and ultimately transforms our way of depicting epidemics. Instead of events oriented toward their own closure, epidemics might be approached as unsettling, seemingly endless periods during which life has to be recomposed.","Lachenal, Guillaume; Thomas, Gaëtan",Bulletin of the history of medicine,https://doi.org/10.1353/bhm.2020.0089; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33775946/,728

The present study described the frequency and types of different infectious etiologies among hospitalized patients with SARI in Tianjin, China, during 2015 and 2016. Basic information, in addition to a throat or serum sample, was collected from SARI patients. Nine viruses were detected using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae was detected using the Serodia Myco II gelatin particle agglutination test. A total of 585 specimens from 2,290 SARI cases were collected. The most common infection (19.66%, 115/585) was M. pneumoniae, followed by influenza virus A/B (6.15%, 36/585), and respiratory syncytial virus (4.96%, 29/585). Identification of viral or M. pneumoniae infections was the highest in the pediatric medicine ward (74.84%, 119/159), followed by the intensive care unit (37.04%, 80/216) and respiratory medicine ward (34.29%, 72/210). M. pneumoniae was highest (38.71%, 24/62) in the 5-14-year age group. Influenza was the main infection in January 2015 and March 2016. The correlation coefficient for the proportion of hospitalized cases of SARI and the positive detection rate within the same week was 0.25. M. pneumoniae and influenza were the leading pathogens among hospitalized SARI patients. A continued surveillance of hospitalized cases of SARI can detect emerging diseases, such as avian influenza A (H7N9) virus and other respiratory disease outbreaks.","Xu, Wenti; Guo, Liru; Dong, Xiaochun; Li, Xiaoxia; Zhou, Penghui; Ni, Qiang; Zhou, Xinying; Wagner, Abram L; Li, Lin",Japanese journal of infectious diseases,https://doi.org/10.7883/yoken.jjid.2017.412; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29491245/,728
102013,,2021-03-01,"Influenza A virus (IAV) is a major human pathogen whose genotypic diversity results in unpredictable pandemics and epidemics. Interaction with the cell nucleus is essential to IAV infection, allowing recruitment of cellular components to facilitate virus replication. Viral proteins are also targeted to the nucleolus, a subnuclear structure involved in ribosomal biogenesis, RNA maturation, stress response, and control of cell growth, but the functional consequences of this are unclear. We took an unbiased approach to studying IAV-nucleolar interactions by using stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) in conjunction with LC-MS/MS to quantify changes in the nucleolar proteome following infection with A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) and A/Udorn/72 (H3N2) strains of the virus. Only a minority of nucleolar proteins showed significant changes in abundance after infection; these alterations were mostly different between the two strains but could be validated by confocal microscopy of infected cells. Many of the affected proteins comprised functional groupings, including components of ribonuclease P, RNA polymerase I, the MLL1 histone methyltransferase complex, as well as nuclear paraspeckles and the RNA editing apparatus. This, as well as comparison with other viruses that cause changes in the nucleolar proteome, suggests that IAV targets specific nucleolar pathways.","Emmott, Edward; Wise, Helen; Loucaides, Eva M; Matthews, David A; Digard, Paul; Hiscox, Julian A",Journal of proteome research,https://doi.org/10.1021/pr100593g; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20701360/,728
102071,,2018,"BACKGROUND Studies have shown sex-based disparities in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) management and prognosis. We sought to compare women and men undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for STEMI in a large, prospective, contemporary context. METHODS The Harmonizing Outcomes with Revascularization and Stents in Acute Myocardial Infarction (HORIZONS-AMI) trial randomized 3,602 patients (23.4% women and 76.6% men) with STEMI presenting within 12 hr of onset of symptoms to bivalirudin or heparin plus glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors and to PCI with drug-eluting or bare metal stents. RESULTS Compared with men, women presented later after symptom onset and were more often treated with medical management alone (6.9% vs. 4.7%; P = 0.01). Women had significantly higher rates of 3-year major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and major bleeding. After adjusting for baseline differences, female sex remained an independent predictor of major bleeding (hazard ratio [HR] 1.81, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.41-2.33; P < 0.0001) but not of MACE (HR 1.09; 95% CI 0.91-1.32; P = 0.35). CONCLUSIONS This study found that women with STEMI are at increased risk of bleeding as compared to men. While female sex may not directly contribute to increased risk of MACE, it is, however, associated with the presence of comorbidities that increase the risk of ischemic events long-term.

We present 13 patients with spinal epidural arteriovenous fistulas, noting the various presenting symptom patterns, imaging findings related to bone involvement, and outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS Among 111 patients with spinal vascular malformations in the institutional data base from 1993 to 2017, thirteen patients (11.7%) had spinal epidural arteriovenous fistulas. We evaluated presenting symptoms and imaging findings, including bone involvement and mode of treatment. To assess the treatment outcome, we compared initial and follow-up clinical status using the modified Aminoff and Logue Scale of Disability and the modified Rankin Scale. RESULTS The presenting symptoms were lower back pain (n = 2), radiculopathy (n = 5), and myelopathy (n = 7). There is overlap of symptoms in 1 patient (No. 11). Distribution of spinal epidural arteriovenous fistulas was cervical (n = 3), thoracic (n = 2), lumbar (n = 6), and sacral (n = 2). Intradural venous reflux was identified in 7 patients with congestive venous myelopathy. The fistulas were successfully treated in all patients who underwent treatment (endovascular embolization, n = 10; operation, n = 1) except 2 patients who refused treatment due to tolerable symptoms. Transarterial glue (n = 7) was used in nonosseous types; and transvenous coils (n = 3), in osseous type. After 19 months of median follow-up, the patients showed symptom improvement after treatment. CONCLUSIONS Although presenting symptoms were diverse, myelopathy caused by intradural venous reflux was the main target of treatment. Endovascular treatment was considered via an arterial approach in nonosseous types and via a venous approach in osseous types.","Song, Y; Cho, S H; Lee, D W; Sheen, J J; Shin, J H; Suh, D C",AJNR.

However, excessive cerebral IFN-I levels leads to pathologies, suggesting the need for tight regulation of responses. Based on data from mouse models, human HSE cases, and primary cell culture systems, we here show that microglia and other immune cells undergo apoptosis in the HSV-1-infected brain through a mechanism dependent on the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) - stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway, but independent of IFN-I. HSV-1 infection of microglia induced cGAS-dependent apoptosis at high viral doses, while lower viral doses led to IFN-I responses. Importantly, inhibition of caspase activity prevented microglial cell death and augmented IFN-I responses. Accordingly, HSV-1-infected organotypic brain slices, or mice treated with caspase inhibitor, exhibited lower viral load and improved outcome of infection. Collectively, we identify an activation-induced apoptosis program in brain immune cells which down-modulates local immune responses.","Reinert, Line S; Rashidi, Ahmad S; Tran, Diana N; Katzilieris-Petras, Georgios; Hvidt, Astrid K; Gohr, Mette; Fruhwürth, Stefanie; Bodda, Chiranjeevi; Thomsen, Martin K; Vendelbo, Mikkel H; Khan, Ahmad Raza; Hansen, Brian; Bergström, Petra; Agholme, Lotta; Mogensen, Trine H; Christensen, Maria H; Nyengaard, Jens R; Sen, Ganes C; Zetterberg, Henrik; Verjans, Georges Mgm; Paluden, Soren R",The Journal of clinical investigation,https://doi.org/10.1172/jci136824; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32990676/,728

105149,,2020-08-01,"INTRODUCTION Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is gaining acceptance as a stand-alone bariatric procedure with proven efficacy on weight loss and obesity-related comorbidities. A specific and potentially severe complication of LSG is the staple line leak (SLL). Our aim was to report the SLL rate and its management in a prospective cohort of 378 LSGs. PATIENTS AND METHODS A total of 378 patients underwent LSG from July 2005 to July 2011. The gastric transection was performed by an initial 60 mm firing of 4.5 mm staples at the antrum and successive 60 mm firings of 3.5 mm staples at the gastric body and fundus toward the left diaphragmatic crus. A 36 Fr bougie was used to calibrate the gastric tube. The staple line was systematically reinforced with a partial-thickness running suture. RESULTS The overall complications and SLL rate were 20/378 (5.29%) and 9/378 (2.38%), respectively. SLLs were managed by laparoscopic (n=2) or open (n=1) exploration, drainage and endoscopic self-expandable covered stent, computed tomography-guided percutaneous drainage (n=2), or a self-expandable covered stent alone (n=4). Medical support including total parenteral nutrition and adapted antibiotics was started in all patients. The combined treatment modalities were successful in all cases. CONCLUSIONS SLL was the most common complication of LSG accounting for half of the overall complications. Percutaneous drainage and self-covered stents combined with antibiotics and parenteral nutrition are effective for SLL and should be proposed as first-line treatment in stable patients.","Vix, Michel; Diana, Michele; Marx, Ludovic; Callari, Cosimo; Wu, Hurng-Sheng; Perretta, Silvana; Mutter, Didier; Marescaux, Jacques","Surgical laparoscopy, endoscopy & percutaneous techniques",https://doi.org/10.1097/sle.0000000000000026; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24752161/,728

Moreover, the number of deaths is going to increase over the next few months until the pandemic comes to an end, and a second wave has also been reported in few countries. Most interestingly, the death rate among certain populations from the same COVID-19 infection is highly variable. For instance, the European populations show a very high death rate, in contrast to the populations from Chinese ethnicities. Amongst all the closed cases with an outcome (total recovered + total died), the death rate in Italy is 13%, Iran is 6%, China is 5%, Brazil is 3%, The United States of America is 2%, India 2%, Israel is 1% as of October 08, 2020.

The greater the infectivity to severity ratio, the better the disease outcome with the value of 1 being the worst disease outcome.

However, no genomic data are available from modern-day France, where both routes converged, as evidenced by a mosaic cultural pattern. Here, we present genome-wide data from 101 individuals from 12 sites covering today's France and Germany from the Mesolithic (N = 3) to the Neolithic (N = 98) (7000-3000 BCE). Using the genetic substructure observed in European hunter-gatherers, we characterize diverse patterns of admixture in different regions, consistent with both routes of expansion. Early western European farmers show a higher proportion of distinctly western hunter-gatherer ancestry compared to central/southeastern farmers. Our data highlight the complexity of the biological interactions during the Neolithic expansion by revealing major regional variations.","Rivollat, Maïté; Jeong, Choongwon; Schiffels, Stephan; Küçükkalıpçı, İşil; Pemonge, Marie-Hélène; Rohrlach, Adam Benjamin; Alt, Kurt W; Binder, Didier; Friederich, Susanne; Ghesquière, Emmanuel; Gronenborn, Detlef; Laporte, Luc; Lefranc, Philippe; Meller, Harald; Réveillas, Hélène; Rosenstock, Eva; Rottier, Stéphane; Scarre, Chris; Soler, Ludovic; Wahl, Joachim; Krause, Johannes; Deguilloux, Marie-France; Haak, Wolfgang",Science advances,https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aaz5344; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32523989/,728
108370,,2020-12-03,"Fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) is a powerful tool used to connect changes in gut microbial composition with a variety of disease states and pathologies. While FMT enables potential causal relationships to be identified, the experimental details reported in preclinical FMT protocols are highly inconsistent and/or incomplete. This limitation reflects a current lack of authoritative guidance on reporting standards that would facilitate replication efforts and ultimately reproducible science. We therefore systematically reviewed all FMT protocols used in mouse models with the goal of formulating recommendations on the reporting of preclinical FMT protocols. Search strategies were applied across three databases (PubMed, EMBASE, and Ovid Medline) until June 30, 2020. Data related to donor attributes, stool collection, processing/storage, recipient preparation, administration, and quality control were extracted. A total of 1753 papers were identified, with 241 identified for data extraction and analysis. Of the papers included, 92.5% reported a positive outcome with FMT intervention. However, the vast majority of studies failed to address core methodological aspects including the use of anaerobic conditions (91.7% of papers lacked information), storage (49.4%), homogenization (33.6%), concentration (31.5%), volume (19.9%) and administration route (5.3%). To address these reporting limitations, we developed theGuidelines for Reporting Animal Fecal Transplant (GRAFT) that guide reporting standards for preclinical FMT. The GRAFT recommendations will enable robust reporting of preclinical FMT design, and facilitate high-quality peer review, improving the rigor and translation of knowledge gained through preclinical FMT studies.","Secombe, Kate R; Al-Qadami, Ghanyah H; Subramaniam, Courtney B; Bowen, Joanne M; Scott, Jacqui; Van Sebille, Ysabella Z A; Snelson, Matthew; Cowan, Caitlin; Clarke, Gerard; Gheorghe, Cassandra E; Cryan, John F; Wardill, Hannah R",Gut microbes,https://doi.org/10.1080/19490976.2021.1979878; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34586011/,728
108542,,2020-12-22,"The purpose of the study is to analyze patterns demonstrated by the COVID-19 epidemic process in a megacity during the increase, stabilization and reduction in the incidence, and to evaluate the effectiveness of the epidemic prevention measures. MATERIALS AND METHODS The comprehensive study incorporating epidemiological, molecular genetic and statistical research methods was conducted to analyze the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Moscow during the COVID- 19 pandemic. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION It was found that the exponential growth in COVID-19 cases was prevented due to the most stringent control and restrictive measures deployed in Moscow to break the chains of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and due to people who were very disciplined in complying with the self-isolation rules. The analysis of the dynamics in detection of new COVID-19 cases showed that in a megacity, the impact of social distancing and self-isolation would become apparent only after 3.5 incubation periods, where the maximum length of the period is 14 days. It was discovered that the detection frequency of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in relatively healthy population and its dynamics are important monitoring parameters, especially during the increase and stabilization in the COVID-19 incidence, and are instrumental in predicting the development of the epidemic situation within a range of 1-2 incubation periods (14-28 days). In Moscow, the case fatality rate was 1.73% over the observation period (6/3/2020-23/6/2020).

108785,,2021-01-01,"Resistance represents a major challenge for antibody-based therapy for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)1-4. Here we engineered an immunoglobulin M (IgM) neutralizing antibody (IgM-14) to overcome the resistance encountered by IgG-based therapeutics. IgM-14 is >230-fold more potent than its parental IgG-14 in neutralizing the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). IgM-14 potently neutralizes the resistant virus raised by its corresponding IgG-14, the newly emerged United Kingdom B.1.1.7, Brazilian P.1, and South African B.1.351 variants of concern (VOCs), and 21 other receptor-binding domain (RBD) mutants, many of which are resistant to the IgGs that have been authorized for emergency use. Although engineering IgG into IgM enhances antibody potency in general, selection of an optimal epitope is critical for identifying the most effective IgM that can overcome resistance. One single intranasal (IN) dose of 0.044 and 0.4 mg/kg IgM-14 confers prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 in mice, respectively. IgM-14, but not IgG-14, also confers potent therapeutic protection against the P.1 and B.1.351 variants. IgM-14 exhibits desirable IN pharmacokinetics and safety in rodents. Our results demonstrate that IN administration of an engineered IgM can improve efficacy, reduce resistance, and simplify the prophylactic and therapeutic treatment of COVID-19.","Ku, Zhiqiang; Xie, Xuping; Hinton, Paul R; Liu, Xinli; Ye, Xiaohua; Muruato, Antonio E; Ng, Dean C; Biswas, Sujit; Zou, Jing; Liu, Yang; Pandya, Deepal; Menachery, Vineet D; Rahman, Sachi; Cao, Yu-An; Deng, Hui; Xiong, Wei; Carlin, Kevin B; Liu, Junquan; Su, Hang; Haanes, Elizabeth J; Keyt, Bruce A; Zhang, Ningyan; Carroll, Stephen F; Shi, Pei-Yong; An, Zhiqiang",Nature,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03673-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34082438/,728

Additionally, many ACP initiatives fail to integrate directly into the electronic health record (EHR), resulting in infrequent and disorganized documentation. Objective To determine whether a nurse navigator-led ACP pathway combined with a health care professional-facing EHR interface improves the occurrence of ACP discussions and their documentation within the EHR. Design, Setting, and Participants This was a randomized effectiveness trial using the Zelen design, in which patients are randomized prior to informed consent, with only those randomized to the intervention subsequently approached to provide informed consent. Randomization began November 1, 2018, and follow-up concluded November 1, 2019. The study population included patients 65 years or older with multimorbidity combined with either cognitive or physical impairments, and/or frailty, assessed from 8 primary care practices in North Carolina. Interventions Participants were randomized to either a nurse navigator-led ACP pathway (n = 379) or usual care (n = 380). Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was documentation of a new ACP discussion within the EHR. Secondary outcomes included the usage of ACP billing codes, designation of a surrogate decision maker, and ACP legal form documentation. Exploratory outcomes included incident health care use. Results Among 759 randomized patients (mean age 77.7 years, 455 women [59.9%]), the nurse navigator-led ACP pathway resulted in a higher rate of ACP documentation (42.2% vs 3.7%, P < .001) as compared with usual care. The ACP billing codes were used more frequently for patients randomized to the nurse navigator-led ACP pathway (25.3% vs 1.3%, P < .001). Patients randomized to the nurse navigator-led ACP pathway more frequently designated a surrogate decision maker (64% vs 35%, P < .001) and completed ACP legal forms (24.3% vs 10.0%, P < .001). During follow-up, the incidence of emergency department visits and inpatient hospitalizations was similar between the randomized groups (hazard ratio, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.92-1.50). Conclusions and Relevance A nurse navigator-led ACP pathway integrated with a health care professional-facing EHR interface increased the frequency of ACP discussions and their documentation.

MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 60 participants, average age 13.1 years, were enrolled. At baseline, second molars were randomized into test and control, and assessed by ICDAS, SOPROLIFE, and DIAGNOdent. An independent investigator irradiated test molars with a CO2 laser (wavelength 9.3 μm, pulse duration 4 μs, pulse repetition rate 43 Hz, beam diameter 250 μm, average fluence 3.9 J/cm2, 20 laser pulses per spot). Test molars received laser and fluoride treatment, control teeth fluoride alone. Fluoride varnish was applied at baseline and at 6 months. After 6 and 12 months, teeth were again assessed. RESULTS A total of 57 participants completed the 6-month and 51 the 12-month recall. Laser-treated surfaces showed very slight ICDAS improvements over time with ICDAS change - 1 in 11% and 8%, no changes (ICDAS change 0) in 68% and 67%, and slightly worsened (ICDAS change 1) in 19% and 24% at 6- and 12-month recalls, respectively, and worsened by two scores in 2% at both recall time points. Control teeth showed significantly higher ICDAS increases, with 47% and 25% showing ICDAS change 0, ICDAS change 1 in 49% and 55%, and ICDAS change 2 in 4% and 20% at 6- and 12-month recalls, respectively. Differences in ICDAS changes between the groups were statistically significant (P = 0.0002 and P < 0.0001; Wilcoxon's signed-rank test, exact). A total of 22% of the participants developed ICDAS 3 scores on the control teeth.

109672,,2021-01-01,"BACKGROUND The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) rapidly shifted psychosocial services to telepsychology, including psychosocial oncology (PSO) practices. PSO providers work with patients undergoing treatment, experiencing treatment delays and/or immuno-suppression in the context of a global pandemic. There is evidence to support the acceptability of telepsychology among cancer patients and an emerging need for data to inform the design and provision of telepsychology PSO care during the pandemic and beyond. RESEARCH OBJECTIVES This study examined engagement in telepsychology PSO care at an outpatient community cancer center. METHODS The current study analyzed practice data from a PSO department from March 2020 through September 2020. The sample included 354 patients (91 established; 263 newly referred). Descriptive, correlational, and comparative analyses were conducted. RESULTS Among established patients, 93% continued with telepsychology PSO care after the pandemic and 94% completed at least one telepsychology appointment. Among newly referred patients, 50.6% scheduled a telepsychology appointment, consistent with the scheduling rate for the proceeding calendar year (50%). Across patients scheduling telepsychology PSO appointments (N = 194), 68 initially engaged in phone-based services with 20 converting to video, for a total of 127 (76.5%) patients utilizing video-based PSO services. Common reasons for phone-based services included 'patient preference' (N = 14), 'lack of access' (N = 9), and 'technology barriers' (N = 8). During this timeframe, 18% had at least one no-show, which is significantly less than the preceding year (23%). Phone-based patients were significantly older (p =.007). A greater proportion of males engaged in phone-based services compared to females (p = .006). CONCLUSIONS Telepsychology PSO engages new and existing patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. There may be an increased demand for services and increased utilization in the context of the pandemic and the availability of telepsychology. There are disparities and access issues that should be considered and addressed.","Myers Virtue, Shannon; Howrey, Hillary L; Duffy, Nicole M; Wallace, Meaghan",Journal of psychosocial oncology,https://doi.org/10.1080/07347332.2021.1894526; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33792503/,728

METHODS Any single or bilateral LT patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 between March 1, 2020, to February 15, 2021 (n=54) and survived the acute illness were included (final n=44). Each patient completed at least three months of follow-up (median: 4.5; range 3-12 months) after their index hospitalization for COVID-19. The primary endpoint was a significant loss of lung functions (defined as >10% decline in FVC or FEV1 on two spirometries, at least three weeks apart compared to the pre-infection baseline). RESULTS A majority of the COVID-19 survivors had persistent parenchymal opacities (n=29, 65.9%) on post-infection CT chest. Patients had significantly impaired functional status, with the majority reporting residual disabilities (Karnofsky performance scale score of 70% or worse; n=32, 72.7%). A significant loss of lung function was observed among 18 patients (40.9%). Three patients met the criteria for new chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) following COVID-19 (5.6%), with all three demonstrating restrictive allograft syndrome phenotype. An absolute lymphocyte count <0.6 X103 /dL and ferritin >150 ng/mL at the time of hospital discharge were independently associated with significant lung function loss. CONCLUSIONS A significant proportion of COVID-19 survivors suffer persistent allograft injury. A persistently low ALC and elevated ferritin at the conclusion of the hospital course may provide useful prognostic information and form the basis of a customized strategy for ongoing monitoring and management of allograft dysfunction.

One systematic review and three rapid reviews were identified and screened for relevant studies. Evidence on the effectiveness of thermal screening contained within this review was limited to points of entry (i.e., airports); thus the applicability to other community settings is uncertain. Thermal screening, implemented as part of a composite of screening measures (self-report of relevant symptoms, contact/travel history), was ineffective in identifying infectious individuals and limiting the spread of disease.

Repeated measures analysis of variance was used to compare continuous variables. Twenty-five patients were observed during the study period providing a total of 105 patient days. The average age was 44 years with 42% TBSA mean burn size. The average volume prescribed by providers was 1,598 ml/d. According to documentation, the average volume given was 1,448 ml/d, a significant difference (P = <.001). The average volume delivered as recorded on the feeding pump was less at 1,287 ml/d.

Here, we review viral proteins serving as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and their corresponding Toll-like receptors (TLRs). These viruses are all enveloped, including respiratory syncytial virus, hepatitis C virus, measles virus, herpesvirus human immunodeficiency virus and coronavirus, which can encode proteins to activate innate immunity in a TLR-dependent way.

This will be the catalyst for preventive interventions designed to treat adverse health problems among elderlies. DESIGN A 24-month follow-up longitudinal study on a community-based cohort. SETTING Community-setting. PARTICIPANTS Participants included a total of 9,936 older adults aged 65 years or older. MEASUREMENTS Frailty was characterized as slow walking speed or/and muscle weakness represented by grip strength. Cognitive function was assessed according to several tests. Cognitive impairment was defined below the age-education reference threshold. Participants were categorized into the four groups: robust, cognitive impairment alone, frailty alone, and cognitive frailty (both frail and cognitive impairment). Incident disability data was extracted from the Japanese Long-Term Care system. RESULTS The prevalence of cognitive frailty was 11.2%. The cumulative incidence rates of incident disability in each group were also estimated (robust, 9.6/1,000 person-years (95% CI 7.9 to 11.7); cognitive impairment, 21.3/1,000 person years (95% CI 16.3 to 27.7); frailty, 45.4/1,000 person years (95% CI 39.5 to 52.3); and cognitive frailty, 79.9/1,000 person years (95% CI 68.6 to 93.1)). Adjusted Cox proportional hazard model revealed that the cognitive frailty group had the highest hazard ratio (HR 3.86, 95%CI 2.95 - 5.05, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS A proper operational definition was developed to determine cognitive frailty among elderlies. Cognitive frailty is more associated with incident disability in community-setting than cognitive impairment or physical frailty alone.","Tsutsumimoto, K; Doi, T; Nakakubo, S; Kim, M; Kurita, S; Ishii, H; Shimada, H","The journal of nutrition, health & aging",https://doi.org/10.1007/s12603-020-1365-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32346687/,728
114730,,2020-05-26,"Otolaryngologists are at increased risk for exposure to suspected aerosol-generating procedures during the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. In the present study, we sought to quantify differences in aerosol generation during common ventilation scenarios. We performed a series of 30-second ventilation experiments on porcine larynx-trachea-lung specimens. We used an optical particle sizer to quantify the number of 1- to 10-µm particles observed per 30-second period (PP30). No significant aerosols were observed with ventilation of intubated specimens (10.8 ± 2.4 PP30 vs background 9.5 ± 2.1, P = 1.0000). Simulated coughing through a tracheostomy produced 53.5 ± 25.2 PP30, significantly more than background (P = .0121) and ventilation of an intubated specimen (P = .0401). These data suggest that undisturbed ventilation and thus intubation without stimulation or coughing may be safer than believed. Coughing increases aerosol production, particularly via tracheostomy. Otolaryngologists who frequently manage patient airways and perform tracheostomy are at increased risk for aerosol exposure and require appropriate personal protective equipment, especially during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","Xiao, Roy; Workman, Alan D; Puka, Elefteria; Juang, Jeremy; Naunheim, Matthew R; Song, Phillip C",Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1177/0194599820933595; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32539661/,728

118974,,2020-09-15,"INTRODUCTION Sepsis is a dysregulated host response to infection characterised by activation of proinflammatory and procoagulant mechanisms. Protein C (PC)'s activity as an anticoagulant and antiinflammatory molecule makes it an appealing target for sepsis biomarker studies. To date, there has been no systematic review of PC as a sepsis biomarker. OBJECTIVES To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy and prognostic strength of PC as a biomarker for adult sepsis. METHODS AND ANALYSIS Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, PubMed and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) will be searched from inception through 20 January 2021 for prospective observational studies that evaluate the use of PC as a diagnostic or prognostic biomarker for adult sepsis. Title and abstract screening, full-text screening and data extraction will be conducted in duplicate. Risk of bias will be assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies and Quality in Prognostic Studies tools. If sufficient data are available, a meta-analysis will be conducted. The standardised mean difference and 95% CI will be calculated for prognostic and diagnostic studies. If possible, a hierarchical summary receiver operator characteristic curve will be generated to assess overall prognostic and diagnostic biomarker accuracy. I2 statistics will be used to assess heterogeneity. Sensitivity analysis will be performed by removing studies with a high risk of bias and re-examining the meta-analysis results. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Given this is a systematic review and meta-analysis, there is no requirement for ethics approval.

119102,,2020,"CRISPR-diagnostic assays have gained significant interest in the last few years. This interest has grown rapidly during the current COVID-19 pandemic, where CRISPR-diagnostics have been frontline contenders for rapid testing solutions. This surge in CRISPR-diagnostic research prompts the following question: what exactly are the achievable limits of detection and associated assay times enabled by the kinetics of enzymes such as Cas12 and Cas13? To explore this question, we here present a model based on Michaelis-Menten enzyme kinetics theory applied to CRISPR enzymes. We use the model to develop analytical solutions for reaction kinetics and develop back-of-the-envelope criteria to validate and check for consistency in reported enzyme kinetic parameters. We applied our analyses to all studies known to us, which report Michaelis-Menten-type kinetic data for CRISPR-associated enzymes. These studies include all subtypes of Cas12 and Cas13 and orthologs. We found all but one study clearly violate at least two of our three rules and therefore present data that violate basic physical limits. We performed an experimental study of reaction kinetics of LbCas12a with both ssDNA and dsDNA activators and use these data to validate our model and its predicted scaling. The validated model is used to explore CRISPR reaction time scales and the degree of reaction completion for practically relevant target concentrations applicable to CRISPR-diagnostic assays. The results have broad implications for achievable limits of detection and assay times of emerging, amplification-free CRISPR-detection methods.","Ramachandran, Ashwin; Santiago, Juan G",Analytical chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.1c00525; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33979119/,728

119342,,2020-10-27,"PURPOSE To determine whether 24% sucrose solution given orally before insertion of a peripheral intravenous (PIV) catheter decreases neonatal pain. BACKGROUND Prior studies of pain caused by heel and arterial needlesticks found oral administration of 24% sucrose to significantly blunt pain during these painful procedures. No studies have evaluated this treatment with needlestick pain associated with PIV catheter insertion. METHODS Oral 24% sucrose or placebo solution was administered 2 minutes prior to PIV catheter insertion. Outcome measures were obtained prior to, during, and for 5 minutes after PIV catheter insertion. Investigators and caregivers were blinded to group assignment. Data were analyzed with longitudinal analysis of repeated measures, with P < .05 for significance. RESULTS A total of 40 neonates (24% sucrose: N = 20; placebo: N = 20) were studied. Pain scores significantly increased from 3.2 ± 1.6 to a maximum of 7.6 ± 3.8 at the time of catheter insertion, returning to baseline levels 8 minutes after PIV catheter insertion (P < .001). No significant differences were found in pain, heart rate, or noninvasive oxygen saturation (SpO2) between the sucrose and placebo groups (P > 0.05). IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE Results from this study did not find that 24% sucrose administered prior to PIV catheter insertion altered the infant's pain response. IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH Since this is the first study to evaluate the pain-blunting effects of 24% sucrose administration before PIV catheter insertion, replication of this study is needed before widespread application of findings.","Cook, Linda M; Nichols-Dada, Jacinth; Damani, Samina; Lawrence, Vickie; Layson, Sandra; Mitchell, Diane; Muhammad, Shaqunna; Samaniego-Yamin, Lourdes; Talley, Jacquelyn Walters; VanNatta, Barbara; Higgins, Melinda; Cooley, Kim",Advances in neonatal care : official journal of the National Association of Neonatal Nurses,https://doi.org/10.1097/anc.0000000000000326; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27533333/,728

Early identification of high-risk infants enables appropriate clinical care to mitigate potential lifelong disabilities. Near infra-red spectroscopy is an established technology that can provide continuous measurements of cerebral oxygen saturation (rcSO2) over this critical period. We develop a feature set of the rcSO2 signal for the purpose of detecting brain injury. Our feature set contains amplitude, spectral, and fractal dimension features within 5 frequency bands. Features are combined in a support vector machine (SVM) and performance is assessed within a cross-validation procedure. Using a cohort of 47 infants of <;32 weeks of gestation, we find significant (p <; 0.05) features of amplitude in the frequency band 0.9-3.6 mHz and a fractal dimension measure in the frequency band 1.8-3.6 mHz. The SVM has an area-under the receiver operator characteristic (AUC) of 0.75 with sensitivity-specificity values of 67-77%. These moderate results highlight the potential for quantitative analysis of rcSO2 to detect brain injury and thus enable early identification of high-risk infants.","O'Toole, John M; Kenosi, Mmoloki; Finn, Daragh; Boylan, Geraldine B; Dempsey, Eugene M; Otoole, John M",Conference proceedings : ...

121220,,2020-09-15,"Since radio frequency (RF) signals from public mobile systems are stochastic and exhibit large temporal variations, the results of measurements, typically E field measurements, are time dependent and highly variable. Therefore, any 6-min measurements and 6-min averaged results to obtain the mean level strength at a given place may not be so reliable when it comes to determine long-term exposure levels. Specifically, the results of such short-term exposure assessments can be both under- or overestimated depending on whether the extreme value is caught during the measurement time. Because the RF range is active 24 h a day, the authors suggest that the monitoring process should cover the same time period. To evaluate the variability of measurement results, the analysis in this paper was conducted through descriptive statistics of the 24-h instantaneous, time-averaged and integral-based values. By applying the 24-h time-averaged and integral-based measure on a 24-h data set of measurements, the variability of daily exposure could be reduced to ±20% of the mean week value obtained either with the time-averaged or integral-based measure.","Šuka, Darko; Pejović, Predrag; Simić-Pejović, Mirjana",Radiation protection dosimetry,https://doi.org/10.1093/rpd/ncaa091; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32696961/,728

METHODS A total of 114 instructors and non-instructors from the Neonatal Resuscitation Program of the Brazilian Society of Pediatrics participated in this study. Participants ventilated an intubated manikin. To evaluate respiratory mechanics and sustained lung inflation parameters, a direct comparison was made between the self-inflating bag and the T-shaped resuscitator (T-piece), followed by an analysis of the effectiveness of the equipment according to the participants' education and training. RESULTS A difference between equipment types was observed for the tidal volume, with a median (interquartile range) of 28.5 mL (12.6) for the self-inflating bag and 20.1 mL (8.4) for the T-piece in the instructor group and 31.6 mL (14) for the self-inflating bag and 22.3 mL (8.8) for the T-piece in the non-instructor group. Higher inspiratory time values were observed with the T-piece in both groups of professionals, with no significant difference between them. The operator's ability to maintain the target pressure over the 10 seconds of sustained lung inflation was evaluated using the area under the pressure-time curve and was 1.7-fold higher with the use of the T-piece. Inspiratory pressure and mean airway pressure applied during sustained lung inflation were greater with the self-inflating bag, as evaluated between the beginning and the end of the procedure. CONCLUSION The T-piece resulted in lower tidal volume and higher inspiratory time values, irrespective of the operator's experience, and increased the ease of performing the sustained lung inflation maneuver, as demonstrated by the maintenance of target pressure for the desired period and a higher mean airway pressure than that obtained using the self-inflating bag.","do Prado, Cristiane; Guinsburg, Ruth; de Almeida, Maria Fernanda Branco; Mascaretti, Renata Suman; Vale, Luciana Assis; Haddad, Luciana Branco; Rebello, Celso Moura",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0148475; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26859896/,728

METHODS 88 patients received PVE either by particles / coils (n = 77) or by glue / oil (n = 11), supported by 7 right hepatic vein embolizations (HVE) by coils or occluders. All complications were categorized by the Clavien- Dindo (CD) and the CIRSE classification. RESULTS In 88 patients (median age 68 years) there was one intervention with a biliary leak and subsequent drainage (complication grade 3 CD, CIRSE 3), two with prolonged hospital stay (grade 2 CD, grade 3 CIRSE) and 13 complications grade 1 CD, but no complications of grade 4 or higher neither in Clavien- Dindo nor in CIRSE classification.

123571,,2020-03-17,"Introduction The efficacy of the endovascular treatment of acute ischemic stroke has been substantiated by several recent randomized clinical trials. While intra-arterial therapy has significantly evolved in recent years, anatomic cerebrovascular variants and disease burden can present challenges to timely recanalization. We present the first reported case of anterior-to-posterior mechanical clot retrieval with use of a stent retriever. Case description A 53-year-old man presented with basilar artery thrombosis. Endovascular mechanical clot retrieval was performed. The typical, antegrade, access to the basilar artery thrombus was precluded by the findings of a hypoplastic left vertebral artery and an occluded proximal right vertebral artery. Given a number of factors including the patient's worsening symptoms and the high morbidity and mortality associated with basilar stroke, cross-circulation-anterior-to-posterior-intra-arterial therapy was performed. Thrombectomy of the basilar thrombus was achieved via the right internal carotid artery and right posterior communicating artery. Conclusion To our knowledge, we report the first case of cross-circulation, anterior-to-posterior thrombectomy, with the use of a stent-retriever device. Cross-circulation stroke treatment may be beneficial in cases of proximal vessel occlusion or anatomical constraints. Larger studies will need to evaluate the safety and efficacy of these approaches.","Sultan-Qurraie, Ali; Rozansky, Gregory; Cox, John Andrew; Lazzaro, Marc","Interventional neuroradiology : journal of peritherapeutic neuroradiology, surgical procedures and related neurosciences",https://doi.org/10.1177/1591019917706191; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28480772/,728
123638,,2020,"Although anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using a bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB) autograft has many advantages (e.g., high strength and solid fixation), there are also several complications (e.g., anterior knee pain or kneeling pain) due to harvest-site morbidity associated with the use of this graft type compared with the use of hamstring tendon. Therefore the ultimate goal of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using a BPTB graft is to minimize harvest-site morbidity. We have used a technique for harvesting central-third BPTB grafts that involves only a 3-cm-long, longitudinal, curved incision in the medial tibial tuberosity for both graft harvesting and fixation. The purpose of this report is to describe the technique, which can avoid the harvest-site morbidities associated with BPTB autografts during knee arthroscopy. We believe that this less invasive reconstruction may reduce the harvest-site morbidities associated with BPTB grafts because it allows for BPTB graft harvesting without incising the synovial bursa or paratenon and mitigates scarring and adhesion formation.","Koh, Eitaku; Oe, Kenichi; Takemura, Seisuke; Iida, Hirokazu",Arthroscopy techniques,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eats.2015.01.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26052497/,728

124643,,2020,"BACKGROUND Although radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is widely accepted as a percutaneous treatment for liver tumors; serious complications may occur resulting in 0.1% to 0.5% mortality. This study analyzed the risk factors and management of hemorrhagic complications, such as hemoperitoneum, hemothorax, and hemobilia. METHODS We performed 4133 RFA treatments in 2154 patients with primary and metastatic liver tumors from February 1999 to December 2007. Of these, we enrolled patients with hemorrhagic complications and reviewed their medical records thoroughly. The risk factors for each hemorrhagic complication were analyzed using unconditional logistic regression. RESULTS Hemorrhagic complications occurred in 63 out of 4133 treatments (1.5%), including hemoperitoneum in 29 (0.7%), hemothorax in 14 (0.3%), and hemobilia in 20 (0.5%). Eleven, 8, and 4 of these patients, respectively, were categorized as major complications requiring blood transfusion or drainage. Two patients died after hemoperitoneum. Logistic regression analysis revealed large tumor size [odds ratio (OR) 1.06 per 1 mm increase in diameter] and low platelet count (OR 0.88 per 10,000/microL increase) were significant risk factors for hemoperitoneum. The location of tumor nodules was a significant risk factor for hemothorax (segment 7, OR 2.31) and hemobilia (segment 1, OR 3.30). Other factors, including the number of needle insertions or the duration of ablation, were not significant.

METHODS We analyzed all primary hypospadias repair cases from December 2011 through December 2018 at Texas Children's Hospital with a minimum of 1-year follow-up for the presence of complications: urethra-cutaneous fistula and glanular dehiscence. Surgical (surgeon, operative time, block type, local anesthetic, meatal position) and patient (age at correction, prematurity) factors were additionally analyzed. RESULTS For the primary aim, 983 patients underwent primary hypospadias correction with a minimum of one year of postoperative follow-up data. There were 897 patients (91.3%) in which no complications were identified and 86 (8.7%) with either urocutaneous fistula (n=81) or glanular dehiscence (n=5). Of the 86 identified complications, (45/812 (5.5%) were distal, 41/171 (24%) were proximal; p=<0.001) with a complication, Rate of complications was not associated with caudal block (OR: 0.67, 95% CI: 0.41-1.09; p=0.11). On univariable analysis, age (OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.04-1.20; p=0.04), surgical duration (OR 1.02; 95% CI 1.01-1.02; p=<0.001), prematurity <32 weeks (OR 4.38, 95% CI 1.54-4.11 p=<0.001) and position of meatus as proximal (OR 5.38 95% CI 3.39-8.53; p=<0.001) were associated with an increased rate of complications. However, on multivariable analysis, associations of age (OR: 1.13, 95% CI: 1.05-1.22; p=0.001), surgery duration (OR: 1.01, 95% CI: 1.01-1.02; p=<0.001) and meatal position (OR: 3.85, 95% CI: 2.32-6.39; p=<0.001) were associated with increased rate of complications. CONCLUSION Our data suggests that meatal location, older age, extreme prematurity and surgical duration are associated with increased incidence of complications (urethra-cutaneous fistula and glanular dehiscence) following hypospadias correction. Analgesic block was not associated with increased hypospadias complication risk.","Adler, Adam C; Chandrakantan, Arvind; Lee, Andrew D; Koh, Chester J; Janzen, Nicolette K; Austin, Paul F",The Journal of urology,https://doi.org/10.1097/ju.0000000000001448; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33347774/,728
124785,,2020,"A new cnidarian myxosporean infecting the spleen of an economic and ecological important bryconid fish (Salminus franciscanus) is described based on integrative taxonomic approach including morphological, ultrastructural, biological traits, geography, molecular data and phylogenetic analysis. In a total of thirty specimens examined, nineteen (63.3%) were infected by an undescribed parasite species belonging to the genus Myxobolus. Plasmodial development was asynchronous, with young development in the periphery and mature myxospores in the central area and without projections and microvilli in the plasmodial wall. Mature myxospores were ovoid in shape and measured 7.9 ± 0.2 μm (7.6-8.1 μm) in length and 5.4 ± 0.1 μm (5.0-5.6 μm) in width. The two polar capsules were equal in size, occupying a little more than half of the myxospore body, measuring 4.0 ± 0.2 μm (3.9-4.1 μm) in length and 1.7 ± 0.1 μm (1.5-1.8 μm) in width. The polar tubules coiled in six turns, perpendicular to the long axis of polar capsule. Phylogenetic analysis placed the new species within a clade containing nine myxobolid species from South American characiforms fish and appears as a close species of Myxobolus pantanalis. Nevertheless, the sequences of the new species and M. pantanalis have a large genetic divergence of 13.5% in their SSU rDNA. In light of the differences observed from the integrative taxonomy, we confidently considered that this isolate is a new species of cnidarian myxosporean, M. douradae n. sp., increasing the knowledge of diversity of this enigmatic group of cnidarians.","Milanin, Tiago; Mathews, Patrick D; Morandini, André C; Mertins, Omar; Audebert, Fabienne; Pereira, Jose O L; Maia, Antonio A M",Microbial pathogenesis,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2020.104718; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33385492/,728
125010,,2020-10-01,"BACKGROUND The current US context is marked by extreme right-left partisanship, which means that state policies tend to bundle together and are not experienced in isolation. While prior work has leveraged abrupt shifts in single policies to examine the effects of state policy on birth outcomes, we examined a holistic measure that captures political polarisation. METHODS Data were drawn from national birth certificates for 2003-2017 (N=56 770 470). Outcomes included preterm birth, low birth weight, small-for-gestational age and other perinatal health measures. The primary exposure was a composite index of right-left state policy orientation, generated from historical data on 135 state policies. Multivariable regressions were used to estimate the association between state policy orientation and each outcome, adjusting for relevant covariates. RESULTS Compared with infants born in states with right-leaning policy orientations, those born in left-leaning states had lower odds of adverse birth outcomes (eg, low birth weight: OR 0.95 (0.93, 0.97), preterm birth: OR 0.94 (0.92, 0.95)). Subgroup analyses revealed stronger associations for US-born and White mothers. With the inclusion of state fixed effects, left-leaning policy orientation was no longer associated with lower odds of adverse birth outcomes. Models were otherwise robust to alternative specifications. CONCLUSION While left-leaning state policy orientation has protective associations with a range of birth outcomes, the associations may be explained by stable characteristics of states, at least during the study period. Future studies should examine state policy orientation in association with other health outcomes and study periods.","Riley, Alicia R; Collin, Daniel; Grumbach, Jacob M; Torres, Jacqueline M; Hamad, Rita",Journal of epidemiology and community health,https://doi.org/10.1136/jech-2020-214858; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33408163/,728
125928,,2020-09-29,"Introduction The authors examined the time that medical librarians spent on specific tasks for systematic reviews (SRs): interview process, search strategy development, search strategy translation, documentation, deliverables, search methodology writing, and instruction. We also investigated relationships among the time spent on SR tasks, years of experience, and number of completed SRs to gain a better understanding of the time spent on SR tasks from time, staffing, and project management perspectives. Methods A confidential survey and study description were sent to medical library directors who were members of the Association of Academic Health Sciences Libraries as well as librarians serving members of the Association of American Medical Colleges or American Osteopathic Association. Results Of the 185 participants, 143 (77%) had worked on an SR within the last 5 years. The number of SRs conducted by participants during their careers ranged from 1 to 500, with a median of 5. The major component of time spent was on search strategy development and translation. Average aggregated time for standard tasks was 26.9 hours, with a median of 18.5 hours. Task time was unrelated to the number of SRs but was positively correlated with years of SR experience. Conclusion The time required to conduct the librarian's discrete tasks in an SR varies substantially, and there are no standard time frames. Librarians with more SR experience spent more time on instruction and interviews; time spent on all other tasks varied widely. Librarians also can expect to spend a significant amount of their time on search strategy development, translation, and writing.","Bullers, Krystal; Howard, Allison M; Hanson, Ardis; Kearns, William D; Orriola, John J; Polo, Randall L; Sakmar, Kristen A",Journal of the Medical Library Association : JMLA,https://doi.org/10.5195/jmla.2018.323; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29632442/,728
125959,,2021-03-17,"OBJECTIVE This article reports on patients with early stage prostate cancer treated with single plus one port robotic radical prostatectomy (SPORP). MATERIALS AND METHODS Since January 2014, we performed SPORP in 8 patients with localized prostate cancer. Age of patients, clinical stage, operation time, intraoperative and postoperative complications, blood loss, histopathological evaluation, postoperative continence, serum level of PSA were evaluated. RESULTS Mean age of the 8 patients was 59.85 years. All operations were completed without conversion to standard robotic procedure or open surgery. No intra operative complications occurred. Mean operating time was 143 minutes; prostate excision 123 minutes and urethrovesical anastomosis 20 minutes. Mean blood loss was 45 ml. Preoperative Gleason scores were (3 + 4) in one patient and (3 + 3) in 7 patients. Postoperative Gleason scores were (3 + 4) in 2 patients, and (3 + 3) in 6 patients. All these 8 cases were in T1c clinical stage. Early postoperative complications were drain leakage (n = 1), atelectasis (n = 1), wound infection (n = 1) and fever (n = 1). There was no positive surgical margin. The serum level of PSA was less than 0.2 ng/ml and no other complications happened during the 4 to 12 months follow-up period. Postoperative continence and cosmetic results were excellent. CONCLUSIONS It is relatively easy for urologists who are skilled in traditional laparoscopic and robotic surgeries to master SPORP. However long-term outcomes of this surgery need further investigations.","Tugcu, Volkan; Simsek, Abdulmuttalip; Evren, Ismail; Seker, Kamil Gokhan; Kocakaya, Ramazan; Torer, Bugra Dogukan; Atar, Arda; Tasci, Ali Ihsan","Archivio italiano di urologia, andrologia : organo ufficiale [di] Societa italiana di ecografia urologica e nefrologica",https://doi.org/10.4081/aiua.2017.3.178; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28969400/,728

The announced, but unpredicted, radical and global experience of the Covid-19 pandemia has revealed the degree of ignorance, fragmentation, inadequacy of the national and international knowledge and strategies of intervention and, even more substantially, of coordination across all the critical areas of prevention and care. The importance of the nursing component of the organisation and of the technical and cultural aspects of health care delivery and accessibility has been underlined as a protagonist of the resistance and resilience during the worst period of the emergency, and should be specifically involved in this renewal, where a profound modification of the interactions, hierarchies, roles of various professions is required.

126340,,2020-03-18,"Aquifer storage and recovery (ASR) technology has been adopted as a strategic water management tool. However, during the injection of oxic and organic carbon-containing water to the underground aquifers, severe phenomena such as clogging and groundwater deterioration have been reported. To prevent these severe phenomena, assimilable organic carbon (AOC) concentration was controlled in the ASR applications by supporting bacteria growth potential. In this study, the AOC removal strategy was investigated in a simulated ASR system using an indigenous bacterium, Pseudomonas jinjuensis. AOC removal was evaluated under three different experimental conditions: (i) 30 oC and aerobic, (ii) 15 oC and aerobic, and (iii) 15 oC and anoxic. The effects of contact media such as sand and granular activated carbon on AOC removal efficiency were also investigated. Results show that under the 30 oC aerobic condition, P. jinjuensis could remove 99.8% (13 μg L-1) of AOC with soil. The variations in the organic fractions determined by liquid chromatography with organic carbon detector analysis were observed and showed trends similar to those of AOC determined by the flow cytometry method. The indirect injection method in ASR application was recommended due to the AOC removal benefit by soil indigenous bacterium.","Nguyen, Hien Thi; Kim, Youngjae; Choi, Jae-Woo; Cho, Kyungjin; Jeong, Seongpil",Environmental research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2020.110033; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32810494/,728

126853,,2020-06-01,"PURPOSE Wide variation in care and costs exists regarding the management of abdominal wall hernias, with unproven benefit for many therapies. This work establishes a specialty society-based solution to improve the quality and value of care delivered to hernia patients during routine clinical management on a national scale. METHODS The Americas Hernia Society Quality Task Force was charged by the Americas Hernia Society leadership to develop an initiative that utilizes the concepts of continuous quality improvement (CQI). A disease-based registry was created to collect information for CQI incorporating real-time outcome reporting, patient reported outcomes, stakeholder engagement, and collaborative learning methods to form a comprehensive quality improvement effort. RESULTS The Americas Hernia Society Quality Collaborative (AHSQC) was formed with the mission to provide health care professionals real-time information for maximizing value in hernia care. The initial disease areas selected for CQI were incisional and parastomal hernias with ten priorities encompassing the spectrum of care. A prospective registry was created with real-time analytic feedback to surgeons. A data assurance process was implemented to ensure maximal data quality and completeness. Four collaborative meetings per year were established to meet the goals of the AHSQC. As of the fourth quarter 2014, the AHSQC includes nearly 2377 patients at 38 institutions with 82 participating surgeons. CONCLUSIONS The AHSQC has been established as a quality improvement initiative utilizing concepts of CQI. This ongoing effort will continually refine its scope and goals based on stakeholder input to improve care delivered to hernia patients.","Poulose, B K; Roll, S; Murphy, J W; Matthews, B D; Todd Heniford, B; Voeller, G; Hope, W W; Goldblatt, M I; Adrales, G L; Rosen, M J",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10029-016-1477-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26936373/,728

Promoting green space might be a valuable strategy to help improve population health in China, as well as a range of co-benefits (e.g., increasing resilience to climate change). No systematic review has so far determined the degree of association between green space and health outcomes in China. This review was conducted to address this gap. Five electronic databases were searched using search terms on green space, health, and China. The review of 83 publications that met eligibility criteria reports associations indicative of various health benefits from more green space, including mental health, general health, healthier weight status and anthropometry, and more favorable cardiometabolic and cerebrovascular outcomes. There was insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions on mortality, birth outcomes, and cognitive function, and findings on respiratory and infectious outcomes were inconsistent and limited.

127793,,2020-01-01,"PURPOSE To evaluate the feasibility of combining transcatheter computed tomography (CT) arterial portography or transcatheter CT hepatic arteriography with percutaneous liver ablation for optimized and repeated tumor exposure. MATERIALS AND METHODS Study participants were 20 patients (13 men and 7 women; mean age, 59.4 y; range, 40-76 y) with unresectable liver-only malignancies--14 with colorectal liver metastases (29 lesions), 5 with hepatocellular carcinoma (7 lesions), and 1 with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (2 lesions)--that were obscure on nonenhanced CT. A catheter was placed within the superior mesenteric artery (CT arterial portography) or in the hepatic artery (CT hepatic arteriography). CT arterial portography or CT hepatic arteriography was repeatedly performed after injecting 30-60 mL 1:2 diluted contrast material to plan, guide, and evaluate ablation. The operator confidence levels and the liver-to-lesion attenuation differences were assessed as well as needle-to-target mismatch distance, technical success, and technique effectiveness after 3 months. RESULTS Technical success rate was 100%; there were no major complications. Compared with conventional unenhanced CT, operator confidence increased significantly for CT arterial portography or CT hepatic arteriography cases (P < .001). The liver-to-lesion attenuation differences between unenhanced CT, contrast-enhanced CT, and CT arterial portography or CT hepatic arteriography were statistically significant (mean attenuation difference, 5 HU vs 28 HU vs 70 HU; P < .001). Mean needle-to-target mismatch distance was 2.4 mm ± 1.2 (range, 0-12.0 mm). Primary technique effectiveness at 3 months was 87% (33 of 38 lesions).

127826,,2021-04-01,"BACKGROUND Ureteral stent insertion and subsequent removal remains one of the most common procedures performed in endourology. We aimed to evaluate a novel, one-step method, permitting simultaneous stent removal and guidewire passage using a self-constructed suture snare via standard cystoscopy. This method should be used prior to ureteroscopy, in cases of minimal stent encrustation and peri-ureteral mucosal oedema, where identification and subsequent cannulation of the ureteral orifice may be a challenge. METHODS A self-constructed suture snare is constructed using an open-ended ureteral catheter to facilitate this novel 'Switch' technique. Operative duration, cost feasibility and potential complications with this novel method were assessed in patients with an indwelling stent duration above 100 days. RESULTS Age inclusion in this study ranged from 21 to 35 years, with kidney, ureter and bladder scores below 6, in the five patients assessed. Previous ureteral stent indwelling time ranged from 106 to 315 days. Reasons for (pre-stented) ureteroscopy were mostly stone related. The overall recorded procedure time for the Switch technique was successfully performed in less than 96 s (range 68-95 s) in all cases within this series. No procedure-related complications were reported. CONCLUSION Utilizing the suture snare, the novel Switch technique was successfully performed in all cases assessed. This method is both time and cost feasible and could be easily utilized in resource-limited areas, regional centres or in cases where a stent grasper is not available, may have malfunctioned or cannot adequately approximate due to distal ureteral stent encrustation.","Adam, Ahmed; Bhattu, Amit S; Lawrentschuk, Nathan",ANZ journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1111/ans.16621; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33528100/,728
128345,,2021-01-05,"The use of maternal antiepileptic drug (AED) during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of cognitive adverse effects among the offspring. As new-generation AEDs continue to enter the market, evidence on their safety during pregnancy is limited yet necessary. To date, there are no published reviews summarizing the evidence of new-generation AED exposure in utero and the development of attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in the offspring. The objective of this scoping review is to summarize the available evidence on the risk of ADHD after maternal exposure to new-generation AEDs during pregnancy. We searched EMBASE and MEDLINE for articles published from January 1988 to April 2020. New-generation AEDs were considered if marketed after 1988. ADHD was defined as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, hyperkinetic disorder, hyperkinesis, or conduct disorder. Of the total articles screened (n = 805), eight publications were finally included (seven cohort studies and one systematic review). Across the studies, the sample size of pregnant women exposed to AEDs ranged from 1 to 1383. Monotherapy was examined in six studies (mostly lamotrigine), while only two studies examined polytherapy. The included studies reported a range of adjusted relative risks, from 0.84 [0.59-1.19] to 1.63 [0.41-6.06]. Lamotrigine monotherapy holds the largest body of evidence, concluding that no significant risk of ADHD exists among the offspring. However, the available evidence is considered scarce and has several methodological limitations. Disentangling the effect of AEDs from epilepsy itself and examining polytherapies are challenges that merit additional investigations. Further comparative safety studies with longer follow-up periods and large sample sizes are needed to accurately quantify the true impact of new-generation AED exposure during pregnancy and ADHD in children.","Vaccaro, Christine; Shakeri, Ahmad; Czaplinski, Emily; Eltonsy, Sherif",Journal of population therapeutics and clinical pharmacology = Journal de la therapeutique des populations et de la pharmacologie clinique,https://doi.org/10.15586/jptcp.v27i4.722; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33084259/,728

A previous report on the state of the preventive medicine workforce in 2000 revealed an ongoing decline in preventive medicine physicians and residents, but there have been few updates since. OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to describe trends in both the number of board-certified preventive medicine physicians and those physicians who self-designate preventive medicine as a primary or secondary specialty and examine the age, gender distribution, and geographic distribution of this workforce. DESIGN Analysis of the supply of preventive medicine physicians using data derived from board certification files of the American Board of Preventive Medicine and self-designation data from the American Medical Association Masterfile. SETTING The 50 US states and District of Columbia. PARTICIPANTS Board-certified and self-designated preventive medicine physicians in the United States. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Number, demographics, and location of preventive medicine physicians in United States. RESULTS From 1999 to 2018, the total number of physicians board certified in preventive medicine increased from 6091 to 9270; the number of self-identified preventive medicine physicians has generally decreased since 2000, with a leveling off in the past 4 years matching the trend of preventive medicine physicians per 100 000 population; there is a recent increase in women in the specialty; the practice locations of preventive medicine physicians do not match the US population in rural or micropolitan areas; and the average age of preventive medicine physicians is increasing. CONCLUSIONS The number of preventive medicine physicians is not likely to match population needs in the United States in the near term and beyond. Assessing the preventive medicine physician workforce in the United States is complicated by difficulties in defining the specialty and because less than half of self-designated preventive medicine physicians hold a board certification in the specialty.","Ricketts, Thomas C; Porterfield, Deborah S; Miller, Randall L; Fraher, Erin P",Journal of public health management and practice : JPHMP,https://doi.org/10.1097/phh.0000000000001322; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33785682/,728

A manually manipulated robot-like device is still at the experimental stage. Robot-assisted surgery has substantially revolutionized laparoscopy, increasing its distribution; however, robot-assisted surgery is associated with considerable costs. All technical improvements of laparoscopic surgery are extremely valuable to further simplify the use of classical laparoscopy.","Rassweiler, Jens J; Teber, Dogu",Nature reviews.

131878,,2020-05-01,"OBJECTIVES We aimed to determine the illness severity associated with respiratory picornaviruses (rhinovirus/enterovirus). METHODS Electronic medical records of pediatric emergency department (PED) visits were reviewed. The percent positive of respiratory pathogens, tested by using viral polymerase chain reaction panel, was determined for the July 2012 to June 2013 period. Logistic regression was used to determine the association of picornaviruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and influenza with ICU admission during the 2012-2013 academic year. Medical records of visits leading to ICU admission with picornaviruses were reviewed. RESULTS During 2012-2013, picornaviruses were more commonly identified (22.6%) among admitted patients than influenza (6.4%) or RSV (15.1%). Picornaviruses and RSV were associated with ICU admission (picornaviruses: adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.99 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.68-2.36]; RSV: aOR, 1.49 [95% CI: 1.20-1.85]) while influenza was not (aOR, 0.93 [95% CI: 0.66-1.29]). Of visits resulting in ICU admission, 79% were from patients with previous high-risk medical conditions, of which asthma or a history of wheezing was the most common (43%). CONCLUSIONS Picornaviruses can be associated with severe disease in children, especially those with underlying medical conditions. During times of high picornavirus activity, hospitals should target infection control measures to limit the spread of picornaviruses and protect the vulnerable patients. Future research into targeted therapies for picornaviruses and vaccines is needed.","Fleming-Dutra, Katherine E; Simon, Harold K; Fortenberry, James D; Jerris, Robert; Radecke, Jaime; Hirsh, Daniel A",Hospital pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.1542/hpeds.2014-0111; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26231633/,728

132520,,2021-02-26,"ABSTRACT Pain puts patients at risk for developing psychiatric conditions such as anxiety and depression. Pre-clinical mouse models of pain-induced affective behavior vary widely in methodology and results, impairing progress towards improved therapeutics. To systematically investigate the effect of long-term inflammatory pain on exploratory behavior and stress coping strategy, we assessed male C57BL/6J mice in the forced swim test (FST), elevated zero maze (EZM), and open field test (OFT) at four and six weeks post-injection of Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA), while controlling for testing order and combination. Inflammatory pain did not induce a passive stress coping strategy in the FST and did not reduce exploratory behavior in the EZM or the OFT. Using systematic correlational analysis and composite behavioral scores, we found no consistent association among measures for mice with or without inflammatory pain. A meta-analysis of similar studies indicated a modest, significant effect of CFA on exploratory behavior, but not immobility in the FST, and high heterogeneity among effect sizes in all three paradigms. Given the urgency for understanding the mechanisms of pain comorbidities and identifying novel therapies, these findings support the reallocation of our limited resources away from such unreliable assays and toward motivated and naturalistic behaviors. Future studies in pain and psychiatric translational research may benefit by considering outcomes beyond binary categorization, quantifying the associations between multiple measured behaviors, and agnostically identifying subtle yet meaningful patterns in behaviors.","Burek, Dominika J; Massaly, Nicolas; Doering, Michelle; Zec, Azra; Gaelen, Jordan; Morón, Jose A",Pain,https://doi.org/10.1097/j.pain.0000000000002179; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33433146/,728

132769,,2020-05-05,"BACKGROUND Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) are present in a majority of patients with dementia contributing to increased morbidity, health care costs, and caregiver burden. While there are no United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved medications for these symptoms, off-label use of medications such as antipsychotics have been shown to have significant adverse effects including increased mortality. The goal of this review is to examine the efficacy and safety of anticonvulsants in the treatment of BPSD. METHODS We will systematically search for randomized trials of anticonvulsants compared to placebo or other treatments such as antidepressants and antipsychotics from the following sources: The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (OVID SP) in Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations (latest version), EMBASE, clinicalTrials.gov , and the WHO Clinical Trials Registry. The studies will be limited to those published in English but the study location can be worldwide. We will include studies pertaining to individuals with dementia and symptoms of BPSD. The primary outcomes will be behavioral change as measured by validated scales and secondary outcomes will include caregiver burden, quality of life, placement in long term care facility, serious adverse effects, and treatment discontinuation due to adverse effects. Two sets of reviewers will independently screen select and extract data. We will narratively describe the major findings and conclusions from individual studies. Patients who are prescribed antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) for other indications, including seizures, will be excluded. Outcomes of interest will include a change in a validated scale that measures BPSD, serious adverse events, and caregiver quality of life outcomes. If the data are found to be appropriate for a meta-analysis, we will use a random effects model to compute summary estimates of treatment effects. DISCUSSION This is a protocol for a systematic review addressing the anticonvulsant group of medications as a whole, and as such, our results will inform current clinical practice in the use of anticonvulsants for BPSD. It will also help clinicians and policy makers compare the efficacy of anticonvulsants compared to antidepressants and antipsychotics as well as identify areas which will need further study.

133733,,2020-12-15,"Iron and steel industry emission is an important industrial source of air pollution. However, little is known about the relationship between volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted and regional air pollution. In this study, VOCs emissions from a typical iron and steel plant in Yangtze River Delta (YRD, China) were monitored from April 2018 to March 2019. The ozone formation potential (OFP) and secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation of VOCs were calculated to reveal the influence of VOCs emissions on regional ozone and particulate pollution, and the sensitivity analysis approach was performed to explore the qualitative and quantitative relationships between VOCs and O3, as well as VOCs and PM2.5. The VOCs concentration was 93.76 ± 266.97 ppbv during the study. The OFP was 760.08 ± 2391.90 μg m-3, and aromatics were the predominant precursors, contributing 54.05% of the total OFP. Furthermore, the SOA estimated by fractional aerosol coefficient (FAC) and time-resolved (TR) methods were 6.032 ± 13.347 μg m-3 and 0.971 ± 4.650 μg m-3, accounting for 8.65-26.39% (13.78 ± 7.46%) and 1.55-4.20% (2.22 ± 1.23%) of the PM2.5 concentrations, respectively. The results indicated that VOCs were more sensitive to O3 pollution in high pollution domains, whereas VOCs were more sensitive to PM2.5 pollution in low pollution domains. We concluded that reducing VOCs emissions might be effective in alleviating photochemical pollution episodes in areas around iron and steel industry, and the haze pollution occurred in these regions may be caused by the primary emission of PM, and the contribution of SOA was relatively small.","Zhang, Xufeng; Gao, Song; Fu, Qingyan; Han, Deming; Chen, Xiaojia; Fu, Shuang; Huang, Xiqian; Cheng, Jinping",Environmental science and pollution research international,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-09218-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418095/,728
134742,,2020-10-01,"OBJECTIVE To evaluate the influence of fluoride varnish (FV) therapies or resin infiltration (RI) to maintain the structural integrity of Molar Incisor Hypomineralization (MIH) affected teeth. METHODS Fifty-one children aged 6-12 years with at least one incisor and one first permanent molar with yellow/brown MIH opacities were included. Patients were randomly allocated into three groups: FV - Fluoride Varnish (Duraphat); FV + etch - Fluoride Varnish (Duraphat) after enamel etching with 37% phosphoric acid; or RI - Resin Infiltration system (Icon). Opacities were monitored for 18-months. The primary outcome was the loss of integrity due to post-eruptive enamel breakdown (PEB). Covariables included sex, age, DMFT index, opacity colour, plaque, number of MIH-affected teeth and surfaces. Fisher's Exact was used to test the association of treatments with PEB, the Kaplan-Meyer method analysed the survival rates and Cox-regression determined which covariables would predict failure (α = 0.05). RESULTS From a total of 235 teeth, the PEB rate for RI (6.1%) was significantly lower than FV (17.9%; OR 3.0, 95%CI 1.07, 8.48) and FV + etch (17.3%; OR 3.1, 95%CI 1.13, 8.73). DMFT index >3, brown opacities, cusp involvement, and age between 6-8 years predicted PEB (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Resin infiltration positively influenced the structural integrity maintenance of MIH-affected teeth by decreasing the risk of enamel breakdown after18 months follow-up.

OBJECTIVE To determine the incidence of COVID-19 among youth soccer athletes and the risk-mitigation practices used by youth soccer organizations. DESIGN Cohort study. SETTING Survey distributed to Elite Clubs National League member clubs. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS Youth soccer club directors throughout the United States. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S) Surveys were completed in late August 2020 regarding the club's current phase of return to soccer (individual only, group noncontact, group contact), date of reinitiation, number of players, cases of COVID-19, and risk-reduction procedures being implemented. Case and incidence rates were compared with national pediatric data and county data from the prior 10 weeks. A negative binomial regression model was developed to predict club COVID-19 cases using the local incidence rate and phase of return as covariates and the log of club player-days as an offset. RESULTS A total of 124 respondents had reinitiated soccer, representing 91 007 players with a median duration of 73 days (interquartile range = 53-83 days) since restarting. Of the 119 clubs that had progressed to group activities, 218 cases of COVID-19 were reported among 85 861 players. Youth soccer players had a lower case rate and incidence rate than children in the United States (254 versus 477 cases per 100 000; incidence rate ratio = 0.511, 95% CI = 0.40, 0.57; P < .001) and the general population in the counties where data were available (268 versus 864 cases per 100 000; incidence rate ratio = 0.202, 95% CI = 0.19, 0.21; P < .001). After adjusting for the local COVID-19 incidence, we found no relationship between the club COVID-19 incidence and the phase of return (noncontact: b = 0.35 ± 0.67, P = .61; contact: b = 0.18 ± 0.67, P = .79). Soccer clubs reported using a median of 8 (interquartile range = 6-10) risk-reduction procedures. CONCLUSIONS The incidence of COVID-19 among youth soccer athletes was relatively low when compared with the background incidence among children in the United States during the summer of 2020. No relationship was identified between the club COVID-19 incidence and the phase of return to soccer.","Watson, Andrew M; Haraldsdottir, Kristin; Biese, Kevin M; Goodavish, Leslie; Stevens, Bethany; McGuine, Timothy A",Journal of athletic training,https://doi.org/10.4085/610-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34375980/,728
134983,,2020-05-01,"BACKGROUND There are limited data on femoropopliteal artery stent thrombosis (ST), which is a serious adverse outcome of peripheral artery interventions. METHODS AND RESULTS Index procedures resulting in femoropopliteal ST were compared with stent procedures without subsequent ST in the Excellence in Peripheral Artery Disease registry. The study data had a total of 724 cases of stent procedures and 604 unique patients. Femoropopliteal ST occurred in 26 of 604 patients (4.3%) over a median follow-up of 6 months post procedure. ST was more likely to occur in men (96.3% versus 82.2%; P=0.026) and to have an initial intervention for chronic total occlusions (88.5% versus 64.0%; P=0.01). There was no significant difference in ST between drug-coated and bare-metal stents (4.4% versus 3.4%; P=0.55), but the rate of ST was significantly higher with self-expanding covered stent grafts compared with bare-metal stents (10.6% versus 3.4%; P=0.02). ST was significantly associated with an increased risk of 12-month major adverse limb events (hazard ratio, 4.99; 95% confidence interval, 2.31-10.77; P<0.001) compared with no ST. On multivariate analysis, treatment of chronic total occlusion lesions (odds ratio, 3.46; 95% confidence interval, 0.98-12.20; P=0.05) and in-stent restenosis lesions (odds ratio, 5.30; 95% confidence interval, 1.83-15.32; P=0.002) were independently associated with an increased risk of ST. CONCLUSIONS In a multicenter peripheral interventional registry, femoropopliteal ST occurred in 4.3% of patients who underwent stent procedures, and it was associated with treatment of chronic total occlusions and in-stent restenosis lesions, and had higher 12-month major adverse limb events.

Our aim was to examine the available evidence regarding the effectiveness of PMHS and MISGP. METHODS Searches were conducted using Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, Scopus and Web of Science, on 11 August 2018. Forward and backward citation searches were conducted, grey literature was searched, and study quality/risk of bias was assessed. Findings were synthesised in a narrative synthesis. Where appropriate, weighted means were calculated. KEY FINDINGS Thirty-two studies were identified for inclusion (17 published articles, 15 conference abstracts). Eighteen studies were conducted within the United Kingdom. Mean quality assessment was moderate (51%), and risk of bias was high (63%). PMHS and MISGP are both typically perceived as positive (e.g. 94% and 91% of participants were satisfied with using a PMHS and MISGP, respectively). For PMHS, the advice received is reported to be usually followed (94%, and 66% for MISGP). For both services, users report several positive outcomes (e.g. problems resolved/avoided, feeling reassured and improved health). PMHS may also be effective for correcting medicines-related errors (up to 39% of calls may concern such errors) and for potentially avoiding medicines-related harm (48% of enquiries concerned situations that were judged to have the potential to harm patients). CONCLUSIONS Findings suggest that both PMHS and MISGP may be beneficial sources of medicines-related support. However, the moderate quality and high risk of bias of studies highlight that more high-quality research is needed.","Williams, Matt; Jordan, Abbie; Scott, Jenny; Jones, Matthew D",The International journal of pharmacy practice,https://doi.org/10.1111/ijpp.12571; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31512292/,728

136236,,2021-02-26,"INTRODUCTION Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is the most common carcinoma to occur in childhood with a peak incidence between 11-17 years, and typically presents with advanced locoregional disease. Pulmonary metastases are seen in up to 46% of cases and should enter the differential diagnosis of miliary nodules seen on chest roentgenogram, even in regions where tuberculosis is endemic. PRESENTATION OF CASE An 11-year-old male presented with a short history of cough, shortness of breath and constitutional symptoms. Examination revealed cervical lymphadenopathy and diffuse bilateral nodular infiltrates on the chest roentgenogram. Investigation for Mycobacterium tuberculosis was negative and this initiated biopsy of a cervical lymph node. Histopathological examination revealed metastatic PTC. Ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed for preoperative staging. The patient subsequently underwent total thyroidectomy with selective neck dissection. DISCUSSION There are several potential causes when dealing with miliary nodules on chest roentgenogram. Thorough interrogation of the clinical, radiological, pathological and microbiological data is required to arrive at the correct diagnosis. Postoperative adjuvant therapy with radioactive iodine is recommended in children with metastatic disease, but this should be restricted preferably to a single dose to avoid the complication of pulmonary fibrosis. CONCLUSION This case highlights the differential diagnostic considerations of a patient presenting with constitutional symptoms and a miliary pattern on chest roentgenogram.

METHODS Six sedated male sheep (weighing 42-54 kg) underwent a controlled hemorrhage until the systolic blood pressure (BP) dropped to <90 mmHg, and were placed into a low capacity Eurocopter AS-350 (France). During the 30-minutes normal flight, every animal underwent blind (left side) and ultrasound-guided (US) (right side) vascular access (VA) to the femoral artery followed by REBOA: the first catheter (Rescue balloon, Japan) - into Zone I, the second one (MIT, Russia) - Zone III. In case of blind VA failure, an alternate US-puncture was attempted. Six experienced flight anesthetists were enrolled into the study. Vascular access and REBOA catheter placement (confirmed by X-Ray later) success rate and timing were recorded. RESULTS Among six blind punctures one was successful, 2/6 - were into the vein, 3/6 - completely failed and switched to US-punctures (making total number of US-punctures nine). Eight out of nine US-punctures were successful. However, correct wire insertion and sheath placement was performed in 1/6 animal in the 'blind' group and only in 6/9 animals in the 'US' group. It took a median of 65 seconds (range 5-260) for US-puncture and a median of 4 minutes to get the sheath in. Among the 9 VAs, there were 2 REBOA failures (1 ruptured balloon [MIT] and 1 mistaken vena cava placement primarily recognized by a sudden drop of BP and later confirmed by X-Ray). Five out of seven balloons were placed in a desired intra-aortic position: 4/5 in Zone I and 1/2 - in Zone III. A median time for a successful REBOA procedure was 5.0 (range 2.5-10.0) minutes (1 min after sheath placement). CONCLUSION Our study demonstrates the potential feasibility of the en-route REBOA which can be performed within 5 minutes. Ultrasound-guidance is critically important to achieve en-route VA.","Reva, Viktor A; Perevedentcev, Andrey V; Pochtarnik, Alexander A; Khupov, Murat T; Kalinina, Angelina A; Samokhvalov, Igor M; Khan, Mansoor A",Injury,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.injury.2020.09.053; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33004204/,728

Given the link between lung disease and aging, we need to understand how molecular indicators of aging relate to lung function and disease. Using data from the population-based KORA (Cooperative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg) surveys, we associated baseline epigenetic (DNA methylation) age acceleration with incident COPD and lung function. Models were adjusted for age, sex, smoking, height, weight, and baseline lung disease as appropriate. Associations were replicated in the Normative Aging Study. Of 770 KORA participants, 131 developed incident COPD over 7 years. Baseline accelerated epigenetic aging was significantly associated with incident COPD. The change in age acceleration (follow-up - baseline) was more strongly associated with COPD than baseline aging alone. The association between the change in age acceleration between baseline and follow-up and incident COPD replicated in the Normative Aging Study. Associations with spirometric lung function parameters were weaker than those with COPD, but a meta-analysis of both cohorts provide suggestive evidence of associations. Accelerated epigenetic aging, both baseline measures and changes over time, may be a risk factor for COPD and reduced lung function.","Breen, Miyuki; Nwanaji-Enwerem, Jamaji C; Karrasch, Stefan; Flexeder, Claudia; Schulz, Holger; Waldenberger, Melanie; Kunze, Sonja; Ollert, Markus; Weidinger, Stefan; Colicino, Elena; Gao, Xu; Wang, Cuicui; Shen, Jincheng; Just, Allan C; Vokonas, Pantel; Sparrow, David; Hou, Lifang; Schwartz, Joel D; Baccarelli, Andrea A; Peters, Annette; Ward-Caviness, Cavin K",Aging,https://doi.org/10.18632/aging.103784; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32747609/,728

139611,,2021-05-01,"BACKGROUND The two basic techniques available in which to perform the gastrojejunal (GJ) anastomosis during a laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGBP) are stapled and handsewn. Few outcomes differences have been noted between the two to recommend one as a superior approach. We present our findings in comparison of the two methods. METHODS This is a retrospective review of all patients who underwent LRYGBP at a single institution during a 3-year period. The two different techniques that were used were a linear stapled and handsewn anastomosis with an anastomotic diameter of 18 mm. The groups were compared for postoperative complications, including stricture, anastomotic leak, and the need for early reoperation. All patients were followed up for a minimum period of 8 months. RESULTS A total of 222 patients were analyzed after excluding 4 patients: 3 for revisional surgery and 1 for conversion to open. There were 99 patients in the stapled group and 123 in the handsewn group. In both groups, patients were predominantly female. The average age was 42.63 in the stapled group and 44.33 in the handsewn group (P = 0.218). Body mass index was 48.23 in the stapled group and 47.91 in the handsewn group (P = 0.733). Stricture rate in the stapled group was 10.1% (10/99) and 4.1% (5/123) in the handsewn group (P = 0.076). Four patients from the stapled group (4.08%) and six from the handsewn group (4.88%) needed early reoperation. One patient in each group had a GJ anastomotic leak (0.9%). There were no deaths. CONCLUSIONS The incidence of anastomotic stricture tends to be lower with a handsewn technique with lower operative time. No difference was appreciated in the anastomotic leak or reexploration rate with either technique.","Kravetz, Amanda J; Reddy, Subhash; Murtaza, Ghulam; Yenumula, Panduranga",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-010-1362-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20927539/,728
139790,,2020-03-11,"BACKGROUND The seroma generated between the abdominal viscera and the prosthesis (retroprosthetic seroma), after laparoscopic ventral hernia repair (LVHR) with the implant of an intraperitoneal mesh is an unknown entity with few references in the literature. Our objective is to analyze its incidence, clinical repercussions and course of retroprosthetic seroma during the first 3 months post-operation and the factors related to its appearance, such as the relationship to preprosthetic seroma, the size of the prosthesis and the patient BMI. MATERIALS AND METHODS Prospective, descriptive study in patients undergoing LVHR using the double crown technique. After surgery, the patients had follow-ups on the seventh day and the first and third months post-operation with clinical examination and abdominal CT scan. The study endpoints were: incidence and volume of retroprosthetic seroma, clinical repercussions, relationship to body mass index (BMI), prosthesis size and the existence of preprosthetic seroma. RESULTS Fifty patients underwent LVHR using the double crown technique and were included in the study. The incidence of retroprosthetic seroma during the 3-month follow-up was 46%, there being a progressive process of spontaneous reabsorption. In just one patient (2%) there were clinical repercussions as a result of the seroma. No statistically significant relationship was found with BMI and preprosthetic seroma. A statistical relationship was found between the size of the prosthesis and the risk of suffering retroprosthetic seroma in the third month post-operation (p = 0.048). CONCLUSIONS Retroprosthetic seroma is an entity produced in 46% of patients undergoing LVHR with few clinical repercussions (2%). In most cases it develops in the first week post-operation and then undergoes a reabsorption process that is usually complete by the third month post-operation. The size of the prosthesis delays the reabsorption process.","Morales-Conde, S; Suarez-Artacho, G; Socas-Macias, M; Barranco-Moreno, A",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10029-015-1352-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25665683/,728

141562,,2020-12-02,"PURPOSE The AngioVac catheter system is a mechanical suction device designed for removal of intravascular material using extracorporeal veno-venous bypass circuit. The purpose of this study is to present the outcomes in patients treated with the AngioVac aspiration system and to discuss its efficacy in different vascular beds. MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospectively review was performed of seven patients treated with AngioVac between October 2013 and December 2014. In 6/7 cases, the AngioVac cannula was inserted percutaneously and the patient was placed on veno-venous bypass. In one of the cases, the cannula was inserted directly into the Fontan circuit after sternotomy and the patient was maintained on cardiopulmonary bypass. Thrombus location included iliocaval (2), SVC (1), pulmonary arteries (1), Fontan circuit and Glenn shunt with pulmonary artery extension (1), right atrium (1), and IVC with renal vein extension (1). RESULTS The majority of thrombus (50-95%) was removed in 5/7 cases, and partial thrombus removal (<50%) was confirmed in 2/7 cases. Mean follow-up was 205 days (range 64-403 days). All patients were alive at latest follow-up. Minor complications included three neck hematomas in two total patients. No major complications occurred. CONCLUSION AngioVac is a useful tool for acute thrombus removal in the large vessels. The setup and substantial cost may limit its application in straightforward cases. More studies are needed to establish the utility of AngioVac in treatment of intravascular and intracardiac material.","Salsamendi, Jason; Doshi, Mehul; Bhatia, Shivank; Bordegaray, Matthew; Arya, Rahul; Morton, Connor; Narayanan, Govindarajan",Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00270-015-1152-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26067804/,728

The epicentre of the outbreak was Wuhan in the People's Republic of China. In order to control the outbreak, Chinese leaders called on the city authorities in Wuhan to set up mass quarantine centres for infected people. The Chinese government took this step to protect the public against infectious disease. This is an example of the conflicts between public health and civil liberties/individual rights. Government authority is the pillar of the public health law. The government retains the power to achieve and maintain common good by restricting - within solid international and national limits - individual rights concerning autonomy, privacy, association, and liberty. Public health agencies have the right to collect, use, and disclose a considerable amount of personal health information and to enforce certain vaccinations, medical examinations, and treatments. In addition to the power to isolate individuals to protect the public against the spread of infectious disease, their powers can be used to control businesses and professions. There are several legal interventions to prevent injury and disease and promote the public's health. Among these tools are taxing policies, which encourage engaging in beneficial behaviour (fruit consumption) and disincentives to engage in high-risk activities (smoking).","Onisoyonivosekume, Dede; Mahrouseh, Nour; Varga, Orsolya",Studies in health technology and informatics,https://doi.org/10.3233/shti200660; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32990661/,728
141873,,2020-10-21,"OBJECTIVE To explore the outcomes of monthly video consultations for children with diabetes. METHODS The Virtual Outpatient Diabetes Clinic for Children and Youth (VIDIKI) was a 6-month multicenter controlled clinical trial followed by an extension phase. The 240 participants (1-16 years), all using a CGM, were quasi-randomized by residence location to the intervention group (IG) or the waitlist-control group (WG). The IG started immediately after enrollment with monthly video consultations as an add-on to regular care, while the WG received regular care for 6 months before starting the intervention. The extension phase lasted between 12 months and 2 years, depending on the enrollment date. Linear regression was applied to model the primary outcome of HbA1c after 6 months and other metabolic and psychosocial outcomes. RESULTS After covariate adjustments, the HbA1c at 6 months-corresponding to the controlled treatment phase-was 0.11% lower in the IG than that in the WG (95% CI -0.31 to 0.09, p = 0.277). For the total study sample, a significant HbA1c improvement was found after 12 months of video consultations, which increased further until month 15. The diabetes burden of the main caregivers was lower, and parental treatment satisfaction was significantly higher in the IG than that in the WG. CONCLUSIONS The VIDIKI study found no significant HbA1c difference between IG and WG after 6 months in the controlled phase, but there was a decreased diabetes burden and increased treatment satisfaction for the parents. In the longitudinal perspective, a significant HbA1c improvement was found after 12 and 15 months. This article is protected by copyright.

The use of biodegradable polymers obviates the need for a second surgery to remove the implant, which is the case when a nondegradable implant is used. After implantation in the body, biomedical devices may be subjected to degradation and erosion. Understanding the mechanisms of these processes is essential for the development of biomedical devices or implants with a specific function, for example, scaffolds for tissue-engineering applications. For the engineering and regeneration of soft tissues (e.g., blood vessels, cardiac muscle and peripheral nerves), biodegradable polymers are needed that are flexible and elastic. The scaffolds prepared from these polymers should have tuneable degradation properties and should perform well under long-term cyclic deformation conditions. The required polymers, which are either physically or chemically crosslinked biodegradable elastomers, are reviewed in this article.","Bat, Erhan; Zhang, Zheng; Feijen, Jan; Grijpma, Dirk W; Poot, André A",Regenerative medicine,https://doi.org/10.2217/rme.14.4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24935047/,728

Herein, we synthesized an ortho ester-linked deoxycholic acid dimer (DCA-OE), which could effectively self-assemble with doxorubicin (DOX) to form stable nanoparticles (DCA-OE/DOX NPs) by a single emulsion method. DCA-based nanoparticles had a desirable size (∼200 nm), morphology (spherical shape), and high drug encapsulation (drug loading content of ∼18.0 %, drug loading efficiency of ∼77.6 %). DCA-OE could improve the stability and solubility of DOX in physiological environment, while pH-sensitive ortho ester linkage endowed the ability to release DOX quickly in cancer cells. In vitro cytotoxicity and apoptosis verified drug-loaded dimer nanoparticles had similar toxicity with free DOX. Besides, these particles could efficiently accumulate and penetrate into human liver carcinoma cell line (HepG2) multicellular spheroids, thus resulting in enhanced antitumor effect. In vivo tests further exhibited that DCA-OE/DOX NPs had lower systemic toxicity and higher tumor inhibition effect, and its tumor inhibition rate was 84.1 %, which was far more than free DOX (49.3 %). Therefore, the strategy to link functional small molecules with ortho ester has great potentials in specific delivery of anticancer drugs.","Xu, Jiaxi; Fang, Qin; Yang, Longshun; Gao, Jialu; Xue, Yanbing; Wang, Xin; Tang, Rupei","Colloids and surfaces.

144023,,2020-12-22,"BACKGROUND Resistance training has been recommended as an effective measure against age-related loss of muscle mass and muscle strength, called sarcopenia, even in older adults. However, despite subjecting each participant to the same training program, the training effect solely depended on the individual. This study aimed to evaluate whether certain blood parameters influenced the effect of a low-load resistance training program on muscle thickness in the community-dwelling elderly population. METHODS Sixty-nine community-dwelling Japanese (49 women and 20 men) subjects aged 69.4 ± 6.5 years were included. Low-load resistance training was performed twice a week for 12 weeks. Muscle thickness at the anterior aspects of the thigh (AT) was measured using a B-mode ultrasound device, and 22 blood parameter levels were assessed before and after the program. We checked the first quartile value of each parameter to establish cutoff values, and participants were divided into low or normal groups for each parameter. RESULTS A low-load resistance training program significantly increased muscle thickness at the AT. The interaction between time and groups was examined at low (< 4.1 g/dL) versus normal (≥ 4.1 g/dL) serum albumin (Alb) levels. Although there was no difference in muscle thickness at the AT before the training intervention, the hypertrophic effects were higher in the normal serum Alb level group than in the low serum Alb level group. The binomial logistic regression analysis showed that participants in the low serum Alb group had an odds ratio of 7.08 for decreased muscle thickness at the AT. The effect of a low-load resistance training program on lower limb muscle thickness appears to be limited in participants with low serum Alb levels before training interventions. CONCLUSIONS Serum Alb level may act as a biomarker to predict the effects of low-load resistance training programs on muscle hypertrophy in elderly individuals.

RESULTS Of all 13,639 patients in ETNA-AF-Europe, 2579 were from BeNe. BeNe patients were younger than OEC patients (mean age: 72.3 vs 73.9 years), and had lower CHA2DS2-VASc (mean: 2.8 vs 3.2) and HAS-BLED scores (mean: 2.4 vs 2.6). Patients from BeNe less often had hypertension (61.6% vs 80.4%), and/or diabetes mellitus (17.3% vs 23.1%) than patients from OEC. Moreover, relatively fewer patients in BeNe were prescribed the reduced dose of 30 mg edoxaban (14.8%) than in OEC (25.4%). Overall, edoxaban was dosed according to label in 83.1% of patients. Yet, 30 mg edoxaban was prescribed in the absence of any dose reduction criteria in 36.9% of 30 mg users (5.5% of all patients) in BeNe compared with 35.5% (9.0% of all patients) in OEC. CONCLUSION There were several notable differences between BeNe and OEC regarding clinical characteristics and dosing practices in patients prescribed edoxaban, which are relevant for the local implementation of dose evaluation and optimisation.

DATA SOURCES The Cochrane, Embase, PsycINFO and PubMed databases were searched for studies published between 1983 and December 2019. The reference lists of included studies were additionally examined and Scopus citation searches conducted. REVIEW METHODS Study screening and data extraction were independently completed by two reviewers. Randomised controlled trials comparing motivational interviewing interventions for multiple sclerosis to usual care, wait-list or other active intervention controls were examined. Studies were assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Standardised mean differences (Hedges' g), 95% confidence intervals and P values were calculated for all health and behavioural outcomes. RESULTS Ten randomised controlled trials, involving a pooled sample of 987 adults with relapsing-remitting or progressive multiple sclerosis and mild to moderate impairment, were identified. Most trials had a low or unclear risk of methodological bias. Motivational interviewing, when used in conjunction with other counselling or rehabilitation techniques, resulted in significant immediate medium-to-very large improvements in multiple physical, psychological, social and behavioural outcomes (range: g = .34-2.68). Maintenance effects were promising (range: g = .41-1.11), although less frequently assessed (Nstudies = 5) and of limited duration (1-7 months).

147325,,2020-12-07,"Existence and biomedical relevance of the neurenteric canal, a transient midline structure during early neurulation in the human embryo, have been controversially discussed for more than a century by embryologists and clinicians alike. In this study, the authors address the long-standing enigma by high-resolution histology and three-dimensional reconstruction using new and historic histological sections of 5 human 17- to 21-day-old embryos and of 2 marmoset monkey embryos of the species Callithrix jacchus at corresponding stages. The neurenteric canal presents itself as the classical vertical connection between the amniotic cavity and the yolk sac cavity and is lined (a) craniolaterally by a horseshoe-shaped ""hinge of involuting notochordal cells"" within Hensen's node and (b) caudally by the receding primitive streak epiblast dorsally and by notochordal plate epithelium ventrally, the latter of which covered the (longitudinal) notochordal canal on its ventral side at the preceding stage. Furthermore, asymmetric parachordal nodal expression in Callithrix and morphological asymmetries within the nodes of the other specimens suggest an early non-cilium-dependent left-right symmetry breaking mode previously postulated for other mammals. We conclude that structure and position of the mammalian neurenteric canal support the notion of its homology with the reptilian blastopore as a whole and with a dorsal segment of the blastopore in amphibia. These new features of the neurenteric canal may further clarify the aetiology of foetal malformations such as junctional neurulation defects, neuroendodermal cysts, and the split notochord syndrome.","Rulle, Alexander; Tsikolia, Nikoloz; de Bakker, Bernadette; Drummer, Charis; Behr, Rüdiger; Viebahn, Christoph","Cells, tissues, organs",https://doi.org/10.1159/000493276; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30481762/,728
147475,,2020-04-01,"The purpose of this investigation was to assess the effect of compression sleeves on muscle activation cost during locomotion. Twenty-two recreationally active men (age: 25 ± 3 years) ran on a treadmill at four different speeds (ordered sequence of 2.8, 3.3, 2.2, and 3.9 m/s). The tests were performed without (control situation, CON) and while wearing specially designed lower leg compression sleeves (SL). Myoelectric activity of five lower leg muscles (tibialis anterior, fibularis longus, lateral and medial head of gastrocnemius, and soleus) was captured using Surface EMG. To assess muscle activation cost, the cumulative muscle activity per distance travelled (CMAPD) of the CON and SL situations was determined. Repeated measures analyses of variance were performed separately for each muscle. The analyses revealed a reduced lower leg muscle activation cost with respect to test situation for SL for all muscles (p < 0.05, ηp2 > 0.18). The respective significant reductions of CMAPD values during SL ranged between 4% and 16% and were largest at 2.8 m/s. The findings presented point towards an improved muscle activation cost while wearing lower leg compression sleeves during locomotion that have potential to postpone muscle fatigue.","Kurz, Eduard; Anders, Christoph",Journal of sports sciences,https://doi.org/10.1080/02640414.2018.1439355; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29447545/,728

However, the chronology of the histological lesions has not been well established. OBJECTIVE To describe the chronological histopathological alterations in the lungs of patients with COVID-19 related ARDS. DESIGN A prospective cohort study was carried out. SETTING Intensive Care Unit of a tertiary hospital. PATIENTS The first 22 consecutive COVID-19 deaths. MEASUREMENTS Lung biopsies and histopathological analyses were performed in deceased patients with COVID-19 related ARDS. Clinical data and patient course were evaluated. RESULTS The median patient age was 66 [63-74] years; 73% were males. The median duration of mechanical ventilation was 17 [8-24] days. COVID-19 induced pulmonary injury was characterized by an exudative phase in the first week of the disease, followed by a proliferative/organizing phase in the second and third weeks, and finally an end-stage fibrosis phase after the third week. Viral RNA and proteins were detected in pneumocytes and macrophages in a very early stage of the disease, and were no longer detected after the second week. LIMITATION Limited sample size.

In particular, lung lesions consistent with potentially corticosteroid-sensitive lesions are seen.","Merdji, H; Mayeur, S; Schenck, M; Oulehri, W; Clere-Jehl, R; Cunat, S; Herbrecht, J-E; Janssen-Langenstein, R; Nicolae, A; Helms, J; Meziani, F; Chenard, M-P",Medicina intensiva,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.medine.2021.02.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34059216/,728
149299,,2021-06-05,"BACKGROUND Paramedics respond to emergency scenes in often uncontrolled settings without being aware of potential risks. This makes paramedicine one of the most dangerous occupations. One of these dangers is the risk of contracting infectious diseases. Research in this area is predominantly focused on compliance in the use of protective equipment, attitudes and perceptions of paramedics, infectious disease policy, and exposure rates to blood and body fluids. The purpose of this scoping review was to determine what is known about the impact of infectious disease on the health of paramedics. METHODS Using the Arskey and O'Malley methodological framework, a scoping review was undertaken, which allows for a broad search of the available evidence. RESULTS The literature search identified eight articles for review that reported on paramedic exposure trends; the lack of reported blood-borne infections contracted, such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); instances of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) infections; and the higher prevalence of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) nasal infections amongst paramedics. CONCLUSIONS Exposure to infectious diseases is decreasing, yet it remains significant. The decrease is attributed to prevention strategies; however, paramedic knowledge and attitudes as well as the uncontrolled environment paramedics work in can be a barrier. Contraction of infectious diseases is generally low; exceptions to this are MRSA colonization, influenza, and SARS. Paramedics are at greater risk of acquiring these infectious diseases compared to the general public. The effect on the health of paramedics is not well reported. Thomas B , O'Meara P , Spelten E .

149373,,2020,"Background: Facial palsy is a frequent and debilitating sequela of stroke and brain injury, causing functional and aesthetic deficits as well as significant adverse effects on quality of life and well-being. Current literature reports many cases of acquired facial palsy that do not recover spontaneously, and more information is needed regarding the efficacy of physical therapies used in this population. Methods: A systematic search of eight electronic databases was performed from database inception to December 2018. Gray literature searches were then performed to identify additional articles. Studies were included if they addressed physical rehabilitation interventions for adults with acquired facial palsy. Reasons for exclusion were documented. Independent data extraction, quality assessment, and risk of bias assessment followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Results: Following abstract screening, a total of 13 full-text articles were identified for independent screening by two reviewers. This included four randomized control trials, two non-randomized control trials, one cohort study, and six prospective case series studies. Twelve out of the 13 included studies reported on facial palsy as a sequela of stroke. A total of 539 participants received intervention for facial palsy across the 13 included studies. Therapy design, length and frequency of intervention varied across the studies, and a wide range of outcome measures were used. Improvement on various outcome measures was reported across all 13 studies. The quality of the evidence was low overall, and most studies were found to have high risk of bias. Conclusions: All the studies in this review report improvement of facial movement or function following application of various methods of physical rehabilitation for facial palsy. Methodological limitations and heterogeneity of design affect the strength of the evidence and prevent reliable comparison between intervention methods. Strong evidence supporting physical rehabilitation was not found; well-designed rigorous research is required.","Vaughan, Annabelle; Gardner, Danielle; Miles, Anna; Copley, Anna; Wenke, Rachel; Coulson, Susan",Frontiers in neurology,https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2020.00222; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32296385/,728

We investigated the association between the C-reactive protein (CRP) to albumin ratio (CAR) and in-hospital mortality in patients with hypertensive COVID-19. A total of 176 patients with hypertension diagnosed with COVID-19 were included in this study. The CAR was compared between survivors and nonsurvivors. Logistic regression analysis was used to detect independent predictors of mortality due to COVID-19 in patients with hypertension. A cutoff value of CAR was obtained for predicting in-hospital death in patients with hypertensive COVID-19. Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed for survival analysis in the study population. The CAR values were significantly higher in nonsurvivors than in survivors with hypertension. Moreover, the CAR was an independent predictor of in-hospital death in patients with hypertensive COVID-19, as shown in multivariable logistic regression analysis. Receiver operating characteristic analysis yielded a cutoff value of 20.75 for the CAR for predicting in-hospital death in patients with hypertension. Kaplan-Meier curve analysis showed that patients with hypertensive COVID-19 with a CAR value of ≥20.75 had a higher incidence of in-hospital death.

150484,,2021-02-27,"SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic. This novel coronavirus emerged in China, quickly spreading to more than 200 countries worldwide. Although most patients are only mildly ill or even asymptomatic, some develop severe pneumonia and become critically ill. One of the biggest unanswered questions is why some develop severe disease, whilst others do not. Insight on the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and the immune system and the contribution of dysfunctional immune responses to disease progression will be instrumental to the understanding of COVID-19 pathogenesis, risk factors for worst outcome, and rational design of effective therapies and vaccines. In this review we have gathered the knowledge available thus far on the epidemiology of SARS-COV-2 infection, focusing on the susceptibility of older individuals, SARS-CoV-2-host cell interaction during infection and the immune response directed at SARS-CoV-2. Dendritic cells act as crucial messengers linking innate and adaptative immunity against viral infections. Thus, this review also brings a focused discussion on the role of dendritic cells and their immune functions during SARS-CoV-2 infection and how immune evasion strategies of SARS-CoV-2 and advancing age mediate dendritic cell dysfunctions that contribute to COVID-19 pathogenesis and increased susceptibility to worst outcomes. This review brings to light the hypothesis that concomitant occurrence of dendritic cell dysfunction/cytopathic effects induced by SARS-CoV-2 and/or aging may influence disease outcome in the elderly. Lastly, a detailed discussion on the effects and mechanisms of action of drugs currently being tested for COVID-19 on the function of dendritic cells is also provided.","Borges, Rodrigo Cerqueira; Hohmann, Miriam Sayuri; Borghi, Sergio Marques",International reviews of immunology,https://doi.org/10.1080/08830185.2020.1844195; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33191813/,728
150620,,2021-06-01,"This study investigates the changes in soldiers' brain executive function at different altitude environments and their relationship with blood oxygen saturation. Stratified sampling was conducted in different altitude 133 active-duty soldiers who were stationed in Weinan (347 m, n = 34), Nyingchi (2,950 m, n = 32), Lhasa (3,860 m, n = 33), and Nagqu (4,890 m, n = 34) for 2 years. The Go/NoGo paradigm with event-related potentials (ERPs) and event-related oscillations (EROs) was used to explore the time and neural oscillation courses of response inhibition. Behavioral results revealed that at the 4,890-m altitude area, the soldiers had the highest false alarm rate, the longest reaction time, and the slowest information transmission rate. The electrophysiological results revealed that NoGo-N2 and N2d decreased with increasing altitude, with significant changes at 3,860 m; the amplitudes of NoGo-P3 and P3d in plateau groups were significantly more negative than the plain and changed significantly at 2,950 m. The results of correlation analysis showed that NoGo-P3 was negatively correlated with altitude (r = -0.358, p = 0.000), positively correlated with SpO2 (r = 0.197, p = 0.041) and information translation rate (ITR) (r = 0.202, p = 0.036). P3d was negatively correlated with altitude (r = -0.276, p = 0.004) and positively correlated with ITR (r = 0.228, p = 0.018). N2d was negatively correlated with ITR (r = 0.204, p = 0.034). The power spectrum analysis of NoGo-N2 and NoGo-P3 showed that the power of δ and θ bands at the plateau area was significantly lower than the plain area and showed a significant step-by-step decrease; the α-band power increases significantly only in the area of 4,890 m. The effect of chronic hypoxia exposure at different altitudes of the plateau on the response inhibition of soldiers was manifested: 3,860 m was the altitude at which the brain response inhibition function decreased during the conflict monitoring stage, and 2,950 m was the altitude at which it dropped during the response inhibition stage. In addition, the soldier's brain's executive function was closely related to SpO2, and a reduction in SpO2 may lead to a decline in response inhibition.","Wei, Xin; Ni, Xiaoli; Zhao, Shanguang; Chi, Aiping",Frontiers in physiology,https://doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2021.632058; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33935798/,728
150863,,2020-11-02,"Objective: This study aimed to explore the usefulness of the peripheral blood eosinophil count (PBEC) in assessing the level of fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) and predicting bronchodilation test results. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the data of 384 outpatients who underwent FeNO measurement at our Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine from March to June 2019. The FeNO level was compared among different PBECs to explore the association among them. Furthermore, the sensitivity and specificity of PBECs in predicting bronchodilation test results were assessed by using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Results: There was a moderate correlation between PBECs and FeNO levels (r = 0.414; p < 0.05). In the subjects with PBECs ≥ 0.3 × 109/L, the median FeNO level was 39 ppb (interquartile range, 22.5-65.5 ppb), significantly higher than in the subjects with PBECs < 0.3 × 109/L. The area under the ROC curve was 0.707 (p < 0.05). The maximum Youden index (0.348) was at PBECs = 0.205 × 109/L, which achieved sensitivity and specificity of 63% and 71.8%, respectively. Conclusion: PBECs ≥ 0.3 × 109/L can predict a positive bronchodilation test result and a high FeNO level, with a probability of 50% in the subjects with chronic cough and shortness of breath; in the absence of corresponding symptoms and a low PBEC, the predictive value was small. For hospitals not able to conduct FeNO measurements, for outpatients with poor economic conditions, and for patients with confirmed or suspected novel coronavirus disease 2019, the PBEC, in conjunction with a patient's clinical symptoms, can improve the diagnostic accuracy of allergic asthma and assessment of airway inflammation while reducing the risk of infection.","Zhao, Bo; Zheng, Haiming; Li, Xiaopan; Zheng, Rui",Allergy and asthma proceedings,https://doi.org/10.2500/aap.2021.42.210016; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33980336/,728
151181,,2020-10-19,"OBJECTIVE To compare pursestring, Witzel (seromuscular inversion), and seromuscular incision jejunostomy tube placement techniques in vitro. SAMPLE Jejunal specimens from 10 dogs. PROCEDURES Jejunal segments (50 cm) were harvested immediately prior to euthanasia from 10 mixed-breed dogs Specimens were harvested with the orad and aborad ends clamped and stored in saline (0.9% NaCl) solution-soaked towels during instrumentation. Three jejunostomy tubes were placed via 3 techniques (pursestring, Witzel, and seromuscular incision), and 2 double lumen central venous catheters were placed at each intestinal end for luminal filling and leak testing. Intestinal luminal area was measured ultrasonographically with specimens suspended in a warm undyed saline solution bath with the intestinal lumen filled with dyed saline solution (intraluminal pressure, 6 mm Hg). Leak testing was performed by means of infusion of dyed saline solution (4 mL/min) until each jejunostomy site failed. Intestinal luminal area and leakage pressure were compared between the 3 tube placement techniques. RESULTS The Witzel and seromuscular incision techniques decreased the intestinal luminal area measured at the tube insertion site, albeit nonsignificantly. For the seromuscular incision technique, a significant decrease in intestinal luminal area at the intraluminal site of measurement was found. For 2/30 specimens (1/10 pursestring and 1/10 seromuscular incision), failure occurred at pressures within the range of previously reported peak peristaltic pressure for dogs. Failure occurred at supraphysiologic peristaltic pressures for the remaining 28 specimens, including all 10 specimens for the Witzel technique. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE In this in vitro study, all specimens for the Witzel technique withstood physiologic peristaltic pressures during leak testing. Both tunneling techniques (Witzel and seromuscular incision) created a decrease in intestinal luminal area. Further investigation, including in vivo testing, is indicated to evaluate the clinical relevance of these findings.","Risselada, Marije; Ellison, Gary W; Winter, Matthew D; Giglio, Robson F; Shih, Andre; Hernandez, Jorge A; Griffith, Emily",American journal of veterinary research,https://doi.org/10.2460/ajvr.76.5.467; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25909380/,728

Typical patterns of clinical and laboratory features match secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH). However, the optimal approach to COVID-19 patients testing positive for sHLH is still unclear. PATIENT CONCERNS Three patients with COVID-19 are reviewed. All showed hyperinflammation and cytokine storm, necessitating intensive care treatment including mechanical ventilation. DIAGNOSIS Secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis due to severe COVID-19; diagnosed via HScore. INTERVENTIONS A treatment regimen of methylprednisolone, pentaglobin, and anakinra was developed and administered. OUTCOMES One patient survived the ICU stay. Two other patients, in whom sHLH was diagnosed too late, deceased. LESSONS A routine screening of COVID-19 patients for secondary HLH by using the HScore is feasible; especially those patients deteriorating clinically with no sufficient response to shock management might be at particular high risk. A stepwise therapeutic approach comprising corticosteroids, immunoglobulins and anakinra, accompanied by immunoadsorption, may dampen cytokine storm effects, and potentially reduce mortality.","Schnaubelt, Sebastian; Tihanyi, Daniel; Strassl, Robert; Schmidt, Ralf; Anders, Sonja; Laggner, Anton N; Agis, Hermine; Domanovits, Hans",Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000025170; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33761694/,728

152081,,2021-03-25,"For the field of virology, perhaps one of the most paradigm-shifting events so far in the 21st century was the identification of the giant double-stranded DNA virus that infects amoebae. Remarkably, this virus, known as Mimivirus, has a genome that encodes for nearly 1000 proteins, some of which are involved in the biosynthesis of unusual sugars. Indeed, the virus is coated by a layer of glycosylated fibers that contain d-glucose, N-acetyl-d-glucosamine, l-rhamnose, and 4-amino-4,6-dideoxy-d-glucose. Here we describe a combined structural and enzymological investigation of the protein encoded by the open-reading frame L780, which corresponds to an l-rhamnose synthase. The structure of the L780/NADP+ /UDP-l-rhamnose ternary complex was determined to 1.45 Å resolution and refined to an overall R-factor of 19.9 %. Each subunit of the dimeric protein adopts a bilobal-shaped appearance with the N-terminal domain harboring the dinucleotide binding site and the C-terminal domain positioning the UDP-sugar into the active site. The overall molecular architecture of L780 places it into the short chain dehydrogenase/reductase superfamily. Kinetic analyses indicate that the enzyme can function on either UDP- and dTDP-sugars but displays a higher catalytic efficiency with the UDP-linked substrate. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments suggest that both Cys 108 and Lys 175 play key roles in catalysis. This structure represents the first model of a viral UDP-l-rhamnose synthase and provides new details into these fascinating enzymes. This article is protected by copyright.

We postulated that a minimally invasive surgical treatment might reduce the number of complications related to open surgery and improve the functional results. METHOD We enrolled 47 patients with acute Achilles tendon ruptures in a prospective, randomised trial to compare clinical results and complications between a minimally invasive procedure with the Achillon(®) device and traditional open surgery with Krackow-type sutures. The average patient age was 46 years. The follow up time was 24 months. RESULTS No Achilles tendon re-rupture or nerve injury occurred in treated patients. There were two cases of wound infections in the open surgery group, and one superficial wound infection occurred in the minimally invasive group. The groups were not significantly different in the amount of pain, range of ankle movements, the single heel-rise test, calf circumference, or time to return to work and sports.

We describe a small series (n = 5) of patients who underwent a hybrid PD for treatment of obstructive jaundice and pancreatic mass. METHODS After diagnostic laparoscopy, the gallbladder was retracted cephalad and the porta hepatis was dissected. The lesser sac was opened to expose the superior mesenteric vein below the pancreas. Once the vein was cleared, the bile duct, stomach, pancreas, and jejunum were transected. After the uncinate process was cleared, the specimen was removed. The da Vinci S Surgical Robotic System was docked to perform a mucosa-to-mucosa pancreaticojejunostomy and an end-to-side choledochojejunostomy. A stapled gastrojejunostomy and drain placement completed the operation. RESULTS Five patients underwent hybrid PD between May 2006 and June 2007. All patients had a history of pancreatitis and presented with obstructive jaundice and a pancreatic mass. The operations were completed with 5 ports. The mean operative time was 7 hours. The mean hospital stay was 9.6 days. At 6 months after the operation, all patients were disease-free.

Guidelines are needed to help policymakers decide whether mandatory notification of an infectious disease is appropriate. We developed a decision aid, based on a range of criteria previously used in the Netherlands or in other regions to help decide whether to make a disease notifiable. Criteria were categorised as being effective, feasible and necessary with regard to the relevance of mandatory notification. Expert panels piloted the decision aid. Here we illustrate its use for three diseases (Vibrio vulnificus infection, chronic Q fever and dengue fever) for which mandatory notification was requested. For dengue fever, the expert panel advised mandatory notification; for V. vulnificus infection and chronic Q fever, the expert panel concluded that mandatory notification was not (yet) justified. Use of the decision aid led to a structured, transparent decision making process and a thorough assessment of the advantages and disadvantages of mandatory notification of these diseases. It also helped identify knowledge gaps that required further research before a decision could be made. We therefore recommend use of this aid for public health policy making.","Bijkerk, Paul; Fanoy, Ewout B; Kardamanidis, Katina; van der Plas, Simone M; Te Wierik, Margreet J; Kretzschmar, Mirjam E; Haringhuizen, George B; van Vliet, Hans J; van der Sande, Marianne A",Euro surveillance : bulletin Europeen sur les maladies transmissibles = European communicable disease bulletin,https://doi.org/10.2807/1560-7917.es.2015.20.34.30003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26530302/,728

155194,,2016,"PURPOSE Our study investigated the impact of coronary artery calcification (CAC) and systemic inflammation on risks for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) following percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). BACKGROUND CAC and systemic inflammation are known to be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events. METHODS A total of 17,711 consecutive patients who underwent PCI in our hospital between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2015 were categorized according to the degree of CAC (moderate/severe vs. none/mild) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) level (≥2 vs. <2 mg/L). MACE was defined as death, myocardial infarction (MI), or target vessel revascularization (TVR) occurring over 1 year. RESULTS Within the four groups, patients with both moderate/severe CAC and elevated hsCRP (n = 1,814 [10.2%]) were older with more comorbid risk factors compared to those with moderate/severe CAC alone (n = 1,687 [9.5%]), elevated hsCRP alone (n = 7,597 [42.9%]) or neither abnormality (n = 6,613 [37.3%]). The analogous 1-year MACE rates were 21.2, 14.9, 11.5, and 7.8%, respectively (p-trend < .001). Results were unchanged after multivariable adjustment, suggesting synergistic adverse effects in patients with both CAC and elevated hsCRP. CONCLUSIONS The presence of both moderate/severe CAC and systemic inflammation confers a synergistic effect on risk for MACE following PCI, indicating the need for novel or more intense therapeutic interventions to mitigate risk in such patients.","Aoi, Shunsuke; Baber, Usman; Kovacic, Jason C; Mehran, Roxana; Aquino, Melissa; Dangas, George; Sweeny, Joseph; Vijay, Pooja; Shah, Srushti; Barman, Nitin; Moreno, Pedro; Kini, Annapoorna S; Sharma, Samin K",Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,https://doi.org/10.1002/ccd.28784; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32087000/,728
155512,,2021-03-23,"BACKGROUND Dental professionals are at great risk of contracting coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). OBJECTIVES The objectives of this study were to determine the levels of stress and anxiety among dental professionals, and to determine which dental procedures cause the greatest amount of stress and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIAL AND METHODS This cross-sectional survey was conducted by requesting voluntary participation of dental healthcare workers through the authors' own e-form, which consisted of our self-developed questionnaire, the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 scale (GAD-7). The simple and multiple linear regression analyses were used to assess the effect of dental procedures and other factors associated with stress and anxiety among the participants. A p-value ≤0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS This survey included 85 participants (32 males, 53 females) with a mean age of 31.6 ±6.0 years. Significant associations were found between severe stress for scaling (p < 0.001; p < 0.001), complex fillings (p < 0.001; p < 0.001), root canal treatment (RCT) (p = 0.001; p = 0.007), crown and bridge work (p < 0.001; p < 0.001), denture work (p = 0.034; p = 0.001), third molar extractions (p < 0.001; p < 0.001), surgical procedures (p < 0.001; p = 0.001), and implant placement (p = 0.001; p = 0.022) and the PSS and GAD-7 scores, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Dental healthcare workers exhibit severe stress and anxiety associated with elective dental procedures. Dental emergencies should take precedence and elective dental treatment should be carried out with utmost caution, ensuring all protective measures. Psychological support for dental healthcare professionals should be made accessible.","Kamal, Adeel Tahir; Sukhia, Rashna Hoshang; Ghandhi, Dinaz; Sukhia, Hoshang Rumi",Dental and medical problems,https://doi.org/10.17219/dmp/131115; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33929792/,728

At autopsy, the liver, spleen, and mesenteric lymph node were enlarged, and white foci were observed on the outer surface of the liver. The outer surface of the mesenteric lymph node was dark red. Histologically, granulomas were observed in the liver, spleen, bone marrow, and lymph nodes, composed mainly of aggregated epithelioid macrophages, some of which were positive to an anti-feline coronavirus (FCoV; Alphacoronavirus 1) antibody in immunohistochemistry. Mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis was observed, and periodic acid-Schiff-positive deposits were observed along glomerular capillary walls. These deposits stained pale red with periodic acid-methenamine silver stain and red with Masson trichrome stain, and were also observed in the mesangial matrix. In affected glomeruli, glomerular capillary walls and mesangial areas were positive for anti-ferret immunoglobulin G. By electron microscopy, subepithelial and mesangial electron-dense deposits were observed consistent with immune complex deposition.

156978,,2020,"Race-related biases and discrimination and easily observable race-related characteristics, such as skin color, appear to go hand and hand, but it remains unclear how these factors work together to shape youth development. The current study addresses this gap by investigating skin color satisfaction as a mediator between perceptions of discrimination and adjustment. Data are from a cross-sectional sample of Latinx youth (N = 175; Mage = 12.86; 51.4% female; 86.9% US-born) who completed measures of foreigner-based objectification, peer discrimination, adult discrimination, self-esteem, depressive symptoms, and the importance or value attributed to academic success. Evidence of significant indirect effects of skin color satisfaction in the links between foreigner-based objectification and self-esteem as well as academic importance was found. Skin color satisfaction did not mediate links between either peer or adult discrimination and self-esteem, depression, and academic importance. The results provide support that being perceived as a foreigner has negative implications for Latinx youth adjustment through skin color satisfaction.

157877,,2021-03-26,"BACKGROUND Because of the overabundance of vaccination information on the internet, in the media, and on social media, providing clear and correct information on immunization is critical for parental decision-making. In 2018, the Japan Pediatric Society created and distributed a Vaccine Information Statement (VIS) to provide appropriate immunization information to caregivers. The objectives of the present study were to evaluate the effect of the VIS on immunization rates, adherence to schedule, and parental understanding of immunization in Japan. METHODS This cross-sectional study was conducted at 18 centers in 2 prefectures in Japan. Caregivers were assigned to an intervention group, which received the VIS and a questionnaire when their child reached the age of 1 month, and a control group, which received only the questionnaire. Using the self-reported questionnaires, we evaluated vaccination rates and schedule adherence at age 2 months, and parental knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs regarding immunization. Three months later, the questionnaires were returned, and the findings were compared between the 2 groups. RESULTS We contacted 422 and 428 persons in the intervention and control groups, respectively, and 111/422 (26.3%) and 119/428 (27.8%) returned the surveys. Vaccination rates and adherence rates for the first dose of 4 recommended vaccines did not differ significantly (P > 0.25); however, there were some positive effects on items related to vaccine knowledge (P = 0.03), perceived benefits (P = 0.02), perceived barriers (P < 0.001), and perceived behavioral control (P = 0.01). CONCLUSION The VIS improved parent comprehension of infant immunization.

158247,,2020-11-01,"Background: Animal-assisted interventions (AAI) are increasingly applied for people with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms albeit its effectiveness is unclear.Objectives: To examine the effectiveness of AAI for treating PTSD symptoms.Method: We searched 11 major electronic databases for studies reporting quantitative data on effects of AAI for children and adults with PTSD symptoms. Of 22'211 records identified, we included 41 studies with 1111 participants in the systematic review comprising eight controlled studies with 469 participants in the meta-analysis. We conducted random-effects meta-analyses with all controlled studies based on standardized mean differences (SMD), and calculated standardized mean change (SMC) as effect sizes for studies with a pre-post one-group design. Two independent researchers assessed the quality of the included studies using the NIH Study Quality Assessment Tools. The primary outcome was PTSD or depression symptom severity measured via a standardized measurement at pre- and post-intervention assessments.Results: There was a small but not statistically significant superiority of AAI over standard PTSD psychotherapy (SMD = -0.26, 95% CI: -0.56 to 0.04) in reducing PTSD symptom severity while AAI was superior to waitlist (SMD = -0.82, 95% CI: -1.56 to 0.08). Getting a service dog was superior to waiting for a service dog (SMD = -0.58, 95% CI: -0.88 to -0.28). AAI led to comparable effects in reducing depression as standard PTSD psychotherapy (SMD = -0.03, CI: -0.88 to 0.83). Pre-post comparisons showed large variation for the reduction in PTSD symptom severity, with SMCs ranging from -0.38 to -1.64, and for depression symptom severity, ranging from 0.01 to -2.76. Getting a service dog lowered PTSD symptoms between -0.43 and -1.10 and depression with medium effect size of -0.74.Conclusions: The results indicate that AAI are efficacious in reducing PTSD symptomatology and depression. Future studies with robust study designs and large samples are needed for valid conclusions.","Hediger, Karin; Wagner, Julia; Künzi, Pascale; Haefeli, Anna; Theis, Felicitas; Grob, Carmina; Pauli, Elena; Gerger, Heike",European journal of psychotraumatology,https://doi.org/10.1080/20008198.2021.1879713; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34377357/,728

158946,,2021-03-01,"OBJECTIVE To determine the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the neurosteroidal anaesthetic, alfaxalone, in horses after a single intravenous (IV) injection of alfaxalone, following premedication with acepromazine, xylazine and guaiphenesin. STUDY DESIGN Prospective experimental study. ANIMALS Ten (five male and five female), adult, healthy, Standardbred horses. METHODS Horses were premedicated with acepromazine (0.03 mg kg(-1) IV). Twenty minutes later they received xylazine (1 mg kg(-1) IV), then after 5 minutes, guaiphenesin (35 mg kg(-1) IV) followed immediately by IV induction of anaesthesia with alfaxalone (1 mg kg(-1) ). Cardiorespiratory variables (pulse rate, respiratory rate, pulse oximetry) and clinical signs of anaesthetic depth were evaluated throughout anaesthesia. Venous blood samples were collected at strategic time points and plasma concentrations of alfaxalone were assayed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS) and analysed by noncompartmental pharmacokinetic analysis. The quality of anaesthetic induction and recovery was scored on a scale of 1-5 (1 very poor, 5 excellent). RESULTS The median (range) induction and recovery scores were 4 (3-5) (good: horse slowly and moderately gently attained recumbency with minimal or no rigidity or paddling) and 4 (1-5) (good: horse stood on first attempt with some knuckling and ataxia) respectively. The monitored cardiopulmonary variables were within the range expected for clinical equine anaesthesia. The mean ± SD durations of anaesthesia from induction to sternal recumbency and from induction to standing were 42.7 ± 8.4 and 47 ± 9.6 minutes, respectively. The mean ± SD plasma elimination half life (t(1/2) ), plasma clearance (Clp) and volume of distribution (V(d) ) for alfaxalone were 33.4 minutes, 37.1 ± 11.1 mL minute(-1) kg(-1) and 1.6 ± 0.4 L kg(-1) , respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Alfaxalone, in a 2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin formulation, provides anaesthesia with a short duration of recumbency that is characterised by a smooth induction and satisfactory recovery in the horse. As in other species, alfaxalone is rapidly cleared from the plasma in the horse.","Goodwin, Wendy A; Keates, Helen L; Pasloske, Kirby; Pearson, Martin; Sauer, Ben; Ranasinghe, Millaganamada Gedara",Veterinary anaesthesia and analgesia,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-2995.2011.00634.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21831048/,728

159973,,2019,"INTRODUCTION Urachal remnants are relatively rare. Generally, urachal remnants are detected in young people, and the removed specimen is small, comprising a good indication for laparoscopic surgery. Laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS) for urachal remnants is considered to be safe and result in an excellent cosmetic outcome. Therefore, we report our single-center experience with LESS for urachal remnants. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed 30 patients with urachal remnants who underwent LESS from January 2011 to December 2017. The patients' characteristics, surgical data, postoperative pain, and cosmetic assessment results were retrospectively collected and analyzed. RESULTS Mean total operative time was 151 min, mean pneumoperitoneal surgery time was 83 min, and mean estimated blood loss was 5.0 mL. All patients were started on an oral diet and began ambulating on postoperative day 1. Mean hospital stay was 5.5 days. LESS was completed successfully in all patients, with no conversion to conventional or open surgery. CONCLUSIONS LESS is a viable option for the surgical treatment of urachal remnants. This technique may result in less pain than conventional techniques. Further accumulation of surgical outcomes (especially regarding safety and cosmesis) is required for LESS to become an established treatment for urachal remnants.","Yanishi, Masaaki; Kinoshita, Hidefumi; Matsuzaki, Tomoaki; Yoshida, Takashi; Ohsugi, Haruyuki; Taniguchi, Hisanori; Sugi, Motohiko; Matsuda, Tadashi",Urologia internationalis,https://doi.org/10.1159/000502043; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31362284/,728

160449,,2020-06-04,"BACKGROUND The 90-day modified Rankin Scale is a widely used outcome after stroke but is sometimes hard to ascertain due to loss to follow-up. Missing outcomes can result in biased and/or inefficient estimates in clinical trials. The aim of this study is to assess the validity of acquiring the 90-day modified Rankin Scale at a later point of time when the patient has been lost at 90 days to impute the missing value. METHODS Participants who had prospectively completed a 90-day modified Rankin Scale questionnaire on their own in the Benefits of Stroke Treatment Using a Mobile Stroke Unit study were randomly interviewed to recall the 90-day modified Rankin Scale at 6, 9, or 12 months after hospital discharge over the phone. Concordance between the two scores was assessed using kappa and weighted kappa statistics. Logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with inconsistent reporting of the 90-day modified Rankin Scale. RESULTS Substantial agreement was observed between in-the-moment and retrospective 90-day modified Rankin Scale recalled at 6, 9, or 12 months (weighted kappa = 0.93, 95% confidence interval: 0.89-0.98; weighted kappa = 0.93, 95% confidence interval: 0.85-1.00 and weighted kappa = 0.89, 95% confidence interval: 0.82-0.95, respectively).

162147,,2021-08-16,"OBJECTIVE Cervical anterior fusion with autologous bone grafts (Williams-Isu method) is a modified, accepted method to treat spinal degenerative disease. Here we report minimum 10-year outcomes. METHODS Of 101 patients we treated by cervical anterior fusion using the Williams-Isu method, 50 patients were followed up for a mean of 177 months. Among the 51 patients lost to long-term follow-up 12 were contacted by telephone; they reported their condition as good and none required reoperation. We evaluated their clinical outcomes on the Japan Orthopedic Association (JOA) score and assessed radiologic findings. RESULTS The average JOA score was 12.5 preoperatively, 15.9 at 2 years after surgery (recovery rate 74.9%), and 15.5 at final follow-up (recovery rate 67.0%). All 5 reoperated patients were treated on the level adjacent to the original lesion. Radiographically, cervical alignment changed from 12.5° to 9.0°, the fused segment angle changed from 5.4° to -0.6°. Although worsening of the fused segment angle did not affect the clinical results, it did affect postoperative cervical sagittal alignment. Cervical alignment and range of motion (ROM) were not different between reoperated (group I) and nonreoperated patients (group II). Fused segment angle worsening was milder than expected in group I. CONCLUSIONS The long-term results after the Williams-Isu method were good. The fused segment angle loss of approximately 6° did not affect long-term outcomes although it did affect sagittal cervical alignment. Postoperative worsening of the fused segment angle and hyper ROM changes in the adjacent level were not related to the need for reoperation in our study.","Kim, Kyongsong; Isu, Toyohiko; Daijiro, Morimoto; Sugawara, Atsushi; Matsumoto, Ryoji; Isobe, Masanori; Kobayashi, Shiro; Teramoto, Akira",World neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wneu.2012.11.072; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23202582/,728

However, traditional manufacturing methods such as powder metallurgy greatly restrict the sample size and part complexity. Here, we report that bulk Cu containing high volume percentages of uniformly distributed CrBx were fabricated by casting via in-situ reduction assisted by aluminum (Al). Two sets of precursors, i.e., borax-CuCr and KBF4-CrF3, were used and the respective reaction mechanisms were illustrated. In addition, the resultant in-situ particle morphologies and sizes from the precursors were studied. The use of KBF4-CrF3 generated smaller in-situ particles due to the less severe coalescence of particles. The microhardness of in-situ Cu/CrBx was significantly enhanced over pure Cu.","Yao, Gongcheng; Yuan, Jie; Pan, Shuaihang; Guan, Zeyi; Cao, Chezheng; Li, Xiaochun",Procedia Manufacturing,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2351978920315055; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351978920315055,728

183255,,2021-05-28,"Introduction: The Coronavirus-19 pandemic has had profound effects on health professions education (HPE) posing serious challenges to the continued provision and implementation of undergraduate, postgraduate and continuing medical education (CME). Across these HPE domains, the major disruptions included the exclusion of undergraduate learners from clinical learning environments, restricted intra-, inter-institutional and overseas movement of medical professionals, termination of face-to-face learner-educator interactions, deployment of postgraduate learners into non-scope service settings, and CME postponement. Methods: In this review we report on how in Singapore various adaptive measures were instituted across the 3 HPE domains at institutional and national level to maintain adequate resources at the frontline to meet service exigencies, promote healthcare professionals' wellbeing and safety as well as mitigate the spread of the pandemic. Results: We identified several strategies and contingencies developed to address these challenges. These involved the use of online learning platforms, distributed and asynchronous learning, an undergraduate Pathway Programme, and use of innovative hands-on technology like simulation. Robust, well pre-planned pandemic preparedness, effective communication, as well as provision of psychological support resources ensured maintenance of service and academic continuity, trust and resilience within HPE. However, several challenges remain, namely the timing and manner of conducting formative and summative assessments, cybersecurity, and the indispensable hands-on, in-person experiential learning for surgical training. Conclusion: Strong leadership with vision and planning, good communication, prioritising learners' and educators' wellbeing and safety, and harnessing existing and emerging online learning technologies are crucial elements for effective contingencies for HPE disruption during pandemics.

613244,,2020-08-03,"BACKGROUND: Critically ill COVID-19 patients have pathophysiological lung features characterized by perfusion abnormalities. However, to date no study has evaluated whether the changes in the distribution of pulmonary gas and blood volume are associated with the severity of gas-exchange impairment and the type of respiratory support (non-invasive versus invasive) in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: This was a single-center, retrospective cohort study conducted in a tertiary care hospital in Northern Italy during the first pandemic wave. Pulmonary gas and blood distribution was assessed using a technique for quantitative analysis of dual-energy computed tomography. Lung aeration loss (reflected by percentage of normally aerated lung tissue) and the extent of gas:blood volume mismatch (percentage of non-aerated, perfused lung tissue—shunt; aerated, non-perfused dead space; and non-aerated/non-perfused regions) were evaluated in critically ill COVID-19 patients with different clinical severity as reflected by the need for non-invasive or invasive respiratory support. RESULTS: Thirty-five patients admitted to the intensive care unit between February 29th and May 30th, 2020 were included. Patients requiring invasive versus non-invasive mechanical ventilation had both a lower percentage of normally aerated lung tissue (median [interquartile range] 33% [24–49%] vs. 63% [44–68%], p < 0.001); and a larger extent of gas:blood volume mismatch (43% [30–49%] vs. 25% [14–28%], p = 0.001), due to higher shunt (23% [15–32%] vs. 5% [2–16%], p = 0.001) and non-aerated/non perfused regions (5% [3–10%] vs. 1% [0–2%], p = 0.001). The PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio correlated positively with normally aerated tissue (ρ = 0.730, p < 0.001) and negatively with the extent of gas-blood volume mismatch (ρ = − 0.633, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In critically ill patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia, the need for invasive mechanical ventilation and oxygenation impairment were associated with loss of aeration and the extent of gas:blood volume mismatch.

622814,,2020-05-21,"Viroporins are small, hydrophobic trans-membrane viral proteins that oligomerize to form hydrophilic pores in the host cell membranes. These proteins are crucial for the pathogenicity and replication of viruses as they aid in various stages of the viral life cycle, from genome uncoating to viral release. In addition, the ion channel activity of viroporin causes disruption in the cellular ion homeostasis, in particular the calcium ion. Fluctuation in the calcium level triggers the activation of the host defensive programmed cell death pathways as well as the inflammasome, which in turn are being subverted for the viruses’ replication benefits. This review article summarizes recent developments in the functional investigation of viroporins from various viruses and their contributions to viral replication and virulence.","Sze, Ching Wooen; Tan, Yee-Joo",Viruses,https://doi.org/10.3390/v7062771; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26110585/,728

However, COVID‐19 and the mitigation strategies to limit its transmission have affected children and adolescents through increased parental morbidity and mortality, increased poverty and financial strain, social isolation, and lost connectedness to school, peers, and afterschool activities. These are all associated with increased risk for psychiatric disorders and STBs in children. Mental health professionals and pediatric primary care settings need to monitor psychiatric symptoms and risk for STBs in children and especially among those who were directly affected during the pandemic in order to reduce the burden of the pandemic on children and families.","Melhem, Nadine M.; Brent, David A.",Child Adolesc Ment Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34190403/; https://doi.org/10.1111/camh.12488,728

The objective of the present study was to estimate and compare the time till viral clearance of SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic and non-critical symptomatic individuals. We studied 184 SARS-CoV-2-positive participants, of whom 145 were asymptomatic. Our analysis uncovered that time till viral negativity is similar for subclinical [median time till viral clearance: 11 days, interquartile range (IQR): 8, 14] and overt infections (median: 11 days, IQR: 9, 14) after controlling for age and sex. This has implications in understanding the period of infectivity for SARS-CoV-2 in order to plan adequate public health measures to control the community spread.","Kumar, Nitya; AbdulRahman, AbdulKarim; AlAli, Salman; Otoom, Sameer; Atkin, Stephen L.; AlQahtani, Manaf",Front Med (Lausanne),https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2021.616927; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33842498/,728
