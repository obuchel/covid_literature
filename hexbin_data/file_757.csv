346508,Severe Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a Patient with Covid-19,2021,"Most countries are currently gravitating towards vaccination as mainstay strategy to quell COVID-19 transmission Between December 2020 and January 2021, we conducted a follow-up online survey in Somalia to monitor adherence to COVID-19 preventive measures, and COVID-19 vaccine acceptability and reasons for vaccine hesitancy Adherence was measured via a composite adherence score based on four measures (physical distancing, face mask use, hand hygiene, and mouth covering when coughing/sneezing) We analyzed 4543 responses (mean age: 23 5 ± 6 4 years, 62 4% males) The mean adherence score during this survey was lower than the score during a similar survey in April 2020 A total of 76 8% of respondents were willing to receive the COVID-19 vaccine Flu-like symptoms were more frequently reported in the current survey compared to previous surveys Multiple logistic regression showed that participants who experienced flu-like symptoms, those in the healthcare sector, and those with higher adherence scores had higher odds for vaccine acceptability while being a female reduced the willingness to be vaccinated In conclusion, our data suggest that the decreasing adherence to COVID-19 preventive measures may have caused increased flu-like symptoms over time COVID-19 vaccine acceptance in Somalia is relatively high but could be improved by addressing factors that contribute to vaccine hesitancy","Ahmed, Mohammed A.
