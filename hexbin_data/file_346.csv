Zoonotic spillover from camels appears to play a major role in transmission. Because of logistic difficulties in working with dromedaries in containment, a more manageable animal model would be desirable. We report shedding and transmission of this virus in experimentally infected alpacas (n = 3) or those infected by contact (n = 3). Infectious virus was detected in all infected animals and in 2 of 3 in-contact animals. All alpacas seroconverted and were rechallenged 70 days after the original infection. Experimentally infected animals were protected against reinfection, and those infected by contact were partially protected. Necropsy specimens from immunologically naive animals (n = 3) obtained on day 5 postinfection showed virus in the upper respiratory tract. These data demonstrate efficient virus replication and animal-to-animal transmission and indicate that alpacas might be useful surrogates for camels in laboratory studies.","Adney, Danielle R.; Bielefeldt-Ohmann, Helle; Hartwig, Airn E.; Bowen, Richard A.",Emerg Infect Dis,346,9

For this purpose, the new Exponential-X Fréchet (NEXF) distribution that belongs to the new exponential-X (NEX) family of distributions is proposed to be a superior fitting model for some reliability models with nonmonotone hazard functions and beat the competitive distribution such as the exponential distribution and Frechet distribution with two and three parameters. So, we concentrated our effort to introduce a new novel model. Throughout this research, we have studied the properties of its statistical measures of the NEXF distribution. The process of parameter estimation has been studied under a complete sample and Type-I censoring scheme. The numerical simulation is detailed to asses the proposed techniques of estimation. Finally, a Type-I censoring real-life application on leukaemia patient's survival with a new treatment has been studied to illustrate the estimation methods, which are well fitted by the NEXF distribution among all its competitors. We used for the fitting test the novel modified Kolmogorov–Smirnov (KS) algorithm for fitting Type-I censored data.","Alzeley, Omar; Almetwally, Ehab M.; Gemeay, Ahmed M.; Alshanbari, Huda M.; Hafez, E.

In screening programmes, participation rates are a major determinant of the success of the programme. Informed uptake, participation, and adherence (to successive screening rounds) determine the overall impact of the intervention by ensuring the maximum number of people at risk of the disease are screened regularly and therefore have the most chance of benefiting. Existing cancer screening programmes have taught us a great deal about methods that improve participation. Although evidence is emerging for the efficacy of some of those methods in lung cancer screening, there is still much work to do in the specific demographic that is most at risk of lung cancer. This demographic, characterised by higher levels of socioeconomic deprivation, may be less willing to engage with healthcare interventions and present a particular challenge in the process of ensuring informed choice. In this article we review the evidence for improving participation and describe the challenges that need to be addressed to ensure the successful implementation of CT screening programmes.","Baldwin, David R; Brain, Kate; Quaife, Samantha",Translational lung cancer research,346,1

The cornerstones of management include prompt identification of sepsis, early initiation of antibiotic therapy, adequate fluid resuscitation and organ support. Over the past two decades, there have been considerable improvements in our understanding of the pathophysiology of sepsis and the host response, including regulation of inflammation, endothelial disruption and impaired immunity. This has offered opportunities for innovative adjunctive treatments such as vitamin C, corticosteroids and beta-blockers. Some of these approaches have shown promising results in early phase trials in humans, while others, such as corticosteroids, have been tested in large, international, multicentre randomised controlled trials. Contemporary guidelines make a weak recommendation for the use of corticosteroids to reduce mortality in sepsis and septic shock. Vitamin C, despite showing initial promise in observational studies, has so far not been shown to be clinically effective in randomised trials. Beta-blocker therapy may have beneficial cardiac and non-cardiac effects in septic shock, but there is currently insufficient evidence to recommend their use for this condition. The results of ongoing randomised trials are awaited. Crucial to reducing heterogeneity in the trials of new sepsis treatments will be the concept of enrichment, which refers to the purposive selection of patients with clinical and biological characteristics that are likely to be responsive to the intervention being tested.","Donovan, K; Shah, A; Day, J; McKechnie, S R",Anaesthesia,346,28

METHODS We implemented audio-only prenatal virtual visits in response to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic within a large, county-based prenatal care system serving predominantly women with low socioeconomic status and limited resources. Using a four-question telephone survey, we surveyed a cross-section of patients who had opted to participate in virtual visits to assess their level of satisfaction surrounding audio-only visits. In addition, average clinic wait times and attendance rates by visit type were examined. RESULTS From March 17 to May 31, 2020, more than 4,000 audio-only virtual prenatal visits were completed in our system. After implementation, the percentage of visits conducted through the virtual platform gradually rose, with nearly 25% of weekly prenatal visits being performed through the virtual platform by the month of May. Clinic wait times trended downward after implementation of virtual visits (P<.001). On average, 88% of virtual prenatal visits were completed as scheduled, whereas only 82% of in-person visits were attended (P<.001). Hospital administration attempted to contact 431 patients who had participated in at least one virtual visit to assess patient satisfaction; 283 patients were reached and agreed to participate (65%). Ninety-nine percent of respondents reported that their needs were met during their audio-only virtual visits. The majority of patients preferred a combination of in-person and virtual visits for prenatal care, and patients reported many benefits with virtual visits. CONCLUSION Audio-only virtual prenatal visits-as a complement to in-person prenatal visits-have specific and distinct advantages compared with video-enabled telehealth in a vulnerable population of women and offer a viable option to increase access to care.","Holcomb, Denisse; Faucher, Mary Ann; Bouzid, Jennifer; Quint-Bouzid, Marjorie; Nelson, David B; Duryea, Elaine",Obstetrics and gynecology,346,33

The aim of this systematic review was to critically appraise the evidence comparing CRP serum levels (standard and high-sensitivity [hs]) of otherwise healthy patients suffering from periodontitis when compared to controls. The impact of intensive and non-intensive nonsurgical periodontal treatment (NSPT) on hs-CRP was also investigated. Four electronic databases (Pubmed, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials [CENTRAL], EMBASE and Web of Science) were searched up to February 2021 and the review was completed according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines (PROSPERO No. CRD42020167454). Observational and intervention studies that: 1) evaluated CRP and hs-CRP serum levels in patients with and without periodontitis, and; 2) hs- CRP levels after NSPT were included. Following risk of bias appraisal, both qualitative and quantitative analyses were performed. Pooled estimates were rendered through ratio of means (RoM) random-effects meta-analyses. After screening 485 studies, 77 case-control studies and 67 intervention trials were included. Chronic and aggressive periodontitis diagnoses were consistently associated with higher levels of CRP and hs-CRP (p<0.001). Patients with aggressive periodontitis exhibited on average more than 50% higher levels of CRP (RoM [95% confidence interval [CI]]: 1.56 [1.15; 2.12], p=0.0039) than patients with chronic periodontitis. Intensive NSPT induced an immediate increase of hs-CRP followed by a progressive decrease whilst non-intensive NSPT consistently decreased hs-CRP after treatment up to 180 days (p<0.001). These findings provide robust evidence that periodontitis is associated with systemic inflammation as measured by serum CRP levels. Periodontitis treatment induces a short-term acute inflammatory increase when performed in an intensive session, whilst a progressive reduction up to 6 months was demonstrated when performed in multiple visits.","Machado, Vanessa; Botelho, João; Escalda, Cláudia; Hussain, Syed Basit; Luthra, Shailly; Mascarenhas, Paulo; Orlandi, Marco; Mendes, José João; D'Aiuto, Francesco",Frontiers in immunology,346,13

Pregnant women who adopt, practice and maintain healthy behaviours can potentially improve the health of themselves and their babies. Mobile applications are an increasingly popular mode of accessing, storing and sharing health information among pregnant women. The main objective of this review is to evaluate the effects of mobile application interventions during pregnancy on maternal behaviour and associated maternal and infant outcomes. METHODS This review will include randomised and non-randomised studies which tested use of mobile applications designed to improve either maternal knowledge or behaviours to address known risk factors associated with adverse perinatal health outcomes. This review will include studies which included pregnant women and/or women during birth. The search strategy will utilise a combination of keywords and MeSH terms. Literature databases such as PubMed, Embase, The Cochrane Library, CINAHL and WHO Global Health Library will be searched. Two reviewers will independently screen retrieved citations to determine if they meet inclusion criteria. Studies will be selected that provide information about interventions commenced in early pregnancy, late pregnancy or labour. Comparisons to be made include mobile applications versus interventions relying on paper-based or text-messaging-based communication; interpersonal communication such as face-to-face or telephone conversation; and no intervention or standard care. Quality assessment of included randomised studies will utilise established guidelines provided in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. Quality assessment of non-randomised studies will be based on the Risk of Bias in Non-randomised Studies-of Interventions (ROBINS-I) assessment tool. Quality of the evidence will be evaluated using the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Separate comparisons and analyses for primary and secondary outcomes will be performed. Results of the review will be reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. DISCUSSION This systematic review will identify and synthesize evidence about the effect of interventions delivered through mobile applications on influencing maternal behaviour and improving perinatal health outcomes.

Based on the sequence of the S gene and the results of cross-neutralisation tests, D181 can be considered as a new serotype and the second lineage within genotype II (GII-2). The experimental infection of SPF hens confirmed the ability of D181 to cause a drop in egg production and immunohistochemistry showed presence of the virus in the trachea, lung and conjunctiva at 5 days post inoculation and in the caecal tonsils at 5 and 8 days post inoculation. In silico analysis of several widely used PCR primers indicated that primer sets adapted for GII might be needed to detect D181, as many general S1 primers might miss it.","Molenaar, R J; Dijkman, R; de Wit, J J",Avian pathology : journal of the W.V.P.A,346,1

To establish the potential of social network theory-based metrics in better understanding public health campaigns, we analyzed real-time user interactions on Twitter during the 2020 World Breastfeeding Week (WBW) as an exemplar case. Social network analysis (SNA), including community and influencer identification, as well as topic modeling were used to compare the activity of n = 29,958 campaign participants and n = 10,694 reference users from the six-months pre-campaign period. Users formed more inter-connected relationships during the campaign, retweeting and mentioning each other 46,161 times compared to 10,662 times in the prior six months. Campaign participants formed identifiable communities that were not only based on their geolocation, but also based on interests and professional background. While influencers who dominated the WBW conversations were disproportionally members of the scientific community, the campaign did mobilize influencers from the general public who seemed to play a ""bridging"" role between the public and the scientific community. Users communicated about the campaign beyond its original themes to also discuss breastfeeding within the context of social and racial inequities. Applying SNA allowed understanding of the breastfeeding campaign's messaging and engagement dynamics across communities and influencers. Moving forward, WBW could benefit from improving targeting to enhance geographic coverage and user interactions. As this exemplar case indicates, social network theory and analysis can be used to inform other public health campaigns with data on user interactions that go beyond traditional metrics.","Moukarzel, Sara; Rehm, Martin; Caduff, Anita; Del Fresno, Miguel; Perez-Escamilla, Rafael; Daly, Alan J",PloS one,346,17

However, there have been no direct comparisons of AKI in hospitalized patients with and without COVID-19 that would reveal whether there are aspects of AKI risk, course, and outcomes unique to this infection. METHODS In a retrospective observational study, we evaluated AKI incidence, risk factors, and outcomes for 3345 adults with COVID-19 and 1265 without COVID-19 who were hospitalized in a large New York City health system and compared them with a historical cohort of 9859 individuals hospitalized a year earlier in the same health system. We also developed a model to identify predictors of stage 2 or 3 AKI in our COVID-19. RESULTS We found higher AKI incidence among patients with COVID-19 compared with the historical cohort (56.9% versus 25.1%, respectively). Patients with AKI and COVID-19 were more likely than those without COVID-19 to require RRT and were less likely to recover kidney function. Development of AKI was significantly associated with male sex, Black race, and older age (>50 years). Male sex and age >50 years associated with the composite outcome of RRT or mortality, regardless of COVID-19 status. Factors that were predictive of stage 2 or 3 AKI included initial respiratory rate, white blood cell count, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, and lactate dehydrogenase level. CONCLUSIONS Patients hospitalized with COVID-19 had a higher incidence of severe AKI compared with controls. Vital signs at admission and laboratory data may be useful for risk stratification to predict severe AKI. Although male sex, Black race, and older age associated with development of AKI, these associations were not unique to COVID-19.","Fisher, Molly; Neugarten, Joel; Bellin, Eran; Yunes, Milagros; Stahl, Lindsay; Johns, Tanya S; Abramowitz, Matthew K; Levy, Rebecca; Kumar, Neelja; Mokrzycki, Michele H; Coco, Maria; Dominguez, Mary; Prudhvi, Kalyan; Golestaneh, Ladan",Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN,346,1

From this experience of serving community geospatial data needs for risk communication, particularly in marginalized areas, and through working with the World Health Organization Collaborating Center for Remote Sensing and GIS for Public Health (WHOCC), we identified several useful geospatial technologies (GT) and methods for their implementation in risk communication strategies. OBJECTIVES This article provides an assessment of the benefits and limitations of these technologies for risk communication in marginalized communities. METHODS Several GT have been employed for risk communication and general data dissemination in communities throughout rural coastal Louisiana. From experimentation with these technologies for risk communication, they can be classed into three groups: lightweight GIS, map dissemination tools, and interactive GT. RESULTS Lightweight GIS and map dissemination tools will, at some point in their application, require the assistance of a GIS expert or GIS data provider to develop and customize the tool for its intended uses. Interactive GT, however, has rapidly developed options that allow user-friendly operation without reliance on expert assistance. Google Maps, however, is showing the greatest potential for community-based health participation.

However, there has been a relative lack of research comparing COVID-19 outbreaks and responses between Muslim-majority countries. Aims This study aimed to analyse COVID-19 burden, epidemiology and mitigation strategies in Muslim-majority countries. Methods We use a mixed-methods approach to describe the course of the COVID-19 pandemic throughout the Islamic world, highlight the range of non-pharmaceutical interventions used and the speed with which they were implemented, and investigate reasons behind the differing responses between Muslim-majority countries. The number of cases and deaths per million population, and the mean time taken to implement a range of policies, were compared across the Islamic world. Cases per million population and the mean estimated doubling time for cases was compared between Muslim- majority countries on the basis of governance systems, rapidity of institution of mitigation strategies and conflict groups. We also evaluated pushback to implementation of measures within MMCs, especially from religious quarters. Results Non-democratic regimes had much shorter doubling time of cases compared to functional democratic Muslim- majority countries (mean 33.9 versus 66.5 days, P = 0.002) and a significantly greater proportion of countries appeared to have flattened the curve by 1 June 2020 (43.8% versus 12.5%, P < 0.03). The doubling time was also significantly greater among countries who implemented lockdown and mitigation measures early (66.7 versus 16.7 days, P < 0.003). Conclusion Our analysis indicates wide diversity in the COVID-19 response across Muslim majority countries with clear indication that functional democracies were able to contain the epidemic significantly better than nondemocratic regimes.

A potential use of MFT as a new diagnostic tool for detecting endolymphatic hydrops has recently been reported. However, its clinical usefulness for diagnosing Ménière's disease (MD) remains unclear. To evaluate the clinical usefulness of MFT as a new qualitative and diagnostic test for MD, we performed MFT in 70 patients with unilateral or bilateral MD and in 29 normal control subjects. The width of double peaks in the admittance tympanograms (Y width) at 2 kHz and the resonance frequency (RF) were analyzed, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed. The Y width in MD-affected ears was significantly greater than that in control ears (p < 0.001). The RF in MD-affected ears was significantly lower than that in control ears (p < 0.01). Neither the Y width nor RF had a significant relationship with hearing levels or the results of caloric and vestibular myogenic potential testings. The area under the ROC curve was 0.71 for the Y width and 0.66 for the RF. At the optimal cutoff points, the sensitivity and specificity of the Y width were 47.3 and 86.8%, respectively, and those of the RF were 41.3 and 84.2%, respectively. These results indicated that MFT is significantly associated with the presence of MD, but its diagnostic accuracy is only modest. MFT is a simple, noninvasive test, which should be considered as a complementary test in the diagnosis of MD.","Sugasawa, Keiko; Iwasaki, Shinichi; Fujimoto, Chisato; Kinoshita, Makoto; Inoue, Aki; Egami, Naoya; Ushio, Munetaka; Chihara, Yasuhiro; Yamasoba, Tatsuya",Audiology & neuro-otology,346,1

We assessed the relationship between lateral displacement, disturbances to cerebral autoregulation, and clinical outcomes in acutely comatose patients. DESIGN Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data. SETTING Neurocritical care unit of the Johns Hopkins Hospital. PATIENTS Acutely comatose patients (Glasgow Coma Score ≤ 8). INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Cerebral oximetry index, derived from near-infrared spectroscopy multimodal monitoring, was used to evaluate cerebral autoregulation. Associations between lateral brain displacement, global cerebral autoregulation, and interhemispheric cerebral autoregulation asymmetry were assessed using mixed random effects models with random intercept. Patients were grouped by functional outcome, determined by the modified Rankin Scale. Associations between outcome group, lateral displacement, and cerebral oximetry index were assessed using multivariate linear regression. Increasing lateral brain displacement was associated with worsening global cerebral autoregulation (p = 0.01 septum; p = 0.05 pineal) and cerebral autoregulation asymmetry (both p < 0.001). Maximum lateral displacement during the first 3 days of coma was significantly different between functional outcome groups at hospital discharge (p = 0.019 pineal; p = 0.008 septum), 3 months (p = 0.026; p = 0.007), 6 months (p = 0.018; p = 0.010), and 12 months (p = 0.022; p = 0.012). Global cerebral oximetry index was associated with functional outcomes at 3 months (p = 0.019) and 6 months (p = 0.013). CONCLUSIONS During the first 3 days of acute coma, increasing lateral brain displacement is associated with worsening global cerebral autoregulation and cerebral autoregulation asymmetry, and poor long-term clinical outcomes in acutely comatose patients. The impact of acute interventions on outcome needs to be explored.","Adatia, Krishma; Geocadin, Romergryko G; Healy, Ryan; Ziai, Wendy; Ponce-Mejia, Luciano; Anderson-White, Mirinda; Shah, Dhaval; Radzik, Batya R; Palmisano, Caitlin; Hogue, Charles W; Brown, Charles; Suarez, Jose I; Rivera-Lara, Lucia",Critical care medicine,346,1

DESIGN Prospective, nonrandomized. SETTING Climb from 2370 to 3350 m. PARTICIPANTS Young adults (aged 18 to 26 years) (N = 91) chose to participate in either the fast ascent (3 days; n = 43) or slow ascent (4 days; n = 48) group (1 and 2). ASSESSMENT OF RISK FACTORS Two criteria were used to define AMS. A Lake Louise score ≥3 and Lake Louise criteria [in the setting of a recent gain in altitude, the presence of headache and at least 1 of gastrointestinal discomfort (anorexia, nausea, or vomiting), fatigue or weakness, dizziness or lightheadedness, or difficulty sleeping]. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Heart rate, blood oxygen saturation (SaO2), and symptoms of AMS were monitored each morning and evening. RESULTS Baseline characteristics were similar between groups, except for significant differences in history of alcohol consumption (P = 0.009) and climbing experience above 3000 m (P < 0.001). The incidence of AMS was not associated with the rate of ascent. Acute mountain sickness was most prevalent in group 1 on day 2 in the evening and in group 2 on day 3 in the evening. In both groups, AMS correlated with the initial reduction in SaO2. Body mass index (BMI) >24 kg/m was identified as a significant risk factor for AMS. CONCLUSIONS The development of AMS was closely associated with an initial reduction in SaO2. A BMI >24 kg/m also contributed to the occurrence of AMS. CLINICAL RELEVANCE These findings indicate that factors other than ascent rate should be considered when trying to ameliorate the risk of AMS.","Hsu, Tai-Yi; Weng, Yi-Ming; Chiu, Yu-Hui; Li, Wen-Cheng; Chen, Pang-Yen; Wang, Shih-Hao; Huang, Kuo-Feng; Kao, Wei-Fong; Chiu, Te-Fa; Chen, Jih-Chang",Clinical journal of sport medicine : official journal of the Canadian Academy of Sport Medicine,346,7

METHODS Retrospective analysis of demand and occupancy data provided by ACEM accredited EDs in voluntary surveys at the start of June and September 2017-2020. Hospitals answering all surveys were grouped and compared by jurisdiction and role delineation. RESULTS 121 EDs were eligible, 63% supplied complete occupancy data and 53% complete demand data. Between the June 2017 and 2019 surveys, mean daily ED presentations increased 11.4% (P=0.0003). The number being treated at 10:00 rose by 27.7% (P<0.0001) and those experiencing access block (waiting for an inpatient bed, been in ED more than 8 hours) rose by 46.1% (P=0.001). Between the June 2019 and 2020 surveys, ED presentations fell by an average of 12.6% (P<0.0001), ward admissions were almost unchanged (-6.0%, P=NS), and patients who did not wait to be seen fell by 57.8% (P<0.0001). Major paediatric hospitals reported a 28% decrease in presentations. By September 2020, only the State of Victoria (ongoing state of emergency) and major paediatric hospitals reported demand lower than 2019 or occupancy lower than 2018. CONCLUSIONS Occupancy increased by more than demand 2017-2019, with some decrease in 2020: in June presentations were 12.7% lower than 2019, in September back to the normal range outside Victorian and major paediatric hospitals.

Lung transplantation has achieved rapid development in the world. At present, about 4 000 cases are carried out every year, and the long-term survival rate has gradually improved. With a high incidence of lung disease in China, at least ten thousand patients with respiratory failure need lung transplantation every year. In 2020, 29 lung transplantation centers in China has carried out more than 500 cases of lung transplantation. Idiopathic pulmonary interstitial fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, secondary pulmonary interstitial fibrosis and pneumoconiosis were the main primary diseases in lung transplantation recipients in China. Single-lung transplantation accounted for 57.6% and double-lung transplantation accounted for 42.4%, respectively. Peri-operation (&lt;30 days), one-year, and three-year survival rates were 78.5%, 64.5% and 48.9%, respectively for double-lung transplant. The corresponding survival rates for single-lung transplant recipients were 83.0%, 69.9% and 46.8%, respectively. The Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University completed the first case of COVID-19 lung transplantation operation in Hubei Province in 2020, and the patients recovered and discharged successfully after the operation. Although China has made great progress in lung transplantation, it is still necessary to realize that the multi-disciplinary team cooperation mode and data registration management still need to be further strengthened, in order to provide more clinical guidelines and expert consensus and make the steady development and improvement of each lung transplantation center.

Previous studies have shown promising relationships between perceived susceptibility to COVID-19, mindfulness-related variables, and COVID-19 health protective behaviors (social distancing and PPE use). In this longitudinal study, the variables were measured across a two-month interval during the earlier phase of the pandemic in June (Time 1) and August (Time 2), 2020. The results from 151 matched USA MTurk participants indicated that the perceived susceptibility to COVID-19 did not significantly predict the health protective behaviors. For mindfulness, nonreactivity was positively related to PPE use while nonjudgement was negatively related to PPE use. Accordingly, mindfulness promotion messages could be a way to increase the likelihood of people performing health protective behaviors to better constrain the COVID-19 outbreak.","OBrien, W.

METHODS Male Wistar rats were injected subcutaneously with eplerenone (100 mg/kg body weight) or vehicle. Two hours following the injections, a half of the animals from each treatment group were decapitated to obtain blood for measurement of hormone levels. The other half of the animals was subjected to behavioural testing in the elevated plus-maze test. To provide comprehensive behavioural profile of eplerenone, standard spatiotemporal and ethologically derived measures of anxiety were assessed. RESULTS Single treatment with eplerenone resulted in a significant increase in plasma aldosterone levels. Plasma concentrations of ACTH and corticosterone were not modified by eplerenone injection. Administration of eplerenone failed to alter classical spatiotemporal measures of anxiety (number of entries and time spent in the open arms). However, ethological parameters related to exploration (head dipping) and risk assessment behaviour (stretched attend postures) were significantly affected by eplerenone injection. CONCLUSIONS Single injection of eplerenone is followed by a reduction of ethological indices of anxiety-like behaviour and by an elevation of plasma aldosterone levels. Acute administration of eplerenone appears to affect the RAA system but not hormones of the HPA axis.","Hlavacova, Natasa; Jezova, Daniela",Endocrine regulations,346,11

The result has been increased pressure on frontline health workers. As the pandemic unfolds, the impact on health systems in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) is becoming apparent. In lower resource settings, the detrimental effects on frontline health workers will likely be significant due to fragmented infrastructure, low compensation, and significant shortages of necessary resources such as personal protective equipment. These high stress conditions, coupled with risk of infection and fears and anxieties among patients, can result in grave psychosocial consequences for frontline health workers, who play a vital role in delivering the bulk of primary care services in LMICs. In this narrative review, we consider the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on frontline health workers in LMICs. We describe the important role of frontline health workers, summarize existing literature on burnout and risks to mental health in this essential workforce, and consider how public health emergencies exacerbate these concerns to showcase their vulnerability to mental health impacts of COVID-19. We explore emerging research on the detrimental effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on health workers and consider possible approaches to mitigate these consequences.

Neutrophils are first responders to external threats, and they use different mechanisms to control pathogens. Phagocytosis, reactive oxygen species, and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are some of the mechanisms that neutrophils utilize to fight pathogens. Although there is some controversy as to whether NETs are in fact beneficial or detrimental to the host, it mainly depends on the biological context. NETs can contribute to disease pathogenesis in certain types of diseases, while they are also undeniably critical components of the innate immune response. On the contrary, the role of eosinophils during host immune responses remains to be better elucidated. Eosinophils play an important role during helminthic infections and allergic responses. Eosinophils can function as effector cells in viral respiratory infections, gut bacterial infections, and as modulators of immune responses by driving the balance between Th1 and Th2 responses. In particular, eosinophils have biological activities that appear to be quite similar to those of neutrophils. Both possess bactericidal activity, can activate proinflammatory responses, can modulate adaptive immune responses, can form extracellular traps, and can be beneficial or detrimental to the host according to the underlying pathology. In this review we compare these two cell types with a focus on highlighting their numerous similarities related to extracellular traps.","Williams, Tyler L; Rada, Balázs; Tandon, Eshaan; Gestal, Monica C",,346,17

FindingsIn individuals with prior infection, all vaccines were associated with higher antibody concentrations and neutralization than those in convalescent individuals, even after a single dose. In individuals without prior infection, a single dose of either mRNA vaccine yielded comparable concentrations and neutralization to convalescent unvaccinated individuals, and Ad26.COV2.S yielded lower antibody concentrations and neutralization titers. The second dose of either mRNA vaccine boosted responses. At a median of 24 days after vaccination, two of 21 (9.5%) Ad26.COV2.S recipients had a neutralization titer higher than pre-pandemic controls; repeat sampling at a median 66 days after vaccination found most (11/15 (73%) remained negative.

However, the current detection technologies are far from ideal. A lack of timely and accessible testing for identifying cases and close contacts has allowed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative virus of the ongoing coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, to spread uncontrollably. The slow and expensive detection of mutations-predictors for chronic diseases such as cancer-form a barrier to personalized treatment. A recently developed diagnostic assay is ideal and field-ready-it relies on CRISPR-Cas13. CRISPR-Cas13 works similarly to other CRISPR systems: Cas13 is guided by a crRNA to cleave next to a specific RNA target sequence. Additionally, Cas13 boasts a unique collateral cleavage activity; collateral cleavage of a fluorescent reporter detects the presence of the target sequence in sample RNA. This system forms the basis of CRISPR-Cas13 diagnostic assays. CRISPR-Cas13 assays have >95% sensitivity and >99% specificity. Detection is rapid (<2 h), inexpensive ($0.05 per test), and portable-a test using lateral flow strips is akin to a pregnancy test.

People who use drugs, in particular opioid users, have increased vulnerability. Targeted adaptations of opioid agonist treatment (OAT) are required to protect this vulnerable population and the healthcare workers providing services. In this article we describe and discuss the associated evidence for the measures implemented to reduce the risks associated with COVID-19 to Irish OAT services. Irish OAT services have implemented the following measures: reduced supervision requirements, increased the use of virtual patient care, streamlined assessment and induction processes to remove barriers to OAT access, provided home delivery of medi-cations, increased access to naloxone and overdose programmes, targeted health and social interventions for the homeless and reduced our prison population. For now, non-essential services including drug and blood-borne virus screening and hepatitis C treatment have been postponed. Planning and review of Irish OAT services is ongoing so that further adaptations can be implemented as challenges emerge. Rapid adaptation of OAT services is required to reduce the impact of COVID-19 on patients, staff and the general public. Ongoing evaluation of these measures is critical since many of these changes may have an enormous impact on health and social care outcomes and be cost saving in a post-COVID future. Furthermore, these positive changes may address some of the social and health inequalities experienced by so many.","Crowley, D.; Cullen, W.",Heroin Addiction and Related Clinical Problems,346,9

METHODS: Applying negative binomial regression to a dataset of U.S. counties (N = 3,042), we estimated the relationship between older population ratios and the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases, and how this relationship changes over time in urban and rural counties, respectively. RESULTS: Although low-ratio counties show the highest number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 at the beginning of the pandemic, confirmed cases in high-ratio counties (more than 25% of the total population is 65 and older) increase exponentially with time in urban areas. High-ratio rural counties hit their peak later and recover more slowly compared to low- and medium-ratio rural counties. DISCUSSION: Both urban and rural counties with larger older populations are more vulnerable and their disadvantages in COVID-19 infections are more rapidly exacerbated over time in urban areas. This underscores the importance of early action in those counties for effective intervention and prevention.","Choi, Seung-Won Emily; Yang, Tse-Chuan",,346,22

Thousands of health workers have been infected and outbreaks have occurred in hospitals, aged care facilities and prisons. World Health Organization (WHO) has issued guidelines for contact and droplet precautions for Healthcare Workers (HCWs) caring for suspected COVID-19 patients, whilst the US Centre for Disease Control (CDC) has recommended airborne precautions. The 1 - 2 m (&#8776;3 - 6 ft) rule of spatial separation is central to droplet precautions and assumes large droplets do not travel further than 2 m (&#8776;6 ft). We aimed to review the evidence for horizontal distance travelled by droplets and the guidelines issued by the World Health Organization (WHO), US Center for Diseases Control (CDC) and European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) on respiratory protection for COVID-19. We found that the evidence base for current guidelines is sparse, and the available data do not support the 1 - 2 m (&#8776;3 - 6 ft) rule of spatial separation. Of ten studies on horizontal droplet distance, eight showed droplets travel more than 2 m (&#8776;6 ft), in some cases more than 8 meters (&#8776;26 ft). Several studies of SARS-CoV-2 support aerosol transmission and one study documented virus at a distance of 4 meters (&#8776;13 ft) from the patient. Moreover, evidence suggests infections cannot neatly be separated into the dichotomy of droplet versus airborne transmission routes. Available studies also show that SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in the air, 3 hours after aeroslisation. The weight of combined evidence supports airborne precautions for the occupational health and safety of health workers treating patients with COVID-19.","Bahl, Prateek; Doolan, Con; de Silva, Charitha; Chughtai, Abrar Ahmad; Bourouiba, Lydia; MacIntyre, C Raina",J. infect. dis,346,16

COVID-19 has the potential to lead to severe hypoxia; this is usually the cause of death if it occurs. In a substantial number of patients, adequate arterial oxygenation cannot be achieved with supplementary oxygen therapy alone. To date, there has been no clear guideline endorsement of ward-based non-invasive pressure support (NIPS) for severely hypoxic patients who are deemed unlikely to benefit from invasive ventilation. We established a ward-based NIPS service for COVID-19 PCR-positive patients, with severe hypoxia, and in whom escalation to critical care for invasive ventilation was not deemed appropriate. A retrospective analysis of survival in these patients was undertaken. Twenty-eight patients were included. Ward-based NIPS for severe hypoxia was associated with a 50% survival in this cohort. This compares favourably with Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre survival data following invasive ventilation in a less frail, less comorbid and younger population. These results suggest that ward-based NIPS should be considered as a treatment option in an integrated escalation strategy in all units managing respiratory failure secondary to COVID-19.","Burns, Graham P; Lane, Nicholas D; Tedd, Hilary M; Deutsch, Elizabeth; Douglas, Florence; West, Sophie D; Macfarlane, Jim G; Wiscombe, Sarah; Funston, Wendy",,346,23

Emergence of avoidance conditioning in rat pups is triggered by elevated plasma corticosterone activating the amygdala. Further, the mother's ability to buffer the corticosterone response delays the onset of avoidance in Ë2-week-old pups. Eyeblink conditioning (EBC) also develops during the pre-weaning period. In previous work, little or no conditioning was observed on Day 17 for pups housed in the home cage with mother and littermates between training sessions, whereas pups isolated between training sessions did show some conditioning. This suggests that social buffering may also delay the onset of this form of aversive learning. In the present study with Day-17 pups, one session of periorbital shock, the typical EBC unconditioned stimulus for young rat pups, resulted in lower plasma corticosterone levels and neural activity in the central nucleus of the amygdale (CeA) of pups returned to the mother and homecage following the session as compared to pups isolated following the shock session. These findings demonstrate social buffering of the physiological response to aversive stimulus exposure under conditions of EBC and support the hypothesis that social buffering of early adverse experience may adjust the timing of emergence of EBC in rat pups.

Especially in schools, the duration of stay is long and the number of people in the rooms is large, increasing the risk of infection. This problem particularly affects schools without pre-installed ventilation systems that are equipped with filters and/or operate with fresh air. Here, the aerosol concentration is reduced by natural ventilation. In this context, we are investigating the effect of large mobile air purifiers (AP) with HEPA filters on particle concentration and their suitability for classroom use in a primary school in Germany. The three tested APs differ significantly in their air outlet characteristics. Measurements of the number of particles, the particle size distribution, and the CO2 concentration were carried out in the classroom with students (April/May 2021) and with an aerosol generator without students. In this regard, the use of APs leads to a substantial reduction in aerosol particles. At the same time, the three APs are found to have differences in their particle decay rate, noise level, and flow velocity. In addition to the measurements, the effect of various influencing parameters on the potential inhaled particle dose was investigated using a calculation model. The parameters considered include the duration of stay, particle concentration in exhaled air, respiratory flow rate, virus lifetime, ventilation interval, ventilation efficiency, AP volumetric flow, as well as room size. Based on the resulting effect diagrams, significant recommendations can be derived for reducing the risk of infection from virus-laden aerosols. Finally, the measurements were compared to computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling, as such tools can aid the optimal placement and configuration of APs and can be used to study the effect of the spread of aerosols from a source in the classroom.","Duill, Finn F.; Schulz, Florian; Jain, Aman; Krieger, Leve; Wachem, Berend van; Beyrau, Frank",,346,23

Disconnection notices were served to 2.5% of commercial and industrial accounts, and 3.4% of residential accounts each month in late 2020. About 20% of all accounts were charged late fees. The odds for each of these measures were multiples higher in minority zip codes.","Cicala, Steve",Journal of Public Economics,346,24

Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was then derived from OLI-images, where the total area covered with water, bare soil, scattered vegetation, dense grasses and shrubs, and dense forests were estimated. Across the study period, 2019 had the highest rainfall (195 mm) and temperature (21.7 °C), while the lowest rainfall was recorded in 2018 (154 mm). The Northern Badia showed a consistently larger area of dense vegetation on average (407.4 km2) compared to the Eastern (149.3km2), and Middle (55.2 km2) Badia. The total area covered with scattered vegetation in 2020 was higher than in 2019 and 2018 across the years and studied area, except in Middle Badia. Vegetation cover classes were inconsistent for Middle Badia in March, scattered vegetation was higher in 2019 compared to 2020. However, the total area covered with vegetation in July was lower than in March across the years and studied area. The curfew allowed the regeneration of shrubs and grasses in the study area, which helped in restoring the rangeland vegetation. COVID-19 lockdown served as a conservation grazing technique and provided a real case of restoring the degraded rangeland cover through managed grazing.

In response, we created and implemented a series of flipped classroom exercises consisting of pre-recorded lectures supplemented with novel and live but remote virtual team-based exercises related to cytology and the histology of the basic tissues. These problem-solving exercises demonstrated the practical application of histology and clinical relevance of the basic tissues to medicine while simultaneously preparing our students for their study of microscopic anatomy and organ pathology in subsequent systems-based modules. Here, we outline a method for teaching histology in a team-based virtual learning environment that may serve as a useful model for histological teaching at other institutions. Materials and Methods Overall, six histology topics were integrated into a medical gross anatomy course and were timed to complement the regional anatomy: Back the six quizzes contributed 10% to the overall final grade in gross anatomy. Histology questions were also incorporated into the three theory and practical examinations. The students were engaged remotely in problem solving sessions by using an on-line active learning platform (TopHat.com) broadcasted through video conferencing (Zoom Video Communications). The problems were modeled after USMLE step 1 questions. The students submitted two responses for each question: (1) an independent response when the question was initially presented;and (2) a group response after discussion with a learning team of approximately six students (Breakout Room). The histology questions included multiple choice and ?Tap-On-Target?-type questions using screen shots of histological slides. Results With the exception of cytology and hematology, the basic tissues were easily integrated to complement the gross anatomy presented the course. The students freely discussed solutions to problems in small groups and readily shared their answers with the class. The inclusion of scores from the quizzes in final grading of the gross anatomy course accentuated the importance of histology, kept students on task and encouraged integration between disciplines and cooperative learning. Positioning the quiz at the end of the active learning sessions gave students an opportunity to solidify and clarify concepts with the histology faculty. Conclusion The flipped classroom approach to histology in a remote learning environment promoted participation, contextualized the value of histology and its clinical relevance to the practice of medicine. Future plans include to formally survey and evaluate medical student perceptions of the flipped classroom histology exercises.","Moore, Colin Cotter John",The FASEB Journal,346,18

In the current report, we present one of the first descriptions of an association of GBS and SARS-CoV-2 infection in a child. In our facility, an 11-year-old boy presented with typical features of GBS and, after 5 days, a morbilliform skin rash over the palms of both hands. Three weeks before the start of the neurological symptoms, the boy had experienced an episode of mild febrile illness with mild respiratory manifestations and a persistent cough. The diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed by oropharyngeal swab on reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction assay. The disease course of our patient strongly suggests a possible relationship between the development of GBS and SARS-CoV-2 infection.

However, the convenience of driving alone, especially under the current COVID-19 pandemic, the increase of car ownership and the difficulties in finding travelers with matching schedule and route keeps car occupancy low. The technology is a key enabler of online platforms which facilitate the ride matching process and lead the increase of carpooling services. The aim of this work-in-progress article is to clarify the value proposition of carpooling platforms in smart cities, especially under conditions like the pandemic. Thus, an extensive bibliometric analysis of three separate specialized literature collections using the bibliometrix R-Tool combined with a systematic literature review of selected papers is performed. It is identified that smart carpooling platforms could generate additional value for participants and smart cities with real-Time ride matching, interconnection with public transportation and other city services, secure transactions, reputation-based services and closed organization carpooling schemes. To deliver this value to a smart city, a multi-sided platform business model is proposed, suitable for a carpooling service provider with multiple customer segments and partners. © 2021 ACM.","Anthopoulos, L.; Tzimos, D.","30th World Wide Web Conference, WWW 2021",346,20

For several years we have been trying to convince hospital decision-makers to set it up. In the meantime, to mitigate the risks of medication errors incurred by patients and caregivers, we have set up several work teams within the care units. These teams, made up of one pharmacist and one or two hospital pharmacy technicians, who notably manage the medicine cabinets in care units. The close collaboration with doctors and nurses developed over the years was a determining factor when it became necessary to provide the newly created additional intensive care units with drugs and medical devices (MDs) in order to cope with the crisis triggered by the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. Daily monitoring of the drugs consumed by each patient, particularly neuromuscular blocking agents and MDs was a key element in managing stocks and anticipating changes of drugs, packaging and/or devices references. These facts give weight to the Claris report published in France which recognizes that the interactions of pharmacy technicians and pharmacists in the care units have positive effects in terms of quality and safety of patient care. They highlight the dangers to which patients and caregivers are exposed on Saturdays, Sundays and holidays when the pharmacy is closed. They legitimize the question of extending the opening of the pharmacy with a full team 365 days a year.","Besson, C; Chareyre, S; Kirouani, N; Jean-Jean, S; Bretagnolle, C; Henry, A; Leboucher, G; Charpiat, B",Ann. pharm. fr,346,30

RESULTS: the final sample was composed of 24 records, the content of which was synthesized in these conceptual categories: clinical manifestations, diagnosis, treatment, working pregnant women, vaccine development, complications, prenatal care, vertical transmission, and placental transmissibility. It is recommended to confirm pregnancy and disease early on, to use technological resources for screening and providing guidance and support to pregnant women. CONCLUSION: recommendations emphasize isolation, proper rest, sleep, nutrition, hydration, medications, and in the more severe cases, oxygen support, monitoring of vital signs, emotional support, and multiprofessional and individualized care. Medications should be used with caution due to a lack of evidence.

Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) is a rare neurovascular emergency that has been observed in some COVID-19 patients, yet much remains to be learnt of its underlying pathophysiology. OBJECTIVE: We present a case series of local patients with concomitant COVID-19 infection and CVT; and aim to perform a systematic review of known cases in the current literature. METHODS: We describe two patients with concomitant COVID-19 infection and CVT from a nationwide registry in Singapore. We then conducted a literature search in PubMed and Embase using a suitable keyword search strategy from 1st December 2019 to 11th June 2020. All studies reporting CVT in COVID-19 patients were included. RESULTS: Nine studies and 14 COVID-19 patients with CVT were studied. The median age was 43 years (IQR=36-58) and majority had no significant past medical conditions (60.0%). The time taken from onset of COVID-19 symptoms to CVT diagnosis was a median of 7 days (IQR=6-14). CVT was commonly seen in the transverse (75.0%) and sigmoid sinus (50.0%); 33.3% had involvement of the deep venous sinus system. A significant proportion of patients had raised D-dimer (75.0%) and CRP levels (50.0%). Two patients reported presence of antiphospholipid antibodies. Most patients received anticoagulation (91.7%) while overall mortality rate was 45.5%. CONCLUSIONS: The high mortality rate of CVT in COVID-19 infection warrants a high index of suspicion from physicians, and early treatment with anticoagulation should be initiated.","Tu, Tian Ming; Goh, Claire; Tan, Ying Kiat; Leow, Aloysius St; Pang, Yu Zhi; Chien, Jaime; Shafi, Humaira; Chan, Bernard Pl; Hui, Andrew; Koh, Jasmine; Tan, Benjamin Yq; Umapathi, N Thirugnanam; Yeo, Leonard Ll",J Stroke Cerebrovasc Dis,346,16

This report expands upon prior data and summarizes the annual prevalence (overall and by demographics) of LARC use from 2016 through 2020 among active component U.S. service women, compares LARC prevalence to the prevalence of short-acting reversible contraceptives (SARCs), and evaluates the probability of continued use of LARCs by type. LARC use increased from 21.9% to 23.9% from 2016 through 2019 while SARC use decreased from 28.3% to 24.9%. Both SARC and LARC use decreased in 2020 which may have been related to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The prevalence of intrauterine devices (IUDs) was greater than implants, and IUDs also had a higher probability of continuation than implants. At 12 months, the continuation for IUDs was 81% compared to 73% for implants. At 24 months, the probabilities of continuation were 70% for IUDs and 54% for implants. Probabilities of continuation were similar across outsourced care and direct care settings. The increased use of LARCs along with their high frequency of continuation in U.S. service women may have a positive impact on overall health and readiness.","Lotridge, J. A.; Stahlman, S.

This study aimed to examine climatic, socioeconomic and geographic risk factors for CPV infection and CPV-associated euthanasia in Australia. Australian veterinary hospital responses (534; 23.5 %) to a national veterinary survey of CPV case occurrences and euthanasias in 2016 were used. Severe caseloads (>40 cases per annum) were reported by 26 (11 %) hospitals (median 60 cases; IQR 50–110). Case reporting, case numbers, and without-treatment euthanasia were significantly associated with disadvantage across all Socio-Economic Index for Areas quintiles (p < 0.0001) – the greater the disadvantage, the more reports. Strong negative correlations were found between case numbers and the Index of Relative Socioeconomic Disadvantage (r(SP) = –0.3357, p < 0.0001) and also between euthanasia and the Index of Education and Occupation (r(SP) = –0.3762, p < 0.0001). Hospitals in more remote areas were also more likely to report cases and to euthanize without treatment (p < 0.0001). Of the climate variables, temperature of the hottest month was most strongly positively correlated with case numbers (r(SP) = 0.421, p < 0.0001), and lower annual rainfall was associated with more case-reporting hospitals (p < 0.0001). These results confirm that socioeconomic disadvantage is a significant risk-factor for CPV infection and outcome, and high temperature may also contribute to risk.","Kelman, Mark; Barrs, Vanessa R.; Norris, Jacqueline M.; Ward, Michael P.",Prev Vet Med,346,16

Significant public health gains have been made in the fight against these diseases, however, factors such as underequipped health systems, disease outbreaks, conflict, and political instability continue to challenge prevention and control. The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) introduces new challenges to public health programs in sub-Saharan Africa. Of particular concern are programs targeting major conditions among children, such as undernutrition, vaccine-preventable pneumonia and diarrhea, malaria, tuberculosis, HIV, and sickle cell disease. This article focuses on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on child health in sub-Saharan Africa. We review the epidemiology of major pediatric diseases and, referencing modeling projections, discuss the short- and long-term impact of the pandemic on major disease control. We deliberate on potential complications of SARS-CoV-2 co-infections/co-morbidities and identify critical social and ethical issues. Furthermore, we highlight the paucity of COVID-19 data and clinical trials in this region and the lack of child participants in ongoing studies. Lastly, approaches and interventions to mitigate the pandemic’s impact on child health outcomes are discussed. IMPACT: Children in sub-Saharan Africa bear a disproportionate burden of communicable and non-communicable diseases globally; this remains true even as the COVID-19 pandemic persists. Amidst the fast-expanding COVID-19 literature, there is little comprehensive coverage of the pandemic’s indirect impact on child health in sub-Saharan Africa. This article comprehensively outlines the threat that the pandemic poses to major disease prevention and control for children in sub-Saharan Africa.

Materials and Method: This cross-sectional study was performed by collecting the data from individuals belonging to various parts of the Saudi Arabian Population through an online self-reported questionnaire. The questionnaire had two main parts: first comprised of demographic data include the region of residence, gender, nationality, age, the number of family members, monthly income of the family, and the second was further divided into three sections of perception (P), practice (PRA) and oral health care practice (D) questions. All these (P, PRA, and D) were analyzed by comparing all of the demographic characteristics. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS IBM (version 21.0), and statistical significance was set at a 5% level. Results: Overall, 2013 participants (54% males and 46% females) contributed to the Saudi Arabia study. Only 5% of non-Saudis live in Saudi Arabia were participated in the study, while the majority of participants were of 21–40 years age group (45%), 59% of having more than five family members, and 60% of them had ≤10 K Suadi riyal monthly income respectively. The majority of the participants were from Riyadh (33.7%) and Asir (25.1%) in the study. Overall, 89.5% of the participants were aware of the COVID-19 global pandemic. The majority of the participants (55%) from Saudi Arabia utilized the Ministry of Health website, a source of information regarding COVID-19. However, 56.5% of the participants had COVID-19 related perception, and 74.3% followed an appropriate preventive practice. Approximately 60% had good oral health practice. The study participants showed mixed opinions on perceptions regarding COVID-19, preventive practice, and oral health practices. Conclusion: The present study suggested that the Saudi Arabian population has good attention to COVID-19, but preventive practice and oral health perception need better awareness to control this novel virus spread.

Furthermore, EBS is an excellent scavenger of reactive oxygen species. This property complicates conventional protocols for sensitizing and quenching reactive species because of potential generation of active intermediates that quickly react with EBS. In this study, the photochemical reactivity of EBS was investigated in the presence of (1) 1O2 and â¢OH sensitizers [rose Bengal (RB), perinaphthanone, and H2O2] and (2) reactive species scavenging and quenching agents (sorbic acid, isopropanol, sodium azide, and tert-butanol) that are commonly employed to study photodegradation mechanisms and kinetics. The carbon analogue of EBS, namely, 2-phenyl-3H-isoindol-1-one, was included as a reference compound to confirm the impact of the selenium atom on EBS photochemical reactivity. EBS does not undergo acid dissociation, but pH-dependent kinetics were observed in RB-sensitized solutions, suggesting EBS reaction with active intermediates (3RB2-*, O2â¢-, and H2O2) that are not kinetically relevant for other compounds. In addition, the observed rate constant of EBS increased in the presence of sorbic acid, isopropanol, and sodium azide. These findings suggest that conventional reactive species sensitizers, scavengers, and quenchers need to be carefully applied to highly reactive organoselenium compounds to account for reactions that are typically slow for other organic contaminants.","Hopanna, Mamatha; Kelly, Lisa; Blaney, Lee",Environ Sci Technol,346,1

The goal of this study was to improve the Korean EDI as a standard medical ontology in Korea. METHODS: We incorporated the EDI vocabulary into OMOP vocabulary through four main steps. First, we improved the current classification of EDI domains and separated medical services into procedures and measurements. Second, each EDI concept was assigned a unique identifier and validity dates. Third, we built a vertical hierarchy between EDI concepts, fully describing child concepts through relationships and attributes and linking them to parent terms. Finally, we added an English definition for each EDI concept. We translated the Korean definitions of EDI concepts using Google.Cloud.Translation.V3, using a client library and manual translation. We evaluated the EDI using 11 auditing criteria for controlled vocabularies. RESULTS: We incorporated 313,431 concepts from the EDI to the OMOP Standardized Vocabularies. For 10 of the 11 auditing criteria, EDI showed a better quality index within the OMOP vocabulary than in the original EDI vocabulary. CONCLUSIONS: The incorporation of the EDI vocabulary into the OMOP Standardized Vocabularies allows better standardization to facilitate network research. Our research provides a promising model for mapping Korean medical information into a global standard terminology system, although a comprehensive mapping of official vocabulary remains to be done in the future.","Seong, Yeonchan; You, Seng Chan; Ostropolets, Anna; Rho, Yeunsook; Park, Jimyung; Cho, Jaehyeong; Dymshyts, Dmitry; Reich, Christian G.; Heo, Yunjung; Park, Rae Woong",Healthc Inform Res,346,14

How do humans perceive such invitations to interact at a glance? We briefly presented participants with pictures of actors carrying out one of 11 behaviors (e.g., waving or looking at a phone) at four camera-actor distances. Participants were asked to describe what they might do in such a situation, how they decided, and what stood out most in the photograph. In addition, participants rated how likely they deemed interaction to take place. Participants formulated clear responses about how they might act. We show convincingly that what participants would do depended on the depicted behavior, but not the camera-actor distance. The likeliness to interact ratings depended both on the depicted behavior and the camera-actor distance. We conclude that humans perceive the “gist” of photographs and that various aspects of the actor, action, and context depicted in photographs are subjectively available at a glance.

As a part of the Saudi government’s attempts to contain the spread of the virus, schools’ and universities’ educational activities and face-to-face lectures have been modified to virtual classrooms. The purpose of this study was to explore the perceptions of the faculty and the students of an electronic objective structured clinical examination (E-OSCE) activity that took place during the COVID-19 pandemic in the oldest medical school in Saudi Arabia. Methods: An e-OSCE style examination was designed for the final-year medical students by the pediatrics department, College of Medicine at King Saud University in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The examination was administered by Zoom™ video conferencing where both students and faculty participated through their laptop or desktop computers. In order to explore the students’ and the faculty’s perceptions about this experience, a newly designed 13-item online questionnaire was administered at the end of the e-OSCE. Results: Out of 136 participants (23 faculty and 112 students), 73 respondents (e.g., 54% response rate) filled out the questionnaire. Most of the respondents (69.8%) were very comfortable with this new virtual experience. Most participants (53.4%) preferred the e-OSCE compared to the classic face-to-face clinical OSCE during the pandemic. Regarding the e-OSCE assessment student tool, 46.6% reported that it is similar to the classic face-to-face OSCE; however, 38.4% felt it was worse. Conclusions: The e-OSCE can be a very effective alternative to the classic face-to-face OSCE due to the current circumstances that still pose a significant risk of infection transmission. Future studies should examine different virtual strategies to ensure effective OSCE delivery from the perspective of both faculty and students.","Shaiba, Lana A.; Alnamnakani, Mahdi A.; Temsah, Mohamad-Hani; Alamro, Nurah; Alsohime, Fahad; Alrabiaah, Abdulkarim; Alanazi, Shahad N.; Alhasan, Khalid; Alherbish, Adi; Mobaireek, Khalid F.; Bashiri, Fahad A.; AlRuthia, Yazed",Healthcare (Basel),346,1

The number of cases increased rapidly and spread to six continents. However, there is limited information on the chest computed tomography (CT) results of affected patients. Chest CT can assess the severity of COVID-19 and has sufficient sensitivity to assess changes in response to glucocorticoid therapy. OBJECTIVE: Analyze COVID-19 patients to determine the relationships of clinical characteristics, chest CT score, and levels of inflammatory mediators. METHODS: This retrospective, single-center case series of 108 consecutive hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 at Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College of HUST (Wuhan, China) examined patients admitted from January 28 to February 20, 2020. Patient demographics, comorbidities, clinical findings, chest CT results, and CT scores of affected lung parenchyma were recorded. The relationships between chest CT score with levels of systemic inflammatory mediators were determined. RESULTS: All patients exhibited signs of significant systemic inflammation, including increased levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), procalcitonin, chest CT score, and a decreased lymphocyte (LY) count. Chest CT score had positive associations with white blood cell (WBC) count, CRP, ESR, procalcitonin, and abnormal coagulation function, and a negative association with LY count. Treatment with a glucocorticoid increased the LY count, reduced the CT score and CRP level, and improved coagulation function. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 infection is characterized by a systemic inflammatory response that affects the lungs, blood, digestive system, and circulatory systems. The chest CT score is a good indicator of the extent of systemic inflammation. Glucocorticoid treatment appears to reduce systemic inflammation in these patients.","Zhang, Jie; Meng, Guangping; Li, Wei; Shi, Bingqing; Dong, Hongna; Su, Zhenzhong; Huang, Qian; Gao, Peng",Respir Res,346,1

These factors have led to the implementation of team nursing as a model of nursing care out of necessity for resource allocation. Nurses can use prior evidence to inform the model of nursing care and reimagine patient care responsibilities during a crisis. PURPOSE: To review the evidence for team nursing as a model of patient care and delegation and determine how it affects patient, nurse, and organizational outcomes. METHODS: We conducted an integrative review of team nursing and delegation using Whittemore and Knafl’s (2005) methodology. RESULTS: We identified 22 team nursing articles, 21 delegation articles, and two papers about U.S. nursing laws and scopes of practice for delegation. Overall, team nursing had varied effects on patient, nursing, and organizational outcomes compared with other nursing care models. Education regarding delegation is critical for team nursing, and evidence indicates that it improves nurses’ delegation knowledge, decision‐making, and competency. LINKING EVIDENCE TO ACTION: Team nursing had both positive and negative outcomes for patients, nurses, and the organization.

Our aim was to assess the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on the number and severity of cases for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in Japan. Methods Using claims data from the Quality Indicator/Improvement Project (QIP) database, we included urgent cases of inpatients for CAP from August 1, 2018, to July 30, 2020. We compared the monthly ratio of inpatient cases from August 2018 to July 2019 and August 2019 to July 2020 as a year-over-year comparison. We also compared this ratio according to the severity score “A-DROP” and performed an interrupted time series (ITS) analysis to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on the monthly number of inpatient cases. Results A total of 67,900 inpatient cases for CAP in 262 hospitals were included. During the COVID-19 epidemic (defined as the period between March and July 2020), the number of inpatient cases for CAP drastically decreased during the epidemic compared with the same period in the past year (-48.1%), despite only a temporary reduction in the number of other urgent admissions. The number of inpatient cases decreased according to the severity of pneumonia. Milder cases showed a greater decrease in the year-over-year ratio than severe ones (mild -55.2%, moderate -45.8%, severe -39.4%, and extremely severe -33.2%). The ITS analysis showed that the COVID-19 epidemic reduced the monthly number of inpatient cases for CAP significantly (estimated decrease: -1233 cases; 95% CI, -521 to -1955). Conclusions Our study showed a significant reduction in the number of inpatient cases for CAP during the COVID-19 epidemic in Japan. The milder cases showed a greater decrease in the year-over-year ratio of the number of inpatient cases.","Nagano, Hiroyuki; Takada, Daisuke; Shin, Jung-ho; Morishita, Tetsuji; Kunisawa, Susumu; Imanaka, Yuichi",Int J Infect Dis,346,5

Hence, this study aims to evaluate and compare factors affecting the older adults’ travel mode choice to investigate transportation policies for increasing their independent mobility in the post-outbreak that has not been addressed in previous research. METHODOLOGY: The population of this cross-sectional study consisted of Isfahan citizens aged 60 years and over. For interviews based on a structured questionnaire, 453 participants were randomly selected in 15 municipality districts of Isfahan. Multinomial logistic models were used to analyze the data. FINDINGS: The results show that despite the decrease in the average frequency of travels per week, the increase in the share of walking and cycling modes, making shopping and recreational travels on foot, and cycling can indicate the resilience of walking and cycling in critical situations. The results also reveal that active modes have effective roles in the older adults’ mobility in the post-outbreak because they are not subject to traffic restrictions like private vehicles and social constraints and crowd avoidance like public transportation. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Policies such as the proper location of facilities, increasing density and mixing of land uses, landscaping, traffic reduction, increasing ownership of bicycle and tricycle (to eliminate the problems of falling in getting on and off the bicycles), driving training courses for the safe driving, and intersections safety improvement are essential to maintain the older adults' mobility after the outbreak.

This survey assessed the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on UK and Ireland-based breast pathologists to optimise working environments and ensure preparedness for potential future pandemics. METHODS: A 35-question survey during the first wave of COVID-19 infections in the UK including questions on workload, working practices, professional development, training, health and safety and well-being was distributed to consultant breast pathologists and responses collected anonymously. RESULTS: There were 135 responses from breast pathologists based in the UK and Ireland. Most participants (75.6%) stated that their workload had decreased and their productivity dropped. 86/135 (63.7%) were given the option of working from home and 36% of those who did reported improved efficiency. Multidisciplinary team meetings largely moved to virtual platforms (77.8%) with fewer members present (41.5%). Online education, including webinars and courses, was utilised by 92.6%. 16.3% of pathologists reported shortages of masks, visors or gowns as the the most common health and safety concern.

We studied the implementation and the effectiveness of the virtual Graded Repetitive Arm Supplementary (GRASP) Program delivered and evaluated via videoconferencing in individuals with stroke. METHODS: The RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance) framework with mixed methods was used to evaluate the implementation of the two iterations of the program delivered by a nonprofit organization during the pandemic. RESULTS: REACH: Seventeen people were screened, 13 people were eligible, and 11 consented to participate in the study. EFFECTIVENESS: Between baseline and post-test, participants with stroke demonstrated significant improvement in upper extremity function (Arm Capacity and Movement Test) and self-perceived UE function (Stroke Impact Scale). ADOPTION: Factors that facilitate program uptake by the staff were well-planned implementation, appropriate screening procedure, and helpful feedback from the audits. All staff felt comfortable using videoconferencing technology to deliver the program despite some technical difficulties. Factors contributing to ongoing participation included that the participants liked the group, they perceived improvements, and the instructor was encouraging. Only one participant with stroke was not comfortable using videoconferencing technology. IMPLEMENTAION: The program was implemented as intended as evaluated by a fidelity checklist. Participants’ adherence was high, as verified by the average attendance and practice time. MAINTENANCE: The organization continued to offer the program. CONCLUSION: The virtual GRASP program was successfully implemented. Although the program was effective in improving both measured and perceived UE function in a small sample of individuals with stroke, caution should be taken in generalizing the results. IMPACT: Implementing telerehabilitation is crucial to optimize patient outcomes and reduce the spread of COVID-19. Our findings provide guidance on the process of delivering a UE rehabilitation program remotely via videoconferencing for stroke. Moreover, insights that arise from this study also inform the implementation of other telerehabilitation services.","Yang, Chieh-ling; Waterson, Seonaid; Eng, Janice J",Phys Ther,346,24

Blood transcriptomic biomarkers that prospectively predict those who progress to leprosy (progressors) would allow early diagnosis, better treatment outcomes and facilitate interventions aimed at stopping bacterial transmission. To identify potential risk signatures of leprosy, we collected whole blood of household contacts (HC, n=5,352) of leprosy patients, including individuals who were diagnosed with leprosy 4-61 months after sample collection. METHODS: We investigated differential gene expression (DGE) by RNA-Seq between progressors before presence of symptoms (n=40) and HC (n=40), as well as longitudinal DGE within each progressor. A prospective leprosy signature was identified using a machine learning approach (Random Forest) and validated using reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). FINDINGS: Although no significant intra-individual longitudinal variation within leprosy progressors was identified, 1,613 genes were differentially expressed in progressors before diagnosis compared to HC. We identified a 13-gene prospective risk signature with an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 95.2%. Validation of this RNA-Seq signature in an additional set of progressors (n=43) and HC (n=43) by RT-qPCR, resulted in a final 4-gene signature, designated RISK4LEP (MT-ND2, REX1BD, TPGS1, UBC) (AUC=86.4%). INTERPRETATION: This study identifies for the first time a prospective transcriptional risk signature in blood predicting development of leprosy 4 to 61 months before clinical diagnosis. Assessment of this signature in contacts of leprosy patients can function as an adjunct diagnostic tool to target implementation of interventions to restrain leprosy development.

In the context of a highly contagious communicable disease, telemedicine is a useful alternative to usual care, and should be considered as a means to support healthcare professionals’ mental health. This is a multicenter (n = 19), cross-sectional study, based on a 27-item questionnaire, aiming to investigate the acceptability to healthcare workers of a telepsychiatry service as a means of providing mental health support during the COVID-19 pandemic. Between October and December 2020, 321 responses were received, showing that women, caregiving staff, and those directly involved in the care of COVID-19 patients are less favorable to the idea of receiving remote support. In our population, barriers were related to the clinical setting or ethics, and most of the respondents would not accept a drug prescription by telepsychiatry. Although telepsychiatry should be a part of the armamentarium of mental health management, it is not suitable as a stand-alone approach, and should be combined with conventional face-to-face consultations.","Cormi, Clément; Sanchez, Stéphane; de l’Estoile, Valentine; Ollivier, Laura; Letty, Aude; Berrut, Gilles; Mulin, Emmanuel",Int J Environ Res Public Health,346,17

Chronic respiratory conditions were self-reported and included asthma (14.7%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD (4.7%), and bronchitis/emphysema (11.6%). We used multivariable Poisson regression to evaluate physical health symptoms. We estimated associations of mental health symptoms using multinomial logistic regression. In multivariable models, adults with asthma were more likely to report physical symptoms including runny or stuffy nose, chest congestion, fever, and chills. In addition, adults with COPD were more likely to report several physical symptoms including fever (adjusted prevalence ratio [aPR]: 1.37, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.09–1.72), chills (aPR: 2.10, 95% CI: 1.67–2.64), runny or stuffy nose (aPR: 1.78, 95% CI: 1.39–2.27), chest congestion (aPR: 2.14, 95% CI: 1.74–2.61), sneezing (aPR: 1.59, 95% CI: 1.23–2.05), and muscle or body aches (aPR: 1.38, 95% CI: 1.06–1.81).

The Chinese government has formulated effective response measures, and medical personnel have been actively responding to challenges associated with the epidemic prevention and control strategies. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of the implementation of a care transition pathway on patients that underwent joint replacement during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A quasi-experimental study was designed to evaluate the effect of implementing a care transition pathway for patients who underwent joint replacement during the COVID-19 pandemic in the orthopedic department of a tertiary care hospital in Beijing, China. Using a convenient sampling method, a total of 96 patients were selected. Of these, 51 patients who had undergone joint replacement in 2019 and received treatment via the routine nursing path were included in the control group. The remaining 45 patients who underwent joint replacement during the COVID-19 epidemic in 2020 and received therapy via the care transition pathway due to the implementation of epidemic prevention and control measures were included in the observation group. The quality of care transition was assessed by the Care Transition Measure (CTM), and patients were followed up 1 week after discharge. RESULTS: The observation group was determined to have better general self-care preparation, written planning materials, doctor-patient communication, health monitoring, and quality of care transition than the control group. CONCLUSIONS: A care transition pathway was developed to provide patients with care while transitioning through periods of treatment. It improved the patient perceptions of nursing quality.

Data acquired from 28 long-term air quality stations across the U.S. revealed widespread but nonuniform reductions of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and carbon monoxide (CO) during the first phase of lockdown (March 15–April 25, 2020) relative to a pre-lockdown reference period and historical baselines established in 2017–2019. The reductions, up to 49% for NO2 and 37% for CO, are statistically significant at two thirds of the sites and tend to increase with local population density. Significant reductions of particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) only occurred in the Northeast and California/Nevada metropolises where NO2 declined the most, while the changes in ozone (O3) were mixed and relatively minor. These findings are consistent with lower transportation and utility demands that dominate NO2 and CO emissions, especially in major urban areas, due to the lockdown. This study provides an insight into potential public health benefits with more aggressive air quality management, which should be factored into strategies to reopen the U.S. and global economy.","Chen, L.-W.

To this end, Multivariate Hawkes Processes (MHP) have become a fundamental tool because they model social network dynamics, which facilitates execution and evaluation of mitigation policies. In this paper, we propose a novel light-weight intervention-based misinformation mitigation framework using decentralized Learning Automata (LA) to control the MHP. Each automaton is associated with a single user and learns to what degree that user should be involved in the mitigation strategy by interacting with a corresponding MHP, and performing a joint random walk over the state space. We use three Twitter datasets to evaluate our approach, one of them being a new COVID-19 dataset provided in this paper. Our approach shows fast convergence and increased valid information exposure. These results persisted independently of network structure, including networks with central nodes, where the latter could be the root of misinformation. Further, the LA obtained these results in a decentralized manner, facilitating distributed deployment in real-life scenarios.","Abouzeid, Ahmed; Granmo, Ole-Christoffer; Webersik, Christian; Goodwin, Morten",Inf Syst Front,346,28

METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional online survey with consenting parents of babies born in South Africa during 2020. Factors associated with negative birth emotions and probable depression were estimated using logistic regression. RESULTS: Most of the 520 respondents were females (n = 496, 95%) who gave birth at private hospitals (n = 426, 86%). Mothers reported having overall positive birth emotions (n = 399, 80%). Multivariable analysis showed that having a preterm baby (aOR 2.89; CI 1.51-5.53) and the mother self-reporting that Covid-19 affected her birth experience (aOR 4.25; CI 2.08-8.68) increased the odds of mothers reporting predominantly negative emotions about their birth.

The goal of this study was to capture the challenges ECRs are facing during the pandemic and the supports that are needed for career development and research. ECRs were invited to complete an online survey that focused on four major areas; the impact of COVID‐19 on their research; changes in productivity due to COVID‐19; changes to training due to COVID‐19; and current mental health. 150 ECRs were eligible and provided sufficient data for inclusion. All but one ECRs reported their research had been negatively impacted by the pandemic. Reductions in productivity were reported by 85% of ECRs. The biggest impacts included recruitment of participants, increased needs at home and personal mental health. ECRs reported a 3‐fold increase in burnout, as well as increased anxiety. ECR supports, such as funding, flexibility, and tenure extensions, are required to ensure ASD research does not suffer from a “lost generation” of researchers.

However, researchers in the earliest phases of their career, specifically postdoctoral fellows through individuals in assistant professor (or equivalent) positions, are particularly vulnerable to long‐lasting effects of pandemic‐related disruptions which may limit their ability to continue as autism researchers. This survey highlights the needs of this group and identifies mechanisms by which these early career researchers may be supported in this time. This is critical to ensure the next generation of ASD researchers and clinician scientists continue on the path to advancing understanding of autism in the decades to come.","Harrop, Clare; Bal, Vanessa; Carpenter, Kimberly; Halladay, Alycia",Autism Res,346,24

However, the lowest cutoff diameter of commercially available liquid impingers was about 0.3 μm, and the physical collection efficiency for nano-bioaerosol is only about 10–20%. Here, we enhanced the impinger’s collection efficiency and recovery of viable viral aerosols by using packed glass beads and selected sampling media (1% peptone and lysogeny broth, LB). Single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) MS2 bacteriophage with uranine (as a physical tracer) was used as model viral aerosols. The effects of different sampling flow rates (4, 6, and 12.5 L per minute) and different sampling time (10, 20, and 30 min) on the collection efficiency and recovery of MS2 aerosols were also tested. Collection efficiency and recovery of viable viral aerosols were analyzed as a function of sampling media, flow rate, and sampling time and packed glass beads by using a general linear model. Although the packed glass beads considerably enhanced the collection efficiency of the liquid impinger for MS2 aerosols, the recovery of viable MS2 becomes lower due to the higher pressure drop across the impinger. Using peptone or LB as sampling media, reducing sampling flow rate, and decreasing sampling time was proven to improve the recovery of viable MS2. Conclusively, this study provides some practical methods to improve the collection efficiency of liquid impinger for viral aerosols and preserve their viability.","Chen, Yen-Chi; Wang, I-Jen; Cheng, Chih-Ching; Wu, Yu-Chiao; Bai, Chun-Hsuan; Yu, Kuo-Pin",Aerobiologia (Bologna),346,10

Epitopes in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S ill reacted with the convalescent serums. Of note, two peptides non-specifically interacted with most of the non-COVID-19 serums. Neutralization assay indicated that only five serums completely blocked viral infection at the dilution of 1:200. By using a peptide-compete neutralizing assay, we found that three dominant epitopes partially competed the neutralization activity of several convalescent serums, suggesting antibodies elicited by these epitopes played an important role in neutralizing viral infection.

We thus conducted a nationwide cohort study to estimate the effects of environmental factors [temperature, particulate matter (PM2.5, PM10), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and ozone (O3)] on COVID-19 case fatality. A total of 71,808 confirmed COVID-19 cases were identified and followed up for their vital status through April 25, 2020. Exposures to ambient air pollution and temperature were estimated by linking the city- and county-level monitoring data to the residential community of each participant. For each participant, two windows were defined: the period from symptom onset to diagnosis (Exposure Window Ⅰ), and the period from the diagnosis date to date of death/recovery or end of the study period (Exposure Window Ⅱ). Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the associations between these environmental factors and COVID-19 case fatality. COVID-19 case fatality increased in association with environmental factors for two exposure windows. For example, each 10 ug/m3 increase of PM2.5, PM10, O3 and NO2 in Window I was associated with a hazard ratio of 1.11 (95% CI: 1.09, 1.13), 1.10 (95% CI: 1.08, 1.13), 1.09 (95 CI: 1.03, 1.14) and 1.27 (95% CI: 1.19, 1.35) for COVID-19 fatality, respectively. A significant effect was also observed for low temperature, with a hazard ratio of 1.03 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.04) for COVID-19 case fatality per each 1°C decrease. Subgroup analysis indicated that these effects were stronger in the elderly, as well as those with mild symptoms and living in Wuhan or Hubei. Overall, the sensitivity analyses also yielded the consistent estimates.

We used a microsimulation model to evaluate clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness of a COVID-19 vaccination program in South Africa. We varied vaccination coverage, pace, acceptance, effectiveness, and cost as well as epidemic dynamics. Providing vaccine to at least 40% of the population and prioritizing accelerated vaccine rollout prevented >9 million infections and >73,000 deaths and reduced costs due to fewer hospitalizations. Further, the vaccination program was cost-saving even at the lowest examined levels of acceptance (50%), effectiveness against infection (20%), effectiveness against symptomatic disease (30%), and effectiveness against severe/critical disease requiring hospitalization (40%), and with vaccination costs of up to USD25/person. In summary, a COVID-19 vaccination program would reduce both deaths and health care costs in South Africa across a wide range of assumptions. Vaccination program implementation factors, including prompt procurement, distribution, and rollout, are likely more influential than characteristics of the vaccine itself in maximizing public health benefits and economic efficiency.","Reddy, Krishna P.; Fitzmaurice, Kieran P.; Scott, Justine A.; Harling, Guy; Lessells, Richard J.; Panella, Christopher; Shebl, Fatma M.; Freedberg, Kenneth A.; Siedner, Mark J.",medRxiv,346,21

B cell responses to these “common cold” viruses remain incompletely understood. Here we report a comprehensive analysis of CoV-specific antibody repertoires in 231 children and 1168 adults using phage-immunoprecipitation sequencing. Seroprevalence of antibodies to endemic HCoVs ranged between ~4 and 27% depending on the species and cohort. We identified at least 136 novel linear B cell epitopes. Antibody repertoires against endemic HCoVs were qualitatively different between children and adults in that anti-HCoV IgG specificities more frequently found among children targeted functionally important and structurally conserved regions of the spike, nucleocapsid and matrix proteins. Moreover, antibody specificities targeting the highly conserved fusion peptide region and S2’ cleavage site of the spike protein were broadly cross-reactive with peptides of epidemic human and non-human coronaviruses. In contrast, an acidic tandem repeat in the N-terminal region of the Nsp3 subdomain of the HCoV-HKU1 polyprotein was the predominant target of antibody responses in adult donors. Our findings shed light on the dominant species-specific and pan-CoV target sites of human antibody responses to coronavirus infection, thereby providing important insights for the development of prophylactic or therapeutic monoclonal antibodies and vaccine design.","Khan, Taushif; Rahman, Mahbuba; Ali, Fatima Al; Huang, Susie S.

In addition, the mutation of virus strains that have accompanied the pandemic has brought more severe challenges to pandemic control. Host microRNAs (miRNAs) are widely involved in a variety of biological processes of coronavirus infection, including autophagy in SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the mechanisms underlying miRNAs involved in autophagy in SARS-CoV-2 infection have not been fully elucidated. In this study, the miRNA and messenger RNA (mRNA) expression profiles of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were investigated based on raw data from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets, and potential novel biomarkers of autophagy were revealed by bioinformatics analyses. We identified 32 differentially expressed miRNAs and 332 differentially expressed mRNAs in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Cytokine receptor related pathways were the most enriched pathways for differentially expressed miRNAs identified by pathway analysis. Most importantly, an autophagy interaction network, which was associated with the pathological processes of SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially with the cytokine storm, was constructed. In this network, hsa-miR-340–3p, hsa-miR-652–3p, hsa-miR-4772–5p, hsa-miR-192–5p, TP53INP2, and CCR2 may be biomarkers that predict changes in mild SARS-CoV-2 infection. Some molecules, including hsa-miR-1291 and CXCR4, were considered potential targets to predict the emergence of severe symptoms in SARS-CoV-2 infection. To our knowledge, this study provided the first profile analysis of an autophagy interaction network in SARS-CoV-2 infection and revealed several novel autophagy-related biomarkers for understanding the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in vivo.","Chen, Zhihao; Wang, Xi; Li, Liubing; Han, Mingxiao; Wang, Min; Li, Ziyuan; Xie, Xiaolu; Du, Hong; Xie, Zonggang; Zhang, Haifang",Microb Pathog,346,27

The objective of this study is to establish an accurate model for 25(OH)D(3) pharmacokinetics (PKs) to support selection of a suitable dose regimen for an individual. We collated vitamin D(3) and 25(OH)D(3) plasma PK data from reported clinical trials and developed a physiologically‐based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model to appropriately recapitulate training data. Model predictions were then qualified with 25(OH)D(3) plasma PKs under vitamin D(3) and 25(OH)D(3) dose regimens distinct from training data. From data exploration, we observed the increase in plasma 25(OH)D(3) after repeated dosing was negatively correlated with 25(OH)D(3) baseline levels. Our final model included a first‐order vitamin D(3) absorption, a first‐order vitamin D(3) metabolism, and a nonlinear 25(OH)D(3) elimination function. This structure explained the apparent paradox. Remarkably, the model accurately predicted plasma 25(OH)D(3) following repeated dosing up to 1250 μg/d in the test set. It also made sensible predictions for large single vitamin D(3) doses up to 50,000 μg in the test set. Model predicts 10 μg/d regimen may be ineffective for achieving sufficiency (plasma 25(OH)D(3) ≥ 75 nmol/L) for a severely deficient individual (baseline 25(OH)D(3) = 10 nmol/L), and it might take the same person over 200 days to reach sufficiency at 20 μg/d dose. We propose to personalize vitamin D(3) supplementation protocol with this PBPK model. It would require measuring 25(OH)D(3) baseline levels, which is not routinely performed under the current UK public health advice. STUDY HIGHLIGHTS: WHAT IS THE CURRENT KNOWLEDGE ON THE TOPIC? Vitamin D PK exhibits substantial inter‐individual variability. Different officially recommended daily doses are confusing. : WHAT QUESTION DID THIS STUDY ADDRESS? Is the UK’s recommended 10 µg daily dose sufficient? Should everyone be given same dose? : WHAT DOES THIS STUDY ADD TO OUR KNOWLEDGE? Our model accurately predicts plasma 25(OH)D under daily oral administration of vitamin D(3). The 10 µg daily vitamin D(3) dose is insufficient for prophylaxis (plasma 25(OH)D at 75 nmol/L). : HOW MIGHT THIS CHANGE DRUG DISCOVERY, DEVELOPMENT, AND/OR THERAPEUTICS? Combining blood test to measure 25(OH)D baseline with this PBPK model will help inform dosage selection and select follow‐up date to improve effectiveness of Hypovitaminosis D treatment.","Huang, Zhonghui; You, Tao",CPT Pharmacometrics Syst Pharmacol,346,1

However, the number of confirmed cases depends on the testing policy, and it is important to understand how the number of positive cases obtained using different testing policies reveals the unknown ground truth. We develop an agent-based simulation framework in Python that can simulate various testing policies as well as interventions such as lockdown based on them. The interaction between the agents can take into account various communities and mobility patterns. A distinguishing feature of our framework is the presence of another ‘flu’-like illness with symptoms similar to COVID-19, that allows us to model the noise in selecting the pool of patients to be tested. We instantiate our model for the city of Bengaluru in India, using census data to distribute agents geographically, and traffic flow mobility data to model long-distance interactions and mixing. We use the simulation framework to compare the performance of three testing policies: Random Symptomatic Testing (RST), Contact Tracing (CT), and a new Location-Based Testing policy (LBT). We observe that if a sufficient fraction of symptomatic patients come out for testing, then RST can capture the ground truth quite closely even with very few daily tests. However, CT consistently captures more positive cases. Interestingly, our new LBT, which is operationally less intensive than CT, gives performance that is comparable with CT. In another direction, we compare the efficacy of these three testing policies in enabling lockdown, and observe that CT flattens the ground truth curve maximally, followed closely by LBT, and significantly better than RST.","Gopalan, Aditya; Tyagi, Himanshu",J Indian Inst Sci,346,26

In infectious diseases, corticosteroids have been regarded as a thread due to their immunosuppressive effects and therefore their anti-inflammatory properties. MAIN: In recent years, there have been several studies published that aimed to determine the role of corticosteroids in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), because, despite significant advances in new antibiotics and supportive care, deaths of patients with CAP remain unacceptably high. While the 2007 Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA)/American Thoracic Society (ATS) CAP guidelines did not mention the use of corticosteroids in the management of CAP, the recently published 2019 IDSA/ATS guidelines recommended their use in patients with septic shock refractory to vasopressors and fluid resuscitation. Regarding viral infection, the use of corticosteroids in patients with influenza has shown to be associated with significantly higher mortality and higher incidence of nosocomial infection, while in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) there is a good body of evidence of the benefit of corticosteroids in terms of mortality. CONCLUSIONS: The use of corticosteroids has been considered as a potential alternative co-adjuvant treatment in patients with pneumonia. In patients with COVID-19, the evidence is quite strong and there is a clear benefit of the use of corticosteroids in those patients presenting severe forms of disease.","Martin-Loeches, Ignacio; Torres, Antoni",Eur Respir Rev,346,26

The authors concluded that elevations in RDW were associated with adverse COVID-19 outcomes. However, the impact of elevation of RDW independent of anemia in COVID-19 remains to be clarified. METHODS Patients ≥18 years who were diagnosed with COVID-19 at the Mount Sinai Health System between March 1 and April 1, 2020 and had a complete blood count (CBC) at presentation (n=2562) were selected to assess the association between RDW and mortality. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models, stratified by presence of anemia, were performed to assess the independent association of RDW with mechanical ventilation and mortality. RESULTS At univariate analysis, elevated RDW was statistically significantly associated with mechanical ventilation (p = 0.0109) and mortality (p < 0.0001). We found that elevated RDW was statistically associated with higher risk of both being placed on a ventilator (HRadj: 1.66, 95% CI: 1.19-2.32) and mortality (HRadj: 1.60, 95% CI: 1.18-2.15) in non-anemic patients, but there was no association in anemic patients. These associations were independent of the effects of age, sex, race, and CCI. DISCUSSION In this study, we show that the elevated RDW association with mortality and mechanical ventilation is present exclusively in non-anemic patients. Therefore, we propose that RDW be considered by clinicians, especially in non-anemic patients, when risk-stratifying COVID-19 patients. This article is protected by copyright.

Triage should be done for all patients coming to the health-care facility. Temperature and other vital parameters should be recorded in our daily practice. Antibacterial mouth rinses before the dental procedure can reduce the microbial load and therefore can alleviate transmission.

Eleven RCTs in a meta‐analysis studying other respiratory illnesses found no significant benefit of masks (±hand hygiene) for influenza‐like‐illness symptoms nor laboratory confirmed viruses. One RCT found a significant benefit of surgical masks compared with cloth masks. CONCLUSION: There is limited available preclinical and clinical evidence for face mask benefit in SARS‐CoV‐2. RCT evidence for other respiratory viral illnesses shows no significant benefit of masks in limiting transmission but is of poor quality and not SARS‐CoV‐2 specific. There is an urgent need for evidence from randomized controlled trials to investigate the efficacy of surgical and cloth masks on transmission of SARS‐CoV‐2 and user reported outcomes such as comfort and compliance.","Nanda, Akriti; Hung, Ivan; Kwong, Ava; Man, Vivian Chi‐Mei; Roy, Pankaj; Davies, Lucy; Douek, Michael",J Evid Based Med,346,16
