176,Alternative medicines for AIDS in resource-poor settings: Insights from exploratory anthropological studies in Asia and Africa,2008-07-10,"The emergence of alternative medicines for AIDS in Asia and Africa was discussed at a satellite symposium and the parallel session on alternative and traditional treatments of the AIDSImpact meeting, held in Marseille, in July 2007. These medicines are heterogeneous, both in their presentation and in their geographic and cultural origin. The sessions focused on the role of these medications in selected resource poor settings in Africa and Asia now that access to anti-retroviral therapy is increasing. The aims of the sessions were to (1) identify the actors involved in the diffusion of these alternative medicines for HIV/AIDS, (2) explore uses and forms, and the way these medicines are given legitimacy, (3) reflect on underlying processes of globalisation and cultural differentiation, and (4) define priority questions for future research in this area. This article presents the insights generated at the meeting, illustrated with some findings from the case studies (Uganda, Senegal, Benin, Burkina Faso, China and Indonesia) that were presented. These case studies reveal the wide range of actors who are involved in the marketing and supply of alternative medicines. Regulatory mechanisms are weak. The efficacy claims of alternative medicines often reinforce a biomedical paradigm for HIV/AIDS, and fit with a healthy living ideology promoted by AIDS care programs and support groups. The AIDSImpact session concluded that more interdisciplinary research is needed on the experience of people living with HIV/AIDS with these alternative medicines, and on the ways in which these products interact (or not) with anti-retroviral therapy at pharmacological as well as psychosocial levels.","Hardon, Anita; Desclaux, Alice; Egrot, Marc; Simon, Emmanuelle; Micollier, Evelyne; Kyakuwa, Margaret",J Ethnobiol Ethnomed,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2503967/,101
1714,Year in review 2013: critical care - respiratory infections,2014-10-29,"Infectious complications, particularly in the respiratory tract of critically ill patients, are related to increased mortality. Severe infection is part of a multiple system illness and female patients with severe sepsis have a worse prognosis compared to males. Kallistatin is a protective hormokine released during monocyte activation and low levels in the setting of septic shock can predict adverse outcomes. Presepsin is another biomarker that was recently evaluated and is elevated in patients with severe sepsis patients at risk of dying. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has introduced new definitions for identifying patients at risk of ventilator-associated complications (VACs), but several other conditions, such as pulmonary edema and acute respiratory distress syndrome, may cause VACs, and not all patients with VACs may have ventilator-associated pneumonia. New studies have suggested strategies to identify patients at risk for resistant pathogen infection and therapies that optimize efficacy, without the overuse of broad-spectrum therapy in patients with healthcare-associated pneumonia. Innovative strategies using optimized dosing of antimicrobials, maximizing the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of drugs in critically ill patients, and newer routes of drug delivery are being explored to combat drug-resistant pathogens. We summarize the major clinical studies on respiratory infections in critically ill patients published in 2013.","Nair, Girish B; Niederman, Michael S",Crit Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4330923/,101
1848,Human resource crises in German hospitals—an explorative study,2015-05-28,"BACKGROUND: The complexity of providing medical care in a high-tech environment with a highly specialized, limited labour force makes hospitals more crisis-prone than other industries. An effective defence against crises is only possible if the organizational resilience and the capacity to handle crises become part of the hospitals’ organizational culture. To become more resilient to crises, a raised awareness—especially in the area of human resource (HR)—is necessary. The aim of this paper is to contribute to the process robustness against crises through the identification and evaluation of relevant HR crises and their causations in hospitals. METHODS: Qualitative and quantitative methods were combined to identify and evaluate crises in hospitals in the HR sector. A structured workshop with experts was conducted to identify HR crises and their descriptions, as well as causes and consequences for patients and hospitals. To evaluate the findings, an online survey was carried out to rate the occurrence (past, future) and dangerousness of each crisis. RESULTS: Six HR crises were identified in this study: staff shortages, acute loss of personnel following a pandemic, damage to reputation, insufficient communication during restructuring, bullying, and misuse of drugs. The highest occurrence probability in the future was seen in staff shortages, followed by acute loss of personnel following a pandemic. Staff shortages, damage to reputation, and acute loss of personnel following a pandemic were seen as the most dangerous crises. CONCLUSIONS: The study concludes that coping with HR crises in hospitals is existential for hospitals and requires increased awareness. The six HR crises identified occurred regularly in German hospitals in the past, and their occurrence probability for the future was rated as high.","Schermuly, Carsten C; Draheim, Michael; Glasberg, Ronald; Stantchev, Vladimir; Tamm, Gerrit; Hartmann, Michael; Hessel, Franz",Hum Resour Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4453019/,101
2591,Prioritizing zoonotic diseases in Ethiopia using a one health approach,2016-09-15,"BACKGROUND: Ethiopia has the second largest human population in Africa and the largest livestock population on the continent. About 80% of Ethiopians are dependent on agriculture and have direct contact with livestock or other domestic animals. As a result, the country is vulnerable to the spread of zoonotic diseases. As the first step of the country's engagement in the Global Health Security Agenda, a zoonotic disease prioritization workshop was held to identify significant zoonotic diseases of mutual concern for animal and human health agencies. METHODS: A semi-quantitative tool developed by the US CDC was used for prioritization of zoonotic diseases. Workshop participants representing human, animal, and environmental health ministries were selected as core decision-making participants. Over 300 articles describing the zoonotic diseases considered at the workshop were reviewed for disease specific information on prevalence, morbidity, mortality, and DALYs for Ethiopia or the East Africa region. Committee members individually ranked the importance of each criterion to generate a final group weight for each criterion. RESULTS: Forty-three zoonotic diseases were evaluated. Criteria selected in order of importance were: 1)severity of disease in humans, 2)proportion of human disease attributed to animal exposure, 3)burden of animal disease, 4)availability of interventions, and 5)existing inter-sectoral collaboration. Based on the results from the decision tree analysis and subsequent discussion, participants identified the following five priority zoonotic diseases: rabies, anthrax, brucellosis, leptospirosis, and echinococcosis. DISCUSSION: Multi-sectoral collaborations strengthen disease surveillance system development in humans and animals, enhance laboratory capacity, and support implementation of prevention and control strategies. To facilitate this, the creation of a One Health-focused Zoonotic Disease Unit is recommended. Enhancement of public health and veterinary laboratories, joint outbreak and surveillance activities, and intersectoral linkages created to tackle the prioritized zoonotic diseases will undoubtedly prepare the country to effectively address newly emerging zoonotic diseases.","Pieracci, Emily G.; Hall, Aron J.; Gharpure, Radhika; Haile, Abraham; Walelign, Elias; Deressa, Asefa; Bahiru, Getahun; Kibebe, Meron; Walke, Henry; Ermias Belay",One Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5315415/,101
3443,SMS-based smartphone application for disease surveillance has doubled completeness and timeliness in a limited-resource setting – evaluation of a 15-week pilot program in Central African Republic (CAR),2018-10-24,"BACKGROUND: It is a challenge in low-resource settings to ensure the availability of complete, timely disease surveillance information. Smartphone applications (apps) have the potential to enhance surveillance data transmission. METHODS: The Central African Republic (CAR) Ministry of Health and Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) conducted a 15-week pilot project to test a disease surveillance app, Argus, for 20 conditions in 21 health centers in Mambéré Kadéi district (MK 2016). Results were compared to the usual paper-based surveillance in MK the year prior (MK 2015) and simultaneously in an adjacent health district, Nana-Mambére (NM 2016). Wilcoxon rank sum and Kaplan-Meier analyses compared report completeness and timeliness; the cost of the app, and users’ perceptions of its usability were assessed. RESULTS: Two hundred seventy-one weekly reports sent by app identified 3403 cases and 63 deaths; 15 alerts identified 28 cases and 4 deaths. Median completeness (IQR) for MK 2016, 81% (81–86%), was significantly higher than in MK 2015 (31% (24–36%)), and NM 2016 (52% (48–57)) (p < 0.01). Median timeliness (IQR) for MK 2016, 50% (39–57%) was also higher than in MK 2015, 19% (19–24%), and NM 2016 29% (24–36%) (p < 0.01). Kaplan-Meier Survival Analysis showed a significant progressive reduction in the time taken to transmit reports over the 15-week period (p < 0.01). Users ranked the app’s usability as greater than 4/5 on all dimensions. The total cost of the 15-week pilot project was US$40,575. It is estimated that to maintain the app in the 21 health facilities of MK will cost approximately US$18,800 in communication fees per year. CONCLUSIONS: The app-based data transmission system more than doubled the completeness and timeliness of disease surveillance reports. This simple, low-cost intervention may permit the early detection of disease outbreaks in similar low-resource settings elsewhere.","El-Khatib, Ziad; Shah, Maya; Zallappa, Samuel N; Nabeth, Pierre; Guerra, José; Manengu, Casimir T; Yao, Michel; Philibert, Aline; Massina, Lazare; Staiger, Claes-Philip; Mbailao, Raphael; Kouli, Jean-Pierre; Mboma, Hippolyte; Duc, Geraldine; Inagbe, Dago; Barry, Alpha Boubaca; Dumont, Thierry; Cavailler, Philippe; Quere, Michel; Willett, Brian; Reaiche, Souheil; de Ribaucourt, Hervé; Reeder, Bruce",Confl Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6199707/,101

5098,People’s perception and cost-effectiveness of home confinement during an influenza pandemic: evidence from the French case,2018-04-23,"Several papers in the literature employ agent-based modeling approach for providing reasonable solutions to dynamic optimization problems (DOPs). However, these studies employ a variety of agent-based modeling approaches with different strategies and features for different DOPs. On the other hand, there is an absence in the literature of a formal representation of the existing agent-based solution strategies. This paper proposes a representation scheme indicating how the solution strategies with agent-based approach can be summarized in a concise manner. We present these in a tabular form called “Agent Based Dynamic Optimization Problem Solution Strategy” (ABDOPSS). ABDOPSS distinguishes different classes of agent based algorithms (via communication type, cooperation type, dynamism domain and etc.) by specifying the fundamental ingredients of each of these approaches with respect to problem domain (problems with dynamic objective functions, constraints and etc.). This paper also analyzes 18 generic studies in the literature employing agent-based modeling based on ABDOPSS.","Baykasoglu, Adil; Durmusoglu, Zeynep D.

9304,Health Research and Surveillance Potential to Partner with 2-1-1,2012-11-14,"A cross-sectional study was carried out in a dairy goat herd, investigating the presence of rotavirus by means of ELISA, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and two latex agglutination tests in feces of 63 goat kids younger than 1 month, with and without diarrhea, and in feces of 19 adult goats during the first few days after parturition. All animals belonged to a herd located in the mountains of the León province (NW Spain). Rotaviruses were found in 18 out of 63 goat kid fecal samples but no significant association between shedding of rotavirus and presence of diarrhea could be established. Rotaviruses were found in kids aged 6 to 21 days, and more frequently between 6 and 10 days. No shedding of virus was detected in any of the adults. Considering ELISA as the reference test, PAGE and both latex agglutination tests were less sensitive. One of the latex tests was also highly non-specific. All PAGE-positive samples showed the typical electropherotype of group A rotavirus. Feces were also screened for other pathogens including Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens and Cryptosporidium parvum. C. parvum oocysts were detected in the feces of six out of 45 goat kids tested, all six suffering from diarrhea. This paper represents the first description of rotavirus infections in goats in Spain. The possible mechanisms of viral diffusion within the herd and its role as pathogen in goats are discussed.","Muñoz, M.; Lanza, I.; Alvarez, M.; Cármenes, P.",Small Rumin Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7135623/,101

This study aimed at identifying disease-causing variants in fifteen consanguineous Tunisian families. Full ophthalmic examination was performed. Index patients were subjected to IROme analysis or whole exome sequencing followed by homozygosity mapping. All detected variations were confirmed by direct Sanger sequencing. Mutation analysis in our patients revealed two compound heterozygous mutations p.(R91W);(V172D) in RPE65, and five novel homozygous mutations: p.R765C in CNGB1, p.H337R in PDE6B, splice site variant c.1129-2A > G and c.678_681delGAAG in FAM161A and c.1133 + 3_1133 + 6delAAGT in CERKL.

12995,The effect of copartisan justice ministers on human rights in presidential democracies,2020-09-02,"Wild birds are major natural reservoirs and potential dispersers of a variety of infectious diseases. As such, it is important to determine the diversity of viruses they carry and use this information to help understand the potential risks of spillover to humans, domestic animals, and other wildlife. We investigated the potential viral causes of paresis in long-standing, but undiagnosed, disease syndromes in wild Australian birds. RNA from diseased birds was extracted and pooled based on tissue type, host species, and clinical manifestation for metagenomic sequencing. Using a bulk and unbiased metatranscriptomic approach, combined with clinical investigation and histopathology, we identified a number of novel viruses from the families Astroviridae, Adenoviridae, Picornaviridae, Polyomaviridae, Paramyxoviridae, Parvoviridae, and Circoviridae in common urban wild birds, including Australian magpies, magpie larks, pied currawongs, Australian ravens, and rainbow lorikeets. In each case, the presence of the virus was confirmed by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. These data revealed a number of candidate viral pathogens that may contribute to coronary, skeletal muscle, vascular, and neuropathology in birds of the Corvidae and Artamidae families and neuropathology in members of the Psittaculidae. The existence of such a diverse virome in urban avian species highlights the importance and challenges in elucidating the etiology and ecology of wildlife pathogens in urban environments. This information will be increasingly important for managing disease risks and conducting surveillance for potential viral threats to wildlife, livestock, and human health. IMPORTANCE Wildlife naturally harbor a diverse array of infectious microorganisms and can be a source of novel diseases in domestic animals and human populations. Using unbiased RNA sequencing, we identified highly diverse viruses in native birds from Australian urban environments presenting with paresis. This research included the clinical investigation and description of poorly understood recurring syndromes of unknown etiology: clenched claw syndrome and black and white bird disease. As well as identifying a range of potentially disease-causing viral pathogens, this study describes methods that can effectively and efficiently characterize emergent disease syndromes in free-ranging wildlife and promotes further surveillance for specific pathogens of potential conservation and zoonotic concern.","Chang, Wei-Shan; Eden, John-Sebastian; Hall, Jane; Shi, Mang; Rose, Karrie; Holmes, Edward C.",J Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7459558/,101
13064,The burden of disease among Brazilian older adults and the challenge for health policies: results of the Global Burden of Disease Study 2017,2020-09-30,"Influenza virus poses a significant threat to public health, as exemplified by the recent introduction of the new pandemic strain H1N1/09 into human populations. Pandemics have been initiated by the occurrence of novel changes in animal sources that eventually adapt to human. One important issue in studies of viral genomes, particularly those of influenza virus, is to predict possible changes in genomic sequence that will become hazardous. We previously established a clustering method termed ‘BLSOM’ (batch-learning self-organizing map) that does not depend on sequence alignment and can characterize and compare even 1 million genomic sequences in one run. Strategies for comparing a vast number of genomic sequences simultaneously become increasingly important in genome studies because of remarkable progresses in nucleotide sequencing. In this study, we have constructed BLSOMs based on the oligonucleotide and codon composition of all influenza A viral strains available. Without prior information with regard to their hosts, sequences derived from strains isolated from avian or human sources were successfully clustered according to the hosts. Notably, the pandemic H1N1/09 strains have oligonucleotide and codon compositions that are clearly different from those of human seasonal influenza A strains. This enables us to infer future directional changes in the influenza A viral genome.","Iwasaki, Yuki; Abe, Takashi; Wada, Kennosuke; Itoh, Masae; Ikemura, Toshimichi",DNA Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3077041/,101

The basis of SARM1 inhibition and its activation under stress conditions are still unknown. Here, we present cryo-EM maps of SARM1 at 2.9 and 2.7 Å resolutions. These indicate that SARM1 homo-octamer avoids premature activation by assuming a packed conformation, with ordered inner and peripheral rings, that prevents dimerization and activation of the catalytic domains. This inactive conformation is stabilized by binding of SARM1’s own substrate NAD+ in an allosteric location, away from the catalytic sites. This model was validated by mutagenesis of the allosteric site, which led to constitutively active SARM1. We propose that the reduction of cellular NAD+ concentration contributes to the disassembly of SARM1's peripheral ring, which allows formation of active NADase domain dimers, thereby further depleting NAD+ to cause an energetic catastrophe and cell death.","Sporny, Michael; Guez-Haddad, Julia; Khazma, Tami; Yaron, Avraham; Dessau, Moshe; Shkolnisky, Yoel; Mim, Carsten; Isupov, Michail N; Zalk, Ran; Hons, Michael; Opatowsky, Yarden",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7688312/,101

Simple, evidence-based interventions such as temperature control could prevent approximately two-thirds of these deaths. However, key problems in implementing these interventions are a lack of newborn-trained healthcare workers and a lack of data collection systems. NeoTree is a digital platform aiming to improve newborn care in low-resource settings through real-time data capture and feedback alongside education and data linkage. This project demonstrates proof of concept of the NeoTree as a real-time data capture tool replacing handwritten clinical paper notes over a 9-month period in a tertiary neonatal unit at Harare Central Hospital, Zimbabwe. We aimed to deliver robust data for monthly mortality and morbidity meetings and to improve turnaround time for blood culture results among other quality improvement indicators. There were 3222 admissions and discharges entered using the NeoTree software with 41 junior doctors and 9 laboratory staff trained over the 9-month period. The NeoTree app was fully integrated into the department for all admission and discharge documentation and the monthly presentations became routine, informing local practice. An essential factor for this success was local buy-in and ownership at each stage of the project development, as was monthly data analysis and presentations allowing us to rapidly troubleshoot emerging issues.

It has been well observed that a large proportion of individuals with hyperuricemia have never had a gout flare(s), while some patients with gout can have a normuricemia. This raises a puzzle of the real role of serum uric acid (SUA) in the occurrence of gout flares. As the molecule of uric acid has its dual effects in vivo with antioxidant properties as well as being an inflammatory promoter, it has been placed in a delicate position in balancing metabolisms. Gout seems to be a multifactorial metabolic disease and its pathogenesis should not rely solely on hyperuricemia or monosodium urate (MSU) crystals.

17878,Vaccine safety: looking forward and back,2021-05-19,"Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) is a tick-borne emerging phlebovirus with high mortality rates of 6.0 to 30%. SFTSV infection is characterized by high fever, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, hemorrhage and multiple organ failures. Currently, specific therapies and vaccines remain elusive. Suitable small animal models are urgently needed to elucidate the pathogenesis and evaluate the potential drug and vaccine for SFTSV infection. Previous models presented only mild or no pathogenesis of SFTS, limiting their applications in SFTSV infection. Therefore, it is an urgent need to develop a small animal model for the investigation of SFTSV pathogenesis and evaluation of therapeutics. In the current report, we developed a SFTSV infection model based on the HuPBL-NCG mice that recapitulates many pathological characteristics of SFTSV infection in humans. Virus-induced histopathological changes were identified in spleen, lung, kidney, and liver. SFTSV was colocalized with macrophages in the spleen and liver, suggesting that the macrophages in the spleen and liver could be the principle target cells of SFTSV. In addition, histological analysis showed that the vascular endothelium integrity was severely disrupted upon viral infection along with depletion of platelets. In vitro cellular assays further revealed that SFTSV infection increased the vascular permeability of endothelial cells by promoting tyrosine phosphorylation and internalization of the adhesion molecule vascular endothelial (VE)–cadherin, a critical component of endothelial integrity. In addition, we found that both virus infection and pathogen-induced exuberant cytokine release dramatically contributed to the vascular endothelial injury. We elucidated the pathogenic mechanisms of hemorrhage syndrome and developed a humanized mouse model for SFTSV infection, which should be helpful for anti-SFTSV therapy and pathogenesis study.","Xu, Shijie; Jiang, Na; Nawaz, Waqas; Liu, Bingxin; Zhang, Fang; Liu, Ye; Wu, Xilin; Wu, Zhiwei",PLoS Pathog,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8139491/,101

18142,One Health approach for elimination of human anthrax in a tribal district of Odisha: Study protocol,2021-05-27,"BACKGROUND: Integrated care enhanced with information technology has emerged as a means to transform health services to meet the long-term care needs of patients with chronic diseases. However, the feasibility of applying integrated care to the emerging “three-manager” mode in China remains to be explored. Moreover, few studies have attempted to integrate multiple types of chronic diseases into a single system. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop a coordinated telehealth system that addresses the existing challenges of the “three-manager” mode in China while supporting the management of single or multiple chronic diseases. METHODS: The system was designed based on a tailored integrated care model. The model was constructed at the individual scale, mainly focusing on specifying the involved roles and responsibilities through a universal care pathway. A custom ontology was developed to represent the knowledge contained in the model. The system consists of a service engine for data storage and decision support, as well as different forms of clients for care providers and patients. Currently, the system supports management of three single chronic diseases (hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) and one type of multiple chronic conditions (hypertension with type 2 diabetes mellitus). A retrospective study was performed based on the long-term observational data extracted from the database to evaluate system usability, treatment effect, and quality of care. RESULTS: The retrospective analysis involved 6964 patients with chronic diseases and 249 care providers who have registered in our system since its deployment in 2015. A total of 519,598 self-monitoring records have been submitted by the patients. The engine could generate different types of records regularly based on the specific care pathway. Results of the comparison tests and causal inference showed that a part of patient outcomes improved after receiving management through the system, especially the systolic blood pressure of patients with hypertension (P<.001 in all comparison tests and an approximately 5 mmHg decrease after intervention via causal inference). A regional case study showed that the work efficiency of care providers differed among individuals. CONCLUSIONS: Our system has potential to provide effective management support for single or multiple chronic conditions simultaneously. The tailored closed-loop care pathway was feasible and effective under the “three-manager” mode in China. One direction for future work is to introduce advanced artificial intelligence techniques to construct a more personalized care pathway.","Wang, Zheyu; An, Jiye; Lin, Hui; Zhou, Jiaqiang; Liu, Fang; Chen, Juan; Duan, Huilong; Deng, Ning",JMIR Med Inform,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8167615/,101
18293,Informing the response to COVID-19 in Spain: priorities for mental health research,2021-06-11,"Concussion is a global health concern. Despite its high prevalence, a sound understanding of the mechanisms underlying this type of diffuse brain injury remains elusive. It is, however, well established that concussions cause significant functional deficits; that children and youths are disproportionately affected and have longer recovery time than adults; and that individuals suffering from a concussion are more prone to experience additional concussions, with each successive injury increasing the risk of long term neurological and mental health complications. Currently, the most significant challenge in concussion management is the lack of objective, clinically- accepted, brain-based approaches for determining whether an athlete has suffered a concussion. Here, we report on our efforts to address this challenge. Specifically, we introduce a deep learning long short-term memory (LSTM)-based recurrent neural network that is able to distinguish between non-concussed and acute post-concussed adolescent athletes using only short (i.e. 90 s long) samples of resting state EEG data as input. The athletes were neither required to perform a specific task nor expected to respond to a stimulus during data collection. The acquired EEG data were neither filtered, cleaned of artefacts, nor subjected to explicit feature extraction. The LSTM network was trained and validated using data from 27 male, adolescent athletes with sports related concussion, benchmarked against 35 non-concussed adolescent athletes. During rigorous testing, the classifier consistently identified concussions with an accuracy of > 90% and achieved an ensemble median Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC/AUC) equal to 0.971. This is the first instance of a high-performing classifier that relies only on easy-to-acquire resting state, raw EEG data.

Owing to the limitation of drug resistance, herein we synthesized thio-, chloro-, and hydroxyl-functionalized various imidazoquinolines by molecular hybridization approach. All the imidazoquinoline derivatives were examined for their antibacterial activity against selected bacterial pathogens by the agar well diffusion method. In addition, the anti-oxidant efficacy of imidazoquinolines was also tested using ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP). Among them, electron-withdrawing (-Cl) substituent containing imidazoquinoline 5f showed higher antibacterial and anti-oxidant activities than other imidazoquinolines and reached the effectiveness of the standard. In addition, compounds 4f, 5e, and 3f showed moderate antibacterial activity and other derivatives displayed weak activity against various pathogens. Molecular docking studies were also performed on selected imidazoquinoline derivatives (3f, 4f, and 5f), which showed high docking score and strong binding energy values. These results revealed that thio-imidazoquinoline could assist as a prototype for the designing of multidrug-resistant antibiotics against various microbial organisms.","Velmurugan, K.; Don, Derin; Kannan, Rajesh; Selvaraj, C.; VishnuPriya, S.; Selvaraj, G.; Singh, S.K.; Nandhakumar, R.",Heliyon,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8273425/,101

20217,AFYA BORA CONSORTIUM FELLOWSHIP: a journey of success in Global Health Leadership Training,2021-05-11,"BACKGROUND: Although therapeutic hypothermia reduces death or disability after neonatal encephalopathy in high-income countries, its safety and efficacy in low-income and middle-income countries is unclear. We aimed to examine whether therapeutic hypothermia alongside optimal supportive intensive care reduces death or moderate or severe disability after neonatal encephalopathy in south Asia. METHODS: We did a multicountry open-label, randomised controlled trial in seven tertiary neonatal intensive care units in India, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh. We enrolled infants born at or after 36 weeks of gestation with moderate or severe neonatal encephalopathy and a need for continued resuscitation at 5 min of age or an Apgar score of less than 6 at 5 min of age (for babies born in a hospital), or both, or an absence of crying by 5 min of age (for babies born at home). Using a web-based randomisation system, we allocated infants into a group receiving whole body hypothermia (33·5°C) for 72 h using a servo-controlled cooling device, or to usual care (control group), within 6 h of birth. All recruiting sites had facilities for invasive ventilation, cardiovascular support, and access to 3 Tesla MRI scanners and spectroscopy. Masking of the intervention was not possible, but those involved in the magnetic resonance biomarker analysis and neurodevelopmental outcome assessments were masked to the allocation. The primary outcome was a combined endpoint of death or moderate or severe disability at 18–22 months, assessed by the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development (third edition) and a detailed neurological examination. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02387385. FINDINGS: We screened 2296 infants between Aug 15, 2015, and Feb 15, 2019, of whom 576 infants were eligible for inclusion. After exclusions, we recruited 408 eligible infants and we assigned 202 to the hypothermia group and 206 to the control group. Primary outcome data were available for 195 (97%) of the 202 infants in the hypothermia group and 199 (97%) of the 206 control group infants. 98 (50%) infants in the hypothermia group and 94 (47%) infants in the control group died or had a moderate or severe disability (risk ratio 1·06; 95% CI 0·87–1·30; p=0·55). 84 infants (42%) in the hypothermia group and 63 (31%; p=0·022) infants in the control group died, of whom 72 (36%) and 49 (24%; p=0·0087) died during neonatal hospitalisation. Five serious adverse events were reported: three in the hypothermia group (one hospital readmission relating to pneumonia, one septic arthritis, and one suspected venous thrombosis), and two in the control group (one related to desaturations during MRI and other because of endotracheal tube displacement during transport for MRI). No adverse events were considered causally related to the study intervention. INTERPRETATION: Therapeutic hypothermia did not reduce the combined outcome of death or disability at 18 months after neonatal encephalopathy in low-income and middle-income countries, but significantly increased death alone. Therapeutic hypothermia should not be offered as treatment for neonatal encephalopathy in low-income and middle-income countries, even when tertiary neonatal intensive care facilities are available.

There is a desire to cough and the patient expectorates nothing worth mentioning.” He also described an open drainage procedure: “When the fifteenth day after rupture has appeared, prepare a warm bath, set him upon a stool, which is not wobbly, someone should hold his hands, then shake him by the shoulders and listen to see on which side a noise is heard. And right at this place, preferably on the left, make an incision, then it produces death more rarely.”1,2 Beyond providing less-wobbly stools, few advances were made for more than 2000 years that allowed surgeons to routinely enter the pleural cavity, the fear being a potentially fatal pneumothorax. With the advent of positive pressure ventilation in the early 1900s, pneumothorax was no longer a prohibitive risk, and the era of surgical intervention in the pleural cavity had begun.3","Friedberg, Joseph S.; Kucharczuk, John C.",Surgery,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120517/,101

VLPs structurally resemble their native source virus, maintaining immunological relevance by retaining formation of immunogenic motifs with natural conformation. The absence of the virus genome renders VLPs safe for administration as a subunit vaccine. VLPs can target both arms of the immune response, with some VLPs initiating production of specific antibodies and others activating cytotoxic T cells. VLPs are also exceptionally versatile, conferring protection against the host virus or acting as a scaffold for antigenic molecules. In addition, VLP can support intraparticulate encapsulation for immunomodulation and gene delivery. VLP vaccines have been developed for prophylactic protection against infectious organisms, and therapeutic treatment of conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease, hypertension, and cancer. With an expanding list of vaccine candidates, VLP vaccines are a promising field with a wide range of applications.","Donaldson, Braeden; Al-Barwani, Farah; Young, Vivienne; Scullion, Sarah; Ward, Vernon; Young, Sarah",Subunit Vaccine Delivery,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121566/,101

Firstly, all possible maximum successive complementary base pairs would be identified and maintained. Secondary, the new neighboring state could be generated by choosing one of these successive base pairs randomly. Thirdly, the annealing schedule is selected to systematically decrease the temperature as the algorithm proceeds, the final solution is the structure with minimum free energy. Furthermore, the performance of our algorithm is evaluated by the instances from PseudoBase database, and compared with state-of-the-art algorithms.

To address this challenge, we propose a novel semi-supervised approach to learn sentiment-aware representations from easily accessible unlabeled data specifically for the fine-grained sentiment learning. This is very different from current popular semi-supervised solutions that use the unlabeled data via pretraining to generate generic representations for various types of downstream tasks. Particularly, we show for the first time that we can learn and detect some highly sentiment-discriminative neural units from the unsupervised pretrained model, termed neural sentiment units. Due to the discriminability, these sentiment units can be leveraged by downstream LSTM-based classifiers to generate sentiment-aware and context-dependent word representations to substantially improve their sentiment classification performance. Extensive empirical results on two benchmark datasets show that our approach (i) substantially outperforms state-of-the-art sentiment classifiers and (ii) achieves significantly better data efficiency.","Zhao, Jingjing; Yang, Yao; Pang, Guansong; Lv, Lei; Shang, Hong; Sun, Zhongqian; Yang, Wei",Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206307/,101

In this paper we are concerned with Timed Automata for the specification of timed behaviour of Continuous Time Markov Chains (CTMC), as used in the stochastic temporal logic CSL[Formula: see text]. A timed path formula of CSL[Formula: see text] is specified by a Deterministic Timed Automaton (DTA) that features two kinds of transitions: synchronizing transitions (triggered by CTMC transitions) and autonomous transitions (triggered when a clock reaches a given threshold). Other definitions of CSL[Formula: see text] are based on DTAs that do not include autonomous transitions. This raises the natural question: do autonomous transitions enhance expressiveness and/or conciseness of DTAs? We prove that this is the case and we provide a syntactical characterization of DTAs for which autonomous transitions do not add expressive power, but allow one to define exponentially more concise DTAs.","Donatelli, Susanna; Haddad, Serge",Language and Automata Theory and Applications,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206655/,101

The goal of this tutorial is to disseminate skills in structure-based drug design and to allow others to unleash their own creativity to design new drugs to fight the current pandemic. The tutorial begins with the X-ray crystallographic structure of the main protease (Mpro) of the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) bound to a peptide substrate and then uses the UCSF Chimera software to modify the substrate to create a cyclic peptide inhibitor within the Mpro active site. Finally, the tutorial uses the molecular docking software AutoDock Vina to show the interaction of the cyclic peptide inhibitor with both SARS-CoV Mpro and the highly homologous SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. The supporting information (supplementary material) provides an illustrated step-by-step guide for the inhibitor design, to help readers design their own drug candidates for COVID-19 and the coronaviruses that will cause future pandemics.

CAB+RPV LA is a novel, long-acting antiretroviral therapy (ART) currently in development and is administered intramuscularly monthly or every 2 months by a healthcare provider. COVID-19 and the resultant restrictions on access to some clinical trial sites presents challenges to the continuous delivery (‘implementation fidelity’) of CAB+RPV LA during a pandemic. METHODS: Descriptive analyses were conducted using aggregated data from ongoing CAB+RPV LA clinical trials (LATTE-2, ATLAS, ATLAS-2M, FLAIR, POLAR, and CUSTOMIZE) to evaluate impact of COVID-19 on LA dosing. Data through 15 July 2020 were aggregated, categorized, and summarized to show trends. Data collection is continuously ongoing. RESULTS: As of 15 July 2020, 1831 participants are currently on CAB+RPV LA across these clinical studies. As of 15 July, 113 (6%) participants had injection visits that were impacted by COVID-19. LA dosing was interrupted in 51 (45%) participants due to clinic closure or staffing constraints, 9 (8%) for self-quarantine, 11 (10%) for confirmed or suspected COVID-19, and 42 (37%) for other reasons. Among participants impacted, 64 (58%) were from N. America, 29 (26%) Europe, 14 (13%) S. Africa, and 3 (3%) Latin America. Majority of participants were male (87, 79%), white (74, 65%), with median age 35 years. Mitigation strategies included short-term oral therapy with CAB+RPV (78, 69%), short-term standard of care ART (28, 25%), and rescheduling of LA injections (6, 5%). Although some are still receiving oral therapy, current median duration of oral therapy has been 45 days. To date, 65 (58%) have restarted LA and viral load data collection is ongoing. No suspected or confirmed virologic failure was observed for any participant impacted by COVID-19 to date. CONCLUSION: In the midst of the global pandemic, no treatment interruptions were seen across the ongoing CAB+RPV LA clinical studies. Missed visits were manageable and successfully mitigated, primarily by temporary transition to oral therapy with no resultant virologic failure or emerging resistance through 15 July 2020. CAB+RPV LA is a new HIV-1 treatment modality that has demonstrated implementation fidelity across clinical studies during the current COVID-19 pandemic.

However, since companion animals cannot communicate with language, measures for diseases or pain that cannot be seen with the naked eye are inevitably insufficient. Among them, bone and joint disease affects the movement of companion animals, and better treatment is possible if the joint disease can be detected in advance in the stage before it worsens. In this paper, we intend to design a smartphone app based on 5G communication that can diagnose the presence and possibility of bone joint disease in companion animals. The Smarteck app takes photos of the back, side, and front of the dog on a smartphone connected via 5G mobile communication and uses the photographed photos and videos to have joint abnormalities such as patellar dislocation, hip dislocation, and cruciate ligament rupture. It will be designed to analyze and judge the presence of joint abnormalities through artificial intelligence (AI) machine learning.

The results indicate that the personality traits do not directly influence sustainable social responsibility, although the traits (except extroversion) influence bricolage. Moreover, we found that open, conscious, and agreeable personalities indirectly contribute to sustainable social responsibility, with bricolage as a mediator. Our findings encourage enterprises to focus on those personality traits during crises (especially COVID‐19) that empower people to effectively manage existing resources (e.g., bricolage) and protect their stakeholders. Family‐owned SMEs need to assign resource utilization tasks to family members having personalities of openness, conscientiousness, and neuroticism because these kinds of people have high capacities for bricolage.","Anwar, Muhammad; Clauß, Thomas",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8014499/,101

Evidence on the Lack of Equitable and Sustainable Well-Being,2021-06-26,"This study compares the level of digital competence of Spanish higher education teachers in the use of three types of ICT resources in the classroom: digital tools to consume information, digital tools to produce information, and emerging technologies. To measure the level of competence, the validated DigCompEdu Check-In instrument with an ex post facto design is used. The sample consists of 2180 university teachers from Andalusia (Spain) working in different areas of knowledge: Arts and Humanities, Sciences, Health Sciences, Engineering and Architecture, Social and Legal Sciences; and classified into three levels of teaching experience: between 0–5 years, 6–14 years, and 15 years or more. The results show that teachers with 15 or more years of experience represent the group with the most significant differences in regard to their level of digital competence when comparing the use of the three types of ICT resources; furthermore, the results were similar for all areas of knowledge. In addition, the visualization or creation of videos, as well as the visualization or creation of posters and concept maps, are the resources that were found to be most significant for the three levels of experience. For each specific area, it is recommended that each of their results is analysed in detail. Finally, further research is recommended to validate these preliminary findings in each of the knowledge areas.","Guillén-Gámez, Francisco.

55275,Bounded Justice and the Limits of Health Equity,2021,"INTRODUCTION: The COVID‐19 pandemic forced many schools to adopt more online teaching than they would normally have chosen for 2020. While many medical schools canceled laboratory teaching sessions in the anatomical sciences, a minority maintained laboratory teaching, including ours. Due to the pandemic, students had far fewer opportunities to interact with their peers and faculty, and students may have experienced greater non‐academic stress, all of which would be expected to negatively impact student academic performance. Also, some faculty members feel that virtual vs. in‐person lectures hinder student learning. Taken together, these issues led to significant concern about lower academic performance by first‐year medical students in 2020. Our curriculum changed very little between 2019 and 2020, presenting the opportunity to assess the impact of online lectures while keeping the laboratory component essentially unchanged. We hypothesized that maintaining laboratory‐based teaching minimized the negative effects of online lectures and student stress in 2020. METHODS: Academic performance in the anatomical sciences between 2019 (98 students) and 2020 (143 students) was compared using scores from five written and five laboratory exams from Medical Gross Anatomy (MGA) and four histology laboratory exams from the Foundations of Medicine I course (FOM‐I). In addition, course evaluation data for the two courses between 2019 and 2020 was compared. RESULTS: The exam scores between 2019 and 2020 differed significantly overall (one‐way PERMANOVA for non‐parametric data, p = 0.003, 9999 permutations). In pairwise comparisons of specific exams between the two years, students in 2020 performed significantly better on one gross anatomy written exam, one gross anatomy laboratory exam, and one histology laboratory exam, whereas 2019 students performed significantly better on one histology laboratory exam (Mann‐Whitney U tests, dfs = 239, p‐values = 0.02 or less). The mean scores from student course evaluations for both MGA and FOM‐I were slightly higher in 2020 compared to 2019, although the differences were not statistically significant (Independent Sample t‐tests, dfs = 213, p = 0.23, 0.13, respectively). DISCUSSION: These results indicate that the change to all‐online lectures with standard in‐person laboratory sessions in 2020 did not harm student academic performance in the anatomical sciences. The one lower exam score in histology in 2020 may be due to two additional topics being included on that exam in 2020. If the likely extra‐academic stressors that some students may have experienced due to the pandemic (whether from social isolation or direct impact of the disease on family, friends, or themselves) are factored in, the similarity in academic performance in 2019 and 2020 suggests that online lectures paired with in‐person laboratory learning may in fact be beneficial for student academic performance, although this would need further investigation. This study will enable comparisons with medical schools that had entirely virtual courses, with either virtual or no laboratory sessions. This study of human subjects was approved by the Texas A&M University Institutional Review Board.","Brakora, Katherine; Day, Leslie; Chico, Diane",FASEB J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8239821/,101

It relies on clinical material and on popular culture. The purpose is twofold. First, to exemplify the unique contribution of psychoanalysis for decoding both the political narrative and its reception thus helping understand and better address societal challenges. Second, to inform the debate in the political sciences as to what is a good crisis management strategy. The main argument is that an effective communication, in general, but especially in emergency situations, needs to allow for the unconscious responses to both the danger itself and to the measures imposed to deal with it. Failure to consider this unconscious dimension impacts on the effectiveness of the policy.","Giorgi, Liana",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8239930/,101
55311,The chunampet community health information management system: A health and demographic surveillance system from a rural South India,2021-05-31,"The COVID‐19 pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV2), has resulted in a significant loss of human life due in part to the paucity of therapeutic options for treatment of the disease. The Spike glycoprotein is responsible for the attachment and infection of host cell and as such it is the target of many countermeasures including vaccines. Most of these therapeutics focus only on the ectodomain of the protein leaving the cytosolic domain of the Spike protein largely unexplored. Our study focuses on the cytosolic domain of the Spike protein as it conserved amongst coronaviruses. This domain contains numerous highly conserved cysteine (cys) residues that are potential sites of S‐palmitoylation; a post‐translational modification mediated by the host enzymes (palmitoyltransferases) that add palmitate to the target protein. In other coronaviruses, palmitoylation of the cytosolic domain of the Spike protein is required for its partitioning into de novo synthesized viral progeny. Here we investigated the cytosolic domain of Spike and its interaction with the protein palmitoyltransferase ZDHHC5. We have found that the Spike protein is palmitoylated on multiple juxtamembrane cysteine residues. Additionally, increased abundance of ZDHHC5 resulted in hyper‐palmitoylation of Spike while silencing of ZDHHC5 reduced palmitoylation as well as the ability of the human coronavirus 229E to form viral plaques in cell monolayers. We used a fatty acid synthase inhibitor TVB‐3166 to reduce palmitoyl‐CoA levels which in turn eliminated palmitoylation of SARS‐CoV2 Spike. Treating cells with TVB‐3166 attenuates the ability of human coronavirus 229E to form plaques and promoted the survival of mice from a lethal murine coronavirus infection. Thus, inhibition of the Spike protein palmitoylation has the potential to treat SARS‐CoV‐2 and other coronavirus infections.","Mekhail, Katrina",FASEB J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8239932/,101

Austin State University (SFASU), located in Nacogdoches, TX, transitioned face‐to‐face classes to online instruction because of the COVID‐19 pandemic. The east Texas region suffers from some of the poorest internet availability in the nation. Thus, limitations exist for streaming lectures or having students download large files. Podcasts are small audio files that can be downloaded from the internet for learning. Research has shown that the use of lecture podcasts have a variety of benefits for both faculty and students. Lecture podcasts provide students small file sizes to download and access and allow them to engage with the course material asynchronously. Therefore, the decision was made to record lecture podcasts for Cultivating Plants, Plant Propagation, and Plant Breeding to deliver educational content for the class. An end of semester survey conducted by the SFASU Agriculture Department indicated that 59% of students who engaged with this type of learning felt it was extremely effective. Additional student comments and semester reflections also provided feedback. This example provides further evidence that lecture podcasts can be a useful tool for educators in an ever‐changing world.","Barnes, Jared; Carraway, Candis; Jones, Stephanie",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8420560/,101

These parasites cause significant economic losses to the poultry industry, predominantly due to compromised efficiency of production as well as the cost of control. These losses were recently estimated to cost chicken producers approximately £10.4 billion worldwide annually. High levels of Eimeria infection cause clinical coccidiosis which is a significant threat to poultry welfare, and a pre-disposing contributory factor for necrotic enteritis. Control of Eimeria parasites and coccidiosis is therefore an important endeavour; multiple approaches have been developed and these are often deployed together. This review summarises current trends in strategies for control of Eimeria, focusing on three main areas: good husbandry, chemoprophylaxis and vaccination. There is currently no “perfect solution” and there are advantages and limitations to all existing methods. Therefore, the aim of this review is to present current control strategies and suggest how these may develop in the future.","Attree, Elizabeth; Sanchez-Arsuaga, Gonzalo; Jones, Michelle; Xia, Dong; Marugan-Hernandez, Virginia; Blake, Damer; Tomley, Fiona",CABI Agric Biosci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8475900/,101

METHODS This is a retrospective study conducted in a pediatric HSCT unit in Curitiba, Brazil between February 2013 and December 2017 that evaluated 109 pediatric patients. The variables analyzed were: age, gender, baseline disease, type of transplantation, infection topography, etiologic agent, time of HAI occurrence, antimicrobial prophylaxis, period of neutropenia, length of stay, and outcomes. RESULTS Out of 113 HSCT procedures, 91 (83.5%) were allogenic and 18 autologous (16.5%). The mean age of the patients was 7.9 years, with an median of 8.1 years (4.0 months-17.3 years); 71 (65.1%) were male; 55 (50.5%) presented with an oncologic diagnosis, 32 (29.4%) with a hematological diagnosis, 17 (15.6%) with immunodeficiencies, and 5 (4.6%) with other causes. During hospitalization after HSCT, 86 episodes of HAI were detected in 66 patients, with an infection density of 16.5 infections/1000 patient days, 86% of which occurred after allogeneic transplants, appearing, on average, 15.3 days after transplantation. The main topographies were bloodstream infection (BSI), with 24 (27.9%) cases, and central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI), with 11 (12.8%). Gram-positive bacteria predominated in cultures and HAI was more frequent in patients diagnosed with immunodeficiencies and other non-oncologic and non-hematologic conditions. Among the Gram-positive bacteria, Staphylococcus epidermidis was the main agent identified (77.7%), possibly due to colonization. However, Gram-negative bacteria, with a resistance profile, comprised 40% of the cases of bacterial infections, most of them represented by Klebsiella pneumoniae (66.6%). Out of the 66 patients who presented HAI, 59 patients (89.4%) were discharged and 7 (10.6%) died. CONCLUSION The main topographies were CLABSI and BSI. Patients with immunodeficiencies presented a higher risk for HAI. Staphylococcus epidermidis was the main agent identified. However, Klebsiella pneumoniae posed a higher risk for Pediatric Intensive Care Unit admission and death.","Amancio, Luana; Garcia Giamberardino, Heloisa Ihle; Ferreira, Eurípedes; Matucheski, Biana; Luisa Garcia Giamberardino, Ana",Transplant infectious disease : an official journal of the Transplantation Society,https://doi.org/10.1111/tid.13532; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33249699/,101

However, the effect of ezetimibe on the progression of atherosclerosis remains unknown. METHODS We conducted a double-blind, randomized, 24-month trial comparing the effects of daily therapy with 80 mg of simvastatin either with placebo or with 10 mg of ezetimibe in 720 patients with familial hypercholesterolemia. Patients underwent B-mode ultrasonography to assess the intima-media thickness of the walls of the carotid and femoral arteries. The primary outcome measure was the change in the mean carotid-artery intima-media thickness, which was defined as the average of the means of the far-wall intima-media thickness of the right and left common carotid arteries, carotid bulbs, and internal carotid arteries. RESULTS The primary outcome, the mean (+/-SE) change in the carotid-artery intima-media thickness, was 0.0058+/-0.0037 mm in the simvastatin-only group and 0.0111+/-0.0038 mm in the simvastatin-plus-ezetimibe (combined-therapy) group (P=0.29). Secondary outcomes (consisting of other variables regarding the intima-media thickness of the carotid and femoral arteries) did not differ significantly between the two groups. At the end of the study, the mean (+/-SD) LDL cholesterol level was 192.7+/-60.3 mg per deciliter (4.98+/-1.56 mmol per liter) in the simvastatin group and 141.3+/-52.6 mg per deciliter (3.65+/-1.36 mmol per liter) in the combined-therapy group (a between-group difference of 16.5%, P<0.01). The differences between the two groups in reductions in levels of triglycerides and C-reactive protein were 6.6% and 25.7%, respectively, with greater reductions in the combined-therapy group (P<0.01 for both comparisons). Side-effect and safety profiles were similar in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS In patients with familial hypercholesterolemia, combined therapy with ezetimibe and simvastatin did not result in a significant difference in changes in intima-media thickness, as compared with simvastatin alone, despite decreases in levels of LDL cholesterol and C-reactive protein.

AIMS This study sought to investigate patterns and predictors of DSM-5 PTSD in a treatment-seeking sample of African refugees. METHODS Participants were 122 African refugees and asylum-seekers living in Italy who completed measures of trauma exposure and PTSD symptoms. Latent class analysis (LCA) was used to identify PTSD symptom profiles, and predictors of class membership were identified via multinomial logistic regression. RESULTS Among participants, 79.5% had a probable diagnosis of PTSD. Three PTSD classes were identified by LCA: Pervasive (32.0%) with high probabilities of all symptoms, high-Threat (45.9%) with higher probabilities of intrusions and avoidance symptoms, moderate-Avoidance (22.1%) with high probability of thoughts/feelings avoidance. None of the examined variables (legal status, gender, age, education, months spent in Italy, number of traumatic events, employment) significantly predicted class membership with the relevant exception of reception conditions. Specifically, living in large reception centres (over 1,000 people) significantly predicted Pervasive PTSD class membership compared to high/Threat PTSD class and to moderate/Avoidance class. CONCLUSION This study provides evidence for distinct patterns of PTSD symptomatology in refugees and asylum seekers. We identified three classes which present both qualitative and quantitative differences in symptoms: Pervasive class, high-Threat class and a new moderate class, characterised by avoidance symptoms. Reception conditions contributed to the emergence of the Pervasive PTSD profile characterised by the symptoms highest severity. These findings highlight that stressors in the post-migration environment, as inadequate reception conditions in large facilities, may have detrimental effect on refugees' mental health. We emphasise the importance for host countries to implement reception models that provide effective protection and integration to this vulnerable population.","Barbieri, Alberto; Visco-Comandini, Federica; Alunni Fegatelli, Danilo; Dessì, Anna; Cannella, Giuseppe; Stellacci, Antonella; Pirchio, Sabine",The International journal of social psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1177/0020764020959095; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32962504/,101

Conclusion This retrospective study shows that a lower rScO2 and hemoglobin concentration are correlated with AKI after CABG in patients with no peripheral vascular disease or recent myocardial infarction. We suggest that cerebral oximetry alone may predict postoperative AKI well.","Balci, Canan; Haftaci, Engin; Kunt, Atike Tekeli",The Journal of international medical research,https://doi.org/10.1177/0300060517741064; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29210291/,101

70405,The Effects of Covid-19 Pandemic on Syrian Refugees in Turkey: The Case of Kilis.,2020-09-01,"Nephroblastoma is the most common kidney tumour in children. Its diagnosis is based on imagery. In the SAIAD project, we have designed a platform for optimizing the segmentation of deformed kidney and tumour with a small dataset, using Artificial Intelligence methods. These patient's structures segmented by separate tools and processes must then be fused to obtain a unique numerical 3D representation. However, when aggregating these structures into a final segmentation, conflicting pixels may appear. These conflicts can be solved by IA techniques. This paper presents a synthesis of our segmentation contribution in the SAIAD project and a new fusion method. The segmentation method uses the FCN-8s network with the OV2ASSION training method, which allows segmentation by patient and overcomes the limited dataset. This new fusion method combines the segmentations of the previously performed structures, using a simple and efficient network combined with the OV2ASSION training method as well, in order to manage eventual conflicting pixels. These segmentation and fusion methods were evaluated on pathological kidney and tumour structures of 14 patients affected by nephroblastoma, included in the final dataset of the SAIAD project. They are compared with other methods adapted from the literature. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our training method coupled with the FCN-8s network in the segmentation process with more patients, and in the case of the fusion process, its effectiveness coupled with a common network, in resolving the conflicting pixels and its ability to improve the resulting segmentations.","Corbat, Lisa; Henriet, Julien; Chaussy, Yann; Lapayre, Jean-Christophe",Computers in biology and medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiomed.2020.103928; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32818740/,101

The technology has been used to support a wide variety of mechanical support modalities and diseases, including respiratory failure, cardiorespiratory failure, and cardiac failure. Over many decades and safety and efficacy studies, followed by randomized clinical trials and thousands of clinical uses, ECLS is considered as an accepted treatment option for severe pulmonary and selected cardiovascular failure. Extracorporeal life support involves the use of support artificial organs, including a membrane lung and blood pump. Over time, changes in the technology and the management of ECLS support devices have evolved. This manuscript describes the use of membrane lungs and blood pumps used during ECLS support from 2002 to 2017 in over 65,000 patients reported to the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization Registry. Device longevity and complications associated with membrane lungs and blood pump are described and stratified by age group: neonates, pediatrics, and adults.","Hayes, McKenzie M; Fallon, Brian P; Barbaro, Ryan P; Manusko, Niki; Bartlett, Robert H; Toomasian, John M",ASAIO journal,https://doi.org/10.1097/mat.0000000000001368; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33528156/,101
71300,COVID-19 Death Rates Are Higher in Rural Counties With Larger Shares of Blacks and Hispanics.,2020-09-07,"INTRODUCTION In non-elderly adults, aortic valve replacement (AVR) with conventional prostheses yield poor long-term outcomes. Recent publications suggest a benefit of the Ross procedure over conventional AVR and highlight the need for high-quality randomised controlled trial (RCTs) on the optimal AVR. We have initiated a pilot trial assess two feasibility criteria and one assumption: (1) evaluate the capacity to enrol six patients per centre per year in at least five international centre, (2) validate greater than 90% compliance with allocation and (3) to validate the proportion of mechanical (≥65%) vs biological (≤35%) valves in the conventional arm. METHODS AND ANALYSIS Ross for Valve replacement In AduLts (REVIVAL) is a multinational, expertise-based RCT in adults aged 18-60 years undergoing AVR, comparing the Ross procedure versus one of the alternative approaches (mechanical vs stented or stentless bioprosthesis). The feasibility objectives will be assessed after randomising 60 patients; we will then make a decision regarding whether to expand the trial with the current protocol. We will ultimately examine the impact of the Ross procedure as compared with conventional AVR in non-elderly adults on survival free of valve-related life-threatening complications (major bleeding, systemic thromboembolism, valve thrombosis and valve reoperation) over the duration of follow-up. The objectives of the pilot trial will be analysed using descriptive statistics. In the full trial, the intention-to-treat principle will guide all primary analyses. A time-to-event analysis will be performed and Kaplan-Meier survival curves with comparison between groups using a log rank test will be presented. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION REVIVAL will answer whether non-elderly adults benefit from the Ross procedure over conventional valve replacement.

71590,Considering grief in mental health outcomes of COVID-19.,2020-06-01,"Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy is an effective treatment option for patients with well-differentiated somatostatin receptor-expressing neuroendocrine tumors. However, published data result mainly from retrospective monocentric studies. We initiated a multi-institutional, prospective, board-reviewed registry for patients treated with peptide receptor radionuclide therapy in Germany in 2009. In five centers, 297 patients were registered. Primary tumors were mainly derived from pancreas (117/297) and small intestine (80/297), whereas 56 were of unknown primary. Most tumors were well differentiated with median Ki67 proliferation rate of 5% (range 0.9-70%). Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy was performed using mainly yttrium-90 and/or lutetium-177 as radionuclides in 1-8 cycles. Mean overall survival was estimated at 213 months with follow-up between 1 and 230 months after initial diagnosis, and 87 months with follow-up between 1 and 92 months after start of peptide receptor radionuclide therapy. Median overall survival was not yet reached. Subgroup analysis demonstrated that best results were obtained in neuroendocrine tumors with proliferation rate below 20%. Our results indicate that peptide receptor radionuclide therapy is an effective treatment for well- and moderately differentiated neuroendocrine tumors irrespective of previous therapies and should be regarded as one of the primary treatment options for patients with somatostatin receptor-expressing neuroendocrine tumors.","Hörsch, Dieter; Ezziddin, Samer; Haug, Alexander; Gratz, Klaus Friedrich; Dunkelmann, Simone; Krause, Bernd Joachim; Schümichen, Carl; Bengel, Frank M; Knapp, Wolfram H; Bartenstein, Peter; Biersack, Hans-Jürgen; Plöckinger, Ursula; Schwartz-Fuchs, Sabine; Baum, R P",Recent results in cancer research.

73568,Rural-urban mental health disparities in the United States during COVID-19.,2020-06-01,"INTRODUCTION Migraine is the most common neurological disorder and one of the major causes of years lived with disability. Its treatment (especially of chronic forms) is often challenging and accompanied with adverse effects. Although new therapeutic approaches have recently emerged (eg, calcitonin gene-related peptide antibodies), these are linked to strict prescribing guidelines and therefore limited to only a minority of patients. Recently, randomised controlled trials have demonstrated that open-label placebo treatments can lead to significant and clinically relevant improvements of chronic pain conditions. METHODS AND ANALYSIS This multicentre, randomised controlled clinical trial following a parallel group between-subject design aims to systematically investigate the impact of a 12-week open-label placebo treatment on moderate to severe headache days (primary outcome) in patients with episodic and chronic migraine in addition to treatment as usual. Secondary outcomes comprise the number of migraine days, pain intensity, intake of acute medication, quality of life, disability, global impression of change, tolerability and a responder rate. To systematically address potential predictors of placebo responses in patients with migraine, this study assesses potential psychometric predictors, salivary cortisol and alpha-amylase awakening responses, catechol-o-methyltransferase Val158Met polymorphisms, as well as functional and structural brain connectivity (ie, resting state functional MRI, diffusion tensor imaging). The data analysis will be performed on basis of the general linear model considering repeated measures (mixed model).

OBJECTIVE We report on the short-term results of single-port laparoscopic ileocolic resection in patients with ileocecal Crohn's disease. DESIGN This investigation is a retrospective matched-pair control study. Data were obtained from a prospectively maintained single-institution inflammatory bowel disease database. SETTINGS This study was conducted at a tertiary care university hospital. PATIENTS Twenty consecutive patients receiving elective single-port ileocolic resection between April 2010 and May 2011 were included (6 male, 14 female; age, 31.6 ± 10.8 years; BMI, 21.5 ± 2.6 kg/m). Their data were compared with the data of 20 individually matched patients who had undergone standard 3-trocar laparoscopic-assisted ileocolic resection between 2007 and 2010 (6 male, 14 female; age, 31.7 ± 10.7 years; BMI, 21.2 ± 2.5 kg/m). All patients had medically refractory stenosis of the terminal ileum in histologically confirmed Crohn's disease. INTERVENTIONS Single-port laparoscopic-assisted or standard laparoscopic-assisted ileocolic resection was performed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcomes measured were the surgical details and early outcome. RESULTS : The mean length of the paraumbilical single-port incision was 3.8 cm (range, 2.5-5.0 cm). Conversion rates were similar in both groups (1/20 vs 2/20, p = 0.55). Additional strictureplasties or short-segment small-bowel resections were performed in both groups. The overall complication rate was 20% (4/20) in both groups. There were no observed differences in postoperative pain scores and hospital stay duration. LIMITATIONS The limitations of this study were as follows: this study was a comparison of 2 different time points with possible selection bias, there was no prestudy power calculation, and the study might be underpowered. CONCLUSIONS Single-port ileocolic resection is a safe procedure for the surgical treatment of stenotizing Crohn's disease of the terminal ileum. Avoidance of additional trocars was the only identified benefit.","Rijcken, Emile; Mennigen, Rudolf; Argyris, Ioannis; Senninger, Norbert; Bruewer, Matthias",Diseases of the colon and rectum,https://doi.org/10.1097/dcr.0b013e31823d0e0d; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22228156/,101

METHODS From February 2015 to May 2018, 100 robot-assisted partial nephrectomy patients who underwent robot-assisted partial nephrectomy without renorrhaphy for renal tumors were included. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records, and compared the perioperative outcomes of 66 and 34 patients for cT1a and cT1b tumors, respectively. Inner suture was carried out in the opened collecting system or renal sinus, whereas parenchymal renorrhaphy was not. For hemostasis, the soft-coagulation system was used, and absorbable hemostats were placed on the resection bed. RESULTS The median tumor size and RENAL nephrometry score were significantly different between the two groups (cT1a vs cT1b: 23.5 vs 45 mm, P < 0.001, 6 vs 8, P < 0.001). The median operating time and warm ischemic time were significantly longer in the cT1b group than in the cT1a group (154 vs 184 min, P < 0.001; 14 vs 21 min, P < 0.001). The median blood loss was not significantly different (2.5 vs 50 mL, P = 0.109). The positive surgical margin rate was 4.5% versus 11.7% (P = 0.22). Postoperative complications classified as Clavien-Dindo grade III or higher were port-site herniation (one patient), acute cholecystitis (one patient) and pseudoaneurysm (one patient) in the cT1b group. Urinary leakage was not observed in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS Robot-assisted partial nephrectomy without renorrhaphy using the soft-coagulation system and absorbable hemostats appears to be feasible for renal or cT1b tumors. However, longer warm ischemic time and a high rate of complications can be expected compared with cT1a tumors.","Tohi, Yoichiro; Murata, Shiori; Makita, Noriyuki; Suzuki, Issei; Kubota, Masashi; Sugino, Yoshio; Inoue, Koji; Kawakita, Mutsushi",International journal of urology : official journal of the Japanese Urological Association,https://doi.org/10.1111/iju.14046; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31257682/,101
78125,Need for a population health approach to understand and address psychosocial consequences of COVID-19.,2020-06-04,"BACKGROUND It is generally accepted that when an ignition source is used the inspired oxygen concentration (FIO2) should be <30% in the breathing circuit to help prevent airway fires. The time and conditions required to reduce a high O2% in the breathing circuit to <30% has not yet been systematically studied. METHODS We evaluated the inspired and expired circuit oxygen concentration response times of an Aestiva Avance S/5 anesthesia machine to reach an FIO2 of <30% from a starting FIO2 of 100% and 60% after reducing the FIO2 to 21%. The circuit was connected to a human patient simulator which has a functional residual capacity of 2 L, total lung capacity of 2.8 L, an oxygen consumption of 200 mL/min, and respiratory quotient of 0.8. Fresh gas flow (FGF) inputs of 2 L/min and 5 L/min were chosen to represent a spectrum of typical clinical FGF rates. Minute ventilation was set at 4 L/min. Determining the requisite median time to reach an O2 concentration of <30% in the breathing circuit was the primary aim of the study. RESULTS The median times (1st-99th percent confidence interval) required to achieve inspiratory and expiratory oxygen concentrations of <30% with the extended circuit configuration when starting at 60% for 5 L FGFs were 35 (32-36) and 104 (88-122) seconds, respectively. With 2 L FGF, these median times increased to 303 (291-313) and 255 (232-278) seconds, respectively. A shortened circuit configuration (P = 0.006) and higher FGF flow rate (P < 0.0001) were noted to be factors decreasing the median time required to achieve an oxygen concentration of <30%. CONCLUSIONS Both inspired and expired circuit oxygen concentration may take minutes to decrease to <30% depending on circuit length, FGF rate, and starting circuit oxygen concentration. During the reduction in FIO2, the expiratory oxygen concentration may be >30% for a considerable time after the FIO2 is in a ""safe"" range. An increased expired oxygen concentration should also be considered an airway fire risk, and patient care protocols may need to be modified based on future studies.","Remz, Matthew; Luria, Isaac; Gravenstein, Michael; Rice, Scott D; Morey, Timothy E; Gravenstein, Nikolaus; Rice, Mark J",Anesthesia and analgesia,https://doi.org/10.1213/ane.0b013e318298a692; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23835452/,101

METHOD A web-based cross-sectional survey was designed by the Arab Adult Arthritis Awareness group (AAAA) consisting of 16 rheumatologists representing countries from the Arab League of Associations for Rheumatology (ArLAR) and was validated by the ArLAR scientific committee. The survey was disseminated online through social media and patients' association channels between May 8 and May 22, 2020. The steering committee developed recommendations to improve the care of patients with CRD during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS A total of 2163 patients were included in the analysis; 72% were female; mean age was 40 years (SD 11.9). The Levant, the Gulf, and North Africa contributed almost equally to the sample. The pandemic had a significant negative impact on rheumatology visits in 82% of cases, access to hydroxychloroquine (47%), and chronic medication persistency (28%). The negative impact on rheumatology visits was associated with female gender, country, medication non-persistency, isolation due to COVID-19, and impact on mental health. Sixty-one patients (2.8%) stated that they had COVID-19, 5% said that a close contact was infected, and 47% were in isolation because of COVID-19.

However, emerging data on the appendix's role in chronic pain syndromes point to a previously unrecognized link between gynecologic disorders and appendicular pathology. In this article, we review the indications for appendectomy at the time of laparoscopic gynecologic surgery for the treatment of endometriosis and chronic pelvic pain. RECENT FINDINGS The incidence of appendiceal endometriosis is highly variable depending on the patient population selected. Although rare in patients undergoing appendectomy for acute appendicitis, women with endometriosis may experience rates as high as 9.3-39.0%, especially when suffering from deep infiltrative endometriosis. Appendectomy may also significantly reduce pain in women with unexplained chronic pelvic pain. SUMMARY Despite lack of prospective data, retrospective studies suggest that appendectomy during gynecologic procedures for chronic pelvic pain and severe endometriosis may be beneficial and necessary to fully address the treatment of these complex gynecologic conditions. In these clinical scenarios, the benefits of laparoscopic appendectomy at the time of the primary gynecologic procedure may outweigh the risks and cost, and should be discussed with patients preoperatively.","Peters, Ann; Mansuria, Suketu M",Current opinion in obstetrics & gynecology,https://doi.org/10.1097/gco.0000000000000466; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29889113/,101

It is based on the fact that primary and secondary hepatic tumors are vascularized mostly by arterial blood flow whereas healthy hepatocytes obtain their blood supply mostly from the portal network. This enables high radiation doses to be delivered, sparing the surrounding non-malignant liver parenchyma. Most of the complications are caused by unexpected particles passing into the gastrointestinal tract through branches originating from the main hepatic arterial supply. Knowledge of this hepatic arterial network and of its variations and the technical considerations this raises are required in preparation for treatment.

STUDY DESIGN Prospective randomized masked study. ANIMALS Ten cat cadavers (20 eyes). METHODS A dorsomedial retrobulbar injection (RB) of 1 mL of 0.5% bupivacaine and iopamidol (1:1) was performed in seven eyes. A dorsomedial peribulbar injection (PB-1) of 4 mL of the same injectate was performed in seven eyes, and two peribulbar injections (PB-2) of the same injectate, divided equally between the dorsomedial and ventrolateral regions (2 mL each) were performed in six eyes. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured before, immediately and 15 minutes after injection. Cadavers underwent computed tomography before and following injections. A radiologist scored injectate distribution within the intraconal space (none, moderate, or large) and around the optic nerve (degrees). An injection was defined as likely to provide adequate regional anesthesia if the volume of distribution of intraconal injectate was 'large' and it contacted over 270° of the optic nerve circumference. RESULTS The success rate (95% confidence interval) of RB, PB-1, and PB-2 injections was 71% (29.0-96.3%), 86% (42.1-99.6%), and 67% (22.3-95.7%), respectively. With all three techniques, IOP increased significantly after injection, but returned to baseline by 15 minutes following RB injection. No intraocular, intravascular, intrathecal, or intraneural injectate was observed. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE The single-peribulbar injection technique may be superior to retrobulbar or double-peribulbar injections, however, all techniques require further studies in live cats to determine safety and efficacy prior to clinical use.","Shilo-Benjamini, Yael; Pascoe, Peter J; Maggs, David J; Kass, Philip H; Wisner, Erik R",Veterinary anaesthesia and analgesia,https://doi.org/10.1111/vaa.12060; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23782789/,101

Evidence shows high prevalence of mental health disorder among women refugees in comparison to the general population. To our knowledge, no systematic reviews have addressed access to mental health services for refugee women. The aim of this study will be to examine existing barriers and facilitators to accessing mental health services for refugee women in leading high-income countries for refugee resettlement. METHODS We designed and registered a study protocol for a systematic review. We will conduct a literature search (from inception onwards) in MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and CINAHL. Research articles having a qualitative component (i.e., qualitative, mixed, or multi-method) will be eligible. Study populations of interest will be refugee women at any age that can receive mental health services in leading high-income countries for refugee resettlement (e.g., 14 countries from North America, Europe, and Oceania). Eligibility will be restricted to studies published in English. The primary outcome will be all barriers and facilitators related to accessing mental health services. Two reviewers will independently screen all citations, full-text articles, and abstract data. Potential conflicts will be resolved through discussion. The study methodological quality (or bias) will be appraised using appropriate tools. Reporting will follow the Enhancing Transparency in Reporting the Synthesis of Qualitative Research (ENTREQ) statement. A narrative synthesis will be conducted, and summary of findings tables will be produced. As it will be a systematic review, without human participants' involvement, there will be no requirement for ethical approval. DISCUSSION The systematic review will present key evidence on barriers and facilitators to access mental health services among refugee women in leading resettlement countries.

79673,COVID-19 and lockdown: Insights from Mumbai.,2020-06-01,"BACKGROUND HVTN 098, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, evaluated the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of PENNVAX®-GP HIV DNA vaccine, administered with or without plasmid IL-12 (pIL-12), via intradermal (ID) or intramuscular (IM) electroporation (EP) in healthy, HIV-uninfected adults. The study tested whether PENNVAX®-GP delivered via ID/EP at 1/5th the dose could elicit equivalent immune responses to delivery via IM/EP, and if inclusion of pIL-12 provided additional benefit. METHODS Participants received DNA encoding HIV-1 env/gag/pol in three groups: 1.6mg ID (ID no IL-12 group, n=20), 1.6mg ID + 0.4mg pIL-12 (ID+IL-12 group, n=30), 8mg IM + 1mg pIL-12 (IM+IL-12 group, n=30) or placebo (n=9) via EP at 0, 1, 3 and 6 months. Results of cellular and humoral immunogencity assessments are reported. RESULTS Following vaccination, the frequency of responders (response rate) to any HIV protein based on CD4+ T-cells expressing IFN-γ and/or IL-2 was 96% for both the ID+IL-12 and IM+IL-12 groups; CD8+ T-cell response rates were 64% and 44%, respectively. For ID delivery, the inclusion of pIL-12 increased CD4+ T-cell response rate from 56% to 96%. The frequency of responders was similar (>90%) for IgG binding Ab to gp140 consensus Env across all groups, but the magnitude was higher in the ID+IL-12 group compared to the IM+IL-12 group. CONCLUSION PENNVAX®-GP DNA induced robust cellular and humoral immune responses, demonstrating that immunogenicity of DNA vaccines can be enhanced by EP route and inclusion of pIL-12. ID/EP was dose-sparing, inducing equivalent, or in some aspects superior, immune responses compared to IM/EP.

79692,When chaos is the norm: How some veterans with PTSD are continuing to engage in trauma-focused treatments during the COVID-19 pandemic.,2020-05-28,"IntroductionUnacceptable practices of health care providers during disasters have been observed because they work outside the scope of their daily practices and have inadequate training. A greater need for the involvement of health professionals in disaster management has been noted in Saudi Arabia. This study evaluates the efficacy of a training course in prehospital major incident management for health care providers in Saudi Arabia. METHODS An interactive course for general principles in prehospital major incident management was developed with domains and core competencies. The course was designed according to the local context and was based on international standards. It was piloted over four days at the Officers Club of the Ministry of Interior (Riyadh, Saudi Arabia) and was sponsored by Mohammed Bin Naif Medical Center, King Fahd Security College in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The participants (n=29) were from different disciplines from main government health facilities in Riyadh. They completed a pre-test and a post-test. RESULTS The overall score was 55.1% on the pre-test and 68.4% on the post-test (Wilcoxon test for paired samples, P <.05). Three out of the four domains had significant difference between pre- and post-test results, as well as the overall total knowledge. CONCLUSION Conducting inter-disciplinary and competency-based disaster medicine courses for health care providers can augment appropriate disaster preparedness for major incidents in Saudi Arabia.

80040,Staying safe during COVID-19: How a pandemic can escalate risk for intimate partner violence and what can be done to provide individuals with resources and support.,2020-06-18,"Rationale: Resection of soft tissue sarcomas (STS) is accompanied by a high rate of tumor-positive surgical margins (14-34%), which potentially leads to decreased disease-free survival. Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor-A (VEGF-A) is overexpressed in malignant tumors, including STS, and can be targeted with bevacizumab-800CW during fluorescence-guided surgery for real-time tumor detection. In this phase 1 clinical trial, we determined the feasibility, safety and optimal dose of bevacizumab-800CW for fluorescence-guided surgery (FGS) in STS for in- and ex vivo tumor detection. Methods: Patients with a histopathologically diagnosis of STS were included. In the dose-escalation phase, patients received bevacizumab-800CW intravenously 3 days prior to surgery (10, 25 and 50 mg, n = 8). In the subsequent dose-expansion phase, 7 additional patients received bevacizumab-800CW at the optimal dose. Fluorescence images in- and ex vivo were obtained during all stages of standard of care. The optimal dose was determined by calculating in- and ex vivo Tumor-to-Background ratios (TBR) and correlating these results with histopathology. Results: Fifteen patients with STS completed this study. All tumors could be visualized during in- and ex vivo imaging. The optimal bevacizumab-800CW dose proved to be 10 mg with a median in vivo TBR of 2.0 (±0.58) and an ex vivo TBR of 2.67 (±1.6). All seven tumor-positive margins could be observed real-time after surgical resection. Conclusion: FGS using 10 mg bevacizumab-800CW is feasible and safe for intra-operative imaging of STS, potentially allowing tumor detection and margin assessment during surgery. An additional follow-up phase II study is needed to confirm the diagnostic accuracy.","Steinkamp, Pieter Jan; Pranger, Bobby Klaas; Li, Meifang; Linssen, Matthijs D; Voskuil, Floris Jan; Been, Lukas B; van Leeuwen, Barbara L; Suurmeijer, Albert J H; Nagengast, Wouter B; Kruijff, Schelto K; van Ginkel, Robert J; van Dam, Gooitzen Michell","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",https://doi.org/10.2967/jnumed.120.245696; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32680922/,101

80174,Health and Social Care During Coronavirus Outbreak: The Exploitation of Long Lasting Memories - LLM Care.,2021-05-27,"OBJECTIVES We aimed to characterize the combined impact of federal, state, and institutional policies on barriers to expanding medication and telemedicine abortion care delivery during the COVID-19 pandemic in the abortion-restrictive states of Ohio, Kentucky, and West Virginia. STUDY DESIGN We analyzed four state policies, two COVID-related state executive orders, and clinic-level survey data on medication abortion provision from fourteen abortion facilities in Ohio, Kentucky, and West Virginia from December 2019 to December 2020. We calculated the percent of medication abortions provided at these facilities during the study period by state, to assess changes in medication abortion use during the pandemic. RESULTS We ascertained that COVID-19-executive orders in Ohio and West Virginia that limited procedural abortion in Spring 2020 coincided with an increase in the overall number and proportion of medication abortions in this region, peaking at 1613 medication abortions (70%) in April 2020. Ohio and West Virginia, which had executive orders limiting procedural abortion, saw relatively greater increases in April compared to Kentucky. Despite temporary lifting of the mifepristone REMS, pre-pandemic regulations banning telemedicine abortion in Kentucky and West Virginia and requiring in-person clinic visits for medication abortion distribution in Ohio limited clinics' ability to adapt to offer medication abortion by mail. CONCLUSIONS Our findings illustrate how restrictive medication and telemedicine abortion policies in Ohio, Kentucky, and West Virginia created additional obstacles for patients seeking medication abortion during the pandemic. Permanently lifting federal regulations on in-clinic distribution of mifepristone would only advantage abortion seekers in states without restrictive telehealth and medication abortion policies. State policies that limit access to comprehensive abortion services should be central in larger efforts toward dismantling barriers that impinge upon reproductive autonomy. IMPLICATION STATEMENT We find that abolishing the REMS on mifepristone would not be enough to expand access to patients in abortion-restrictive states with telemedicine and medication abortion laws. While the REMS is a barrier, it represents one of several hindrances to the expansion of telemedicine abortion distribution across the US.","Mello, Kelsey; Smith, Mikaela H; Hill, B Jessie; Chakraborty, Payal; Rivlin, Katherine; Bessett, Danielle; Norris, Alison H; McGowan, Michelle L",Contraception,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.contraception.2021.04.020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33930382/,101

An experience of integration between prevention and primary care in the proactive management of possible cases].,2020,"Soft robots offer an alternative approach to manipulate within a constrained space while maintaining a safe interaction with the external environment. Owing to its adaptable compliance characteristic, external contact force can easily deform the robot shapes and lead to undesired robot kinematic and dynamic properties. Accurate contact detection and contact location estimation are of critical importance for soft robot modeling, control, trajectory planning, and eventually affect the success of task completion. In this article, we focus on the investigation of a one degree of freedom (1-DoF) soft pneumatic bending robot, which is regarded as one of the fundamental components to construct complex, multi-DoFs soft robots. This 1-DoF soft robot is modeled through the integral representation of the spatial curve, where direct and instantaneous kinematics are calculated explicitly through a modal method. The fixed centrode deviation method is used to detect the external contact and estimate the contact location. Simulation results and experimental studies indicate that the contact location can be accurately estimated by solving a nonlinear least-square optimization problem. Experimental validation shows that the proposed algorithm is able to successfully estimate the contact location with the estimation error of 1.46 mm.","Chen, Yue; Wang, Long; Galloway, Kevin; Godage, Isuru; Simaan, Nabil; Barth, Eric",Soft robotics,https://doi.org/10.1089/soro.2019.0095; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32668189/,101
81694,On the frontlines: Protecting low-wage workers during COVID-19.,2020-06-18,"ANCA-associated RPGN leads to renal failure through systemic vasculitis and diffuse crescentic glomerulonephritis. MPO-ANCA-RPGN patients are highly susceptible to infections. Our aim in this study was to uncover reasons why these patients were susceptible to infections. We analyzed various aspects of type I interferon system including HVJ-stimulated IFN-α producing capacity and plasmacytoid dendritic cell (pDC) number in whole blood in MPO-ANCA-RPGN patients. Compared with healthy subjects, MPO-ANCA-RPGN patients showed impaired HVJ-stimulated IFN-α producing capacity and lower pDC number with or without glucocorticoid treatment. Immuno-histological staining of MPO-ANCA-RPGN kidney samples revealed a few but apparent pDC in T cell infiltrating regions even in patients with low pDC number in their peripheral blood. Patients' low HVJ-stimulated IFN-α producing capacity and pDC numbers persisted even after patients underwent several years of treatment. Former infection was determined using patients' serum BPI, Lamp-2 and Calprotectin, since they are reflective of a history of infection. These markers were higher in MPO-ANCA-RPGN patients than in healthy subjects. These results indicate that impaired HVJ-stimulated IFN-α production as well as dysfunction of the IFN system might have resulted from a previous bout of infection and can be partially implicated in patients' long-term susceptibility and vulnerability to infection.","Uno, Kazuko; Muso, Eri; Ito-Ihara, Toshiko; Endo, Tomomi; Yasuda, Yuko; Yagi, Katusmi; Suzuki, Kazuo",Cytokine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cyto.2020.155221; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32828064/,101

83516,The paradox of social distancing: Implications for older adults in the context of COVID-19.,2020-06-11,"OBJECTIVE Infectious disease emergencies like the 2013-2016 Ebola epidemic and the 2009 influenza and current SARS-CoV-2 pandemics illustrate that vaccines are now given to diverse populations with pre-existing pathologies requiring pharmacological management. Many natural biomolecules (steroid hormones, fatty acids, vitamins) and ~60% of prescribed medications are processed by hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4. The objective of this work was to determine the impact of infection and vaccines on drug metabolism. METHODS The impact of an adenovirus-based vaccine expressing Ebola glycoprotein (AdEBO) and H1N1 and H3N2 influenza viruses on hepatic CYP 3A4 and associated nuclear receptors was evaluated in human hepatocytes (HC-04 cells) and in mice. RESULTS CYP3A activity was suppressed by 55% in mice 24h after administration of mouse adapted H1N1 while ˂ 10% activity remained in HC-04 cells after infection with H1N1 and H3N2 due to global suppression of cellular translation capacity, indicated by reduction (70%, H1N1, 56%, H3N2) of phosphorylated eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4e (eIF4E). AdEBO suppressed CYP3A activity in vivo (44%) and in vitro (26%) 24 hours after infection. CONCLUSION As clinical evaluation of vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 and other global pathogens rise, studies to evaluate the impact of new vaccines and emerging pathogens on CYP3A4 and other metabolic enzymes are warranted to avoid therapeutic failures that could further compromise public health during infectious disease emergencies.","Jonsson-Schmunk, Kristina; Ghose, Romi; Croyle, Maria A",Expert review of vaccines,https://doi.org/10.1080/14760584.2021.1899818; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33666138/,101

Surveys (Zika, N = 410; COVID-19, N = 291) were used to investigate the role of media use and interpersonal communication on the relationship between 10 concepts in multidimensional spaces. We asked these four research questions: Do the two spaces represent the two pandemics similarly? What is the relationship of me and of people to each pandemic? What is the effect of virus-related media use and interpersonal talk on the pandemic space? What are optimal messages for moving me closer to Zika and to COVID-19? Media use influenced the distances for both pandemics: With greater media use, the concepts were closer in the Zika space and further apart in the COVID-19 space. Interpersonal communication was associated with few differences in the spaces. Based on the psychological distances between concepts, optimal messages were identified: For Zika, a message with two concepts, people and women, is predicted to be most effective to move Zika to the concept me, whereas for COVID-19, a message with people is predicted to be most effective to move COVID-19 to me.","Fink, Edward L; Smith, Rachel A; Cai, Deborah A; Jung, Heeyoung Jenni; Woelfel, Joseph",Health communication,https://doi.org/10.1080/10410236.2020.1857506; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33397156/,101

METHODS We used mass spectrometry to analyse a selection of RNA-modifying enzymes and the N6-methyladenosine (m6A) in carotid atherosclerotic lesion samples representing early and advanced stages of atherosclerosis as compared to non-atherosclerotic arteries from healthy controls. FINDINGS (i) the detection of different levels of several enzymes involved in methylations occurring in rRNA and mRNA; (ii) these findings included changes in the levels of methyltransferases ('writers'), binding proteins ('readers') and demethylases ('erasers') during atherosclerosis as compared to non-atherosclerotic control arteries, with generally the most prominent differences in samples from early atherosclerotic lesions; and (iii) these changes were accompanied by a marked downregulation of m6A in rRNA, the most abundant and well-studied modification in mRNA with a wide range of effects on cell biology.

INTRODUCTION Management of the severe thoracolumbar (TL) spine fracture-dislocation injuries have been further complicated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The need to optimize resources and minimize the personnel in the operating room (OR) led us to develop a novel technique to reduce TL fracture-dislocations (AO type-C) using an orthopedic distractor device (ODD). METHODS This prospective study was conducted at a tertiary care spine center with a study duration from March 2020 to May 2020 coinciding with the nationwide lockdown and travel restrictions imposed in view of the COVID-19 crisis. Only patients with AO type C fracture-dislocation managed using the ODD operated by a single surgeon were included in the study. RESULTS Of 12 cases, the most commonly affected level was D12-L1. Nine patients were American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale (AIS) A at presentation, two patients were AIS B, and one AIS C. The mean operative time was 125 min and mean blood loss was 454 ml. Eight patients remained AIS A, one patient improved from AIS B to C. Two patients became independent walkers, one remained AIS B. The post-operative VAS score improved to a mean value of 2.33. The improvement in kyphosis was 26.24° immediate postoperatively and maintained at 25.9°, percentage height loss reduced to 2.75% immediate postoperatively and maintained at 3.16% at 3 months follow-up. CONCLUSIONS Management of TL fracture-dislocations in COVID times of health care resource scarcity can be challenging.

In the current study, we explore the influence of rearing environment and experimenter administered adolescent ethanol on the hedonic value of ethanol, sucrose, and quinine. Male and female rats were reared for 30 days starting at postnatal day (PND) 21 in either an enriched, isolated, or standard condition and received 1.5 g/kg (i.p.) 20% (w/v) ethanol or saline every other day for 12 days starting at PND 28. Thereafter, all rats had indwelling intraoral fistulae implanted and their taste reactivity to water, ethanol (5, 10, 20, 30, 40% v/v), sucrose (0.1, 0.25, 0.5 M), and quinine (0.1, 0.5 mM) was recorded and analyzed. Results indicated that enrichment elevated hedonic responding to sucrose compared to isolation and induced a stronger negative relationship between hedonic responding and ethanol concentration compared to standard conditions. Enrichment also elevated aversive responding to ethanol and quinine compared to both isolated and standard condition rats. Adolescent ethanol injections marginally reduced aversive responding to quinine. These results replicate previous findings that environmental enrichment enhances both ""liking"" and aversion. In addition, the current findings suggest that, while adolescent ethanol injections may blunt aversive responses to quinine, they have no effect on aversive or hedonic responding to ethanol or sucrose. Together with existing literature our results may suggest that experience with the taste of ethanol is necessary for alterations to ethanol ""liking"" and aversion.","Wukitsch, Thomas J; Moser, Theodore J; Brase, Emma C; Kiefer, Stephen W; Cain, Mary E",Alcohol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.alcohol.2020.09.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32937167/,101

The emergence of the highly pathogenic coronavirus severe acute respiratory virus (SARS-CoV) serves as a robust model system to elucidate the virus-host interactions that mediate severe end-stage lung disease in humans and animals. Coronaviruses encode the largest positive-sense RNA genome of approximately 30 kb, encode a variety of replicase and accessory open reading frames that are structurally unique, and encode novel enzymatic functions among RNA viruses. These viruses have broad or specific host ranges, suggesting the possibility of novel strategies for targeting and regulating host innate immune responses following virus infection. Using SARS-CoV as a model, we review the current literature on the ability of coronaviruses to interact with and modify the host intracellular environment during infection.

This study was designed to develop an HPLC-MS/MS method for the determination of silybin in human plasma, urine and breast tissue in early breast cancer patients undergoing Siliphos® supplementation, an oral silybin-phosphatidylcholine complex. The determination of silybin was carried out by liquid-liquid extraction with methyl-tert-butyl ether (MTBE); total silybin concentration was determined by treating the samples with β-glucuronidase, while for the determination of free silybin, the hydrolytic step was omitted. Naringenin and naproxen were selected as internal standards. The detection of the analyte was carried out by mass spectrometry and by chromatography. The HPLC-MS/MS method was evaluated in terms of selectivity, linearity, limit of quantification, precision and accuracy, and carryover.

Among refereed patient, the incidence of pure hyperbilirubinemia as rare gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms was obvious. METHODS In this case series, we have reported the clinical data in details for patients with COVID-19 who have been admitted to the Shahid Beheshti Hospital in Qom city, from 3 March to 3 August 2020. COVID infection, be confirmed by using real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) and chest computed tomography (CT) scan, as well. RESULTS According to the clinical findings, pure hyperbilirubinemia may consider as rare gastrointestinal (GI) symptom of COVID-19. However, it is possible that the other GI enzymes values fall in to the normal range. CONCLUSION In some infected patients, GI physicians may face hepatic involvement as pure hyperbilirubinemia. At the age of COVID-19 crisis, all GI physicians should be aware of the possible occurrence of hepatic involvement as an important prognosis of COVID pneumonia and it should be exactly addressed in new referred patients to GI clinic.","Hormati, Ahmad; Ghadir, Mohammad Reza; Saeidi, Mohammad; Aminnejad, Reza; Afifian, Mahboubeh; Ahmadpour, Sajjad",Infectious disorders drug targets,https://doi.org/10.2174/1871526521666210218201601; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33602079/,101
88504,Using COVID-19 responses to help strengthen the mental health system in Lebanon.,2020-06-15,"Agricultural water management (AWM) interventions play an important role in ensuring sustainable food production and mitigating climate risks. This study was carried out in a watershed located in a low rainfall (400-600 mm) region of western India. The SWAT model was calibrated using surface runoff, soil loss and reservoir storage levels, between the year 2000 and 2006. The investigation indicated that the various AWM interventions increased groundwater recharge from 30 mm/year to 80 mm/year and reduced surface runoff from 250 mm/year to 100 mm/year. The intervention structures were refilled 2 to 3 times during the monsoon season depending on rainfall intensity and duration. The interventions have the advantage of building a resilient system by enhancing groundwater availability even in dry years, stimulating crop intensification and protecting the landscape from severe erosion. The results indicate that soil erosion has been reduced by more than 75% compared to the non-intervention situation. Moreover, the AWM interventions led to the cultivation of 100-150 ha of fallow land with high value crops (horticulture, vegetables and fodder). Household income increased by several-folds compared to the non-intervention situation. The study showed about 50% reduction in downstream water availability, which could be a major concern. However, there are a number of ecosystem trade-offs such as improved base flow to the stream and reduction in soil loss that should be considered. The study is of great importance to stakeholders to decide on the optimum design for AWM interventions to achieve sustainable development goals.","Garg, Kaushal K; Anantha, K H; Radha, A Venkata; Dixit, Sreenath; Singh, Ramesh; Ragab, Ragab",Ground water,https://doi.org/10.1111/gwat.13099; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33763866/,101
88828,Safe use of chemicals and risk communication among dentists and dental students in Greece.,2020-06-01,"BACKGROUND There is growing interest in the pathophysiological processes of preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD), including the potential role of leptin. Human studies have shown that both low and high levels of leptin can be associated with worse neurocognitive outcomes, suggesting this relationship may be moderated by another risk factor. OBJECTIVE We examined the association between plasma leptin levels and both neuropsychological test performance and structural neuroimaging and assessed whether body mass index (BMI) is an effect modifier of these associations. METHODS Our study sample consisted of 2,223 adults from the Framingham Heart Study Third Generation Cohort (average age = 40 years, 53% women). RESULTS Among the entire sample, there was no association between leptin and any of the neuropsychological domain measures or any of the MRI brain volume measures, after adjustment for BMI, APOE4, and other clinical factors. However, we did observe that BMI category was an effect modifier for the association between leptin and verbal memory (p for interaction = 0.03), where higher levels of leptin were associated with better performance among normal weight participants (BMI 18.5-24.9) kg/m2 (beta = 0.12, p = 0.02). No association was observed between leptin level and verbal memory test performance among participants who were overweight or obese. CONCLUSION These findings suggest that the association between leptin and cognitive function is moderated by BMI category. Prospective examination of individuals transitioning from middle age to older adulthood will help to clarify the contribution of leptin to AD and other neurodegenerative conditions.","Sanborn, Victoria; Preis, Sarah R; Ang, Alvin; Devine, Sherral; Mez, Jesse; DeCarli, Charles; Au, Rhoda; Alosco, Michael L; Gunstad, John",Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,https://doi.org/10.3233/jad-191247; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32831199/,101
89089,Ethics and Economic Growth in the Age of COVID 19: What Is a Just Society to Do?,2020-04-03,"RNA 3' end processing provides a source of transcriptome diversification which affects various (patho)-physiological processes. A prime example is the transcript isoform switch that leads to the read-through expression of the long non-coding RNA NEAT1_2, at the expense of the shorter polyadenylated transcript NEAT1_1. NEAT1_2 is required for assembly of paraspeckles (PS), nuclear bodies that protect cancer cells from oncogene-induced replication stress and chemotherapy. Searching for proteins that modulate this event, we identified factors involved in the 3' end processing of polyadenylated RNA and components of the Integrator complex. Perturbation experiments established that, by promoting the cleavage of NEAT1_2, Integrator forces NEAT1_2 to NEAT1_1 isoform switching and, thereby, restrains PS assembly. Consistently, low levels of Integrator subunits correlated with poorer prognosis of cancer patients exposed to chemotherapeutics. Our study establishes that Integrator regulates PS biogenesis and a link between Integrator, cancer biology, and chemosensitivity, which may be exploited therapeutically.","Barra, Jasmine; Gaidosh, Gabriel S; Blumenthal, Ezra; Beckedorff, Felipe; Tayari, Mina M; Kirstein, Nina; Karakach, Tobias K; Jensen, Torben Heick; Impens, Francis; Gevaert, Kris; Leucci, Eleonora; Shiekhattar, Ramin; Marine, Jean-Christophe",Science advances,https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aaz9072; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32923585/,101

Here, we design a photodynamic therapy (PDT)-motivated ATV (P-ATV) in Fmoc-KCRGDK-phenylboronic acid (FK-PBA) hydrogel, which mobilizes local immune activation to inhibit relapse of postoperative tumors. The FK-PBA targeting overexpressed sialic acid on tumor cells can enable on-demand gelation in residue tumor areas and maintain continuous vaccination in surgical bed. Unlike neoantigen-based vaccine or adoptive cell therapy that takes several months to prepare, P-ATV can be easily manufactured within a few days and efficiently boost neoepitope-specific CD8+ T cells to activate personalized immunotherapy. This simple and powerful approach of engineered ATVs provides an alternative strategy for personalized immunotherapy and is readily transformable to various kinds of cell-based antigens to inhibit the relapse of postoperative tumors.","Fang, Lei; Zhao, Zitong; Wang, Jue; Zhang, Pengcheng; Ding, Yaping; Jiang, Yanyan; Wang, Dangge; Li, Yaping",Science advances,https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aba4024; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32596457/,101

Implementation of a robotic curriculum is necessary and will influence surgical training. The aim of this study is to compare surgical experience and outcomes with and without resident participation in robotic inguinal herniorrhaphy. A retrospective review of patients who underwent either unilateral or bilateral robotic-assisted transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) inguinal herniorrhaphy, with and without resident participation as console surgeons from January through December 2015, was performed. Patient demographics, procedure-related data, postoperative variables, and follow-up data were analyzed. A total of 104 patients were included. Patients were significantly older in the Resident group (57.5 ± 14.1 vs 50.6 ± 13.5 years, p = 0.01). Gender, BMI, and ASA classification were similar between groups. There were similar mean operative times for unilateral (89.9 ± 19.5 vs 84.8 ± 22.2 min, p = 0.42) and bilateral (128.4 ± 21.9 vs 129.8 ± 50.9 min, p = 0.90) inguinal herniorrhaphy as well as mean robot console times for unilateral (73.2 ± 18.4 vs 67.3 ± 29.9 min, p = 0.44) and bilateral (115.5 ± 24.6 vs 109.3 ± 55.4 min, p = 0.67) inguinal herniorrhaphy with and without resident participation, respectively. Postoperative complications included urinary retention (11.1 vs 2.0%, p = 0.11), conversion to open repair (0 vs 2%, p = 0.48), and delayed reoperation (0 vs 4%, p = 0.22) with and without resident participation, respectively. Patients' symptoms/signs at follow-up were similar among groups.

The World Health Organization has taken steps toward establishing a global surveillance system for RSV, based on the global influenza surveillance and response system initiated in 2015. The US Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has developed a genetic detection method based on real-time RT-PCR, which is used in global RSV surveillance. In Japan, immunoassay-based rapid antigen detection kits are widely used for the detection of RSV. In this study, an ultra-rapid real-time RT-PCR method for the rapid detection of RSV was developed using the PCR1100 device based on the US CDC assay in order to detect RSV in comparable time to rapid test kits. The ultra-rapid real-time RT-PCR could detect RSV viral RNA in less than 20 min while maintaining sensitivity and specificity comparable to conventional real-time RT-PCR using large installed instruments. Furthermore, combining ultra-rapid real-time RT-PCR with the M1 Sample Prep kit reduced the total working time for the detection of RSV from clinical specimen to less than 25 min, suggesting this method could be used for point-of-care RSV testing.","Shirato, Kazuya; Nao, Naganori; Kawase, Miyuki; Kageyama, Tsutomu",Japanese journal of infectious diseases,https://doi.org/10.7883/yoken.jjid.2020.182; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32475879/,101
92220,Expression of concern: The frontier framework (and its eight frontier archetypes): A new conceptual approach to representing staff and patient well-being in health systems.,2020-08-01,"BACKGROUND Obesity is a leading comorbidity in psoriatic disease, including both psoriasis (PsO) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA), and is associated with adverse metabolic and cardiovascular (CV) outcomes. Anthropometric parameters, such as weight, body mass index (BMI) and waist-to-hip ratio, have been extensively reported in psoriatic disease. However, the associations of body composition and fat distribution with psoriasis have not yet been fully defined. OBJECTIVES To identify whether patients with psoriatic disease, including psoriatic arthritis, have altered body composition compared with the general population, and to review existing modalities for the assessment of body composition. METHODS Electronic searches of the literature were conducted in PubMed, Medline (Ovid®), Embase (Ovid®), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and Google Scholar. Titles and abstracts were reviewed by two authors independently against a set of prespecified inclusion/exclusion criteria. The research question was answered with a systematic literature review and results were summarized narratively. RESULTS Twenty-five full text articles met the inclusion criteria and were included in the final narrative analysis. The studies were of heterogeneous design and used a range of objective measures to assess body composition, including simple anthropometric measures, bioimpedance analysis (BIA), dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and computed tomography (CT). Few studies met all the quality assessment criteria. Clinical heterogeneity prevented meta-analysis. CONCLUSIONS Patients with psoriatic disease reveal defined body composition changes that are independent of obesity and the customary metabolic syndrome, including higher overall body fat, visceral fat and sarcopenia. These findings emphasize that patients with psoriatic disease should be screened for abnormal adipose effects beyond their weight and body mass index (BMI). Our findings show that the last decade has seen an exciting expansion of research interest in the development and validation of new modalities for the assessment of body composition. There is no consensus on the optimal assessment method of body composition for this diverse group; hence there is a need for validation of existing modalities and standardization of assessment tools.","Blake, Tim; Gullick, Nicola J; Hutchinson, Charles E; Barber, Thomas M",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0237598; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32790787/,101

We hypothesized that the higher voltage coag mode would create more unintended thermal tissue injury at the epigastric trocar's incision. METHODS A prospective blinded randomized controlled trial of patients undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed. Patients were randomized to have their operation performed with the monopolar instrument set at 30 W on either the coag mode or the blend mode. Immediately at the end of the operation, a biopsy sample of skin was obtained from the lower edge of the epigastric incision (through which the monopolar instrument was inserted) and the umbilical incision (through which the camera/telescope was inserted). The outcomes measured were histologic evidence of thermal injury at the epigastric and umbilical incisions (determined by a blinded pathologist). RESULTS Forty patients were randomized (20 per group). Baseline demographics in the two groups were similar for age, gender, body mass index, preoperative diagnosis, operative time, and blood loss. Unintentional thermal injury was found at 20 % of epigastric incisions and 35 % of umbilical incisions in the total group. The incidence of thermal injury was higher after operations using the coag mode compared to the blend mode at both the epigastric (35 vs. 5 %; p = 0.044) and umbilical (55 vs. 15 %; p = 0.019) trocar incisions. CONCLUSIONS Radiofrequency energy from the monopolar Bovie instrument causes unintentional thermal injury to skin adjacent to the epigastric and umbilical trocar incisions. The incidence of thermal injury was reduced by using the lower voltage blend mode compared to the coag mode at both the epigastric and umbilical trocar incisions.

The primary outcome of the study is to assess improvements in balance, posture and deambulation after abdominal hernia repair. Moreover, the study investigated the improvement in the postoperative QoL. METHODS Patients operated at the Policlinico ""Paolo Giaccone"" at Palermo University Hospital between June 2015 and June 2017 were identified in a prospective database. The functional outcome measures and QoL assessment scales used were numeric rating scale for pain, performance-oriented mobility assessment (POMA) scale, Quebec back pain disability scale, center of gravity (barycenter) variation evaluation, Short-Form (36) Health Survey (SF-36 test), sit-up test and Activities Assessment Scale (AAS). The timepoints at which the parameters listed were assessed for the study were 1 week before the surgical operation and 6 months later. RESULTS The POMA scale showed a significant improvement, with an overall preoperative score of (mean; SD) 18.80 ± 2.17 and a postoperative score of 23.56 ± 2.24 with a p < 0.003. The improvement of the barycenter was significant with p = 0.03 and 0.01 for the right and left inferior limbs, respectively. Finally, common daily activities reported by the SF-36 test and by the AAS were significantly improved with a reported p of ≤0.04 for 5 of eight items and ≤0.002 for all items, respectively. CONCLUSIONS The improvement in such physical measures proves the importance of abdominal wall restoration to recover functional activity in the muscle-skeletal complex balance, gait and movement performance.","Licari, Leo; Guercio, Giovanni; Campanella, Sofia; Scerrino, Gregorio; Bonventre, Sebastiano; Tutino, Roberta; Gulotta, Leonardo; Profita, Giuseppe; Scaturro, Dalila; Letizia Mauro, Giulia; Salamone, Giuseppe",World journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00268-019-05003-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31011821/,101

There are two different types of ESUs: monopolar (m-ESU) and bipolar (b-ESU). AIMS We used m- and b-ESUs in upper, lower, and combined blepharoplasty and compared their outcomes. PATIENTS/METHODS In this retrospective file review of 292 blepharoplasty patients, we excluded 14 who were lost to follow-up or had missing data; among the 278 enrolled patients, we recorded operative time, a surgeon panel's score for edema and ecchymosis on the third postoperative day, patients' scores of their satisfaction and inconvenience, and postoperative complications. RESULTS One hundred thirty-nine patients were included in the m-ESU and b-ESU group. Overall, 105 patients underwent upper blepharoplasty, 77 underwent lower blepharoplasty, and 96 underwent combined blepharoplasty. The total mean operative time in the m-ESU and b-ESU was 67.94 and 62.82 minutes, respectively. This difference was not significant (P > .05). The panel's edema and patient satisfaction and inconvenience scores were significantly better in the b-ESU group (P < .05). There were no significant differences in the panel's ecchymosis score and frequency as well as nature of complications between the m-ESU and b-ESU group (P > .05). CONCLUSIONS In this cohort of blepharoplasty patients, minimally invasive b-ESUs were efficient in obtaining reliable surgical results with higher satisfaction and lower inconvenience rates of patients than m-ESUs.

We sought to develop a superior, simpler pancreaticojejunostomy technique. MATERIALS AND METHODS We applied a running barbed suture (V-Loc™; Covidien, Mansfield, MA) to perform the pancreaticojejunostomy over a stent placed in the pancreatic duct and a small enterotomy in the jejunum. This technique was attempted in the last 19 of 37 patients presenting to two surgeons (M.A.M. and B.H.E.) for a laparoscopic Whipple procedure. Data were collected on operative time, pancreatic leak events, and related complications. RESULTS We successfully applied the modified technique in all 19 patients. Pancreatic leak occurred in 5% of patients with the modified technique (Grade A=0; Grade B=1; Grade C=0) and 11% with the standard technique (Grade A=1; Grade B=1; Grade C=0). All leaks were managed with external drainage. There were no leak-related complications. Mean operative time was shorter for the modified technique (mean, 367 minutes; range, 260-576 minutes) than the standard technique (mean, 440 minutes; range, 300-665 minutes).

This trial evaluated the comparative effect of communicating personal mental ill-health risk profiles on psychological distress. METHODS Australian participants using a mood-monitoring app were randomly allocated to receiving their current personal mental ill-health risk profile (n = 119), their achievable personal risk profile (n = 118) or to a control group (n = 118) in which no risk information was communicated, in a non-inferiority trial design. The primary outcome was psychological distress at four-weeks as assessed on the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale. RESULTS There was high attrition in the trial with 64% of data missing at follow up. Per-protocol (completer) analysis found that the lower bounds of the confidence intervals of the estimated mean change of the current risk (m = 0.19, 95% CI: -2.59- 2.98) and achievable risk (m = -0.09, 95% CI: -2.84 to 2.66) groups were within the non-inferiority margin of the control group's mean at follow up.

Patients completed a self-evaluation questionnaire at 2 weeks and were examined after 1 year. RESULTS Some 198 patients received self-fixating mesh and 196 sutured mesh. There were no differences between the groups in mean pain scores measured on a visual analogue scale during 2 weeks of immediate convalescence or at 1 year. Chronic pain and discomfort was experienced by 36.3 per cent of patients in the self-fixating and 34.1 per cent in the sutured mesh group (P = 0.658), affecting the everyday life of 1.1 and 2.8 per cent respectively (P = 0.448). CONCLUSION Open inguinal hernia repair with a composite self-fixating mesh resulted in similar pain in the early postoperative convalescence period and at 1 year as repair with a sutured lightweight mesh.","Pierides, G; Scheinin, T; Remes, V; Hermunen, K; Vironen, J",The British journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1002/bjs.8705; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22362035/,101
99133,Understanding the mental health burden of COVID-19 in the United Kingdom.,2020-06-01,"Background: This article presents the results of a comprehensive national model developed for managing maladaptive behaviors (MBs) in children with mental special needs (CMSNs) during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic that combines telehealth-based Applied Behavioral Analyses, psychiatric interventions, and support from local psychosocial teams. This study aims to determine the effectiveness of a system that combined telehealth applications with local psychosocial support teams, allowing services from video calls to emergency interventions. Materials and Methods: The system combines the telehealth applications with the services from local psychosocial intervention teams. In addition to system records covering sociodemographic variables and initial complaints, a telephone survey questioning the effectiveness and satisfaction of the system was used as the main outcome. Results: In total, 347 individuals used the system with mothers constituting the majority of applicants (88.7%, n = 332). The overall satisfaction of the system was 8.8/10. In terms of effectiveness, 63.3% (n = 237) of caregivers reported an improvement in the reason of application. Counselors decided on a need for follow-up visits for 36.6% (n = 137) of applications. A referral to a psychiatrist was asked for 40 patients (10.6%). Discussion: To our best knowledge, this is the first study presenting a model for managing MBs of CMSNs during the COVID-19 outbreak. In general, therefore, it seems that there is a need for unique systems to handle behavioral problems of CMSNs. Conclusions: The findings of this study suggest that it is possible to establish an integrative multistep multidisciplinary telehealth-based approach in a short while.","Dursun, Onur Burak; Turan, Bahadir; Gulsen, Murat; Karayagmurlu, Ali; Tugce Mustan, Aybuke; Kutlu, Ayse; Rodopman Arman, Ayse; Gokcen, Cem; Dogru, Hicran; Esin, Ibrahim Selcuk; Kaya, Ilyas; Coskun, Murat; Soylu, Nusret; Erbilgin, Seda; Tanır, Yasar",Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,https://doi.org/10.1089/tmj.2020.0380; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33232640/,101

We undertook a systematic review focused on older patients to assess the reasons underlying non-adherence in this population. Methods We searched multiple electronic databases for studies reporting reasons for non-adherence to medication regimens in patients aged 75 years and over. Our results were not limited to specific diseases, health-care settings, or geographical locations. The quality of eligible studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. A narrative synthesis of findings was performed. Results A total of 25 publications were included, all of which were in community settings. Frequent medication review and knowledge regarding the purpose of the medication were positively associated with adherence. Factors associated with poor adherence were multimorbidity, cognitive impairment, complex regimens with multiple prescribing physicians, and problems with drug storage or formulation. Conclusion These findings suggest that interventions to improve adherence could focus on medication review aimed at simplifying regimens and educating patients about their treatment. Groups with poor adherence that may benefit most from such a model include patients with multiple comorbidities and cognitive impairment.","Smaje, Ashley; Weston-Clark, Maryse; Raj, Ranjana; Orlu, Mine; Davis, Daniel; Rawle, Mark",Aging medicine (Milton (N.S.W)),https://doi.org/10.1002/agm2.12045; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31410389/,101
99170,Transforming health systems to reduce health inequalities.,2021-07-01,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES In recent years, 2 modifications of laparoscopic transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) inguinal hernia repair-needlescopic (nTAPP) surgery and single-port (sTAPP) surgery-have greatly improved patient outcomes over traditional approaches. For a comparison of these 2 modifications, we sought to investigate and compare the extent of surgical trauma and postoperative consequences for the abdominal wall in these two procedures. METHODS In a retrospective study, 50 nTAPP and 35 sTAPP procedures occurring at a community hospital from November 1, 2009, through July 31, 2012 were reviewed. Intraoperative data, including length of the umbilical skin incision and operative time, were recorded. A follow-up evaluation included investigation of hernia recurrence, postoperative pain, abdominal wall mobility, cosmetic satisfaction, and period of sick leave. RESULTS The mean umbilical skin incision was 13 ± 4 mm in nTAPP vs 27 ± 3 mm in sTAPP (P < .001). The nTAPP procedure required less operating time than the sTAPP procedure (54.8 ± 16.9 minutes vs 85.9 ± 19.7 minutes; P < .001). The mean immediate postoperative pain score on the visual analog scale was 2.7 ± 2.1 in the nTAPP group and 4.4 ± 1.9 in the sTAPP group (P = .016). In addition, patients who underwent nTAPP had a shorter period of sick leave (11.2 ± 8.4 days vs 24.1 ± 20.1 days; P = .02). At the follow-up evaluation after approximately 30 months, abdominal wall mobility and cosmetic satisfaction were equally positive, with no hernia recurrence. CONCLUSION In patients with uncomplicated inguinal hernia, the nTAPP procedure, with less surgical trauma and operating time, has distinct advantages in reduction of immediate postoperative pain and sick leave time.","Chan, Yi-Wei; Hollinsky, Christian",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,https://doi.org/10.4293/jsls.2015.00056; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26229421/,101

However, since tumor with invasion to the greater curvature and Type 4 tumor were excluded in JCOG0110, the benefit of splenectomy for these tumors is not known. METHODS A multicenter dataset of patients with gastric cancer who underwent gastrectomy between 2010 and 2014 was created. From the dataset, 114 eligible patients with proximal advanced gastric cancer with invasion to the greater curvature or Type 4 tumor were enrolled. There were 60 patients in the gastrectomy with splenectomy (Spx) group and 54 patients in the spleen-preserving (Prs) group. To balance the essential variables, propensity score analysis was performed, estimating the propensity score with a logistic regression model. Adjusted overall survival (OS) and adjusted disease-free survival (DFS) were estimated using the inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) method. RESULTS There were significant differences in age, performance status, comorbidity, macroscopic type, and clinical T stage between the Spx and Prs groups. The model for estimating the propensity score was well adapted (c-statistic: 0.830, 95%CI: 0.754-0.906). Adjusted OS was identical between the two groups (HR = 1.089, 95%CI: 0.759-1.563; p = 0.644). The DFS curve of Prs group was consistently tended to be lower than Spx, but the difference was not significant (HR = 0.813, 95%CI: 0.572-1.156; p = 0.249).

100469,Reimagining Global Health Governance in the Age of COVID-19.,2020-11-01,"BACKGROUND Tubulointerstitial fibrosis is a powerful predictor of future progression inimmunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy (IgAN). Proximal tubular epithelial cells (PTECs), in concert with infiltrating macrophages, are regarded as the agents provocateurs for driving this fibrotic process. However, evidence is now emerging for a contributory role of the distal nephron. The aim of this study was to examine the potential influence of macrophages on collecting duct epithelial cells (CDECs) and their combined role in the progression of IgAN. METHODS CDECs were cultured with macrophage-conditioned media (MCM) generated from human monocyte cell lines U937 and THP-1 stimulated with or without 100 μg/mL galactose-deficient IgA1. CDECs were analysed for evidence of inflammation and fibrosis. RESULTS Staining of IgAN biopsies for CD68+ macrophages revealed the presence of macrophages juxtaposed to collecting ducts and within their lumina. CDEC exposed to MCM from IgA1-stimulated THP-1 cells (THP-1-IgA-MCM) exhibited markedly increased expression of neutrophil-associated gelatinase (NGAL) and proinflammatory cytokinesinterleukin (IL)-1β, tumour necrosis factor-α, IL-6 and IL-8 compared with MCM from non-IgA-stimulated THP-1 cells (THP-1-MCM). U937-IgA-MCM increased fibronectin levels and reduced E-cadherinmRNA expression. THP-1-IgA-MCM-derived exosomes induced similar increases in NGAL and cytokine expression while in cross-over experiments exosomes extracted from IL-1β-exposed CDEC induced IL-1β and IL-6 mRNA expression in both sets of macrophages. MiRnome analysis revealed that microRNA (miR)-146a, -155 and -200b exhibited a >2-fold increase in expression in CDEC treated with THP-1-IgA-MCM compared with THP-1-MCM. Enforced miR-146a suppression further enhanced NGAL expression, while ectopic miR-146a over-expression downregulated it. NGAL mRNA and miR-146a were upregulated in the biopsies of patients with progressive IgAN compared with non-progressive IgAN. CONCLUSIONS Taken together, these data suggest that CDEC-macrophage interactions potentially contribute to the tubulointerstitial fibrosis characteristic of progressive IgAN.","Pawluczyk, Izabella Z A; Soares, Maria S F; Barratt, William A; Brown, Jeremy R; Bhachu, Jasraj S; Selvaskandan, Haresh; Zeng, Yiqing; Sarania, Rishi; Molyneux, Karen; Roberts, Ian S D; Barratt, Jonathan","Nephrology, dialysis, transplantation : official publication of the European Dialysis and Transplant Association - European Renal Association",https://doi.org/10.1093/ndt/gfaa079; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32830258/,101

OBJECTIVE To assess whether SARS-CoV-2 infection can affect sex-related hormones and testicular function in recovering patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS The patients were separately classified according to the duration of viral shedding (long-term positive vs normal-term group, with the former cases having a duration >50 days) and disease severity (moderate vs severe group). Differences in sex-related hormone levels were compared between groups and linear regression analysis was used to compare the associations of testosterone (T) and estradiol with various clinical and laboratory factors. RESULTS A total of 39 COVID-19 patients were included in this study. The mean T level was in the normal reference range while the mean estradiol level was above the normal limit. There were no significant differences between the long-term positive and normal-term groups in T (p=0.964), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH; p=0.694), luteinizing hormone (LH; p=0.171), prolactin (PRL; p=0.836) or T/LH (p=0.512). However, estradiol was higher in the normal-term group than the long-term positive group (p<0.001). Moreover, there were also no significant differences between the moderate and severe groups in sex-related hormones, duration of viral shedding, or serum biochemical or inflammation indicators. Additionally, regression analyses showed that there were no associations between the T level and the clinical and laboratory factors, while estradiol was negatively associated with the duration of viral shedding. CONCLUSION In males infected with SARS-CoV-2, most sex-related hormones (T, FSH and LH levels) remain within the normal reference ranges after recovery from COVID-19, and no significant associations were observed between T level and disease duration or severity. At present, there is insufficient evidence to show that SARS-CoV-2 causes hypogonadism and sterility, but the potential risk should not be ignored.","Xu, Hui; Wang, Zhixian; Feng, Chunxiang; Yu, Weiwei; Chen, Yuan; Zeng, Xiaoyong; Liu, Chang",Andrology,https://doi.org/10.1111/andr.12942; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33152165/,101

Exonuclease activity enables the RdRp complex to remove wrongly incorporated bases via proofreading, a process not utilized by other RNA viruses. However, it is unclear why the RdRp complex needs proofreading and what the associated trade-offs are. Here we investigate the interplay among the accuracy, speed, and energetic cost of proofreading in the RdRp complex using a kinetic model and bioinformatics analysis. We find that proofreading nearly optimizes the rate of functional virus production. However, we find that further optimization would lead to a significant increase in the proofreading cost. Unexpected importance of the cost minimization is further supported by other global analyses. We speculate that cost optimization could help avoid cell defense responses. Thus, proofreading is essential for the production of functional viruses, but its rate is limited by energy costs.","Mallory, Joel D; Mallory, Xian F; Kolomeisky, Anatoly B; Igoshin, Oleg A",The journal of physical chemistry letters,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpclett.1c00190; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33689357/,101

Thus, the question of the present work is whether the technical and procedural differences of thrombectomy techniques lead to different technical and clinical results. METHODS AND RESULTS Analysis of a mixed retrospective/prospective database of all endovascular treated patients with an occlusion of the Carotid-T or M1 segment of the MCA at a single comprehensive stroke center since 2008. Patients were classified regarding the technical approach used. Six hundred sixty-eight patients were available for the final analysis. Reperfusion rates ranged between 56% and 100% depending on the technical approach. The use of balloon guide catheters and most recently the establishment of combination techniques using balloon guide catheters, aspiration catheters and stent retrievers have shown a further significant increase in the rates of successful recanalization, full recanalization and first-pass recanalization. Additionally, the technical development of interventional techniques has led to a subsequent drop in complications, embolization into previously unaffected territories in particular.

As a part of the global response to manage and contain the pandemic, major emphasis was placed on generating research intelligence to guide evidence-based responses to contain the virus, which was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), owing to its genetic similarities with the SARS virus. This review summarizes the emerging evidence which can help guide the public health response, particularly in India. Key areas have been identified in which research needs to be conducted to generate critical intelligence for advising prevention and control efforts. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has once again exposed the weaknesses of global health systems preparedness, ability to respond to an infectious threat, the rapidity of transmission of infections across international borders and the ineffectiveness of knee-jerk policy responses to emerging/re-emerging infectious disease threats. The review concludes with the key learning points from the ongoing efforts to prevent and contain COVID-19 and identifies the need to invest in health systems, community-led response mechanisms and the need for preparedness and global health security.","Chatterjee, Pranab; Nagi, Nazia; Agarwal, Anup; Das, Bhabatosh; Banerjee, Sayantan; Sarkar, Swarup; Gupta, Nivedita; Gangakhedkar, Raman R",The Indian journal of medical research,https://doi.org/10.4103/ijmr.ijmr_519_20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32242874/,101

Parameters of the effectiveness of surgery and complications were informed by data from the UK National Bariatric Surgery Registry, the Scandinavian Obesity Registry and the Swedish Obese Subjects study. Costs and utilities were informed by UK sources. RESULTS Bariatric surgery was associated with reduced mean costs to the health service by €2742 (£1944), and gain of 0·8 life-years and 4·0 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) over a lifetime compared with usual care. Bariatric surgery also had the potential to reduce the lifetime risks of obesity-related cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. Delaying surgery for up to 3 years resulted in a reduction of 0·7 QALYs and a minor decrease of €2058 (£1459) in associated healthcare costs.

Thus, the aim of the present study was to synthesize physiological and symptomatic responses during activities involving the arms relative to activities involving the legs in people with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). Any study with a cross-sectional comparison of acute physiological (cardiorespiratory, metabolic) and symptomatic responses to activities performed with the arms versus the legs were included. Studies were sub-grouped based on the type of activity performed (cycle ergometer, resistance exercises, or functional test/activities). Eighteen studies with 423 individuals with COPD were included. Leg cycle ergometer resulted in greater tidal volume (137 mL), minute ventilation (4.8 L/min), and oxygen consumption (164 mL/min) than arm cycle ergometer, while symptomatic responses were similar. Resistance exercises resulted in similar physiological and symptomatic responses irrespective of whether the legs or the arms were involved while studies on functional activities report different results depending on the type and intensity of the activity performed. With the exception of cycle ergometer activities, physiological and symptomatic responses do not seem to depend on whether the arms or the legs are used, but rather seem to be task and intensity dependent. These novel findings suggest, for example, that strategies used to increase exercise tolerance should not be dependent on whether the arms or the legs are used, but rather the intensity of specific activity performed.","Frykholm, Erik; Lima, Vanessa Pereira; Selander, Hanna-Vega; Nyberg, Andre; Janaudis-Ferreira, Tania",COPD,https://doi.org/10.1080/15412555.2019.1674269; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31631711/,101

This fMRI study assessed the extent to which early adolescents (n = 39, ages 12-14) conform to their parents' and peers' conflicting attitudes toward different types of behavior (unconstructive and constructive) and in response to different types of influence (negative and positive). Overall, adolescents exhibited low rates of conformity, sticking with their pre-existing attitudes 65 % of the time. When they did conform, adolescents were more likely to conform to their peers' attitudes towards constructive than unconstructive behaviors, exhibiting decreased activation in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, insula, and inferior frontal gyrus during peer conformity toward constructive over unconstructive behaviors. Adolescents were also more likely to conform when their parents and peers endorsed relatively more positive influence than negative influence, exhibiting increased activation in the temporoparietal junction when considering conforming to negative over positive influence. These results highlight early adolescents' ability to stick with their own opinions when confronted with opposing attitudes and conform selectively based on the social context.","Do, Kathy T; McCormick, Ethan M; Telzer, Eva H",Developmental cognitive neuroscience,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dcn.2020.100837; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32830094/,101
108727,Are We Ready For The Next Pandemic?,2020-06-01,"PURPOSE Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) was first identified in December 2019 with millions of cases reported globally in the succeeding months. Initial hospitalisation strives to minimise multisystem organ failure and of those that survive, individuals can present with profound rehabilitation needs. The purpose of this case series is to describe occupational therapy (OT) and special technology considerations for three male Veteran patients hospitalised with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. Methods: This is a descriptive case series using a retrospective electronic health record review at a Veterans Administration hospital. The case series includes three male Veterans with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 (ages 69-78) who were referred to OT. The cases were selected to demonstrate the novel use of technology and strategies to reduce the risk of transmission. In two of three of our cases, we describe acute rehabilitation with a focus on activity tolerance, participation in occupations, and discharge planning. In all cases, we measured vital signs and activity tolerance as primary outcomes. Results and conclusions: The findings suggest that outcome measures focussing on activity tolerance to maintain stable vital signs during the recovery phase is central to the progression of activities. We observed in our cases that the Person-Environment-Occupation-Performance (PEOP) model can guide practice and complement the medical model in management of these patients. We utilised technology to engage family members in the rehabilitation care and minimise exposure risks. IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION Acute occupational therapy for rehabilitation early in the recovery of Cornavirus-2019 can be guided by the Person-Occupation-Environment-Performance model as seen in this case series of three Veteran patients. Assistive technology can serve dual roles in supporting the rehabilitation of individuals with Cornavirus-2019 and lowering the risk of virus transmission to staff.","Rich, Tonya; Hicks, Brandon; Dahl, Abigail; Sullivan, Elle; Barrett, Benjamin; Bedore, Beau",Disability and rehabilitation.

This task is challenging to achieve without the inclusion of a strong and safe mucosal adjuvant. Previously, inulin acetate (InAc), a plant-based polymer, is shown to activate toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) and elicit a robust systemic immune response as a vaccine adjuvant. This study investigates the potential of nanoparticles prepared with InAc (InAc-NPs) as an intranasal vaccine delivery system to generate both mucosal and systemic immune responses. InAc-NPs (∼250 nm in diameter) activated wild-type (WT) macrophages but failed to activate macrophages from TLR4 knockout mice or WT macrophages when pretreated with a TLR4 antagonist (lipopolysaccharide-RS (LPS-RS)), which indicates the selective nature of a InAc-based nanodelivery system as a TLR4 agonist. Intranasal immunization using antigen-loaded InAc-NPs generated ∼65-fold and 19-fold higher serum IgG1 and IgG2a titers against the antigen, respectively, as compared to PLGA-NPs as a delivery system. InAc-NPs have also stimulated the secretion of sIgA at various mucosal sites, including nasal-associated lymphoid tissues (NALTs), lungs, and intestine, and produced a strong memory response indicative of both humoral and cellular immune activation. Overall, by stimulating both systemic and mucosal immunity, InAc-NPs laid a basis for a potential intranasal delivery system for mucosal vaccination.","Bakkari, Mohammed Ali; Valiveti, Chaitanya K; Kaushik, Radhey S; Tummala, Hemachand",Molecular pharmaceutics,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.0c01256; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34010002/,101

However, the estimations of the basic reproduction number of COVID-19 varied greatly across studies. The objectives of this study are 1) to estimate the basic reproduction number (R(0)) of COVID-19 reflecting the infectiousness of the virus and 2) to assess the effectiveness of a range of controlling intervention. Method: The reported number of daily confirmed cases from January 17 to February 8, 2020 in Hubei province were collected and used for model fit. Four methods, the exponential growth (EG), maximum likelihood estimation (ML), sequential Bayesian method (SB) and time dependent reproduction numbers (TD), were applied to estimate the R(0). Result: Among the four methods, the EG method fitted the data best. The estimated R(0) was 3.49 (95% CI: 3.42-3.58) by using EG method. The R(0) was estimated to be 2.95 (95%CI: 2.86-3.03) after taking control measures. Conclusion: In the early stage of the epidemic, it is appropriate to estimate R(0) using the EG method. Meanwhile, timely and effective control measures were warranted to further reduce the spread of COVID-19.","Wang, Y; You, X Y; Wang, Y J; Peng, L P; Du, Z C; Gilmour, S; Yoneoka, D; Gu, J; Hao, C; Hao, Y T; Li, J H",Zhonghua liu xing bing xue za zhi = Zhonghua liuxingbingxue zazhi,https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn112338-20200210-00086; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32125128/,101

STUDY DESIGN We analyzed the clinical impact of preemptive thoracic drainage in 177 patients undergoing adult-to-adult LDLT for chronic liver diseases at a single center. Recipients were divided into 2 time periods. The earlier cohort (n = 120) was analyzed for risk factors for postoperative atelectasis retrospectively; the later cohort (n = 57), with a risk factor for postoperative atelectasis, underwent preemptive thoracic drainage prospectively. The incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications was compared between these 2 cohorts. RESULTS Independent risk factors for atelectasis in earlier cohort were body mass index ≥27 kg/m(2) (p < 0.001), performance status ≥3 (p = 0.003) and model for end-stage liver disease score ≥23 (p = 0.005). The rates of atelectasis (21.1% vs 42.5%, p = 0.005) and pneumonia (1.8% vs 10.0%, p = 0.049) were significantly lower in later than in earlier cohort. Moreover, the mean durations of ICU stay (3.6 ± 0.2 days vs 5.7 ± 0.6 days, p = 0.038) and postoperative oxygen support (5.1 ± 0.8 days vs 7.1 ± 0.5 days, p = 0.037) were significantly shorter in the later than in the earlier cohort. There were no significant differences in the incidence of adverse events associated with thoracic drainages between these 2 cohorts. CONCLUSIONS Preemptive thoracic drainage for transplant recipients at high risk of postoperative atelectasis could decrease morbidities after LDLT.","Imai, Daisuke; Ikegami, Toru; Toshima, Takeo; Yoshizumi, Tomoharu; Yamashita, Yo-ichi; Ninomiya, Mizuki; Harimoto, Norifumi; Itoh, Shinji; Uchiyama, Hideaki; Shirabe, Ken; Maehara, Yoshihiko",Journal of the American College of Surgeons,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2014.09.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25458236/,101

Despite this high diversity, similar or identical TCR chains are found to recur in immune responses. Here, we analyzed the thymic generation of TCR sequences previously associated with recognition of self- and nonself-antigens, represented by sequences associated with autoimmune diabetes and HIV, respectively. Unexpectedly, in the CD4+ compartment TCRα chains associated with the recognition of self-antigens were generated in significantly higher numbers than TCRα chains associated with the recognition of nonself-antigens. The analysis of the circulating repertoire further showed that these chains are not lost in negative selection nor predominantly converted to the regulatory T-cell lineage. The high abundance of self-reactive TCRα chains in multiple individuals suggests that the human thymus has a predilection to generate self-reactive TCRα chains independently of the HLA-type and that the individual risk of autoimmunity may be modulated by the TCRβ repertoire associated with these chains.","Heikkilä, Nelli; Sormunen, Silja; Mattila, Joonatan; Härkönen, Taina; Knip, Mikael; Ihantola, Emmi-Leena; Kinnunen, Tuure; Mattila, Ilkka P; Saramäki, Jari; Arstila, T Petteri",Journal of autoimmunity,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaut.2021.102616; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33652347/,101
114662,Political interference in public health science during covid-19.,2020-10-06,"INTRODUCTION Barbed suture devices have a widespread application in plastic surgery. The unidirectional nature of the barbs facilitates a strong grip on tissues and reduces the need to constantly tension the suture manually. We hypothesized that a barbed suture tie-over suture to secure skin grafts would be quicker to perform than traditional tie-overs and would also exert a greater downward pressure on the skin graft. METHODS Thirty uniform areas of skin were excised from a cadaver. A pressure transducer was placed on the wound bed and covered with the excised skin along with a mineral oil-soaked wool dressing to act as a bolster. Three different sutures were used to secure the graft in place and the pressure was recorded. The tie-over techniques used were the classic silk tie-over, a running Vicryl Rapide™ tie-over and a running barbed tie-over. RESULTS The barbed tie-over exerted the most downward pressure (82.8 ± 7.3 mmHg) compared to the silk (46 ± 4.85 mmHg) and the Vicryl Rapide™ (18.6 ± 2.4 mmHg). Furthermore, the barbed tie-over was the quickest to perform (1:45 ± 22 s) when compared to the Vicryl Rapide™ (02:57 ± 27 s) and the silk tie-overs (04:26 ± 39 s). CONCLUSION Barbed sutures are a viable option for securing skin grafts. They are quick to perform and provide significantly improved downward pressure on the skin graft. We feel that this technique would be especially suited to the sole operator as it can be carried out without the need of an assistant.","Joyce, C W; Joyce, K M; Mahon, N; Chan, J C; Sugrue, C M; Dockery, P; Carroll, S M; Kelly, J L","Journal of plastic, reconstructive & aesthetic surgery : JPRAS",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bjps.2014.05.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24908547/,101

MATERIALS AND METHODS We conducted a retrospective analysis of a procedural database. All aneurysm procedures using any of the three types of self-expanding nitinol stents (NEU, EP and LVIS/LVIS Jr) were included. Intra-procedure complications, post-procedure complications, and angiographic results (Raymond-Roy grade scale, RRGS) were analyzed retrospectively. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify predictors of intra-procedure and post-procedure complications. RESULTS Two hundred and forty-three aneurysms in 229 patients treated with stent-assisted coiling were included (NEU group: 109 aneurysms; EP group: 61 aneurysms; LVIS/LVIS Jr: 73 aneurysms). The LVIS/LVIS Jr group was associated with the lowest rate of initial complete occlusion (RRGS I: 47.9%; 35/73). Follow-up showed the proportion of RRGS I increased for all stent groups but was greatest in the LVIS/LVIS Jr group. Overall, 17 intra-procedural complications were seen in 229 patients (7.4%) and 15 post-procedural complications were found in 198 patients at follow-up (7.6%), with no differences between stent groups. Thrombotic events were the most common complications and occurred in 13 patients (13/229, 5.7%). CONCLUSIONS All three types of stents used to treat cerebral aneurysms with unfavorable neck were safe and effective, providing suitable support for the coil mass. LVIS/LVIS Jr promotes better progressive aneurysm complete occlusion than the other two stents but seems to cause more common intra-procedural stent-related thrombotic events and fewer post-procedural complications.","Wang, Jun; Vargas, Jan; Spiotta, Alejandro; Chaudry, Imran; Turner, Raymond D; Lena, Jonathan; Turk, Aquilla",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2017-013272; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29146831/,101

Eating kaolin clay as a type of pica has been examined as an alternative behavior to emesis. Here, we evaluated changes in whole-transcriptome analysis in the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) in a rat pica model as a surrogate behavior of PONV to elucidate the molecular genetic mechanisms of the development of PONV and the involvement of the catecholamine system in the NTS. First, kaolin pica behaviors were investigated in 71 female Wistar rats following isoflurane anesthesia, surgical insult, or morphine administration. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that 3 mg/kg morphine increased kaolin intake by 2.8 g (p = 0.0002). Next, total RNA and protein were extracted from the dissected NTS, and whole-transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed to identify PONV-associated genes and to verify the involvement of the catecholamine system. The gene expression levels of tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine beta-hydroxylase in the catecholamine biosynthesis pathway decreased significantly in the PONV model. Release of noradrenaline, a catecholamine pathway end product, may have increased at the synaptic terminal of the NTS neuron after pica behavior. Systematic administration of α2 adrenergic receptor agonists after surgery reduced kaolin intake from 3.2 g (control) to 1.0 g (p = 0.0014). These results indicated that catecholamine neurotransmission was involved in the development of PONV in the NTS.","Sugino, Shigekazu; Konno, Daisuke; Abe, Junko; Imamura-Kawasawa, Yuka; Kido, Kanta; Suzuki, Jun; Endo, Yasuhiro; Yamauchi, Masanori","Genes, brain, and behavior",https://doi.org/10.1111/gbb.12759; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34114352/,101

The endocytosis required for EV71 entry were investigated in Jurkat T and mouse L929 cells constitutively expressing human PSGL-1 (PSGL-1-L929) or human rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cells displaying high SCARB2 but no PSGL-1 by treatment of specific inhibitors or siRNA. We found that disruption of clathrin-dependent endocytosis prevented EV71 infection in RD cells, while there was no influence in Jurkat T and PSGL-1-L929 cells. Disturbing caveolar endocytosis by specific inhibitor or caveolin-1 siRNA in Jurkat T and PSGL-1-L929 cells significantly blocked EV71 infection, whereas it had no effect on EV71 infection in RD cells. Confocal immunofluorescence demonstrated caveola, and EV71 was directly colocalized. pH-dependent endosomal acidification and intact membrane cholesterol were important for EV71 infection, as judged by the pretreatment of inhibitors that abrogated the infection. A receptor-dominated endocytosis of EV71 infection was observed: PSGL-1 initiates caveola-dependent endocytosis and hSCARB2 activates clathrin-dependent endocytosis.","Lin, Hsiang-Yin; Yang, Ya-Ting; Yu, Shu-Ling; Hsiao, Kuang-Nan; Liu, Chia-Chyi; Sia, Charles; Chow, Yen-Hung",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00573-13; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23760234/,101
124242,The constitutional economics of the World Health Organization.,2020-08-03,"BACKGROUND Nivolumab is a programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) receptor inhibitor antibody that enhances immune system antitumor activity. It is associated with longer overall survival (OS) than the standard treatment of docetaxel in patients with previously treated advanced squamous (SQ) and non-squamous (non-SQ) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We previously conducted two phase II studies of nivolumab in Japanese patients with SQ (ONO-4538-05) and non-SQ (ONO-4538-06) NSCLC, showing overall response rates (ORRs) (95% CI) of 25.7% (14.2-42.1) and 22.4% (14.5-32.9), respectively, with acceptable toxicity. In this analysis, we more precisely estimated the long-term safety and efficacy in patients with SQ and non-SQ NSCLC by pooling data from these two trials. METHODS SQ (N = 35) and non-SQ (N = 76) NSCLC patients received nivolumab (3 mg/kg, every 2 weeks) until progression or discontinuation. OS was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. A pooled analysis of SQ and non-SQ patients was also performed. RESULTS In SQ NSCLC patients, the median OS (95% CI) was 16.3 months (12.4-25.2), and the estimated 1-year, 2-year, and 3-year survival rates were 71.4% (53.4-83.5), 37.1% (21.6-52.7), and 20.0% (8.8-34.4), respectively. In non-SQ NSCLC patients, median OS was 17.1 months (13.3-23.0), and the estimated 1-, 2-, and 3-year survival rates were 68.0% (56.2-77.3), 37.4% (26.5-48.1), and 31.9% (21.7-42.5), respectively. When SQ NSCLC and non-SQ NSCLC data were pooled, the median OS was 17.1 months (14.2-20.6), and the estimated 1-, 2-, and 3-year survival rates were 69.1% (59.6-76.8), 37.3% (28.3-46.2), and 28.1% (20.0-36.7), respectively. Twenty (76.9%) of 26 responders lived for 3 or more years. Nivolumab was well tolerated and no new safety signals were found. CONCLUSION Treatment with nivolumab improved long-term survival and was well tolerated in patients with SQ and non-SQ NSCLC.

This study fabricated a fiber-based optical coherence tomography (OCT) catheter and investigated its potential for assessing the Eustachian tube anatomy. A customized OCT system and an imaging catheter, termed the Eustachian OCT, were developed for visualizing the Eustachian tube. Three male swine cadaver heads were used to study OCT image acquisition and for subsequent histologic correlation. The imaging catheter was introduced through the nasopharyngeal opening and reached toward the middle ear. The OCT images were acquired from the superior to the nasopharyngeal opening before and after Eustachian tube balloon dilatation. The histological anatomy of the Eustachian tube was compared with corresponding OCT images, The new, Eustachian OCT catheter was successfully inserted in the tubal lumen without damage. Cross-sectional images of the tube were successfully obtained, and the margins of the anatomical structures including cartilage, mucosa lining, and fat could be successfully delineated. After balloon dilatation, the expansion of the cross-sectional area could be identified from the OCT images. Using the OCT technique to assess the Eustachian tube anatomy was shown to be feasible, and the fabricated OCT image catheter was determined to be suitable for Eustachian tube assessment.","Byun, Hayoung; Kim, Yeon Hoon; Xing, Jingchao; Shin, Su-Jin; Lee, Seung Hwan; Yoo, Hongki; Chung, Jae Ho",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-85634-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33737591/,101

This prevents the recruitment of capped cellular mRNA; however, the viral RNA can be translated under these conditions. The two other mechanisms are the induction of NF-κB cleavage and the deubiquitination of immune signalling molecules.

The past decade has seen a large exodus of Venezuelans within Latin America, including Chile. In the past months, the world has been facing the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus pandemic and its respiratory disease COVID-19. Objective To explore what factors are associated with feeling prepared to face the COVID-19 pandemic among the Venezuelan population residing in Chile. Methods Cross-sectional quantitative study with an opinion poll design. An online self-reported survey in Spanish and Creole was designed and piloted with experts and international migrants. It was disseminated to various international migrant groups through networks of migrant and pro-migrant organizations and the Chilean public health care network across the national territory. An effective sample size for analysis of 1690 participants was reached, of which 1008 (60%) were from Venezuela and included in this analysis. Feeling prepared to face the COVID-19 pandemic (yes/no) among Venezuelan migrants was described, as well as relevant variables like sex, level of education, length of stay, healthcare provision, anxiety or depression due to COVID-19, confinement, and evaluation of the quality of the information provided by the COVID-19 government. Results 65% of the Venezuelan participants reported not feeling prepared for the pandemic. Compared to Venezuelan migrants who feel prepared to face the COVID-19 pandemic, migrants who reported not feeling prepared were in a higher proportion female, with secondary education level, had arrived in Chile in the past year, do not have a job but want to work, and belong to the public healthcare provision. Discussion Receiving good quality information on the pandemic and mental health symptoms are important factors associated with feeling prepared to face COVID-19 in Venezuelan migrants in Chile, suggesting that increased attention towards the physical and mental health of Venezuelan migrants in Chile and the region is needed.","Cabieses, Báltica; Darrigrandi, Florencia; Blukacz, Alice; Obach, Alexandra; Silva, Claudia",Medwave,https://doi.org/10.5867/medwave.2021.01.8103; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33617522/,101

131564,Prescribing Housing: A Scoping Review of Health System Efforts to Address Housing as a Social Determinant of Health.,2020-08-17,"BACKGROUND The COVID-19 pandemic has led to an increased demand for mechanical ventilators and concerns of a ventilator shortage. Several groups have advocated for 1 ventilator to ventilate 2 or more patients in the event of such a shortage. However, differences in patient lung mechanics could make sharing a ventilator detrimental to both patients. Our previous study indicated failure to ventilate in 67% of simulations. The safety problems that must be solved include individual control of tidal volume (VT), individual measurement of VT, individualization of PEEP settings, and individual PEEP measurement. The purpose of this study was to evaluate potential solutions developed at our institution. METHODS Two separate lung simulators were ventilated with a modified multiplex circuit using pressure control ventilation. Parameters of the lung models used for simulations (resistance and compliance) were evidence-based from published studies. Individual circuit-modification devices were first evaluated for accuracy. Devices were an adjustable flow diverter valve, a prototype dual volume display, a PEEP valve, and a disposable PEEP display. Then the full modified multiplex circuit was assessed by ventilating 6 pairs of simulated patients with different lung models and attempting to equalize ventilation. Ventilation was considered equalized when VT and end-expiratory lung volume were within 10% for each simulation. RESULTS The adjustable flow diverter valve allowed volume adjustment to 1 patient without affecting the other. The average error of the dual volume display was -17%. The PEEP valves individualized PEEP, but the PEEP gauge error ranged from 17% to 41%. Using the multiplex circuit, ventilation was equalized regardless of differences in resistance or compliance, reversing the ""failure modes"" of our previous study. CONCLUSIONS The results of this simulation-based study indicate that devices for individual control and display of VT and PEEP are effective in extending the usability and potential patient safety of multiplex ventilation.","Sorg, Morgan E; Branson, Richard D; Hatipoğlu, Umur; Chatburn, Robert L",Respiratory care,https://doi.org/10.4187/respcare.08749; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33906955/,101

In this prospective randomized study, a hyaluronan-based hydrogel with BMP-2 was used to achieve bone healing in standardized critical-size cranial defects in humans after neurosurgery. METHODS Twelve patients were randomized into the treatment group (N = 6) or control group (N = 6). In the treatment group, holes made during craniotomy were treated with hydrogel with BMP-2, 250 µg/mL, or hydrogel without BMP-2. In the remaining hole/s in the same patient, Spongostan (Ethicon) alone or Tisseel (Baxter) mixed with autologous bone matrix were used as negative and positive controls, respectively. In the control group, the holes were treated with Spongostan or Tisseel mixed with bone autograft. Bone healing was assessed with CT scans after 3 and 6 months. Bone areas in treated defects were measured and statistical analysis was performed. RESULTS Independent of location, bone healing in defects treated with Tisseel with autograft, hydrogel alone, or hydrogel with BMP-2 was significantly increased compared to negative control (P < 0.001, P = 0.002, and P = 0.005, respectively). In general, all defects healed significantly better in the frontal bone as compared to parietal-temporal location, except for defects treated with Tisseel and autograft, which healed well independently of location. No local or systemic side effects, including excessive bone overgrowth or inflammatory reaction, were seen in treated patients. CONCLUSIONS Tissue engineering of bone with hyaluronan-based hydrogel shows good healing of cranial defects, comparable with bone autografts. The hydrogel itself may represent a novel alternative to autologous bone transplants in craniofacial bone repair. The study also reveals a general superior healing capacity in the frontal bone as compared to parietal/temporal bones.","Skogh, Ann-Charlott Docherty; Kihlström, Lars; Neovius, Erik; Persson, Cecilia; Beckman, Mats O; Engstrand, Thomas",The Journal of craniofacial surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/scs.0b013e31827ff2b6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23524688/,101

METHODS The study included liveborn twin and singleton pregnancies between January 2000 and January 2019. Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) included gestational hypertension and pre-eclampsia. The study outcomes were FGR or small-for-gestational-age (SGA) at birth as assessed using singleton and twin reference charts. RESULTS The analysis included 1473 twin and 62,432 singleton pregnancies. In singleton pregnancies the risk of PTB <34 weeks without HDP (OR 2.82, p < 0.001), delivery ≥34 weeks with HDP (OR 2.38, p < 0.001), and PTB <34 weeks with HDP (OR 13.65, p < 0.001) were significantly higher in the pregnancies complicated by FGR compared to those without. When selective fetal growth restriction (sFGR) was assessed using the singleton standard, the risk of PTB <34 weeks without HDP (OR 1.03, p = 0.872), delivery ≥34 weeks with HDP (OR 1.36, p = 0.160) were similar in the pregnancies complicated by sFGR compared to those without, while the risk of PTB <34 weeks with HDP (OR 2.41, p = 0.025) was significantly higher in the pregnancies complicated by sFGR compared to those without. When sFGR was assessed using the twin-specific chart, the risk of PTB <34 weeks without HDP (OR 3.55, p < 0.001), delivery ≥34 weeks with HDP (OR 3.17, p = 0.004), and PTB <34 weeks with HDP (OR 5.69, p < 0.001) were significantly higher in the pregnancies complicated by sFGR compared to those without. The stronger and more consistent association persisted in the subgroup analyses according to chorionicity. The strength of association in dichorionic twin pregnancies resembles that of the singletons more closely and consistently when the FGR was diagnosed using the twin-specific charts. CONCLUSION FGR in twin pregnancies has a stronger and more consistent association with HDP and PTB when using twin-specific rather than singleton charts. This study provides further evidence supporting the use of twin-specific charts when assessing fetal growth in twin pregnancies.","Kalafat, Erkan; Abiola, Aisha; Thilaganathan, Basky; Bhide, Amar; Khalil, Asma",Journal of clinical medicine,https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm9082518; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764227/,101
138607,The HIV Pandemic Prevention Efforts Can Inform the COVID-19 Pandemic Response in the United States.,2021-04-01,"PURPOSE Biologic grafts are rarely used for inguinal herniorrhaphy. The aim of this study was to compare the clinical outcomes between patients undergoing a Lichtenstein's hernioplasty with a porcine mesh versus a standard synthetic. METHODS A prospective, randomized, double-blinded multicenter, evaluation of inguinal hernia repair was conducted between 2008 and 2010. Lichtenstein hernioplasty was performed using Strattice™ or lightweight polypropylene (Ultrapro) mesh. Quality of life, pain, overall complication rate, and recurrence were measured. RESULTS One hundred and seventy-two patients were randomized to Strattice™ (n = 84) or Ultrapro (n = 88). At 3 months postoperatively, there were no differences on the occurrence or type of wound events [RR: 0.98 (95% CI 0.52-1.86, p = 0.69), Strattice™ (15 events) vs. Ultrapro (16 events)]. The mean level of impairment caused by the hernia, assessed by Activities Assessment Scale (AAS), significantly decreased postoperatively in both groups at 3 months (31% Strattice™ and 37% Ultrapro). Patients in the Strattice group reported significantly less postoperative pain during postoperative days 1 through 3 compared to Ultrapro patients. However, the amount of postoperative pain at 3 months, as assessed by the mean worst pain score on a visual analog scale and the Brief Pain Index, was similar between groups (95% CI 1.0-29.3). No hernia recurrences were observed in either group. CONCLUSIONS Strattice™ is safe and effective in repairing inguinal hernia, with comparable intra-operative and early postoperative morbidity to synthetic mesh. Long-term follow-up is necessary in order to know whether the clinical outcomes of Strattice are equivalent to standard synthetic mesh in patients undergoing Lichtenstein's hernioplasty.","Bellows, C F; Shadduck, P; Helton, W S; Martindale, R; Stouch, B C; Fitzgibbons, R",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10029-013-1076-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23543334/,101

The primary outcome was the proportion of stage N3 sleep over total sleep time. Secondary outcomes were other descriptors of sleep and major outcome variables. RESULTS In the intervention group, nine (30%) patients did not wear earplugs all night long. The proportion of N3 sleep was 21 [7-28]% in the intervention group and 11 [3-23]% in the control group (p = 0.09). The duration of N3 sleep was higher among the patients in the intervention group who wore earplugs all night long than in the control group (74 [32-106] vs. 31 [7-76] minutes, p = 0.039). The number of prolonged awakenings was smaller in the intervention group (21 [19-26] vs. 31 [21-47] in the control group, p = 0.02). No significant difference was observed between the two groups in terms of clinical outcome variables. CONCLUSIONS Earplugs and eye mask reduce long awakenings and increase N3 duration when they are well tolerated. TRIAL REGISTRATION ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02292134 .

139858,Coronavirus: A trigger for OCD and illness anxiety disorder?,2020-06-04,"BACKGROUND In recent years, increasingly sophisticated tools have allowed for more complex robotic surgery. Robotic hepatectomy, however, is still in its infancy. Our goals were to examine the adoption of robotic hepatectomy and to compare outcomes between open and robotic liver resections. METHODS The robotic hepatectomy experience of 64 patients was compared to a modern case-matched series of 64 open hepatectomy patients at the same center. Matching was according to benign/malignant diagnosis and number of segments resected. Patient data were obtained retrospectively. The main outcomes and measures were operative time, estimated blood loss, conversion rate (robotic to open), Pringle maneuver use, single non-anatomic wedge resection rate, resection margin size, complication rates (infectious, hepatic, pulmonary, cardiac), hospital stay length, ICU stay length, readmission rate, and 90-day mortality rate. RESULTS Sixty-four robotic hepatectomies were performed in 2010-2014. Forty-one percent were segmental and 34 % were wedge resections. There was a 6 % conversion rate, a 3 % 90-day mortality rate, and an 11 % morbidity rate. Compared to 64 matched patients who underwent open hepatectomy (2004-2012), there was a shorter median OR time (p = 0.02), lower median estimated blood loss (p < 0.001), and shorter median hospital stay (p < 0.001). Eleven of the robotic cases were isolated resections of tumors in segments 2, 7, and 8. CONCLUSIONS Robotic hepatectomy is safe and effective. Increasing experience in more centers will allow definition of which hepatectomies can be performed robotically, and will enable optimization of outcomes and prospective examination of the economic cost of each approach.","Kingham, T Peter; Leung, Universe; Kuk, Deborah; Gönen, Mithat; D'Angelica, Michael I; Allen, Peter J; DeMatteo, Ronald P; Laudone, Vincent P; Jarnagin, William R; Fong, Yuman",World journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00268-016-3446-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26913732/,101

METHODS Professional surgical society websites were searched for publicly available statements and policies related to gender equity. These were compiled and assessed for critical components. RESULTS Publicly available statements/policies were published in every surgical society, though few pertained specifically to gender. Nearly all were recently written or revised. The most common statement/policy addressed discrimination and harassment. The only policies/statements that reliably contained all four key components pertained to professional conduct at national meetings. All policies that provided consequences also contained specific reporting processes. CONCLUSIONS Gender equity statements and policies are deficient among professional surgical societies.

The incursion and spread of a disease such as African swine fever (ASF), which emerged in Eastern Europe in 2007, could have devastating socioeconomic consequences for both the Chinese and the global pig industry. The Chinese government consequently attributes a very high priority to ASF and is actively seeking to improve its preparedness. This paper discusses different drivers and pathways of potential emergence of ASF in China in light of the country's specificities, including international movements of people, pigs and pig products, swill feeding practices and wild boar populations. It suggests that effective ASF risk management in China will require a comprehensive and integrated approach linking science and policy and will need to involve all relevant stakeholders to develop realistic policies.","Vergne, Timothée; Chen-Fu, Cao; Li, Shuo; Cappelle, Julien; Edwards, John; Martin, Vincent; Pfeiffer, Dirk Udo; Fusheng, Guo; Roger, Francois Louis",The Veterinary record,https://doi.org/10.1136/vr.103950; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28754737/,101

As the global burden of obesity and its comorbidities has increased, it is evident that novel therapeutic approaches will be necessary to address the obesity epidemic. EBTs offer greater efficacy than diet and lifestyle modification and lower invasiveness than bariatric surgery. The US Food and Drug Administration has approved two intragastric balloons and aspiration therapy for the treatment of obesity: Apollo Orbera is indicated for the treatment of Class I and Class II obesity, Re Shape Integrated Dual Balloon system is indicated for the same range with a comorbidity, and Aspire Bariatrics AspireAssist is approved for patients with a body mass index of 35-55 kg/m2. These devices have proven safe and effective in clinical trials and are gaining commercial acceptance in the USA; the Orbera has been used extensively outside the USA for over 20 years. These devices will need to be delivered in the context of a multidisciplinary weight loss program, integrating comprehensive care of obesity. Patient selection is important, and ensuring appropriate patient expectations and understanding of alternatives such as pharmacologic therapy and surgery is essential.

A wireless, easy-to-use, and comfortable method for monitoring these important clinical signs would be highly useful. We investigated whether the Nellcor™ OxiMask MAX-FAST forehead sensor could provide data for vital sign measurements when located at the distal forearm instead of its intended location at the forehead to provide improved comfortability and easy placement. In a prospective setting, we recruited 30 patients undergoing surgery requiring postoperative care. At the postoperative care unit, patients were monitored for two hours using a standard patient monitor and with a study device equipped with a Nellcor™ Forehead SpO2 sensor. The readings were electronically recorded and compared in post hoc analysis using Bland-Altman plots, Spearman's correlation, and root-mean-square error (RMSE). Bland-Altman plot showed that saturation (SpO2) differed by a mean of -0.2 % points (SD, 4.6), with a patient-weighted Spearman's correlation (r) of 0.142, and an RMSE of 4.2 points. For HR measurements, the mean difference was 0.6 bpm (SD, 2.5), r = 0.997, and RMSE = 1.8. For RR, the mean difference was -0.5 1/min (4.1), r = 0.586, and RMSE = 4.0. The SpO2 readings showed a low mean difference, but also a low correlation and high RMSE, indicating that the Nellcor™ saturation sensor cannot reliably assess oxygen saturation at the forearm when compared to finger PPG measurements.","Harju, Jarkko; Vehkaoja, Antti; Lindroos, Ville; Kumpulainen, Pekka; Liuhanen, Sasu; Yli-Hankala, Arvi; Oksala, Niku",Journal of clinical monitoring and computing,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10877-016-9940-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27752932/,101

In contrast to 2001, there is now a procedure for the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to develop, license, and stockpile MCMs for civilian use. Another major accomplishment is smallpox preparedness: There is now an adequate supply of vaccine for every person in the U.S., and there is an alternative vaccine meant for immunocompromised people and those with close contact with them. In spite of these and other accomplishments, the U.S. government MCM effort has been criticized by federal advisory committees, National Academy of Sciences reports, a congressional commission, and outside analysts who state that the efforts lack central leadership and accountability and that the pace of progress has been slow. A clear operational strategy for using MCMs, which would guide their development and acquisition, is also lacking.

It is usually observed in 20-30% of individuals meeting diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD). There is currently no agreement on whether melancholic MDD represents a distinct entity defined by neurobiological as well as clinical features or, rather, a specifier for MDD. This situation is reflected in the revisions to DSM, including in the DSM-5 due for release in 2013. With this context in mind, the authors review the origins of the construct of melancholia in MDD, its theoretical grounding and the defining characteristics that arose from this research. The authors then outline the state of knowledge on the neurobiology of melancholia. This second aspect is illustrative of the National Institutes of Mental Health's research domain criteria initiative, which offers a framework for redefining constructs along neurobiological dimensions.

Based on previous studies, an appropriate minimum target for moisture output is 30 and 20 g.m⁻³ for long-duration use in intensive care and short-duration use in anaesthesia, respectively. The practice of reusing a breathing system in anaesthesia, provided it is protected by a filter, assumes that the filter is effective.

Among various influenza vaccine types, the inactivated subunit type is known to provide improved safety with reduced reactogenicity. However, there are some drawbacks associated with inactivated subunit type vaccines, with the main ones being its low immunogenicity and the induction of Th2-biased immune responses. In this study, we investigated the role of a single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) derived from the intergenic region in the internal ribosome entry site of the Cricket paralysis virus as an adjuvant rather than the universal vaccine for a seasonal inactivated subunit influenza vaccine. The ssRNA adjuvant stimulated not only well-balanced cellular (indicated by IgG2a, IFN-γ, IL-2, and TNF-α) and humoral (indicated by IgG1 and IL-4) immune responses but also a mucosal immune response (indicated by IgA), a key protector against respiratory virus infections. It also increases the HI titer, the surrogate marker of influenza vaccine efficacy. Furthermore, ssRNA adjuvant confers cross-protective immune responses against heterologous influenza virus infection while promoting enhanced viral clearance. Moreover, ssRNA adjuvant increases the number of memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, which can be expected to induce long-term immune responses. Therefore, this ssRNA-adjuvanted seasonal inactivated subunit influenza vaccine might be the best influenza vaccine generating robust humoral and cellular immune responses and conferring cross-protective and long-term immunity.","Kim, Yun-Hee; Bang, Yoo-Jin; Park, Hyo-Jung; Li Ko, Hae; Park, Sang-In; Hwang, Kyung-Ah; Kim, Hun; Nam, Jae-Hwan",Vaccine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2020.07.022; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32739118/,101

Not only mutation of the CEBPA gene, but also promoter methylation, which results in silencing of CEBPA, contributes to the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We sought for another differentially methylated region (DMR) that associate with the CEBPA silencing and disease phenotype. METHODS Using databases, we identified a conserved DMR in the CEBPA 3'-untranslated region (UTR). RESULTS Methylation-specific PCR analysis of 231 AML cases showed that hypermethylation of the 3'-UTR was associated with AML that had a myeloid/NK/T-cell phenotype and down-regulated CEBPA. Most of these cases were of an immature phenotype with CD7/CD56 positivity. These cases were significantly associated with lower hemoglobin levels than the others. Furthermore, we discovered that the CEBPA 3'-UTR DMR can enhance transcription from the CEBPA native promoter. In vitro experiments identified IKZF1 binding sites in the 3'-UTR that are responsible for this increased transcription of CEBPA. CONCLUSIONS These results indicate that the CEBPA 3'-UTR DMR is a novel regulatory element of CEBPA related to myeloid/NK/T-cell lineage leukemogenesis. Transcriptional regulation of CEBPA by IKZF1 may provide a clue for understanding the fate determination of myeloid vs. NK/T-lymphoid progenitors.","Kimura, Yukiko; Iwanaga, Eisaku; Iwanaga, Kouta; Endo, Shinya; Inoue, Yoshitaka; Tokunaga, Kenji; Nagahata, Yousuke; Masuda, Kyoko; Kawamoto, Hiroshi; Matsuoka, Masao",European journal of haematology,https://doi.org/10.1111/ejh.13551; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33197296/,101

This may be because some acellular dermal matrices are actually not terminally sterilized but are instead ""aseptically processed."" This study evaluates aseptic and sterile matrices for evidence of bacterial contamination and whether or not terminal sterilization affects matrix collagen architecture and stem cell ingrowth. METHODS Five separate samples of 14 different matrices were analyzed by fluorescent in situ hybridization using a bacterial DNA probe to detect bacterial DNA on the matrices. Separate samples were incubated for bacteria, acid-fast bacilli, and fungi for 2 to 6 weeks to detect living organisms. The impact of terminal sterilization on the collagen network and stem cell ingrowth on the matrices was then assessed. RESULTS Traces of bacterial DNA were encountered on all matrices, with more bacteria in the aseptic group compared with the sterile group (3.4 versus 1.6; p = 0.003). The number of positive cultures was the same between groups (3.8 percent). Electron microscopy demonstrated decreased collagen organization in the sterile group. Stem cell seeding on the matrices displayed a wide variation of cellular ingrowth between matrices, with no difference between aseptic and sterile groups (p = 0.2). CONCLUSIONS Although there was more evidence of prior bacterial contamination on aseptically processed matrices compared with sterile matrices; clinical cultures did not differ between groups. Terminal sterilization does not appear to affect stem cell ingrowth but may come at the cost of damaging the collagen network.

The goal of this study was to systematically review the genomics, epigenetics, and cytogenetics of ONB and to understand the potential clinical implications of these studies. Methods A systematic literature review was performed for articles published before May 2020 using Cochrane, Embase, Pubmed, and Scopus databases. Inclusion criteria included genomics, cytogenetics, and epigenetics studies on ONB. Exclusion criteria included studies not in English or systematic reviews. Articles and abstracts were reviewed by two independent reviewers to reduce bias during article selection and synthesis of results. Of the 36 studies included in this review, 24 were research articles and 12 were abstracts. Results Although recurrent mutations among ONB tumors are uncommon, alterations in TP53, DMD, PIK3CA, NF1, CDKN2A, CDKN2C, CTNNB1, EGFR, APC, cKIT, cMET, PDGFRA, CDH1, FH, SMAD4, FGFR3 and IDH2 genes have been reported in several recent studies. In addition, cytogenetic studies revealed that the landscape of chromosomal aberrations varies widely amongst ONB tumors. Conclusions The rare character of ONB has limited the sample size available for cytogenetic, genomic, and epigenetic studies and contributes to the limitations of this systematic review. Comprehensive genomic and epigenomic studies with larger cohorts are warranted to validate the initial reports summarized in this review and to identify potential therapeutic targets for ONB.","Kaur, Raman Preet; Izumchenko, Evgeny; Blakaj, Dukagjin M; Mladkova, Nikol; Lechner, Matt; Beaumont, Thomas L; Floudas, Charalampos S; Gallia, Gary L; London, Nyall R",Laryngoscope investigative otolaryngology,https://doi.org/10.1002/lio2.597; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34401496/,101

Recognizing this, New York City Health + Hospitals established a clinician-staffed COVID-19 hotline for all New Yorkers. The hotline underwent three phases as the health crisis evolved. As of May 1, 2020, the hotline received over 90,000 calls and was staffed by over 1,000 unique clinicians. Hotline clinicians provided New Yorkers with clinical assessment and guidance, registered them for home symptom monitoring, connected them to social services, and provided a source of up-to-date answers to COVID-19 questions. By connecting New Yorkers with hotline providers, regardless of their regular avenues of accessing care, the hotline aimed to ease the pressures on the City's overtaxed emergency medical services. Future consideration should be given to promoting easy access to clinician hotlines by disadvantaged communities early in a public health crisis as well as evaluating the impact of clinician hotlines on clinical outcomes.

The process of demyelination is largely immune-mediated, as immunodeficient mice (RAG1(-/-) mice) do not develop demyelination upon infection; however, demyelination develops if these mice are reconstituted with either JHMV-immune CD4 or CD8 T cells. Because myelin destruction is a consequence of the inflammatory response associated with virus clearance, we reasoned that decreasing the amount of inflammation would diminish clinical disease and demyelination. Given that regulatory T cells (Tregs) have potent anti-inflammatory effects, we adoptively transferred Tregs into infected C57BL/6 and RAG1(-/-) mice. In both instances, transfer of Tregs decreased weight loss, clinical scores, and demyelination. Transferred Tregs were not detected in the CNS of infected RAG1(-/-) mice, but rather appeared to mediate their effects in the draining cervical lymph nodes. We show that Tregs dampen the inflammatory response mediated by transferred JHMV-immune splenocytes in infected RAG1(-/-) mice by decreasing T cell proliferation, dendritic cell activation, and proinflammatory cytokine/chemokine production, without inducing apoptosis. By extension, decreasing inflammation, whether by Treg transfer or by otherwise enhancing the anti-inflammatory milieu, could contribute to improved clinical outcomes in patients with virus-induced demyelination.","Trandem, Kathryn; Anghelina, Daniela; Zhao, Jingxian; Perlman, Stanley",Journal of immunology,https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.0903918; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20208000/,101

The activity of SOD and ascorbic acid levels were significantly higher in tissues of RJX-P or RJX-B treated rats than vehicle-treated control rats (p < 0.0001). There was no statistically significant difference between tissue SOD activity or ascorbic acid levels of rats treated with RJX-P vs. rats treated with RJX-B (p > 0.05). The observed elevations of the SOD and ascorbic acid levels were transient and were no longer detectable on day 28 following a 14-day recovery period. These results demonstrate that RJX-P and RJX-B are bioequivalent relative to their pharmacodynamic effects on tissue SOD and ascorbic acid levels. Furthermore, both formulations showed profound protective activity in a mouse model of sepsis. In agreement with the PD evaluations in rats and their proposed mechanism of action, both RJX-P and RJX-B exhibited near-identical potent and dose-dependent anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory activity in the LPS-GalN model of ARDS and multi-organ failure in mice.","Uckun, Fatih M; Orhan, Cemal; Powell, Joy; Sahin, Emre; Ozercan, Ibrahim H; Volk, Michael; Sahin, Kazim",Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopha.2021.111823; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34147902/,101

A 20-mm incision was created on the left side of the umbilicus and all three trocars (12, 5, and 5 mm) were inserted into the incision. The hernial defect was 14 × 9 cm and was repaired with intraperitoneal onlay mesh and a prosthetic graft. The postoperative course was uneventful.

151559,Incubation Period and Reproduction Number for Novel Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) Infections in India.,2020-08-30,"Intermolecular recombination between the genomes of closely related RNA viruses can result in the emergence of novel strains with altered pathogenic potential and antigenicity. Although recombination between flavivirus genomes has never been demonstrated experimentally, the potential risk of generating undesirable recombinants has nevertheless been a matter of concern and controversy with respect to the development of live flavivirus vaccines. As an experimental system for investigating the ability of flavivirus genomes to recombine, we developed a ""recombination trap,"" which was designed to allow the products of rare recombination events to be selected and amplified. To do this, we established reciprocal packaging systems consisting of pairs of self-replicating subgenomic RNAs (replicons) derived from tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), West Nile virus (WNV), and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) that could complement each other in trans and thus be propagated together in cell culture over multiple passages. Any infectious viruses with intact, full-length genomes that were generated by recombination of the two replicons would be selected and enriched by end point dilution passage, as was demonstrated in a spiking experiment in which a small amount of wild-type virus was mixed with the packaged replicons. Using the recombination trap and the JEV system, we detected two aberrant recombination events, both of which yielded unnatural genomes containing duplications. Infectious clones of both of these genomes yielded viruses with impaired growth properties. Despite the fact that the replicon pairs shared approximately 600 nucleotides of identical sequence where a precise homologous crossover event would have yielded a wild-type genome, this was not observed in any of these systems, and the TBEV and WNV systems did not yield any viable recombinant genomes at all. Our results show that intergenomic recombination can occur in the structural region of flaviviruses but that its frequency appears to be very low and that therefore it probably does not represent a major risk in the use of live, attenuated flavivirus vaccines.","Taucher, Christian; Berger, Angelika; Mandl, Christian W",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01063-09; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19864381/,101

BACKGROUND Nurses' self-concept is important to alleviate the current shortage of nurses. Nurses' self-concept questionnaire is an effective instrument to measure nurses' self-perception of professional competencies. However, the psychometric properties of the Chinese version have not been tested. METHODS A two-stage research design was used in this study. At Stage 1347 registered nurses were recruited to establish the psychometric properties of the Chinese version. At Stage 2, a confirmatory factor analysis was used to examine the extracted factor structure from Stage 1 with 1017 respondents as a sample. RESULTS The internal consistency of the Chinese version was 0.95 and the test-retest reliability was 0.83. The exploratory factor analysis extracted six dimensions. The findings at Stage 2 showed an acceptable model fit and discriminant validity. The Chinese version was a significant predictor of Maslach Burnout Inventory (β = -0.58; P = 0.00).

OBJECTIVE To compare differences in volume control (VC) ventilation with set-point and dual targeting. Two hypotheses were tested: tidal volume (V(T)) delivery is different with VC using set-point versus dual targeting during active versus passive breathing; VC with dual targeting delivers V(T) similar to pressure support ventilation (PS) with active breathing. METHODS The Ingmar Medical ASL 5000 lung model simulated pulmonary mechanics of an adult patient with ARDS during active and passive ventilation. Resistance was standardized at 10 cm H(2)O/L/s and compliance at 32 mL/cm H(2)O. Active breathing was simulated by setting the frequency (f) = 26 breaths/min, and adjusting the muscle pressure (P(mus)) to produce a V(T) of 384 mL. VC was initiated with the Puritan Bennett 840 (set-point targeting) and the Servo-i (dual targeting) at V(T) = 430 mL, mandatory f = 15 breaths/min, and PEEP = 10 cm H(2)O. During PS, cycle threshold was set to 30% and peak inspiratory pressure adjusted to produce a V(T) similar to that delivered during VC. Expiratory V(T) was collected on 10 consecutive breaths during active and passive breathing with VC and PS. Mean V(T) differences (active vs passive model) were compared using analysis of variance. Statistical significance was established at P < .05. RESULTS The mean ± SD V(T) difference varied with targeting schemes: VC set-point = 37.3 ± 3.5 mL, VC-dual = 77.1 ± 3.3 mL, and PS = 406.1 ± 1.5 mL (P < .001). Auto-triggering occurred during VC set-point with the active model. CONCLUSIONS Dual targeting during VC allows increased V(T), compared to set-point, but not as much as PS.","Volsko, Teresa A; Hoffman, Justin; Conger, Alecia; Chatburn, Robert L",Respiratory care,https://doi.org/10.4187/respcare.01529; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22348796/,101
153873,COVID-related family separation and trauma in the intensive care unit.,2020-06-22,"Almost all medical care in the United States is delivered with the provider and patient in immediate proximity; this model is referred to as face-to-face care. Medical services can be apportioned as procedural care (eg, surgery, radiology, or laboratory testing and others) or cognitive care, also known as Evaluation and Management (E/M) services, in which the provider formulates an assessment and plan after obtaining information from the patient's history, examination, and diagnostic tests.Providing a medical opinion and plan using the telephone as the technology that links the provider and the patient is an example of a non-face-to-face E/M service. Common Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes and the details for how to provide telephone services have been available for decades but have not been reimbursed and therefore were rarely used. In recent years, as new technologies have evolved, there has been slow and steady acceptance that non-face-to-face E/M care can be an adjunct to or replacement for some face-to-face E/M services. These technologies and the descriptors for associated CPT and Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) codes were introduced over the past few years and have become known by the generic term telehealth. They have been slowly incorporated into medical practice. Most of these services were introduced in the consumer retail market, in which the cost was borne directly by the patient, or as private contract services, in which the cost was borne by the consulting hospital, such as with telestroke services. In both the consumer retail model and private contract model, the care delivered usually did not involve CPT or HCPCS coding. The adoption of telehealth has been slow, in part because of the initial costs and several regulatory constraints, as well as the reluctance of patients, providers, and the insurance industry to change the concept that medical care could only be delivered when the patient and their provider were in physical proximity.After the COVID-19 pandemic reached the United States, the US Department of Health & Human Services issued a public health emergency and declared a Section 1135 Waiver that lifted many of the administrative constraints. With the need for near-absolute social distancing, this perfect storm has resulted in the immediate adoption of telemedicine, at least for the duration of the pandemic, for cognitive care to be delivered using communication technologies that are already in place. This article discusses the most common forms of non-face-to-face E/M care and the proper coding elements necessary to provide these services.","Cohen, Bruce H; Busis, Neil A; Ciccarelli, Luana",Continuum,https://doi.org/10.1212/con.0000000000000874; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32487907/,101

The virtual imaging trial is a unique framework that can greatly facilitate the assessment and optimization of imaging methods by emulating the imaging experiment using representative computational models of patients and validated imaging simulators. The purpose of this study was to show how virtual imaging trials can be adapted for imaging studies of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), enabling effective assessment and optimization of CT and radiography acquisitions and analysis tools for reliable imaging and management of COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS. We developed the first computational models of patients with COVID-19 and as a proof of principle showed how they can be combined with imaging simulators for COVID-19 imaging studies. For the body habitus of the models, we used the 4D extended cardiac-torso (XCAT) model that was developed at Duke University. The morphologic features of COVID-19 abnormalities were segmented from 20 CT images of patients who had been confirmed to have COVID-19 and incorporated into XCAT models. Within a given disease area, the texture and material of the lung parenchyma in the XCAT were modified to match the properties observed in the clinical images. To show the utility, three developed COVID-19 computational phantoms were virtually imaged using a scanner-specific CT and radiography simulator. RESULTS. Subjectively, the simulated abnormalities were realistic in terms of shape and texture. Results showed that the contrast-to-noise ratios in the abnormal regions were 1.6, 3.0, and 3.6 for 5-, 25-, and 50-mAs images, respectively. CONCLUSION. The developed toolsets in this study provide the foundation for use of virtual imaging trials in effective assessment and optimization of CT and radiography acquisitions and analysis tools to help manage the COVID-19 pandemic.","Abadi, Ehsan; Paul Segars, W; Chalian, Hamid; Samei, Ehsan",AJR.

154597,Mental Health Service Challenges during the Early Stage of the COVID-19 Pandemic: Experience and Best Practices from China.,2020-11-23,"BACKGROUND The transrectal natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) approach is a potentially promising alternative to transgastric or transvaginal approaches for intraperitoneal procedures. However, whether the optimal transrectal approach for intraperitoneal surgery is anterior or posterior remains unknown. To evaluate this, a prospective comparison of anterior and posterior transrectal NOTES approaches in a cadaveric appendectomy model was performed. METHODS Operations were performed on human cadavers using a transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM) scope to assist with access and closure. Posterior access was achieved by tunneling cephalad through the retrorectal space into the peritoneal cavity. Anterior transrectal access was established through the rectal wall just above the peritoneal reflection. A dual-channel flexible endoscope was used to perform appendectomies. Rectotomies were closed using sutures or staples. Operative time, degree of laparoscopic assistance, complications, and leak-testing results were recorded. RESULTS This study investigated 10 cadavers with access and closure attempted using both anterior (n = 10) and posterior (n = 5) approaches, whereas appendectomies were performed using either an anterior (n = 8) or a posterior (n = 2) approach. The anterior approach required less time than the posterior approach for peritoneal access (4 ± 1 vs. 61 ± 14 min; p < 0.001), specimen extraction (2 ± 1 vs. 5 ± 1 min; p < 0.01), and the total operation (99 ± 35 vs. 176 ± 26 min; p = 0.02). A ""pure"" NOTES dissection was possible with the anterior approach using rigid transanal instruments for assistance. Dissection time, closure time, and the incidence of complications were similar between the two approaches. Leak testing of closures showed significant variability for all closure types. CONCLUSION Transrectal NOTES appendectomy is feasible in a cadaveric model using an anterior transrectal approach. This approach is technically easier, results in shorter operative times, and allows for a ""pure"" NOTES dissection compared with a posterior transrectal approach. Leak pressure testing of NOTES closures is unreliable in the cadaveric model.","Santos, Byron F; Hungness, Eric S; Boller, Anne-Marie",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-011-1787-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21643877/,101

In most countries in the world, the outbreak of the disease has been serious and the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases has increased daily, while, fortunately the recovered COVID-19 cases have also increased. Clearly, forecasting the ""confirmed"" and ""recovered"" COVID-19 cases helps planning to control the disease and plan for utilization of health care resources. Time series models based on statistical methodology are useful to model time-indexed data and for forecasting. Autoregressive time series models based on two-piece scale mixture normal distributions, called TP-SMN-AR models, is a flexible family of models involving many classical symmetric/asymmetric and light/heavy tailed autoregressive models. In this paper, we use this family of models to analyze the real world time series data of confirmed and recovered COVID-19 cases.","Maleki, Mohsen; Mahmoudi, Mohammad Reza; Wraith, Darren; Pho, Kim-Hung",Travel medicine and infectious disease,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tmaid.2020.101742; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33081974/,101

All patients transported by EMS in the city of Okayama from March-May 2019 or March-May 2020 were included. Interfacility transports were excluded. The primary outcome was the time from a patient's first emergency call until hospital arrival (total prehospital time). Secondary outcomes included three segments of total prehospital time: the response time, on-scene time, and transportation time. Total prehospital time and the durations of each segment were compared between corresponding months in 2020 (COVID19-affected) and 2019 (control). The results showed that total prehospital times in April 2020 were significantly higher than those in 2019 (33.8 ± 11.6 vs. 32.2 ± 10.8 min, p < 0.001).

DESIGN Food and Drug Administration-approved, prospective, multicenter, nonrandomized, parallel-group, assessor-masked, confirmatory trial. PARTICIPANTS Patients enrolled were 22 years of age or older with a diagnosis of bilateral cataract with planned removal by phacoemulsification with a clear corneal incision. METHODS Consented participants selected their preferred IOL, which was implanted sequentially into each eye of patients meeting eligibility criteria. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The coprimary effectiveness outcomes were mean photopic monocular best-corrected distance visual acuity (BCDVA; 4 m) and distance-corrected near visual acuity (DCNVA; 40 cm) at 6 months after surgery. Secondary effectiveness outcomes included mean monocular distance-corrected intermediate visual acuity (DCIVA; 66 cm) and proportion of participants responding ""never"" to question 1 of the Intraocular Lens Satisfaction questionnaire (regarding frequency of spectacle use in the past 7 days). Safety outcomes included frequency of ""severe"" and ""most bothersome"" visual disturbances. RESULTS Two hundred forty-three patients underwent cataract surgery with bilateral implantation of the TFNT00 (n = 129) or SN60AT (n = 114) and were followed up for 6 months. Noninferiority of TFNT00 to SN60AT in mean photopic monocular BCDVA (95% upper confidence limit of the difference was <0.1 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution [logMAR] margin), and superiority in mean photopic monocular DCNVA (difference of 0.42 logMAR; P < 0.001) and DCIVA (difference of 0.26 logMAR; P < 0.001) were demonstrated. The proportion of patients never requiring glasses overall was superior for TFNT00 versus SN60AT (80.5% and 8.2%, respectively). Starbursts, halos, and glare were the most frequently rated severe symptoms with TFNT00; however, less than 5% of patients were very bothered at month 6. CONCLUSIONS The TFNT00 exhibited superior monocular DCNVA and DCIVA to a spherical monofocal IOL, with comparable monocular BCDVA. Binocular visual acuity was 20/25 or better for distance to near (+0.5 D to -2.5 D), resulting in high levels of spectacle independence. Less than 5% of patients were very bothered by the photic visual disturbances associated with the TFNT00 at 6 months after surgery.","Modi, Satish; Lehmann, Robert; Maxwell, Andrew; Solomon, Kerry; Cionni, Robert; Thompson, Vance; Horn, Jeffrey; Caplan, Michael; Fisher, Bret; Hu, Jerry G; Yeu, Elizabeth",Ophthalmology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ophtha.2020.07.015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33004211/,101

A handful of prophylactic VLP-based vaccines is currently commercialized worldwide: GlaxoSmithKline's Engerix (hepatitis B virus) and Cervarix (human papillomavirus), and Merck and Co., Inc.'s Recombivax HB (hepatitis B virus) and Gardasil (human papillomavirus) are some examples. Other VLP-based vaccine candidates are in clinical trials or undergoing preclinical evaluation, such as, influenza virus, parvovirus, Norwalk and various chimeric VLPs. Many others are still restricted to small-scale fundamental research, despite their success in preclinical tests. This article focuses on the essential role of VLP technology in new-generation vaccines against prevalent and emergent diseases. The implications of large-scale VLP production are discussed in the context of process control, monitorization and optimization. The main up- and down-stream technical challenges are identified and discussed accordingly. Successful VLP-based vaccine blockbusters are briefly presented concomitantly with the latest results from clinical trials and the recent developments in chimeric VLP-based technology for either therapeutic or prophylactic vaccination.","Roldão, António; Mellado, Maria Candida M; Castilho, Leda R; Carrondo, Manuel J T; Alves, Paula M",Expert review of vaccines,https://doi.org/10.1586/erv.10.115; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20923267/,101

We aim to investigate US medical students' perspectives on the potential implications this transition would have on their education and career opportunities. METHODS A cross-sectional study investigating US medical students' perspectives on the implications of transition of the USMLE Step 1 exam to pass/fail. Students were asked their preferences regarding various aspects of the USMLE Step 1 examination, including activities, educational opportunities, expenses regarding preparation for the examination, and future career opportunities. RESULTS 215 medical students responded to the survey, 59.1% were women, 80.9% were allopathic vs. 19.1% osteopathic students. 34.0% preferred the USMLE Step 1 to be graded on a pass/fail score, whereas 53.5% preferred a numeric scale. Osteopathic vs. allopathic students were more likely to report that the pass/fail transition will negatively impact their residency match (aOR = 1.454, 95% CI: 0.515, 4.106) and specialty of choice (aOR = 3.187, 95% CI: 0.980, 10.359). 57.7% of respondents reported that the transition to a pass/fail grading system will change their study habits. CONCLUSIONS The transition of the USMLE Step 1 to a pass/fail system has massive implications on medical students and residency programs alike. Though the majority of medical students did not prefer the USMLE Step 1 to have a pass/fail score, they must adapt their strategies to remain competitive for residency applications. Residency programs should create a composite score based off all aspects of medical students' applications in order to create a holistic and fair evaluation and ranking system.","Ehrlich, Haley; Sutherland, Mason; McKenney, Mark; Elkbuli, Adel",The American surgeon,https://doi.org/10.1177/0003134820973382; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33345588/,101
159811,Exploring the Impact of COVID-19 on the Sustainability of Health Critical Care Systems in South America.,2020-07-05,"INTRODUCTION Currently, neoplasms of the trachea and lower airway demand open transcervical approach with or without thoracotomy. We describe here a novel, minimally invasive approach for an intraluminal lesion of the thoracic trachea, called percutaneous trans-tracheal endoscopic approach (PTEA). Apart from obvious advantages over potentially morbid open procedures, this technique has certain peculiar benefits over rigid or flexible bronchoscopic approach. MATERIALS AND METHODS A 43-year-old male patient had glomus tumor of thoracic trachea. After detailed workup and informed written consent, he was taken up for percutaneous trans-tracheal excision under general anesthesia. The foremost step of the procedure is awake fiberoptic guided intubation, using the microlaryngeal tracheal tube, followed by elective tracheotomy. Subsequently, the lower end of the microlaryngeal tube was carefully pushed further inside the trachea so that the cuff of the tube lies distal to the tumor. The cuff is then inflated so that the operating area is sealed off from lower airway to aid continuous inhalational anesthesia and to prevent aspiration of blood. The surgeon sitting at the head end removed the tumor through tracheotomy under endoscopic guidance. After achieving absolute hemostasis, neck wound was closed. RESULTS Patient had complete removal of the tumor without any aspiration intraoperatively or in the postoperative period. The anesthetic agent could be delivered uninterrupted through the secured airway, below the operative area separated by sealed cuff of the microlaryngeal tube. CONCLUSIONS For excision of benign luminal lesions of the lower trachea, the novel approach of PTEA has many distinct and fool proof advantages in comparison to the transoral laryngoscopic/bronchoscopic and the transcervical approaches.","Sharma, Suresh C; Devaraja, K; Kairo, Arvind; Kumar, Rakesh",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

AIM Youth at CHR for psychosis often demonstrate significant negative symptoms and poor functioning, though the magnitude and direction of the relationship between the two remains unknown. The objective of this systematic review is to summarize the relationship between negative symptoms and functioning in CHR samples. METHOD Electronic databases CINAHL, EBM, Embase, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO were searched from inception. Studies were selected if they included any study that reported a relationship between negative symptoms and functioning in youth at clinical high risk (CHR). The correlation coefficient r was converted to Cohen's d, and all random-effects meta-analyses were performed using the transformed values. RESULTS Forty-one studies met the inclusion criteria, including a total of 4574 individuals at CHR for psychosis. Negative symptom total scores were significantly associated with poorer global functioning (d, -1.40; 95% CI, -1.82 to -0.98; I = 79.4%; p < .001 [9 studies, n = 782]), social functioning (d, -1.10; 95% CI, -1.27 to -0.93; I = 10.40%; p < .001 [12 studies, n = 811]), and role functioning (d, -0.96; 95% CI, -1.17 to -0.76; I = 41.1%; p < .001 [9 studies, n = 881]). In addition, negative symptoms were consistently associated with poor premorbid functioning. When examining negative symptom domains, avolition, anhedonia, and blunted affect were each significantly and independently associated with poorer social functioning and role functioning. In terms of prediction models, negative symptoms contributed to the prediction of lower functioning across multiple studies. CONCLUSION This meta-analysis demonstrates a strong relationship between negative symptoms and functioning in youth at clinical high risk for psychosis.","Devoe, Daniel J; Braun, Amy; Seredynski, Thomas; Addington, Jean",Harvard review of psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1097/hrp.0000000000000273; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33156155/,101

In this work, we propose an agent-based model of the epidemic in a confined space of agents representing humans. An extension to the SEIR model allows us to consider the difference between the appearance (black-box view) of the spread of disease and the real situation (glass-box view). Our model allows for simulations of lockdowns, social distancing, personal hygiene, quarantine, and hospitalization, with further considerations of different parameters, such as the extent to which hygiene and social distancing are observed in a population. Our results provide qualitative indications of the effects of various policies and parameters, for instance, that lockdowns by themselves are extremely unlikely to bring an end to an epidemic and may indeed make things worse, that social distancing is more important than personal hygiene, and that the growth of infection is significantly reduced for moderately high levels of social distancing and hygiene, even in the absence of herd immunity.","Trivedi, Ashutosh Sreenivas Nanda Kishore Rao Shrisha",Systems,https://doi.org/10.3390/systems9030053,101
164888,Introduction to the Thematic Section on Health Economics,2021,"The outbreak of novel coronavirus disease(COVID-19) has spread worldwide as a severe respiratory disease. The public's health as well as the global financial system are also in serious jeopardy. Computer-aided fast and automated diagnosis toolkits are required to reduce the prevalence of this deadly virus. However, one of the main challenges is to differentiate between COVID-19 and typical pneumonia cases, as most clinical manifestations are very similar. So, it is vital to detect the region of infections caused by COVID-19 rather than the mere disease prediction. In this study, a residual guided deep learning-based segmentation framework named 'RGU-Net' was proposed to quantify COVID-19 cases accurately using chest CT slices. However, deeper networks often suffer from vanishing-gradient problems. A stack of residual guided skip-connections was utilized with the 'U-Net' architecture to develop the proposed 'RGU-Net'. The 'RGU-Net' was intended to retain the spatial and location information as well as alleviate the vanishing-gradient issue. A modified segmentation loss called 'Dice Focal' loss was also introduced in this study to reduce the impact of noisy ground truth labels and class imbalance issue. The segmentation results demonstrate the outstanding performance of the proposed framework compared to the recent competing segmentation models.

Respondents were recruited by distributing the link to the survey via personal communication, email and various social media channels to nursing staff from hospitals, nursing homes and outpatient care. Results There were in total 428 participants (18.2% male, 82.5% female), mostly (30.5%) aged between 45 and 55 years. Half of respondents (48.3%) had more than 20 years of experience in nursing. Cardiac, pulmonary, or other pre-existing conditions were reported by 46.2%. Nurses and nursing assistants working in personal protective equipment during hot days were exposed to occupational heat stress. Work was found exhaustive by 96.5% of the participants during those days. 93.0% reported breathing problems and 85.8% reported difficulties with focusing on their work. Many workplaces did not provide adequate heat protection, with distinct differences concerning the amount of prophylactic and heat mitigating measures across institutions. There were significant differences across institutions when it comes to the number of drinks served (p&lt;0.001), the availability of room thermometers (p&lt;0.001), the use of mobile cooling devices (p&lt;0.001) and fans (p&lt;0.05).

A difficult process has been experienced for businesses caught unprepared for this situation. The purpose of the study, the difficulties experienced in the business have been mapped in terms of crisis management. Design/methodology/approach: For this purpose, crisis management strategies have been discussed in terms of lean six sigma (LSS) strategies. Afterward, LSS strategies have been weighted with the spherical fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (AHP) method, which has been recently introduced to the literature (Gündogdu and Kahraman, 2020). While weighting has been done with the spherical fuzzy AHP method, three experts in the field of LSS at the master blackbelt level have been studied. Findings: The Covid-19 process has caused the usual processes of businesses to change. Businesses do not have enough time to adapt their business processes in the Covid-19 process. To eliminate waste and time in the Covid-19 process, the lean methodology was used. At the same time, quality deficiencies have been tried to be eliminated with the six sigma methodology. Therefore, the six sigma methodology and lean techniques should be considered together. With LSS, the adaptation of this process has been wanted to be accelerated. In this context, the criteria in the Covid-19 process were prioritized and losses were reduced in accordance with the LSS methodology. In this study, the most important criterion during the covid-19 pandemic has been determined as “responding to the changing needs of customers” and the least important criterion has been determined as “communication with stakeholders in enterprises.” Research limitations/implications: This study has been applied the Covid-19 pandemics. So, it has been evaluated related to these specific criteria. Practical implications: Covid-19 crisis management was examined for the first time within the scope of the LSS methodology. The criteria in the Covid-19 process were determined by six sigma expert master black belts. For the first time, spherical fuzzy AHP, one of the multi-criteria decision methods, has been applied to the Covid-19 process. Originality/value: This study has been aimed to create a roadmap to apply LSS steps in businesses against a possible second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. In this context, it is thought that the study will fill the following gaps in the literature: Covid-19 crisis management was examined for the first time within the scope of LSS methodology.

Results: Sleep disturbance was prevalent among adolescents (89% above average, T-score >50);about two-thirds (64.4%) reported greater stress due to the pandemic. Compared to White (88.5%) adolescents, sleep disturbance was more common in Black (91.2%), Hispanic (90.5%), American Indian/Alaska native (95.1%), and Mixed (92.3%) and less common in Asian (83.9%) adolescents. Chi-square analysis indicated that both race/ethnicity (-2 = 14.96, p<.05) and SVI (-2 = 8.34, p<.05) had an effect on sleep disturbance. HBLR analysis indicated that compared to pre-pandemic, adolescents reporting “little stress” (OR=.70, 95% CI= .49-.99, p=.04) or “the ”same amount of stress' (OR=.64, 95% CI= .47-.89, p=.007) had lower odds of sleep disturbance. Higher depression (OR=1.06, 95% CI=1.04-1.07, p<.001) and anxiety (OR=1.05, 95% CI=1.04-1.07, p<.001) symptoms increased odds of sleep disturbance, while male gender lowered odds of sleep disturbance (OR=.11, 95% CI=.015-.86, p<.05). Overall, race/ethnicity (p=.44) and SVI (p=.45) did not independently predict sleep disturbance. Race/ethnicity stratified analyses indicated that for Black and Hispanic adolescents, being in grades 11/ 12 and depression predicted sleep disturbance;and for Asian adolescents SVI and anxiety predicted sleep disturbance. Conclusion: COVID-related stress and symptoms of depression and anxiety are associated with sleep disturbance. We observed differences in sleep disturbance across racial/ethnic groups and neighborhood social vulnerability strata, for specific racial/ethnic groups.","Seixas, A.; Honaker, S.; Wolfson, A.; Wahlstrom, K.; Owens, J.; Wong, P.; Saletin, J.; Tsvetovat, M.; Carskadon, M.; Meltzer, L.",Sleep,https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/zsab072.231,101

The source of capital can be internal (buyer or supplier) or external (financial institution) to the supply chain. So far, many studies have investigated the optimal mix of the sources of capital;our study aims at contributing to the recent literature that explores the interface of operations and finance extending the supplier-based financing models. As the Covid-19 pandemic hits economic activity, the financial constraints have ever greater importance;knock-on effects of the Covid-19 crisis urges on the critical role of a supply chain that should provide financial resources, along to the flow of goods, in the more efficient way. The proposed model considers a supply chain formed by a supplier and a retailer, both capital-constrained that can ask for a loan to a financial institution or resort on their internal reciprocal sources. Demand is uncertain, retailer, that acts as a price taker, may also affect her product demand applying some effort in increasing sales. Both retailer and supplier can fail. The model optimizes the supplier and retailer’s’ profit varying their contract parameters;doing this, the research allows to understand the interplay between supply chain operational and financial issues when retailer’s sales effort is at work, and its findings can support retailer in the suppliers selection basing on their credit rating. Our findings show how operational (retailer’s effort) and financial (trade credit conditions) issues can synergically interact also in supply chain with low working capital or conversely how retailer with high working capital can perform better working with low rating supplier, however boosting the chance to successfully compete in the Covid-19 pandemic era.","Lo Nigro, Giovanna Favara Giovanni Abbate Lorenzo",International Journal of Production Economics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpe.2021.108235,101

173747,Nature engagement for human and nature’s well-being during the Corona pandemic,2021,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) has played a substantial role in the response to the challenges posed by the current pandemic. The growing interest in using AI to handle Covid-19 issues has accelerated the pace of AI research and resulted in an exponential increase in articles and review studies within a very short period of time. Hence, it is becoming challenging to explore the large corpus of academic publications dedicated to the global health crisis. Even with the presence of systematic review studies, given their number and diversity, identifying trends and research avenues beyond the pandemic should be an arduous task. We conclude therefore that after the one-year mark of the declaration of Covid-19 as a pandemic, the accumulated scientific contribution lacks two fundamental aspects: Knowledge synthesis and Future projections. In contribution to fill this void, this paper is a (i) synthesis study and (ii) foresight exercise. The synthesis study aims to provide the scholars a consolidation of findings and a knowledge synthesis through a systematic review of the reviews (umbrella review) studying AI applications against Covid-19. Following the PRISMA guidelines, we systematically searched PubMed, Scopus, and other preprint sources from 1st December 2019 to 1st June 2021 for eligible reviews. The literature search and screening process resulted in 45 included reviews. Our findings reveal patterns, relationships, and trends in the AI research community response to the pandemic. We found that in the space of few months, the research objectives of the literature have developed rapidly from identifying potential AI applications to evaluating current uses of intelligent systems. Only few reviews have adopted the meta-analysis as a study design. Moreover, a clear dominance of the medical theme and the DNN methods has been observed in the reported AI applications. Based on its constructive systematic umbrella review, this work conducts a foresight exercise that tries to envision the post-Covid-19 research landscape of the AI field. We see seven key themes of research that may be an outcome of the present crisis and which advocate a more sustainable and responsible form of intelligent systems. We set accordingly a post-pandemic research agenda articulated around these seven drivers. The results of this study can be useful for the AI research community to obtain a holistic view of the current literature and to help prioritize research needs as we are heading toward the new normal.","Adadi, Amina Lahmer Mohammed Nasiri Samia",Journal of King Saud University - Computer and Information Sciences,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jksuci.2021.07.010,101

175545,Perspectives on public health interventions in the management of the COVID-19 pandemic in Thailand,2020,"Dubbed as road warriors in the popular press, there is a select group of business traveling dealmakers that take at least four trips by commercial airline and stay in hotels at least thirty-five nights in a given year. These high value employees have often been subjected to cost-focused travel policies potentially to the detriment of their well-being. From a theoretical viewpoint, the boundaries of the existing sales literature are expanded to show how this unique group of salespeople, road warriors, face stressors and how these relate to major sales focused outcomes (job satisfaction, organizational commitment, and turnover intentions). Further, this study adds an additional construct, travel friction, into the literature, yielding support for the importance of developing an understanding of this construct. Travel friction is found as a significant antecedent to both work-family conflict and emotional exhaustion. Moreover, through emotional exhaustion both travel friction and work-family conflict ultimately manifest in reduced job satisfaction, diminished organizational commitment, and increased attrition risk. The lack of business travel in the short-term due to the global pandemic offers corporate travel managers a unique opportunity to pause and recalibrate their travel policies to focus more on traveler well-being. Practical suggestions from travel experts that can potentially help to mitigate travel friction among road warriors are offered.","Ambrose, Scott C.; Waguespack, Blaise P.; Rutherford, Brian N.",Journal of Air Transport Management,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jairtraman.2021.102087,101
176353,"Right to health, judicial review and constitutional state of emergency: a critical perspective of the pandemic",2021,"The importance of disulfide bond in mediating viral peptide entry into host cells is well known. In the present work, we elucidate the role of disulfide (SS) bond in partitioning mechanism of membrane active Hepatitis A Virus-2B (HAV-2B) peptide, which harbours three cysteine residues promoting formation of multiple SS-bonded states. The inclusion of SS-bond not only results in a compact conformation but also induces distorted α-helical hairpin geometry in comparison to SS-free state, resulting in reduced hydrophobic exposure. Owing to this, the partitioning of HAV-2B peptide is completely or partly abolished. In a way, the disulfide bond regulates the partitioning of HAV-2B peptide, such that the membrane remodelling effects of this viral peptide are significantly reduced. The current findings may have potential implications in drug designing, targeting the HAV-2B protein by promoting disulfide bond formation within its membrane active region.","Sikdar, Samapan; Banerjee, Manidipa; Vemparala, Satyavani",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.21.461184,101

This reinforces the importance of ensuring security and privacy for data-in-transit. One such solution is steganography-based schemes that utilize biological signals (e.g., ECG) as cover signals to preserve the privacy of patient personal information without affecting the diagnostic features. There are various limitations in existing steganography-based schemes, and in this study we present an effective privacy protection scheme leveraging both multidimensional steganography and shared keys. To enhance security and accelerate signal processing in our design, the Fast Walsh-Hadamard transform (FWHT) is employed to decompose ECG signals into a set of coefficients, of which the less-significant coefficients are used to construct the multidimensional space. The negotiated shared keys facilitate the embedding of encrypted data in the constructed space. We then evaluate the proposed scheme using different categories of ECG signals in the MIT-BIH database. It is observed that the signal distortion is minimal (i.e., less than 1%), even if the embedded data reaches the maximum embedding capacity. The security analysis also demonstrates that unauthorized retrieval of hidden information is not practical, within a short period of time.","Zhang, Liping Wei Zhen Ren Wei Zheng Xianghan Kim-Kwang Raymond Choo Xiong Neal N.",IEEE Transactions on Network Science and Engineering,https://doi.org/10.1109/tnse.2021.3063174,101

The purpose of this research was to assess job satisfaction in telework conditions, based on areas considered decisive and evaluated by specific items. To this end, an opinion questionnaire was created, the information was processed with correlation analysis and regression analysis. This study showed that job satisfaction in telework is associated with higher skills, autonomy, and a favorable organizational climate, but also with a higher level of emotional exhaustion generated by constant access to work, as well as the lack of relationships and mentoring. We found a statistically significant positive link between competencies, autonomy, organizational climate, and job satisfaction.

183148,Health in the Digital Age: Where Do Children’s Rights Fit In?,2020-12-11,"Hematological measures are important intermediate clinical phenotypes for many acute and chronic diseases. Hematological measures are highly heritable, and although genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified thousands of loci containing trait-associated variants, the causal genes underlying these associations are often uncertain. To better understand the underlying genetic regulatory mechanisms, we performed a transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) using PrediXcan to systematically investigate the association between genetically-predicted gene expression and hematological measures in 54,542 individuals of European ancestry from the Genetic Epidemiology Research on Adult Health and Aging (GERA) cohort. We found 239 significant gene-trait associations with hematological measures. Among this set of 239 associations, we replicated 71 at p < 0.05 with same direction of effect for the blood cell trait in a meta-analysis of TWAS results consisting of up to 35,900 European ancestry individuals from the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI), the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study (ARIC), and BioMe Biobank. We further attempted to refine this list of candidate genes by performing conditional analyses, adjusting for individual variants previously associated with these hematological measures, and performed further fine-mapping of TWAS loci. To assist with the interpretation of TWAS findings, we designed an R Shiny application to interactively visualize TWAS results, one genomic locus at a time, by integrating our TWAS results with additional genetic data sources (GWAS, TWAS from other gene expression reference panels, conditional analyses, known GWAS variants, etc.). Our results and R Shiny application highlight frequently overlooked challenges with TWAS and illustrate the complexity of TWAS fine-mapping efforts. Author Summary Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have shown great promise in furthering our understanding of the genetic regulatory mechanisms underlying complex trait variation. However, interpreting TWAS results can be incredibly complex, especially in large-scale analyses where hundreds of signals appear throughout the genome, with multiple genes often identified in a single chromosomal region. Our research demonstrates this complexity through real data examples from our analysis of hematological traits, and we provide a useful web application to visualize TWAS results in a broadly approachable format. Together, our results and web application illustrate the importance of interpreting TWAS studies in context and highlight the need to carefully examine results in a region-wide context to draw reasonable conclusions and formulate mechanistic hypotheses.","Tapia, Amanda L; Rowland, Bryce T; Rosen, Jonathan D; Preuss, Michael; Young, Kris; Graff, Misa; Choquet, Hélène; Couper, David J; Buyske, Steve; Bien, Stephanie A; Jorgenson, Eric; Kooperberg, Charles; Loos, Ruth J.F.; Morrison, Alanna C; North, Kari E; Yu, Bing; Reiner, Alexander P; Li, Yun; Raffield, Laura M",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.23.432444,101

Objectives: Intubation and extubation are aerosol-generating procedures and to safeguard from getting the infection in a pandemic situation like SARS-COVID19, the aerosol boxes are popular among health care workers. This questionnaire survey was carried out on the anesthesiologist resident doctors working in various medical colleges across India to identify the views of front-line professionals’ on the worth of the aerosol boxes during various procedures. Methods: This survey was conducted on 153 respondents with asking 25 questions regarding various usage of aerosol boxes related to intubation, extubation and sterilization. Gender and experience of more than 10 intubations were sought to find out whether it has any influence on the overall decision making. Statistical analysis was done with SPSS, chi-square tests used for categorical variables. Results: Out of 153 participants 64.5% of respondents were female and 35.5% were males. 49.3% had more than 10 intubation experience with the boxes. Mask ventilation was difficult for 91% and intubation was difficult for 98% of respondents. 90% of respondents were against the use of the box for difficult intubations. More experienced one was in favour of selectively removing the mask while intubation (P<0.001). Use of boxes for extubation and in ICU was better among experienced with P<0.001 and P=0.010 respectively. Patient contamination (54%) and inadequate sterilization (55%) of boxes believed by many as problems related to its use. Conclusions: Aerosol boxes are used by good numbers for mask ventilation and easy intubation, the experienced ones were more comfortable in using them for extubation and ICU procedures, however, sterilization and contamination is an issue to deal with. © IJCRR.","Kar, A.

The ""mobility turn"" in social sciences in the last decade recognizes that life is increasingly organized and shaped by mobilities (and immobilities) across varying spatial and temporal scales. Yet these mobilities have only recently been examined and theorized as central to understanding the complexity and diversity of young people's experiences. The collection of articles in this special issue presents a multiplicity of young people's relationships to mobilities, particularly as they pursue post-secondary education and employment. The papers are concerned with: (a) the motivations for and expectations of imagined mobility (the innumerable reasons why youth choose, or are compelled, to move or stay), whether focused on the outmigration or inmigration of mobile youth;(b) the lived experiences that youth have in their mobility practices (focusing on multistranded relationships between places of origin and destination, or recognizing the temporality of that mobility);and (c) the value that these youth mobility studies have for policy issues and policy recommendations. The papers in this issue are case studies concerned with youth mobility prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. They use qualitative and quantitative methods, representing inter- and cross-disciplinary approaches from anthropology, sociology, education, communication, and rural development studies. They derive from a collaboration through the On the Move Partnership, an 8-year interdisciplinary research initiative with a key focus on young people's employment- and education-related geographical mobilities in Canada.","Smith, A.; Power, N.",International Journal of Child Youth &amp; Family Studies,https://doi.org/10.18357/ijcyfs122202120230,101

We also aimed to raise awareness about the possible problems may have been encountered by the HCPs during the pandemic. Methodology: This qualitative study was conducted through semi-structured interviews with open-ended questions. A phenomenological approach used to collect data. Purposive and snowball sampling methods were used to recruit participants. We interviewed twelve HCP s. Topics included their first experience with a COVID-19 case, changes in the work environment, working with personal protective equipment (PPE), changes in private life, and the challenges encountered. Data gathering and data analysis were carried out concurrently. We used the classical content analysis method for data analysis. Results: Four main categories emerged from the content analysis. The first was “Responsibility”. Healthcare professionals felt responsible towards both the patients and healthy people and some experiences made them feel helpless. They expressed a wide range of feelings about their professions. The second category was “Fatigue”. Participants explained that they experienced intense fear initially and were very overwhelmed. All participants thought that people were insensitive to follow measurements. The third category was “Relief”. Before the outbreak reached Turkey, medical staff could not predict what was coming. Over time they got used to this new situation, and normalize their lives. The fourth category was “Experience”. Participants told about what they learned during the pandemic and made some suggestions. Conclusion: Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, some experiences can be demotivating and disappointing for healthcare professionals. Managers and supervisors should listen to their requests, and hearing positive feedback from authorities may increase their motivation.

They were taken during the course of other studies, mainly concerned with the mode of transmission of leprosy, and which included biopsies of skin, dartos muscle, nasal mucous membrane and nipple, results of which have already been published. Examination of serial sections by light microscopy revealed a density of cellular infiltration in non-lepromatous cases, or of bacilli in macrophages and Schwann cells in lepromatous cases, which was marked in degree and usually widespread from one end of the biopsy to the other. Intraneural caseation was recorded in four patients with tuberculoid or borderline-tuberculoid leprosy, and many others in this part of the spectrum showed extensive disruption of perineurial and endoneurial structure. In lepromatous patients, the numbers of bacilli in the endoneurial area not infrequently exceeded one thousand per oil immersion field.

For instance, in the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), ACE, AngII, and AT1R promote the disease pathogenesis, whereas ACE2 and the AT2R protect from ARDS. Importantly, ACE2 has been identified as a key SARS-coronavirus receptor and plays a protective role in SARS pathogenesis. Furthermore, the recent explosion of research into the ACE2 homolog, collectrin, has revealed a new physiological function of ACE2 as an amino acid transporter, which explains the pathogenic role of gene mutations in Hartnup disorder. This review summarizes and discusses the recently unveiled roles for ACE2 in disease pathogenesis.","Imai, Yumiko; Kuba, Keiji; Ohto-Nakanishi, Takayo; Penninger, Josef M",Circulation journal : official journal of the Japanese Circulation Society,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20134095/,101

188950,The Ministry of Health.,1920,"BACKGROUND Resource planning is essential for successful transport of the mechanically ventilated patient. Mechanically ventilated patients require adequate oxygen supplies to ensure transport is completed without incident. The LTV-1000 portable ventilator utilizes a program to calculate oxygen cylinder duration, based on cylinder size, fraction of inspired oxygen (F(IO(2))), and current minute ventilation. We evaluated the accuracy of the cylinder-duration algorithm in a laboratory setting. METHODS The LTV-1000 was attached to a test lung. Lung compliance was set at 0.04 L/cm H(2)O, and airway resistance was 5.0 cm H(2)O/L/s. We tested 7 different combinations of ventilator settings a minimum of 2 times each. With each setting, minute ventilation was kept at 10 L/min. Breath type, positive end-expiratory pressure, and F(IO(2)) were varied to evaluate the accuracy of the algorithm across a range of clinical scenarios. The cylinder-duration calculation from the ventilator program and manual calculation was determined at each setting and compared to the actual cylinder duration. RESULTS The ventilator algorithm and the manual calculation underestimated the actual cylinder duration by 12 +/- 3% with each test. The range of differences between calculated and actual cylinder duration was 2-26 min across the 7 conditions. CONCLUSION Actual cylinder duration averaged 12% longer than the cylinder duration estimated by the algorithm of the LTV-1000. One explanation is that the E cylinders may contain more liters of oxygen than indicated by the sticker on the side of the tank. Additionally, the bias flow during expiration is affected by inspiratory-expiratory ratio and respiratory rate. Clinicians should be aware of these differences when planning for patient transport.","Blakeman, Thomas C; Rodriquez, Dario; Branson, Richard D",Respiratory care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19712494/,101

These may vary from fatigue and myalgia to persistent, and even worsening breathlessness, due to pulmonary fibrosis. Management of post-COVID-19 pulmonary fibrosis is currently limited to symptomatic management and largely an unexplored aspect. OBJECTIVES To draw attention to the imminent threat of post-COVID-19 interstitial lung disease (PC-ILD) in COVID survivors through a case series. METHODS A retrospective analysis of data was done in patients admitted with severe COVID in December 2020 at our tertiary care hospital, and who had a prolonged stay with symptoms and signs suggestive of pulmonary fibrosis. HRCT was done to make a diagnosis of pulmonary fibrosis or ILD. Three such patients were identified. RESULTS All the three cases were laboratory proven SARS CoV-2 positive cases and had developed pulmonary fibrosis, with traction bronchiectasis, termed here as PC-ILD (Post Covid-Interstitial Lung Disease). Two of them survived and had improved oxygen saturation on room air at three-month follow-up, while one patient had developed arrhythmia and died. CONCLUSION PC- ILD is one of the emerging complications of COVID-19 pneumonia. A proactive follow-up programme should be undertaken to identify and manage this looming epidemic.","Singh, Ashish Kumar; Kumar, Om Prakash; Bansal, Priya; Margekar, Shubha Laxmi; Aggarwal, Ramesh; Ghotekar, Lekh Raj; Gupta, Ankit",The Journal of the Association of Physicians of India,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34431265/,101
194652,Allied Health Workforce: A Web Of Complexities.,2021,"The spike protein (S) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is responsible for receptor binding and membrane fusion. It contains a highly conserved transmembrane domain that consists of three parts: an N-terminal tryptophan-rich domain, a central domain, and a cysteine-rich C-terminal domain. The cytoplasmic tail of S has previously been shown to be required for assembly. Here, the roles of the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of S in the infectivity and membrane fusion activity of SARS-CoV have been studied. SARS-CoV S-pseudotyped retrovirus (SARSpp) was used to measure S-mediated infectivity. In addition, the cell-cell fusion activity of S was monitored by a Renilla luciferase-based cell-cell fusion assay. S(VSV-Cyt), an S chimera with a cytoplasmic tail derived from vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (VSV-G), and S(MHV-TMDCyt), an S chimera with the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains of mouse hepatitis virus, displayed wild-type-like activity in both assays. S(VSV-TMDCyt), a chimera with the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains of VSV-G, was impaired in the SARSpp and cell-cell fusion assays, showing 3 to 25% activity compared to the wild type, depending on the assay and the cells used. Examination of the oligomeric state of the chimeric S proteins in SARSpp revealed that S(VSV-TMDCyt) trimers were less stable than wild-type S trimers, possibly explaining the lowered fusogenicity and infectivity.","Broer, Rene; Boson, Bertrand; Spaan, Willy; Cosset, François-Loïc; Corver, Jeroen",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16415007/,101

Since July 2003, a number of SARS cases have occurred in China, raising the possibility of future epidemics. We describe here a rapid, sensitive, and highly efficient assay for the detection of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in cultured material and a small number (n = 7) of clinical samples. Using rolling circle amplification (RCA), we were able to achieve sensitive detection levels of SARS-CoV RNA in both solid and liquid phases. The main advantage of RCA is that it can be performed under isothermal conditions with minimal reagents and avoids the generation of false-positive results, a problem that is frequently encountered in PCR-based assays. Furthermore, the RCA technology provides a faster, more sensitive, and economical option to currently available PCR-based methods.","Wang, Bin; Potter, Simon J; Lin, Yiguang; Cunningham, Anthony L; Dwyer, Dominic E; Su, Yuelong; Ma, Xuejun; Hou, Yunde; Saksena, Nitin K",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15872263/,101

This study aimed to assess the expression of NKG2A inhibitory receptor on natural killer (NK) cells and CD8+ T lymphocytes in COVID-19 patients and correlate the results with disease severity defined according to the criteria established by the world health organization, in a trial to understand the immunological response towards COVID-19 infection. The study enrolled 30 COVID-19 patients classified into 2 groups that comprised 15 subjects each; moderate and severe based on clinical, radiological, and laboratory findings. Ten age and sex matched apparently healthy individuals were included in this study as a control group. About 1 ml EDTA anti-coagulated blood samples were collected for measuring expression of NKG2A/CD159a on CD56+ CD3- NK and CD3+CD8+ T cells by flow cytometry. Results revealed that COVID-19 patients had significantly lower NK and CD8+ T cell counts compared to healthy subjects. Severe cases had significantly lower CD8+ T counts compared to moderate ones. Percentages of NK and CD8+T cells expressing NKG2A receptor were significantly higher in cases compared to controls. Comparison between severe and moderate cases revealed that although the percentages of NK cells expressing NKG2A receptor were not significantly higher in severe cases, the mean fluorescence intensity was significantly higher. The percentages of CD8 +T cells expressing NKG2A receptor were significantly higher in severe cases with higher mean fluorescence intensity. In conclusion, our results indicate that elevated NKG2A expression on cytotoxic lymphocytes correlates with disease severity in COVID-19 patients, and may serve as a potential marker for prognosis. Additionally, the blockade of NKG2A should be investigated as means of enhancing NK cell and cytotoxic T cells antiviral immunity in patients with severe COVID-19 infection.","Yasin, Marwa M; Shehata, Iman H; Elsheikh, Nesma G; Elsayed, Marwa S",The Egyptian journal of immunology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34453787/,101

Of the DC subfamilies, plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) are unique in that they secrete high levels of type I IFNs in response to viruses but their role in inducing adaptive immunity remains divisive. In this study, we examined the importance of pDCs and their ability to recognize a virus through TLR9 in immunity against genital HSV-2 infection. We show that a low number of pDCs survey the vaginal mucosa at steady state. Upon infection, pDCs are recruited to the vagina and produce large amounts of type I IFNs in a TLR9-dependent manner and suppress local viral replication. Although pDCs are critical in innate defense against genital herpes challenge, adaptive Th1 immunity developed normally in the absence of pDCs. Thus, by way of migrating directly into the peripheral mucosa, pDCs act strictly as innate antiviral effector cells against mucosal viral infection in situ.","Lund, Jennifer M; Linehan, Melissa M; Iijima, Norifumi; Iwasaki, Akiko",Journal of immunology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17114418/,101

To investigate if this newly discovered virus is associated with acute respiratory infections in pediatric patients in Beijing, tests were developed to detect HCoV-NL63 gene fragments from throat swab and nasopharyngeal aspirates collected from children in outpatient and inpatient departments with ARI in Beijing from Dec. 2003 to Mar. 2004. METHODS A total of 245 clinical samples, which were negative either for diagnostic tests of human respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus A and B, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus 1, 2 and 3 by indirect immunofluorescence assay or human metapneumovirus by RT-PCR, were screened for HCoV-NL63 by nested PCR amplifying gene fragments located on the 1b and 1a genes. Amplicon of PCR from 1a gene of HCoV-NL63 was sequenced and the sequences were compared with those in GenBank nucleotide sequence database. RESULTS Three (1.2%) out of the 245 samples were positive for HCoV-NL63 by nested-PCR using primers on 1b gene. These three samples also showed positive results on nested PCR in which primers were designed with sequences complementary to 1a gene segments. These positive samples were collected from hospitalized children under 2 years of age with pneumonia, bronchiolitis and bronchitis, respectively. The partial 1a gene sequences from two positive samples (BJ3140 and BJ3787) of HCoV-NL63 showed 100% homology between each other and high homology (98%-99%) with the sequences of 1a gene of HCoV-NL63 reported from different countries in GenBank. Phylogenetic analysis showed that BJ3140 and BJ3787 fell into the same genetic cluster (group 1). CONCLUSIONS These data suggest that some of acute respiratory infections in young children in Beijing area are related to the newly identified HCoV-NL63.","Zhu, Ru-nan; Qian, Yuan; Zhao, Lin-qing; Deng, Jie; Wang, Fang; Liao, Bin",Zhonghua er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of pediatrics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16624059/,101

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was designed to investigate 474 nursing students by cluster sampling using a stratified questionnaire from February 15 to March 31, 2020. Multiple linear regression was used to identify the factors affecting professional identity. Binary and multiple logistic regression were used to identify the factors affecting anxiety. RESULTS: Responders with a high level of understanding of COVID-19 and frequent use of behavioral strategies for its prevention comprised 93.2% and 30.0% of the cohort, respectively. Professional identity was significantly associated with gender and anxiety (p < .050). The prevalence of anxiety among nursing students was 12.4%. Male (odds ratio [OR] = 2.39; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.26~4.52), sophomores (OR = 5.30; 95% CI = 1.61~7.45), and infrequent use of prevention measures (OR = 3.49; 95% CI = 1.16~5.19) had a significant effect on anxiety.

Interesting results are obtained for ivermectin, an antiparasitic agent with broad spectrum activity, which gave the highest binding energy value (- 8.8 kcal/mol) against the 3CLpro of SARS-CoV-2 and RdRps of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. The reason for such high binding energy values is probably due to the presence of hydroxy, methoxy and sugar moieties in its structure. The stability of the protein-ligand complexes of polymerase inhibitors considered in this investigation, such as Sofosbuvir, Remdesivir, Tenofovir, Ribavirin, Galidesivir, 5c3, 5h1 and 7a1, show strong to moderate hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions (&#960;-&#960; stacked, &#960;-&#960; T-shaped, &#960;-sigma and &#960;-alkyl). The stability provided from such interactions translate into greater antiviral activity or inhibitory effect of the ligands. Assessment of the average free energies of binding of the FDA approved drugs are highly comparable for conformers of a particular inhibitor, indicating similar modes of binding within the pockets.

204520,Trump versus Biden: a fight for the health of a nation,2020,"The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus causing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is known to lead to the complicated sequelae of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. Proning has been used as an adjunctive treatment to improve oxygenation in both ventilated and non-ventilated patients. Although patients respond well to this strategy, complications from this arise as well. It is hypothesized that COVID-19 intensive care unit (ICU) proned ventilation is associated with new cases of foot drops or compressive unilateral ankle dorsiflexion weakness during the early 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. Five patients presented to an acute rehabilitation facility with unilateral ankle dorsiflexion weakness after ICU proned ventilation during the COVID-19 pandemic. Three patients were found to have primarily subacute left sensory-motor dysmyelinating common peroneal neuropathies located around the fibular head. Two patients were found to have primarily subacute sensory-motor dysmyelinating right-sided common peroneal neuropathies above the fibular head and distal to biceps femoris muscle. Compressive unilateral common peroneal neuropathies during the pandemic are possibly related to the impromptu, unconventional, and unfamiliar use of proned ventilation.","Chang, L.

Quaternary ammonium compounds have been demonstrated to have antiviral effects and may be of use against SARS-CoV-2 infections. DESIGN: In this double-blind, single-center study, we enrolled patients with positive PCR test and/or CT findings for COVID-19. The participants of each group were randomly assigned to Diphenhydramine Compound (Diphenhydramine + Ammonium Chloride) plus standard of care or to Diphenhydramine alone and standard of care groups. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality within 30 days of randomization. Secondary outcomes include viral burden, clinical status, assessed by a 5-point ordinal scale, and length of stay in hospitalized patients. RESULTS: A total of 120 patients were included in the trial, 60 of which were assigned to the Ammonium Chloride group. The primary endpoint was not statistically different between the two groups (HR: 3.02 (95% CI, 0.57-16.06; p = 0.195)). Recovery time and viral burden were significantly lower in the Ammonium Chloride group, corresponding to an odds ratios of 1.8 (95% CI, 1.15-2.83; p = 0.01) and 7.90 (95% CI, 1.62-14.17; p = 0.014), respectively.

207516,Mental health of nursing in coping with COVID-19 at a regional university hospital,2020,"COVID-19 is becoming a leading cause of mortality throughout the world, and few effective therapies are currently available. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is essential to COVID-19 pathogenesis, as the binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S protein) is required for viral entry and development of COVID-19. ACE2 regulates the protective arm of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) that endows anti-hypertensive and anti-inflammatory effects in the cardiovascular and pulmonary systems. Preclinical data suggest ACE2 might be downregulated after SARS-CoV-2 binding, and treatments that increase ACE2 may prevent cardiopulmonary injury. Development, testing, and mass production of novel ACE2 therapies may take years, whereas more effective treatments for COVID-19 are needed urgently. Metformin is a widely available anti-diabetic agent that has an excellent safety profile, and clinical and preclinical data suggest metformin may offer cardiopulmonary protection in COVID-19 via enhanced ACE2 expression.","Malhotra, Atul; Hepokoski, Mark; McCowen, Karen C; Y-J Shyy, John",iScience,,101

210473,Implications of COVID-19: The Effect of Working From Home on Financial and Mental Well-Being in the UK,2021,"T cells of aged people, and of patients with either cancer or severe infections (including COVID-19), are often exhausted, senescent and dysfunctional, leading to increased susceptibilities, complications and mortality. Neurotransmitters and Neuropeptides bind their receptors in T cells, and induce multiple beneficial T cell functions. Yet, T cells of different people vary in the expression levels of Neurotransmitter and Neuropeptide receptors, and in the magnitude of the corresponding effects. Therefore, we performed an individual-based study on T cells of 3 healthy subjects, and 3 Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) patients. HCC usually develops due to chronic inflammation. The inflamed liver induces reduction and inhibition of CD4+ T cells and Natural Killer (NK) cells. Immune-based therapies for HCC are urgently needed. We tested if selected Neurotransmitters and Neuropeptides decrease the key checkpoint protein PD-1 in human T cells, and increase proliferation and killing of HCC cells. First, we confirmed human T cells express all dopamine receptors (DRs), and glutamate receptors (GluRs): AMPA-GluR3, NMDA-R and mGluR. Second, we discovered that either Dopamine, Glutamate, GnRH-II, Neuropeptide Y and/or CGRP (10nM), as well as DR and GluR agonists, induced the following effects: 1. Decreased significantly both %PD-1+ T cells and PD-1 expression level per cell (up to 60% decrease, within 1 h only); 2. Increased significantly the number of T cells that proliferated in the presence of HCC cells (up to 7 fold increase), 3. Increased significantly T cell killing of HCC cells (up to 2 fold increase). 4. Few non-conventional combinations of Neurotransmitters and Neuropeptides had surprising synergistic beneficial effects. We conclude that Dopamine, Glutamate, GnRH-II, Neuropeptide Y and CGRP, alone or in combinations, can decrease % PD-1+ T cells and PD-1 expression per cell, in T cells of both healthy subjects and HCC patients, and increase their proliferation in response to HCC cells and killing of HCC cells. Yet, testing T cells of many more cancer patients is absolutely needed. Based on these findings and previous ones, we designed a novel ""Personalized Adoptive Neuro-Immunotherapy"", calling for validation of safety and efficacy in clinical trials.","Levite, Mia; Safadi, Rifaat; Milgrom, Yael; Massarwa, Muhammad; Galun, Eithan",Neuropeptides,,101
212051,The COVID-19Pandemic in Italy: Policy and Technology Impact on Health and Non-Health Outcomes,2020,"AIMS: The risks associated with diabetes, obesity and hypertension for severe COVID-19 may be confounded and differ by sociodemographic background. We assessed the risks associated with cardiometabolic factors for severe COVID-19 when accounting for socioeconomic factors and in subgroups by age, sex and region of birth. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this nationwide case-control study, 1.086 patients admitted to intensive care with COVID-19 requiring mechanical ventilation (cases), and 10.860 population-based controls matched for age, sex and district of residency were included from mandatory national registries. ORs with 95% CIs for associations between severe COVID-19 and exposures with adjustment for confounders were estimated using logistic regression. The median age was 62 years (IQR 52-70), and 3003 (24.9%) were women. Type 2 diabetes (OR, 2.3 (95% CI 1.9 to 2.7)), hypertension (OR, 1.7 (95% CI 1.5 to 2.0)), obesity (OR, 3.1 (95% CI 2.4 to 4.0)) and chronic kidney disease (OR, 2.5 (95% CI 1.7 to 3.7)) were all associated with severe COVID-19. In the younger subgroup (below 57 years), ORs were significantly higher for all cardiometabolic risk factors. The risk associated with type 2 diabetes was higher in women (p=0.001) and in patients with a region of birth outside European Union(EU) (p=0.004). CONCLUSION: Diabetes, obesity and hypertension were all independently associated with severe COVID-19 with stronger associations in the younger population. Type 2 diabetes implied a greater risk among women and in non-EU immigrants. These findings, originating from high-quality Swedish registries, may be important to direct preventive measures such as vaccination to susceptible patient groups.

Under the auspices of the Canadian Association of Medical Oncologists, we conducted an online national survey to better understand the impact of the pandemic on the medical oncology community in Canada. Methods: An English-language multiple-choice survey, including questions about demographics, covid-19 risk, use of personal protective equipment (ppe), personal challenges, and chemotherapy management was distributed to Canadian medical oncologists. The survey was open from 30 March to 4 April 2020, and attracted 159 responses. Results: More than 70% of medical oncologists expressed moderate-to-extreme concern about personally contracting covid-19 and about family members or patients (or both) contracting covid-19 from them. Despite that high level of concern, considerable variability in the use of ppe in direct cancer care was reported at the time of this survey, with 33% of respondents indicating no routine ppe use at their institutions and 69% indicating uncertainty about access to adequate ppe. Of the respondents, 54% were experiencing feelings of nervousness or anxiety on most days, and 52% were having feelings of depression or hopelessness on at least some days. Concern about aging parents or family and individual wellness represented the top personal challenges identified. The management of cancer patients has been affected, with adoption of telemedicine reported by 82% of respondents, and cessation of clinical trial accrual reported by 54%. The 3 factors deemed most important for treatment decision-making wereâ cancer prognosis and anticipated benefit from treatment,â risk of treatment toxicity during scarce health care access, andâ patient risk of contracting covid-19. Conclusions: This report describes the results of the first national survey assessing the impact of the covid-19 on Canadian medical oncologists and how they deliver systemic anticancer therapies. We hope that these data will provide a framework to address the challenges identified.","Gill, S; Hao, D; Hirte, H; Campbell, A; Colwell, B",Curr Oncol,,101

This drives the necessity to refine and customize reference genomes (RGs). Our laboratory has recently developed a strategy, the Perfect Match Genomic Landscape (PMGL), to detect variation between genomes [K. Palacios-Flores et al. Genetics 208, 1631-1641 (2018)]. The PMGL is precise and sensitive and, in contrast to most currently used algorithms, is nonstatistical in nature. Here we demonstrate the power of PMGL to refine and customize RGs. As a proof-of-concept, we refined different versions of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae RG. We applied the automatic PMGL pipeline to refine the genomes of microorganisms belonging to the three domains of life: the archaea Methanococcus maripaludis and Pyrococcus furiosus; the bacteria Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus subtilis; and the eukarya Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Aspergillus oryzae, and several strains of Saccharomyces paradoxus. We analyzed the reference genome of the virus SARS-CoV-2 and previously published viral genomes from patients' samples with COVID-19. We performed a mutation-accumulation experiment in E. coli and show that the PMGL strategy can detect specific mutations generated at any desired step of the whole procedure. We propose that PMGL can be used as a final step for the refinement and customization of any haploid genome, independently of the strategies and algorithms used in its assembly.","Palacios-Flores, Kim; García-Sotelo, Jair; Castillo, Alejandra; Uribe, Carina; Morales, Lucía; Boege, Margareta; Dávila, Guillermo; Flores, Margarita; Palacios, Rafael",Proc.

While no social strata or population has been spared, the pandemic has posed unique and poorly characterized challenges for individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD). Given the pandemic's broad effects, it is helpful to organize the risks posed to specific populations using theoretical models. These models can guide scientific inquiry, interventions, and public policy. Models also provide a visual image of the interplay of individual-, network-, community-, structural-, and pandemic-level factors that can lead to increased risks of infection and associated morbidity and mortality for individuals and populations. Such models are not unidirectional, in that actions of individuals, networks, communities and structural changes can also affect overall disease incidence and prevalence. In this commentary, we describe how the social ecological model (SEM) may be applied to describe the theoretical effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD).

Despite large numbers of reported seroprevalence studies, there remains a limited understanding of how the magnitude and epitope utilization of the humoral immune response to SARS-CoV-2 viral anti-gens varies within populations following natural infection. Here, we designed a quantitative, multi-epitope protein microarray comprising various nucleocapsid protein structural motifs, including two structural domains and three intrinsically disordered regions. Quantitative data from the microarray provided complete differentiation between cases and pre-pandemic controls (100% sensitivity and specificity) in a case-control cohort (n = 100). We then assessed the influence of disease severity, age, and ethnicity on the strength and breadth of the humoral response in a multi-ethnic cohort (n = 138). As expected, patients with severe disease showed significantly higher antibody titers and interestingly also had significantly broader epitope coverage. A significant increase in antibody titer and epitope coverage was observed with increasing age, in both mild and severe disease, which is promising for vaccine efficacy in older individuals. Additionally, we observed significant differences in the breadth and strength of the humoral immune response in relation to ethnicity, which may reflect differences in genetic and lifestyle factors. Furthermore, our data enabled localization of the immuno-dominant epitope to the C-terminal structural domain of the viral nucleocapsid protein in two independent cohorts. Overall, we have designed, validated, and tested an advanced serological assay that enables accurate quantitation of the humoral response post natural infection and that has revealed unexpected differences in the magnitude and epitope utilization within a population.","Smith, M.; Abdesselem, H.

Thus, providers find it challenging to address patients' dignity, and determine their priorities and preferences for treatments and care, at the patients' final stage of life. AIM: This study explores the culture-specific influences and current understanding of end-of-life (EOL) communication in the Chinese context. METHODS: A qualitative systematic review of qualitative studies was conducted according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. PsycINFO, PubMed and ERIC databases were searched for studies between January 1994 and July 2019, using keywords 'end of life', 'terminal care', 'communication' and 'Chinese'. Included studies were appraised with Critical Appraisal Skills Programme criteria. RESULTS: The search strategy yielded 982 entries and 13 studies were included. Six themes were identified in EOL communication in the Chinese context: (1) Chinese philosophies on the meaning of 'good death'. (2) Negative attitudes towards communication on dying. (3) EOL communication as a taboo topic. (4) Clinician-centred approaches to treatment-decision making. (5) Family expectations being prioritised over patient self-autonomy in prognosis disclosure. (6) Care-providers expressing puzzlement over cultural preferences regarding EOL communication. CONCLUSIONS: The review detailed the complexity of EOL communication in the Chinese context, urging for a communication model distinct from Western-based practices. Future research could explore a validated communication framework that addresses the local culture, thus enabling an understanding of patients' priorities and interpreting EOL encounters from a cross-cultural perspective.","Pun, Jack K H; Cheung, Ka Man; Chow, James C H; Chan, Wing Lok",BMJ support. palliat. care (Online),,101

We focus on common chronic inflammatory skin diseases with complex immunological pathogenesis: psoriasis, eczema including atopic dermatitis, type I allergies, autoimmune blistering and inflammatory connective tissue diseases, vasculitis, and skin cancers. Since several other inflammatory skin diseases display related or comparable immunological reactions, clustering of the various inflammatory dermatoses into different disease patterns may help with therapeutic decisions. Thus, following these patterns of skin inflammation, our review may supply treatment recommendations and thoughtful considerations for disease management even beyond the most frequent diseases discussed here.","Buhl, Timo; Beissert, Stefan; Gaffal, Evelyn; Goebeler, Matthias; Hertl, Michael; Mauch, Cornelia; Reich, Kristian; Schmidt, Enno; Schön, Michael P; Sticherling, Michael; Sunderkötter, Cord; Traidl-Hoffmann, Claudia; Werfel, Thomas; Wilsman-Theis, Dagmar; Worm, Margitta",J.

Various Samhitas, such as Charaka Samhita, Ashtanga Hridaya, Madhava Nidana articles were referred for this study. According to Ayurveda literature, a unique method of impend-ing a fresh identified illness Rather than centring on the bacteriological eti-ology, Ayurveda encirclements a universal skill for particularising the details of the illness at hand. Till the date, no vaccination is being found for COVID-19 yet, but the concepts given in Vedas have information about diagnostic and management. This attempt is to encourage Ayurveda practitioners and young researcher’s to work on the formulations, which are cited thousands of years ago to breakdown the pathology of disease and work for the development and promotion of Ayurveda. © International Journal of Research in Pharmaceutical Sciences.","Rudey, M.

233361,Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global health of women aged 50 to 70 years,2021,"Bacterial infection alters placental ABC transporters expression. These transporters provide fetal protection against circulating xenobiotics and environmental toxins present in maternal blood. We hypothesized that lipopolysaccharide (LPS-bacterial mimic) alters the yolk sac morphology and expression of key ABC transporters in a gestational-age dependent manner. Yolk sac samples from C57BL/6 mice were obtained at gestational ages (GD) 15.5 and GD18.5, 4 or 24 hours after LPS exposure (150ug/kg; n = 8/group). Samples underwent morphometrical, qPCR and immunohistochemistry analysis. The volumetric proportions of the histological components of the yolk sac did not change in response to LPS. LPS increased Abcg2 expression at GD15.5, after 4 h of treatment (p < 0.05). No changes in Abca1, Abcb1a/b, Abcg1, Glut1, Snat1, Il-1ß, Ccl2 and Mif were observed. Il-6 and Cxcl1 were undetectable in the yolk sac throughout pregnancy. Abca1, breast cancer resistance protein (Bcrp, encoded by Abcg2) and P-glycoprotein (P-gp/ Abcb1a/b) were localized in the endodermal (uterine-facing) epithelium and to a lesser extent in the mesothelium (amnion-facing), whereas Abca1 was also localized to the endothelium of the yolk sac blood vessels. LPS increased the labeling area and intensity of Bcrp in the yolk sac's mesothelial cells at GD15.5 (4 h), whereas at GD18.5, the area of Bcrp labeling in the mesothelium (4 and 24 h) was decreased (p < 0.05). Bacterial infection has the potential to change yolk sac barrier function by affecting Bcrp and Abcg2 expression in a gestational-age dependent-manner. These changes may alter fetal exposure to xenobiotics and toxic substances present in the maternal circulation and in the uterine cavity.","Martinelli, L M; Reginatto, M W; Fontes, K N; Andrade, Cbv; Monteiro, Vrs; Gomes, H R; Almeida, Frcl; Bloise, F F; Matthews, S G; Ortiga-Carvalho, T M; Bloise, E",Reprod. toxicol.

235871,The Effects of Covid-19 Pandemic on Syrian Refugees in Turkey: The Case of Kilis,2020,"Introduction: In this prospective, observational study, we have evaluated right (RV) and left (LV) ventricular function with echocardiography and correlated it to the levels of biomarkers, hs-TNT, NT-pro-BNP, D-dimer and fibrinogen. In a subgroup, we have evaluated the effect of inhaled milrinone on RV afterload and function. Methods: Thirty-one ICU patients with COVID-19 in need of mechanical ventilation and norepinephrine infusion were prospec-tively included. Hemodynamic and respiratory variables were measured at the time of the echocardiographic examination and biomarkers were obtained on arrival at the ICU and then followed up routinely. Eight patients received inhaled aerosolized milrinone at a dose of 2.5 mg/hour. Results: The most common echocardiographic pattern was RV dilation with or without systolic dysfunction, which was found in 62% of patients. Pulmonary acceleration time was abnormal in 55% and indices of RV systolic function, such as fractional area of change, RV strain, were abnormal in 30% and 31% of patients respectively. A cardiac index of < 2.5 l/minxm2 was seen in 58% of the patients. Left ventricular ejection fraction and global left ventricular strain were impaired in 10% and 16% respectively. The correlation between echocardiographic variables and cardiac biomarkers was poor. RV afterload correlated well to the levels of D-dimer. Milrinone inhalation did not improve RV function or afterload. Conclusion: RV dysfunction was the most common finding. The poor correlation to cardiac biomarkers argues against extensive myocardial involve-ment. The lack of improvement in RV function after milrinone inhalation suggests that the most likely cause of RV dysfunction is increased RV afterload caused by pulmonary thrombosis/embolism.","Norden, N.; Lundin, E.

238146,Fragmented health systems in COVID-19: rectifying the misalignment between global health security and universal health coverage,2020,"Colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) is one of the important fractions of dissolved organic matter (DOM) that controls the availability of light in water and plays a crucial role in the cycling of carbon. High CDOM absorption in the Mandovi Estuary (Goa) during spring inter-monsoon (SIM) is largely driven by both in-situ production and anthropogenic activities. Here we presented the CDOM variation in the estuary during SIM of 2014 to 2018 and compared it with that of 2020 when the COVID-19 outbreak imposed lockdown was implemented. During 2020, low CDOM absorption was observed at the mid-stream of the estuary as compared to the previous years, which could be attributed to low autochthonous production and less input from anthropogenic activities. On the other hand, high CDOM observed at the mouth during 2020 is linked to the autochthonous production, as seen from the high concentrations of chlorophyll a. High CDOM in the upstream region could be due to both autochthonous production and terrestrially derived organic matter. Sentinel- 2 satellite data was also used to look at the variations of CDOM in the study region which is consistent with in-situ observations. Apart from this, the concentration of nutrients (NO3-, NH4+ and SiO44-) in 2020 was also low compared to the previous reports. Hence, our study clearly showed the impact of anthropogenic activities on CDOM build-up and nutrients, as the COVID-19 imposed lockdown drastically controlled such activities in the estuary.","Dias, Albertina Kurian Siby Thayapurath Suresh Pratihary Anil K.",Frontiers in Marine Science,,101

238905,COVID‐19 Death Rates Are Higher in Rural Counties With Larger Shares of Blacks and Hispanics: Official Journal of the American Rural Health Association and the National Rural Health Care Association,2020,"COVID-19 severity is not only due to the viral infection but also due to the host immune responses. Destructive inflammatory responses are intensely implicated in airway damage. Besides, the massive release of cytokines, including interleukin 1 beta, interleukin 6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha by the immune system, results in a cytokine storm with an aggressive fulminant systemic inflammatory response, organ failure, and septic shock. Evidence suggests that the repressed antioxidant defense and overproduction of reactive oxygen species also have a role in COVID-19 pathogenesis. There is an urgent need for control measures against the overwhelming COVID-19 pandemic regarding antiviral and immune-modulating agents. Wheat bran [WB] has copious amounts of fiber, minerals, thiamine, vitamin B6, folate, and several phytochemicals as phenolic compounds. Wheat bran has anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and antioxidant properties. Our experience of using wheat bran as adjuvant therapy for acute lower respiratory tract infections showed that it was safe, well-tolerated, had fast and superb treatment responses, and improved the patients’ general health. For that reason, we strongly praise using oral wheat bran as adjuvant therapy in COVID-19 cases.","Elsayh, K. I.; El-Badawy, O.; Saad, K.; Zahran, A. M.",Current Trends in Immunology,,101
239092,Using behavioural theory to understand adherence to behaviours that reduce transmission of COVID-19; evidence from the CHARIS representative national study,2021,"Background/AimsLeflunomide, a conventional disease modifying drug (csDMARD), isused in a variety of autoimmune rheumatic diseases (ARD) due to itsimmunomodulating, immunosuppressive and antiproliferative properties. This agent does however confer a greater infection risk and, dueto its long half-life, drug washout procedures are often advised in thecontext of serious infections. Interestingly, Leflunomide is currentlybeing tested as a potential therapy for COVID-19 in the generalpopulation. It is unknown whether leflunomide therapy is associatedwith a poor or favourable outcome among ARD patients infected withCOVID-19.MethodsA Scottish-wide registry was rapidly developed in March 2020. Clinicalcharacteristics and outcomes of infected cases were collated acrossall Scottish health boards. Eligible patients included any adultleflunomide treated ARD patients with a confirmed (clinically or PCR)diagnosis of COVID-19.ResultsOf the 69 cases included in the registry, n = 4 were treated withleflunomide (75% female;mean age 61, SD 4.2). N = 2 were treatedwith combination baricitinib or hydroxychloroquine respectively, whilstn = 1 received recent corticosteroid therapy (intramuscular Kenalog).Comorbidities observed in this sub-cohort include diabetes mellitusn = 3, hypertension n = 2, cardiovascular disease n = 1, lung diseasen = 1 and latent TB n = 1. At presentation, all patients (n = 4)experienced the established COVID-19 related symptom triad ofdyspnoea, cough and fever and promptly developed acute respiratorysyndrome. Diarrhoea was also recorded in n = 2 and constitutionalupset n = 3. All patients suffered a serious COVID-19 disease outcome(defined as a requirement of invasive or non-invasive ventilation (n = 4)and/ or death (n = 2).ConclusionPreliminary data from this Scotland-wide registry has identified only asmall number of leflunomide treated ARD patients infected withCOVID-19. However, it is concerning that all cases experienced aserious outcome. Given the relatively infrequent prescription of thisdrug, combining similar national registry data is necessary to ensurethis observation is not spurious. If confirmed, leflunomide washoutprocedures should be encouraged among such patients when theyfirst present with COVID-19.","Karabayas, M.; Brock, J.; Fordyce, G.; Basu, N.",Rheumatology (United Kingdom),,101

The demand for health and medical related goods increased during this period globally, while the production using classical manufacturing techniques were effected because of the lockdowns and disruption in the transporation system. This created the need of geo scattered, small, and rapid manufacturing units along with a smart computer aided design (CAD) facility. The availability of 3D printing technologies and open source CAD design made it possible to overcome this need. In this article, we present an extensive review on the utilization of 3D printing technology in the days of pandamic. We observe that 3D printing together with smart CAD design show promise to overcome the disruption caused by the lockdown of classical manufacturing units specially for medical and testing equipment, and protective gears. We observe that there are several short communications, commentaries, correspondences, editorials and mini reviews compiled and published; however, a systematic state-of-the-art review is required to identify the significance of 3D printing, design for additive manufacturing (AM), and digital supply chain for handling emergency situations and in the post-COVID era. We present a review of various benefits of 3DP particularly in emergency situations such as a pandemic. Furthermore, some relevant iterative design and 3DP case studies are discussed systematically. Finally, this article highlights the areas that can help to control the emergency situation such as a pandemic, and critically discusses the research gaps that need further research in order to exploit the full potential of 3DP in pandemic and post-pandemic future era.","Nazir, Aamer; Azhar, Aashir; Nazir, Usman; Liu, Yun-Feng; Qureshi, Waqar S; Chen, Jia-En; Alanazi, Eisa",,,101

A Decalogue of Public Health opportunities,2020,"Cape Town was the first city in South Africa to experience the full impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. We acquired samples from all suspected cases and their contacts during the first month of the pandemic from Tygerberg Hospital. Nanopore sequencing generated SARS-CoV-2 whole genomes. Phylogenetic inference with maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods were used to determine lineages that seeded the local epidemic. Three patients were known to have travelled internationally and an outbreak was detected in a nearby supermarket. Sequencing of 50 samples produced 46 high-quality genomes. The sequences were classified as lineages: B, B.1, B.1.1.1, B.1.1.161, B.1.1.29, B.1.8, B.39, and B.40. All the sequences from persons under investigation (PUIs) in the supermarket outbreak (lineage B.1.8) fall within a clade from the Netherlands with good support (p > 0.9). In addition, a new mutation, 5209A>G, emerged within the Cape Town cluster. The molecular clock analysis suggests that this occurred around 13 March 2020 (95% confidence interval: 9-17 March). The phylogenetic reconstruction suggests at least nine early introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into Cape Town and an early localized transmission in a shopping environment. Genomic surveillance was successfully used to investigate and track the spread of early introductions of SARS-CoV-2 in Cape Town.","Engelbrecht, Susan; Delaney, Kayla; Kleinhans, Bronwyn; Wilkinson, Eduan; Tegally, Houriiyah; Stander, Tania; van Zyl, Gert; Preiser, Wolfgang; de Oliveira, Tulio",Viruses,,101

Despite considerable inter-individual variation across bacterial species, the dominant phyla are generally highly conserved. There are several exogenous and gut environmental factors that play a role in modulating the composition and activities of colonic bacteria including diet with intakes of different macronutrients, including protein, accounting for approximately 20% of the microbial variation. Certain bacterial species tend to be considered as generalists and can metabolise a broad range of substrates, including both carbohydrate- and protein-derived substrates, whilst other species are specialists with a rather limited metabolic capacity. Metabolism of peptides and amino acids by gut bacteria can result in the formation of a wide range of metabolites several of which are considered deleterious to health including nitrosamines, heterocyclic amines and hydrogen sulphide as some of these products are genotoxic and have been linked to colonic disease. Beneficial metabolites however include SCFA and certain species can use amino acids to form butyrate which is the major energy source for colonocytes. The impact on health may however depend on the source of these products. In this review, we consider the impact of diet, particularly protein diets, on modulating the composition of the gut microbiota and likely health consequences and the potential impact of climate change and food security.","Duncan, Sylvia H; Iyer, Ajay; Russell, Wendy R",Proc Nutr Soc,,101

252630,One Health: the theory and practice of integrated health approaches,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Cytokine storm syndrome (CTS) is a serious complication of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Treatment and evolution in octogenarians are not well defined. Our objective is to describe its clinical characteristics, the treatments and its clinical evolution. PATIENTS AND METHOD: Retrospective observational study of consecutive patients admitted in the period between March 23 and April 12, 2020 with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, with pneumonia by radiological study or chest tomography, whith STC criteria and who received treatment. We classified patients as those who received only glucocorticoid (GC) pulses, or GC and tocilizumab pulses. We determined serum levels of ferritin, CRP and D-dimers. The final variable was survival. RESULTS: 21 patients, (80-88 years). The mean ferritin was 1056 microg/L (317-3,553), CRP 115.8mg/dL (22-306) and D-dimers 2.9m/L (0.45-17.5). All patients received GC pulses and in 2 cases simultaneously tocilizumab. The mean follow-up time was 13.7 days (8-21). The overall mortality was 38.1% (8/21 patients). The 2 patients who received tocilizumab died. The deceased had significantly higher levels of ferritin (1,254 vs. 925microg/L; P=.045) and CRP (197.6 vs. 76mg / dL; P=.007). At the end of the follow-up, a decrease in the biochemical parameters was observed with ferritin of 727microg/L, CRP of 27mg/dl and D-dimers of 1.18mg/L. In 13/21 patients (61.9%), the CTS was controlled without the need to add other treatments. CONCLUSIONS: STC mortality from SARS-CoV-2 is high despite treatment. A greater inflammatory response was associated with a higher mortality. Although it seems that the early use of GC pulses could control it, and the use of other treatments such as tocilizumab shouldo be, with the study design and its limitations, this conclusion cannot be stablished.","Callejas Rubio, José Luis; Aomar Millán, Ismael; Moreno Higueras, Manuela; Muñoz Medina, Leopoldo; López López, María; Ceballos Torres, Ángel",Rev Esp Geriatr Gerontol,,101

The polypropylene (PP) filter is a representative disposable mask material that traps virus-containing bioaerosols, preventing secondary transmission. In this study, a copper thin film (20 nm) was deposited via vacuum coating on a spunbond PP filter surrounding a KF94 face mask to provide additional protection and lower the risk of secondary transmission. Film adhesion was improved using oxygen ion beam pretreatment, resulting in cuprous oxide formation on the PP fiber without structural deformation. The copper-coated mask exhibited filtration efficiencies of 95.1 ± 1.32% and 91.6 ± 0.83% for NaCl and paraffin oil particles, respectively. SARS-CoV-2 inactivation was evaluated by transferring virus-containing media onto the copper-coated PP filters and subsequently adding Vero cells. Infection was verified using real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunochemical staining. Vero cells added after contact with the copper-coated mask did not express the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and envelope genes of SARS-CoV-2. The SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid immunofluorescence results indicated a reduction in the amount of virus of more than 75%. Therefore, copper-coated antiviral PP filters could be key materials in personal protective equipment, as well as in air-conditioning systems.","Jung, Sunghoon Byeon Eun-Yeon Kim Do-Geun Lee Da-Gyum Ryoo Sungweon Lee Sanggu Shin Cheol-Woong Jang Ho Won Yang Jun-Yeoung Kim Hyo Jung Lee Seunghun",Polymers,,101

To develop precise anticoronavirus drugs and prophylactics, tissue engineering and biomaterial research strategies can serve as a suitable alternative to the conventional treatment options. Therefore, in this Review, we have highlighted various tissue engineering-based diagnostic systems for SARS-CoV-2 and suggested how these strategies involving organ-on-a-chip, organoids, 3D bioprinting, and advanced bioreactor models can be employed to develop in vitro human tissue models, for more efficient diagnosis, drug/vaccine development, and focusing on the need for patient-specific therapy. We believe that combining the basics of virology with tissue engineering techniques can help the researchers to understand the molecular mechanism underlying viral infection, which is critical for effective drug design. In addition, it can also serve to be a suitable platform for drug testing and delivery of small molecules that can lead to therapeutic tools in this dreaded pandemic situation. Additionally, we have also discussed the essential biomaterial properties which polarize the immune system, including dendritic cells and macrophages, toward their inflammatory phenotype, which can thus serve as a reference for exhibiting the role of biomaterial in influencing the adaptive immune response involving B and T lymphocytes to foster a regenerative tissue microenvironment.

METHODS: We conducted a quasi-experimental before-after study. We retrospectively reviewed the medical charts of inpatients with DFI admitted between 1 April 2017 and 31 March 2018 (control group, n = 30). Inpatients diagnosed with DFI between 1 April 2018 and 31 March 2019 were prospectively enrolled as the intervention group and received treatment through dedicated ID teamwork (intervention group, n = 35). RESULTS: The distribution of infection severity and level of metabolic criteria were similar between the groups. Compared with the control group, the intervention group received adequate initial empirical treatment more frequently (43.5% vs 96.8%, p < 0.001), and had a shorter median duration of fever (7.5 vs 1 day, p < 0.001). Rates of healing and relapse within six months were similar between the groups, although the intervention group showed more sites of osteomyelitis (p = 0.036) and a higher percentage of polymicrobial infections (48.6% vs 10.0%, p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: The early and full participation of ID physicians and pharmacists in the treatment of DFI facilitates targeted antimicrobial treatment and improves patient outcomes.","Li, Xiangyan; Qi, Xin; Tian, Shuohan; He, Rui; Jiang, Shan; Li, Huijuan",Int. j. infect. dis,,101

There is currently no drug or vaccine for COVID-19, but it has been revealed that some commercially available drugs are promising, at least for treating symptoms. Among them, remdesivir, which can block the activity of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) in old SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV viruses, has been prescribed to COVID-19 patients in many countries. A recent experiment showed that remdesivir binds to SARS-CoV-2 with an inhibition constant of µM, but the exact target has not been reported. In this work, combining molecular docking, steered molecular dynamics, and umbrella sampling, we examined its binding affinity to two targets including the main protease (Mpro), also known as 3C-like protease, and RdRp. We showed that remdesivir binds to Mpro slightly weaker than to RdRp, and the corresponding inhibition constants, consistent with the experiment, fall to the µM range. The binding mechanisms of remdesivir to two targets differ in that the electrostatic interaction is the main force in stabilizing the RdRp-remdesivir complex, while the van der Waals interaction dominates in the Mpro-remdesivir case. Our result indicates that remdesivir can target not only RdRp but also Mpro, which can be invoked to explain why this drug is effective in treating COVID-19. We have identified residues of the target protein that make the most important contribution to binding affinity, and this information is useful for drug development for this disease.","Nguyen, Hoang Linh; Thai, Nguyen Quoc; Truong, Duc Toan; Li, Mai Suan",J. phys. chem.

265403,Communicating Effectively About Emergency Use Authorization and Vaccines in the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"With the aim of contributing to the fight against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), numerous strategies have been proposed. While developing an effective vaccine can take months up to years, detection of infected patients seems like one of the best ideas for controlling the situation. The role of biosensors in containing highly pathogenic viruses, saving lives and economy is evident. A new competitive numerical platform specifically for designing microfluidic-integrated biosensors is developed and presented in this work. Properties of the biosensor, sample, buffer fluid and even the microfluidic channel can be modified in this model. This feature provides the scientific community with the ability to design a specific biosensor for requested point-of-care (POC) applications. First, the validation of the presented numerical platform against experimental data and then results and discussion, highlighting the important role of the design parameters on the performance of the biosensor is presented. For the latter, the baseline case has been set on the previous studies on the biosensors suitable for SARS-CoV, which has the highest similarity to the 2019 nCoV. Subsequently, the effects of concentration of the targeted molecules in the sample, installation position and properties of the biosensor on its performance were investigated in 11 case studies. The presented numerical framework provides an insight into understanding of the virus reaction in the design process of the biosensor and enhances our preparation for any future outbreaks. Furthermore, the integration of biosensors with different devices for accelerating the process of defeating the pandemic is proposed.","Shahbazi, Fatemeh; Jabbari, Masoud; Esfahani, Mohammad Nasr; Keshmiri, Amir",Biosens Bioelectron,,101

Here, we established an all-in-one cKO system, which enables highly efficient generation of cKO cells and simultaneous gene modifications, including epitope tagging and reporter gene knock-in. We applied this system to mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and generated RNA helicase Ddx1 cKO ESCs. The targeted cells displayed endogenous promoter-driven EGFP and FLAG-tagged DDX1 expression, and they were converted to Ddx1 KO via FLP recombinase. We further established TetFE ESCs, which carried a reverse tetracycline transactivator (rtTA) expression cassette and a tetracycline response element (TRE)-regulated FLPERT2 cassette in the Gt(ROSA26)Sor locus for instant and tightly regulated induction of gene KO. By utilizing TetFE Ddx1F/F ESCs, we isolated highly pure Ddx1F/F and Ddx1-/- ESCs and found that loss of Ddx1 caused rRNA processing defects, thereby activating the ribosome stress-p53 pathway. We also demonstrated cKO of various genes in ESCs and homologous recombination-non-proficient human HT1080 cells. The frequency of cKO clones was remarkably high for both cell types and reached up to 96% when EGFP-positive clones were analyzed. This all-in-one cKO system will be a powerful tool for rapid and precise analyses of gene functions.","Suzuki, Teruhiko; Katada, Eiji; Mizuoka, Yuki; Takagi, Satoko; Kazuki, Yasuhiro; Oshimura, Mitsuo; Shindo, Mayumi; Hara, Takahiko",Nucleic acids res,,101

Using a two-stage transfer learning technique to train a convolutional neural network (CNN), we show that the algorithm is able to classify four classes of disease severity (normal, mild, moderate, and severe) with the average Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.93. In addition, we show that the outputs of different layers of the CNN under dominant filters provide valuable insight about the subtle patterns in the CXRs, which can improve the accuracy in the reading of CXRs by a radiologist. Finally, we show that our approach can be used for studying the disease progression in a single patient and its influencing factors. The results suggest that our technique can form the foundation of a more concrete clinical model to predict the evolution of COVID-19 severity and the efficacy of different treatments for each patient through using CXRs and clinical data in the early stages of the disease. This use of AI to assess the severity and possibly predicting the future stages of the disease early on, will be essential in dealing with the upcoming waves of COVID-19 and optimizing resource allocation and treatment.","Zandehshahvar, Mohammadreza; van Assen, Marly; Maleki, Hossein; Kiarashi, Yashar; De Cecco, Carlo N; Adibi, Ali",Sci Rep,,101

271557,Evaluation of nutritional behaviour related to COVID-19,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, currently poses an urgent global medical crisis for which there remains a lack of affordable point-of-care testing (POCT). In particular, resource-limited areas need simple and easily disseminated testing solutions to manage the outbreak. In this work, a microfluidic-integrated lateral flow recombinase polymerase amplification (MI-IF-RPA) assay was developed for rapid and sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2, which integrates the reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification (RT-RPA) and a universal lateral flow (LF) dipstick detection system into a single microfluidic chip. The single-chamber RT-RPA reaction components are mixed with running buffer, and then delivered to the LF detection strips for biotin- and FAM-labelled amplified analyte sequences, which can provide easily interpreted positive or negative results. Testing requires only a simple nucleic acid extraction and loading, then incubation to obtain results, approximately 30 minutes in total. SARS-CoV-2 armored RNA particles were used to validate the MI-IF-RPA system, which showed a limit of detection of 1 copy per µL, or 30 copies per sample. Chip performance was further evaluated using clinically diagnosed cases of COVID-19 and revealed a sensitivity of 97% and specificity of 100%, highly comparable to current reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-based diagnostic assays. This MI-IF-RPA assay is portable and comprises affordable materials, enabling mass production and decreased risk of contamination. Without the need for specialized instrumentation and training, MI-IF-RPA assay can be used as a complement to RT-PCR for low-cost COVID-19 screening in resource-limited areas.","Liu, Dan; Shen, Haicong; Zhang, Yuqian; Shen, Danyu; Zhu, Mingyang; Song, Yanling; Zhu, Zhi; Yang, Chaoyong",Lab Chip,,101

273925,Family functioning and mental health among secondary vocational students during the COVID-19 epidemic: A moderated mediation model,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Stroke is associated with a rise in post-stroke depression (PSD) and anxiety (PSA). In this study, we evaluated the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the rates of PSD and PSA. METHODS: All stroke admissions to two hospitals in Saudi Arabia during two months were prospectively evaluated for PSD and PSA. NIHSS and serum TSH assessed on admission. PSD and PSA were evaluated using Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Post-stroke disability was assessed by mRS, while social support assessed by Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS). RESULTS: Among 50 participants (28 males), clinically significant PSD was found in 36%, while PSA in 32%. PSD associated with higher NIHSS (P < 0.001); lower MSPSS (P = 0.003); higher mRS (P = 0.001); and discontinuation of rehabilitation (P = 0.02). PSA was associated with higher TSH (P = 0.01); lower MSPSS (Pâ¯=â¯0.03); while discontinuation of rehabilitation was related to less PSA (P = 0.034). Multivariate analysis showed that NIHSS (OR: 1.58, 95% CI: 742-3.37; P = 0.01); and MSPSS score (OR: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.47-0.94; P = 0.002) were associated with PSD; while PSA was related to TSH level (OR: 8.32, 95% CI:1.42-47.23; P = 0.02), and discontinuation of rehabilitation (OR: -0.96, 95% CI: -1.90-0.02; P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Our research shows that the rise in PSD is related to stroke severity and this has not changed significantly during the pandemic; however, PSA showed a noticeable peak. Social deprivation and the lacking levels of rehabilitation related significantly to both.","Ahmed, Zakaria M; Khalil, Mohamed F; Kohail, Ahmed M; Eldesouky, Islam F; Elkady, Ahmed; Shuaib, Ashfaq",J Stroke Cerebrovasc Dis,,101

METHODS: We reviewed the anti-SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG serologic test results and self-reported risk factors for seropositivity among 10,449 asymptomatic HCP who underwent voluntary serology testing between April 20 and May 20, 2020. RESULTS: In total, 136 employees (1.3%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG. This included 41 (30.1%) individuals who had previously tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by nasopharyngeal reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) between March 13 and April 16, 2020. In multivariable analysis, employees of Hispanic ethnicity (OR = 2.01; 95% CI = 1.22-3.46) and those working in environmental services/food services/patient transport (OR = 4.81; 95% CI = 2.08-10.30) were at increased risk for seropositivity compared to other groups. Employees reporting a household contact with COVID-19 were also at higher risk for seropositivity (OR = 3.25; 95% CI = 1.47-6.44), but those with a work exposure were not (OR = 1.27; 95% CI = 0.58-2.47). Importantly, one-third of seropositive individuals reported no prior symptoms, no suspected exposures, and no prior positive RT-PCR test. CONCLUSION: In this study, SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity among HCP early in the northern California epidemic appeared to be quite low and was more likely attributable to community rather than occupational exposure.","Rosser, Joelle I; Röltgen, Katharina; Dymock, Melissa; Shepard, John; Martin, Andrew; Hogan, Catherine A; Blomkalns, Andra; Mathew, Roshni; Parsonnet, Julie; Pinsky, Benjamin A; Maldonado, Yvonne A; Boyd, Scott D; Chang, Sang-Ick; Holubar, Marisa",Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,,101

Methods: Serial samples were collected from patients receiving maintenance haemodialysis (HD). Thirty-nine patients had confirmed COVID-19 and 10 patients had no evidence of COVID-19. Plasma C5a and C3a levels were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: We identified elevated levels of plasma C3a and C5a in HD patients with severe COVID-19 compared with controls. Serial sampling identified that C5a levels were elevated prior to clinical deterioration in patients who developed severe disease. C3a more closely mirrored both clinical and biochemical disease severity. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that activation of complement plays a role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19, leading to endothelial injury and lung damage. C5a may be an earlier biomarker of disease severity than conventional parameters such as C-reactive protein and this warrants further investigation in dedicated biomarker studies. Our data support the testing of complement inhibition as a therapeutic strategy for patients with severe COVID-19.","Prendecki, Maria; Clarke, Candice; Medjeral-Thomas, Nicholas; McAdoo, Stephen P; Sandhu, Eleanor; Peters, James E; Thomas, David C; Willicombe, Michelle; Botto, Marina; Pickering, Matthew C",Clin Kidney J,,101

The main objectives of the present Italian multi-center study were to describe clinical characteristics and role of selected prognostic predictors in a large cohort of young and middle-aged hospitalized patients. Nine pulmonology units, across north and center of Italy, were involved in this retrospective study. Comorbidities were classified according to their known or potential association with COVID-19. A total of 263 subjects were included. The prevalence of obesity was 25.9%, mechanical ventilation (MV) was needed in 27.7%, and 28 in-hospital deaths occurred (10.6%). Obesity and older age were the only independent, significant predictors for MV. Comorbidities, such as hypertension, diabetes, asthma, and increased D-dimer levels were significantly associated with higher mortality risk, regardless of age, body mass index, and MV. Obesity in young and middle-aged adults is a strong predictor of a more complicated COVID-19, without, however, evidence of a significant effect on in-hospital mortality. Selected comorbidities, including hypertension, diabetes and asthma, significantly impact survival even in a younger population, suggesting the need for prompt recognition of these conditions.","Bonifazi, Martina; Mei, Federico; Skrami, Edlira; Latini, Lara Letizia; Amico, Donatella; Balestro, Elisabetta; Bini, Francesco; Bonifazi, Floriano; Caminati, Antonella; Candoli, Piero; Cinti, Saverio; Contucci, Susanna; Di Marco Berardino, Alessandro; Harari, Sergio; Levi, Guido; Lococo, Sara; Menditto, Vincenzo; Marchetti, Giampietro; Piciucchi, Sara; Poletti, Venerino; Ravaglia, Claudia; Saetta, Marina; Svegliati-Baroni, Gianluca; Tomassetti, Sara; Tamburrini, Mario; Zanforlin, Alessandro; Zuccon, Umberto; Zuccatosta, Lina; Gasparini, Stefano; Carle, Flavia",,,101

An analysis from conservation of resources (COR) theory,2021,"PURPOSE: The COVID-19 pandemic has produced an unequaled human crisis forcing a radical reorganization in the healthcare system. Otolaryngologists are at high risk of exposure, and changes in medical and surgical activities have reduced the learning opportunity for residents and fellows. We believe that even during COVID-19 crisis it is mandatory to guarantee an optimal training, and here, we propose some strategies, based on our experience, to further increase our trainees' learning curve. METHODS: We asked our trainees to fill out an electronic survey about several aspect of their training: a first section focused on the reduction of clinical activities and the perceived impact of the pandemic on residents' skills; the second part outlined the type of attended training activity and the perceived benefit. RESULTS: Surgical training has been reported by our residents as the activity perceived to be the most contracted during the pandemic. According to residents' opinion the most useful activities were dissection (n = 8, 53.4% residents) and online journal clubs/webinars (n = 7, 46.6% of residents). Residents' suggestions included actively participating to tracheostomy procedures on SARS-CoV-2 positive patients, attending lessons held by senior consultants on basic ENT topics and promoting collegial discussion of inpatient clinical cases. CONCLUSION: Building on this dramatic experience, we must be ready for a global restructuring of the residency program to provide an adequate trainee education for the future surgeons.","Bandi, Francesco; Karligkiotis, Apostolos; Mellia, Jessica; Gallo, Stefania; Turri-Zanoni, Mario; Battaglia, Paolo; Castelnuovo, Paolo",Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol,,101

Artificial intelligence must also comply with accountability, responsibility, and transparency (ART) requirements for wider acceptability. This paper presents such a patient-centric individualised home-based rehabilitation support system. To this end, the Timed Up and Go (TUG) and Five Time Sit To Stand (FTSTS) tests evaluate daily living activity performance in the presence or development of comorbidities. We present a method for generating synthetic datasets complementing experimental observations and mitigating bias. We present an incremental hybrid machine learning algorithm combining ensemble learning and hybrid stacking using extreme gradient boosted decision trees and k-nearest neighbours to meet individualisation, interpretability, and ART design requirements while maintaining low computation footprint. The model reaches up to 100% accuracy for both FTSTS and TUG in predicting associated patient medical condition, and 100% or 83.13%, respectively, in predicting area of difficulty in the segments of the test. Our results show an improvement of 5% and 15% for FTSTS and TUG tests, respectively, over previous approaches that use intrusive means of monitoring such as cameras.","Vourganas, Ioannis; Stankovic, Vladimir; Stankovic, Lina",Sensors (Basel),,101

Thus far there are no proven therapeutic options to treat COVID-19. We report a case of COVID-19 with acute respiratory distress syndrome who was treated with high-dose vitamin C infusion and was the first case to have early recovery from the disease at our institute. CASE REPORT A 74-year-old woman with no recent sick contacts or travel history presented with fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Her vital signs were normal except for oxygen saturation of 87% and bilateral rhonchi on lung auscultation. Chest radiography revealed air space opacity in the right upper lobe, suspicious for pneumonia. A nasopharyngeal swab for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 came back positive while the patient was in the airborne-isolation unit. Laboratory data showed lymphopenia and elevated lactate dehydrogenase, ferritin, and interleukin-6. The patient was initially started on oral hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. On day 6, she developed ARDS and septic shock, for which mechanical ventilation and pressor support were started, along with infusion of high-dose intravenous vitamin C. The patient improved clinically and was able to be taken off mechanical ventilation within 5 days. CONCLUSIONS This report highlights the potential benefits of high-dose intravenous vitamin C in critically ill COVID-19 patients in terms of rapid recovery and shortened length of mechanical ventilation and ICU stay.

METHODS: In this monocentric retrospective study, the number and the characteristics of patients received for a first consultation for a breast or gynecologic tumor were compared between the containment period and a control period. The times from diagnosis to treatment and the type of initial care were compared too. RESULTS: During the outbreak, 91 patients were seen for a new request, versus 159 during the control period, a decrease of 43.5 %. Patients were older (62.9 versus 60.9 years old) but this difference was not significant. Tumor stage was not modified. Concerning senology, the time from the biopsy to the first consultation was 5.5 days longer during the outbreak (difference statistically insignificant). Among the 51 patients requiring a surgical treatment during the outbreak, 16 (31.48 %) were postponed after the end of the containment measures. After all, the average time from the consultation to the treatment was not modified. No modification of type of treatment was observed. DISCUSSION: At the height of the pandemic, benefits and risks of the cancer treatment had to be daily balanced against the risk of exposition to the COVID-19. The evaluation of practices for cancer care is essential to understand the real impact of COVID-19 outbreak on global cancer management, so as to get prepared to further crises.","Gosset, Marie; Gal, Jocelyn; Schiappa, Renaud; Dejode, Magali; Fouché, Yves; Alazet, Fanny; Roux, Emilie; Delpech, Yann; Barranger, Emmanuel",Bull. cancer,,101

281447,Reimagining the Role of School-Based Health Centers During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: Critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are prone to developing macrothrombosis and microthrombosis. COVID-19 has been reported to be rarely associated with thrombotic microangiopathies. A disintegrin and metalloprotease with thrombospondin type I repeats, member 13 (ADAMTS13) severe deficiency, the hallmark of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), induces the formation of platelet, unusually large von Willebrand factor (VWF) multimer microthrombi. In immune-mediated TTP, ADAMTS13 adopts specifically an open conformation. The VWF/ADAMTS13 couple may contribute to the microthrombi formation in pulmonary alveolar capillaries in COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: To investigate clinical features, hemostatic laboratory parameters, VWF/ADAMTS13 axis, and ADAMTS13 conformation in critically ill COVID-19 patients at admission. METHODS: Fifty three critically ill COVID-19 patients were enrolled between March 18 and May 9 2020 in a monocentric hospital. RESULTS: The median age was 59 years and the male-to-female ratio was 2.8/1. We reported seven pulmonary embolisms and 15 deaths. Biological investigations showed increased fibrinogen and factor V levels, and strongly increased D-dimers correlated with mortality. No patient presented severe thrombocytopenia nor microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. An imbalance between high VWF antigen levels and normal or slightly decreased ADAMTS13 activity levels (strongly elevated VWF/ADAMTS13 ratio) was correlated with mortality. Three patients had a partial quantitative deficiency in ADAMTS13. We also reported a closed conformation of ADAMTS13 in all patients, reinforcing the specificity of an open conformation of ADAMTS13 as a hallmark of TTP. CONCLUSION: We suggest that slightly decreased or normal ADAMTS13 activity and highly elevated VWF are rather biomarkers reflecting both the strong inflammation and the endothelial damage rather than drivers of the thrombotic process of COVID-19.","Joly, Bérangère S; Darmon, Michael; Dekimpe, Charlotte; Dupont, Thibault; Dumas, Guillaume; Yvin, Elise; Beranger, Nicolas; Vanhoorelbeke, Karen; Azoulay, Elie; Veyradier, Agnès",J. thromb. haemost,,101
281449,Reimagining the Role of School‐Based Health Centers During the COVID‐19 Pandemic,2021,"PURPOSE: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, changes to chemotherapy services were implemented as a means of managing imposed workload strains within health services and protecting patients from contracting COVID-19. Given the rapidly evolving nature of the pandemic many changes were rapidly adopted and were not substantiated by robust evidence. This study aimed to describe the changes adopted internationally to chemotherapy services, which may be used to guide future changes to treatment delivery. METHODS: A survey was developed to understand the impact of COVID-19 on the delivery of systemic anti-cancer therapies (SACT). It comprised 22 questions and examined the strategies implemented during the pandemic to prioritise and protect patients receiving SACT and the participants' professional opinion of the strategies employed. The survey was available in English, Spanish and French and was distributed via professional bodies. RESULTS: 129 responses were obtained from healthcare professionals working across 17 different countries. 45% of institutions had to implement treatment prioritisation strategies and all hospitals implemented changes in the delivery of treatment, including: reduction in treatments (69%), using less immunosuppressive agents (50%), allowing treatment breaks (14%) and switching to oral therapies (45%). Virtual clinic visits were perceived by participants as the most effective strategy to protect patients. CONCLUSIONS: The pandemic has forced chemotherapy healthcare professionals to adopt new ways of working by reducing health interactions. Many areas of research are needed following this period, including understanding patients' perceptions of risks to treatment, utilisation of oral treatments and the impact of treatment breaks on cancer outcomes.","Chow, Man-Chie; Chambers, Pinkie; Singleton, Georgina; Patel, Jignesh; Cooper, Silvie; Mythen, Charlotte; Bautista-González, Elysse; Chisnall, Georgia; Djellouli, Nehla; Thwaites, Benjamin; Wong, Ian Ck; Vindrola-Padros, Cecilia",J Oncol Pharm Pract,,101

[2] Aim: The primary aim of this study was to investigate whether the COVID-19 pandemic might impact the psychosocial impact of T1DM and glycaemic control. Methods: During the lockdown to restrict the spread of COVID-19, residents of New South Wales (NSW) were not allowed to leave home except for essential activities. [3] Three months later (July to August 2020) children with T1DM and their parents were invited to complete online questionnaires consisted of 10-14 questions with the use of Likert scale from 1 to 5 (1 being strongly disagreed and 5 being strongly agreed), addressing psychosocial aspects of T1DM in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. Data on glycaemic control pre-and post-COVID pandemic were extracted from the patient's clinical records for those who chose to give their identities. Descriptive and comparative statistics were used to analyse the responses. Results: Out of 149 families, 99 responses were received, with 92 participants identified. 72% of parents felt anxious about diabetes due to added health risks, whereas 45% of children felt worried about getting severe COVID-illness due to diabetes. The responses from parents and children were closely correlated (p &lt; 0.05) except for having clear and concrete goals for diabetes care (p = 0.80). The was no consistent effect of COVID-19 on HbA1C levels, but there was a significant inverse correlation between HbA1C levels during the pandemic and children's prepandemic regular exercise activities. Conclusion: This study found that parents were more anxious generally about diabetes due to added health risks. There were significantly correlated responses between parents and children in most psychosocial aspects except for having clear and concrete goals for diabetes care. The HbA1C levels did not change significantly with the lockdown. Higher pre-pandemic organised physical activity correlated with better pandemic diabetes control. The findings are consistent with the results of a Denmark study that concluded people with diabetes were associated with poorer psychosocial health during the pandemic. [4] Additional studies on psychosocial assessment and intervention are recommended to offer support to parents and children with T1DM.","Neo, E. Y.

We highlight a Monte Carlo method that is useful for computing the drag on biomimetic particles in the free-molecular regime and a numerical technique to compute a (boundary integral solution) of the Stokes equation in the hydrodynamic limit. The free-molecular and the continuum results allow the construction of an approximation for the drag applicable over the full range of Knudsen numbers.

More specifically, we highlight the connection(s) between the environment and the COVID-19 crisis, in particular the intertwined links between Mother Nature and the virus. We then raise some concerns about the ‘illusionary’ positive and negative effects of the crisis on the environment before evoking some past lessons about crisis management and recovery. We contend that the current accounting and accountability mechanisms employed in economic stimulus programs, as well as traditional environmental accounting approaches, are inadequate and limiting to achieve long-term sustainability change. The paper concludes by offering accounting practitioners and researchers some possibilities to take a step forward and develop new understandings of social and environmental value consistent with ecological principles and sustainable development—and hope that these reflections will contribute to a broader debate on the role of accounting for sustainable development in the Anthropocene.","Cho, Charles H.; Senn, Juliette Sobkowiak Madlen",Critical Perspectives on Accounting,,101

(Special issue: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and responses.)",2020,"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It is spread from human to human and has resulted in a global pandemic, posing a disastrous public health risk worldwide. Patients with chronic kidney disease, especially those on dialysis, are considered to be at higher risk of developing severe COVID-19 due to their immunocompromised status and frail condition. The home treatment setting of peritoneal dialysis (PD) has advantages in terms of implementing self-care when routine hospital visits and social activities are restricted, thus greatly reducing exposure of PD patients to the virus. Methods and Results: We outline general operational considerations in PD management during the COVID-19 pandemic, including precautionary measures for PD patients and healthcare staff. Precautionary measures for PD patients include education on prevention of, and screening for, COVID-19, preclinic screening, in-clinic management, meticulous remote patient management and special hospitalization arrangements. The diagnosis and treatment of PD patients with COVID-19 are discussed. Precautionary measures for PD staff include continuous education on, and training in, COVID-19, exposure history surveillance and self-monitoring for COVID-19 among healthcare personnel, appropriate personal protective equipment and hand hygiene, organization of medical activities and staffing, and adequate environment cleaning. Conclusions: This is a battle of the entire human society against the novel coronavirus. Integrated teamwork among healthcare providers, supported by society as a whole, is needed as part of the ongoing public health response to try to slow the spread of COVID-19.","Yang, Zhikai; Dong, Jie",Clin Kidney J,,101

284349,Physical Inactivity During Covid-19 Moderates Body Fat Percentage - Relative Handgrip Strength Relationship On Black Females,2021,"BACKGROUND: Pneumonia is a common respiratory disease. In severe cases, it can induce cardiovascular disease and even life-threatening. In particular, pneumonia caused by the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that broke out at the end of 2019 has seriously affected the health of people in all countries. In recent years, it has been treated with the combination of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) (such as Reduning injection) and Western medicine, and its mortality has decreased significantly. But their efficacy has not been scientifically and systematically assessed. Accordingly, it is essential to provide a systematized review program to estimate the efficacy and safety of Reduning injection combined with Western medicine to treat pneumonia. METHODS: The following databases are retrieved from start to September 2020: Pubmed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Web of Science, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang database, the Chongqing VIP Chinese Science and Technology Periodical Database (VIP) databases, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), and other databases, which are absorbed into clinical RCTs of pneumonia using western medicine alone or plus Reduning injections. The selection of studies, data extraction, and assessment of risk of bias will be performed independently by 2 reviewers. At the same time, Review Manager V.5.3.5 (Rev Man V.5.3.5) was used for bias risk assessment and data synthesis. RESULTS: The efficacy and safety of Reduning injection combined with western medicine in the treatment of pneumonia were evaluated in terms of overall effective rate, the patient's antipyretic time, antitussive time, rales disappearing time, X-ray recovery time, and the incidence of adverse reactions. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides reliable evidence-based support for the clinical application of Reduning injection combined with western medicine for pneumonia. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval is not required in this secondary research evidence, and we will publish the results of this study in a journal or relevant conferences.

Comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) has been proposed as a way to identify and help meet each individual patient’s needs. Patients and Methods: We performed a retrospective review of the results of CGA in an HIV clinic in New York City. CGA included assessment of basic and instrumental activities of daily living, screens for depression, anxiety, frailty, cognition, and quality of life, along with general discussion of concerns and goals. We compared the group of PWH referred for CGA to those of comparable age who were not referred to determine the factors that were associated with referral. We carried out a descriptive analysis of those undergoing CGA, along with regression to determine factors associated with poorer PHQ-2 depression scores and higher VACS score. Results: A total of 105 patients underwent full CGA during the study period. Mean age of referred patients was 66.5 years, ranging from 50 to 84 years (SD 7.99). More than 92% were virally suppressed. Compared with their non-referred counterparts over 50, referred patients were older and had more functional comorbidities like cerebrovascular disease, neuropathy, and urinary incontinence. More than half complained of fatigue, and 2/3 noted poor memory. Almost 60% were frail or prefrail. Ninety patients were asked about their goals, and the most commonly cited were related to health or finances;fifteen patients were unable to articulate any goals. Having fewer goals and noting weight loss or fatigue were predictive of higher scores on the PHQ-2 depression screen. Conclusion: Although most older PWH undergoing CGA can manage their ADL, many have concerns and deficits beyond their comorbidities. CGA offers an important window into the psychosocial concerns and needs of older PWH.","Siegler, Eugenia L.; Moxley, Jerad H.; Glesby, Marshall J.",HIV/AIDS : Research and Palliative Care,,101

This approach does not adequately acknowledge the fact that social media discourse is distributed across a wide range of hashtags. To assess such 'width of discourse', we examine the extent to which dominant hashtags in the UK Covid-19 Instagram discourse connect with hashtags related to different aspects of social life. A network of Instagram hashtags (31,742 nodes and 107,367 edges) constructed using #nhsheroes, #captaintommoore, and #carehomes as key access points was analysed. Results showed that top nodes in the network representing these and other topics related to the pandemic are highly intertwined. Moreover, results revealed that despite connections among each other, hubs in this network tend to connect more with low degree frames, connecting secondary hashtags to the Covid-19 searchable discourse. Results revealed that a diverse set of local structures consisting of secondary frames are nested within pandemic related communities. © 2021 IEEE Computer Society.

More recently, an increasing body of evidence suggests that IL-36 plays a crucial role in viral, bacterial and fungal infections. There is a growing interest as to whether IL-36 contributes to host protective immune responses against infection as well as the potential implications of IL-36 for the development of new therapeutic strategies. In this review, we summarize the recent progress in understanding cellular expression, regulatory mechanisms and biological roles of IL-36 in infectious diseases, which suggest more specific strategies to maneuver IL-36 as a diagnostic or therapeutic target, especially in COVID-19.","Wang, Xiaofang; Yi, Panpan; Liang, Yuejin",Front Immunol,,101

294155,Understanding health spending for SDG 3,2020,"We present optimality results for robust Kalman filtering where robustness is understood in a distributional sense, i.e.; we enlarge the distribution assumptions made in the ideal model by suitable neighborhoods. This allows for outliers which in our context may be system-endogenous or -exogenous, which induces the somewhat conflicting goals of tracking and attenuation. The corresponding minimax MSE-problems are solved for both types of outliers separately, resulting in closed-form saddle-points which consist of an optimally-robust procedure and a corresponding least favorable outlier situation. The results are valid in a surprisingly general setup of state space models, which is not limited to a Euclidean or time-discrete framework. The solution however involves computation of conditional means in the ideal model, which may pose computational problems. In the particular situation that the ideal conditional mean is linear in the observation innovation, we come up with a straight-forward Huberization, the rLS filter, which is very easy to compute. For this linearity we obtain an again surprising characterization.","Ruckdeschel, Peter",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1004.3393v1.pdf,101
294503,The Perfect Storm: Coronavirus (Covid-19) Pandemic Meets Overfat Pandemic,2020,"Effective countermeasures against the SARS-CoV-2 demand a better understanding of the pathogen-host interactions. However, such information about the targets, responses, and effects in the host due to the virus is limited, especially so in the case of newly emerged pathogens. The peptide domains that form the interfaces of host and pathogen interacting proteins being evolutionarily conserved, it may be hypothesized that such interactions can be inferred from the similarities in the nucleotide sequences between the host and the pathogen. This communication reports the results of a study based on a parsimonious approach for the identification of the host-virus interactions, where sequence complementarity between the human and SARS-Cov-2 genomes was used to predict several interactions between the host and SARS-CoV-2 at different levels of biological organization. In particular, the findings are suggestive of a direct effect of SARS-CoV-2 on cardiac health. The existing literature on host responses to SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses attest to many of these predicted interactions, supporting the utility of the proposed approach for the identification of host interactions with other novel pathogens.

To the best of our knowledge, no appropriate surrogate for SARS-CoV-2 has been identified or confirmed for chlorine and antimicrobial surface disinfection. We completed a study to evaluate the efficacy of two hypothesized antimicrobial surfaces, and four chlorine solutions on nonporous and porous surfaces, against SARS-CoV-2 and three potential SARS-CoV-2 surrogates [coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and bacteriophages Phi6 and MS2], to identify a BSL-1 or BSL-2 virus to use in future studies. We found SARS-CoV-2 can be reduced >4 log10 on porous and nonporous surfaces within 30 s upon exposure to 0.5% NaOCl. The results indicate coronavirus MHV-GFP is inactivated faster than SARS-CoV-2 (MHV-GFP ≥ 6.08 log10;SARS-CoV-2 = 0.66 log10 at 30 s with 0.05% NaOCl on steel) and MS2 is inactivated more slowly. Phi6 is inactivated like SARS-CoV-2, and we propose Phi6 as a slightly conservative surrogate for SARS-CoV-2 chlorine disinfection. Additionally, disinfection of bacteriophages on wood was challenging, and exposure to antimicrobial surfaces had no disinfection efficacy as tested. We recommend using 0.5% chlorine on surfaces for a minimum of 30 s of contact to disinfect SARS-CoV-2 and recommend additional research on Phi6 disinfection with varied surfaces and conditions.","String, Gabrielle M.; White, Mitchell R.; Gute, David M.; Mühlberger, Elke Lantagne Daniele S.",Environmental science & technology letters,,101

Methods In this study, 105 hospitalized patients suspected of having COVID-19 were evaluated. Finally, the laboratory and HRCT and related factors data of 83 confirmed cases by HRCT and RT-PCR were analyzed. To compare the median of quantitative variables in the two groups, the Mann-Whitney U test was used. Also, to determine the factors associated with the positiveness of the HRCT result, a univariate logistic model was fitted. Moreover, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed to test the ability of the final model to predict the positiveness of HRCT result. Results 61.40% of the patients had a comorbidity disease. 89.20% had fever, 92.00% cough, 91.40% dyspnea. Abnormal CRP was seen in 77.80% of the patients, followed by 66.70% lymphopenia, and 60.30% neutrophilia. Also, ALP (abnormal vs. normal) and score of HRCT assessment variables had a significant effect on the positiveness of HRCT findings. 87.95% had abnormal HRCT with 41% bilateral multi lobar patchy ground glass opacity (GGO).

Deep learning is an effective tool in the elaboration of medical imaging. We wanted to evaluate the role of a convolutional neural network as a support tool for kidney immunofluorescence reporting. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: High-magnification (×400) immunofluorescence images of kidney biopsies performed from the year 2001 to 2018 were collected. The report, adopted at the Division of Nephrology of the AOU Policlinico di Modena, describes the specimen in terms of ""appearance,"" ""distribution,"" ""location,"" and ""intensity"" of the glomerular deposits identified with fluorescent antibodies against IgG, IgA, IgM, C1q and C3 complement fractions, fibrinogen, and &#954;- and &#955;-light chains. The report was used as ground truth for the training of the convolutional neural networks. RESULTS: In total, 12,259 immunofluorescence images of 2542 subjects undergoing kidney biopsy were collected. The test set analysis showed accuracy values between 0.79 (""irregular capillary wall"" feature) and 0.94 (""fine granular"" feature). The agreement test of the results obtained by the convolutional neural networks with respect to the ground truth showed similar values to three pathologists of our center. Convolutional neural networks were 117 times faster than human evaluators in analyzing 180 test images. A web platform, where it is possible to upload digitized images of immunofluorescence specimens, is available to evaluate the potential of our approach. CONCLUSIONS: The data showed that the accuracy of convolutional neural networks is comparable with that of pathologists experienced in the field.","Ligabue, Giulia; Pollastri, Federico; Fontana, Francesco; Leonelli, Marco; Furci, Luciana; Giovanella, Silvia; Alfano, Gaetano; Cappelli, Gianni; Testa, Francesca; Bolelli, Federico; Grana, Costantino; Magistroni, Riccardo",Clin J Am Soc Nephrol,,101

Recently, miRNAs have been viewed as important modulators of viral infections they can function as suppressors of gene expression by targeting cellular or viral RNAs during infection. Aim of Review: We describe the biological roles and effects of miRNAs on SARS-CoV-2 life-cycle and pathogenicity, and we discuss the modulation of the immune system with micro-RNAs which would serve as a new foundation for the treatment of SARS-COV2 and other viral infections. Key Scientific Concepts of Review: miRNAs are the key players that regulate the expression of the gene in the post-transcriptional phase and have important effects on viral infections, thus are potential targets in the development of novel therapeutics for the treatment of viral infections. Besides, micro-RNAs (miRNAs) modulation of immune-pathogenesis responses to viral infection is one of the most-known indirect effects, which leads to suppressing of the interferon (IFN-&#945;/ß) signalling cascade or upregulation of the IFN-&#945;/ß production another IFN-stimulated gene (ISGs) that inhibit replication of the virus. These virus-mediated alterations in miRNA levels lead to an environment that might be either enhance or inhibit virus replication.","Abu-Izneid, Tareq; AlHajri, Noora; Mohammed Ibrahim, Abdallah; Noushad Javed, Md; Mustafa Salem, Khairi; Hyder Pottoo, Faheem; Amjad Kamal, Mohammad",,,101

This paper focuses on the application of deep learning (DL) models to medical imaging and drug discovery for managing COVID-19 disease. In this article, we detail various medical imaging-based studies such as X-rays and computed tomography (CT) images along with DL methods for classifying COVID-19 affected versus pneumonia. The applications of DL techniques to medical images are further described in terms of image localization, segmentation, registration, and classification leading to COVID-19 detection. The reviews of recent papers indicate that the highest classification accuracy of 99.80% is obtained when InstaCovNet-19 DL method is applied to an X-ray dataset of 361 COVID-19 patients, 362 pneumonia patients and 365 normal people. Furthermore, it can be seen that the best classification accuracy of 99.054% can be achieved when EDL_COVID DL method is applied to a CT image dataset of 7500 samples where COVID-19 patients, lung tumor patients and normal people are equal in number. Moreover, we illustrate the potential DL techniques in drug or vaccine discovery in combating the coronavirus. Finally, we address a number of problems, concerns and future research directions relevant to DL applications for COVID-19. © 2021 MIR Labs. All Rights Reserved.","Bharati, S.; Podder, P.; Mondal, M.

305560,Assessments on the impact of the health crisis on the economic environment in Romania from the perspective of foreign trade activity,2020,"The fast spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) constitutes a worldwide challenge to the public health, educational and trade systems, affecting the overall well-being of human societies. The high transmission and mortality rates of this virus, and the unavailability of a vaccine or treatment, resulted in the decision of multiple governments to enact measures of social distancing. Such measures can reduce the exposure to bioaerosols, which can result in pathogen deposition in the respiratory tract of the host causing disease and an immunological response. Thus, it is important to consider the validity of the proposal for keeping a distance of at least 2 m from other persons to avoid the spread of COVID-19. This work reviews the effect of aerodynamic diameter (size) of particles carrying RNA copies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). A SARS-CoV-2 carrier person talking, sneezing or coughing at distance of 2 m can still provide a pathogenic bioaerosol load with submicron particles that remain viable in air for up to 3 h for exposure of healthy persons near and far from the source in a stagnant environment. The deposited bioaerosol creates contaminated surfaces, which if touched can act as a path to introduce the pathogen by mouth, nose or eyes and cause disease.","Guzman, Marcelo I",Int. j. health plann. manage,,101

This study documents the presenting characteristics, treatment modalities and outcomes of the first 32 COVID-19 patients in Nigeria. Methods: this retrospective study used medical records of the first 32 patients admitted and discharged from the Mainland Hospital, Lagos State, southwest Nigeria between February 27 and April 6, 2020. The outcomes of interest were death, promptness of admission process and duration of hospitalization. Results: the mean age of the patients was 38.1 years (SD: 15.5) and 66% were male. Three-quarters (75%) of the patients presented in moderately severe condition while 16% were asymptomatic. The most common presenting symptoms were fever (59%) and dry cough (44%). The mean time between a positive test result and admission was 1.63 days (SD: 1.31). Almost all (97%) the patients were treated with lopinavir-ritonavir with no recorded death. The median duration of hospital stay was 12 days (IQR: 9-13.5). Conclusion: in this preliminary analysis of the first COVID-19 cases in Nigeria, clinical presentation was mild to moderate with no mortality. Processes to improve promptness of admission and reduce hospital stay are required to enhance the response to COVID-19 in Nigeria.","Bowale, Abimbola; Abayomi, Akin; Idris, Jide; Omilabu, Sunday; Abdus-Salam, Ismail; Adebayo, Busayo; Opawoye, Folarin; Finnih-Awokoya, Ore; Zamba, Emmanuella; Abdur-Razzaq, Hussein; Erinoso, Olufemi; Onasanya, Tosin; Ramadan, Patrick; Nyenyi, Sam; Aniaku, Evaristus; Balogun, Muhammad; Okunromade, Oyeladun; Adejumo, Olusola; Adesola, Sunday; Ogunniyan, Tope; Balogun, Mobolanle; Osibogun, Akin",Pan Afr.

The principle of measurement depends on the computation of reflectance, absorbance and transmittance of virus based quantum dot solution. In this paper, the reflectance is studied through the analysis of photonic band gap and absorbance is made through its numerical treatment. Further, the numerical investigation shows that the transmitted energy through photonic structure would determine the type of corona virus. For example; if the transmitted energy lies within the visible spectrum the sample would be normal corona virus. However, the sample could be IBV (SARS COV-2) if the transmitted energy would be Infrared.","Mohanty, Sangram Kishore; Das, Subhankar; Swain, K P; Bhanja, Urmila; Palai, G",Microsyst Technol,,101

While mAbs are traditionally screened and selected based on potency of neutralization in vitro, it is clear that additional factors contribute to the in vivo efficacy of a mAb beyond viral neutralization. These factors include interactions with Fc receptors (FcRs) and complement that can enhance neutralization, clearance of infected cells, opsonization of virions, and modulation of the innate and adaptive immune response.

However, the environmental consequences associated with the temporary shutdown and recovery of industrial and commercial activities are still not fully understood. Using the well-known carbon footprint (CF) indicator, this paper provides a comprehensive estimation of environmental effects due to the COVID-19 outbreak lockdown measures in Italy. Our aim was to quantify the CF associated with the consumption of energy by any economic activity and region in Italy during the lockdown, and then compare these environmental burdens with the CF calculated for analogous periods from 2015 to 2019 (~March and April). Complementarily, we also conducted a scenario analysis to estimate the post-lockdown CF impact in Italy. A consumption-based approach was applied according to the principles of the established Life Cycle Assessment method. The CF was therefore quantified as a sum of direct and indirect greenhouse gases (GHGs) released from domestically produced and imported energy metabolism flows, excluding the exports. Our findings indicate that the CF in the lockdown period is ~-20% lower than the mean CF calculated for the past. This means avoided GHGs in between ~5.6 and ~10.6 Mt CO2e. Results further suggest that a tendency occurs towards higher impact savings in the Northern regions, on average ~230 kt CO2e of GHGs avoided by province (against ~110-130 kt CO2e in central and Southern provinces). Not surprisingly, these are the utmost industrialized areas of Italy and have been the ones mostly affected by the outbreak. Despite our CF estimates are not free of uncertainties, our research offers quantitative insights to start understanding the magnitude generated by such an exceptional lockdown event in Italy on climate change, and to complement current scientific efforts investigating the relationships between air pollution and the spread of COVID-19.","Rugani, Benedetto; Caro, Dario",Sci Total Environ,,101

We show how these new fissures interact with existing inequalities along various key dimensions, including socio-economic status, education, age, gender, ethnicity and geography. We find that the deep underlying inequalities and policy challenges that we already had are crucial in understanding the complex impacts of the pandemic itself and our response to it, and that the crisis does in itself have the potential to exacerbate some of these pre-existing inequalities fairly directly. Moreover, it seems likely that the current crisis will leave legacies that will impact inequalities in the long term.

We aimed to develop and to validate a simple clinical prediction rule for early identification of in-hospital mortality of patients with COVID-19. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We enrolled 2191 consecutive hospitalized patients with COVID-19 from three Italian dedicated units (derivation cohort: 1810 consecutive patients from Bergamo and Pavia units; validation cohort: 381 consecutive patients from Rome unit). The outcome was in-hospital mortality. Fine and Gray competing risks multivariate model (with discharge as a competing event) was used to develop a prediction rule for in-hospital mortality. Discrimination and calibration were assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and by Brier score in both the derivation and validation cohorts. Seven variables were independent risk factors for in-hospital mortality: age (Hazard Ratio [HR] 1.08, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 1.07-1.09), male sex (HR 1.62, 95%CI 1.30-2.00), duration of symptoms before hospital admission <10 days (HR 1.72, 95%CI 1.39-2.12), diabetes (HR 1.21, 95%CI 1.02-1.45), coronary heart disease (HR 1.40 95% CI 1.09-1.80), chronic liver disease (HR 1.78, 95%CI 1.16-2.72), and lactate dehydrogenase levels at admission (HR 1.0003, 95%CI 1.0002-1.0005).

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop and validate machine learning models based on clinical features to assess the risk of severe disease and triage for COVID-19 patients upon hospital admission. METHODS: This retrospective multicenter cohort study included patients with COVID-19 who were released from quarantine until April 30, 2020, in Korea. A total of 5628 patients were included in the training and testing cohorts to train and validate the models that predict clinical severity and the duration of hospitalization, and the clinical severity score was defined at four levels: mild, moderate, severe, and critical. RESULTS: Out of a total of 5601 patients, 4455 (79.5%), 330 (5.9%), 512 (9.1%), and 301 (5.4%) were included in the mild, moderate, severe, and critical levels, respectively. As risk factors for predicting critical patients, we selected older age, shortness of breath, a high white blood cell count, low hemoglobin levels, a low lymphocyte count, and a low platelet count. We developed 3 prediction models to classify clinical severity levels. For example, the prediction model with 6 variables yielded a predictive power of >0.93 for the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. We developed a web-based nomogram, using these models. CONCLUSIONS: Our prediction models, along with the web-based nomogram, are expected to be useful for the assessment of the onset of severe and critical illness among patients with COVID-19 and triage patients upon hospital admission.","Oh, Bumjo; Hwangbo, Suhyun; Jung, Taeyeong; Min, Kyungha; Lee, Chanhee; Apio, Catherine; Lee, Hyejin; Lee, Seungyeoun; Moon, Min Kyong; Kim, Shin-Woo; Park, Taesung",J Med Internet Res,,101

A plethora of studies, globally, have suggested the existence of a sex disparity in the outcome of COVID-19 patients, that is mainly due to mechanisms of viral infection, immune response to the virus, development of a hyperinflammation, and development of systemic complications, particularly thromboembolism. These differences appear to be more pronounced in elderly COVID-19 patients. Epidemiological data report a sex difference in the severity and outcome of COVID-19 disease with a more favourable course of the disease in women compared to men, regardless of age range although the rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection seems to be similar in both sexes. Sex hormones, including androgens and estrogens, may not only impact viral entry and load, but also shape the clinical manifestations, complications and, ultimately, the outcome of COVID-19 disease. The current review comprehensively summarizes current literature on sex disparities in susceptibility and outcomes of COVID-19 disease as well as the literature underpinning the pathophysiological and molecular mechanisms, which may provide a rationale to a sex disparity. These include sex hormone influences on molecules that facilitate virus entry and priming, as well as the immune and inflammatory response, as well as coagulation and thrombosis diathesis. Based on present evidence, women appear to be relatively protected from COVID-19 because of a more effective immune response and a less pronounced systemic inflammation, with consequent moderate clinical manifestations of the disease, together with a lesser predisposition to thromboembolism. Conversely, men appear to be particularly susceptible to COVID-19 disease because of a less effective immune response with consequent increased susceptibility to infections, together with a greater predisposition to thromboembolism. In elderlies, sex disparities in overall mortality following SARS-CoV-2 infection is even more palpable, as elderly men appear more prone to severe COVID-19 because of a greater predisposition to infections, a weaker immune defence and an enhanced thrombotic state compared to women. The review highlights potential novel therapeutic approaches employing the administration of hormonal or anti-hormonal therapy in combination with antiviral drugs in COVID-19 patients.","Pivonello, Rosario; Auriemma, Renata S; Pivonello, Claudia; Isidori, Andrea M; Corona, Giovanni; Colao, Annamaria; Millar, Robert P",Neuroendocrinology,,101

Conversely, men appear to be particularly susceptible to COVID-19 disease because of a less effective immune response with consequent increased susceptibility to infections, together with a greater predisposition to thromboembolism. In elderlies, sex disparities in overall mortality following SARS-CoV-2 infection is even more palpable, as elderly men appear more prone to severe COVID-19 because of a greater predisposition to infections, a weaker immune defence and an enhanced thrombotic state compared to women. The review highlights potential novel therapeutic approaches employing the administration of hormonal or anti-hormonal therapy in combination with antiviral drugs in COVID-19 patients.","Pivonello, Rosario; Auriemma, Renata S; Pivonello, Claudia; Isidori, Andrea M; Corona, Giovanni; Colao, Annamaria; Millar, Robert P",Neuroendocrinology,,101
316258,"Predicting Hospital Demand During the COVID-19 Outbreak in Bogotá, Colombia",2020,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Airway management in patients outside the operating room is associated with increased difficulties and risks, and the setting of the COVID-19 global pandemic adds another layer of complexity. Therefore, endotracheal intubation (ETT) of a patient who is presumptive COVID-19 or COVID-19 positive presents an additional challenge to an anesthesiologist. The aim of this review is to summarize the important principles of airway management outside of the operating room during the COVID-19 pandemic. RECENT FINDINGS: Several professional societies have formulated guidelines on airway management COVID-19 suspect and proven patients. Additionally, anesthesiologists working in hospitals treating many infected patients have developed specialized teams responsible for airway management outside the operating room. These documents and protocols focus on the importance of wearing personal protective equipment and the skills of the providers responsible for securing the airway. Staff safety is always a priority when performing ETT outside operating room. SUMMARY: The COVID-19 pandemic redefined the management of patients requiring aerosol generating procedures (droplet and airborne precautions). ETT is one of them and anesthesiologists are experts in performing airway management. Although the operating room is a highly controlled environment, airway management outside of this setting is not always the easiest task.","Lee, Delice Weishan; Ma, Martin; Parotto, Matteo; Wasowicz, Marcin",Curr Opin Anaesthesiol,,101

317113,COVID-19 mortality rates in Northamptonshire UK: initial sub-regional comparisons and provisional SEIR model of first wave disease spread,2021,"Most studies on well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic have focused on the mental health of the general population; far less attention has been given to more specific populations, such as patients with mental illness. Indeed, it is important to examine the psychiatric population, given its vulnerability. The present study aimed at assessing the psychological and emotional impact of isolation on patients in Residential Rehabilitation Communities, compared to healthy controls. A questionnaire was administered cross-sectionally on an online survey platform and both psychiatric patients and healthy controls accessed via a designed link. The results showed significant differences between psychiatric patients and controls on Anxiety, Stress, Worry, and Risk Perception variables. Psychiatric patients scored lower on Stress compared to healthy controls and higher on Anxiety, Perceived Risk of getting infected with COVID-19 and Worry about the emergency situation. The results showed that, during the Italian lockdown, psychiatric patients living in residential communities received unbroken support from peers and mental health professionals, maintained their usual medication treatment, and were informed of COVID-19 consequences. This finding provides insight into the differences between residential and healthy populations and highlights the importance of continuous support for psychiatric patients, especially during stressful situations such as a pandemic.","Burrai, Jessica; Roma, Paolo; Barchielli, Benedetta; Biondi, Silvia; Cordellieri, Pierluigi; Fraschetti, Angelo; Pizzimenti, Alessia; Mazza, Cristina; Ferracuti, Stefano; Giannini, Anna Maria",,,101

Participants: Students at a large 4-year college in Midwestern USA. Methods: We conducted a photo-survey of students' experiences during the lockdown. Student researchers and faculty collaborated to analyze images and texts in a way that privileged students' interpretation. Results: Students frequently reported worsening mental health during the lockdown. Nonacademic aspects of students' lives such as work and the home environment significantly contributed to perceived stress. Students, especially freshmen coped maladaptively with unmet psychosocial and educational needs. Faculty may underestimate the indirect impact of the pandemic on students' lives and academic outcomes. Conclusion: Perspectives presented herein add the crucial voice of students to ongoing conversations to meet pandemic-related mental health needs of college students.","Olson, Reilly; Fryz, Rylin; Essemiah, Judith; Crawford, Miranda; King, Adedipupo; Fateye, Babasola",J Am Coll Health,,101
318455,Nurse Expertise: A Critical Resource in the COVID-19 Pandemic Response,2020,"COVID-19 can result in severe disease characterized by significant immunopathology that is spurred by an exuberant, yet dysregulated, innate immune response with a poor adaptive response. A limited and delayed interferon I (IFN-I) and IFN-III response results in exacerbated proinflammatory cytokine production and in extensive cellular infiltrates in the respiratory tract, resulting in lung pathology. The development of effective therapeutics for patients with severe COVID-19 depends on our understanding of the pathological elements of this unbalanced innate immune response. Here, we review the mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 both activates and antagonizes the IFN and inflammatory response following infection, how a dysregulated cytokine and cellular response contributes to immune-mediated pathology in COVID-19, and therapeutic strategies that target elements of the innate response.","Lowery, Shea A; Sariol, Alan; Perlman, Stanley",Cell host microbe,,101

MATERIALS AND METHODS: From March 2020 to December 2020, 56 consecutive children (33 males and 23 girls; mean age ± SD, 14.8 ± 5.0 years; range, 9 months-18 years) with mild to moderate symptom and laboratory confirmed COVID-19 (based on Centers for Disease Control criteria) underwent both chest radiography and chest CT on the same day within the first 2 days of initial presentation to the hospital. Two experienced radiologists independently evaluated chest radiographs and chest CT studies for thoracic abnormalities. The findings from chest radiography and chest CT were compared to evaluate the added diagnostic value of chest CT for affecting patient management. Interobserver agreement was measured with Cohen's &#954; statistics. RESULTS: Eleven (19.6%) of 56 patients had abnormal chest radiographic findings, including ground-glass opacity (GGO) in 5/11 (45.4%) and combined GGO and consolidation in 6/11 (54.5%). On chest CT, 26 (46.4%) of 56 patients had abnormal CT findings, including combined GGO and consolidation in 19/26 (73.1%), GGO in 6/26 (23.1%), and consolidation in 1/26 (3.8%). Chest CT detected all thoracic abnormalities seen on chest radiography in 11/26 (42.3%) cases. In 15/26 (57.7%), chest CT detected lung abnormalities that were not observed on chest radiography, which included GGO and consolidation in 9/15 (60%), GGO in 5/15 (33.3%), and consolidation in 1/15 (6.6%) cases. These additional CT findings did not affect patient management. In addition, chest CT detected radiological signs and patterns, including the halo sign, reversed halo sign, crazy paving pattern, and tree-in-bud pattern. There was almost perfect interobserver agreement between the two reviewers for detecting findings on both chest radiographs (&#954;, 0.89, p = .001) and chest CT (&#954;, 0.96, p = .001) studies. CONCLUSION: Chest CT detected lung abnormalities, including GGO and/or consolidation, that were not observed on chest radiography in more than half of symptomatic pediatric patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. However, these additional CT findings did not affect patient management. Therefore, CT is not clinically indicated for the initial evaluation of mild to moderately symptomatic pediatric patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.","Das, Karuna M; Alkoteesh, Jamal A; Al Kaabi, Jumaa; Al Mansoori, Taleb; Winant, Abbey J; Singh, Rajvir; Paraswani, Rajesh; Syed, Rizwan; Sharif, Elsadeg M; Balhaj, Ghazala B; Lee, Edward Y",Pediatr. pulmonol,,101

Sera from acutely infected and convalescent COVID-19 patients exhibited a 3-fold reduction in binding antibody titers to the B.1.351 variant receptor-binding domain of the spike protein and a 3.5-fold reduction in neutralizing antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2 B.1.351 variant compared to the B.1 variant. Similar results were seen with sera from Moderna-vaccinated individuals.

325539,Ensuring contact: calling rural Appalachian older adults during the COVID-19 epidemic,2021,"In Drosophila, nutrient status is sensed by the fat body, a functional homolog of mammalian liver and white adipocytes. The fat body conveys nutrient information to insulin-producing cells through humoral factors which regulate Drosophila insulin-like peptide levels and insulin signalling. Insulin signalling has pleiotropic functions, which include the management of growth and metabolic pathways. Here, we report that Edem1 (endoplasmic reticulum degradation-enhancing &#945;-mannosidase-like protein 1), an endoplasmic reticulum-resident protein involved in protein quality control, acts in the fat body to regulate insulin signalling and thereby the metabolic status in Drosophila Edem1 limits the fat body-derived Drosophila tumor necrosis factor-&#945; Eiger activity on insulin-producing cells and maintains systemic insulin signalling in fed conditions. During food deprivation, edem1 gene expression levels drop, which aids in the reduction of systemic insulin signalling crucial for survival. Overall, we demonstrate that Edem1 plays a vital role in helping the organism to endure a fluctuating nutrient environment by managing insulin signalling and metabolic homeostasis.","Pathak, Himani; Varghese, Jishy",,,101

To address this, we analyzed the relationship between in vitro neutralization levels and the observed protection from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection using data from seven current vaccines and from convalescent cohorts. We estimated the neutralization level for 50% protection against detectable SARS-CoV-2 infection to be 20.2% of the mean convalescent level (95% confidence interval (CI) = 14.4-28.4%). The estimated neutralization level required for 50% protection from severe infection was significantly lower (3% of the mean convalescent level; 95% CI = 0.7-13%, P = 0.0004). Modeling of the decay of the neutralization titer over the first 250 d after immunization predicts that a significant loss in protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection will occur, although protection from severe disease should be largely retained. Neutralization titers against some SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern are reduced compared with the vaccine strain, and our model predicts the relationship between neutralization and efficacy against viral variants. Here, we show that neutralization level is highly predictive of immune protection, and provide an evidence-based model of SARS-CoV-2 immune protection that will assist in developing vaccine strategies to control the future trajectory of the pandemic.","Khoury, David S; Cromer, Deborah; Reynaldi, Arnold; Schlub, Timothy E; Wheatley, Adam K; Juno, Jennifer A; Subbarao, Kanta; Kent, Stephen J; Triccas, James A; Davenport, Miles P",Nat. med,,101

329755,Reducing risks to children during the pandemic,2020,"BackgroundResidents in care homes have been severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. We describe trends in risk of mortality among care home residents compared to residents in private homes in England. MethodsOn behalf of NHS England, we used OpenSAFELY-TPP, an analytics platform running across the linked electronic health records of approximately a third of the English population, to calculate monthly age-standardised risks of death due to all causes and COVID-19 among adults aged >=65 years between 1/2/2019 and 31/03/2021. Care home residents were identified using linkage to the Care and Quality Commission. FindingsWe included 4,329,078 people aged 65 years or older on the 1st of February 2019, 2.2% of whom were classified as residing in a care or nursing home. Age-standardised mortality risks were approximately 10 times higher among care home residents compared to non-residents in February 2019 residents (CMF = 10.59, 95%CI = 9.51, 11.81 among women, CMF = 10.82, 95%CI = 9.89, 11.84 among men). This increased to more than 17 times in April 2020 (CMF = 17.52, 95%CI = 16.38, 18.74 among women, CMF = 18.12, 95%CI = 17.17 - 19.12 among men) before returning to pre-pandemic levels in June 2020. CMFs did not increase during the second wave, despite a rise in the absolute age-standardised COVID-19 mortality risks. InterpretationThe first COVID-19 wave had a disproportionate impact on care home residents in England compared to older private home residents. A degree of immunity, improved protective measures or changes in the underlying frailty of the populations may explain the lack of an increase in the relative mortality risks during the second wave. The care home population should be prioritised for measures aimed at controlling the spread of COVID-19.

331745,Optimistic bias and preventive behavioral engagement in the context of COVID-19,2020,"CD9, a 24 kDa tetraspanin membrane protein, is known to regulate cell adhesion and migration, cancer progression and metastasis, immune and allergic responses, and viral infection. CD9 is upregulated in senescent endothelial cells, neointima hyperplasia, and atherosclerotic plaques. However, its role in cellular senescence and atherosclerosis remains undefined. We investigated the potential mechanism for CD9-mediated cellular senescence and its role in atherosclerotic plaque formation. CD9 knockdown in senescent human umbilical vein endothelial cells significantly rescued senescence phenotypes, while CD9 upregulation in young cells accelerated senescence. CD9 regulated cellular senescence through a phosphatidylinositide 3 kinase-AKT-mTOR-p53 signal pathway. CD9 expression increased in arterial tissues from humans and rats with age, and in atherosclerotic plaques in humans and mice. Anti-mouse CD9 antibody noticeably prevented the formation of atherosclerotic lesions in ApoE-/- mice and Ldlr-/- mice. Furthermore, CD9 ablation in ApoE-/- mice decreased atherosclerotic lesions in aorta and aortic sinus. These results suggest that CD9 plays critical roles in endothelial cell senescence and consequently the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, implying that CD9 is a novel target for prevention and treatment of vascular aging and atherosclerosis.","Cho, Jung Hee; Kim, Eok-Cheon; Son, Youlim; Lee, Da-Woon; Park, Yong Seop; Choi, Joon Hyuk; Cho, Kyung-Hyun; Kwon, Ki-Sun; Kim, Jae-Ryong",Cell death differ,,101

(Special issue: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and responses.),2020,"BACKGROUND: As frontline providers of care, nurses and midwives play a critical role in controlling infections such as COVID-19, influenza, multi-drug resistant organisms and health care associated infections. Improved cleaning can reduce the incidence of infection and is cost effective but relies on healthcare personnel to correctly apply cleaning measures. As nurses and midwives have the most contact with patients and as an important first step in improving compliance, this study sought to explore nurses' and midwives' knowledge on the role of the environment in infection prevention and control and identify challenges in maintaining clean patient environments. METHODS: Cross-sectional online survey of 96 nurses (RN/EN) and midwives (RW) employed in clinical settings (e.g. hospital, aged care, medical centre, clinic) in Australia. RESULTS: Nurses and midwives broadly stated that they understood the importance of cleaning. However, cleaning responsibilities varied and there was confusion regarding the application of different disinfectants when cleaning after patients with a suspected or diagnosed infection post-discharge. Most would not be confident being placed in a room where a previous patient had a diagnosed infection such as multi-drug resistant organism. CONCLUSION: Greater organisational support and improving applied knowledge about infection control procedures is needed. This includes correct use of disinfectants, which disinfectant to use for various situations, and cleaning effectively following discharge of a patient with known infection. The cleanliness of shared medical equipment may also pose current risk due to lack of cleaning.","Mitchell, Brett G; Russo, Philip L; Kiernan, Martin; Curryer, Cassie",Infect. Dis. Health,,101

As neoadjuvant therapy has become a standard for triple negative and HER2+ EBC, it focusses on luminal EBC. RECENT FINDINGS: Gene expression assays have become standard of care in luminal EBC, at least for patients with node negative disease. Two prospective randomized clinical trials, TAILORx (Oncotype DX) and MINDACT (MammaPrint) have presented additional analyses underlining the clinical utility of the tests. In times of COVID-19, immunohistochemically determined ER, PR, and Ki67 and early Ki67 response to endocrine therapy can be used to safely allocate patients for preoperative endocrine therapy and delay surgeries if resources are scarce. In patients with luminal high-risk disease, adding a CDK 4/6 inhibitor (abemaciclib) improves patient outcome already after short-term follow-up. SUMMARY: Determination of recurrence risk will remain important in luminal EBC for optimal therapy decisions. In the future, risk-adapted treatment concepts will include decision making for chemotherapy but also for endocrine-based approaches.","Harbeck, Nadia",Curr Opin Obstet Gynecol,,101

333721,Development of a Remote Public Health Advanced Pharmacy Practice Experience in Response to COVID-19,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is a major global public threat. Currently, a worldwide effort has been mounted to generate billions of effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine doses to immunize the world's population at record speeds. However, there is still a demand for alternative effective vaccines that rapidly confer long-term protection and rely upon cost-effective, easily scaled-up manufacturing. Here, we present a Sindbis alphavirus vector (SV), transiently expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (SV.Spike), combined with the OX40 immunostimulatory antibody (&#945;OX40) as a novel, highly effective vaccine approach. We show that SV.Spike plus &#945;OX40 elicits long-lasting neutralizing antibodies and a vigorous T-cell response in mice. Protein binding, immunohistochemical, and cellular infection assays all show that vaccinated mice sera inhibits spike functions. Immunophenotyping, RNA Seq transcriptome profiles, and metabolic analysis indicate a reprogramming of T cells in vaccinated mice. Activated T cells were found to mobilize to lung tissue. Most importantly, SV.Spike plus &#945;OX40 provided robust immune protection against infection with authentic coronavirus in transgenic mice expressing the human ACE2 receptor (hACE2-Tg). Finally, our immunization strategy induced strong effector memory response, potentiating protective immunity against re-exposure to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Our results show the potential of a new Sindbis virus-based vaccine platform to counteract waning immune response, which can be used as a new candidate to combat SARS-CoV-2. Given the T-cell responses elicited, our vaccine is likely to be effective against variants that are proving challenging, as well as serve as a platform to develop a broader spectrum pancoronavirus vaccine. Similarly, the vaccine approach is likely to be applicable to other pathogens.","Scaglione, Antonella; Opp, Silvana; Hurtado, Alicia; Lin, Ziyan; Pampeno, Christine; Noval, Maria G; Thannickal, Sara A; Stapleford, Kenneth A; Meruelo, Daniel",Front Immunol,,101

COVID-19 patients with hypertension were enrolled to evaluate the effect of RAS inhibitors. We observed that patients receiving ACEI or ARB therapy had a lower rate of severe diseases and a trend toward a lower level of IL-6 in peripheral blood. In addition, ACEI or ARB therapy increased CD3 and CD8 T cell counts in peripheral blood and decreased the peak viral load compared to other antihypertensive drugs. This evidence supports the benefit of using ACEIs or ARBs to potentially contribute to the improvement of clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients with hypertension.","Meng, Juan; Xiao, Guohui; Zhang, Juanjuan; He, Xing; Ou, Min; Bi, Jing; Yang, Rongqing; Di, Wencheng; Wang, Zhaoqin; Li, Zigang; Gao, Hong; Liu, Lei; Zhang, Guoliang",Emerg Microbes Infect,,101

In this sense, we applied the Rapid Assessment Surveys (RAS) on natural and artificial hard substrates during the most intense drought period (between 2014 and 2016) since 1950, in a tropical estuary in Eastern Brazil. Through the estuary salinization the ascidian Didemnum psammatodes overgrow the dominant native taxa; this dominance taxa shift provided suitable habitat favorable for invasion of Ophiothela mirabilis across the estuary. Even the invasion starts on artificial substrates, the higher resilience of natural substrates were not enough to enable the establishment of invasive species. This baseline is the first evidence of bioinvasion influenced by climate change drought periods in tropical estuaries in South America, which is a great advance for the development of management strategies to mitigate this and future climate change scenarios.","Gomes, Luiz Eduardo de Oliveira; da Silva, Eder Carvalho",Mar Pollut Bull,,101
340218,An evaluation of enhanced surveillance of hospitalised COVID-19 patients to inform the public health response in Victoria,2020,"ABSTRACT: COVID-19 pandemic caused a major crisis, affecting and straining health care systems, including some very advanced ones. The pandemic may have also indirectly affected access to health care for patients with other conditions, not related to COVID-19, even in countries not overwhelmed by an outbreak.We analyzed and compared visits to the emergency room (ER) department during the same calendar period of 2019 and 2020 (from March 1 to March 31 of each year) in our hospital, a medium size, tertiary center, located in the center of Athens, which is not a referral center for COVID-19.Total ER visits were reduced by 42.3% and the number of those requiring hospitalization by 34.8%. This reduction was driven by lower numbers of visits for low risk, non-specific symptoms and causes. However, there was a significant decrease in admissions for cardiovascular symptoms and complications (chest pain of cardiac origin, acute coronary syndromes, and stroke) by 39.7% and for suspected or confirmed GI hemorrhage by 54.7%. Importantly, number of ER visits for infections remained unchanged, as well as the number of patients that required hospitalization for infection management; only few patients were diagnosed with COVID-19.During the initial period of the pandemic and lock-down in Greece, there was a major decrease in the patients visiting ER department, including decrease in the numbers of admissions for cardiovascular symptoms and complications. These observations may have implications for the management of non-COVID-19 diseases during the pandemic.","Kastritis, Efstathios; Tsitsimpis, Konstantinos; Anninos, Ektoras; Stamatelopoulos, Kimonas; Kanakakis, Ioannis; Lampropoulos, Christos; Chatzidou, Sofia; Michopoulos, Spyros; Papamichail, Christos; Kostis, Evangelos; Manios, Efstathios; Kontogiannis, Sofoklis; Paraskevaidis, Ioannis; Terpos, Evangelos; Mitrakou, Asimina; Dimopoulos, Meletios A",Medicine (Baltimore),,101

Psychological first aid (PFA) is promoted by public health authorities to provide psychological support in the context of extreme events; however, there is limited evidence for its effectiveness. As a prerequisite to conducting a randomised controlled trial to examine programme effectiveness, this project is evaluating the acceptability and feasibility of implementing and evaluating a PFA training programme ('LIVES for Families') for mental health (MH) practitioners to improve their ability to recognise and respond to COVID-19-related psychological distress among their clients. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We are using a triangulation mixed methods research design; complementary strands of quantitative and qualitative data are being collected in parallel and will be merged at the interpretation phase of the project. The quantitative strand uses a repeated measures design; a consecutive sample of MH practitioners (n=80) providing MH support to young people or their families are being recruited to participate in the LIVES for Families PFA training programme and complete quantitative measures at baseline (pretraining), 2-week and 6-month follow-up time points. The qualitative strand uses fundamental description and semistructured interviews with a subset of practitioners (n=30), as well as managers of MH agencies (n=20). A mixed methods joint display and associated narrative will generate a comprehensive understanding regarding acceptability and feasibility. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The Hamilton Integrated Research Ethics Board approved the study (project number: 11295). Results will be shared broadly with the policy and practice community through publications, presentations and public webinars. As a brief, evidence-informed intervention, the LIVES for Families PFA training programme is suitable in its mode of delivery across care settings. The outcomes of this study could have international implications for mitigating the MH impacts of viral pandemics.","Kimber, Melissa; Harms, Sheila; Soreni, Noam; Inrig, Maggie; Acai, Anita; Lipman, Ellen Louise; Sassi, Roberto; Streiner, David L; MacMillan, Harriet L",BMJ Open,,101

A total of 235 participants randomly received either a newspaper article about the COVID-19 virus or Germany's soil condition and were asked to indicate their current level of the perceived threat of the virus and the use of different coping strategies. Results indicate that the cognitive availability of COVID-19 information leads to a higher perceived threat, leading to more seeking for social support. Although neither self-efficacy nor intolerance of uncertainty moderates the effect of cognitive availability on the perceived threat, both personality characteristics moderated the relationship between perceived threat and different coping strategies. We discuss our results in line with current research on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on coping strategies and well-being.","Klümper, Lisa; Sürth, Svenja",Curr Psychol,,101

350598,Effect on mental health issues during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: Efficient and early triage of hospitalized Covid-19 patients to detect those with higher risk of severe disease is essential for appropriate case management. METHODS: We trained, validated, and externally tested a machine-learning model to early identify patients who will die or require mechanical ventilation during hospitalization from clinical and laboratory features obtained at admission. A development cohort with 918 Covid-19 patients was used for training and internal validation, and 352 patients from another hospital were used for external testing. Performance of the model was evaluated by calculating the area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity and specificity. RESULTS: A total of 363 of 918 (39.5%) and 128 of 352 (36.4%) Covid-19 patients from the development and external testing cohort, respectively, required mechanical ventilation or died during hospitalization. In the development cohort, the model obtained an AUC of 0.85 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.82 to 0.87) for predicting severity of disease progression. Variables ranked according to their contribution to the model were the peripheral blood oxygen saturation (SpO2)/fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) ratio, age, estimated glomerular filtration rate, procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, updated Charlson comorbidity index and lymphocytes. In the external testing cohort, the model performed an AUC of 0.83 (95% CI, 0.81 to 0.85). This model is deployed in an open source calculator, in which Covid-19 patients at admission are individually stratified as being at high or non-high risk for severe disease progression. CONCLUSIONS: This machine-learning model, applied at hospital admission, predicts risk of severe disease progression in Covid-19 patients.","Marcos, Miguel; Belhassen-García, Moncef; Sánchez-Puente, Antonio; Sampedro-Gomez, Jesús; Azibeiro, Raúl; Dorado-Díaz, Pedro-Ignacio; Marcano-Millán, Edgar; García-Vidal, Carolina; Moreiro-Barroso, María-Teresa; Cubino-Bóveda, Noelia; Pérez-García, María-Luisa; Rodríguez-Alonso, Beatriz; Encinas-Sánchez, Daniel; Peña-Balbuena, Sonia; Sobejano-Fuertes, Eduardo; Inés, Sandra; Carbonell, Cristina; López-Parra, Miriam; Andrade-Meira, Fernanda; López-Bernús, Amparo; Lorenzo, Catalina; Carpio, Adela; Polo-San-Ricardo, David; Sánchez-Hernández, Miguel-Vicente; Borrás, Rafael; Sagredo-Meneses, Víctor; Sanchez, Pedro-Luis; Soriano, Alex; Martín-Oterino, José-Ángel",PLoS One,,101
352433,Impact of lockdown following COVID-19 on the gaming behavior of college students,2020,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the extent to which public support for outbreak containment policies varies with respect to the severity of an infectious disease outbreak. METHODS: A web-enabled survey was administered to 1017 residents of Singapore during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, and was quota-sampled based on age, sex, and ethnicity. A fractional-factorial design was used to create hypothetical outbreak vignettes characterised by morbidity and fatality rates, and local and global spread of an infectious disease. Each respondent was asked to indicate which response policies (among five policies restricting local movement and four border control policies) they would support in five randomly assigned vignettes. Binomial logistic regressions were used to predict the probabilities of support as a function of outbreak attributes, personal characteristics, and perceived policy effectiveness. RESULTS: Likelihood of support varied across government response policies but was generally higher for border control policies compared with internal policies. The fatality rate was the most important factor for internal policies, while the degree of global spread was the most important for border control policies. In general, individuals who were less healthy, had higher-income, and were older were more likely to support these policies. Perceived effectiveness of a policy was a consistent and positive predictor of public support. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that campaigns to promote public support should be designed specifically to each policy and tailored to different segments of the population. They should also be adapted based on the evolving conditions of the outbreak in order to receive continued public support.","Ozdemir, Semra; Tan, Si Ning Germaine; Chaudhry, Isha; Malhotra, Chetna; Finkelstein, Eric Andrew",Patient,,101

Now is the time for action,2020,"OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were (i) to describe the clinical presentation, treatment and outcome of paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally related to Sars-CoV-2 (PIMS-TS) in children; (ii) to propose a framework to guide multidisciplinary team (MDT) management; and (iii) to highlight the role of the paediatric rheumatologist in this context. METHODS: This study involved a retrospective case notes review of patients referred to a single specialist paediatric centre with suspected PIMS-TS, with a focus on clinical presentation, laboratory parameters, treatment, and outcome in the context of an MDT framework. RESULTS: Nineteen children of median age 9.1 years fulfilled the definition of PIMS-TS and were managed within an MDT framework: 5/19 were female; 14/19 were of Black, Asian or minority ethnicity; 9/19 also fulfilled diagnostic criteria for complete or incomplete Kawasaki disease (KD). Severe systemic inflammation, shock, and abdominal pain were ubiquitous. Treatment was stratified within an MDT framework and included CSs in all; i.v. immunoglobulin in all; anakinra in 4/19; infliximab in 1/19; and antiviral (aciclovir) in 4/19. CONCLUSIONS: We observed significant diagnostic equipoise using a current definition of PIMS-TS, overlapping with KD. Outside of clinical trials, an MDT approach is vital.

In view of this scenario, this research aims to explore the effectiveness of population mobility restriction in alleviating epidemic transmission during different stages of the outbreak. Taking Shenzhen, a city with a large immigrant population in China, as a case study, the real-time reproduction number of COVID-19 is estimated by statistical methods to represent the dynamic spatiotemporal transmission pattern of COVID-19. Furthermore, migration data between Shenzhen and other provinces are collected to investigate the impact of nationwide population flow on near-real-time dynamic reproductive numbers. The results show that traffic flow control between populated cities has an inhibitory effect on urban transmission, but this effect is not significant in the late stage of the epidemic spread in China. This finding implies that the government should limit international and domestic population movement starting from the very early stage of the outbreak. This work confirms the effectiveness of travel restriction measures in the face of COVID-19 in China and provides new insight for densely populated cities in imposing intervention measures at various stages of the transmission cycle.","Ji, Honglu; Tong, Huan; Wang, Jingge; Yan, Dan; Liao, Zangyi; Kong, Ying",,,101

The purpose of this article is to provide a broad historical perspective and to contextualize the meaning of full employment in a COVID-19 world and possible aftermath. In opposition to the view of many economists and policy makers on both the Right and Left of the political spectrum, the article affirms that a full-employment policy is not passé. What we have learned from the COVID-19 crisis is that a full-employment commitment ought to be coupled with a “full” or universal basic income system.

The databases of the Departments of Hematology and Oncology of the University Hospitals of Jena and Rostock were screened for patients aged 18 years or older for onset of MS after HSCT for myeloid malignancies between 2002 and 2019. Nineteen patients with MS were identified, the majority of whom had received reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC). The median onset of MS was 425 days after HSCT and the median overall survival since MS was 234 days. Although MS is associated with a poor prognosis, three patients survived more than two years and one more than 11 years after MS onset. These results indicate that RIC protocols may be associated with a higher risk of EM relapse. Since EM relapse occurred in the presence of Graft-versus-host-disease, these observations also demonstrate the limitations of graft-versus-tumor effects after HSCT. In conclusion, occurrence of MS after HSCT is associated with a poor prognosis, as multimodal curative concepts including intensive chemotherapy and another HSCT are often not viable.","Frietsch, Jochen J; Hunstig, Friederike; Wittke, Christoph; Junghanss, Christian; Franiel, Tobias; Scholl, Sebastian; Hochhaus, Andreas; Hilgendorf, Inken",Bone marrow transplant,,101

The main search engines were PubMed, SciELO, and Google Scholar. Twelve articles were selected to develop the bibliographic review by applying pre-established inclusion and exclusion criteria. Precautionary measures should be applied to control COVID-19 in clinical practice. Several authors have highlighted the importance of telephone triage and/or clinic questionnaires, body temperature measurement, usage of personal protective equipment, surface disinfection with ethanol between 62% and 71%, high-speed instruments equipped with an anti-retraction system, four-handed work, and large-volume cannulas for aspiration. Clinically, the use of a rubber dam is essential. FFP2 (or N95) and FFP3 respirators, if compared to surgical masks, provide greater protection for health workers against viral respiratory infections.

OBJECTIVE: This study assessed sociodemographic predictors of the use and trust of different COVID-19 information sources, as well as the association between information sources and knowledge and beliefs about the pandemic. METHODS: An online survey was conducted among US adults in two rounds during March and April 2020 using advertisement-based recruitment on social media. Participants were asked about their use of 11 different COVID-19 information sources as well as their most trusted source of information. The selection of COVID-related knowledge and belief questions was based on past empirical literature and salient concerns at the time of survey implementation. RESULTS: The sample consisted of 11,242 participants. When combined, traditional media sources (television, radio, podcasts, or newspapers) were the largest sources of COVID-19 information (91.2%). Among those using mainstream media sources for COVID-19 information (n=7811, 69.5%), popular outlets included CNN (24.0%), Fox News (19.3%), and other local or national networks (35.2%). The largest individual information source was government websites (87.6%). They were also the most trusted source of information (43.3%), although the odds of trusting government websites were lower among males (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 0.58, 95% CI 0.53-0.63) and those aged 40-59 years and &#8805;60 years compared to those aged 18-39 years (AOR 0.83, 95% CI 0.74-0.92; AOR 0.62, 95% CI 0.54-0.71). Participants used an average of 6.1 sources (SD 2.3). Participants who were male, aged 40-59 years or &#8805;60 years; not working, unemployed, or retired; or Republican were likely to use fewer sources while those with children and higher educational attainment were likely to use more sources. Participants surveyed in April were markedly less likely to use (AOR 0.41, 95% CI 0.35-0.46) and trust (AOR 0.51, 95% CI 0.47-0.56) government sources. The association between information source and COVID-19 knowledge was mixed, while many COVID-19 beliefs were significantly predicted by information source; similar trends were observed with reliance on different types of mainstream media outlets. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 information source was significantly determined by participant sociodemographic characteristics and was also associated with both knowledge and beliefs about the pandemic. Study findings can help inform COVID-19 health communication campaigns and highlight the impact of using a variety of different and trusted information sources.","Ali, Shahmir H; Foreman, Joshua; Tozan, Yesim; Capasso, Ariadna; Jones, Abbey M; DiClemente, Ralph J",JMIR Public Health Surveill,,101

Few studies have been conducted examining the psychological effect of COVID-19 on health-care worker psychological health in Jordan. Therefore, the present study aims to assess the respective levels of fear, anxiety, depression, stress, social support, and the associated factors, experienced by Jordanian health-care workers during the COVID-19 Pandemic. This study adopted a cross-sectional, correlational design to collect data from 365 health-care workers in Amman, Jordan, from August 16th to 23rd, 2020. Along with collecting sociodemographic characteristics, the Fear of COVID-19 Scale, the Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale, and the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support electronically administered to participants. The majority of the participants (69.3%) were registered nurses. The mean overall score for the Fear of COVID-19 scale was 23.64 (SD + 6.85) which again exceeded the mid-point for the total score range (21), indicating elevated level fear of the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants had displayed extremely severe depression 40%, extremely severe anxiety 60%, and 35% severely distressed. Scores for depression (21.30 ± 10.86), anxiety (20.37 ± 10.80), stress (23.33 ± 10.87) were also high. Factors determined to be associated with psychological distress were being male, married, aged 40 years and older, and having more clinical experience. Assessment of social support indicated moderate-to-high levels of perceived support for all dimensions (significant other: 5.17 ± 1.28, family: 5.03 ± 1.30, friends: 5.05 ± 1.30). Weak significant correlations were found between social support and the other study variables (r < 0.22), indicating a weak association with fear, depression, anxiety, and stress, respectively. Overall, Jordanian health-care workers sample reported fear, depression, anxiety, and stress. The associated factors were being male, married, aged 40 years and older, and having more clinical experience. Regarding social support, participants primarily relied on support from their families, followed by support from friends.","Alnazly, Eman; Khraisat, Omar M; Al-Bashaireh, Ahmad M; Bryant, Christine L",PLoS One,,101

368700,We Need Compassionate Leadership Management Based on Evidence to Defeat COVID-19,2020,"Memory interventions for older adults with cognitive concerns result in improved memory performance and maintenance of cognitive health. These programs are typically delivered face-to-face, which is resource intensive and creates access barriers, particularly for those with reduced mobility, limited transportation, and living in rural or remote areas. The COVID-19 pandemic has created an additional access barrier, given the increased risk this disease poses to older adults. Internet-based interventions seek to overcome these barriers. This paper describes the protocol of a pilot study that aims to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of one such internet-based intervention: the Online Personalised Training in Memory Strategies for Everyday (OPTIMiSE) program. OPTIMiSE focuses on improving knowledge regarding memory and providing training in effective memory strategies for everyday life. The pilot study described in this protocol will be a single-arm pre-post study of 8 weeks duration, with a single maintenance session 3 months post-intervention. Participants will be Australian adults aged &gt;= 60 years reporting cognitive changes compared with 10 years ago. Primary outcome measures will address feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy. Secondary outcome measures assessing sense of community and self-efficacy will be administered at the 8-week and 3-month timepoints. Data collection will conclude mid-2021, and results will be presented in a subsequent publication. Translation of memory interventions to internet-based delivery has the potential to remove many access barriers for older adults;however, the acceptability and feasibility of this modality needs investigation. OPTIMiSE is the initial step in what could be an important program enabling access to an evidence-based memory intervention for older adults worldwide.","Pike, K. E.; Moller, C.

In this article, we analyse some ethical issues that have had a predominant role in decision making in response to the current COVID-19 pandemic but were absent or not addressed in the same ways in the 2016 guidance document. A pandemic results in a health crisis and social and political crises both nationally and globally. The ethical implications of these global effects should be properly identified so that appropriate actions can be taken globally and not just in national isolation. Our analysis, which is a starting point to test the broader relevance of the 2016 WHO document that remains the only available guidance document applicable globally, concludes that the WHO guidance should be updated to provide reasoned and thoughtful comprehensive ethics advice for the sound management of the current and future pandemics.","Saxena, Abha; Bouvier, Paul André; Shamsi-Gooshki, Ehsan; Köhler, Johannes; Schwartz, Lisa J",J. med. ethics,,101

370919,In-situ at a distance? challenges and opportunities for health and place research methods in a post-COVID-19 world,2021,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: From the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, analysts warned that older populations, due to their age, chronic illnesses, and lack of technological facility, would suffer disproportionately from loneliness as they sheltered in place indefinitely. Several studies have recently been published on the impact of COVID-19-related loneliness among older populations, but little has been written about the experiences of already-lonely older individuals; those that had lived with persistent loneliness before the advent of COVID-19. This qualitative study sought to understand how already lonely older individuals navigated and endured the social isolation of the pandemic. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Twelve semi-structured interviews were conducted with individuals aged 65 or older who scored a 6 or above on the three-item UCLA Loneliness Risk screening tool. Interviews were coded using the constant comparative method. Themes and understandings of loneliness that reoccurred within and across interviews were identified and collected. RESULTS: Already-isolated, older interviewees did not necessarily experience the abject loneliness hypothesized by analysts. Most interviewees used long-standing arrangements, in place to mitigate loneliness and endure social isolation, to manage the social deprivation of COVID-19. As a result, their loneliness did not compound during long bouts of mandated social isolation. To the contrary, loneliness during the pandemic appeared to carry a new valence for interviewees, as COVID-19 imbued their isolation with new meaning, rendering their loneliness necessary and responsible. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Exploring individuals' subjective perceptions of loneliness can help provide a deeper understanding of what it means to be isolated and alone during COVID-19, and aid in designing strategies to mitigate loneliness.","Bundy, Henry; Lee, Heather M; Sturkey, Kim N; Caprio, Anthony J",GerontologistGerontologist,,101
371047,Digital Disenfranchisement and COVID-19: Broadband Internet Access as a Social Determinant of Health,2021,"Objective: To study the role for preoperative CT chest scans in suspected COVID-19 patients requiring emergent surgery. Design: Retrospective - observational. Participants: A total of 98 patients admitted for emergency surgery with COVID-19 infection and underwent preoperative CT chest scanning. Main outcome measurements: Incidence of clinical symptoms of COVID-19 infection upon presentation, imaging characteristics in chest CT and semi-quantitative CT severity score. Results: The median age of the study cohorts was 50 years (interquartile range (IQR): 40-60 years) and 52/98 (53.1%) were males. The most common symptoms were fever (80.6%) and cough (65.3%). 50/98 had positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RT-PCR test prior to CT scan, while 48/98 had positive reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) result returned after imaging. The imaging characteristics were bilateral infiltrates on CT of 90/98, with 70/98 of infiltrates located peripherally and 28/98 located peripherally and centrally. The most common disease pattern was ground-glass opacities, observed in 95/98. The median total COVID-19 CT severity score was 7 (IQR: 4-14), corresponding to 5-25% global lung involvement. Conclusion: Patients with mild symptomatic COVID-19 in this study displayed CT evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Preoperative CT imaging should be considered for identifying suspected active SARS-CoV-2 cases in resource limited environments with high community spread, to aid in resource allocation and personal protective equipment (PPE) rationing.","Abosamak, M.

Herein, we show that arylvinylpyridiniums (AVPs), the most widely studied class of ChAT inhibitors, act as substrate in an unusual coenzyme A-dependent hydrothiolation reaction. This in-situ synthesis yields an adduct that is the actual enzyme inhibitor. The adduct is deeply buried in the active site tunnel of ChAT and interactions with a hydrophobic pocket near the choline binding site have major implications for the molecular recognition of inhibitors. Our findings clarify the inhibition mechanism of AVPs, establish a drug modality that exploits a target-catalysed reaction between exogenous and endogenous precursors, and provide new directions for the development of ChAT inhibitors with improved potency and bioactivity.","Wiktelius, Daniel; Allgardsson, Anders; Bergström, Tomas; Hoster, Norman; Akfur, Christine; Forsgren, Nina; Lejon, Christian; Hedenström, Mattias; Linusson, Anna; Ekström, Fredrik",Angew. chem; int. ed. engl,,101

377924,Virtual Seminar on Coronavirus 2019 for the US-Mexico Border Region: Building Opportunities for Communication and Collaboration,2021,"PURPOSE: The coronavirus pandemic has redefined the practice of head and neck surgeons in the management of oncology patients. Several countries have issued practice recommendations in that context. This review is a collaboration of the YO-IFOS (Young Otolaryngologists of the International Federation of Otolaryngological Societies) group in order to summarize, in a systematic way, all available guidelines and provide clear guidelines for the management of head and neck cancer patients in the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This systematic review was performed according to the PRISMA statements. Inclusion criteria for the systematic review were based on the population, intervention, comparison, and outcomes according to (PICO) framework. The AGREE II (Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II) instrument was used to assess quality of all practice guidelines included in this review. RESULTS: Recommendations include adjustments regarding new patients' referral such as performing a pre-appointment triage and working in telemedicine when possible. Surgical prioritization must be adjusted in order to respect pandemic requirements. High-grade malignancies should, howeve,r not be delayed, due to potential serious consequences. Many head and neck interventions being aerosol-generating procedures, COVID-19 testing prior to a surgery and adequate PPE precautions are essential in operating rooms. CONCLUSION: These recommendations for head and neck oncology patients serve as a guide for physicians in the pandemic. Adjustments and updates are necessary as the pandemic evolves.","Gascon, Laurence; Fournier, Isabelle; Chiesa-Estomba, Carlos; Russo, Gennaro; Fakhry, Nicolas; Lechien, Jérôme R; Burnell, Lisa; Vergez, Sebastien; Metwaly, Osama; Capasso, Pasquale; Ayad, Tareck",Eur. arch. oto-rhino-laryngol,,101

METHODS: Laboratory results and obstetrical outcomes of women with singleton gestations, admitted for delivery during the COVID-19 mask-wearing period (April-June 2020) were compared with those of women delivering during the parallel period in 2019 and with a larger cohort derived from nine pre-pandemic years (March 2011-April 2020). RESULTS: Overall, 1838 women delivered during the COVID-19 pandemic. Compared with the pre-pandemic period, mean hemoglobin and fibrinogen levels were significantly higher during the mask-wearing period (12.15 ± 1.1 vs 11.96 ± 1.2, P < 0.001 and 472 ± 103.6 vs 448 ± 85.1 mg/dl, P < 0.001, respectively). Platelet levels were lower (200 ± 56.0 vs 206 ± 57.5 K/µl, P < 0.001). The rate of delivery at <34 weeks of gestation was lower during the mask-wearing period (1.1% vs 2%, odds ratio [OR] 0.57, 95% confidence intervals [CI] 0.37-0.88, P = 0.01), whereas cesarean delivery and postpartum hemorrhage rates were higher (26.7% vs 24.4%, OR 1.13, 95% CI 1.02-1.25, P = 0.022 and 4.1% vs 2.8%, OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.2-1.8, P = 0.001, respectively). CONCLUSION: A hard-to-ventilate space created by wearing a mask during the COVID-19 era may be the underlying cause of the observed higher hemoglobin level among pregnant women, possibly affecting obstetrical outcomes.","Friedrich, Lior; Levin, Gabriel; Maixner, Nitzan; Bart, Yossi; Tsur, Abraham; Yinon, Yoav; Meyer, Raanan",Int. j. gynaecol. obstet,,101

Although the origin of the associated virus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]) remains unclear, genetic evidence suggests that bats are a reservoir host of the virus, and pangolins are a probable intermediate. SARS-CoV-2 has crossed the species barrier to infect humans and other animal species, and infected humans can facilitate reverse-zoonotic transmission to animals. Considering the rapidly changing interconnections among people, animals, and ecosystems, traditional roles of veterinarians should evolve to include transdisciplinary roles.","Yoo, Han Sang; Yoo, Dongwan",J Vet Sci,,101

This contribution explores connections between the COVID-19pandemic, chronic disease and conditions of chronic crisis among the urban poor. We suggest two issues in urgent need of attention in the long and short term are: 1) the underestimatedburdens of chronic disease among the urban poor, and 2) the chronic states of crises which contribute to these chronic conditions and their under-recognition. We contend that the burden of ‘pre-existing’ conditions in informal settlements is under-diagnosed and poorly managed in communities. In order to address these burdens, for COVID-19 and beyond, we must recognise they are a product of the protracted crisis which is everyday life for many of the urban poor, for whom illness is one of the many everyday struggles and consistent quality care is out of reach. For many people living on the margins, crisis is the norm, yet both this and its impacts on health are underestimated; for change to be realised, this must be the starting point.","Wilkinson, Annie; Conteh, Abu; Macarthy, Joseph",Cities Health,,101

DESIGN: Matched cohort (pairwise method). SETTING: A single tertiary neurosurgical referral centre at a large UK Major Trauma Centre. PARTICIPANTS: During the first COVID-19 wave, 231 neurosurgical cases were performed. These cases were matched to cases from 2019. Cases were matched for age (±10 years), primary pathology and surgical procedure. Cases were excluded from analysis if either the age could not be matched to within 10 years, or the primary pathology or procedure was too unique. After exclusions, 191 cases were included in final analysis. OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcomes were 30-day mortality and postoperative pulmonary complications. Secondary outcomes included Glasgow Outcome Score (GOS) on discharge, length of stay (LoS), operative and anaesthetic times and grade of primary surgeon. An exploratory outcome was the SARS-CoV-2 status of patients. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the pandemic and matched cohorts in 30-day mortality, pulmonary complications, discharge GOS, LoS, operative or anaesthetic times. There was a significant difference in the variation of grade of primary surgeon. Only 2.2% (n=5) of patients had a SARS-CoV-2 positive swab. CONCLUSION: During the first UK wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, the mortality, morbidity and functional outcomes of operatively managed neurosurgical patients at University Hospitals Birmingham were not significantly affected compared with normal practice. The grade of primary surgeon was significantly more senior and adds to the growing body of evidence that demonstrates how the pandemic has negatively impacted UK surgical training. Mixing COVID-19 positive, unknown and negative cases did not significantly impact on outcomes and indicates that further research is required to support the implementation of evidence-based surgical pathways, such as COVID-light sites, throughout the next stage of the pandemic.","Toman, Emma; Soon, Wai Cheong; Thanabalasundaram, Gopiga; Burns, Daniel; Petrik, Vladimir; Watts, Colin; Wykes, Victoria; White, Anwen",BMJ Open,,101
380894,Understanding the Whole of Military Health Systems,2020,"In the current global emergency due to SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, passive immunotherapy emerges as a promising treatment for COVID-19. Among animal-derived products, equine formulations are still the cornerstone therapy for treating envenomations due to animal bites and stings. Therefore, drawing upon decades of experience in manufacturing snake antivenom, we developed and preclinically evaluated two anti-SARS-CoV-2 polyclonal equine formulations as potential alternative therapy for COVID-19. We immunized two groups of horses with either S1 (anti-S1) or a mixture of S1, N, and SEM mosaic (anti-Mix) viral recombinant proteins. Horses reached a maximum anti-viral antibody level at 7 weeks following priming, and showed no major adverse acute or chronic clinical alterations. Two whole-IgG formulations were prepared via hyperimmune plasma precipitation with caprylic acid and then formulated for parenteral use. Both preparations had similar physicochemical and microbiological quality and showed ELISA immunoreactivity towards S1 protein and the receptor binding domain (RBD). The anti-Mix formulation also presented immunoreactivity against N protein. Due to high anti-S1 and anti-RBD antibody content, final products exhibited high in vitro neutralizing capacity of SARS-CoV-2 infection, 80 times higher than a pool of human convalescent plasma. Pre-clinical quality profiles were similar among both products, but clinical efficacy and safety must be tested in clinical trials. The technological strategy we describe here can be adapted by other producers, particularly in low- and middle-income countries.","León, Guillermo; Herrera, María; Vargas, Mariángela; Arguedas, Mauricio; Sánchez, Andrés; Segura, Álvaro; Gómez, Aarón; Solano, Gabriela; Corrales-Aguilar, Eugenia; Risner, Kenneth; Narayanan, Aarthi; Bailey, Charles; Villalta, Mauren; Hernández, Andrés; Sánchez, Adriana; Cordero, Daniel; Solano, Daniela; Durán, Gina; Segura, Eduardo; Cerdas, Maykel; Umaña, Deibid; Moscoso, Edwin; Estrada, Ricardo; Gutiérrez, Jairo; Méndez, Marcos; Castillo, Ana Cecilia; Sánchez, Laura; Sánchez, Ronald; Gutiérrez, José María; Díaz, Cecilia; Alape, Alberto",Sci Rep,,101

COVIPREG is a prospective French multicenter study to assess the seroprevalence at the time of delivery and the maternal and neonatal impact of COVID-19 infection during pregnancy. In order to study factors associated with poor outcomes after COVID-19 Infection during pregnancy and adapt the sample size of the study, a preliminary assessment of the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG was planned after 500 inclusions in a one perinatal center of Paris area. OBJECTIVES: To assess the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody response in pregnant women at the time of delivery during the COVID-19 pandemia. STUDY DESIGN: A prospective observational study at Cochin hospital (Level III maternity). Patients admitted for delivery were offered to participate to the study. Each patient participating to the study was tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2-IgG antibodies using a commercially available ELISA. RESULTS: Among the 529 patients included in the COVIPREG study between April 29 and June 26, 529 were assessed for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody response and 25 had a positive test, ie 4.7 % with a confidence interval at 95 % [3.0 %-6.9 %]). CONCLUSIONS: Four months after the beginning of the infection in Paris, the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG in pregnant women at the time of delivery is low.

This study aims to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the detection and management of colorectal cancer in England. METHODS: Data were extracted from four population-based datasets spanning NHS England (the National Cancer Cancer Waiting Time Monitoring, Monthly Diagnostic, Secondary Uses Service Admitted Patient Care and the National Radiotherapy datasets) for all referrals, colonoscopies, surgical procedures, and courses of rectal radiotherapy from Jan 1, 2019, to Oct 31, 2020, related to colorectal cancer in England. Differences in patterns of care were investigated between 2019 and 2020. Percentage reductions in monthly numbers and proportions were calculated. FINDINGS: As compared to the monthly average in 2019, in April, 2020, there was a 63% (95% CI 53-71) reduction (from 36â274 to 13â440) in the monthly number of 2-week referrals for suspected cancer and a 92% (95% CI 89-95) reduction in the number of colonoscopies (from 46â441 to 3484). Numbers had just recovered by October, 2020. This resulted in a 22% (95% CI 8-34) relative reduction in the number of cases referred for treatment (from a monthly average of 2781 in 2019 to 2158 referrals in April, 2020). By October, 2020, the monthly rate had returned to 2019 levels but did not exceed it, suggesting that, from April to October, 2020, over 3500 fewer people had been diagnosed and treated for colorectal cancer in England than would have been expected. There was also a 31% (95% CI 19-42) relative reduction in the numbers receiving surgery in April, 2020, and a lower proportion of laparoscopic and a greater proportion of stoma-forming procedures, relative to the monthly average in 2019. By October, 2020, laparoscopic surgery and stoma rates were similar to 2019 levels. For rectal cancer, there was a 44% (95% CI 17-76) relative increase in the use of neoadjuvant radiotherapy in April, 2020, relative to the monthly average in 2019, due to greater use of short-course regimens. Although in June, 2020, there was a drop in the use of short-course regimens, rates remained above 2019 levels until October, 2020. INTERPRETATION: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a sustained reduction in the number of people referred, diagnosed, and treated for colorectal cancer. By October, 2020, achievement of care pathway targets had returned to 2019 levels, albeit with smaller volumes of patients and with modifications to usual practice. As pressure grows in the NHS due to the second wave of COVID-19, urgent action is needed to address the growing burden of undetected and untreated colorectal cancer in England.

386279,Can the Covid19 pandemic affect the achievement of the 'Zero Hunger' goal? Some preliminary reflections,2021,"At the end of 2019, the outbreak of COVID-19 was reported in Wuhan, China. The outbreak spread quickly to several countries, becoming a public health emergency of international interest. Without a vaccine or antiviral drugs, control measures are necessary to understand the evolution of cases. Here, we report through spatial analysis the spatial pattern of the COVID-19 outbreak. The study site was the State of São Paulo, Brazil, where the first case of the disease was confirmed. We applied the Kernel Density to generate surfaces that indicate where there is higher density of cases and, consequently, greater risk of confirming new cases. The spatial pattern of COVID-19 pandemic could be observed in São Paulo State, in which its metropolitan region standed out with the greatest cases, being classified as a hotspot. In addition, the main highways and airports that connect the capital to the cities with the highest population density were classified as medium density areas by the Kernel Density method.It indicates a gradual expansion from the capital to the interior. Therefore, spatial analyses are fundamental to understand the spread of the virus and its association with other spatial data can be essential to guide control measures.","Rex, Franciel Eduardo; Borges, Cléber Augusto de Souza; Käfer, Pâmela Suélen",Cien Saude Colet,,101

A total of 600 tweets were assessed (N = 600) for sentiment, risks presented, attribution of blame, and outrage. A sample of 300 tweets was taken from Sunday, February 9, through Wednesday, February 19, 2020, and an additional 300 tweets from Sunday, March 1, through Wednesday, March 11, 2020, to assess how public communication changed over time. Results show that risk, blame, and outrage differed significantly between February and March in a variety of ways. Specifically, more significant risks were noted in February than in March, with the majority of March tweets not noting any specific risks. Although most tweets did not present any specific blame, more blame was presented in February than in March, although more tweets in March attributed blame to countries and governments. Finally, outrage varied in several ways, with hazards generally being higher in February and outrage being higher in March.","Damiano, Amanda D; Allen Catellier, Jennifer R",Cyberpsychology behav. soc. netw.

394730,Analysis of epidemiological surveillance activity of the COVID-19 at Surabaya Airport Indonesia on January 2020. (Special issue: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and responses.),2020,"Sepsis remains the leading cause of mortality in hospitalized patients, contributing to 1 in every 2-3 deaths. From a pathophysiological view, in the recent definition, sepsis has been defined as the result of a complex interaction between host response and the infecting organism, resulting in life-threatening organ dysfunction, depending on microcirculatory derangement, cellular hypoxia/dysoxia driven by hypotension and, potentially, death. The high energy expenditure driven by a high metabolic state induced by the host response may rapidly lead to micronutrient depletion. This deficiency can result in alterations in normal energy homeostasis, free radical damage, and immune system derangement. In critically ill patients, micronutrients are still relegated to an ancillary role in the whole treatment, and always put in a second-line place or, frequently, neglected. Only some micronutrients have attracted the attention of a wider audience, and some trials, even large ones, have tested their use, with controversial results. The present review will address this topic, including the recent advancement in the study of vitamin D and protocols based on vitamin C and other micronutrients, to explore an update in the setting of sepsis, gain some new insights applicable to COVID-19 patients, and to contribute to a pathophysiological definition of the potential role of micronutrients that will be helpful in future dedicated trials.","Rossetti, Matteo; Martucci, Gennaro; Starchl, Christina; Amrein, Karin",Medicina (Kaunas),,101

This study aimed to analyze the characteristics of asymptomatic carriers with COVID-19 to control the spread of the virus. We retrospectively investigated the clinical characteristics of 648 consecutive subjects who were enrolled in the study and were divided into asymptomatic carriers, mild cases, ordinary cases, severe or critical cases, and evaluated their impact on disease severity by means of Spearman correlation and multiple regression analyses. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was conducted to determine the optimum cutoff levels of laboratory findings for diagnostic predictors of asymptomatic carriers of COVID-19. In our study, a total of 648 subjects on admission with a mean age of 45.61 y including 345 males and 303 females were enrolled in our study. The leukocyte, lymphocyte, eosinophil, platelet, C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, CD3+, CD4+, and CD8 + T lymphocyte levels, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate differed significantly among the groups (all p &#8804; 0.05). Disease severity was negatively associated with the CD3+ (r = -0.340; p < 0.001), CD4+ (r = -0.290; p = 0.001) and CD8+ (r = -0.322; p < 0.001) T lymphocyte levels. The significant diagnostic predictors of asymptomatic carriers of COVID-19 included the blood cell, cytokine, and T lymphocyte subset levels. Inflammation and immune response may play important roles in disease progression. Hence, the laboratory parameters identified should be considered in clinical practice, which provide new insights into the identification of asymptomatic individuals and the prevention of virus transmission.","Chen, Jiaxin; Han, Tao; Huang, Mao; Yang, Yi; Shang, Futai; Zheng, Yishan; Zhao, Wenjing; Luo, Liang; Han, Xudong; Lin, Aihua; Zhao, Hongsheng; Gu, Qin; Shi, Yi; Li, Jun; Xu, Xingxiang; Liu, Kexi; Deng, Yijun; Jia, Enzhi; Cao, Quan",Virulence,,101

While crucial to control the pandemic, isolation might have a significant impact on productivity and mental health. Especially for researchers working in healthcare, the current situation is complex. We therefore carried out a survey amongst researchers in the field of radiation oncology to gain insights on the impact of social isolation and working from home and to guide future work. Materials and methods: An online survey was conducted between March 27th and April 5th, 2020. The first part contained 14 questions intended to capture an overview of the specific aspects related to research while in isolation. The second (optional) part of the questionnaire was the validated Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), a self-reported measure used to assess levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms. Results: From 543 survey participants, 48.8% reported to work full-time from home. The impact on perceived productivity, with 71.2% of participants feeling less productive, caused 58% of participants to feel some level of guilt. Compared to normative data, relatively high levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms were recorded for the 335 participants who filled out the HADS questionnaire. Group comparisons found the presence of a supportive institutional program as the sole factor of statistical significance in both anxiety and depressive symptom levels. People having to work full-time on location showed higher depressive symptom levels than those working from home. Anxiety scores were negatively correlated with the number of research years. Conclusion: Results of the survey showed there is a non-negligible impact on both productivity and mental health. As the radiation oncology research community was forced to work from home during the COVID-19 pandemic, lessons can be learned to face future adverse situations but also to improve work-life balance in general.","Dhont, Jennifer; Di Tella, Marialaura; Dubois, Ludwig; Aznar, Marianne; Petit, Steven; Spałek, Mateusz; Boldrini, Luca; Franco, Pierfrancesco; Bertholet, Jenny",Clin.

Accordingly previous studies reported altered lymphocyte frequency, cytokine level and microbial composition in PFAPA tonsils. The aim of our study is to monitor expression levels of pro-inflammatory cell surface Toll-like receptors (TLRs) which have important role in induction of inflammation and maintaining tissue haemostasis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seven patients with PFAPA syndrome, and eight patients with group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal (GAßHS) recurrent tonsillitis were included in our study. Tonsillar expression levels of TLR-1, -2, -4, -5, and -6 were monitored by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Expression levels were scored using semi-quantitative analysis method and were statistically analyzed by Two-Way Repeated Measures Analysis of Variance test. RESULTS: IHC analysis demonstrated expression of all TLRs in tonsillar surface epithelium (SE) and lymphoid interior (LI) except for TLR-6 which was not present in the former. There has not been any statistically significant difference in TLR expression levels between PFAPA and GAßHS tonsils, except for TLR-1 and TLR-2 which were higher on LI and lower on SE of PFAPA tonsils, respectively, than that of the GAßHS samples. CONCLUSIONS: Altered TLR expression levels may be involved in PFAPA pathogenesis. Future studies with higher patient number, uninflamed tonsils and cellular markers are required to further enlighten the role of TLRs in the development of syndrome.","Gazi, Umut; Ozkayalar, Hanife; Mujahed, Monjed I M; Tosun, Ozgur; Dalkan, Ceyhun; Sanlidag, Burcin; Asim Safak, Mustafa; Mocan, Gamze; Onder Bahceciler, Nerin",Int J Pediatr Otorhinolaryngol,,101

We show that even under moderately heavy patient load (>500 countrywide hospitalized severely-ill patients; the Israeli Ministry of Health defined 800 severely-ill patients as the maximum capacity allowing adequate treatment), in-hospital mortality rate of patients with COVID-19 significantly increased compared to periods of lower patient load (250-500 severely-ill patients): 14-day mortality rates were 22.1% (Standard Error 3.1%) higher (mid-September to mid-October) and 27.2% (Standard Error 3.3%) higher (mid-December to mid-January). We further show this higher mortality rate cannot be attributed to changes in the patient population during periods of heavier load.","Rossman, Hagai; Meir, Tomer; Somer, Jonathan; Shilo, Smadar; Gutman, Rom; Ben Arie, Asaf; Segal, Eran; Shalit, Uri; Gorfine, Malka",Nat Commun,,101
405862,Triage and resource allocation during crisis medical surge conditions (pandemics and mass casualty situations): A position statement of the Christian Medical and Dental Associations special task force,2020,"The pandemic caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus is challenging health systems worldwide in different ways. The main focus is on the acute care of people suffering from COVID-19. One way to maintain these essential health services in the field of dermatology and at the same time to contribute to a reduction of the risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2 by “social distancing” could be offered by telemedical services [1]. Telemedicine (e-health) is the use of telecommunication technologies for the exchange of medical information for diagnosis, consultation, therapy and teaching. Dermatology is particularly suitable for telemedical diagnosis and consultation due to its image-based orientation in diagnostics. Two technologies are predominantly used in dermatological telemedicine (teledermatology): Store- -and-Forward (SAF) technology, in which clinical images and additional information are evaluated spatially dispersed with a time delay (asynchronous procedure), and video conferencing, in which dermatological image-based diagnosis and consultation take place synchronously [1]. A teledermatological consultation can be carried out directly for patients, but also in an intra-medical dialogue for physicians of other disciplines (teleconsultation). Besides pure medical aspects, teledermatological practices entail a number of specific legal problems that are especially crucial and relevant in times of the COVID-19 outbreak [2]. Such issues as data privacy, confidentiality and patients' autonomy during teledermatological consultations are of a crucial importance both on the EU and US legislation [2, 3]. One might outline the problems of a general under development of the legal basis concerning teledermatological treatment and a lack of a special regulation of the topic at the EU level [2, 3]. Dermatologists in hospitals and practices were able to compensate at least partially for the restrictions of personal dermatological care of patients with skin diseases under the conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic by an extension of teledermatological services (video consultation, SAF teledermatology). Findings from the use of teledermatology during the pandemic should be used to further improve the use of teledermatology, for which the structural framework conditions in the health care system must be created. The use of teledermatological instruments during the COVID-19 pandemic has pointed out the need to develop and concretize the legal basis in the mentioned field.","Adaskevich, U. P.; Adaskevich, S.

Though patient characteristics associated with developing long COVID are partially known, those associated with persisting it have not been identified. MethodsWe conducted a cross-sectional questionnaire survey of patients after COVID-19 recovery who visited the National Center for Global Health and Medicine between February 2020 and March 2021. Demographic and clinical data, and the presence and duration of long COVID were obtained. We identified factors associated with development and persistence of long COVID using multivariate logistic and linear regression analysis, respectively. ResultsWe analyzed 457 of 526 responses (response rate, 86.9%). The median age was 47 years, and 378 patients (84.4%) had mild disease in acute phase. The number of patients with any symptoms after 6 and 12 months after onset or diagnosis were 120 (26.3%) and 40 (8.8%), respectively. Women were at risk for development of fatigue (OR 2.03, 95% CI 1.31-3.14), dysosmia (OR 1.91, 95% CI 1.24-2.93), dysgeusia (OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.02-2.39), and hair loss (OR 3.00, 95% CI 1.77-5.09), and were at risk for persistence of any symptoms (coefficient 38.0, 95% CI 13.3-62.8). Younger age and low body mass index were risk factors for developing dysosmia (OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.94-0.98, and OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.89-0.99, respectively) and dysgeusia (OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.96-1.00, and OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.88-0.98, respectively). ConclusionWe identified risk factors for the persistence as well as development of long COVID. Many patients suffer from long-term residual symptoms, even in mild cases. SummaryOur cross-sectional questionnaire survey of patients recovering from COVID-19 revealed that women, young age, and low body mass index were risk factors for the development of multiple symptoms, and that even mild cases of COVID-19 suffered from long-term residual symptoms.","Miyazato, Yusuke; Tsuzuki, Shinya; Morioka, Shinichiro; Terada, Mari; Kutsuna, Satoshi; Saito, Sho; Shimanishi, Yumiko; Takahashi, Kozue; Sanada, Mio; Akashi, Masako; Kuge, Chika; Osanai, Yasuyo; Tanaka, Keiko; Suzuki, Michiyo; Hayakawa, Kayoko; Ohmagari, Norio",,,101
406262,Occupational Health Surveillance as a Tool for COVID-19 Prevention,2021,"There are regular reports of extrapulmonary infections and manifestations related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Coronaviruses are potentially neurotropic, which renders neuronal tissue vulnerable to infection, especially in elderly individuals or in those with neuro-comorbid conditions. Complaints of ageusia, anosmia, myalgia, and headache; reports of diseases such as stroke, encephalopathy, seizure, and encephalitis; and loss of consciousness in patients with COVID-19 confirm the neuropathophysiological aspect of this disease. The brain is linked to pulmonary organs, physiologically through blood circulation, and functionally through the nervous system. The interdependence of these vital organs may further aggravate the pathophysiological aspects of COVID-19. The induction of a cytokine storm in systemic circulation can trigger a neuroinflammatory cascade, which can subsequently compromise the blood-brain barrier and activate microglia- and astrocyte-borne Toll-like receptors, thereby leading to neuronal tissue damage. Hence, a holistic approach should be adopted by healthcare professionals while treating COVID-19 patients with a history of neurodegenerative disorders, neuropsychological complications, or any other neuro-compromised conditions. Imperatively, vaccines are being developed at top priority to contain the spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, and different vaccines are at different stages of development globally.

Businesses, social and religious gatherings, travel, and almost all forms of transportation shut down to halt the spread of COVID-19. People were ordered to quarantine in place, and the world appears to go into a standstill. In the midst of being quarantined people with acute and chronic conditions still require medical care and treatment. An alternative way for people to receive needed health care was necessary. Hence, we saw an unprecedented surge in telehealth. With this unprecedented surge in use of telehealth, there is matter of delivering quality care. Objective: Guided by the Donabedian Model, the purpose of this integrative review was to examine current evidence on patient and healthcare provider's satisfaction with the use of telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design: An integrative review of the literature. Data sources: The literature review was conducted utilizing PubMED, CINAHL, Google Scholar and Cochrane Library databases. Inclusion criteria were studies published from January 2020 to July 11, 2020, published and translated in English language, and studies that evaluated patients and providers satisfaction with the use of telehealth or telemedicine during COVID-19. Eighteen articles were included in this review. Review methods: An evaluation matrix was developed to collect data from the included articles. The articles were appraised using Fineout-Overholt & Gallagher-Ford Rapid Critical Appraisal Checklist for Descriptive Studies and Rapid Critical Appraisal of Evidence-Based Practice Implementation or Quality Improvement Projects (Melnyk & Fineout-Overholt, 2015). Authors independently appraised each article using the appropriate appraisal tools. Results: Ten of the articles (53%) included were studies conducted in the United States. Sixteen out of 18 studies evaluated patient satisfaction and five studies examined healthcare providers' satisfaction with the use of telehealth. The majority of telehealth services offered were by subspecialists. Overall, patients and healthcare providers have high level of satisfaction with the use of telehealth during COVID-19 pandemic. Many patients and healthcare providers reported willingness to continue using telehealth after the pandemic. Conclusion: This integrative review provided additional evidence on patient and healthcare provider's satisfaction with the use of telehealth. Findings in this review may not be surprising as individuals, healthcare providers, and health systems needed to adopt the use telehealth due to necessity. However, the results for telehealth are promising.","Andrews, Elizabeth; Berghofer, Kendall; Long, Julie; Prescott, Amber; Caboral-Stevens, Meriam",Int J Nurs Stud Adv,,101

In this study, we aimed to evaluate the viral load measurement using reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP), which is a simpler procedure compared to RT-qPCR. MATERIALS AND METHODS: RNA was extracted by using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit. The RT-LAMP assay was performed by using the Loopamp® 2019-SARS-CoV-2 detection reagent kit and 10-fold serial dilutions of known viral load RT-LAMP were used to measure Tt, which is the time until the turbidity exceeds the threshold. Based on the relationship between viral load and Tt, the linearity and detection sensitivity of the calibration curve were evaluated. In addition, 117 clinical specimens were measured, and RT-qPCR and RT-LAMP assay results were compared. RESULTS: The dilution linearity of the calibration curve was maintained at five orders of magnitude 1.0× 106 to 1.0 × 101 copies/µL, and was confirmed to be detectable down to 1.0 × 100 copies/µL. The limit of quantification of RNA extracted from clinical specimens using RT-LAMP correlated well with that obtained using RT-qPCR (r2 = 0.930). CONCLUSION: The findings indicate that RT-LAMP is an effective method to determine the viral load of SARS-CoV-2.","Minami, Kenta; Masutani, Ryota; Suzuki, Youichi; Kubota, Meri; Osaka, Naofumi; Nakanishi, Toyofumi; Nakano, Takashi; Ukimura, Akira",J Infect Chemother,,101

413314,Can transdisciplinary approaches contribute to the COVID-19 fight?,2021,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has swept all over the world. Due to the limited detection facilities, especially in developing countries, a large number of suspected cases can only receive common clinical diagnosis rather than more effective detections like Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) tests or CT scans. This motivates us to develop a quick screening method via common clinical diagnosis results. However, the diagnostic items of different patients may vary greatly, and there is a huge variation in the dimension of the diagnosis data among different suspected patients, it is hard to process these indefinite dimension data via classical classification algorithms. To resolve this problem, we propose an Indefiniteness Elimination Network (IE-Net) to eliminate the influence of the varied dimensions and make predictions about the COVID-19 cases. The IE-Net is in an encoder-decoder framework fashion, and an indefiniteness elimination operation is proposed to transfer the indefinite dimension feature into a fixed dimension feature. Comprehensive experiments were conducted on the public available COVID-19 Clinical Spectrum dataset. Experimental results show that the proposed indefiniteness elimination operation greatly improves the classification performance, the IE-Net achieves 94.80% accuracy, 92.79% recall, 92.97% precision and 94.93% AUC for distinguishing COVID-19 cases from non-COVID-19 cases with only common clinical diagnose data. We further compared our methods with 3 classical classification algorithms: random forest, gradient boosting and multi-layer perceptron (MLP). To explore each clinical test item's specificity, we further analyzed the possible relationship between each clinical test item and COVID-19.","Guo, Guangyu; Liu, Zhuoyan; Zhao, Shijie; Guo, Lei; Liu, Tianming",IEEE J Biomed Health Inform,,101
414498,Physical health checks for people with severe mental illness during COVID-19,2021,"Adaptive leadership has become an essential skill for leaders in health systems to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic as new knowledge emerges and case counts rise, fall, and rise again. This leadership approach has been described as an iterative process of taking a wide view of the situation, interpreting the meaning of incoming data from multiple directions, and taking real-time action. This process is also common in start-ups, which attempt to create new products or services of uncertain value for consumer markets that may not yet exist. Start-ups manage uncertainty through ""pivots,"" which can include changes in the target group, need, features, or intended benefit of a product or service. Pivots are large changes that account for the high likelihood of getting something wrong during development, and they are distinct from the ""tweaks"" or small tests of change that define quality improvement methodology. This case study describes three pivots in the launch of a remote monitoring program for COVID-19. Adaptive leadership helped inform strategic decisions, with pivots providing a framework for internal and external stakeholders to articulate options for changes to address shifting needs. There is considerable uncertainty in the appropriate design and implementation of health services, and although this case example focuses on the use of adaptive leadership and pivots during a pandemic, these strategies are relevant for health care leaders at any time.","Laur, Celia Violet; Agarwal, Payal; Mukerji, Geetha; Goulbourne, Elaine; Baranek, Hayley; Pus, Laura; Bhatia, R Sacha; Martin, Danielle; Bhattacharyya, Onil",J Med Internet Res,,101

METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Google Scholar, and medRxiv (preprint repository) databases (up to 7 January 2021). Pooled effect sizes with 95% confidence interval (CI) were generated using random-effects and inverse variance heterogeneity models. The risk of bias of the included RCTs was appraised using version 2 of the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials. RESULTS: Six RCTs were included: two trials with an overall low risk of bias and four trials had some concerns regarding the overall risk of bias. Our meta-analysis did not find significant mortality benefits with the use of tocilizumab among patients with COVID-19 relative to non-use of tocilizumab (pooled hazard ratio = 0.83; 95% CI 0.66-1.05, n = 2,057). Interestingly, the estimated effect of tocilizumab on the composite endpoint of requirement for mechanical ventilation and/or all-cause mortality indicated clinical benefits, with some evidence against our model hypothesis of no significant effect at the current sample size (pooled hazard ratio = 0.62; 95% CI 0.42-0.91, n = 749). CONCLUSION: Despite no clear mortality benefits in hospitalized patients with COVID-19, tocilizumab appears to reduce the likelihood of progression to mechanical ventilation.","Kow, Chia Siang; Hasan, Syed Shahzad",Eur. j. clin. pharmacol,,101

Telemedicine services can be considered for management of patients with hematological diseases. This study included all patients who enrolled for telemedicine facility for hematology from May 15 to July 15, 2020. Patient's demographic and disease related parameters were recorded during the teleconsultation call. Overall satisfaction of attending doctor and patients were also recorded. A total of 1187 teleconsultation appointments were taken, of which 944 (79.6%) were successfully attended. Median age of patients was 38 years (range- 0.5-78 years), with 38% females. 55% of successful calls were from patients suffering a malignant hematological disorder. 24% had an active complaint pertaining to their disease or treatment. Of these, 162 (17%) were asked for a physical consultation. A significant association was found between the requirement of physical consultation and diagnosis (p < 0.001), absence of active complaint (< 0.0001) and education level of responder (p = 0.008). Patients understand that teleconsultation is helpful in preventing COVID-19 infection (71.4%) and avoids outpatient department rush (14.5%) associated with physical appointments; and around 80% patients were satisfied with the teleconsult. With the emergence of COVID 19, many localities under partial lockdown with constant fear of contacting virus amongst patients and health care providers, we can clearly see the advantages as well as feasibility of telemedicine services for our patients. The acute surge in telemedicine could be harnessed in the future to provide comprehensive and integrated care to patients of hematological disorders.","Kumar, Pradeep; Aggarwal, Mukul; Dhawan, Rishi; Dass, Jasmita; Kumar, Ganesh; Sharma, Vishnu; Mirza, Saleem; Senapati, Jayastu; Ganju, Neha; Vaid, Tejasvini; Vijayran, Mona; Panda, Tribikram; Pragna, G Stitha; Krishna, Sahitya Sri; Khandelwal, Akash; Verghese, Renjith; Tyagi, Seema; Seth, Tulika; Mahapatra, Manoranjan",Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus,,101

The goal of this study was to test how confinement affected to self-regulation of motivation (SRM);(2) Methods: a longitudinal design was used to obtain information from 75 university students in three moments: before confinement, 20 days after confinement, and 40 days after confinement. The SRM Strategies Questionnaire and the Pittsburgh Sleep Index were used to evaluate the study variables;(3) Results: the SRM decreased as confinement progressed. Moreover, those students who had higher levels of SRM before confinement, showed worse sleep quality 20 days after. There was no interaction effect between moments and gender and between moments and work situation on any of the dimensions of the SRM. There were gender differences (women scored higher) in almost all of the SRM dimensions in the three moments, but there were no differences dependent on the work situation (i.e., only study or study and work);(4) Conclusions: the change from face-to-face classes to virtual learning decreased the SRM of university students and was related to worse sleep quality.

We report on the development and implementation of an internet-based COVID-19 participatory surveillance tool in rural Appalachia. METHODS: A regional collaboration among public health partners culminated in the design and implementation of the COVID-19 Self-Checker, a local online symptom tracker. The tool collected data on participant demographic characteristics and health history. County residents were then invited to take part in an automated daily electronic follow-up to monitor symptom progression, assess barriers to care and testing, and collect data on COVID-19 test results and symptom resolution. RESULTS: Nearly 6500 county residents visited and 1755 residents completed the COVID-19 Self-Checker from April 30 through June 9, 2020. Of the 579 residents who reported severe or mild COVID-19 symptoms, COVID-19 symptoms were primarily reported among women (n = 408, 70.5%), adults with preexisting health conditions (n = 246, 70.5%), adults aged 18-44 (n = 301, 52.0%), and users who reported not having a health care provider (n = 131, 22.6%). Initial findings showed underrepresentation of some racial/ethnic and non-English-speaking groups. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: This low-cost internet-based platform provided a flexible means to collect participatory surveillance data on local changes in COVID-19 symptoms and adapt to guidance. Data from this tool can be used to monitor the efficacy of public health response measures at the local level in rural Appalachia.","Runkle, Jennifer D; Sugg, Maggie M; Graham, Garrett; Hodge, Bryan; March, Terri; Mullendore, Jennifer; Tove, Fletcher; Salyers, Martha; Valeika, Steve; Vaughan, Ellis",Public Health Rep,,101

A reflection on fieldwork under quarantine",2020,"Lupus is a systemic autoimmune disease typified by uncontrolled inflammation, disruption of immune tolerance, and intermittent flaring - events triggerable by environmental factors. Preclinical and clinical studies reveal that consumption of the marine &#969;-3 highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFAs) eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) might be used as a precision nutrition intervention to lessen lupus symptoms. The anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving effects of &#969;-3 HUFAs are inextricably linked to their presence in membrane phospholipids. The &#969;-3 HUFA score, calculated as [100 × (&#969;-3 HUFAs/(&#969;-3 HUFAs + &#969;-6 HUFAs))] in red blood cells (RBCs), and the Omega-3 Index (O3I), calculated as [100 × ((DHA+EPA)/total fatty acids)] in RBCs, are two biomarkers potentially amenable to relating tissue HUFA balance to clinical outcomes in individuals with lupus. Using data from three prior preclinical DHA supplementation studies, we tested the hypothesis that the &#969;-3 HUFA score and the O3I inversely correlate with indicators of autoimmune pathogenesis in the cSiO2-triggered lupus flaring model. The three studies employed both low and high fat rodent diets, as well as more complex diets emulating the U.S. dietary pattern. The &#969;-3 HUFA scores in RBCs were comparatively more robust than the O3I at predicting HUFA balances in the kidney, liver, spleen, and lung. Importantly, increases in both the &#969;-3 HUFA score (>40%) and the O3I (>10%) were strongly associated with suppression of cSiO2-triggered (1) expression of interferon-regulated genes, proinflammatory cytokine production, leukocyte infiltration, and ectopic lymphoid structure development in the lung, (2) pulmonary and systemic autoantibody production, and (3) glomerulonephritis. Collectively, these findings identify achievable &#969;-3 HUFA scores and O3I thresholds that could be targeted in future human intervention studies querying how &#969;-3 HUFA consumption influences lupus and other autoimmune diseases.","Wierenga, Kathryn A; Strakovsky, Rita S; Benninghoff, Abby D; Rajasinghe, Lichchavi D; Lock, Adam L; Harkema, Jack R; Pestka, James J",Front Immunol,,101

Quantitative lesions may provide the radiological evidence of the severity of pneumonia and further to assess the effect of comorbidity on patients with COVID-19. METHODS: 294 patients with COVID-19 were enrolled from February, 24, 2020 to June, 1, 2020 from six centers. Multi-task Unet network was used to segment the whole lung and lesions from chest CT images. This deep learning method was pre-trained in 650 CT images (550 in primary dataset and 100 in test dataset) with COVID-19 or community-acquired pneumonia and Dice coefficients in test dataset were calculated. 50 CT scans of 50 patients (15 with comorbidity and 35 without comorbidity) were random selected to mark lesions manually. The results will be compared with the automatic segmentation model. Eight quantitative parameters were calculated based on the segmentation results to evaluate the effect of comorbidity on patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: Quantitative segmentation model was proved to be effective and accurate with all Dice coefficients more than 0.85 and all accuracies more than 0.95. Of the 294 patients, 52 (17.7%) patients were reported having at least one comorbidity; 14 (4.8%) having more than one comorbidity. Patients with any comorbidity were older (P < 0.001), had longer incubation period (P < 0.001), were more likely to have abnormal laboratory findings (P < 0.05), and be in severity status (P < 0.001). More lesions (including larger volume of lesion, consolidation, and ground-glass opacity) were shown in patients with any comorbidity than patients without comorbidity (all P < 0.001). More lesions were found on CT images in patients with more comorbidities. The median volumes of lesion, consolidation, and ground-glass opacity in diabetes mellitus group were largest among the groups with single comorbidity that had the incidence rate of top three. CONCLUSIONS: Multi-task Unet network can make quantitative CT analysis of lesions to assess the effect of comorbidity on patients with COVID-19, further to provide the radiological evidence of the severity of pneumonia. More lesions (including GGO and consolidation) were found in CT images of cases with comorbidity. The more comorbidities patients have, the more lesions CT images show.","Zhang, Cui; Yang, Guangzhao; Cai, Chunxian; Xu, Zhihua; Wu, Hai; Guo, Youmin; Xie, Zongyu; Shi, Hengfeng; Cheng, Guohua; Wang, Jian",Eur J Med Res,,101

Transmission in social settings was associated with more secondary cases than households when controlling for age (P = 0.002). Decreasing the delay between symptom onset and case confirmation did not result in fewer secondary cases (P = 0.98), although the odds that an individual being quarantined as a contact interrupted transmission was 14.4 (95% CI, 1.9-107.2).

There have been recent calls for more HCS to be conducted in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs), where many relevant diseases are endemic. HCS in general, and HCS in LMICs in particular, raise numerous ethical issues. This paper summarises the findings of a project that explored ethical and regulatory issues related to LMIC HCS via (i) a review of relevant literature and (ii) 45 qualitative interviews with scientists and ethicists. Among other areas of consensus, we found that there was widespread agreement that LMIC HCS can be ethically acceptable, provided that they have a sound scientific rationale, are accepted by local communities and meet usual research ethics requirements. Unresolved issues include those related to (i) acceptable approaches to trade-offs between the scientific aim to produce generalisable results and the protection of participants, (iii) the sharing of benefits with LMIC populations, (iii) the acceptable limits to risks and burdens for participants, (iv) the potential for third-party risk and whether the degree of acceptable third-party risk is different in endemic settings, (v) the conditions under which (if any) it would be appropriate to recruit children for disease-causing HCS, (v) appropriate levels of payment to participants and (vi) appropriate governance of (LMIC) HCS. This paper provides preliminary analyses of these ethical considerations in order to (i) inform scientists and policymakers involved in the planning, conduct and/or governance of LMIC HCS and (ii) highlight areas warranting future research.

We conducted a multicenter retrospective cohort study to determine the incidence of thrombosis in children hospitalized with COVID-19 or MIS-C and to evaluate associated risk factors. We classified patients into one of three groups for analysis: COVID-19, MIS-C, or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2. Among a total of 853 admissions (426 COVID-19, 138 MIS-C, and 289 asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2) in 814 patients, there were 20 patients with thrombotic events (TE) (including 1 stroke).

In patients with COVID-19 or MIS-C, the majority of thrombotic events (89%) occurred in patients &#8805;12 years. Patients > 12 years with MIS-C had the highest rate of thrombosis at 19% (9/48). Notably, 71% of TE that were not present on admission occurred despite thromboprophylaxis. Multivariable analysis identified the following as significantly associated with thrombosis: age &#8805;12 years, cancer, presence of a central venous catheter, and MIS-C. In patients with COVID-19 or MIS-C, hospital mortality was 2.3% (13/564), but was 28% (5/18) in patients with thrombotic events. Our findings may help inform pediatric thromboprophylaxis strategies.","Whitworth, Hilary Baker; Sartain, Sarah E; Kumar, Riten; Armstrong, Katherine; Ballester, Lance; Betensky, Marisol; Cohen, Clay; Diaz, Rosa; Diorio, Caroline; Goldenberg, Neil A; Jaffray, Julie; Keegan, Jacquelyn; Malone, Kendra; Randolph, Adrienne; Rifkin-Zenenberg, Stacey; Leung, Wendy Seto; Sochet, Anthony Alexander; Srivaths, Lakshmi; Zia, Ayesha; Raffini, Leslie",Blood,,101
432255,The children of the missed pill,2021,"BACKGROUND: Awake prone positioning (PP), or proning, is used to avoid intubations in hypoxic patients with COVID-19, but because of the disease's novelty and constant evolution of treatment strategies, the efficacy of awake PP is unclear. We conducted a meta-analysis of the literature to assess the intubation rate among patients with COVID-19 requiring oxygen or noninvasive ventilatory support who underwent awake PP. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, and Scopus databases through August 15, 2020 to identify relevant randomized control trials, observational studies, and case series. We performed random-effects meta-analyses for the primary outcome of intubation rate. We used moderator analysis and meta-regressions to assess sources of heterogeneity. We used the standard and modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scales (NOS) to assess studies' quality. RESULTS: Our search identified 1043 articles. We included 16 studies from the original search and 2 in-press as of October 2020 in our analysis. All were observational studies. Our analysis included 364 patients;mean age was 56.8 (SD 7.12) years, and 68% were men. The intubation rate was 28% (95% CI 20%-38%, I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 63%). The mortality rate among patients who underwent awake PP was 14% (95% CI 7.4%-24.4%). Potential sources of heterogeneity were study design and setting (practice and geographic). CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated an intubation rate of 28% among hypoxic patients with COVID-19 who underwent awake PP. Awake PP in COVID-19 is feasible and practical, and more rigorous research is needed to confirm this promising intervention.","Cardona, S.; Downing, J.; Alfalasi, R.; Bzhilyanskaya, V.; Milzman, D.; Rehan, M.; Schwartz, B.; Yardi, I.; Yazdanpanah, F.; Tran, Q.

432631,Graduate Medical Education Should Not Be A Commodity,2021,"Several epidemiological studies have suggested a link between air pollution and respiratory tract infections. The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) poses a great threat to public health worldwide. However, some parts of the globe have been worse affected in terms of prevalence and deaths than others. The causes and conditions of such variations have yet to be explored. Although some studies indicated a possible correlation between air pollution and COVID-19 severity, there is yet insufficient data for a meaningful answer. This review summarizes the impact of air pollution on COVID-19 infections and severity and discusses the possible management strategies and challenges involved. The available literature investigating the correlation between air pollution and COVID-19 infections and mortality are included in the review. The studies reviewed here suggest that exposure to air pollution, particularly to PM2.5 and NO2 , is positively correlated with COVID-19 infections and mortality. Some data indicate that air pollution can play an important role in the airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2. A high percentage of COVID-19 incidences has been reported in the most polluted areas, where patients needed hospital admission. The available data also show that both short-term and long-term air pollution may enhance COVID-19 severity. However, most of the studies that showed a link between air pollution and COVID-19 infections and mortality did not consider potential confounders during the correlation analysis. Therefore, more specific studies need to be performed focusing on some additional confounders such as individual age, population density, and pre-existing comorbidities to determine the impact of air pollution on COVID-19 infections and deaths.

Second to quantify its bactericidal and fungicidal minimal concentration against S. aureus, S. mutans, and C. albicans found in denture stomatitis. The third purpose is to look at the influence of three different soils (Annaya, Bhanin and Michrif) on the essential oils composition. Three essential oils were extracted by hydro-distillation from three different Origanum Syriacum plant origins. Bioassays were conducted using a broth microdilution methods. Gas Chromatography analysis was used to calculate the abundance of most components in each essential oil. Post hoc tests assessed antimicrobial effects between ecotypes while Pearson's test correlated the different components and their antimicrobial efficiency (&#945; < 0.05). All tested essential oils were efficient against all microorganisms. Origanum Syriacum essential oils derived from Annaya and Bhanin soils showed a superior antimicrobial activity compared to the Michrif one. The most abundant component and most efficient among all essential oils constituents was carvacrol. It can be concluded that Origanum Syriacum essential oils have an antimicrobial activity, which depends on the ecotype, its origin and its composition. They might be used to start a clinical trial for the treatment of denture stomatitis.","Shamseddine, Loubna; Chidiac, Jose Johann",Odontology,,101

The purpose of this case report is to highlight the potential role of intensive care unit recovery or follow-up clinics for patients surviving acute hospitalization for coronavirus disease 2019. CASE PRESENTATION: Our patient was a 27-year-old Caucasian woman with a past medical history of asthma transferred from a community hospital to our medical intensive care unit for acute hypoxic respiratory failure due to bilateral pneumonia requiring mechanical ventilation (ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fraction of inspired oxygen, 180). On day 2 of her intensive care unit admission, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction confirmed coronavirus disease 2019. Her clinical status gradually improved, and she was extubated on intensive care unit day 5. She had a negative test result for coronavirus disease 2019 twice with repeated reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction before being discharged to home after 10 days in the intensive care unit. Two weeks after intensive care unit discharge, the patient returned to our outpatient intensive care unit recovery clinic. At follow-up, the patient endorsed significant fatigue and exhaustion with difficulty walking, minor issues with sleep disruption, and periods of memory loss. She scored 10/12 on the short performance physical battery, indicating good physical function. She did not have signs of anxiety, depression, or post-traumatic stress disorder through self-report questionnaires. Clinically, she was considered at low risk of developing post-intensive care syndrome, but she required follow-up services to assist in navigating the healthcare system, addressing remaining symptoms, and promoting return to her pre-coronavirus disease 2019 societal role. CONCLUSION: We present this case report to suggest that patients surviving coronavirus disease 2019 with subsequent development of acute respiratory distress syndrome will require more intense intensive care unit recovery follow-up. Patients with a higher degree of acute illness who also have pre-existing comorbidities and those of older age who survive mechanical ventilation for coronavirus disease 2019 will require substantial post-intensive care unit care to mitigate and treat post-intensive care syndrome, promote reintegration into the community, and improve quality of life.","Mayer, Kirby P; Sturgill, Jamie L; Kalema, Anna G; Soper, Melissa K; Seif, Sherif M; Cassity, Evan P; Hatton Kolpek, Jimmi; Dupont-Versteegden, Esther E; Montgomery-Yates, Ashley A; Morris, Peter E",J Med Case Rep,,101

In this study, we combined the SIDARTHE model2, which predicts the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections, with a new data-based model that projects new cases onto casualties and healthcare system costs. Based on the Italian case study, we outline several scenarios: mass vaccination campaigns with different paces, different transmission rates due to new variants and different enforced countermeasures, including the alternation of opening and closure phases. Our results demonstrate that non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) have a higher effect on the epidemic evolution than vaccination alone, advocating for the need to keep NPIs in place during the first phase of the vaccination campaign. Our model predicts that, from April 2021 to January 2022, in a scenario with no vaccine rollout and weak NPIs ([Formula: see text] = 1.27), as many as 298,000 deaths associated with COVID-19 could occur. However, fast vaccination rollouts could reduce mortality to as few as 51,000 deaths. Implementation of restrictive NPIs ([Formula: see text] = 0.9) could reduce COVID-19 deaths to 30,000 without vaccinating the population and to 18,000 with a fast rollout of vaccines. We also show that, if intermittent open-close strategies are adopted, implementing a closing phase first could reduce deaths (from 47,000 to 27,000 with slow vaccine rollout) and healthcare system costs, without substantive aggravation of socioeconomic losses.","Giordano, Giulia; Colaneri, Marta; Di Filippo, Alessandro; Blanchini, Franco; Bolzern, Paolo; De Nicolao, Giuseppe; Sacchi, Paolo; Colaneri, Patrizio; Bruno, Raffaele",Nat Med,,101

Using the ground-based observational data, the authors synergistically quantify the nation-wide variations of major air pollutant as well as meteorology during and after the lockdown. Their concentrations (except O-3) exhibited significant reduction during February and March 2020, by more than 24% during the lockdown compared with the earlier time period and by more than 17% compared with that in the same period in 2019. In contrast, ozone increased rapidly by about 60% across the country during the lockdown. Abnormal increases in carbon monoxide and particulate matter concentrations in southwest China are attributed to the severe wildfires in Southeast Asia. The concentration of air pollutants bounced back rapidly after the full-scale reopen in March 2020, indicating the decisive role of emissions in the pollution formation.","Fan, H.; Wang, Y.; Zhao, C.

As the virus spreads in the network, the structure of interactions between people may endogenously change over time, due to quarantining measures and/or spatial-distancing policies. I explore via simulations the dynamic properties of the co-evolutionary process dynamically linking disease diffusion and network properties. Results suggest that, in order to predict how epidemic phenomena evolve in networked populations, it is not enough to focus on the properties of initial interaction structures. Indeed, the co-evolution of network structures and compartment shares strongly shape the process of epidemic diffusion, especially in terms of its speed. Furthermore, I show that the timing and features of spatial-distancing policies may dramatically influence their effectiveness.","Fagiolo, Giorgio",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.11212v1.pdf,101

Publications up until the date of the literature search, 19th March 2020, were used. All articles with the appropriate topics pertaining to COVID-19, dentistry, orthodontics, and infection control were used irrespective of language. The author did not state whether they were selective about the study type or design of articles screened. References of these articles were also screened, via the 'snowballing technique', to obtain as much relevant literature as possible.Data extraction and synthesis Articles were reviewed by the cited author, and one research assistant. Data was extracted from each study by this author. The data obtained was combined and discussed narratively, in a qualitative manner. Due to the broad scope of studies included, it was not possible to conduct a meta-analysis.Results This literature review describes ways to reduce COVID-19 transmission in orthodontic practice. Overview of the literature discusses how the virus may be transmitted in the orthodontic setting: by human-human contact; saliva; aerosols; and use of orthodontic instruments. The literature review illustrates the need for optimum infection control and strict cleaning, detailing surface disinfection and sterilisation protocols. It highlights the need for optimal hand hygiene, use of high standard personal protective equipment, controlling aerosol use, appropriate ventilation, and treating emergency cases only.Conclusions While there are no known cases of COVID-19 cross-transmission within the dental setting currently reported, utmost vigilance is required by orthodontic professionals to reduce risk of transmission. The review reinforces crucial measures required to reduce infection, as outlined in the Results section above. While the virus is still emerging, knowledge is limited and as such it is difficult to provide robust and complete recommendations for best practice. Further studies to inform future practice are required.","Carter, Annabelle",Evid Based Dent,,101

443514,The Relationship Between Social Vulnerability and COVID-19 Incidence Among Louisiana Census Tracts,2020,"BACKGROUND: A recent quarterly report released by Alberta Health reports that on average 2.5 Albertans die every day from accidental overdose deaths, and that between April 1, 2020, and June 30, 2020, the province lost a total of 301 people. In Canada, between January 2016 and March 2020, a total of 16,364 people died due to opioid-related overdose. The World Health Organization reports that 70% of the 0.5 million deaths worldwide caused by drugs are related to opioid overdose. Although supervised consumption sites or safe injection sites have been shown to be effective in reducing the harms associated with the use of illicit substances and increasing uptake of addiction treatment and other health services, there is still significant stigma associated with them, and it is unlikely that all of the people who would benefit from supervised consumption service will ever access a site. OBJECTIVE: To help prevent deaths in populations that cannot or will not access physical safer consumption services in Alberta, we propose to provide virtual (telephone-based) overdose response services, staffed by people with lived experience.The primary outcome for this study is uptake of the service as measured by the number of calls to the service. Secondary outcomes will include patterns of use of the phone line (days of the week and time of calls) and outcomes from the calls (number of emergency medical services dispatches for overdoses from the service and the results of those dispatches). METHODS: This phase 1 clinical study is set to officially launch in early May 2020. The service will be available to up to 15 participants who self-disclose as using opioids unobserved and have given informed consent for both data collection and interviews. This group will have access to a toll-free telephone number and be invited to call when they plan to use opioids alone. RESULTS: The analysis will include mixed methods. To improve the design of the service and ensure safety of all involved, quantitative data will be collected on phone calls and participant health care usage, while qualitative data will be collected from both participants and virtual overdose response operators. CONCLUSIONS: This clinical trial aims to test the feasibility of a service that provides virtual overdose response in order to help prevent deaths in populations that cannot or will not access physical supervised consumption services in Alberta.

While most search engine research is performed in academia with rigorous evaluation, major commercial companies dominate the web search market. Thus, it is expected that commercial pandemic-specific search engines will gain much higher traction than academic alternatives, leading to questions about the empirical performance of these tools. This paper seeks to empirically evaluate two commercial search engines for COVID-19 (Google and Amazon) in comparison with academic prototypes evaluated in the TREC-COVID task. We performed several steps to reduce bias in the manual judgments to ensure a fair comparison of all systems. We find the commercial search engines sizably underperformed those evaluated under TREC-COVID. This has implications for trust in popular health search engines and developing biomedical search engines for future health crises.","Soni, Sarvesh; Roberts, Kirk",J. am. med. inform. assoc,,101

An interactive web-based mapping platform that provides timely quantitative information on how people in different counties and states reacted to the social distancing guidelines was developed with the support of the National Science Foundation (NSF). It integrates geographic information systems (GIS) and daily updated human mobility statistical patterns derived from large-scale anonymized and aggregated smartphone location big data at the county-level in the United States, and aims to increase risk awareness of the public, support governmental decision-making, and help enhance community responses to the COVID-19 outbreak.","Gao, Song; Rao, Jinmeng; Kang, Yuhao; Liang, Yunlei; Kruse, Jake",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.04544v1.pdf,101

In 2019-20, the Hull York Medical School ran a pilot LIC for 6 fourth-year medical students. This work describes the longitudinal qualitative programme evaluation. LIC students participated in two focus groups, one after four months, and another at the end of the programme. In total, 16 faculty were also interviewed regarding their experiences in developing, implementing and running the LIC. Students' GP supervisors were difficult to engage in detailed evaluation due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and so were briefly surveyed at the end of the LIC. All data were pooled and analysed together using reflexive thematic analysis. Two major themes were identified: 'Trajectory of the LIC', describing the learning curve students and faculty encounter, and 'Institutional decision making', describing the need for clarity regarding the programme's purpose. The programme was largely positively received, but areas for improvement locally, and transferrable recommendations, were identified. Aligning assessment to programme aims is an important area for future development, alongside balancing structured with unstructured time, and supporting students as they navigate a J-shaped learning curve.","Brown, Megan E L; Crampton, Paul E S; Anderson, Kevin; Finn, Gabrielle M",Educ Prim Care,,101

460991,SuperNurse? Troubling the Hero Discourse in COVID Times,2020,"Comparing median outcomes to gauge treatment effectiveness is widespread practice in clinical and other investigations. While common, such difference-in-median characterizations of effectiveness are but one way to summarize how outcome distributions compare. This paper explores properties of median treatment effects (TEs) as indicators of treatment effectiveness. The paper's main focus is on decisionmaking based on median TEs and it proceeds by considering two paths a decisionmaker might follow. Along one, decisions are based on point-identified differences in medians alongside partially identified median differences; along the other decisions are based on point-identified differences in medians in conjunction with other point-identified parameters. On both paths familiar difference-in-median measures play some role yet in both the traditional standards are augmented with information that will often be relevant in assessing treatments' effectiveness. Implementing either approach is straightforward. In addition to its analytical results the paper considers several policy contexts in which such considerations arise. While the paper is framed by recently reported findings on treatments for COVID-19 and uses several such studies to explore empirically some properties of median-treatment-effect measures of effectiveness, its results should be broadly applicable.","Mullahy, John",Health Econ,,101

This article reports on a study of the relationship between self-reported health and life satisfaction before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in Norway, and examines the role of work in explaining the health–life satisfaction relationship. Method The study was based on survey data collected from 3,185 Norwegian employees in 2019 and 3,002 employees in 2020. Propensity score matching techniques were used to assess the mediating effects of work situations and income loss on the health–life satisfaction relationship. Skew-t regression models were further applied to estimate changes in life satisfaction before and during the pandemic, as well as to explore different underlying mechanisms for the health–life satisfaction association. Results The study found a negative association between ill health and life satisfaction. Compared to the healthy population, people with poor health were more likely to experience worsened work situations. A negative work situation is further associated with lower life satisfaction, and the pandemic aggravated life satisfaction for those who had worsened work situations. When exploring central contributing factors for life satisfaction, we found that health-related risks and work-life balance played predominant roles in predicting life satisfaction before the pandemic, while different types of household structure were among the most important predictors of life satisfaction during the pandemic. Conclusion A reduction in life satisfaction is explained by ill health, but different underlying mechanisms facilitated people’s life satisfaction before and during the pandemic. While work situation and health risks were important predictors for life satisfaction in 2019, worries about more unstable work situations and less access to family support accentuated worsened life satisfaction in 2020. The findings suggest the necessity of labour market interventions that address the security and maintenance of proper and predictable work situations, especially in these more uncertain times.","Bakkeli, Nan Zou",SSM - Population Health,,101
467361,Evaluating COVID-19 Public Service Information Through the Lens of Health Literacy,2020,"BACKGROUND: Pandemics disrupt traditional health care operations by overwhelming system resource capacity but also create opportunities for care innovation. OBJECTIVE: To describe the development and rapid deployment of a virtual hospital program, Atrium Health hospital at home (AH-HaH), within a large health care system. DESIGN: Prospective case series. SETTING: Atrium Health, a large integrated health care organization in the southeastern United States. PATIENTS: 1477 patients diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from 23 March to 7 May 2020 who received care via AH-HaH. INTERVENTION: A virtual hospital model providing proactive home monitoring and hospital-level care through a virtual observation unit (VOU) and a virtual acute care unit (VACU) in the home setting for eligible patients with COVID-19. MEASUREMENTS: Patient demographic characteristics, comorbid conditions, treatments administered (intravenous fluids, antibiotics, supplemental oxygen, and respiratory medications), transfer to inpatient care, and hospital outcomes (length of stay, intensive care unit [ICU] admission, mechanical ventilation, and death) were collected from electronic health record data. RESULTS: 1477 patients received care in either the AH-HaH VOU or VACU or both settings, with a median length of stay of 11 days. Of these, 1293 (88%) patients received care in the VOU only, with 40 (3%) requiring inpatient hospitalization. Of these 40 patients, 16 (40%) spent time in the ICU, 7 (18%) required ventilator support, and 2 (5%) died during their hospital admission. In total, 184 (12%) patients were ever admitted to the VACU, during which 21 patients (11%) required intravenous fluids, 16 (9%) received antibiotics, 40 (22%) required respiratory inhaler or nebulizer treatments, 41 (22%) used supplemental oxygen, and 24 (13%) were admitted as an inpatient to a conventional hospital. Of these 24 patients, 10 (42%) required ICU admission, 1 (3%) required a ventilator, and none died during their hospital admission. LIMITATION: Generalizability is limited to patients with a working telephone and the ability to comply with the monitoring protocols. CONCLUSION: Virtual hospital programs have the potential to provide health systems with additional inpatient capacity during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.

Using National Syndromic Surveillance Program (NSSP) data from January 6, 2019-September 6, 2020, CDC tabulated weekly numbers of emergency department (ED) visits related to child abuse and neglect and calculated the proportions of such visits per 100,000 ED visits, as well as the percentage of suspected or confirmed ED visits related to child abuse and neglect ending in hospitalization, overall and stratified by age group (0-4, 5-11, and 12-17 years). The total number of ED visits related to child abuse and neglect began decreasing below the corresponding 2019 period during week 11 (March 15-March 22, 2020) for all age groups examined, coinciding with the declaration of a national emergency on March 13 (2); simultaneously, the proportion of these visits per 100,000 ED visits began increasing above the 2019 baseline for all age groups. Despite decreases in the weekly number of ED visits related to child abuse and neglect, the weekly number of these visits resulting in hospitalization remained stable in 2020; however, the yearly percentage of ED visits related to child abuse and neglect resulting in hospitalization increased significantly among all age groups. Although the increased proportion of ED visits related to child abuse and neglect might be associated with a decrease in the overall number of ED visits, these findings also suggest that health care-seeking patterns have shifted during the pandemic. Hospitalizations for child abuse and neglect did not decrease in 2020, suggesting that injury severity did not decrease during the pandemic, despite decreased ED visits. Child abuse is preventable; implementation of strategies including strengthening household economic supports and creating family-friendly work policies can reduce stress during difficult times and increase children's opportunities to thrive in safe, stable, and nurturing relationships and environments (3).","Swedo, Elizabeth; Idaikkadar, Nimi; Leemis, Ruth; Dias, Taylor; Radhakrishnan, Lakshmi; Stein, Zachary; Chen, May; Agathis, Nickolas; Holland, Kristin",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,101

472083,A health crisis within a health crisis: Opioid access in the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"One of the greatest challenges facing the humankind nowadays is to confront that emerging virus, which is the Coronavirus (COVID-19), and therefore all organizations have to unite in order to tackle that the transmission risk of this virus. From this standpoint, the scientific researchers have to find good mathematical models that do describe the transmission of such virus and contribute to reducing it in one way or another, where the study of COVID-19 transmission dynamics by mathematical models is very important for analyzing and controlling this disease propagation. Thus, in the current work, we present a new fractional-order mathematical model that describes the dynamics of COVID-19. In the proposed model, the total population is divided into eight classes, in addition to three compartments used to estimate the parameters and initial values. The effective reproduction number ( R 0 ) is derived by next generation matrix (NGM) method and all possible equilibrium points and their stability are investigated in details. We used the reported data (from January 23, 2020, to November 21, 2020) from the National Health Commission (NHC) of China to estimate the parameters and initial conditions (ICs) which suggested for our model. Simulation outcomes demonstrate that the fractional order model (FOM) represents behaviors that follow the real data more accurately than the integer-order model. The current work enhances the recent reported results of Zu et al. published in THE LANCET (doi:10.2139/ssrn.3539669).","Ameen, Ismail Gad; Ali, Hegagi Mohamed; Alharthi, M R; Abdel-Aty, Abdel-Haleem; Elshehabey, Hillal M",Results Phys,,101

Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in the centers participating in the ARGEN-IAM-ST registry, to investigate the institutional organization, outpatient care, hospitalization in critical care areas and the situation of health care workers. Results: A total of 80 centers were surveyed; 55% were public institutions and 97% had critical care areas. Ninety-one percent of the institutions created a crisis committee due to the pandemic and 65% took measures for outpatient care due to social distancing. In 89% of the centers hospitalizations due to cardiovascular diseases declined by 57% (SD ± 18) and in 24% of the centers health care workers became infected with SARS-CoV-2. Conclusion: A high percentage of centers participating in the ARGEN-IAM-ST continuous registry created crisis committees to reorganize the delivery of health care services; almost two thirds of them took measures for outpatient follow-up and there was a significant decline in bed occupancy for patients with cardiovascular diseases.","D’imperio, Heraldo; Gagliardi, Juan; Zoni, Rodrigo; Charask, Andrián; Costa, Yanina Castillo; Marturano, María Pía; Quiroga, Walter; Macín, Stella",Rev.

These varied mechanisms can be better understood when combined with the study of the ultrastructural morphological variability of spermatozoa. Within the coral snakes, genus Micrurus, there are differences in the reproductive strategies adopted between monads (BRM) and triads (BRT); the aim of this work was to relate these two strategies to morphological differences among spermatozoa within different species. The semen of six Micrurus was collected using a non-invasive technique, fixed and processed for scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Micrurus spermatozoa have the same ultrastructure as those of other snake species, comprising the head, divided into acrosome, nucleus and neck; the midpiece; and the two parts of the tail, the principal piece and the end piece. Micrurus corallinus and Micrurus surinamensis presented evident multilaminar membranes occurring along all the pieces, while Micrurus frontalis and Micrurus altirostris showed cytoplasmic droplets occurring mainly in the midpiece. The differences found in spermatozoa morphology may be related with sperm storage in these four coral snakes, since the development of multilaminar membranes in the midpiece and the maintenance of cytoplasmic droplets in the mature sperm are both features related to extra energy provision for the spermatozoa while stored.","Coeti, Rafaela Zani; Antoniazzi, Marta Maria; Sánchez, Raúl; Almeida-Santos, Selma Maria",Zool.

METHODS: Between 16 April 2020 and 3 August 2020, we conducted a cross-sectional survey with a global sample of trans and non-binary people (n=849) through an online social networking app. We conducted structural equational modelling procedures to determine direct, indirect and overall effects between poor mental health (ie, depression and anxiety) and latent variables across socioecological levels: social (ie, reduction in gender affirming services, socioeconomic loss impact) and environmental factors (ie, COVID-19 pandemic environment). RESULTS: Anxiety (45.82%) and depression (50.88%) in this sample were prevalent and directly linked to COVID-19 pandemic environment. Adjusted for gender identity, age, migrant status, region, education and level of socioeconomic status, our final model showed significant positive associations between relationships of (1) COVID-19 pandemic environment and socioeconomic loss impact (ß=0.62, p<0.001), (2) socioeconomic loss impact and reduction in gender affirming services (ß=0.24, p<0.05) and (3) reduction in gender affirming services and poor mental health (ß=0.19, p<0.05). Moreover, socioeconomic loss impact and reduction in gender affirming services were found to be partial mediators in this model. CONCLUSION: The study results supported the importance of bolstering access to gender affirming services and strengthening socioeconomic opportunities and programmatic support to buffer the impact of COVID-19 pandemic environment on poor mental health among trans and non-binary communities globally.","Restar, Arjee Javellana; Jin, Harry; Jarrett, Brooke; Adamson, Tyler; Baral, Stefan David; Howell, Sean; Beckham, S Wilson",,,101

486398,Implementing remote triage in large health systems: A qualitative evidence synthesis,2021,"INTRODUCTION: A novel coronavirus, designated SARS-CoV-2, caused an international outbreak of a respiratory illness, termed COVID-19 in December 2019. There is a lack of specific therapeutic agents based on evidence for this novel coronavirus infection; however, several medications have been evaluated as a potential therapy. Therapy is required to treat symptomatic patients and decrease the virus carriage duration to limit the communitytransmission. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We hypothesise that patients with mild COVID-19 treated with favipiravir will have a shorter duration of time to virus clearance than the control group. The primary outcome is to evaluate the effect of favipiravir on the timing of the PCR test conversion from positive to negative within 15 days after starting the medicine.Adults (>18 years, men or nonpregnant women, diagnosed with mild COVID-19 within 5 days of disease onset) are being recruited by physicians participating from the Ministry of National Guard Health Affairs and the Ministry of Health ethics committee approved primary healthcare centres. This double-blind, randomised trial comprises three significant parts: screening, treatment and a follow-up period. The treating physician and patients are blinded. Eligible participants are randomised in a 1:1 ratio to either the therapy group (favipiravir) or a control group (placebo) with 1800 mg by mouth two times per day for the first day, followed by 800 mg two times per day for 4-7 days. Serial nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swab samples are obtained on day 1 (5 days before therapy). On day5±1 day, 10±1 day, 15±2 days, extra nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal PCR COVID-19 samples are requested.The primary analysis population for evaluating both the efficacy and safety outcomes will be a modified intention to treat population. Anticipating a 10% dropout rate, we expect to recruit 288 subjects per arm. The results assume that the hazard ratio is constant throughout the study and that the Cox proportional hazard regression is used to analyse the data. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study was approved by the King Abdullah International Medical Research Centre Institutional Review Board (28 April 2020) and the Ministry of Health Institutional Review Board (1 July 2020). Protocol details and any amendments will be reported to https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04464408. The results will be published in peer-reviewed journals.

A cross-section of 1317 U.S. metropolitan, acute care, not-for-profit hospitals for the year 2015 was employed. We use a frontier method, stochastic frontier analysis, to estimate hospital efficiency. Total margin and operating margin were used as profit variables in OLS regressions that were corrected for heteroskedacity. In addition to estimated efficiency, control variables for internal and external correlates of profitability were included in the regression models. We found that more efficient hospitals were also more profitable. The results show a positive relationship between profitability and size, concentration of output, occupancy rate and membership in a multi-hospital system. An inverse relationship was found between profits and academic medical centers, average length of stay, location in a Medicaid expansion state, Medicaid and Medicare share of admissions, and unemployment rate. The results of a Hausman test indicates that efficiency is exogenous in the profit equations. The findings suggest that not-for-profit hospitals will be responsive to incentives for increasing efficiency and use market power to increase surplus to pursue their objectives.","Rosko, Michael; Al-Amin, Mona; Tavakoli, Manouchehr",Int. j. health economics manag.

It is important that compliance with the principles of GLP continues to be maintained. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic lockdowns in various countries, including India, have been sudden and over an extended duration. Although every GLP laboratory has Standard Operating Procedure for disaster management, the sudden lockdown due to COVID-19 created specific emergency procedures related to this situation such as travel bans, safe distancing, and work from home notifications. Good Laboratory Practice compliances in the context of animal experimentation during and post lockdown period need effective managerial responses that are not just flexible and innovative but can ensure they are well-calibrated to the challenges of business continuity and maintenance of health directives. On-the-ground realities suggest there may still be practical challenges to compliance, and guidelines may not always be complied with. This article discusses the issues that may be encountered due to COVID-19 that could potentially impact the GLP status of a study and suggests ways to manage them so as to minimize or prevent infection with COVID-19. We propose an MMM (Man, Material, and Medium) strategy to ensure compliance with health directives and guidelines that will help staff to keep themselves and others safe in the workplace while endeavoring to comply with GLP requirements.","Wangikar, Pralhad; Giridhar, T R; Shanmugam, Prakash Srinivasan Timiri",Int J Toxicol,,101

The docking situation, pharmacology and toxicity prediction results are good. The model can be used to predict the bioactivity of the same type of new compounds and their derivatives. The prediction results of molecular design, molecular docking and ADMET can provide some ideas for the design and development of novel mIDH1 inhibitor anticancer drugs, and provide certain theoretical basis of the experimental verification of new compounds in the future. Newly designed molecules after docking with corresponding proteins in the PDB library, it can explore the targets of drug molecules acting with large proteins and the related force, which is very helpful for the design of new drugs and the mechanism of drug action.","Tong, Jian-Bo; Bian, Shuai; Zhang, Xing; Luo, Ding",Mol. divers,,101
497188,Prison health: five minutes with . . . Alan Mitchell,2021,"OBJECTIVE: To describe changes in socioeconomic and health conditions of Brazilians during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODOLOGY: Cross-sectional study with data from a web-based behavioral survey carried out from April 24 to May 24, 2020, with 45,161 participants recruited by the chain sampling method. A descriptive analysis of the survey topics was performed: adherence to social restriction measures, diagnosis of the new coronavirus, work situation and income, difficulties in routine activities, presence of comorbidities, psychological issues, and access to health services. Prevalence and respective 95% confidence intervals were estimated. RESULTS: Approximately 74% of Brazilians adhered to social restrictions. As for flu symptoms, 28.1% reported having at least one flu symptom, but only 5.9% underwent testing for COVID-19. Regarding the socioeconomic impact, 55.1% reported a decrease in family income, and 7.0% were left without any income; 25.8% of the people lost their jobs, with the group of informal workers being the most affected (50.6%). As for health conditions, 29.4% reported worsening of health status; 45%, having sleep problems; 40% frequently presented feelings of sadness, and 52.5%, of anxiety; 21.7% sought health care, and, among them, 13.9% did not get care. CONCLUSION: The findings show the importance of controlling the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil, to mitigate the adverse effects on the socioeconomic and health conditions related to social restriction measures.","Almeida, Wanessa da Silva de; Szwarcwald, Célia Landmann; Malta, Deborah Carvalho; Barros, Marilisa Berti de Azevedo; Souza Júnior, Paulo Roberto Borges de; Azevedo, Luiz Otávio; Romero, Dália; Lima, Margareth Guimarães; Damacena, Giseli Nogueira; Machado, Ísis Eloah; Gomes, Crizian Saar; Pina, Maria de Fátima de; Gracie, Renata; Werneck, André Oliveira; Silva, Danilo Rodrigues Pereira da",Rev Bras Epidemiol,,101

A pandemic is characterized by uncertainty, high potential loss, time pressure, and competing values, all posing challenges to EBM. Drawing on events in government responses to COVID-19, this essay focuses on three issues: What should be considered as evidence in pandemic-like situations? How can we make evidence more accessible to decision makers in such situations? And, does evidence have a role in ethical judgments in a pandemic? The essay argues that EBM must be extended to address pandemic-like situations. The evidentiary standard should take into consideration “appropriateness,” “reasonableness,” and “intuition,” paying attention to the stages of a pandemic and the type of errors we want to avoid. In addition, the essay calls for building policy capacity in terms of coproducing and applying evidence in and outside government, as well as strengthening public managers’ capacity in evidence-based ethical analysis.","Yang, Kaifeng",Am.

499614,"Impact of lockdown on learning status of undergraduate and postgraduate students during COVID-19 pandemic in West Bengal, India",2020,"OBJECTIVES: Better understanding of the dynamics of the COVID-19 (2019 novel coronavirus disease) pandemic to curb its spread is now a global imperative. While travel restrictions and control measures have been shown to limit the spread of the disease, the effectiveness of the enforcement of those measures should depend on the strength of the government. Whether, and how, the government plays a role in fighting the disease, however, has not been investigated. Here, we show that government management capacities are critical to the containment of the disease. SETTING: We conducted a statistical analysis based on cross-city comparisons within China. China has undergone almost the entire cycle of the anticoronavirus campaign, which allows us to trace the full dynamics of the outbreak, with homogeneity in standards for statistics recording. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcome measures include city-specific COVID-19 case incidence and recoveries in China. RESULTS: The containment of COVID-19 depends on the effectiveness of the enforcement of control measures, which in turn depends on the local government's management capacities. Specifically, government efficiency, capacity for law enforcement, and the transparency of laws and policies significantly reduce COVID-19 prevalence and increase the likelihood of recoveries. The organisation size of the government, which is not closely related to its capacity for management, has a limited role.","Li, Wenchao; Li, Jing; Yi, Junjian",BMJ Open,,101

We conducted empirical analyses using linear regression, a time-varying effect model, and a regression discontinuity design to investigate the association of medical resources with the mortality rate of the COVID-19 patients in Hubei, China. The results showed that the numbers of hospital beds, healthcare system beds, and medical staff per confirmed cases all had significant negative effects on the coronavirus disease mortality rate. Furthermore, in the context of the severe pandemic currently being experienced worldwide, the present study summarized the experience and implications in pandemic prevention and control in Hubei province from the perspective of medical resource integration as follows: First, hospitals' internal medical resources were integrated, breaking interdepartmental barriers. Second, joint pandemic control was realized by integrating regional healthcare system resources. Finally, an external medical resource allocation system was developed.","Xie, Lin; Yang, Hualei; Zheng, Xiaodong; Wu, Yuanyang; Lin, Xueyu; Shen, Zheng",PLoS One,,101
500479,COVID-19 UK Lockdown Forecasts and R 0,2020,"The pandemic coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 threatens public health worldwide. The viral spike protein mediates SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells and harbors a S1/S2 cleavage site containing multiple arginine residues (multibasic) not found in closely related animal coronaviruses. However, the role of this multibasic cleavage site in SARS-CoV-2 infection is unknown. Here, we report that the cellular protease furin cleaves the spike protein at the S1/S2 site and that cleavage is essential for S-protein-mediated cell-cell fusion and entry into human lung cells. Moreover, optimizing the S1/S2 site increased cell-cell, but not virus-cell, fusion, suggesting that the corresponding viral variants might exhibit increased cell-cell spread and potentially altered virulence. Our results suggest that acquisition of a S1/S2 multibasic cleavage site was essential for SARS-CoV-2 infection of humans and identify furin as a potential target for therapeutic intervention.","Hoffmann, Markus; Kleine-Weber, Hannah; Pöhlmann, Stefan",Mol Cell,,101

Synergistic effects may decrease required concentrations and shorten exposure durations for treatments. We investigated four toxicants (EarthTec QZ, Clam-Trol CT-2, niclosamide, and potassium chloride) that have been considered to control invasive zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha Pallas, 1771). We determined the toxicity of binary mixtures for five different mixture ratios to adult mussels. We compared our observations to predictions made with concentration addition and independent action paradigms, as based on the dose-response relationships of each individual toxicant. We calculated the model deviation ratio for each combination at the LC50 and LC90 and identified three possible interactions: synergy, antagonism, and additivity. We found that mixtures of niclosamide and Clam-Trol CT-2 were the most synergistic while mixtures that included potassium chloride were largely additive to antagonistic. The use of synergistic combinations has potential to decrease the overall volume and concentration of individual toxicants required for dreissenid mussel treatments, thereby decreasing cost.","Barbour, Matthew T; Schueller, Justin R; Severson, Todd J; Wise, Jeremy K; Meulemans, Matthew J; Luoma, James A; Waller, Diane L",Aquat Toxicol,,101
504323,SNAP Participants and High Levels of Food Insecurity in the Early Stages of the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: Blood collection center (BCC) employees are essential workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. The employee callout rate, defined as the percentage of scheduled employees unable to report to work for any cause including COVID-19 illness or asymptomatic quarantine, was tracked to determine the impact of safety measures including social distancing, masks, enhanced disinfection protocols, and temperature screening. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A contact tracing and quarantine program was implemented for all employees, followed by additional safety measures including social distancing, masks, enhanced disinfection protocols, and temperature screening. The weekly callout rate was tracked nationally for 19,517 BCC employees over 9 months, from March to December 2020. RESULTS: Weekly employee callout rates increased after implementation of the contact tracing program due to asymptomatic employees placed into COVID-19-related quarantine. Mobile collections callouts increased by nearly fivefold the pre-pandemic baseline within the first 4 weeks, peaking at 9.7% in early April. Peaks for fixed site collections (5.0%) and manufacturing (6.7%) occurred nearly simultaneously. Shortly after implementation of all safety measures, the weekly callout rate declined for all three employee groups and has remained relatively stable with a mean callout rate of 4.3% for mobile collections, 2.4% for fixed site collections, and 3.7% for manufacturing despite further increase in new COVID-19 cases in the United States. CONCLUSION: Callouts for BCC employees during the COVID-19 pandemic initially increased, but subsequently declined and stabilized after implementation of safety measures. Since multiple interventions were implemented simultaneously, it is not possible to determine the individual impact of each measure on callout rate.","Coberly, Emily; Korich, Erin; Henesy, Michelle; Doerksen, Kate; Young, Pampee",Transfusion,,101

Tertiles of two measures of rural-urban status were used: Rural-Urban Commuting Areas (RUCAs) and population density. Bivariate and multivariable binary and ordinal logistic regression were used to asses study objectives. Using RUCAs, rural informal caregivers were more than twice as likely as urban informal caregivers to report a substantial increase in CB due to COVID-19 (OR 2.27, 95% CI [1.28–4.02]). Similar results were observed for population density tertiles (OR 2.20, 95% CI [1.22–3.96]). Having a COVID-19 diagnosis was also significantly associated with increased CB. Understanding and addressing the root causes of rural-urban disparities in CB among informal caregivers is critical to improving caregiver health and maintaining this critical component of the healthcare system.","Cohen, S.

PROGRAM: We describe logistics of establishing and operating isolation and noncongregate hotels for COVID-19 mitigation and use the isolation hotel as an opportunity to understand COVID-19 symptom evolution among people experiencing homelessness (PEH). IMPLEMENTATION: Multiple agencies in Atlanta, Georgia, established an isolation hotel for PEH with COVID-19 and noncongregate hotel for PEH without COVID-19 but at risk of severe illness. PEH were referred to the isolation hotel through proactive, community-based testing and hospital-based testing. Daily symptoms were recorded prospectively. Disposition location was recorded for all clients. EVALUATION: During April 10 to September 1, 2020, 181 isolation hotel clients (77 community referrals; 104 hospital referrals) were admitted a median 3 days after testing. Overall, 32% of community referrals and 7% of hospital referrals became symptomatic after testing positive; 83% of isolation hotel clients reported symptoms at some point; 93% completed isolation. Among 302 noncongregate hotel clients, median stay was 18 weeks; 61% were discharged to permanent housing or had a permanent housing discharge plan. DISCUSSION: Overall, a high proportion of PEH completed isolation at the hotel, suggesting a high level of acceptability. Many PEH with COVID-19 diagnosed in the community developed symptoms after testing, indicating that proactive, community-based testing can facilitate early isolation. Noncongregate hotels can be a useful COVID-19 community mitigation strategy by bridging PEH at risk of severe illness to permanent housing.","Montgomery, Martha P; Paulin, Heather N; Morris, Asher; Cotton, Afrika; Speers, Austin; Boyd, Andrew T; Buff, Ann M; Mathews, Darlene; Wells, Alyssa; Marchman, Cathryn; Gaffga, Nicholas; Bamrah Morris, Sapna; Cavanaugh, Sean S",J Public Health Manag Pract,,101

METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed, EuropePMC, ProQuest, and Cochrane Central Databases using the terms ""(COVID-19 OR SARS-CoV-2) AND (angiotensin converting enzyme OR angiotensin receptor blocker)"". The primary and second outcomes were mortality (non-survivor) and severe COVID-19, respectively. RESULTS: Totally, 7410 patients were included from 15 studies. Pooled analysis showed that the use of ACEI/ARB was not associated with mortality (OR 0.73 [0.38, 1.40], p = 0.34; I2: 81%) and severity (OR 1.03 [0.73, 1.45], p = 0.87; I2: 65%). Pooled adjusted OR showed no risk/benefit associated with ACEI/ARB use in terms of mortality (OR 0.83 [0.54, 1.27], p = 0.38; I2: 0%). Subgroup analysis showed that the use of ARB was associated with reduced mortality (OR 0.51 [0.29, 0.90], p = 0.02; I2: 22%) but not ACEI subgroup (OR 0.68 [0.39, 1.17], p = 0.16; I2: 0%). Meta-regression showed that the association between ACEI/ARB use and mortality in patients with COVID-19 do not varies by gender (p = 0.104). GRADE showed a very low certainty of evidence for effect of ACEI/ARB on mortality and severity. The certainty of evidence was very low for both ACEI and ARB subgroups.

RESULTS: Compared to pre-pandemic, post-pandemic time spent in standing declined by 32.7% (Cohen's d = 0.78, p < 0.01), walking by 52.2% (d = 1.1, p < 0.01), step-counts by 55.1% (d = 1.0, p = 0.016), and postural transitions by 44.6% (d = 0.82, p = 0.017) with increase in sitting duration by 20.5% (d = 0.5, p = 0.049). Depression symptoms increased by 150% (d = 0.8, p = 0.046). Interestingly, increase in depression was significantly correlated with unbroken-prolong sitting bout (&#961; = 0.677, p = 0.032), cadence (&#961; = -0.70, p = 0.024), and sleep duration (&#961; = -0.72, p = 0.019). CONCLUSION: This is one of the early longitudinal studies highlighting adverse effect of the pandemic on objectively assessed physical activity and sleep in older adults. Our observations showed need for timely intervention to mitigate hard to reverse consequences of decreased physical activity such as depression.","Mishra, Ramkinker; Park, Catherine; York, Michele K; Kunik, Mark E; Wung, Shu-Fen; Naik, Aanand D; Najafi, Bijan",Sensors (Basel),,101
511806,First local transmission cluster of COVID-19 in Malaysia: public health response,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To identify theoretical and technical aspects regarding treatment, prevention of spread and protection of staff to inform the development of a comprehensive training curriculum on COVID-19 management. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Nine hospitals caring for patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. PARTICIPANTS: 134 Chinese healthcare professionals (74 doctors and 60 nurses) who were deployed to Wuhan, China during the COVID-19 epidemic were included. A two-round Delphi process was initiated between March and May 2020. In the first round, the participants identified knowledge, technical and behavioural (ie, non-technical) skills that are needed to treat patients, prevent spread of the virus and protect healthcare workers. In round 2, the participants rated each item according to its importance to be included in a training curriculum on COVID-19. Consensus for inclusion in the final list was set at 80%. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Knowledge, technical and behavioural (ie, non-technical) skills that could form the basis of a training curriculum for COVID-19 management. RESULTS: In the first round 1398 items were suggested by the doctors and reduced to 67 items after content analysis (treatment of patients: n=47; infection prevention and control: n=20). The nurses suggested 1193 items that were reduced to 70 items (treatment of patients: n=49; infection prevention and control: n=21). In round 2, the response rates were 82% in doctors and 93% in nurses. Fifty-eight items of knowledge, technical and behavioural skills were agreed on by the doctors to include in the final list. For the nurses, 58 items were agreed on. CONCLUSIONS: This needs assessment process resulted in a comprehensive list of knowledge, technical and behavioural skills for COVID-19 management. Educators can use these to guide decisions regarding content of training curricula not only for COVID-19 management but also in preparation for future viral pandemic outbreaks.","Hou, Xun; Hu, Wenjie; Russell, Lene; Kuang, Ming; Konge, Lars; Nayahangan, Leizl Joy",BMJ Open,,101

We conducted a multiancestry meta-analysis of prostate cancer genome-wide association studies (107,247 cases and 127,006 controls) and identified 86 new genetic risk variants independently associated with prostate cancer risk, bringing the total to 269 known risk variants. The top genetic risk score (GRS) decile was associated with odds ratios that ranged from 5.06 (95% confidence interval (CI), 4.84-5.29) for men of European ancestry to 3.74 (95% CI, 3.36-4.17) for men of African ancestry. Men of African ancestry were estimated to have a mean GRS that was 2.18-times higher (95% CI, 2.14-2.22), and men of East Asian ancestry 0.73-times lower (95% CI, 0.71-0.76), than men of European ancestry.

513036,Changes in workflow to a University Pharmacy to facilitate compounding and distribution of antiseptics for use against COVID-19,2020,"The ability to preferentially protect high-risk groups in COVID-19 is hotly debated. Here, the aim is to present simple metrics of such precision shielding of people at high risk of death after infection by SARS-CoV-2; demonstrate how they can estimated; and examine whether precision shielding was successfully achieved in the first COVID-19 wave. The shielding ratio, S, is defined as the ratio of prevalence of infection among people in a high-risk group versus among people in a low-risk group. The contrasted risk groups examined here are according to age (&#8805;70 vs <70 years), and institutionalised (nursing home) setting. For age-related precision shielding, data were used from large seroprevalence studies with separate prevalence data for elderly versus non-elderly and with at least 1000 assessed people&#8805;70 years old. For setting-related precision shielding, data were analysed from 10 countries where information was available on numbers of nursing home residents, proportion of nursing home residents among COVID-19 deaths and overall population infection fatality rate (IFR). Across 17 seroprevalence studies, the shielding ratio S for elderly versus non-elderly varied between 0.4 (substantial shielding) and 1.6 (substantial inverse protection, that is, low-risk people being protected more than high-risk people). Five studies in the USA all yielded S=0.4-0.8, consistent with some shielding being achieved, while two studies in China yielded S=1.5-1.6, consistent with inverse protection. Assuming 25% IFR among nursing home residents, S values for nursing home residents ranged from 0.07 to 3.1. The best shielding was seen in South Korea (S=0.07) and modest shielding was achieved in Israel, Slovenia, Germany and Denmark. No shielding was achieved in Hungary and Sweden. In Belgium (S=1.9), the UK (S=2.2) and Spain (S=3.1), nursing home residents were far more frequently infected than the rest of the population. In conclusion, the experience from the first wave of COVID-19 suggests that different locations and settings varied markedly in the extent to which they protected high-risk groups. Both effective precision shielding and detrimental inverse protection can happen in real-life circumstances. COVID-19 interventions should seek to achieve maximal precision shielding.","Ioannidis, John P A",,,101

This case report presents the first case of reinfection from Saudi Arabia, and probably the first dental student to have been re-infected with COVID-19. A 24-year-old male dental student presents with reinfection after a period of three months since he was first infected with COVID-19. The signs and symptoms reported by the patient were similar in both instances, except that he developed fever only at the time of reinfection. The infection and reinfection were confirmed with a RT-PCR test reports. This report highlights how it is necessary to continue to observe all the prescriptions recently indicated in the literature in order to avoid new contagion for all health workers after healed from covid-19 or asymptomatic positive, since as seen sometimes the infection does not ensures complete immunity in 100% of cases.","Fageeh, Hytham; Alshehri, Abdulrahman; Fageeh, Hammam; Bizzoca, Maria E; Lo Muzio, Lorenzo; Quadri, Mir F A",J Infect Public Health,,101

515235,Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the mental balance among health care workers,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a number of fundamental changes in different societies, and can therefore be understood as creating ""disjuncture"" in our lives. Disjuncture is a concept proposed by adult educator Peter Jarvis to describe the phenomenon of what happens when an individual is confronted with an experience that conflicts with her/his previous understanding of the world. Faced with a situation that creates disjuncture, the person is compelled to find new knowledge and new ways of doing things; i.e., he/she must embark on a learning process. The recent introduction of social distancing as a measure aiming to reduce transmission of the COVID-19 virus has dramatically changed people's behaviour, but this measure does not only have preventive and desirable effects. There is an associated risk for increased isolation among the older generations of the population, as well as a change in intergenerational relationships. Although the current pandemic (as disjuncture) may potentially initiate major learning processes in the human collective, we should remember that disjuncture is often theorised within neutral, or even positive, contexts. In a context of fear, however, learning may result in a narrowing of mindsets and a rejection of collective efforts and solidarity between generations. In terms of the types of learning triggered by the current pandemic (as disjuncture), one problem is non-reflective learning, which primarily occurs on a behavioural level. We need to recognise this and engage in reflective learning if we are to make the choices that will lead to a society that is worth living in for all generations. Our goal must be to learn to be a person in a post-pandemic society.","Bjursell, Cecilia",Int Rev Educ,,101

A Mixed-Methods Reasoned Action Approach Applied to Health Communication,2020,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Macro-arteriovenous fistulas (MAVFs) are arteriovenous shunts draining into a giant venous ectasia. They can be treated by surgery or embolisation. Angiographic controls are usually performed rapidly after treatment in order to prove the cure of the lesion but no long term angiographies are generally scheduled. We wanted to control the stabilities of such lesions at follow-up. METHOD: Clinical history and imaging of ninety-five patients with high flow shunts draining into venous ectasias (MAVFs, Vein of Galen malformations and dilatations) were reviewed. RESULTS: De novo arteriovenous shunts related to angiogenesis involving vasa vasorum developed in three patients with MAVFs at various intervals. Genetic underlying conditions as HHT or RASA 1 mutations were suspected in each patient. CONCLUSIONS: Neo-angiogenesis can occur after cure of MAVFs. Long term imaging follow-ups should be considered as the natural history of such recurrent shunts is currently unknown.","Tsang, Chun Pong; Mizutani, Katsuhiro; Trenkler, Johannes; Holmin, Staffan; Rodesch, Georges",J. neuroradiol,,101

A Mixed-Methods Reasoned Action Approach Applied to Health Communication,2020,"Severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is characterized by an unpredictable disease course, with variable presentations of different organ systems. The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 are highly variable ranging from mild presentations to severe, life-threatening symptoms and the wide individual variability may be due to the broad heterogeneity in the underlying pathologies. There is no doubt that early management may have a major influence on the outcome. This led the scientists to search for ways to monitor disease progression or to predict outcomes in COVID-19. Although it is not yet possible to predict who will progress to the severe forms or in what time, numerous prospective and longitudinal studies represent the evidence for determining the potential immunological risk factors of COVID-19 critical disease and death. The kinetics and breadth of immune responses during COVID-19 appear to follow a trend which is consistent to the predominant pathological alterations. Recent publications have used these biomarkers to help identify patients who will develop the severe acute COVID-19. Of particular interest is the relationship between the kinetics of peripheral leukocytes and clinical progress of the disease in COVID-19. Although research is ongoing in this area, we present details about the current status of the evaluation. Understanding of the COVID-19 related alterations of the innate and adaptive immune responses may help to promote the vaccine development and immunological interventions.","Ghaebi, Mahnaz; Tahmasebi, Safa; Jozghorbani, Maryam; Sadeghi, Alireza; Thangavelu, Lakshmi; Zekiy, Angelina Olegovna; Esmaeilzadeh, Abdolreza",Life Sci,,101

521169,Extended reality in educating the next generation of health professionals,2021,"Containment of pandemic infections mainly depends on prompt identification of carriers, achievable through strict surveillance and truthful diagnostic testing. Although molecular identification of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the gold standard method, its low sensitivity and long turnaround time are among major concerns. In this retrospective single-center study, we reviewed the results of the lymphocyte and neutrophil counts of 1450 Iranian patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) recruited at Baqiyatallah Hospital, Tehran, Iran. Of 1450 patients, 439 cases (30.3%) were polymerase chain reaction (PCR) negative;further emphasizing that getting negative molecular testing is not as reliable as a positive result. While the lymphocyte count in cases with less than 50 years old was 1.8x103/microL (1.2-2.5), it was 1.47x103/microL (0.84-2.16) in the older group (p&lt;0.001). Also, men experienced lower lymphocytes as compared to women (1.53x103/microL vs 1.76x103/microL;p=0.002). Of particular interest, the lymphocyte count in the PCR-negative cases was 1.77x103/microL (0.98-2.45) which was significantly higher than its count in their positive counterparts (1.53x103/microL;p=0.004). Unlike lymphocytes, sex and PCR did not significantly affect the number of neutrophils. The odds ratio for neutrophilia in patients aged older than 50, either with a negative or a positive PCR, was 2.46 and 2.23, suggesting old age as the most significant associated factor. The number of lymphocytes along with increased neutrophil count may probably serve as simple, rapid, and economical biomarkers, and are seemingly appropriate items that should be taken into account in the identification of patients with COVID-19, especially those aged more than 50.","Bashash, D.; Abolghasemi, H.; Naseri, P.; Cheraghali, A.

521534,Impact Of Covid-19 Stay-at-home Restrictions And Employment Changes On Physical Activity And Sedentary Behavior Changes,2021,"INTRODUCTION: With the proliferation of virtual learning programs during the COVID-19 pandemic, there is increased need to understand learner experiences and impact on developing expertise. Project Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes (Project ECHO®) is an established hub-and-spoke tele-education model aimed at building capacity and expertise in primary care providers. Our qualitative study explored how learning experiences within an ECHO mental health care program supported provider learning and ability to solve complex clinical problems. METHODS: We sampled ECHO sessions across a 34-week cycle and analyzed audio transcribed data. Two individuals coded participant interactions during 2-hour recorded sessions using an iterative, constant comparative methodology. RESULTS: The authors identified four key mechanisms of learning in ECHO: (1) fostering participants' productive struggle with cases, (2) development of an integrated understanding, (3) collaborative reformulation of cases, and (4) generation of conceptual solutions based on a new understanding. Throughout the ECHO sessions, learning was observed to be multidirectional from both the hub-to-spoke and between spoke sites. DISCUSSION: Despite the widespread implementation of Project ECHO and other virtual learning models, a paucity of research has focused on mechanisms of virtual learning within these models. Our study demonstrated a bidirectional exchange of knowledge between hub specialist teams and primary care provider spokes that aligned with the development of adaptive expertise through specific learning experiences in Project ECHO. Moreover, the ECHO structure may further support the development of adaptive expertise to better prepare participants to address patients' complex mental health needs.","Sockalingam, Sanjeev; Rajaratnam, Thiyake; Zhou, Carrol; Serhal, Eva; Crawford, Allison; Mylopoulos, Maria",J Contin Educ Health Prof,,101

We examined the role of socioeconomic, mental health, and pro-inflammatory factors in a community-based sample. METHODS: We used data on 340,966 men and women (mean age 56.2 years) from the UK Biobank study, a prospective cohort study with linkage to hospitalisation for COVID-19. Logistic regression models were used to estimate associations between ethnicity and hospitalisation for COVID-19. RESULTS: There were 640 COVID-19 cases (571/324,306 White, 31/4,485 Black, 21/5,732 Asian, 17/5,803 Other). Compared to the White study members and after adjusting for age and sex, Black individuals had over a 4-fold increased risk of COVID-19 infection (odds ratio; 95% confidence interval: 4.32; 3.00-6.23), and there was a doubling of risk in the Asian group (2.12; 1.37, 3.28) and the 'other' non-white group (1.84; 1.13, 2.99). After controlling for potential explanatory factors which included neighbourhood deprivation, household crowding, smoking, body size, inflammation, glycated haemoglobin, and mental illness, these effect estimates were attenuated by 33% for Blacks, 52% for Asians and 43% for Other, but remained raised for Blacks (2.66; 1.82, 3.91), Asian (1.43; 0.91, 2.26) and other non-white groups (1.41; 0.87, 2.31). CONCLUSIONS: There were clear ethnic differences in risk of COVID-19 hospitalisation and these do not appear to be fully explained by measured factors.

522829,Virtual Health Literacy–An Answer in a Time of Pandemic,2021,"The non-structural protein (nsp)-3 of SARS-CoV2 coronavirus is sought to be an essential target protein which is also named as papain-like protease (PLpro). This protease cleaves the viral polyprotein, but importantly in human host it also removes ubiquitin-like interferon-stimulated gene 15 protein (ISG15) from interferon responsive factor 3 (IRF3) protein which ultimately downregulates the production of type I interferon leading to weakening of immune response. GRL0617 is the most potent known inhibitor for PLpro that was initially developed for SARS outbreak of 2003. The PLpro of SARS-CoV and CoV2 share 83% sequence identity but interestingly have several identical conserved amino acids that suggests GRL0617 to be an effective inhibitor for PLpro of SARS-CoV2. GRL0617 is a naphthalene-based molecule and interacts with Tyr268 of SARS-CoV2-PLpro (and Tyr269 of SARS-CoV-PLpro). To identify PLpro inhibitors, we prepared a library of secondary metabolites from fungi with aromatic nature and docked them with PLpro of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2. We found six hits which interacts with Tyr268 of SARS-CoV2-PLpro (and Tyr269 of SARS-CoV-PLpro). More surprisingly the top hit, Fonsecin, has naphthalene moiety in its structure, which recruits Tyr268 of SARS-CoV2-PLpro (and Tyr269 of SARS-CoV-PLpro) and has binding energy at par with control (GRL0617). Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation showed Fonsecin to interact with Tyr268 of SARS-CoV2-PLpro more efficiently than control (GRL0617) and interacting with a greater number of amino acids in the binding cleft of PLpro.","Rao, Priyashi; Patel, Rohit; Shukla, Arpit; Parmar, Paritosh; Rawal, Rakesh M; Saraf, Meenu; Goswami, Dweipayan",Mol. divers,,101

This recognition has led to the urgent need for practical guidance regarding prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of VTE. METHODS: A group of approved panelists developed key clinical questions by using the PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome) format that addressed urgent clinical questions regarding the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of VTE in patients with COVID-19. MEDLINE (via PubMed or Ovid), Embase, and Cochrane Controlled Register of Trials were systematically searched for relevant literature, and references were screened for inclusion. Validated evaluation tools were used to grade the level of evidence to support each recommendation. When evidence did not exist, guidance was developed based on consensus using the modified Delphi process. RESULTS: The systematic review and critical analysis of the literature based on 13 Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome questions resulted in 22 statements. Very little evidence exists in the COVID-19 population. The panel thus used expert consensus and existing evidence-based guidelines to craft the guidance statements. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence on the optimal strategies to prevent, diagnose, and treat VTE in patients with COVID-19 is sparse but rapidly evolving.","Moores, Lisa K; Tritschler, Tobias; Brosnahan, Shari; Carrier, Marc; Collen, Jacob F; Doerschug, Kevin; Holley, Aaron B; Jimenez, David; Le Gal, Gregoire; Rali, Parth; Wells, Philip",Chest,,101

STUDY DESIGN: Prospective observational study. SETTING: Single institution across 3 hospital sites during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Patients who were intubated for respiratory wean tracheotomy underwent SARS-CoV-2 PCR nasal, throat, and endotracheal tube swabs at the time of the procedure. These were assessed via quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR. The tracheal tissue excised during the tracheotomy was cultured for SARS-CoV-2 with Vero E6 and Caco2 cells. Serum was assessed for antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2 via neutralization assays. RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients were included in this study. The mean number of days intubated prior to undergoing surgical tracheotomy was 27.8. At the time of the surgical tracheotomy, PCR swab testing yielded 8 positive results, but none of the 35 individuals who underwent tissue culture were positive for SARS-CoV-2. All 18 patients who had serum sampling demonstrated neutralization antibodies, with a minimum titer of 1:80. CONCLUSION: In our series, irrespective of positive PCR swab, the likelihood of infectivity during tracheotomy remains low given negative tracheal tissue cultures. While our results do not undermine national and international guidance on tracheotomy after day 10 of intubation, given the length of time to procedure in our data, infectivity at 10 days cannot be excluded.

We report 16 PAHs measured in ambient PM(2.5) from June 2018 to May 2019 over three different sites located in central east India. The annual average PM(2.5) mass concentrations of 97.3 ± 18.1 µg m(−3), 101.9 ± 19.4 µg m(−3), and 93.9 ± 20.3 µg m(−3) were measured at RCI (Ranchi), GHY (Gamharia), and BKR (Bokaro), respectively. The mass concentrations at all sampling sites are relatively higher than the annual average concentration of the National Ambient Air Quality Standard. Total annual PAH concentrations (ng m(−3)) are found to be comparable at BKR (797.9 ± 39.1 ng m(−3)) and RCI (887.7 ± 38.8 ng m(−3)); however, a relatively higher average is observed over GHY (1015.1 ± 42.7 ng m(−3)). Using PAH diagnostic ratios and principal component analysis (PCA), their major sources were attributed to coal and wood combustion as well as vehicular emission of diesel and gasoline at all sampling sites. Significant seasonal variability is observed for PAH composition and mainly attributed to change in emission sources. Summer and winter compositions were found to be impacted by the transport from Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP). However, ambient level PAHs during the post-monsoon season were impacted by mixed sources from Indo-Gangetic Plain and eastern India. These observations are supported by the analysis of back-trajectory and fire count data. The excess life time cancer risk (ELCR) values estimated for the study sites are within acceptable limits suggesting acceptable risk levels at BKR, GHY, and RCI. This study highlights the significance of ambient aerosol concentration for health risks in the pre-COVID-19 scenario.

In addition to direct antimicrobial activity, these peptides participate in many cellular functions, including chemotaxis, wound healing, and even determination of canine coat colour. Various biologic and genetic approaches have helped to elucidate the role of antimicrobial peptide with respect innate immunity and host defense. Associations of antimicrobial peptides with various skin diseases, including psoriasis, rosacea and atopic dermatitis, have been documented in humans. In the longer term, therapeutic modulation of antimicrobial peptide expression may provide effective new treatments for disease.

The promising pharmacological properties of these plants have paved the way for developing therapy against novel Coronavirus (CoV) infection. The current review will summarize published works of literature on the effects of traditional Indian medicinal plants against acute respiratory infection (COVID‐19, SARS, Influenza, and Respiratory syncytial virus infection) and registered clinical trials of traditional Indian herbal medicines in COVID‐19. The current study aims to comprehensively evaluate the data of traditional Indian medicinal plants to warrant their use in COVID‐19 management. PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases were searched along with different clinical trial databases. A total of 22 relevant traditional Indian medicinal plants (35 relevant studies) were included in the current study having potential antiviral properties against virus‐induced respiratory illness along with promising immunomodulatory and thrombolytic properties. Further, 36 randomized and nonrandomized registered clinical trials were also included that were aimed at evaluating the efficacy of herbal plants or their formulations in COVID‐19 management. The antiviral, immunomodulatory, and thrombolytic activities of the traditional Indian medicinal plants laid down a strong rationale for their use in developing therapies against SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. The study identified some important potential traditional Indian medicinal herbs such as Ocimum tenuiflorum, Tinospora cordifolia, Achyranthes bidentata, Cinnamomum cassia, Cydonia oblonga, Embelin ribes, Justicia adhatoda, Momordica charantia, Withania somnifera, Zingiber officinale, Camphor, and Kabusura kudineer, which could be used in therapeutic strategies against SARS‐CoV‐2 infection.","Singh, Rahul Soloman; Singh, Ashutosh; Kaur, Harpinder; Batra, Gitika; Sarma, Phulen; Kaur, Hardeep; Bhattacharyya, Anusuya; Sharma, Amit Raj; Kumar, Subodh; Upadhyay, Sujata; Tiwari, Vinod; Avti, Pramod; Prakash, Ajay; Medhi, Bikash",Phytother Res,https://doi.org/10.1002/ptr.7150; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34132429/,101

In Tarija department, the peak of cases was registered in the months of July, August and September. The Departmental Hemodialysis Center during this period had 71 registered patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis sessions. In this article we display the prevalence of patients who were infected with COVID-19 during that period of time. METHOD: This is a prospective cohort observational study in which 71 patients were observed, who underwent hemodialysis sessions during the three shifts during the day (morning, afternoon and evening, during the months of July, August and September, months which were the peak of the pandemic in Tarija. Patients suspected of being transmitted with the disease, underwent immunochromatography IgM/IgG, ELISA anti SARS-CoV-2 and RT/PCR tests before confirming the diagnosis of COVID-19. Patients who had hemodialysis sessions for a period of less than 3 months were excluded from the study, and also those who changed their treatment modality for peritoneal dialysis to hemodialysis. RESULTS: 63 patients, 27 men and 36 women, who underwent hemodialysis sessions during the observational period met the inclusion criteria of the study. 7 patients were excluded for not meeting the inclusion criteria, 6 with a period less than 3 months undergoing hemodialysis and 1 patient who had changed the treatment modality from peritoneal dialysis to HD were excluded too. Of the 63 hemodialysis patients, 57 patients remained healthy and 6 were diagnosed with COVID-19 (Table 1). The prevalence of patients who presented COVID-19 in the hemodialysis center was 9%, with 33% of mortality and 83% who were able to recover and receive epidemiological discharge (figure 1). Of the 6 patients who developed COVID-19, 3 were women and 3 were men, 4 patients with previous hepatitis B infection who were dialyzed in the room with machines HBV + and 2 patients without liver infections who were dialyzed in negative machines. Three patients evolved asymptomatic during the SARS-CoV-2 infection, 2 presented thermal rises and mild cough, but without compromise in O2 saturation or ventilatory function, and one patient who died developed mild cough, slight fever and a hemodialysis catheter-related bloodstream infection by Staphylococcus aureus, confirmed in blood culture. Clinical characteristics of study participants (N=63) CONCLUSION: The prevalence of patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 was 9% with a mortality of 17% (1 patient), validating that strict patient control and prevention measures become a great support to avoid massive spread between patient prone to acquire this infectious disease.","Zamora, Nelson; Molina, Andrea; Arduz, Jaime",Nephrol Dial Transplant,https://doi.org/10.1093/ndt/gfab098.0040,101
593861,Equity without human rights: a false COVID-19 narrative?,2021-07-15,"The COVID-19 pandemic has led to countries enforcing the use of facial masks to prevent contagion. However, acquisition, reuse, and disposal of personal protective equipment (PPE) has generated problems, in regard to the safety of individuals and environmental sustainability. Effective strategies to reprocess and disinfect PPE are needed to improve the efficacy and durability of this equipment and to reduce waste load. Thus, the addition of photocatalytic materials to these materials, combined with light exposure at specific wavelengths, may represent promising solutions. To this aim, we prepared a series of masks by depositing micrometer-sized TiO(2) on the external surfaces; the masks were then contaminated with droplets of bacteria suspensions and the coatings were activated by light radiation at different wavelengths. A significant reduction in the microbial load (over 90%, p < 0.01) was observed using both Gram negative (E. coli) and Gram positive (S. aureus) bacteria within 15 min of irradiation, with UV or visible light, including sunlight or artificial sources.

An accurate load prediction of hospital energy consumption is of paramount importance to a successful healthcare building energy management. In this study, eight machine learning models of single learning and ensemble learning were developed for predicting healthcare facilities’ energy consumption. To validate the performance of the proposed model, an experiment was conducted on a general hospital in Shanghai, China. It was found that the two ensemble models, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model and Random Forest (RF) model, outperformed single models in daily electrical load prediction. A further comparison between models trained with daily and weekly temporal resolution electrical data shows that it is more likely to achieve higher accuracy with finer time granularity. Through feature importance analysis, the most influential features under the daily and weekly electrical load prediction were identified. Based on the prediction results, it is expected that hospital facility managers will be able to conveniently assess the expected energy usage of their hospitals with the machine learning models.","Cao, Lingyan; Li, Yongkui; Zhang, Jiansong; Jiang, Yi; Han, Yilong; Wei, Jianjun",Energy Reports,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2352484720313585; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352484720313585,101

One of the current treatment protocols involves the antibiotic azithromycin (AZM) alone or in combination with other compounds. Obtaining additional insight into the charge-transfer (CT) chemistry of this antibiotic could help researchers and clinicians to improve such treatment protocols. Toward this aim, we investigated the CT interactions between AZM and three π-acceptors: picric acid (PA), chloranilic acid (CLA), and chloranil (CHL) in MeOH solvent. AZM formed colored products at a 1:1 stoichiometry with the acceptors through intermolecular hydrogen bonding. An n → π* interaction was also proposed for the AZM-CHL CT product. The synthesized CT products had markedly different morphologies from the free reactants, exhibiting a semi-crystalline structure composed of spherical particles with diameters ranging from 50 to 90 nm.","Adam, Abdel Majid A.; Saad, Hosam A.; Alsuhaibani, Amnah M.; Refat, Moamen S.; Hegab, Mohamed S.",J Mol Liq,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0167732220373633; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33518854/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167732220373633; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molliq.2020.115121,101
597469,The Pro-Health Benefits of Morusin Administration—An Update Review,2021-08-30,"Massive outbreaks of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) recurred in South Korea in 2013–2014 and affected approximately 40% of the swine breeding herds across the country, incurring a tremendous financial impact on producers and consumers. Despite the nationwide use of commercially available attenuated and inactivated vaccines in South Korea, PEDV has continued to plague the domestic pork industry, raising concerns regarding their protective efficacies and the need for new vaccine development. In a previous study, we isolated and serially cultivated a Korean PEDV epidemic strain, KOR/KNU-141112/2014, in Vero cells. With the availability of a cell culture-propagated PEDV strain, we are able to explore vaccination and challenge studies on pigs. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to produce an inactivated PEDV vaccine using the KNU-141112 strain and evaluate its effectiveness in neonatal piglets. Pregnant sows were immunized intramuscularly with the inactivated adjuvanted monovalent vaccine at six and three weeks prior to farrowing. Six-day-old piglets born to vaccinated or unvaccinated sows were challenged with the homogeneous KNU-141112 virus. The administration of the inactivated vaccine to sows greatly increased the survival rate of piglets challenged with the virulent strain, from 0% to approximately 92% (22/24), and significantly reduced diarrhea severity including viral shedding in feces. In addition, litters from unvaccinated sows continued to lose body weight throughout the experiment, whereas litters from vaccinated sows started recovering their daily weight gain at 7 days after the challenge. Furthermore, strong neutralizing antibody responses to PEDV were verified in immunized sows and their offspring, but were absent in the unvaccinated controls. Altogether, our data demonstrated that durable lactogenic immunity was present in dams administrated with the inactivated vaccine and subsequently conferred critical passive immune protection to their own litters against virulent PEDV infection.","Baek, Pil-Soo; Choi, Hwan-Won; Lee, Sunhee; Yoon, In-Joong; Lee, Young Ju; Lee, Du Sik; Lee, Seungyoon; Lee, Changhee",Vet Immunol Immunopathol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27185262/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165242716300666; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2016.04.009; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165242716300666,101
600066,Global responses of health science librarians to the COVID‐19 (Corona virus) pandemic: a desktop analysis,2020-07-09,"The global demand for sustainable energy is increasing due to urbanization, industrialization, population, and developmental growth. Transforming the large quantities of biomass resources such as agro-residues/wastes could raise the energy supply and promote energy mix. Residues of biomass instituted in the rural and industrial centers are enormous, and poor management of these residues results in several indescribable environmental threats. The energy potential of these residues can provide job opportunities and income for nations. The generation and utilization of dissimilar biomass as feedstock for energy production via densification could advance the diversity of energy crops. An increase in renewable and clean energy demand will likely increase the request for biomass residues for renewable energy generation via densification. This will reduce the environmental challenges associated with burning and dumping of these residues in an open field. Densification is the process of compacting particles together through the application of pressure to form solid fuels. Marketable densification is usually carried out using conventional pressure-driven processes such as extrusion, screw press, piston type, hydraulic piston press, roller press, and pallet press (ring and flat die). Based on compaction, densification methods can be categorized into high-pressure, medium-pressure, and low-pressure compactions. The common densification processes are briquetting, pelletizing, bailing, and cubing. They manufacture solid fuel with desirable fuel characteristics—physical, mechanical, chemical, thermal, and combustion characteristics. Fuel briquettes and pellets have numerous advantages and applications both in domestic and industrial settings. However, for biomass to be rationally and efficiently utilized as solid fuel, it must be characterized to determine its fuel properties.

This study aims to (A) describe the clinical phenotype of post-COVID symptomatology in children and young people (CYP) with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with test-negative controls, (B) produce an operational definition of Long COVID in CYP, and (C) establish its prevalence in CYP. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A cohort study of SARS-CoV-2-positive CYP aged 11–17 years compared with age, sex and geographically matched SARS-CoV-2 test-negative CYP. CYP aged 11–17 testing positive and negative for SARS-CoV-2 infection will be identified and contacted 3, 6, 12 and 24 months after the test date. Consenting CYP will complete an online questionnaire. We initially planned to recruit 3000 test positives and 3000 test negatives but have since extended our target. Data visualisation techniques will be used to examine trajectories over time for symptoms and variables measured repeatedly, separately by original test status. Summary measures of fatigue and mental health dimensions will be generated using dimension reduction methods such as latent variables/latent class/principal component analysis methods. Cross-tabulation of collected and derived variables against test status and discriminant analysis will help operationalise preliminary definitions of Long COVID.

METHOD: Death records were obtained from the Municipal Register of inhabitants (Municipal Statistics Service). Based on Chiang II method, life expectancy at birth and at 65 years of age (LEB and LE65) were calculated, as well as their 95% confidence intervals both for men and women and their gross, net and minimum falls for each district in 2020 over 2019, their correlation with some socioeconomic variables distribution and the existence of multiple linear regression explicative models. RESULTS: In 2020, deaths in Madrid increased by 46.1% compared with the previous year, the LEB was 79.31 years in men and 85.25 years in women, meaning a decrease of 3.67 and 2.56 years respectively (4.42% and 2.91%). All districts registered decreases in LE, with the largest decrease in men in Tetuan (4.72 years) and in women in Chamartín (3.91 years). The most affected were the southern districts, especially in men. Immigrant and people over 80 years old rates explained 24% of the drop in LE in men, using linear regression model. CONCLUSIONS: The decrease in LE recorded in Madrid and its districts in 2020 is bigger than in Spain (1.6 years), takes us back to values of 2002 (LE65) and 2008 (LEB), has a sharper fall in the south and is territorially unequally distributed, according to socioeconomic variables and being associated with some of them.","Díaz-Olalla, José Manuel; Valero-Oteo, Irene; Moreno-Vázquez, Silvia; Blasco-Novalbos, Gema; Del Moral-Luque, Juan Antonio; Haro-León, Agustín","Gac. sanit.

Remarkably, COVID-19 has rapidly spread across all continents and turned into a public health emergency, which was ultimately declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) in early 2020. SARS-CoV-2 presents similar aspects to other members of the coronavirus family, mainly regarding its genome, protein structure and intracellular mechanisms, that may translate into mild (or even asymptomatic) to severe infectious conditions. Although the mechanistic features underlying the COVID-19 progression have not been fully clarified, current evidence have suggested that SARS-CoV-2 may primarily behave as other β-coronavirus members. To better understand the development and transmission of COVID-19, unveiling the signaling pathways that may be impacted by SARS-CoV-2 infection, at the molecular and cellular levels, is of crucial importance. In this review, we present the main aspects related to the origin, classification, etiology and clinical impact of SARS-CoV-2. Specifically, here we describe the potential mechanisms of cellular interaction and signaling pathways, elicited by functional receptors, in major targeted tissues/organs from the respiratory, gastrointestinal (GI), cardiovascular, renal, and nervous systems. Furthermore, the potential involvement of these signaling pathways in evoking the onset and progression of COVID-19 symptoms in these organ systems are presently discussed.

Participating veterinarians enrolled 831 dairy herds and submitted fecal samples from 2,565 female dairy cattle for Salmonella culture because of suspicion of clinical disease. Estimates of animal-level incidence rates were calculated for each age group as the number of cases per animal time at risk, and an estimate of herd-level incidence rate was calculated as the number of positive herds per herd time at risk. Descriptive analysis of serotype data and level of antimicrobial resistance was performed, and Poisson regression analysis was used to study associations between the within-herd incidence of salmonellosis and certain predictor variables (herd size, housing type, vaccination status, and prior history of Salmonella infection). Salmonella was isolated from 576 (22.5%) samples representing 93 herds. The animal-level incidence rates for preweaned female calves, heifers, and adult cows were 8.1, 0.04, and 1.8 cases per 1,000 animal-years, respectively. The herd-level incidence rate was 8.6 positive herds per 100 herd-years. Salmonella Newport was the predominant serotype, accounting for 41% of the cases, followed by Salmonella Typhimurium. Over 68% of all isolates were resistant to 5 or more antimicrobial agents. Herd size was the only significant predictor of the incidence of salmonellosis in a multivariable model; herds with at least 400 female dairy cattle had a higher incidence rate than smaller herds. Our results shed light on the impact of salmonellosis on the dairy industry in the northeastern United States, and they help clarify the role of dairy cattle as a source of Salmonella serotypes that are also important human pathogens.","Cummings, K.J.; Warnick, L.D.; Alexander, K.A.; Cripps, C.J.; Gröhn, Y.T.; McDonough, P.L.; Nydam, D.V.; Reed, K.E.",J Dairy Sci,https://doi.org/10.3168/jds.2009-2093; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022030209706988; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19620658/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022030209706988,101

This study aimed to provide data on fatty acid profiles and ratios of Lebanese composite dishes, Arabic sweets, and market foods. Methods: Thirty types of traditional dishes, collected from five different Lebanese governorates, thirty-seven types of Arabic sweets and forty-six market food products were considered for analysis. Food samples were chemically analyzed for total, unsaturated and saturated fatty acids. The range of total fatty acids in composite dishes, Arabic sweets, and market food products was between 1.2–11.7 g/100 g, 5.3–25.8 g/100 g, and 0.5–100 g/100 g, respectively. Additionally, the range of saturated fatty acids in composite dishes, Arabic sweets, and market food products was between 0.5–4.9 g/100 g, 2.5–23.6 g/100 g and 0.1–56.4 g/100 g, respectively. Furthermore, about 75% of these foods were poor in unsaturated fatty acids. Regarding saturated fatty acid, the polyunsaturated to monounsaturated (P.M.S) ratio was lower than the recommended ratio of 1:1:1 in 96% of samples. To conclude, there is a need to prioritize fat content in foods and consider processing modifications in the food production system with the aim of achieving a higher P:M:S ratio intake among the population.","Hoteit, Maha; Zoghbi, Edwina; Rady, Alissar; Shankiti, Iman; Al-Jawaldeh, Ayoub",Nutrients,https://doi.org/10.3390/nu13072462; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34371969/,101
601742,Assessing COVID-19 through the lens of health systems’ preparedness: time for a change,2020-11-19,"BACKGROUND: We generated a mouse model of primary microglial dysfunction by deleting two negative immune regulatory genes, Cx3cr1 and Socs3 (in LysM(+) cells). This study aimed to understand how primary microglial dysfunction impacts retinal neurons during aging. METHODS: The LysMCre-Socs3(fl/fl)Cx3cr1(gfp/gfp) double knockout (DKO), LysMCre-Socs3(fl/fl), Cx3cr1(gfp/gfp) and Socs3(fl/fl) mice were maintained up to 12 months. Eyes were collected and processed for immunohistochemistry of IBA-1, cone arrestin, secretagogin, PKCα and GABA. Brain microglia from DKO and WT mice were stimulated with LPS + IFN-γ or IL-4. The expression of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, iNOS, IL-12p40, IL-23p19, CCL2, CCL5, CXCL2, IL-10, CD206 and Arg1 were examined by qRT-PCR and protein production was measured by Luminex assay. Retinal explants from C57BL/6 J mice were co-cultured with microglia from DKO or WT mice for 24 h, after which the number of cone arrestin(+) cells in retinal flatmount were quantified. RESULTS: In 3–5 month old mice, the number of microglia in retinal ganglion cell layer (GCL) and inner plexiform layer (IPL) were comparable in all strains of mice. The DKO mice had a significantly higher number of microglia in the outer plexiform layer (OPL) but significantly lower numbers of cone arrestin(+), secretagogin(+) and GABA(+) cells compared to Socs3(fl/fl) and single KO mice. During aging, 57% of the DKO mice died before 12 months old. The 10–12 months old DKO mice had significantly higher numbers of microglia in GCL/IPL and OPL than age-matched Socs3(fl/fl) and single KO mice. The aged DKO mice developed retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) dysmorphology accompanied by subretinal microglial accumulation. The number of photoreceptors, bipolar cells (Secretagogin(+) or PKCα(+)) and GABA(+) amacrine cells was significantly lower in aged DKO mice compared to age-matched Socs3(fl/fl) and single KO mice. Microglia from DKO mice showed significantly higher levels of phagocytic activity and produced higher levels of TNF-α, IL-6, CCL2, CCL5, CXCL2 and CXCL10 compared to microglia from Socs3(fl/fl) mice. Co-culture of retinal explants with LPS + IFN-γ or IL-4 pre-treated DKO microglia significantly reduced cone photoreceptor survival. CONCLUSIONS: The LysMCre-Socs3(fl/fl)Cx3cr1(gfp/gfp) DKO mice displayed primary microglial dysfunction and developed age-related retinal microgliopathy characterized by aggragated microglial activation and multiple retinal neuronal and RPE degeneration.

To address this pandemic broad testing with an easy, comfortable and reliable testing method is of utmost concern. The nasopharyngeal (NP) swab sampling is the reference method though hampered by international supply shortages. A new oropharyngeal/nasal (OP/N) sampling method was investigated using the more readily available throat swab. Methods: In this prospective observational study 36 COVID-19 patients were tested with both a NP and combined OP/N swab for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by PCR. In hospitalized suspect patients, who tested negative on both swabs, extensive retesting was performed. The sensitivity of NP versus combined OP/N swab sampling on admission and the correlation between viral RNA loads recovered was investigated. Results: 35 patients were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 by means of either NP or OP/N sampling. The paired swabs were both positive in 31 patients. The one patient who tested negative on both NP and OP/N swab on admission, was ultimately diagnosed on bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. A strong correlation was found between the viral RNA loads of the paired swabs (r = 0.76; P < 0.05). The sensitivity of NP and OP/N analysis in hospitalized patients (n = 28) was 89.3% and 92.7% respectively. Conclusions: This study demonstrates equivalence of NP and OP/N sampling for detection of SARS-CoV-2 by means of rRT-PCR. Sensitivity of both NP and OP/N sampling is very high in hospitalized patients.","Desmet, T.; De Paepe, P.; Boelens, J.; Coorevits, L.; Padalko, E.; Vandendriessche, S.; Leroux-Roels, I.; Aerssens, A.; Callens, S.; Van Braeckel, E.; Malfait, T.; Vermassen, F.; Verhasselt, B.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.06.05.20123745v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.05.20123745,101

The results of an empirical analysis, based on the data of 327 employees, show that job insecurity has a significant negative impact on employees’ extra-role behavior. Negative emotion plays a mediating role in the relationship between job insecurity and extra-role behavior. Workplace friendship moderated the relationship between job insecurity and negative emotions, as well as between job insecurity and extra-role behavior. Workplace friendship also moderates the mediating effect of negative emotion on the relationship between job insecurity and extra-role behavior, that is, the higher the level of the workplace friendship is, the weaker the mediation role mentioned above will be.

605374,The Capacity of the Indonesian Healthcare System to Respond to COVID-19,2021-07-07,"The social, economic and political consequences of emerging infectious disease (EID) may escape the sphere in which they first arise. In recent years, many EIDs have revealed the close links between human, animal and plant health, highlighting the need for multi-scale, multisectorial EID management. Human beings play a dual role in EID because they can promote their development through numerous human-environment interfaces and expanding international trade. On the other hand, their ability to analyze, interpret and act on the determinants of EID allows them to access the expertise necessary to control these EIDs. This expertise must be constantly adapted to remain relevant as the EID evolves, particularly in its virulence or transmission channels. Flexibility should become an inherent part of the expertise-based decision-making process even if it means going backwards. A certain degree of transparency and feedback to citizens is necessary for the acceptability of political decisions basing on expertise. A key step in the management of EID is the appropriate management of the early signal of infectious emergence. This step combines multidisciplinary skills allowing access to the best pathway for containing EID by implementing early countermeasures adapted to the situation. New digital technologies could significantly improve this early detection phase. Finally, experts have a fundamental role to play because they are located at the interface between operational actors and decision-makers, which allows multidirectional feedback, ideally in real time, between professional actors and decision makers. To combat current and future EIDs, expertise should be based on a multi-sectorial approach, promotion of collegiality and continuously adaptation to the evolving nature of EIDs.","Le Turnier, P.; Leport, C.; Martin, P.; Jadand, C.; Hoen, B.; Guégan, J.-F.",Rev Epidemiol Sante Publique,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.respe.2019.09.009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31862272/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0398762019305206; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0398762019305206,101

However, little work has been done to determine the optimal level of investment in contact tracing. In this paper, we present a methodology for evaluating the appropriate level of investment in contact tracing. We develop and apply a simulation model of contact tracing and the spread of an infectious disease among a network of individuals in order to evaluate the cost and effectiveness of different levels of contact tracing. We show that contact tracing is likely to have diminishing returns to scale in investment: incremental investments in contact tracing yield diminishing reductions in disease prevalence. In conjunction with a cost-effectiveness threshold, we then determine the optimal amount that should be invested in contact tracing. We first assume that the only incremental disease control is contact tracing. We then extend the analysis to consider the optimal allocation of a budget between contact tracing and screening for exogenous infection, and between contact tracing and screening for endogenous infection. We discuss how a simulation model of this type, appropriately tailored, could be used as a policy tool for determining the appropriate level of investment in contact tracing for a specific disease in a specific population. We present an example application to contact tracing for chlamydia control.","Armbruster, Benjamin; Brandeau, Margaret L.",Health Care Manag Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18074967/,101

Thus, investments in and expenditures on healthcare (and most other things) vary with age and a variety of other factors, including whether one lives in a rural area, suburb, or central city, health risks, risk aversion, and beliefs about the nature of a good life. Because assessment of the effects of illnesses vary with the same factors, the conclusions reached about best private and governmental health policies also tend to vary.

While well established as the most common viral infections associated with exacerbations of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, RVs and other respiratory viruses are also now thought to be important in triggering exacerbations of cystic fibrosis and the interstitial lung diseases. Here, we summarize the epidemiological evidence the supports respiratory viruses including RV as triggers of exacerbations of chronic lung diseases. We propose that certain characteristics of RVs may explain why they are the most common trigger of exacerbations of chronic lung diseases. We further highlight the latest mechanistic evidence supporting how and why common respiratory viral infections may enhance and promote disease triggering exacerbation events, through their interactions with the host immune system, and may be affected by ongoing treatments. We also provide a commentary on how new treatments may better manage the disease burden associated with respiratory viral infections and the exacerbation events that they trigger.","Edwards, Michael R.; Ritchie, Andrew I.; Johnston, Sebastian L.",Rhinovirus Infections,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128164174000068; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128164174000068,101
609022,The global governance of pandemics,2021-07-19,"Abstract In the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis, locally produced antibodies complex with an inciting antigen, yet to be identified, within the joint and activate the complement system, resulting in articular inflammation mediated primarily by polymorphonuclear leukocytes and their products. Chronic inflammatory cells then produce soluble factors that induce both tissue destruction and inflammation. A major issue is how and why apparently normal immune responses in the acute stage progress to chronic inflammation in subsequent months to years. Although it is often assumed that the initial etiologic agent, persisting in the joint or at an extra-articular site, is responsible for continued synovitis, this need not be the case. It is possible that once the inciting agent is cleared from the joint through a normal immune response, the presence of activated cells rich in surface class II histocompatibility (Ia) antigens could, under the influence of multiple genetic or environmental factors, become the target of autoimmune attack. Alternatively, the process might result from the interactions of synovial lining cells and their products with T cells assuming a secondary role. Further research into the relative contributions of soluble products, T helper and suppressor subsets, synoviocytes, and antigen determine which model is correct.","Zvaifler, Nathan J.",The American Journal of Medicine,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0002934388903567; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3052052/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0002934388903567,101

Mechanisms of the post-vaccination immune response were not investigated. This study involved 41 patients aged 7-15 years who were treated for solid tumors two or more years ago. Of these, 26 were vaccinated against diphtheria and tetanus with ADS-m toxoid. Fifteen children (i.e., controls) were not vaccinated. The vaccination tolerability and clinical characteristics of the underlying disease remission ware assessed. Lymphocyte subpopulations were investigated over time by flow cytometry at 1, 6, and 12 months. IgG anti-diphtheria and anti-tetanus toxoids levels were assessed by ELISA. Within the first day of the post-vaccination period, two (7.7%) children demonstrated moderate local reactions and increased body temperature (up to 38.0°C). Relapse and metastasis were not mentioned within a year after immunization. An increase in concentration of IgG antibodies, maintained for 12 months, were noted [2.1 (1.3-3.4) IU/ml against diphtheria (p <0.001), 6.4 (2.3-9.7) IU/ml against tetanus (p <0.001)]. In contrast to healthy children, those with a history of cancer demonstrated a decrease in the relative number of mature T lymphocytes, as well as in absolute number of cytotoxic T cells and B lymphocytes. In a month after the revaccination, a significant increase in absolute (p = 0.04) and relative (p = 0.007) numbers of T lymphocytes and T helpers was revealed. In a year, these values decreased to baseline levels. As for helpers, they decreased below baseline and control values (p = 0.004). In a year after the vaccination, there was a significant (p = 0.05) increase in lymphocyte level with a decrease in the number of NK cells and B cells as compared with controls. Revaccination against diphtheria and tetanus promoted proliferation of a total lymphocytic cell pool along with restoration of the T lymphocyte subpopulation in children with a history of solid tumors. The ADS-m toxoid has a certain nonspecific immunomodulatory effect. These findings are important, also in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic.","Kostinov, Mikhail Petrovich; Akhmatova, Nelli Kimovna; Karpocheva, Svetlana Victorovna; Vlasenko, Anna Egorovna; Polishchuk, Valentina Borisovna; Kostinov, Anton Mikhailovich",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34305933/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.696816,101

610639,We Need Compassionate Leadership Management Based on Evidence to Defeat COVID-19,2020-05-10,"BACKGROUND: Exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months of life is the optimal way to feed infants. However, recent studies suggest that exclusive breastfeeding rates in China remain low and are well below the recommended target. There has been evidence that a lack of awareness of, or exposure to, breastfeeding information is associated with poor breastfeeding practices. WeChat, the most widely used social networking platform in China, has shown some potential to promote health behaviours. We thus hypothesised that a breastfeeding intervention program delivered via WeChat would achieve at least a 10% increase in exclusive breastfeeding prevalence at 6 months compared to the control group. METHODS: A two-arm, parallel, multicentre randomised controlled trial of 1000 pregnant women will be conducted at four maternity hospitals of Chengdu, China. Eligible women who consent to participate in the trial will be recruited at 28–30 weeks of gestation, and randomly allocated to either the intervention group (participants receive breastfeeding-related information from WeChat) or the control group (participants receive non-breastfeeding information from WeChat) using a central randomisation system on a 1:1 ratio at each participating site. The primary outcomes are exclusive breastfeeding rate and full breastfeeding rate at 6 months postpartum. All randomised participants will be included in the outcome analyses with missing data being imputed based on the best-case and worst-case scenarios. Multilevel mixed regression models will be used in the primary analyses to assess the effectiveness of intervention program on the breastfeeding rates. DISCUSSION: This trial uses the most widely used social media program as a means of delivering messages to mothers to increase exclusive breastfeeding in China. Increasing exclusive breastfeeding will contribute to meeting the health and environmental goals of the Sustainable Development Guidelines. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04499404.

Underlying CHB was associated with a lower SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate, after adjusting for comorbidities (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.65; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.57–0.74). Among patients with confirmed COVID-19, underlying CHB tended to confer a 66% greater risk of severe clinical outcomes of COVID-19, although this value was statistically insignificant. Antiviral treatment including tenofovir and entecavir was associated with a reduced SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate (aOR 0.49; 95% CI, 0.37–0.66), while treatment was not associated with severe clinical outcomes of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Underlying CHB and antiviral agents including tenofovir decreased susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. HBV coinfection did not increase the risk of disease severity or lead to a worse prognosis in COVID-19.","Kang, Seong Hee; Cho, Dong-Hyuk; Choi, Jimi; Baik, Soon Koo; Gwon, Jun Gyo; Kim, Moon Young",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0258229; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34610052/,101
611174,Trade and Health: Is the Health Community Ready for Action?,2005-01-25,"Agent based models (ABMs) are a useful tool for modeling spatio-temporal population dynamics, where many details can be included in the model description. Their computational cost though is very high and for stochastic ABMs a lot of individual simulations are required to sample quantities of interest. Especially, large numbers of agents render the sampling infeasible. Model reduction to a metapopulation model leads to a significant gain in computational efficiency, while preserving important dynamical properties. Based on a precise mathematical description of spatio-temporal ABMs, we present two different metapopulation approaches (stochastic and piecewise deterministic) and discuss the approximation steps between the different models within this framework. Especially, we show how the stochastic metapopulation model results from a Galerkin projection of the underlying ABM onto a finite-dimensional ansatz space. Finally, we utilize our modeling framework to provide a conceptual model for the spreading of COVID-19 that can be scaled to real-world scenarios.","Winkelmann, Stefanie; Zonker, Johannes; Schütte, Christof; Conrad, Nataša Djurdjevac",Math Biosci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33887314/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mbs.2021.108619; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0025556421000614; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025556421000614?v=s5,101

In this paper, we present a data-informed approach for building stochastic compartmental models that is grounded in the Markovian processes underlying these models. Our initial data analyses reveal that the SIRD model -- susceptiple (S), infected (I), recovered (R), and death (D) -- is not consistent with the data. In particular, the transition times expressed in the dataset do not obey exponential distributions, implying that there exist unmodeled (hidden) states. We make use of the available epidemiological data to inform the location of these hidden states, allowing us to develop an augmented compartmental model which includes states for hospitalization (H) and end of infectious viral shedding (V). Using the proposed model, we characterize delay distributions analytically and match model parameters to empirical quantities in the data to obtain a good model fit. Insights from an epidemiological perspective are presented, as well as their implications for mitigation and control strategies.","Olmez, S. Y.; Mori, J.; Miehling, E.; Basar, T.; Smith, R.

We aim to estimate the association and exposure-outcome effects between exposure to nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)) and influenza prevalence in a mountainous region with a dense population and high humidity. We investigated 14,993 patients with confirmed influenza cases from January 2013 to December 2017 in Chongqing, a mountainous city in southwest China. We developed distributed lag non-linear models with quasi-Poisson link to take into account the lag and non-linear effects of NO(2) exposure on influenza prevalence. We estimated that the cumulative effect of a 10 μg/m(3) increase in NO(2) with seven-day lag (i.e., summing all the contributions up to seven days) corresponded to relative risk of 1.24 (95% CI: 1.17-1.31) in daily influenza prevalence. Comparing to annual mean of the World Health Organization air quality guidelines of 40 μg/m(3) for NO(2), we estimated that 14.01% (95% CI: 10.69-17.08%) of the influenza cases were attributable to excessive NO(2) exposure. Our results suggest that NO(2) exposure could worsen the risk of influenza infection in this mountainous city, filling the gap of relevant researches in densely populated and mountainous cities. Our findings provide evidence for developing influenza surveillance and early warning systems.","Zeng, Wen; Zhao, Han; Liu, Rui; Yan, Wei; Qiu, Yang; Yang, Fumo; Shu, Chang; Zhan, Yu",Environ Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32980014/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0013935120308215; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2020.109926; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935120308215?v=s5,101

The study utilised a qualitative design with inductive analysis approach. Seven key health policy decisions-makers within Australia were interviewed. Practical strategies identified to support provision and delivery of foot care in primary care were: (a) building on current incentivisation structures through quality improvement projects; (b) enhancing education and community awareness; (c) greater utilisation and provision of resources and support systems; and (d) development of collaborative models of care and referral pathways. Key elements reported to support effective implementation of footcare strategies included developing and implementing strategies based on co-design, consultation, collaboration, consolidation and co-commissioning. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first Australian study to obtain information from key health policy decision-makers, identifying strategies to support footcare delivery in primary care. Implementation of preventative diabetes-related footcare strategies into 'routine' primary care clinical practice requires multiparty co-design, consultation, consolidation, collaboration and co-commissioning. The basis of strategy development will influence implementation success and thus improve outcomes for people living with diabetes.","Mullan, Leanne; Wynter, Karen; Driscoll, Andrea; Rasmussen, Bodil",Aust J Prim Health,https://doi.org/10.1071/py20241; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34229831/,101

Discordant findings of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in air samples were noted in early reports. METHODS: Sampling of air close to 6 asymptomatic and symptomatic COVID-19 patients with and without surgical masks was performed with sampling devices using sterile gelatin filters. Frequently touched environmental surfaces near 21 patients were swabbed before daily environmental disinfection. The correlation between the viral loads of patients’ clinical samples and environmental samples was analyzed. RESULTS: All air samples were negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the 6 patients singly isolated inside airborne infection isolation rooms (AIIRs) with 12 air changes per hour. Of 377 environmental samples near 21 patients, 19 (5.0%) were positive by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay, with a median viral load of 9.2 × 10(2) copies/mL (range, 1.1 × 10(2) to 9.4 × 10(4) copies/mL). The contamination rate was highest on patients’ mobile phones (6 of 77, 7.8%), followed by bed rails (4 of 74, 5.4%) and toilet door handles (4 of 76, 5.3%). We detected a significant correlation between viral load ranges in clinical samples and positivity rate of environmental samples (P < .001). CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 RNA was not detectable by air samplers, which suggests that the airborne route is not the predominant mode of transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Wearing a surgical mask, appropriate hand hygiene, and thorough environmental disinfection are sufficient infection control measures for COVID-19 patients isolated singly in AIIRs. However, this conclusion may not apply during aerosol-generating procedures or in cohort wards with large numbers of COVID-19 patients.","Cheng, Vincent Chi-Chung; Wong, Shuk-Ching; Chan, Veronica Wing-Man; So, Simon Yung-Chun; Chen, Jonathan Hon-Kwan; Yip, Cyril Chik-Yan; Chan, Kwok-Hung; Chu, Hin; Chung, Tom Wai-Hin; Sridhar, Siddharth; To, Kelvin Kai-Wang; Chan, Jasper Fuk-Woo; Hung, Ivan Fan-Ngai; Ho, Pak-Leung; Yuen, Kwok-Yung",Infection control and hospital epidemiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32507114/; https://doi.org/10.1017/ice.2020.282,101

Targeted treatment of infectious diseases requires precision diagnostics, especially in cases where broad-range therapeutics such as antibiotics fail. There is thus an increasing need for new approaches to develop sensitive and specific in vitro diagnostic (IVD) tests. Basic science and translational research are needed to identify key microbial molecules as diagnostic targets, to identify relevant host counterparts, and to use this knowledge in developing or improving IVD. In this regard, an overlooked feature is the capacity of pathogens to adhere specifically to host cells and tissues. The molecular entities relevant for pathogen–surface interaction are the so-called adhesins. Adhesins vary from protein compounds to (poly-)saccharides or lipid structures that interact with eukaryotic host cell matrix molecules and receptors. Such interactions co-define the specificity and sensitivity of a diagnostic test. Currently, adhesin-receptor binding is typically used in the pre-analytical phase of IVD tests, focusing on pathogen enrichment. Further exploration of adhesin–ligand interaction, supported by present high-throughput “omics” technologies, might stimulate a new generation of broadly applicable pathogen detection and characterization tools. This review describes recent results of novel structure-defining technologies allowing for detailed molecular analysis of adhesins, their receptors and complexes. Since the host ligands evolve slowly, the corresponding adhesin interaction is under selective pressure to maintain a constant receptor binding domain. IVD should exploit such conserved binding sites and, in particular, use the human ligand to enrich the pathogen. We provide an inventory of methods based on adhesion factors and pathogen attachment mechanisms, which can also be of relevance to currently emerging pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19.","van Belkum, Alex; Almeida, Carina; Bardiaux, Benjamin; Barrass, Sarah V.; Butcher, Sarah J.; Çaykara, Tuğçe; Chowdhury, Sounak; Datar, Rucha; Eastwood, Ian; Goldman, Adrian; Goyal, Manisha; Happonen, Lotta; Izadi-Pruneyre, Nadia; Jacobsen, Theis; Johnson, Pirjo H.; Kempf, Volkhard A.

Its activity allows for the acidification of intracellular vesicles and organelles, which is necessary for many essential cell biological events to occur. In addition, many specialized cell types in various organ systems such as the kidney, bone, male reproductive tract, inner ear, olfactory mucosa, and more, use plasma membrane V-ATPases to perform specific activities that depend on extracellular acidification. It is, however, increasingly apparent that V-ATPases are central players in many normal and pathophysiological processes that directly influence human health in many different and sometimes unexpected ways. These include cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, diabetes, and sensory perception, as well as energy and nutrient-sensing functions within cells. This review first covers the well-established role of the V-ATPase as a transmembrane proton pump in the plasma membrane and intracellular vesicles and outlines factors contributing to its physiological regulation in different cell types. This is followed by a discussion of the more recently emerging unconventional roles for the V-ATPase, such as its role as a protein interaction hub involved in cell signaling, and the (patho)physiological implications of these interactions. Finally, the central importance of endosomal acidification and V-ATPase activity on viral infection will be discussed in the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic.","Eaton, Amity F.; Merkulova, Maria; Brown, Dennis",Am J Physiol Cell Physiol,https://doi.org/10.1152/ajpcell.00442.2020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33326313/,101

AIM: The objective of this review was to synthesize existing data on the effectiveness and safety of using chemical disinfectants to decontaminate N95 FFRs. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review on disinfectants to decontaminate N95 FFRs using Embase, Medline, Global Health, Google Scholar, WHO feed, and MedRxiv. Two reviewers independently determined study eligibility and extracted predefined data fields. Original research reporting on N95 FFR function, decontamination, safety, or FFR fit following decontamination with a disinfectant was included. FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS: A single cycle of vaporized hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) successfully removes viral pathogens without affecting airflow resistance or fit, and maintains an initial filter penetration of <5%, with little change in FFR appearance. Residual hydrogen peroxide levels following decontamination were within safe limits. More than one decontamination cycle of vaporized H(2)O(2) may be possible but further information is required on how multiple cycles would affect FFR fit in a real world setting before the upper limit can be established. Although immersion in liquid H(2)O(2) does not appear to adversely affect FFR function, there is no available data on its ability to remove infectious pathogens from FFRs or its impact on FFR fit.

During the pandemic, from mid-March to July 2020, around one-fourth of the US population filed for unemployment benefits. Objective: In this article, we discuss the economic ramifications exposed in the American healthcare system’s current model by the COVID-19 crisis. Methods: In this review, we analyze 18 articles to look at how access to health insurance has affected how Americans receive medical care during the coronavirus pandemic. Results: The large-scale job losses related to the pandemic translates directly into millions of Americans also losing employer-sponsored health insurance (ESI) coverage. With the pandemic disproportionately affecting minority populations, these communities now bear the additional toll of not receiving appropriate care. Conclusion: Due to the pandemic, it is probable that a significant portion of Americans that are uninsured are less likely to seek medical care for COVID-19 symptoms. While the disease can manifest as a mild respiratory illness in most, others can experience more severe disease and require acute, intensive medical care. The lack of health insurance in this instance can be potentially fatal. Given that COVID-19 has disproportionately affected minority communities across the USA, it is important to highlight the correlation between access to medical care and COVID-19 infection rates. Communities that are of lower socioeconomic status are less likely to have health insurance and follow up with medical care due to out-of-pocket costs, which in turn leads to a higher case fatality rate due to COVID-19.","Ramgobin, Devyani; McClafferty, Brendan; Kramer, Courtney; Golamari, Reshma; McGillen, Brian; Jain, Rohit",Journal of community hospital internal medicine perspectives,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33552430/; https://doi.org/10.1080/20009666.2020.1851869,101

This is translational research of Tawazon-DPP in which we evaluate the efficacy of the intensive lifestyle modification program. METHODS: Tawazon was piloted in 2 phases over 6 and 9 months at a Tertiary Hospital. Phase I was conducted in 2017 in one district facility with 47 participants while Phase II was conducted in 2018 in 4 district facilities with 247 participants. Data are collected retrospectively in a before-and-after study design. The program included adults with 25 kg/m(2) BMI and HbA1c ranging between 5.7 and 6.4 mmol/L, while excluding participants with comorbidities, such as cardiovascular conditions, musculoskeletal injuries, and pregnancy. RESULTS: We used descriptive analysis as well as Wilcoxon rank sign test and McNemar-Bowker for before and after data comparisons. Phase I exhibited a mean age of 43±7 years and statistically significant improvement in HbA1c (0.3 mmol/L), weight (3.3 kg), BMI (1 kg/m(2)), triglyceride (30.4 mg/dL) and LDL (14.67 mg/dL).

Of single infections, the most common viruses were influenza A in 304 (59·4%) samples of which 275 (90·5%) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, and enterovirus/rhinovirus in 149 (29·1%) samples. The most common co‐infections were influenza A and respiratory syncytial virus B, and influenza A and enterovirus/rhinovirus. In multinomial logistic regression analyses adjusted for age, sex, comorbidity, and timeliness of sample collection, single infection was less often detected in the elderly and co‐infection more often in patients <30 years of age. Co‐infection, but not single infection, was more likely detected in patients who had a sample collected within 2 days of symptom onset as compared to 3–7 days. Conclusions Respiratory viral co‐infections are commonly detected when using molecular techniques. Early sample collection increases likelihood of detection of co‐infection. Further studies are needed to better understand the clinical significance of viral co‐infection.","Peci, Adriana; Winter, Anne‐Luise; Gubbay, Jonathan B.; Skowronski, Danuta M.; Balogun, Elizabeth I.; De Lima, Cedric; Crowcroft, Natasha S.; Rebbapragada, Anu",Influenza Other Respir Viruses,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1750-2659.2012.00418.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22883216/,101

Some studies indicate that SARSCoV- 2 infection may be associated with a higher risk of adverse outcomes in pregnant women. Here, we performed a meta-analysis to estimate the frequency of intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and preterm premature rupture of the membranes (PPROM) in pregnant women with Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). A comprehensive search was performed in various databases, such as PubMed, Scopus, SciELO, MedRxiv, and Web of Science, to find all relevant studies published before 10 February 2021. Cross-sectional and consecutive case series reporting the pregnancy outcomes of COVID-19 were included. A total of 24 studies, including 8 studies on IUGR and 16 studies on PPROM, were selected. Pooled data showed that the frequencies of IUGR and PPROM in pregnant women with COVID-19 were 2.6% and 9.9%, respectively. Analyses stratified by ethnicity showed that the frequencies of IUGR in Asian and Caucasian COVID-19-infected pregnant women were 2.9% and 2.0%, respectively. Moreover, the frequencies of PPROM in Asian and Caucasian COVID-19-infected pregnant women were 10.2% and 5.8%, respectively. This meta-analysis showed that the frequencies of IUGR and PPROM in COVID-19-infected pregnant women were 2.6% and 9.9%, respectively.

630198,Cost-effectiveness of public health strategies for COVID-19 epidemic control in South Africa,2020-07-01,"Replication of the ∼30 kb-long coronavirus genome is mediated by a complex of non-structural proteins (NSP), in which NSP7 and NSP8 play a critical role in regulating the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) activity of NSP12. The assembly of NSP7, NSP8 and NSP12 proteins is highly dynamic in solution, yet the underlying mechanism remains elusive. We report the crystal structure of the complex between NSP7 and NSP8 of SARS-CoV-2, revealing a 2:2 heterotetrameric form. Formation of the NSP7-NSP8 complex is mediated by two distinct oligomer interfaces, with interface I responsible for heterodimeric NSP7-NSP8 assembly, and interface II mediating the heterotetrameric interaction between the two NSP7-NSP8 dimers. Structure-guided mutagenesis, combined with biochemical and enzymatic assays, further reveals a structural coupling between the two oligomer interfaces, as well as the importance of these interfaces for the RdRP activity of the NSP7-NSP8-NSP12 complex. Finally, we identify an NSP7 mutation that differentially affects the stability of the NSP7-NSP8 and NSP7-NSP8-NSP12 complexes leading to a selective impairment of the RdRP activity. Together, this study provides deep insights into the structure and mechanism for the dynamic assembly of NSP7 and NSP8 in regulating the replication of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, with important implications for antiviral drug development.","Biswal, Mahamaya; Diggs, Stephen; Xu, Duo; Khudaverdyan, Nelli; Lu, Jiuwei; Fang, Jian; Blaha, Gregor; Hai, Rong; Song, Jikui",Nucleic Acids Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33999154/; https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkab370,101

Many chronic diseases have been linked to risk factors such as poor diet and physical inactivity. Data for these behavioral risk factors are usually obtained from surveys, which can be delayed by years. Behavioral data from digital sources, including social media and search engines, could be used for timely monitoring of behavioral risk factors. OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to propose the use of digital data from internet sources for monitoring changes in behavioral risk factors in Africa. METHODS: We obtained the adjusted volume of search queries submitted to Google for 108 terms related to diet, exercise, and disease from 2010 to 2016. We also obtained the obesity and overweight prevalence for 52 African countries from the World Health Organization (WHO) for the same period. Machine learning algorithms (ie, random forest, support vector machine, Bayes generalized linear model, gradient boosting, and an ensemble of the individual methods) were used to identify search terms and patterns that correlate with changes in obesity and overweight prevalence across Africa. Out-of-sample predictions were used to assess and validate the model performance. RESULTS: The study included 52 African countries. In 2016, the WHO reported an overweight prevalence ranging from 20.9% (95% credible interval [CI] 17.1%-25.0%) to 66.8% (95% CI 62.4%-71.0%) and an obesity prevalence ranging from 4.5% (95% CI 2.9%-6.5%) to 32.5% (95% CI 27.2%-38.1%) in Africa. The highest obesity and overweight prevalence were noted in the northern and southern regions. Google searches for diet-, exercise-, and obesity-related terms explained 97.3% (root-mean-square error [RMSE] 1.15) of the variation in obesity prevalence across all 52 countries. Similarly, the search data explained 96.6% (RMSE 2.26) of the variation in the overweight prevalence. The search terms yoga, exercise, and gym were most correlated with changes in obesity and overweight prevalence in countries with the highest prevalence. CONCLUSIONS: Information-seeking patterns for diet- and exercise-related terms could indicate changes in attitudes toward and engagement in risk factors or healthy behaviors. These trends could capture population changes in risk factor prevalence, inform digital and physical interventions, and supplement official data from surveys.","Oladeji, Olubusola; Zhang, Chi; Moradi, Tiam; Tarapore, Dharmesh; Stokes, Andrew C; Marivate, Vukosi; Sengeh, Moinina D; Nsoesie, Elaine O",JMIR Public Health Surveill,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33913815/; https://doi.org/10.2196/24348,101

We report the findings of the first round of a national serosurvey, conducted to estimate the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among adult population of India. METHODS: From May 11 to June 4, 2020, a randomly sampled, community-based survey was conducted in 700 villages/wards, selected from the 70 districts of the 21 States of India, categorized into four strata based on the incidence of reported COVID-19 cases. Four hundred adults per district were enrolled from 10 clusters with one adult per household. Serum samples were tested for IgG antibodies using COVID Kavach ELISA kit. All positive serum samples were re-tested using Euroimmun SARS-CoV-2 ELISA. Adjusting for survey design and serial test performance, weighted seroprevalence, number of infections, infection to case ratio (ICR) and infection fatality ratio (IFR) were calculated. Logistic regression was used to determine the factors associated with IgG positivity. RESULTS: Total of 30,283 households were visited and 28,000 individuals were enrolled. Population-weighted seroprevalence after adjusting for test performance was 0.73 per cent [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.34-1.13]. Males, living in urban slums and occupation with high risk of exposure to potentially infected persons were associated with seropositivity. A cumulative 6,468,388 adult infections (95% CI: 3,829,029-11,199,423) were estimated in India by the early May. The overall ICR was between 81.6 (95% CI: 48.3-141.4) and 130.1 (95% CI: 77.0-225.2) with May 11 and May 3, 2020 as plausible reference points for reported cases. The IFR in the surveyed districts from high stratum, where death reporting was more robust, was 11.72 (95% CI: 7.21-19.19) to 15.04 (9.26-24.62) per 10,000 adults, using May 24 and June 1, 2020 as plausible reference points for reported deaths. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was low among the adult population in India around the beginning of May 2020. Further national and local serosurveys are recommended to better inform the public health strategy for containment and mitigation of the epidemic in various parts of the country.","Murhekar, Manoj V.; Bhatnagar, Tarun; Selvaraju, Sriram; Rade, Kiran; Saravanakumar, V.; Vivian Thangaraj, Jeromie Wesley; Kumar, Muthusamy Santhosh; Shah, Naman; Sabarinathan, R.; Turuk, Alka; Anand, Parveen Kumar; Asthana, Smita; Balachandar, Rakesh; Bangar, Sampada Dipak; Bansal, Avi Kumar; Bhat, Jyothi; Chakraborty, Debjit; Rangaraju, Chethana; Chopra, Vishal; Das, Dasarathi; Deb, Alok Kumar; Devi, Kangjam Rekha; Dwivedi, Gaurav Raj; Salim Khan, S.

Para cuantificar el grado de afectación se han descrito varios scores, aunque no existe evidencia de si su determinación podría tener alguna capacidad predictiva de evolución desfavorable. Metodología Estudio prospectivo de cohortes en el que se incluyeron pacientes ingresados por COVID-19. La muestra se estratificó en función de la evolución clínica, considerándose desfavorable en los pacientes que precisaron soporte respiratorio invasivo o no invasivo. Se analizaron biomarcadores al ingreso y el mismo día de la ET, así como las escalas pronósticas al ingreso. Según la posibilidad de sedestación o no se realizó el score ecográfico en 8 o 14 áreas. Resultados: Se incluyeron 44 pacientes, 13 (29,5%) con necesidad posterior de soporte ventilatorio. En todos se exploraron 8 áreas y en 35 (79,5%) las 14. Las zonas más afectadas fueron los lóbulos inferiores a nivel posterior. Se detectaron diferencias significativas entre los dos grupos en las escalas multidimensionales SOFA y quick SOFA, la PCR y LDH del mismo día de la ET y la puntuación de los scores ecográficos. La mejor área bajo la curva ROC (AUC), se obtuvo con el score de 14 áreas, siendo de 0,88 (IC95%: 0,75-0,99). Su sensibilidad y especificidad para un punto de corte 13,5 fue de 100% y 61,5%. Conclusiones: El uso de scores para cuantificar la afectación pulmonar mediante ET, proporciona información útil para facilitar la estratificación del riesgo en los pacientes hospitalizados con COVID-19. Objective: Thoracic ultrasound (TUS) has been shown to be useful in the diagnosis of Covid-19 pulmonary involvement. Several scores for quantifying the degree of involvement have been described, although there is no evidence to show that they have any capacity for predicting unfavorable progress. Methodology Prospective cohort study of patients hospitalized for Covid-19. The sample was stratified according to clinical course, and patients requiring invasive or non-invasive respiratory support were classified as having unfavorable progress. Biomarkers were analyzed at admission and on the same day that TUS was performed. Prognostic scales were also determined at admission. The ultrasound score was obtained in 8 or 14 areas, depending on the patient's ability to sit. Results: We included 44 patients, 13 (29,5%) of whom subsequently needed ventilatory support. Eight areas were explored in all patients and 14 areas in 35 (79.5%). The most affected areas were the posterior lower lobes. Significant differences were found between the two groups on the SOFA and quick SOFA multidimensional scales, and PCR and LDH on the same day as TUS, and the ultrasound scores. The best area under the ROC curve (AUC) was obtained with the 14-area score, with a result of 0.88 (95% CI: 0.75-0.99). Its sensitivity and specificity for a cut-off score of 13.5 were 100% and 61.5%, respectively. Conclusions: The use of scores to quantify lung involvement measured by TUS provides useful information, facilitating risk stratification in patients hospitalized with Covid-19.","Cristina, Ramos Hernández; Maribel, Botana Rial; Alberto, Pazos Area Luis; Marta, Núñez Fernández; Silvia, Pérez Fernández; Martín, Rubianes González; Manuel, Crespo Casal; Alberto, Fernández Villar",Arch Bronconeumol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33067026/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0300289620302994; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arbres.2020.07.043; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0300289620302994?v=s5,101

Through its Emerging Viral Pathogen Guidance for Antimicrobial Pesticides, the US Environmental Protection Agency has approved numerous surface disinfectant products for use against SARS-CoV-2. Despite their widespread use and range of associated health hazards, the majority of active ingredients in antimicrobial products, such as surface disinfectants, lack established occupational exposure limits (OELs) to assist occupational health professionals in characterizing risks from exposures to these chemicals. Based on established approaches from various organizations, a framework for deriving OELs specific to antimicrobial agents was developed that relies on a weight-of-evidence evaluation of the available data. This framework involves (1) a screening-level toxicological assessment based on a review of the existing literature and recommendations, (2) identification of the critical adverse effect(s) and dose–response relationship(s), (3) identification of alternative health-based exposure limits (HBELs), (4) derivation of potential OELs based on identified points of departure and uncertainty factors and/or modification of existing alternative HBELs, and (5) selection of an appropriate OEL. To demonstrate the use of this framework, a case study is described for selection of an OEL for a disinfectant product containing quaternary ammonium compounds (quats). Three potential OELs were derived for this product based on irritation toxicity data, developmental and reproductive toxicity (DART) data, and modification of an existing HBEL. The final selected OEL for the quats-containing product was 0.1 mg/m(3), derived from modification of an existing HBEL. This value represented the lowest resulting value of the three approaches, and thus, was considered protective of irritation and potential DART.","Dotson, G Scott; Lotter, Jason T; Zisook, Rachel E; Gaffney, Shannon H; Maier, Andrew; Colvin, Jonathan",Toxicol Ind Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33241765/; https://doi.org/10.1177/0748233720970438,101

Beyond this role in bioenergetics regulation, mitochondria play a role in several other cellular processes including lipid metabolism, cellular calcium homeostasis, autophagy and immune responses. Furthermore, mitochondria are highly dynamic organelles: as all other cellular endomembranes, they are continuously moving along cytoskeleton, and, most importantly, they constantly interact one with each other by membrane tethering, fusion and fission. This review aims to highlight the tight correlation between the morphodynamics of mitochondria and their biological function(s), in physiological as well as stress conditions, in particular nutrient deprivation, pathogen attack and some human diseases.

CASE PRESENTATION: The patient, a 63-year-old Caucasian man, received venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support after rapid deterioration of lung function on day 6 after admission to hospital. After initial stabilization on lung protective ventilation and prone positioning, he started to develop mild bleeding complications until he went into occult profound hemorrhagic shock. Causative was a massive hemothorax of the right hemithorax with mediastinal shifting due to spontaneous bleeding from a pulmonal artery in a heavily remodeled right inferior lobe. Histopathological examination of the resected tissue showed signs of an organizing fibrinous pneumonia with focal parenchyma necrosis. After surviving a massive bleeding event caused by necrotizing pneumonia, the patient made a swift recovery and was discharged to rehabilitation 31 days after initial hospital admission. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of severely elevated inflammatory markers and pulmonary hemorrhage should arouse suspicion of necrotizing pneumonia. In necrotizing pneumonia, the possibility of severe intrathoracic bleeding complications should be kept in mind if it comes to sudden deterioration of the patient.

The objective of this article is to review the areas in which clinical information systems (CIS) can be and have been utilized to support and enhance the response of healthcare systems to pandemics, focusing on COVID-19. Methods: PubMed/MEDLINE, Google Scholar, the tables of contents of major informatics journals, and the bibliographies of articles were searched for studies pertaining to CIS, pandemics, and COVID-19 through October 2020. The most informative and detailed studies were highlighted, while many others were referenced. Results: CIS were heavily relied upon by health systems and governmental agencies worldwide in response to COVID-19. Technology-based screening tools were developed to assist rapid case identification and appropriate triaging. Clinical care was supported by utilizing the electronic health record (EHR) to onboard frontline providers to new protocols, offer clinical decision support, and improve systems for diagnostic testing. Telehealth became the most rapidly adopted medical trend in recent history and an essential strategy for allowing safe and effective access to medical care. Artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms were developed to enhance screening, diagnostic imaging, and predictive analytics - though evidence of improved outcomes remains limited. Geographic information systems and big data enabled real-time dashboards vital for epidemic monitoring, hospital preparedness strategies, and health policy decision making. Digital contact tracing systems were implemented to assist a labor-intensive task with the aim of curbing transmission. Large scale data sharing, effective health information exchange, and interoperability of EHRs remain challenges for the informatics community with immense clinical and academic potential. CIS must be used in combination with engaged stakeholders and operational change management in order to meaningfully improve patient outcomes. Conclusion: Managing a pandemic requires widespread, timely, and effective distribution of reliable information. In the past year, CIS and informaticists made prominent and influential contributions in the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Reeves, J.

Under clinical trials, some of the repurposed antiviral drugs have been applied to COVID‐19 patients and reported the efficacy of the drugs with the diverse inferences. Molecular topology has been developed in recent years as an influential approach for drug design and discovery in which molecules that are structurally related show similar pharmacological properties. It permits a purely mathematical description of the molecular structure so that in the development of identification of new drugs can be found through adequate topological indices. In this paper, we study the structural properties of the several antiviral drugs such as chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir, ritonavir, remdesivir, theaflavin, nafamostat, camostat, umifenovir and bevacizumab by considering the distance and bond measures of chemical compounds.

Rigorous qualitative analysis of the model shows that it exhibits essentially the same (equilibrium) dynamics regardless of which of the two incidence functions is used. In particular, for each of the two incidence functions, the model has a globally asymptotically stable disease-free equilibrium whenever the associated reproduction threshold quantity is less than unity. Further, it has a unique endemic equilibrium when the threshold quantity exceeds unity. For the case with the Holling type II incidence function, it is shown that the unique endemic equilibrium of the model is globally asymptotically stable for a special case. The permanence of the disease is also established for the model with the Holling type II incidence function. Furthermore, it is shown that adding time delay to and/or replacing the standard incidence function with the Holling type II incidence function in the corresponding autonomous quarantine/isolation model with standard incidence (considered in Safi and Gumel (2010) [10]) does not alter the qualitative dynamics of the autonomous system (with respect to the elimination or persistence of the disease). Finally, numerical simulations of the model with standard incidence show that the disease burden decreases with increasing time delay (incubation period). Furthermore, models with time delay seem to be more suitable for modeling the 2003 SARS outbreaks than those without time delay.","Safi, Mohammad A.; Gumel, Abba B.",Nonlinear Anal Real World Appl,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1468121810001306; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288639/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nonrwa.2010.06.009; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1468121810001306,101
637182,Early impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and social restrictions on ambulance missions,2021-04-15,"BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are managed predominantly in primary care. However, key opportunities to optimize treatment are often not realized due to unrecognized disease and delayed implementation of appropriate interventions for both diagnosed and undiagnosed individuals. The COllaboratioN on QUality improvement initiative for achieving Excellence in STandards of COPD care (CONQUEST) is the first-of-its-kind, collaborative, interventional COPD registry. It comprises an integrated quality improvement program focusing on patients (diagnosed and undiagnosed) at a modifiable and higher risk of COPD exacerbations. The first step in CONQUEST was the development of quality standards (QS). The QS will be imbedded in routine primary and secondary care, and are designed to drive patient-centered, targeted, risk-based assessment and management optimization. Our aim is to provide an overview of the CONQUEST QS, including how they were developed, as well as the rationale for, and evidence to support, their inclusion in healthcare systems. METHODS: The QS were developed (between November 2019 and December 2020) by the CONQUEST Global Steering Committee, including 11 internationally recognized experts with a specialty and research focus in COPD. The process included an extensive literature review, generation of QS draft wording, three iterative rounds of review, and consensus. RESULTS: Four QS were developed: 1) identification of COPD target population, 2) assessment of disease and quantification of future risk, 3) non-pharmacological and pharmacological intervention, and 4) appropriate follow-up. Each QS is followed by a rationale statement and a summary of current guidelines and research evidence relating to the standard and its components. CONCLUSION: The CONQUEST QS represent an important step in our aim to improve care for patients with COPD in primary and secondary care. They will help to transform the patient journey, by encouraging early intervention to identify, assess, optimally manage and followup COPD patients with modifiable high risk of future exacerbations.","Pullen, Rachel; Miravitlles, Marc; Sharma, Anita; Singh, Dave; Martinez, Fernando; Hurst, John R; Alves, Luis; Dransfield, Mark; Chen, Rongchang; Muro, Shigeo; Winders, Tonya; Blango, Christopher; Muellerova, Hana; Trudo, Frank; Dorinsky, Paul; Alacqua, Marianna; Morris, Tamsin; Carter, Victoria; Couper, Amy; Jones, Rupert; Kostikas, Konstantinos; Murray, Ruth; Price, David B",Int J Chron Obstruct Pulmon Dis,https://doi.org/10.2147/copd.s313498; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34413639/,101

Many countries have been using the vaccine for decades against tuberculosis (TB). The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a single dose of BCG for infants in TB endemic as well as leprosy high risk countries, and globally almost 130 million infants are vaccinated yearly. The role of BCG is well known in reducing neonatal and childhood death rates. Epidemiological and retrospective cross-sectional studies demonstrated that the BCG vaccination protects the children against respiratory tract infections and lowers the risk of malaria in children. In addition, BCG enhances IFN-γ and IL-10 levels, thus providing immunity against respiratory tract infection even in elderly people. The BCG is also known to provide nonspecific innate immunity against viruses and parasites, through an innate immune mechanism termed ‘trained immunity’ and is defined as the immunological recall of the innate immune system by epigenetic reprogramming. Based on these studies it is suggested that the BCG has the potential to act as a protective agent against COVID-19. Further proven safety records of BCG in humans, its adjuvant activity and low-cost manufacturing make it an attractive option to stop the pandemic and reduce the COVID-19 related mortality. In this review we discuss the heterologous effects of BCG, induction of trained immunity and its implication in development of a potential vaccine against COVID-19 pandemic.","Aspatwar, Ashok; Gong, Wenping; Wang, Shuyong; Wu, Xueqiong; Parkkila, Seppo",International reviews of immunology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33960271/; https://doi.org/10.1080/08830185.2021.1922685,101

However, no studies have assessed health workers’ experiences using qualitative methods during the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States to identify novel factors that could relate to their mental health. In May 2020, we distributed an online survey to health workers across 25 medical centers throughout the United States. The Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, Primary Care-Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, and Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Concise and associated cutoff values were used to assess rates of probable major depression, generalized anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and alcohol use disorder, respectively. To provide insight into the factors shaping these and other mental health conditions, we included two open-ended questions asking respondents to recount their most upsetting and hopeful experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic and how it made them feel. Using a hybrid inductive-abductive approach and thematic content analysis, we created a Social Ecological Model to represent themes among health workers’ experiences within five ecological levels: individual, interpersonal, organization, community, and public policy. Of the 1,132 participants who completed the survey, 14.0% had probable major depression, 15.8% probable generalized anxiety disorder, 23.1% probable post-traumatic stress disorder, and 42.6% probable alcohol use disorder. Individual level themes included participants’ personal health and self-care behaviors. Interpersonal level themes included the health of their social circle, family functioning, and social support. Organization level themes included their hospital’s management, resources, patient care, routine, and teams. Themes in the community level included the media, scientific knowledge about COVID-19, morale, behavior, and support of health workers. Lastly, government and health system leadership and shelter-in-place policy were themes within the public policy level. Our findings provide insights into novel factors that have impacted health workers’ wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic.

There is limited information about prognostic markers that could help clinicians to identify COVID-19 patients with a poor prognosis. Serum levels of the immune activation marker neopterin has shown to be of prognostic value in patients with SARS. The aim of this study was to investigate whether serum neopterin is associated with the severity of COVID-19. METHODS: We included 34 patients with confirmed COVID-19 between March 3 and March 30, 2020. Fifteen patients had mild disease and did not require hospitalization, whereas 19 patients developed severe COVID-19 requiring intensive care. Concentrations of serum neopterin, tryptophan, and kynurenine were measured at and repeatedly after inclusion. RESULTS: We found a more than two-fold higher mean concentration of neopterin in severely ill patients (mean value 42.0 nmol/L (SD 18.2)) compared to patients with mild symptoms (16.9 nmol/L (SD 11.0)). All of the severe cases had elevated neopterin concentrations (> 9.1 nmol/L) at the initial sampling with values ranging from 17.2 to 86.7 nmol/L. In comparison, 10 of 15 patients with mild disease had neopterin levels above 9.1 nmol/L, with concentrations in the range from 4.9 to 31.6 nmol/L. Neopterin levels gradually decreased during the course of COVID-19, but severe cases maintained elevated levels for a longer period. Moreover, lower levels of tryptophan and higher levels of kynurenine, indicating an increased tryptophan catabolism, were seen in the group with severe cases. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, we found that serum neopterin levels are associated with the severity of COVID-19. Our findings suggest that neopterin could be used as a prognostic marker, but further studies are needed to elucidate how it can be used in the clinic.","Robertson, Josefina; Gostner, Johanna M.; Nilsson, Staffan; Andersson, Lars-Magnus; Fuchs, Dietmar; Gisslen, Magnus",BMC Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33302893/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-020-05671-7,101

In this study we investigated the effects of β-sitosterol on influenza virus-induced inflammation and acute lung injury and the molecular mechanisms. We demonstrate that β-sitosterol (150–450 μg/mL) dose-dependently suppresses inflammatory response through NF-κB and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling in influenza A virus (IAV)-infected cells, which was accompanied by decreased induction of interferons (IFNs) (including Type I and III IFN). Furthermore, we revealed that the anti-inflammatory effect of β-sitosterol resulted from its inhibitory effect on retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) signaling, led to decreased STAT1 signaling, thus affecting the transcriptional activity of ISGF3 (interferon-stimulated gene factor 3) complexes and resulting in abrogation of the IAV-induced proinflammatory amplification effect in IFN-sensitized cells. Moreover, β-sitosterol treatment attenuated RIG-I-mediated apoptotic injury of alveolar epithelial cells (AEC) via downregulation of pro-apoptotic factors. In a mouse model of influenza, pre-administration of β-sitosterol (50, 200 mg·kg(−1)·d(−1), i.g., for 2 days) dose-dependently ameliorated IAV-mediated recruitment of pathogenic cytotoxic T cells and immune dysregulation. In addition, pre-administration of β-sitosterol protected mice from lethal IAV infection. Our data suggest that β-sitosterol blocks the immune response mediated by RIG-I signaling and deleterious IFN production, providing a potential benefit for the treatment of influenza.","Zhou, Bei-xian; Li, Jing; Liang, Xiao-li; Pan, Xi-ping; Hao, Yan-bing; Xie, Pei-fang; Jiang, Hai-ming; Yang, Zi-feng; Zhong, Nan-shan",Acta Pharmacol Sin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32504068/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41401-020-0403-9,101

Limited human-to-human transmission, leading to some case clusters, has been reported. MERS-CoV has been reported in dromedary camels but phenotypic characterisation of such viruses is limited. We aimed to compare MERS-CoV isolates from dromedaries in Saudi Arabia and Egypt with a prototype human MERS-CoV to assess virus replication competence and cell tropism in ex-vivo cultures of human bronchus and lung. Methods We characterised MERS-CoV viruses from dromedaries in Saudi Arabia and Egypt and compared them with a human MERS-CoV reference strain. We assessed viral replication kinetics and competence in Vero-E6 cells (rhesus monkey), tissue tropism in cultures of ex-vivo human bronchial and lung tissues, and cytokine and chemokine induction, gene expression, and quantification of viral RNA in Calu-3 cells (human respiratory tract). We used mock-infected tissue as negative controls for ex-vivo experiments and influenza A H5N1 as a positive control for cytokine and chemokine induction experiments in Calu-3 cells. Findings We isolated three dromedary strains, two from Saudi Arabia (Dromedary/Al-Hasa-KFU-HKU13/2013 [AH13] and Dromedary/Al-Hasa-KFU-HKU19D/2013 [AH19D]), and one from Egypt (Dromedary/Egypt-NRCE-HKU270/2013 [NRCE-HKU270]). The human and dromedary MERS-CoV strains had similar viral replication competence in Vero-E6 cells and respiratory tropism in ex-vivo cultures of the human respiratory tract, and had similar ability to evade interferon responses in the human-respiratory-tract-derived cell line Calu-3. Interpretation The similarity of virus tropism and replication competence of human and dromedary MERS-CoV from the Arabian peninsula, and genetically diverse dromedary viruses from Egypt, in ex-vivo cultures of the human respiratory tract suggests that dromedary viruses from Saudi Arabia and Egypt are probably infectious to human beings. Exposure to zoonotic MERS-CoV is probably occurring in a wider geographical region beyond the Arabian peninsula.

This version improves the functionality of the software, including an easy way to determine the potential biological features affected by the candidates found. The quadruplex definitions of the algorithm were optimized for SARS-CoV-2. Using a lax quadruplex definition ruleset, which accepts amongst other parameters two residue G- and C-tracks, 512 potential quadruplex candidates were discovered. These sequences were evaluated by their in vitro formation probability, their position in the viral RNA, their uniqueness and their conservation rates (calculated in over seventeen thousand different COVID-19 clinical cases and sequenced at different times and locations during the ongoing pandemic). These results were then compared subsequently to other Coronaviridae members, other Group IV (+)ssRNA viruses and the entire viral realm. Sequences found in common with other viral species were further analyzed and characterized. Sequences with high scores unique to the SARS-CoV-2 were studied to investigate the variations amongst similar species. Quadruplex formation of the best candidates were then confirmed experimentally.

However, a majority of the previous data came from large institutional centers with high academic output. We aimed to explore the association between patient’s characteristics, hematological parameters, and outcomes in admitted persons with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) at our community hospital in an inner city. Methods This study is a retrospective chart review designed to evaluate the potential associations between demographic and clinical characteristics of our patient population and their outcomes when testing positive for SARS-CoV-2. The study population included patients hospitalized in the Saint Francis Medical Center from January 2020 to September 2020. This pilot study included 50 out of the 275 hospitalized patients with a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection during this timeframe. Data collection from the patient’s chart included age, sex, comorbidities, admission complete blood cell count, and use of Remdesivir, steroids, and plasma. The primary outcome was all-cause in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included the need for mechanical ventilation and ICU admission. Results In this pilot study, there was an overall mortality rate of 32% (16 out of 50 patients). Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) of 3 points or above was present in 87.5% of the patients in the mortality group versus 41.1% in patients who survived (p = 0.0021). There was no statistically significant difference in mortality between males and females after adjusting for other variables with an odds ratio (OR) of 0.19 (95% CI 0.02-1.80, p = 0.09). There were no statically significant differences in mortality between Caucasians, non-Hispanic, Black, and Latinx patients (p = 0.466). Admission platelets were lower in the mortality group with a mean of 157.7 ± 43.23 (Thou/ul) versus 250.06 ± 93.95 (Thou/ul) in the survivors (p = 0.0005). Admission white blood cell count in the mortality group was lower than the survivor group with an average of 5.93 ± 2.58 (Thou/ul) versus 9.3 ± 4.14 (Thou/ul) (p = 0.0039), respectively. The plasma D-dimer level of 3 mg/L fibrinogen equivalent unit (FEU) or higher was associated with increased mortality. There was no association of C-reactive protein (CRP) with mortality (p = 0.93 and p = 0.54, respectively); however, the CRP level revealed an association with ICU admission (p = 0.03). The use of steroids, Remdesivir, and plasma did not have a statistically significant effect on mortality, ICU admission, or sepsis in our study. Conclusion In this study, older age, higher CCI, and plasma D-dimer level of 3 mg/L FEU or higher were associated with higher mortality among COVID-19 patients. White blood cell count and platelet count were significantly lower in the mortality group in comparison to the survivor group. However, there was no statistical difference in lymphocyte count between the mortality group and the survivor group. COVID-19 patients with thrombocytopenia or serum CRP level of 15 mg/dL or higher were more likely to be admitted to ICU.","Almonte, Marcos; Au, Xiu Ying; Ali, Mustafa; Rajabalee, Nafiisah; Hasan, Syed; Shibre, Temesgen; Li, Yiting; Kaplan, Adam C",Cureus,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34540480/; https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.17255,101

Thus, the investigation of online social network services is of paramount importance. In this paper, we use the sentiment analysis, which detects attitudes and emotions toward issues of society posted in social media, to understand the actual economic situation. To this end, two steps are suggested. In the first step, after training the sentiment classifiers with several big data sources of social media datasets, we consider three types of feature sets: feature vector, sequence vector and a combination of dictionary-based feature and sequence vectors. Then, the performance of six classifiers is assessed: MaxEnt-L1, C4.5 decision tree, SVM-kernel, Ada-boost, Naïve Bayes and MaxEnt. In the second step, we collect datasets that are relevant to several economic words that the public use to explicitly express their opinions. Finally, we use a vector auto-regression analysis to confirm our hypothesis. The results show the statistically significant relationship between public sentiment and economic performance. That is, “depression” and “unemployment” lead to KOSPI. Also, it shows that the extracted keywords from the sentiment analysis, such as “price,” “year-end-tax” and “budget deficit,” cause the exchange rates.","Lee, Hyeonseo; Lee, Nakyeong; Seo, Harim; Song, Min",J Supercomput,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11227-018-02737-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32435085/,101

Given their potentially elevated risk, our aim was to evaluate differences from pre-college closures to post-closure in mental health symptoms, alcohol, and cannabis use. Participants (N = 4749) were from seven U.S. public universities/colleges. They were 70.1 % female and 48.5 % white, non-Hispanic/Latino, with 48.1 % in their first college/university year. 30-day retrospective assessments of alcohol and cannabis use, and past 2-week retrospective assessments of anxiety, depression, anger, and insomnia were captured at the time of the survey. We examined differences between those providing data pre- and post-university closure via linear and negative binomial regressions. Alcohol and cannabis use days were 13 % and 24 % higher, respectively, from pre-to post-university closure; also, prevalence of any 30-day alcohol use and alcohol use consequences were both higher in the post-closure sample (odds ratios = 1.34 and 1.31, respectively). In contrast, days of binge alcohol use were 4 % lower in the post-closing sample. Depressive symptoms and anger were both modestly higher in post-closing participants (d < 0.1), with no differences in anxiety symptoms or insomnia. The modest differences in substance use and mental health from pre-closure through two months post-college closure suggest unexpected resilience in a large and diverse sample of students. College health providers will need to identify those students experiencing the greatest increases in mental health symptoms and substance use, using innovative outreach and treatment.","Schepis, Ty S.; De Nadai, Alessandro S.; Bravo, Adrian J.; Looby, Alison; Villarosa-Hurlocker, Margo C.; Earleywine, Mitch",J Psychiatr Res,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022395621004738; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34325235/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2021.07.040; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022395621004738,101

Unfortunately it also clear that aspects of innate immunity can lead to severe morbidity or mortality from IAV, including inflammatory lung injury, bacterial superinfection, and exacerbation of reactive airways disease. We review broadly the virus and host factors that result in adverse outcomes from IAV and show evidence that inflammatory responses can become damaging even apart from changes in viral replication per se, with special focus on the positive and adverse effects of neutrophils and monocytes. We then evaluate in detail the role of soluble innate inhibitors including surfactant protein D and antimicrobial peptides that have a potential dual capacity for down-regulating viral replication and also inhibiting excessive inflammatory responses and how these innate host factors could possibly be harnessed to treat IAV infection. Where appropriate we draw comparisons and contrasts the SARS-CoV viruses and IAV in an effort to point out where the extensive knowledge existing regarding severe IAV infection could help guide research into severe COVID 19 illness or vice versa.","Hartshorn, Kevan L.",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fcimb.2020.563850; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33194802/,101

BACKGROUND As COVID-19 is a new disease, its spread and emergence cause fear, anxiety and confusion among the general population. Nurses are in close contact with infected persons, and their knowledge plays an important role in preventing the transmission chain. METHODS In this cross-sectional study, 207 nurses were selected using convenience sampling from 29 March to 19 April 2020. The study used a questionnaire assessing the nurses' baseline characteristics, their source of information, knowledge, concerns, the perceived impact and their preparedness for the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS Around half of the surveyed nurses (51.2%) reported that the Ministry of Health's and World Health Organization's websites and official pages were their main sources of information. The majority of nurses (81.6%) knew the nature of the virus, 83.6% agreed that their job puts them at risk of infection with COVID-19 and 72% felt personally prepared for the pandemic. CONCLUSION The majority of nurses had an acceptable level of knowledge regarding COVID-19.

Little is known on the magnitude and the durability of antibody response against COVID-19. There is consensus that patients with immune dysfunction, such as dialysis patients, may be unable to mount a robust and durable humoral immunity after infections. Recent studies showed that dialysis patients seroconverted after COVID-19, but data on the durability of the immune response are missing. We reported the data of a durable anti-spike protein seroconversion after natural SARS-CoV-2 infection in three patients on hemodialysis with a mean age of 67.2 ± 13.8 years. A mean antibody titer of 212.6 ± 174.9 UA/ml (Liaison®, DiaSorin) was found after one year (range, 366-374 days) from the diagnosis of COVID-19. In conclusion, this case series provided evidence that patients receiving hemodialysis who recovered from severe COVID-19 were able to mount a long-lasting immune response against SARS-CoV-2. Although the protective capacity of this long-term immunity remains to be determined, these patients did not report signs of reinfection after recovery from COVID-19.","Alfano, Gaetano; Fontana, Francesco; Morisi, Niccolò; Giaroni, Francesco; Mori, Giacomo; Guaraldi, Giovanni; Magistroni, Riccardo; Cappelli, Gianni",Hemodialysis international.

650420,Data Sharing in Southeast Asia During the First Wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021-06-16,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) remodels the cell surface of infected cells to facilitate viral dissemination and promote immune evasion. The membrane-associated viral protein U (Vpu) accessory protein encoded by HIV-1 plays a key role in this process by altering cell surface levels of multiple host proteins. Using an unbiased quantitative plasma membrane profiling approach, we previously identified CD47 as a putative host target downregulated by Vpu. CD47 is a ubiquitously expressed cell surface protein that interacts with the myeloid cell inhibitory receptor signal regulatory protein-alpha (SIRPα) to deliver a “don’t-eat-me” signal, thus protecting cells from phagocytosis. In this study, we investigate whether CD47 modulation by HIV-1 Vpu might promote the susceptibility of macrophages to viral infection via phagocytosis of infected CD4(+) T cells. Indeed, we find that Vpu downregulates CD47 expression on infected CD4(+) T cells, leading to enhanced capture and phagocytosis by macrophages. We further provide evidence that this Vpu-dependent process allows a C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5)-tropic transmitted/founder (T/F) virus, which otherwise poorly infects macrophages in its cell-free form, to efficiently infect macrophages. Importantly, we show that HIV-1-infected cells expressing a Vpu-resistant CD47 mutant are less prone to infecting macrophages through phagocytosis. Mechanistically, Vpu forms a physical complex with CD47 through its transmembrane domain and targets the latter for lysosomal degradation. These results reveal a novel role of Vpu in modulating macrophage infection, which has important implications for HIV-1 transmission in early stages of infection and the establishment of viral reservoir.","Cong, Lijun; Sugden, Scott M.; Leclair, Pascal; Lim, Chinten James; Pham, Tram N.

Using a novel SARS-Cov-2-specific artificial antigen presenting cell (aAPC), coupled with a rapid expansion protocol (REP) as practiced in tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) therapy, we generate an immune catalytic quantity of Virus Induced Lymphocytes (VIL). Using T cell receptor (TCR)-specific aAPCs carrying co-stimulatory molecules and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class-I immunodominant SARS-CoV-2 peptide-pentamer complexes, we expand virus-specific VIL derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of convalescent COVID-19 patients up to 1000-fold. This is achieved in a clinically relevant 7-day vein-to-vein time-course as a potential adoptive cell therapy (ACT) for COVID-19. We also evaluate this approach for other viral pathogens using Cytomegalovirus (CMV)-specific VIL from donors as a control. Rapidly expanded VIL are enriched in virus antigen-specificity and show an activated, polyfunctional cytokine profile and T effector memory phenotype which may contribute to a robust immune response. Virus-specific T cells can also be delivered allogeneically via MHC-typing and patient human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matching to provide pragmatic treatment in a large-scale therapeutic setting. These data suggest that VIL may represent a novel therapeutic option that warrants further clinical investigation in the armamentarium against COVID-19 and other possible future pandemics.","Sivapalan, Rohan; Liu, Jinyan; Chakraborty, Krishnendu; Arthofer, Elisa; Choudhry, Modassir; Barie, Philip S.; Barouch, Dan H.; Henley, Tom",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-94654-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34315945/,101

Only a few reports of AHLE in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients have been described to date. We report a case of COVID-19-related AHLE along with a literature review describing salient clinical and imaging characteristics. METHODS: A literature search was performed on Medline (2020-present), PubMed, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, and Google scholar on 28 January 2021 for all articles published using MeSH terms “COVID-19” or “SARS-CoV-2” with “Acute hemorrhagic leukoencephalitis” or “Acute hemorrhagic encephalitis.” Relevant case reports and case series describing clinical and imaging features of AHLE associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection were included, data compiled, and critically reviewed. RESULTS: Acute onset encephalopathy and rapidly deteriorating neurological status is the common clinical presentation in AHLE. CSF analysis reveals elevated proteins and lymphocytic pleocytosis. Typical neuroimaging features include multifocal, variable-sized, poorly defined cerebral white matter lesions with cortical sparing. Involvement of the brainstem, cerebellar peduncles, and deep grey matter can also occur, although rarely. Lesions are hyperintense on T2-weighted (T2W) and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images, hypointense on T1W images, and show microhemorrhages, variable diffusion restriction, and post-contrast enhancement. Extensive microhemorrhages, brainstem involvement, and gross hemorrhage often portend a poor prognosis. CONCLUSION: Heightened awareness about the clinical and imaging presentation of COVID-19-related AHLE can positively alter the outcome in a select few by enabling early diagnosis and aggressive management.","Varadan, Baskaran; Shankar, Abhinaya; Rajakumar, Akila; Subramanian, Shubha; Sathya, A.

To support the development of a COVID-19 management guideline, we conducted a systematic review that addressed the benefits and harms of 7 antiviral treatments for COVID-19. METHODS We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PubMed and 3 Chinese databases (CNKI, WANFANG and SinoMed) through Apr. 19, medRxiv and Chinaxiv through Apr. 27, and Chongqing VIP through Apr. 30, 2020. We included studies of ribavirin, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, umifenovir (arbidol), favipravir, interferon and lopinavir/ritonavir. If direct evidence from COVID-19 studies was not available, we included indirect evidence from studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) for efficacy outcomes and other acute respiratory viral infections for safety outcomes. RESULTS In patients with nonsevere COVID-19 illness, the death rate was extremely low, precluding an important effect on mortality. We found only very low-quality evidence with little or no suggestion of benefit for most treatments and outcomes in both nonsevere and severe COVID-19. An exception was treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir, for which we found low-quality evidence for a decrease in length of stay in the intensive care unit (risk difference 5 d shorter, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0 to 9 d) and hospital stay (risk difference 1 d shorter, 95% CI 0 to 2 d). For safety outcomes, evidence was of low or very low quality, with the exception of treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir for which moderate-quality evidence suggested likely increases in diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.

The reason why its impact seems to be less pronounced in the elderly may be due to the concomitant presence of other comorbidities. However, all reports only focus on BMI, an indirect marker of body fat. Aim To explore the impact on COVID-19 severity of abdominal fat as a marker of body composition easily collected in patients undergoing a chest CT scan. METHODS: Patients included in this retrospective study were consecutively enrolled among those admitted to an Emergency Department in Rome, Italy, who tested positive for SARS-Cov-2 and underwent a chest CT scan in March 2020. Data were extracted from electronic medical records. RESULTS: 150 patients were included (64.7% male, mean age 64 ± 16 years). Visceral fat (VAT) was significantly higher in patients requiring intensive care (p = .032), together with age (p = .009), inflammation markers CRP and LDH (p < .0001, p = .003, respectively), and interstitial pneumonia severity as assessed by a Lung Severity Score (LSS) (p < .0001). Increasing age, lymphocytes, CRP, LDH, D-Dimer, LSS, total abdominal fat as well as VAT were found to have a significant univariate association with the need of intensive care. A multivariate analysis showed that LSS and VAT were independently associated with the need of intensive care (OR: 1.262; 95%CI: 1.0171–1.488; p = .005 and OR: 2.474; 95%CI: 1.017–6.019; p = .046, respectively).

655288,Inequalities in the distribution of National Institutes of Health research project grant funding,2021-09-03,"OBJECTIVES: The United Kingdom and a number of European Union countries are offering and distributing rapid antigen detection tests (RADTs) for self-test use to detect SARS-CoV-2. For instance, Greece, in the midst of its third wave of COVID-19, announced the provision of RADTs for self-testing through retail pharmacies. With the aim to determine the acceptability and feasibility of COVID-19 self-testing, we ran a cross-sectional survey on residents of Greece and Cyprus, aged over 18 years. METHODS: An online survey using the JISC platform was distributed to 1000 individuals who completed the survey anonymously. Data was collated and analyzed for complete responses by chi-squared and logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: A total of 248 complete responses were obtained, with balanced gender distribution and particular demographics representative of the 2 countries. The majority of participants (79%; n = 196) reported willingness to self-test and the remaining individuals reported no (10.5%; n = 26) or don’t know (10.5%; n = 26). Being a university graduate significantly predicted the likelihood of being willing to self-test (odds ratio [OR] = 3.455, P < .001). Pearson Chi-square test found significant differences between university graduates versus non-graduates on the type of COVID-19 test preferred (χ(2) = 8.95, df = 3, P < .03); graduates were more likely to prefer saliva testing and less likely to prefer the finger prick test than non-graduates. CONCLUSIONS: Our survey data evidences the acceptability of home-based self-testing, with a preference for saliva as choice of biological material for sampling. A number of factors, such as accessible reporting, contact tracing infrastructures, central registration, and validation for the implementation of different RADTs need to be taken collectively into consideration before self-testing can be universally and reliably scaled up.","Goggolidou, Paraskevi; Hodges-Mameletzis, Ioannis; Purewal, Satvinder; Karakoula, Aikaterini; Warr, Tracy",J Prim Care Community Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34583571/; https://doi.org/10.1177/21501327211047782,101

656940,Developing Geographical Narratives: Pupils Create Digital Text Adventures with Twine,2020-12-03,"BACKGROUND: Fetal hydrops is a serious condition difficult to manage, often with a poor prognosis, and it is characterized by the collection of fluid in the extravascular compartments. Before 1968, the most frequent cause was the maternal-fetal Rh incompatibility. Today, 90% of the cases are non-immune hydrops fetalis. Multiple fetal anatomic and functional disorders can cause non-immune hydrops fetalis and the pathogenesis is incompletely understood. Etiology varies from viral infections to heart disease, chromosomal abnormalities, hematological and autoimmune causes. CASE SUMMARY: A 38-year-old pregnant woman has neck lymphoadenomegaly, fever, cough, tonsillar plaques at 14 wk of amenorrhea and a rash with widespread itching. At 27.5 wk a fetal ultrasound shows signs of severe anemia and hydrops. Cordocentesis is performed with confirmation of severe fetal anemia and subsequent fetal transfusion. The karyotype is 46, XX, array-comparative genome hybridization (CGH) negative, and infectious tests are not conclusive. In the following days there is a progressive improvement of the indirect signs of fetal anemia. At 33.6 wk, for relapse of severe fetal anemia, further fetal transfusions are necessary and an urgent cesarean section is performed. On the day 12 of life, for the detection of anemia, the newborn is subjected to transfusion of concentrated red blood cells and begins treatment with erythropoietin. Later there is a normalization of blood chemistry values and the baby does not need new transfusions. A 29-year-old pregnant woman, with Sjogren's syndrome and positive Anti-Ro/SSA antibodies, is subjected to serial fetal ecocardio for branch block. At 26.5 wk there is a finding of fetal ascites. Infectious disease tests on amniotic fluid are negative as well as quantitative fluorescent polymerase chain reaction, Array CGH. At cordocentesis Hb is 1.3 mmol/L, consequently fetal transfusion is performed. Also in this case, due to continuous episodes of relapse of fetal anemia with consequent transfusions, at 29.4 wk a cesarean section is performed. On day 9 of life, a treatment with erythropoietin is started in the newborn, but the baby needs three blood transfusions. The search for autoantibodies in the baby found SS-A Ro60 positive, SSA-Ro52 positive and SS-B negative. The hemoglobin values normalized after the disappearance of maternal autoantibodies. CONCLUSION: An attempt to determine the etiology of hydrops should be made at the time of diagnosis because the goal is to treat underlying cause, whenever possible. Even if the infectious examinations are not conclusive, but the pregnancy history is strongly suggestive of infection as in the first case, the infectious etiology must not be excluded. In the second case, instead, transplacental passage of maternal autoantibodies caused hydrops fetalis and severe anemia. Finally, obstetric management must be aimed at fetal support up to an optimal timing for delivery by evaluating risks and benefits to increase the chances of survival without sequelae.","Maranto, Marianna; Cigna, Valentina; Orlandi, Emanuela; Cucinella, Gaspare; Lo Verso, Clelia; Duca, Vincenzo; Picciotto, Francesco",World J Clin Cases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34435022/; https://doi.org/10.12998/wjcc.v9.i22.6531,101

ACCEL TB, a 0.5% accelerated H(2)O(2) (AHP)-based disinfectant described here, is a potential candidate. METHODS: ACCEL TB was tested for its broad-spectrum microbicidal activity, safety and materials compatibility using internationally accepted protocols. Activity against bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and Salmonella choleraesuis) was tested with the AOAC use-dilution method and the first tier of a quantitative carrier test (QCT-1). Mycobactericidal activity was tested against Mycobacterium bovis and Mycobacterium terrae using a quantitative suspension test (QST) and QCT-1, respectively. Fungicidal activity (Trichophyton mentagrophytes) was determined with the AOAC test and QCT-1. Activity against several enveloped and nonenveloped viruses was evaluated using the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) method No. E-1053. Sanitizing action was tested against 7 types of vegetative bacteria with method No. DIS/TSS-10. All microbicidal tests contained an added soil load; in all AOAC tests, it was 5% fetal bovine serum, and, in QCT-1, a mixture of 3 types of proteins in phosphate buffer was used instead. The methods to test for acute oral, dermal, inhalation toxicities, and dermal and eye irritation as well as skin sensitization complied with the requirements of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and the US Environmental Protection Agency (OPPTS 870). Standard methods were also used to test compatibility with metals and plastics. RESULTS: At 20°C, the full-strength product was bactericidal and virucidal in 1 minute and mycobactericidal and fungicidal in 5 minutes. It was nonirritating to skin and eyes. The acute oral LD(50) (lethal dose 50%) was >5000 mg/kg. It was compatible with 12 types of plastic and 3 out of 4 metals. CONCLUSION: The tested formulation showed a high safety and materials compatibility profile in addition to being a fast acting, intermediate-level disinfectant.","Omidbakhsh, Navid; Sattar, Syed A.",Am J Infect Control,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196655305005754; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196655305005754; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16765201/,101

The coronavirus pandemic has hit the world severely, representing the most severe threat to human health in more than a century. The environment from local to global scales has witnessed apparent positive and negative impacts. Global lockdowns have drastically altered the patterns of energy demand and have caused an economic downturn but at the same time, have provided an upside-cleaner global environment. Such immense unintended advantages offer opportunities for unprecedented insights into the dynamics of our natural and built environments that can lead to viable paths for the conservation and perpetuation of the recovered environments and through sensible policies and practices that can help to create new recovery pathways.

STUDY DESIGN A cohort study. METHODS In this cohort study, a total of 323 index cases and 989 related close contacts ages more than 15 years old (family members, relatives, and co-workers) were enrolled using a manual contact tracing approach, and all participants were tested by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction test. In this research, the frequency of symptoms was assessed, the SAR among contacts of index cases was calculated, and the risk factors of COVID-19 were evaluated by the logistic regression model. RESULTS The secondary attack rate for total household members of index cases was estimated at 31.7% (95% CI: 28.8-34.7). It was found that among household contacts, the highest SARs were related to spouses 47.1% (95% CI: 38.7-55.7) and grandparents/parents 39.3% (95% CI: 29.4, 49.9) of index cases, who had also higher risks to become secondary cases (adjusted odds ratio [OR]=2.98, 95% CI: 1.31-6.75 and adjusted OR=2.76, 95% CI: 1.18-6.44, respectively). Considering the occupation of contacts, unemployed and retired people and housewives were most susceptible for transmission of COVID-19. It was revealed that cough was the most prevalent symptom among index and secondary cases. CONCLUSION Our findings indicated that spouses and grandparents/parents of index cases were the most susceptible individuals for COVID-19 transmission. Prolonged exposure with index case before COVID-19 diagnosis raised the chance of infection among secondary cases.","Jashaninejad, Rayhaneh; Doosti-Irani, Amin; Karami, Manoochehr; Keramat, Fariba; Mirzaei, Mohammad",Journal of research in health sciences,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34465637/; https://doi.org/10.34172/jrhs.2021.48,101

Demographic, comorbidity and laboratory determinants of death and of ICU admission were explored in all Danish hospitalised patients. METHODS: National health registries were used to identify all hospitalized patients with a COVID-19 diagnosis. We obtained demographics, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), and laboratory results on admission and explored prognostic factors for death using multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression and competing risk survival analysis. RESULTS: Among 2431 hospitalised patients with COVID-19 between February 27 and July 8 (median age 69 years [IQR 53–80], 54.1% males), 359 (14.8%) needed admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) and 455 (18.7%) died within 30 days of follow-up. The seven-day cumulative incidence of ICU admission was lower for females (7.9%) than for males (16.7%), (p < 0.001). Age, high CCI, elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), urea, creatinine, lymphopenia, neutrophilia and thrombocytopenia within ±24-h of admission were independently associated with death within the first week in the multivariate analysis. Conditional upon surviving the first week, male sex, age, high CCI, elevated CRP, LDH, creatinine, urea and neutrophil count were independently associated with death within 30 days. Males presented with more pronounced laboratory abnormalities on admission. CONCLUSIONS: Advanced age, male sex, comorbidity, higher levels of systemic inflammation and cell-turnover were independent factors for mortality. Age was the strongest predictor for death, moderate to high level of comorbidity were associated with a nearly two-fold increase in mortality.

Contact tracing and quarantining of positive cases are chief strategies of disease control that has been accepted globally. Though scientific knowledge regarding household transmission of the COVID-19 through contact of positive case is sparse. Current systematic review was planned to assess global statistics and characteristics of household secondary attack rate (SAR) of COVID-19. Methods Eligible articles were retrieved through search of – MEDLINE, SCOPUS and EMBASE for the period December 2019 to June 15(th) 2020. Search terms were developed to identify articles reporting household SARs in various countries. After initial screening of 326 articles, 13 eligible studies were included in the final evidence synthesis. Results We found that SAR varies widely across countries with lowest reported rate as 4.6% and highest as 49.56%. The rates were unaffected by confounders such as population of the country, lockdown status and geographic location. Review suggested greater vulnerability of spouse and elderly population for secondary transmission than other household members. It was also observed that quarantining and isolation are most effective strategies for prevention of the secondary transmission of the disease. Symptomatic status of the index case emerged to be a critical factor, with very low transmission probability during asymptomatic phase. Conclusion Present review findings recommend that adequate measures should be provided to protect the vulnerable population as only case tracing and quarantining might be insufficient.

This study aimed to investigate how our appraisal of social situations changed during the pandemic. Methods: In two online surveys, conducted in October 2019 and April 2020, 58 participants rated their personal level of comfort for sketches depicting social situations. Situations were separately categorized according to the risk of a possible COVID-19 infection and changes in ratings were analyzed by using a repeated measures ANOVA. Moreover, potential influencing factors on the change in ratings such as perceived infection risk and social factors like regular frequency and liking of social interactions were examined. Results: There was a significant interaction (p < 0.001) between time of measurement and risk category. Comfort ratings of depicted situations with low and medium infection risk were higher during the second compared to the first survey period. Ratings of high-risk situations did not change significantly, although there was a tendency toward lower ratings during the pandemic. Multiple regression analyses showed that perceived probability of short-term infection could explain variance in the change of ratings of social situations with low- and medium risk, but not perceived probability of long-term infection or social factors. Conclusion: The results suggest that the change of participant's appraisal of the social situations during the COVID-19 pandemic relates to perceived infection risk. Both, the risk associated with the specific scenario as well as the general belief of short-term infection risk were associated with change. This change predominantly manifested in greater thought of comfort during low and medium risk situations, which might give a sense of safety during the pandemic. The finding that high-risk social situations were not rated as uncomfortable as expected must be considered with regard to the young sample and may not be generalizable to other individuals.

However, despite they represent the largest class of protein drug targets, a relatively small number high-resolution 3D structures have been obtained yet. Membrane protein biogenesis is more complex than that of the soluble proteins and its recombinant biosynthesis has been a major drawback, thus delaying their further structural characterization. Indeed, the major limitation in structure determination of MP is the low yield achieved in recombinant expression, usually coupled to low functionality, pinpointing the optimization target in recombinant MP research. Recently, the growing attention that have been dedicated to the upstream stage of MP bioprocesses allowed great advances, permitting the evolution of the number of MP solved structures. In this review, we analyse and discuss effective solutions and technical advances at the level of the upstream stage using prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms foreseeing an increase in expression yields of correctly folded MP and that may facilitate the determination of their three-dimensional structure. A section on techniques used to protein quality control and further structure determination of MP is also included.

An accumulating body of non-randomized evidence has recently been strengthened by the publication of two randomized studies comparing ultrahypofractionation with a normofractionated schedule, i.e., the Scandinavian HYPO-RT trial by Widmark et al. and the first toxicity results of the PACE‑B trial. In this review, we aim to give a brief overview of the current evidence of ultrahypofractionation, make an overall assessment of the level of evidence, and provide recommendations and requirements that should be followed before introducing ultrahypofractionation into routine clinical use.","Wolf, Frank; Sedlmayer, Felix; Aebersold, Daniel; Albrecht, Clemens; Böhmer, Dirk; Flentje, Michael; Ganswindt, Ute; Ghadjar, Pirus; Höcht, Stefan; Hölscher, Tobias; Müller, Arndt-Christian; Niehoff, Peter; Pinkawa, Michael; Schmidt-Hegemann, Nina-Sophie; Zamboglou, Constantinos; Zips, Daniel; Wiegel, Thomas",Strahlenther Onkol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00066-020-01723-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33301049/,101

With the onset of COVID-19 we have noticed an increase in the number of patients who have presented with new onset of complete smell loss to the senior author’s practice in Tehran, Iran. This anosmia and the frequency with which patients present is highly unusual. Coronaviruses have been known to cause common cold symptoms. COVID-19 infections have been described as causing more severe respiratory infections and the symptoms reported by authors from Wuhan, China have not specifically included anosmia. We describe patients who have presented during a two-week period of the COVID-19 pandemic with complete loss of sense of smell. Most had either no symptoms or mild respiratory symptoms. Many had a normal otolaryngologic exam. A relationship between COVID-19 and anosmia should be considered during the pandemic.

664923,Health-care guidelines and policies during the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico: A case of health-inequalities,2020-12-15,OBJECTIVES: Recruitment and retention of nurses in intensive care units (ICU) has been challenging over the last few years. Rising demand is now exacerbated by the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. Transition to ICU from other clinical areas is stressful resulting in significant nurse retention issues. This study therefore aimed to illuminate and explore new nurses' learning experiences in one large intensive care unit in the United Kingdom. METHODOLOGY/METHODS: Exploratory qualitative case study utilising two data collection methods: one to one interview with six new ICU nurses and focus groups with six senior/clinical education ICU nurses. SETTING: A large major trauma centre in London with over ninety ICU beds. FINDINGS: Findings indicate that ICU is a challenging learning environment for new nurses due to the large number of skills which must be developed in a short period of time. Forming supportive social relationships proved important in helping new ICU nurses learn and adapt to this complex clinical environment. The high-risk culture of ICU makes it harder to learn particularly for internationally educated nurses. Frequently changing shift patterns also impacts learning. CONCLUSION: Senior ICU nurses should be aware of the issues affecting new nurses and where possible alleviate the stress of working in this challenging environment. They should also consider individual circumstances whilst maintaining high quality education. Social support should be facilitated where possible and new nurses need to be aware of the realities of ICU work.,"Stewart, Carolyne",Intensive Crit Care Nurs,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.iccn.2021.103094; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34266733/,101

Here we report the development and evaluation of Fc-optimized anti-SARS-CoV-2 mAbs with superior potency to prevent or treat COVID-19 disease. In several animal models of COVID-19 disease6,7, we demonstrate that selective engagement of activating FcÎ³Rs results in improved efficacy in both preventing and treating disease-induced weight loss and mortality, significantly reducing the dose required to confer full protection upon SARS-CoV-2 challenge and treatment of pre-infected animals. Our results highlight the importance of FcÎ³R pathways in driving antibody-mediated antiviral immunity, while excluding any pathogenic or disease-enhancing effects of FcÎ³R engagement of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies upon infection. These findings have important implications for the development of Fc-engineered mAbs with optimal Fc effector function and improved clinical efficacy against COVID-19 disease.","Yamin, Rachel; Jones, Andrew T; Hoffmann, Hans-Heinrich; Schäfer, Alexandra; Kao, Kevin S; Francis, Rebecca L; Sheahan, Timothy P; Baric, Ralph S; Rice, Charles M; Ravetch, Jeffrey V; Bournazos, Stylianos",Nature (Lond.),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34547765/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-04017-w,101

The aim of the study was to describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of the cases diagnosed in the major pediatric tertiary hospital of Athens, where 26.5% of national pediatric measles cases were diagnosed and treated. METHODS: This is a retrospective study of children 0–16 years old, who presented at the emergency department and/or were hospitalized with clinical presentation compatible with measles and diagnosis was confirmed with molecular detection of the measles RNA in pharyngeal swabs. Epidemiological, clinical and laboratory characteristics were retrieved from medical records and analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 578 children with measles were identified during the study period. 322 (55.7%) were male with median age 36 months (range:1–193), while the largest number of documented cases (251; 43.4%) were children aged 1–5 years. Most children (429/578; 74.2%) belonged to the Roma minority and only 64 (11.1%) had Greek origin. 497 (91.5%) children were unvaccinated and 37 (6.8%) were partially vaccinated with measles vaccine. Hospitalization was required for 342 (59.2%) children, whereas one or more complications were reported in 230 (67.2%) of them. Most frequent complications were elevated transaminases (139; 40.6%), acute otitis media (72; 21%), dehydration (67; 19.6%) and pneumonia (58; 16.9%). 11 children (3.2%) required intensive care admission for altered mental status/status epilepticus (3), sepsis (2) and ARDS (6). 119/342 (34.8%) children were treated with antibiotics because of possible or confirmed bacterial coinfection. One death was reported, concerning an 11-month-old unvaccinated infant, with underlying dystrophy, who died of sepsis. CONCLUSION: Measles is not an innocent viral infection, as it is still characterized by high morbidity and complications rates. Unvaccinated or partially vaccinated populations could trigger new outbreaks, resulting in significant cost in public health. To avoid future measles outbreaks, high vaccination coverage should be achieved, as well as closing immunity gaps in the population and ensuring high-quality measles surveillance.","Gianniki, Maria; Siahanidou, Tania; Botsa, Evanthia; Michos, Athanasios",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33471833/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0245512,101

Post treatment samples from the same patients, taken during symptom resolution, identified recovery-associated immune features including increased monocyte CD163 levels, emergence of a new population of immature neutrophils and, in some patients, transiently increased plasma arginase. Plasma profiling identified multiple features shared by MIS-C, Kawasaki Disease and COVID-19 and that therapeutic inhibition of IL6 may be preferable to IL1 or TNF-α . We identified several potential mechanisms of action for IVIG, the most commonly used drug to treat MIS-C.

This study examined urban and non-urban inequalities in health services among COVID-19 patients aged 65 years or above in Florida, USA, from 2 March to 27 May 2020. METHODS: A retrospective time series analysis was conducted using individual patient records. Multivariable Poisson’s and logistic models were used to calculate adjusted incidence of COVID-19 and the associated rates of emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and deaths. RESULTS: As of 27 May 2020, there were 13,659 elderly COVID-19 patients (people aged 65 years or above) in Florida and 14.9% of them died. Elderly people living in small metropolitan areas might be less likely to be confirmed with COVID-19 infection than those living in large metropolitan areas. The emergency department visit and hospitalization rates decreased significantly across metropolitan statuses for both men and women. Those patients living in small metropolitan or rural areas were less likely to be hospitalized than those living in large metropolitan areas (35% and 34% vs 41%). Elderly women aged 75 years or above living in rural areas had 113% higher adjusted incidence of COVID-19 than those living in large metropolitan areas, and the rates of hospitalizations were lower compared with those counterparts living in large metropolitan areas (29% vs 46%; odds ratio: 0.37 (0.25–0.54), p < 0.001).

Anticoagulation has been proposed as therapy to decrease mortality, often adjusted for illness severity. Objective We wanted to investigate whether anticoagulation improves survival in COVID-19 and if this improvement in survival is associated with disease severity. Methods This is a cohort study simulating an intention-to-treat clinical trial, by analyzing the effect on mortality of anticoagulation therapy chosen in the first 48 hours of hospitalization. We analyzed 3,625 COVID-19+ inpatients, controlling for age, gender, glomerular filtration rate, oxygen saturation, ventilation requirement, intensive care unit admission, and time period, all determined during the first 48 hours. Results Adjusted logistic regression analyses demonstrated a significant decrease in mortality with prophylactic use of apixaban (odds ratio [OR] 0.46, p = 0.001) and enoxaparin (OR = 0.49, p = 0.001). Therapeutic apixaban was also associated with decreased mortality (OR 0.57, p = 0.006) but was not more beneficial than prophylactic use when analyzed over the entire cohort or within D-dimer stratified categories. Higher D-dimer levels were associated with increased mortality ( p < 0.0001). When adjusted for these same comorbidities within D-dimer strata, patients with D-dimer levels < 1 µg/mL did not appear to benefit from anticoagulation while patients with D-dimer levels > 10 µg/mL derived the most benefit. There was no increase in transfusion requirement with any of the anticoagulants used. Conclusion We conclude that COVID-19+ patients with moderate or severe illness benefit from anticoagulation and that apixaban has similar efficacy to enoxaparin in decreasing mortality in this disease.","Billett, Henny H.; Reyes-Gil, Morayma; Szymanski, James; Ikemura, Kenji; Stahl, Lindsay R.; Lo, Yungtai; Rahman, Shafia; Gonzalez-Lugo, Jesus D.; Kushnir, Margarita; Barouqa, Mohammad; Golestaneh, Ladan; Bellin, Eran",Thromb Haemost,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33186991/; https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0040-1720978,101

670400,A framework for One Health research,2017-03-24,"Bovine herpesvirus-1 (BHV-1) is a major cause of respiratory tract diseases in cattle. Vaccination of cattle against BHV-1 is a high priority. A major concern of currently modified live BHV-1 vaccines is their ability to cause latent infection and subsequent reactivation resulting in many outbreaks. Thus, there is a need for alternative strategies. We generated two recombinant Newcastle disease viruses (NDVs) expressing the glycoprotein D (gD) of BHV-1 from an added gene. One recombinant, rLaSota/gDFL, expressed gD without any modification. The other recombinant, rLaSota/gDF, expressed a chimeric gD in which the ectodomain of gD was fused with the transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail of the NDV fusion F glycoprotein. Remarkably, the native gD expressed by rLaSota/gDFL virus was incorporated into the NDV virion 2.5-fold more efficiently than the native NDV proteins, whereas the chimeric gD was not detectably incorporated even though it was abundantly expressed on the infected cell surface. The expression of gD did not increase the virulence of the rNDV vectors in chickens. A single intranasal and intratracheal inoculation of calves with either recombinant NDV elicited mucosal and systemic antibodies specific to BHV-1, with the responses to rLaSota/gDFL being higher than those to rLaSota/gDF. Following challenge with BHV-1, calves immunized with the recombinant NDVs had lower titers and earlier clearance of challenge virus compared to the empty vector control, and reduced disease was observed with rLaSota/gDFL. Following challenge, the titers of serum antibodies specific to BHV-1 were higher in the animals immunized with the rNDV vaccines compared to the rNDV parent virus, indicating that the vaccines primed for secondary responses. Our data suggest that NDV can be used as a vaccine vector in bovines and that BHV-1 gD may be useful in mucosal vaccine against BHV-1 infection, but might require augmentation by a second dose or the inclusion of additional BHV-1 antigens.","Khattar, Sunil K.; Collins, Peter L.; Samal, Siba K.",Vaccine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2010.02.051; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X10002197; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20189484/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X10002197; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3428038?pdf=render,101

We describe a 16‐year old male and a 64‐year old female recently lung transplanted patients with COVID‐19 during inpatient rehabilitation. Both patients were on triple immunosuppressive therapy and had no signs of allograft dysfunction. Both patients had close contact to a person who developed COVID‐19 and were tested positive for SARS‐CoV‐2. Subsequently, both patients underwent systematic screening and SARS‐CoV‐2 was detected ultimately. While the 16‐year old boy was completely asymptomatic, the 64‐year old woman developed only mild COVID‐19. Immunosuppressive therapy was unchanged and no experimental treatment was initiated. No signs of graft involvement or dysfunction were noticed.

673645,Essential Emergency and Critical Care: a consensus among global clinical experts,2021-09-21,"BACKGROUND: About 15 million people worldwide were affected by the Sars-Cov-2 infection, which already caused 600,000 deaths. This virus is mainly transmitted through exhalations from the airways of infected persons, so that Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems might play a role in increasing or reducing the spreading of the infection in indoor environments. METHODS: We modelled the role of HVAC systems in the diffusion of the contagion through Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations of cough at the “Bambino Gesù” Vatican State Children’s Hospital. Both waiting and hospital rooms were modeled as indoor scenarios. A specific Infection-Index (η) parameter was used to estimate the amount of contaminated air inhaled by each person present in the simulated indoor scenarios. The potential role of exhaust air ventilation systems placed above the coughing patient’s mouth was also assessed. RESULTS: Our CFD-based simulations of the waiting room show that HVAC air-flow remarkably enhances infected droplets diffusion in the whole indoor environment within 25 seconds from the cough event, despite the observed dilution of saliva particles containing the virus. At the same time also their number is reduced due to removal through the HVAC system or deposition on the surfaces. The proper use of Local Exhaust Ventilation systems (LEV) simulated in the hospital room was associated to a complete reduction of infected droplets spreading from the patient’s mouth in the first 0.5 seconds following the cough event. In the hospital room, the use of LEV system completely reduced the η index computed for the patient hospitalized at the bed next to the spreader, with a decreased possibility of contagion. CONCLUSIONS: CFD-based simulations for indoor environment can be useful to optimize air conditioning flow and to predict the contagion risk both in hospitals/ambulatories and in other public/private settings.","Borro, Luca; Mazzei, Lorenzo; Raponi, Massimiliano; Piscitelli, Prisco; Miani, Alessandro; Secinaro, Aurelio",Environ Res,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935120312408?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0013935120312408; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2020.110343; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33068577/,101

The physiopathology of human SARS-CoV-2 has not been completely understood, but its pathogenesis has been linked to a disproportionate response of the immune system. Just as described for SARS and MERS, an uncontrolled systemic inflammatory response, known as cytokine release syndrome (CRS) was observed in severe COVID-19 patients. It results from the release by immune and non-immune effector cells of substantial amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines and appears to contribute to SARS-CoV-2 pulmonary inflammation and extensive lung damage. In addition, hyper-coagulation and thrombosis resulted from the important release of pro-inflammatory cytokines contribute to the lethality of subjects severely infected with SARS-CoV-2. It is therefore essential to have a deep understanding of the various cytokines involved in this exacerbated immune response, and that could be targeted by potential immunological treatments. The aim of this review was to gather the current knowledge about the role of pro-inflammatory cytokines, namely IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-17 and TNFα in SARS-CoV-2 CRS, the probable causes and clinical outcomes of this phenomenon in severe cases of COVID-19.","Darif, Dounia; Hammi, Ikram; Kihel, Ayyoub; El Idrissi Saik, Imane; Guessous, Fadila; Akarid, Khadija",Microb Pathog,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2021.104799; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0882401021000711; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33609650/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0882401021000711?v=s5,101
674123,"An Observational Study in Manipur State, India on Preventive Behavior Influenced by Social Media During the COVID-19 Pandemic Mediated by Cyberchondria and Information Overload",2020-12-01,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causal agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), first emerged in Wuhan, China. The clinical manifestations of patients infected with COVID-19 include fever, cough, and dyspnea, up to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute cardiac injury. Thus, a lot of severe patients had to be admitted to intensive care units (ICU). The pathogenic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection are mediated by the binding of SARS-CoV-2 spikes to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor. The overexpression of human ACE-2 is associated with the disease severity in SARS-CoV-2 infection, demonstrating that viral entry into cells is a pivotal step. Although the lung is the organ that is most commonly affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection, acute kidney injury (AKI), heart dysfunction and abdominal pain are the most commonly reported co-morbidities of COVID-19. The occurrence of AKI in COVID-19 patients might be explained by several mechanisms that include viral cytopathic effects in renal cells and the host hyperinflammatory response. In addition, kidney dysfunction could exacerbate the inflammatory response started in the lungs and might cause further renal impairment and multi-organ failure. Mounting recent evidence supports the involvement of cardiovascular complications and endothelial dysfunction in COVID-19 syndrome, in addition to respiratory disease. To date, there is no vaccine, and no specific antiviral medicine has been shown to be effective in preventing or treating COVID-19. The removal of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the shutdown of the cytokine storm could ameliorate the clinical outcome in severe COVID-19 cases. Therefore, several interventions that inhibit viral replication and the systemic inflammatory response could modulate the severity of the renal dysfunction and increase the probability of a favorable outcome.","Stasi, Alessandra; Castellano, Giuseppe; Ranieri, Elena; Infante, Barbara; Stallone, Giovanni; Gesualdo, Loreto; Netti, Giuseppe Stefano",J Clin Med,https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm9124057; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33334050/,101

The aim of the present study was to examine the relations among religiosity, meaning-making, fear of COVID-19, and subjective well-being within a moderated mediation model. Three hundred and sixteen late adolescents (173 women and 143 men) in Poland volunteered to take part in the study. The results show that meaning-making mediated relationships between religiosity and life satisfaction, religiosity and positive affect, and religiosity and negative affect. In addition, these mediation effects were moderated by the fear of COVID-19. Specifically, the indirect effects were stronger for adolescents with high fear than for those with low fear, which indicates that fear of COVID-19 serves as a ‘warning’ factor.","Krok, Dariusz; Zarzycka, Beata; Telka, Ewa",J Relig Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34417950/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10943-021-01375-7,101
675812,Urban citizen health risk assessment for epidemic pneumonia and research on innovation on economic development.,2021-07-17,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is a new human-infecting coronavirus for which the World Health Organization declared a global pandemic. The first Italian cases occurred in February 2020: since then, there has been an exponential increase in new cases, hospitalizations and intensive care assistance demand. This new and sudden scenario led to a forced National Health System reorganization and review of welfare priorities. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of this pandemic on ordinary activities in two plastic surgery divisions in Rome, hosted in a COVID-19 and a non-COVID-19 hospital. METHODS: The data of this comparative retrospective study was collected between 9 March and 9 April 2019 and the same period of 2020 from two plastic surgery units, one in a COVID-19 hospital and second in a non-COVID-19 hospital in Rome, Italy. The 2019–2020 data of the two hospitals was compared regarding the number of surgeries, post-operative dressings and first consultations performed. RESULTS: Both units sustained a decrease in workload due to lockdown effects. Statistically significant differences for day surgery procedures (p value = 0.0047) and first consultations (p value < 0.0001) were found between the COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 institutes, with a drastic trend limiting non-urgent access to COVID-19 hospitals. CONCLUSIONS: The long-term effects of healthcare reshuffling in the “COVID-19 era” imply a delay in the diagnosis and treatment of skin cancer and cancellation of many reconstructive procedures. These findings pose a question on the future consequences of a long-term limitation in plastic surgery healthcare.

This phenomenon may be partly due to regional variations in health-related behaviours, some of which may be influenced by health anxiety. A functional polymorphism of the catechol O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene, designated rs4680 or Val(158)Met, has been associated with anxiety-related behaviours and the so-called ""worrier"" phenotype. Methods In this exploratory study, an analysis of the correlation between the frequencies of the Met allele of the COMT gene across 28 countries, obtained from the public domain Allele Frequency Database (ALFRED), and the COVID-19 prevalence and mortality rates in these countries, obtained from the Johns Hopkins Medical University web-based dashboard, was carried out while controlling for population size and median age in each country. Results Allele frequencies varied widely across populations. Met allele frequency was positively correlated with COVID-19 prevalence (ρ = 0.527, p = 0.004) and mortality rate (ρ = 0.542, p = 0.003) across nations. However, this correlation was no longer significant after controlling for confounders. Conclusions These preliminary results suggest that there may be a relationship between the COMT Val(158)Met or rs4680 functional polymorphism and the impact of COVID-19 across nations, which could plausibly be mediated by maladaptive anxiety-related behaviours.","Rajkumar, Ravi P",Cureus,https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.10103; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32879833/,101

Here, using a myeloid-cell receptor-focused ectopic expression screen, we identified several C-type lectins (DC-SIGN, L-SIGN, LSECtin, ASGR1, and CLEC10A) and Tweety family member 2 (TTYH2) as glycan-dependent binding partners of the SARS-CoV-2 spike. Except for TTYH2, these molecules primarily interacted with spike via regions outside of the receptor-binding domain. Single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis of pulmonary cells from COVID-19 patients indicated predominant expression of these molecules on myeloid cells. Although these receptors do not support active replication of SARS-CoV-2, their engagement with virus induced robust proinflammatory responses in myeloid cells that correlated with COVID-19 severity. We also generated a bispecific anti-spike nanobody that not only blocked ACE2-mediated infection but also the myeloid receptors-mediated proinflammatory responses. Our findings suggest SARS-CoV-2-myeloid receptor interactions promote immune hyper-activation, which represents potential targets for COVID-19 therapy.","Lu, Qiao; Liu, Jia; Zhao, Shuai; Gomez Castro, Maria Florencia; Laurent-Rolle, Maudry; Dong, Jianbo; Ran, Xiaojuan; Damani-Yokota, Payal; Tang, Hongzhen; Karakousi, Triantafyllia; Son, Juhee; Kaczmarek, Maria E.; Zhang, Ze; Yeung, Stephen T.; McCune, Broc T.; Chen, Rita E.; Tang, Fei; Ren, Xianwen; Chen, Xufeng; Hsu, Jack C.C.; Teplova, Marianna; Huang, Betty; Deng, Haijing; Long, Zhilin; Mudianto, Tenny; Jin, Shumin; Lin, Peng; Du, Jasper; Zang, Ruochen; Su, Tina Tianjiao; Herrera, Alberto; Zhou, Ming; Yan, Renhong; Cui, Jia; Zhu, James; Zhou, Qiang; Wang, Tao; Ma, Jianzhu; Koralov, Sergei B.; Zhang, Zemin; Aifantis, Iannis; Segal, Leopoldo N.; Diamond, Michael S.; Khanna, Kamal M.; Stapleford, Kenneth A.; Cresswell, Peter; Liu, Yue; Ding, Siyuan; Xie, Qi; Wang, Jun",Immunity,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1074761321002120; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34048708/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1074761321002120?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.immuni.2021.05.006,101

678918,The Perfect Storm: Coronavirus (Covid-19) Pandemic Meets Overfat Pandemic,2020-04-23,"BACKGROUND: Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing is a crucial strategy for HIV prevention. HIV testing rates remain low among men who have sex with men (MSM) in China. Digital network-based secondary distribution is considered as an effective model to enhance HIV self-testing (HIVST) among key populations. Digital platforms provide opportunities for testers to apply for HIVST kits by themselves, and secondary distribution allows them to apply for multiple kits to deliver to their sexual partners or members within their social network. We describe a three-arm randomized controlled trial to examine the effect of monetary incentives and peer referral in promoting digital network-based secondary distribution of HIVST among MSM in China. METHODS: Three hundred MSM in China will be enrolled through a digital platform for data collection. The eligibility criteria include being biological male, 18 years of age or over, ever having had sex with another man, being able to apply for kits via the online platform, and being willing to provide personal telephone number for follow-up. Eligible participants will be randomly allocated into one of the three arms: standard secondary distribution arm, secondary distribution with monetary incentives arm, and secondary distribution with monetary incentives plus peer referral arm. Participants (defined as “index”) will distribute actual HIV self-test kits to members within their social network (defined as “alter”) or share referral links to encourage alters to apply HIV self-test kits by themselves. All index participants will be requested to complete a baseline survey and a 3-month follow-up survey. Both indexes and alters will complete a survey upon returning the results by taking a photo of the used kits with the unique identification number. DISCUSSION: HIV testing rates remain suboptimal among MSM in China. Innovative interventions are needed to further expand the uptake of HIV testing among key populations. The findings of the trial can provide scientific evidence and experience on promoting secondary distribution of HIVST to reach key populations who have not yet been covered by existing testing services.

680245,Disparities in Technology and Broadband Internet Access Across Rurality: Implications for Health and Education.,2021-07-14,"Identity as traditionally conceived in mainstream Western thought is focused on theory, representation, knowledge, subjectivity and is centrally important in the works of Emmanuel Levinas. His critique of Western culture and corresponding notion of identity at its foundations typically raises the question of the other. Alterity in Levinas indicates existence of something on its own account, in itself independently of the subject’s will or consciousness. The objectivity of alterity tells of the impossible evasion of signs from their destiny, which is the other. The implications involved in reading the signs of the other have contributed to reorienting semiotics in the direction of semioethics. In Levinas, the I-other relation is not reducible to abstract cognitive terms, to intellectual synthesis, to the subject-object relation, but rather tells of involvement among singularities whose distinctive feature is alterity, absolute alterity. Humanism of the other is a pivotal concept in Levinas overturning the sense of Western reason. It asserts human duties over human rights. Humanism of alterity privileges encounter with the other, responsibility for the other, over tendencies of the centripetal and egocentric orders that instead exclude the other. Responsibility allows for neither rest nor peace. The “properly human” is given in the capacity for absolute otherness, unlimited responsibility, dialogical intercorporeity among differences non-indifferent to each other, it tells of the condition of vulnerability before the other, exposition to the other. The State and its laws limit responsibility for the other. Levinas signals an essential contradiction between the primordial ethical orientation and the legal order. Justice involves comparing incomparables, comparison among singularities outside identity. Consequently, justice places limitations on responsibility, on unlimited responsibility which at the same time it presupposes as its very condition of possibility. The present essay is structured around the following themes: (1) Premiss; (2) Justice, uniqueness, and love; (3) Sign and language; (4) Dialogue and alterity; (5) Semiotic materiality; (6) Globalization and the trap of identity; (7) Human rights and rights of the other: for a new humanism; (8) Ethics; (9) The World; (10) Outside the subject; (11) Responsibility and Substitution; (12) The face; (13) Fear of the other; (14) Alterity and justice; (15) Justice and proximity; (16) Literary writing; (17) Unjust justice; (18) Caring for the other.","Petrilli, Susan",Int J Semiot Law,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34092932/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11196-021-09845-7,101

The increasing mortality has revealed its severity. It is important to distinguish severe patients and provide appropriate treatment and care to prevent damages. Diabetes is reported to be a common comorbidity in COVID-19 patients and associated with higher mortality. We attempted to clarify the relationship between diabetes and COVID-19 patients’ severity. AIM: To determine the role of type 2 diabetes in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: To study the relationship between diabetes and COVID-19, we retrospectively collected 61 patients’ data from a tertiary medical center in Wuhan. All the patients were diagnosed with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and admitted to the center from February 13 to March 1, 2020. Patients’ age, sex, laboratory tests, chest computed tomography findings, capillary blood glucose (BG), and treatments were collected and analyzed. Fisher exact test was used for categorical data. Univariate and multivariate logistic regressions were used to explore the relationship between clinical characteristics and patients’ severity. RESULTS: In the 61 patients, the comorbidity of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and heart diseases were 24.6% (15 out of 61), 37.7% (23 out of 61), and 11.5% (7 out of 61), respectively. The diabetic group was related to more invasive treatments (P = 0.02) and severe status (P = 0.003). In univariate logistic regression, histories of diabetes (OR = 7.13, P = 0.003), hypertension (OR = 3.41, P = 0.039), and hepatic dysfunction (OR = 7.69, P = 0.002) were predictors of patients’ severity while heart disease (OR = 4.21, P = 0.083) and large lung involvement (OR = 2.70, P = 0.093) also slightly exacerbated patients’ conditions. In the multivariate analysis, diabetes (OR = 6.29, P = 0.016) and hepatic dysfunction (OR = 5.88, P = 0.018) were risk factors for severe patients. Diabetic patients showed elevated BG in 61.7% of preprandial tests and 33.3% of postprandial tests, revealing the limited control of glycemia in COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSION: A history of type 2 diabetes is correlated with invasive treatments and severe status. Suboptimal glycemic control and hepatic dysfunction have negative effects on severity status and may lead to the exacerbation of COVID-19 patients.","Xu, Ming; Yang, Wen; Huang, Tao; Zhou, Jun",World J Diabetes,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33384770/; https://doi.org/10.4239/wjd.v11.i12.644,101

The tests were conducted in a flat in Warsaw during the restrictions imposed due to the COVID-19 lockdown. The results showed that OPC-N3 underestimates the PN (particle number concentration) by about 2–3 times compared to the AeroTrak8220. Subsequently, the OPC-N3 was compared with another low-cost sensor, the PMS5003. Both devices showed similar efficiency in PN estimation, whereas PM (particulate matter) concentration estimation differed significantly. Moreover, the relationship among the PM(1)–PM(2.5)–PM(10) readings obtained with the PMS5003 appeared improbably linear regarding the natural indoor conditions. The correlation of PM concentrations obtained with the PMS5003 suggests an oversimplified calculation method of PM. The studies also demonstrated that PM(1), PM(2.5), and PM(10) concentrations in the high- to low-occupancy rooms were about 3, 2, and 1.5 times, respectively. On the other hand, the use of an air purifier considerably reduced the PM concentrations to similar levels in both rooms. All the sensors showed that frying and toast-making were the major sources of particulate matter, about 10 times higher compared to average levels. Considerably lower particle levels were measured in the low-occupancy room.","Kaliszewski, Miron; Włodarski, Maksymilian; Młyńczak, Jarosław; Kopczyński, Krzysztof",Sensors (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/s20247290; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33353048/,101

Here we compare the outcomes of a cohort of rheumatic patients with a matched control cohort to identify potential risk factors for severe illness. Methods In this comparative cohort study, we identified hospital PCR+ COVID-19 rheumatic patients with chronic inflammatory arthritis (IA) or autoimmune/immunomediated diseases (AI/IMID). Non-rheumatic controls were randomly sampled 1:1, and matched by age, sex, and PCR date. The main outcome was severe COVID-19, defined as death, invasive ventilation, ICU admission, or serious complications. We assessed the association between the outcome and potential prognostic variables, adjusted by COVID treatment, using logistic regression. Results The cohorts were composed of 456 rheumatic and non-rheumatic patients, in equal numbers. Mean age was 63 [IQR 53-78] and male sex 41% in both cohorts. Rheumatic diseases were IA (60%) and AI/IMID (40%). Most patients (74%) had been hospitalised, and the risk of severe COVID was 31.6% in the rheumatic and 28.1% in the non-rheumatic cohort. Ageing, male sex and previous comorbidity (obesity, diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular, or lung disease) increased the risk in the rheumatic cohort by bivariate analysis. In logistic regression analysis, independent factors associated with severe COVID were increased age (OR 5.31; CI 3.14-8.95), male sex (2.13; CI 1.35-3.36) and having an AI/IMID (OR 1.98; CI 1.15-3.41).

In some countries, the rate of blood donation has reached lower than 30%. Accordingly, in this study, to fill the lack of blood product during COVID-19, especially at the outbreak’s peak, we propose a novel mechanism by providing a two-stage optimization tool for coordinating activities to mitigate the shortage in this urgent situation. In the first stage, a blood collection plan considering disruption risk in supply to minimize the unmet demand will be solved. Afterward, in the second stage, the collected units will be shared between regions by applying the capacity sharing concept to avoid the blood shortage in health centers. Moreover, to tackle the uncertainty and disruption risk, a novel stochastic model combining the mixed uncertainty approach is tailored. A rolling horizon planning method is implemented under an iterative procedure to provide and share the limited blood resources to solve the proposed model A real-world case study of Iran is investigated to examine the applicability and performance of the proposed model; it should be noted that the designed mechanism is not confined just to this case. Obtained computational results indicate the applicability of the model, the superior performance of the capacity sharing concept, and the effectiveness of the designed mechanism for mitigating the shortage and wastage during the COVID-19 outbreak.","Samani, Mohammad Reza Ghatreh; Hosseini-Motlagh, Seyyed-Mahdi",Appl Soft Comput,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34413713/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1568494621007420; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1568494621007420?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.asoc.2021.107821,101

RESULTS: In most cases, reports identified IPV that was occurring prior to the lockdown, but increased in severity or involved new types of violence during the lockdown. The case scenarios included descriptions of many forms of IPV commonly reported, including physical, economic, psychological and sexual violence, often concurrently. Several women also reported threats of being thrown out of their homes by perpetrators, which threatens women’s ability to protect themselves from exposure to COVID-19, but could also leave women stranded with no access to transportation, social services, or other resources during the lockdown. Several women also reported IPV that involved custody of children, as well as IPV that disrupted women’s income generation. IPV was also reported in relation to economic stressors associated with the lockdown. Reports highlight how the lockdown disrupted women’s social support, hindering accessibility of formal and informal sources of help. CONCLUSION: The lockdowns in Nigeria may have inadvertently placed women already experiencing partner violence at risk for experiencing more severe violence, new challenges to cope with violent experiences, and other forms of violence, including violence that used the lockdown as a way to threaten women’s security and ability to protect themselves from the virus. Hence, there is need for innovative approaches to support victims, with emphasis on ways in which perpetrators of IPV may be using the threat of COVID-19 to further gain power and control over partners.","Fawole, Olufunmilayo I.; Okedare, Omowumi O.; Reed, Elizabeth",BMC Womens Health,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12905-021-01177-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33472627/,101

Case 1: A 46-year-old-man with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) caused by COVID-19 infection was being administered favipiravir. Fentanyl, propofol, and rocuronium were also given. On day 3, midazolam administration was initiated for deep sedation. On day 5, his high body temperature increased to 41.2 °C, creatine kinase level elevated, and he developed tachycardia, tachypnea, altered consciousness, and diaphoresis. NMS was suspected, and supportive therapy was initiated. High-grade fever persisted for 4 days and subsided on day 9. Case 2: A 44-year-old-man with ARDS caused by COVID-19 infection was being treated with favipiravir. On day 5, risperidone was started for delirium. On day 7, his body temperature suddenly increased to 40.8 °C, his CK level elevated, and he developed tachycardia, tachypnea, altered consciousness, and diaphoresis. NMS diagnosis was confirmed, and both, favipiravir and risperidone were discontinued on day 8. On the same day, his CK levels decreased, and his body temperature normalized on day 9. Patients with COVID-19 infection frequently require deep sedation and develop delirium; therefore, more attention should be paid to the development of NMS in patients who are being administered such causative agents. The mechanism underlying the occurrence of NMS in COVID-19 patients treated with favipiravir remains unknown. Therefore, careful consideration of NMS development is necessary in the management of COVID-19 patients.","So, Mitsuhito; Hifumi, Toru; Isokawa, Shutaro; Shimizu, Masato; Otani, Norio; Ishimatsu, Shinichi",Am J Emerg Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32473756/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajem.2020.05.042; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0735675720303843?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0735675720303843,101
685578,Climate Change and Human Health Impacts in the United States: An Update on the Results of the U.S. National Assessment,2006-05-18,"Development of a safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is a public health priority. We designed subunit vaccine candidates using self-assembling ferritin nanoparticles displaying one of two multimerized SARS-CoV-2 spikes: full-length ectodomain (S-Fer) or a C-terminal 70 amino-acid deletion (SΔC-Fer). Ferritin is an attractive nanoparticle platform for production of vaccines and ferritin-based vaccines have been investigated in humans in two separate clinical trials. We confirmed proper folding and antigenicity of spike on the surface of ferritin by cryo-EM and binding to conformation-specific monoclonal antibodies. After a single immunization of mice with either of the two spike ferritin particles, a lentiviral SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus assay revealed mean neutralizing antibody titers at least 2-fold greater than those in convalescent plasma from COVID-19 patients. Additionally, a single dose of SΔC-Fer elicited significantly higher neutralizing responses as compared to immunization with the spike receptor binding domain (RBD) monomer or spike ectodomain trimer alone. After a second dose, mice immunized with SΔC-Fer exhibited higher neutralizing titers than all other groups. Taken together, these results demonstrate that multivalent presentation of SARS-CoV-2 spike on ferritin can notably enhance elicitation of neutralizing antibodies, thus constituting a viable strategy for single-dose vaccination against COVID-19.","Powell, Abigail E.; Zhang, Kaiming; Sanyal, Mrinmoy; Tang, Shaogeng; Weidenbacher, Payton A.; Li, Shanshan; Pham, Tho D.; Pak, John E.; Chiu, Wah; Kim, Peter S.",bioRxiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32869030/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.28.272518,101

686127,India’s syndemic of tuberculosis and COVID-19,2020-11-16,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: An effective treatment option is not yet available for SARS-CoV2, which causes the COVID-19 pandemic and whose effects are felt more and more every day. Ivermectin is among the drugs whose effectiveness in treatment has been investigated. In this study; it was aimed to investigate the presence of gene mutations that alter ivermectin metabolism and cause toxic effects in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia, and to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of ivermectin use in the treatment of patients without mutation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with severe COVID19 pneumonia were included in the study, which was planned as a prospective, randomized, controlled, single-blind phase 3 study. Two groups, the study group and the control group, took part in the study. Ivermectin 200 mcg/kg/day for 5 days in the form of a solution prepared for enteral use added to the reference treatment protocol -hydroxychloroquine + favipiravir + azithromycin- of patients included in the study group. Patients in the control group were given only reference treatment with 3 other drugs without ivermectin. The presence of mutations was investigated by performing sequence analysis in the mdr1/abcab1 gene with the Sanger method in patients included in the study group according to randomization. Patients with mutations were excluded from the study and ivermectin treatment was not continued. Patients were followed for 5 days after treatment. At the end of the treatment and follow-up period, clinical response and changes in laboratory parameters were evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 66 patients, 36 in the study group and 30 in the control group were included in the study. Mutations affecting ivermectin metabolism was detected in genetic tests of six (16.7%) patients in the study group and they were excluded from the study. At the end of the 5-day follow-up period, the rate of clinical improvement was 73.3% (22/30) in the study group and was 53.3% (16/30) in the control group (p = 0.10). At the end of the study, mortality developed in 6 patients (20%) in the study group and in 9 (30%) patients in the control group (p = 0.37). At the end of the follow-up period, the average peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2) values of the study and control groups were found to be 93.5 and 93.0%, respectively. Partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2)/FiO2 ratios were determined as 236.3 ± 85.7 and 220.8 ± 127.3 in the study and control groups, respectively. While the blood lymphocyte count was higher in the study group compared to the control group (1698 ± 1438 and 1256 ± 710, respectively) at the end of the follow-up period (p = 0.24); reduction in serum C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin and D-dimer levels was more pronounced in the study group (p = 0.02, p = 0.005 and p = 0.03, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: According to the findings obtained, ivermectin can provide an increase in clinical recovery, improvement in prognostic laboratory parameters and a decrease in mortality rates even when used in patients with severe COVID-19. Consequently, ivermectin should be considered as an alternative drug that can be used in the treatment of COVID-19 disease or as an additional option to existing protocols.

686128,Protecting the world from infectious disease threats: now or never,2019-08-31,"PURPOSE: Fermented soybean foods (FSF) is popularly consumed in the South-East Asian countries. Bacillus species, a predominant microorganism present in these foods, have demonstrated beneficial and deleterious impacts on human health. These microorganisms produce bioactive compounds during fermentation that have beneficial impacts in improving human health. However, the health risks associated with FSF, food pathogens, biogenic amines (BAs) production, and late-onset anaphylaxis, remain a concern. The purpose of this review is to present an in-depth analysis of positive and negative impacts as a result of consumption of FSF along with the measures to alleviate health risks for human consumption. METHODS: This review was composed by scrutinizing contemporary literature of peer-reviewed publications related to Bacillus and FSF. Based on the results from academic journals, this review paper was categorized into FSF, role of Bacillus species in these foods, process of fermentation, beneficial, and adverse influence of these foods along with methods to improve food safety. Special emphasis was given to the potential benefits of bioactive compounds released during fermentation of soybean by Bacillus species. RESULTS: The nutritional and functional properties of FSF are well-appreciated, due to the release of peptides and mucilage, which have shown health benefits: in managing cardiac disease, gastric disease, cancer, allergies, hepatic disease, obesity, immune disorders, and especially microbial infections due to the presence of probiotic property, which is a potential alternative to antibiotics. Efficient interventions were established to mitigate pitfalls like the techniques to reduce BAs and food pathogens and by using a defined starter culture to improve the safety and quality of these foods. CONCLUSION: Despite some of the detrimental effects produced by these foods, potential health benefits have been observed. Therefore, soybean foods fermented by Bacillus can be a promising food by integrating effective measures for maintaining safety and quality for human consumption. Further, in vivo analysis on the activity and dietary interventions of bioactive compounds among animal models and human volunteers are yet to be achieved which is essential to commercialize them for safe consumption by humans, especially immunocompromised patients.","Gopikrishna, Trishala; Suresh Kumar, Harini Keerthana; Perumal, Kumar; Elangovan, Elavarashi",Ann Microbiol,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13213-021-01641-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34305497/,101

687336,"Urban areas, human health and technosols for the green deal",2021-05-04,"BACKGROUND: Respiratory RNA viruses including influenza virus have been a cause of health and economic hardships. These viruses depend on its host for replication and infection. Influenza virus infection is lethal to the chick embryo. We examined whether a combination of trimethoprim and zinc (Tri-Z), that acts on the host, can reduce the lethal effect of influenza A virus in chick embryo model. METHOD: Influenza virus was isolated from patients and propagated in eggs. We determined viral load that infects 50% of eggs (50% egg lethal dose, ELD(50)). We introduced 10 ELD(50) into embryonated eggs and repeated the experiments using 100 ELD(50). A mixture of zinc oxide (Zn) and trimethoprim (TMP) (weight/weight ratios ranged from 0.01 to 0.3, Zn/TMP with increment of 0.1) was tested for embryo survival of the infection (n = 12 per ratio, in triplicates). Embryo survival was determined by candling eggs daily for 7 days. Controls of Zn, TMP, saline or convalescent serum were conducted in parallel. The effect of Tri-Z on virus binding to its cell surface receptor was evaluated in a hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assay using chicken red cells. Tri-Z was prepared to concentration of 10 mg TMP and 1.8 mg Zn per ml, then serial dilutions were made. HAI effect was expressed as scores where ++++ = no effect; 0 = complete HAI effect. RESULTS: TMP, Zn or saline separately had no effect on embryo survival, none of the embryos survived influenza virus infection. All embryos treated with convalescent serum survived. Tri-Z, at ratio range of 0.15–0.2 (optimal ratio of 0.18) Zn/TMP, enabled embryos to survive influenza virus despite increasing viral load (> 80% survival at optimal ratio). At concentration of 15 µg/ml of optimal ratio, Tri-Z had total HAI effect (scored 0). However, at clinical concentration of 5 µg/ml, Tri-Z had partial HAI effect (+ +). CONCLUSION: Acting on host cells, Tri-Z at optimal ratio can reduce the lethal effect of influenza A virus in chick embryo. Tri-Z has HAI effect. These findings suggest that combination of trimethoprim and zinc at optimal ratio can be provided as treatment for influenza and possibly other respiratory RNA viruses infection in man.","El Habbal, Magdi H.",Virol J,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12985-021-01585-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34082750/,101
688470,COVID-19 Pandemic Underscores the Need to Address Social Isolation and Loneliness.,2021-09-29,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the potential impacts of successive lockdown-easing measures in England, at a point in the COVID-19 pandemic when community transmission levels were relatively high. DESIGN: We developed a Bayesian model to infer incident cases and reproduction number (R) in England, from incident death data. We then used this to forecast excess cases and deaths in multiple plausible scenarios in which R increases at one or more time points. SETTING: England. PARTICIPANTS: Publicly available national incident death data for COVID-19 were examined. PRIMARY OUTCOME: Excess cumulative cases and deaths forecast at 90 days, in simulated scenarios of plausible increases in R after successive easing of lockdown in England, compared with a baseline scenario where R remained constant. RESULTS: Our model inferred an R of 0.75 on 13 May when England first started easing lockdown. In the most conservative scenario modelled where R increased to 0.80 as lockdown was eased further on 1 June and then remained constant, the model predicted an excess 257 (95% CI 108 to 492) deaths and 26 447 (95% CI 11 105 to 50 549) cumulative cases over 90 days. In the scenario with maximal increases in R (but staying ≤1), the model predicts 3174 (95% CI 1334 to 6060) excess cumulative deaths and 421 310 (95% CI 177 012 to 804 811) cases. Observed data from the forecasting period aligned most closely to the scenario in which R increased to 0.85 on 1 June, and 0.9 on 4 July. CONCLUSIONS: When levels of transmission are high, even small changes in R with easing of lockdown can have significant impacts on expected cases and deaths, even if R remains ≤1. This will have a major impact on population health, tracing systems and healthcare services in England. Following an elimination strategy rather than one of maintenance of R ≤1 would substantially mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic within England.","Ziauddeen, Hisham; Subramaniam, Naresh; Gurdasani, Deepti",BMJ Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34497074/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-042483,101

We find that, although generally very pessimistic, a substantial proportion of individuals believes that their households’ economy will be doing substantially better than the national and global economy, suggesting a “financial better-than-average” effect. Furthermore, we find that the pessimism regarding future household economic situation and being financially ignorant are associated with decreased financial well-being, while the (inter)national economic situation is not.
