491,491,491,Excess healthcare burden during 1918-1920 influenza pandemic in Taiwan: implications for post-pandemic preparedness,18.682964,2.197288,2011-01-17,"BACKGROUND: It is speculated that the 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus might fall into a seasonal pattern during the current post-pandemic period with more severe clinical presentation for high-risk groups identified during the 2009 pandemic. Hence the extent of likely excess healthcare needs during this period must be fully considered. We will make use of the historical healthcare record in Taiwan during and after the 1918 influenza pandemic to ascertain the scope of potential excess healthcare burden during the post-pandemic period. METHODS: To establish the healthcare needs after the initial wave in 1918, the yearly healthcare records (hospitalizations, outpatients, etc.) in Taiwan during 1918-1920 are compared with the corresponding data from the adjacent ""baseline"" years of 1916, 1917, 1921, and 1922 to estimate the excess healthcare burden during the initial outbreak in 1918 and in the years immediately after. RESULTS: In 1918 the number of public hospital outpatients exceeded the yearly average of the baseline years by 20.11% (95% CI: 16.43, 25.90), and the number of hospitalizations exceeded the corresponding yearly average of the baseline years by 12.20% (10.59, 14.38), while the excess number of patients treated by the public medics was statistically significant at 32.21% (28.48, 39.82) more than the yearly average of the baseline years. For 1920, only the excess number of hospitalizations was statistically significant at 19.83% (95% CI: 17.21, 23.38) more than the yearly average of the baseline years. CONCLUSIONS: Considerable extra burden with significant loss of lives was reported in 1918 by both the public medics system and the public hospitals. In comparison, only a substantial number of excess hospitalizations in the public hospitals was reported in 1920, indicating that the population was relatively unprepared for the first wave in 1918 and did not fully utilize the public hospitals. Moreover, comparatively low mortality was reported by the public hospitals and the public medics during the second wave in 1920 even though significantly more patients were hospitalized, suggesting that there had been substantially less fatal illnesses among the hospitalized patients during the second wave. Our results provide viable parameters for assessing healthcare needs for post-pandemic preparedness.","Hsieh, Ying-Hen; Chan, Chi-Ho",BMC Public Health,198,30
1548,1548,1548,Usage of Social Media and Smartphone Application in Assessment of Physical and Psychological Well-Being of Individuals in Times of a Major Air Pollution Crisis,18.559523,2.3802068,2014-03-25,"BACKGROUND: Crisis situations bring about many challenges to researchers, public institutions, and governments in collecting data and conducting research in affected individuals. Recent developments in Web-based and smartphone technologies have offered government and nongovernment organizations a new system to disseminate and acquire information. However, research into this area is still lacking. The current study focuses largely on how new social networking websites and, in particular, smartphone technologies could have helped in the acquisition of crucial research data from the general population during the recent 2013 Southeast Asian Haze. This crisis lasted only for 1 week, and is unlike other crisis where there are large-scale consequential after-effects. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether respondents will make use of Internet, social media, and smartphone technologies to provide feedback regarding their physical and psychological wellbeing during a crisis, and if so, will these new mechanisms be as effective as conventional, technological, Internet-based website technologies. METHODS: A Web-based database and a smartphone application were developed. Participants were recruited by snowball sampling. The participants were recruited either via a self-sponsored Facebook post featuring a direct link to the questionnaire on physical and psychological wellbeing and also a smartphone Web-based application; or via dissemination of the questionnaire link by emails, directed to the same group of participants. Information pertaining to physical and psychological wellbeing was collated. RESULTS: A total of 298 respondents took part in the survey. Most of them were between the ages of 20 to 29 years and had a university education. More individuals preferred the option of accessing and providing feedback to a survey on physical and psychological wellbeing via direct access to a Web-based questionnaire. Statistical analysis showed that demographic variables like age, gender, and educational levels did not influence the mechanism of access. In addition, the participants reported a mean number of 4.03 physical symptoms (SD 2.6). The total Impact of Event Scale–Revised (IES-R) score was 18.47 (SD 11.69), which indicated that the study population did experience psychological stress but not post-traumatic stress disorder. The perceived dangerous Pollutant Standards Index (PSI) level and the number of physical symptoms were associated with higher IES-R Score (P<.05). CONCLUSIONS: This is one of the first few studies demonstrating the use of Internet in data collection during an air-pollution crisis. Our results demonstrated that the newer technological modalities have the potential to acquire data, similar to that of conventional technologies. Demographic variables did not influence the mechanism of usage. In addition, our findings also suggested that there are acute physical and psychological impacts on the population from an air-pollution crisis.","Zhang, Melvyn WB; Ho, Cyrus SH; Fang, Pan; Lu, Yanxia; Ho, Roger CM",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,198,1

METHODS: A series of 18 patients in the state of São Paulo, Brazil is described. All patients were consecutively evaluated by a multidisciplinary team at the hospital of origin. The patients were rescued, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support was provided on site. The patients were then transported to referral hospitals for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support. Data were retrieved from a prospectively collected database. RESULTS: From 2011 to 2017, 18 patients aged 29 (25 - 31) years with a SAPS 3 of 84 (68 - 92) and main primary diagnosis of leptospirosis and influenza A (H1N1) virus were transported to three referral hospitals in São Paulo. A median distance of 39 (15 - 82) km was traveled on each rescue mission during a period of 360 (308 - 431) min. A median of one (0 - 2) nurse, three (2 - 3) physicians, and one (0 - 1) physical therapist was present per rescue. Seventeen rescues were made by ambulance, and one rescue was made by helicopter. The observed complications were interruption in the energy supply to the pump in two cases (11%) and oxygen saturation < 70% in two cases. Thirteen patients (72%) survived and were discharged from the hospital. Among the nonsurvivors, there were two cases of brain death, two cases of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, and one case of irreversible pulmonary fibrosis. CONCLUSIONS: Transportation with extracorporeal support occurred without serious complications, and the hospital survival rate was high.","Li, Ho Yeh; Mendes, Pedro Vitale; Melro, Livia Maria Garcia; Joelsons, Daniel; Besen, Bruno Adler Maccagnan Pinheiro; Costa, Eduardo Leite Viera; Hirota, Adriana Sayuri; Barbosa, Edzangela Vasconcelos Santos; Foronda, Flavia Krepel; Azevedo, Luciano Cesar Pontes; Romano, Thiago Gomes; Park, Marcelo",Rev Bras Ter Intensiva,198,1

Using a correlated biochemical and immunological approach, we have now shown that the 200K protein is under separate developmental control during rat brain differentiation and that the time of its expression differs in different regions. We were unable to detect 200K protein by immunofluorescence or in total brain filament preparations from prenatal rat brain, although the 145K and 68K proteins are both present in an apparently identical distribution. During development, progressively more 145K- and 68K-positive neurofilamentous bundles can be stained with 200K antibodies, paralleling the increasing quantities of this protein detected biochemically in brain filament preparations. We conclude that 200K protein probably has a more specialized role in neurofilament architecture and function than the other two triplet proteins.","Shaw, Gerry; Weber, Klaus",Nature,198,5

We evaluated whether social media reflects social uneasiness and fear during epidemic outbreaks and natural catastrophes. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Freely available epidemic data in Taiwan. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: We used weekly epidemic incidence data obtained from the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control and online search query data obtained from Google Trends between 4 October 2015 and 2 April 2016. To validate whether non-English query keywords were useful surveillance tools, we estimated the correlation between online query data and epidemic incidence in Taiwan. RESULTS: With our approach, we noted that keywords 感冒 (‘common cold’), 發燒 (‘fever’) and 咳嗽 (‘cough’) exhibited good to excellent correlation between Google Trends query data and influenza incidence (r=0.898, p<0.001; r=0.773, p<0.001; r=0.796, p<0.001, respectively). They also displayed high correlation with influenza-like illness emergencies (r=0.900, p<0.001; r=0.802, p<0.001; r=0.886, p<0.001, respectively) and outpatient visits (r=0.889, p<0.001; r=0.791, p<0.001; r=0.870, p<0.001, respectively). We noted that the query 腸病毒 (‘enterovirus’) exhibited excellent correlation with the number of enterovirus-infected patients in emergency departments (r=0.914, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggested that Google Trends can be a good surveillance tool for epidemic outbreaks, even in Taiwan, the non-English-speaking country. Online search activity indicates that people are concerned about epidemic diseases, even if they do not visit hospitals. This prompted us to develop useful tools to monitor social media during an epidemic because such media usage reflects infectious disease trends more quickly than does traditional reporting.","Chang, Yu-Wei; Chiang, Wei-Lun; Wang, Wen-Hung; Lin, Chun-Yu; Hung, Ling-Chien; Tsai, Yi-Chang; Suen, Jau-Ling; Chen, Yen-Hsu",BMJ Open,198,24
12145,12145,12145,Pandemic Pause: Lessons in Unscrambling My Daily Life,18.518023,2.1522543,2020-07-28,"The exercise pressor reflex arises from contracting muscle and is manifested by increases in arterial pressure, heart rate, and cardiac contractility. In patients with peripheral artery disease, the exercise pressor reflex is exaggerated. This effect is believed to be caused by a metabolite whose concentration is increased when the working muscles are inadequately perfused. Previous work in rats with simulated peripheral artery disease has shown that pharmacological blockade of acid-sensing ion channel 3 (ASIC3), which is found on group III and IV afferents, prevented the exaggeration of the exercise pressor reflex. Blockade of ASIC3, however, may have off-target effects that preclude a conclusion that ASIC3 plays a role in evoking the reflex in rats with simulated peripheral artery disease. In the present experiments performed in decerebrated rats with simulated peripheral artery disease, we compared the exercise pressor reflex in rats with a functional knockout of the ASIC3 (KO) with the reflex in their wild-type counterparts (WT). We found that the exercise pressor reflex in ASIC3 KO rats was significantly lower than the exercise pressor reflex in their WT counterparts (P < 0.05). ASIC 3 KO rats demonstrated lower pressor responses to intra‐arterial injection of diprotonated phosphate (86 mM; pH 6.0), lactic acid (12 mM; pH 2.85), and capsaicin (0.2 μg; pH 7.2) (P < 0.05). In contrast, both ligated WT and ASIC3 KO rats displayed similar pressor responses to tendon stretch (P > 0.05). We conclude that ASIC3 play an important role in evoking the exaggerated exercise pressor reflex in rats with peripheral artery disease. NEW & NOTEWORTHY We used a genetic approach to test the hypothesis that the magnitude of the exercise pressor reflex evoked in ligated ASIC3 KO rats was significantly lower than the magnitude of the exercise pressor reflex evoked in their ligated wild-type (WT) counterparts. The pressor response to contraction in ligated ASIC3 KO rats was significantly smaller than was the pressor response to contraction in ligated WT rats.","Kim, Joyce S.; Ducrocq, Guillaume P.; Kaufman, Marc P.",Am J Physiol Heart Circ Physiol,198,22

While the former two subtypes are associated with an increased risk of developing gastric intestinal adenocarcinoma, the latter subtype is not. In this study, we evaluated the capability to classify common gastritis subtypes using convolutional neuronal networks on a small dataset of antrum and corpus biopsies. Methods: 1230 representative 500 × 500 µm images of 135 patients with type A, type B, and type C gastritis were extracted from scanned histological slides. Patients were allocated randomly into a training set (60%), a validation set (20%), and a test set (20%). One classifier for antrum and one classifier for corpus were trained and optimized. After optimization, the test set was analyzed using a joint result from both classifiers. Results: Overall accuracy in the test set was 84% and was particularly high for type B gastritis with a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 93%. Conclusions: Classification of gastritis subtypes is possible using convolutional neural networks on a small dataset of histopathological images of antrum and corpus biopsies. Deep learning strategies to support routine diagnostic pathology merit further evaluation.","Steinbuss, Georg; Kriegsmann, Katharina; Kriegsmann, Mark",Int J Mol Sci,198,5

In 2019, the country witnessed the worst ever dengue outbreak. The present study was conducted to characterize the socio-economic factors and knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) status towards dengue among the people of Bangladesh. METHOD: A cross-sectional study was conducted with 1,010 randomly selected respondents from nine different administrative regions of Bangladesh between July and November 2019. A structured questionnaire was used covering socio-demographic characteristics of the participants including their knowledge, awareness, treatment and practices regarding dengue fever. Factors associated with the knowledge and awareness of dengue were investigated separately, using multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: Although majority (93.8%) of the respondents had heard about dengue, however, they had still misconceptions about Aedes breeding habitat. Around half of the study population (45.7%) had mistaken belief that Aedes can breed in dirty water and 43.1% knew that Aedes mosquito usually bites around sunrise and sunset. Fever indication was found in 36.6% of people which is the most common symptom of dengue. Among the socio-demographic variables, the level of education of the respondents was identified as an independent predictor for both knowledge (p<0.05) and awareness (p<0.05) of dengue. The preventive practice level was moderately less than the knowledge level though there was a significant association (p<0.05) existed between knowledge and preventive practices. Our study noted that TV/Radio is an effective predominant source of information about dengue fever. CONCLUSION: As dengue is emerging in Bangladesh, there is an urgent need to increase health promotion activities through campaigns for eliminating the misconception and considerable knowledge gaps about dengue.","Hossain, Md.

We simulated the dispersion process of the droplets with initial diameter of 100 μm, 10 μm and gaseous contaminant in unidirectional ventilated protective isolation room and studied the droplets dispersion and cross transmission with different sizes. The droplets with initial size of 100 μm settle out of the coughing jet quickly after coming out from mouth and cannot be carried by the coughing jet to the human thermal plume affecting (HTPA) zone of the susceptible manikin. Hence, the larger droplets disperse mainly in the HTPA zone of the source manikin, and the droplets cross transmission between source manikin and susceptible manikin is very small. The droplets with initial size of 10 μm and gaseous contaminant have similar dispersion but different removal process in the UVPIR. Part of the droplets with initial size of 10 μm and gaseous contaminant that are carried by the higher velocity coughing airflow can enter the HTPA zone of the susceptible manikin and disperse around it. The other part cannot spread to the susceptible manikin’s HTPA zone and mainly spread in the source manikin’s HTPA zone.

Since roughly the year 2000, the World Health Organization has collaborated with a large number of local actors and made a concentrated effort to protect the world’s population against emerging infectious diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), swine flu, Ebola and Zika. Although efforts have been made so that the spread of future infectious diseases will be contained through early intervention, the actors in charge anticipate that the extant measures will fail to some degree. They believe it is simply impossible to prevent all pandemics from happening. But steps can and should be taken to lessen the impact of an unavoidable pandemic through emergency preparation. This chapter deals with organizations and organizational networks as key actors in these processes of emergency planning. Without the capacity of organizations to produce binding decisions for their members, which makes planning for an uncertain future possible, pandemic preparedness would not be feasible—especially not on a global scale.","Leanza, Matthias",How Organizations Manage the Future,198,5

Automatically supporting this task is challenging; most existing methods assume high similarity of variants which limits reuse of the generated domain artifacts, or provide very low-level features rather than actual domain features. As a result, these methods are limited in handling common scenarios such as similarly behaving systems developed by different teams, or merging existing products. To address this gap, we propose a method for extracting domain knowledge in the form of domain behaviors, building on a previously developed framework for behavior-based variability analysis among class operations. Machine learning techniques are applied for identifying clusters of operations that can potentially form domain behaviors. The approach is evaluated on a set of open-source video games, named apo-games.","Reinhartz-Berger, Iris; Abbas, Sameh",Advanced Information Systems Engineering,198,11

We found that the dry heat generated by an electric cooker (100 °C, 5% relative humidity, 50 min) effectively inactivated Tulane virus (TV, >5.2-log(10) reduction), rotavirus (RV, >6.6-log(10) reduction), adenovirus (AdV, >4.0-log(10) reduction), and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV, >4.7-log(10) reduction). The respirator integrity (determined on the basis of the particle filtration efficiency and quantitative fit testing) was not compromised after 20 cycles of a 50 min dry heat treatment. On the basis of these results, dry heat decontamination generated by an electric cooker (e.g., rice cookers, instant pots, and ovens) could be an effective and accessible decontamination method for the safe reuse of N95 respirators.

This is not to suggest that there has been no expansion of LSM. This sector has certainly grown and spread across the continent. The decrease in sovereign risk of mining production that accompanied the end of the apartheid era wars and the heightened investment security arrangements in the post Structural Adjustment Programs has resulted in gold production being dispersed to virtually all parts of the continent. The most significant change that has occurred has not been geographic but rather has been the direct result of changes in the nature and technology of gold production. Gold production was once the sole purview of large mining transnationals. This was largely true even outside South Africa. Prior to the 1990s, small scale mining was largely illegal throughout most parts of the continent because governments sought to assure that large scale mines provided the desperately needed taxation revenue for the economic transformation that they all sought. Aside from taxation issues, the issue of industrialisation in Africa is never far from the lips of policymakers. It is an area replete with policy pronouncements about the direction of industrial policy but the reality is that African countries have done almost nothing to make use of the mining activities to diversify their economic base away from mining. Irrespective of what direction Africa takes with regard to gold, whether it is the development of backward or forward linkages, certain developments are necessary. These relate to competitiveness and the creation of economic structures that are robustly governed and of such an order of magnitude as to make Africa a continent which is more than a market and a source of raw materials but a potential location for investment. At present, the political and economic conditions do not yet exist for the transformation of the continent from that of a largely impoverished consumer to that of a competitive producer.","Grynberg, Roman; Singogo, Fwasa K.",African Gold,198,26

Aunque los datos pediátricos muestran de manera consistente un cuadro clínico más leve, se ha identificado que la enfermedad pulmonar crónica es un factor de riesgo para la hospitalización y para desarrollar una enfermedad grave. En África, continente formado predominantemente por países con ingresos bajos o medios (LMIC), la elevada prevalencia de VIH, tuberculosis, desnutrición y hacinamiento aumenta aún más los riesgos a la salud. En este trabajo se revisa la literatura sobre COVID-19 y enfermedad pulmonar crónica en niños, y relata nuestra experiencia en un centro de atención pulmonar pediátrico en Ciudad del Cabo, Sudáfrica. Los datos epidemiológicos en Sudáfrica confirman una baja prevalencia de la enfermedad grave, donde los pacientes < 18 años comprenden 8% de todos los casos diagnosticados de COVID-19 y 3% de todas las admisiones por esa causa.

We aimed to evaluate pre-operative planning and post-operative outcomes in expedited colorectal surgery (ECRS), emergency general surgery (EGS), and emergency orthopaedic surgery (EOS) during the COVID-19 era at our rural hospital. METHOD: This was a prospective observational cohort study. Electronic hospital systems identified adult patients who underwent ECRS, major EGS or EOS at our site, from the start of the UK lockdown. RESULTS: Following exclusion criteria, 98 patients were included in data analysis. Post-operative respiratory complications were seen in 27.8% of ECRS patients, 13.3% of EGS patients and 4% of EOS patients. 2 patients were diagnosed with COVID-19, with 1 COVID-19 associated mortality. Length of hospital stay was reduced for EOS in the COVID-19 setting and this was found to be statistically significant (p value <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: When compared to the literature, COVID-19 related complications in surgical patients were found to be lower at our rural hospital. This could be due to regional variation in the prevalence of COVID-19. If there were to be a second surge, we suggest NHS Trusts should be given the autonomy to make local decisions on modifying their elective caseload, rather than following a national ‘one-size-fits-all’ guideline.","Zahari, F; Shahrokhi, N; Byrne, H C; Gurung, G; Hughes, G; Navaratnam, D M; Rambani, R; Rao, M",Br J Surg,198,1

This paper introduces an efficient and comprehensive utilization process of high-temperature molten steel slag. The waste heat energy in the high-temperature molten steel slag can be fully recovered through the three-stage heat exchange. Through mass balance and energy balance, the theoretical heat recovery rate can reach 81.42 pct when the waste heat stored in steel slag is converted into usable heat energy, and the exergy efficiency of the overall system is 27.93 pct. When the waste heat stored in the steel slag is converted for electric energy, the theoretical heat recovery rate can reach 24.49 pct, and the exergy efficiency of the overall system is 33.83 pct. When the waste heat stored in steel slag is used for cogeneration, the theoretical heat recovery rate can reach 83.98 pct, and the exergy efficiency of the overall system is 38 pct. The normal-temperature solid steel slag produced by the process is easy for iron selection and subsequent high value-added utilization. The solidification of steel slag in this process consumes a large amount of CO(2) so that the free calcium oxide (f-CaO) in the steel slag is fixed, which is more conducive to subsequent utilization, thereby achieving the purpose of energy saving and emission reduction. Compared with the utilization of traditional steel slag, this process can better utilize the energy and resources contained in steel slag and provides a new method for fully utilizing the waste heat energy and resource attributes of high-temperature molten steel slag.

The Occupational Balance Questionnaire (OBQ) is a reliable instrument for measuring OB, although it has not been adapted and validated in Spain so far; therefore, this study had a double aim: (1) to translate and cross-culturally adapt the original OBQ version into Spanish (OBQ-E); (2) to analyze the psychometric properties for its use in the Spanish population. Standard procedures were used for the cross-adaptation process and pilot testing was carried out using three different samples to extend the applicability of the OBQ-E. Validation measures of the final version of the OBQ-E were conducted in a sample of 219 participants. The OBQ-E showed that items and instructions were culturally appropriate and written clearly. Psychometric testing showed excellent internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.87; Guttman split-half coefficient = 0.85), good test–retest reliability (r(s) (Spearman rho) = 0.73), and acceptable convergent validity (overall status, r(s) = 0.37; Related Quality of Life, r(s) = 0.42; Satisfaction with Life Scale, r(s) = 0.54). The findings suggest that the OBQ-E may be a suitable instrument for assessing OB in the Spanish population; hence, it is a promising tool for epidemiological research that will significantly contribute to the understanding of OB as a health-related factor. Nevertheless, further investigation is also warranted to explore the potentiality of this instrument for clinical purposes.","Peral-Gómez, Paula; López-Roig, Sofía; Pastor-Mira, María Ángeles; Abad-Navarro, Ester; Valera-Gran, Desirée; Håkansson, Carita; Wagman, Petra",Int J Environ Res Public Health,198,1

The evolution of equilibrium and dynamic properties with NP loading, total packing fraction, and strength of interfacial attraction is systematically studied based on a minimalist model. Structural predictions of polymer reference interaction site model integral equation theory are employed to establish the rich behavior of the interfacial cohesive force density, surface excess, and a measure of free volume as a function of PNC variables. The glassy dynamic shear modulus is predicted to be softened, reinforced, or hardly changed relative to the pure polymer melt depending on system parameters, as a result of the competing and qualitatively different influences of interfacial cohesion (physical bonding), free volume, and entropic depletion on dynamic localization and shear elasticity. The localization of polymer segments is the dominant factor in determining bulk PNC softening and reinforcement effects for moderate to strong interfacial attractions, respectively. While in the athermal entropy-dominated regime, the primary origin of mechanical reinforcement is the stress stored in the aggregated NP subsystem. The PNC shear modulus is often qualitatively correlated with the segment localization length but with notable exceptions. The present work provides the foundation for developing a theory of segmental relaxation, Tg changes, and collective NP dynamics in PNCs based on a self-consistent treatment of the cooperative activated motions of segments and NPs.","Zhou, Yuxing; Schweizer, Kenneth S",The Journal of chemical physics,198,1

The objectives of this study were to (1) evaluate the liver damage and carcass weight of cattle naturally infected with Fasciola hepatica from the state of Rio Grande do Sul (RS), Brazil, and to (2) determine the distribution of adult flukes in 12,236 cattle liver from RS. The data from these experiments were used to calculate the overall economic loss due to F. hepatica infection. Eighteen adult Polled Hereford cows were divided into a triclabendazole (TbG) and a F. hepatica-positive group (FhG). For Experiment 1, a generalized linear mixed model revealed a statistical difference in carcass weight (49.8 kg) between TbG and FhG. The Monte Carlo analysis also revealed that the animals' weight differences were due to the disease. For Experiment 2, the prevalence of infected livers was above 16% (1904/12,236), mostly (20.1%) from the south-west region of RS. The Susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) epidemic model revealed the evolution of the infection using a high infectivity and low recovery rate. Other distinctive scenarios that occur in RS were also established with different rates of infectivity. The economic assessment showed a potential loss of US$45 million to the beef cattle industry of RS, with an overall State cost of US$90.3 million. These novel findings reveal the importance of fasciolosis infection, which can cause a significant health condition and poor animal welfare.","Molento, M B; Dutra, L H; Pritsch, I C; Garbin, V P; Pereira, A M; Gavião, A; Gabriel, A L; de Sousa, R S; Viana, J G A",Journal of helminthology,198,30

This scoping review provides the first synthesis of research on interpreters working in mental health settings with refugees, one of the most prominent yet understudied strategies to improving language access and the cultural appropriateness of services for this unique population. Comprehensive searches were conducted in PsycINFO, Medline, Web of Science, Social Services Abstracts CAIRN, and Erudit for relevant journal articles and book chapters published up to April 2019. A total of 84 peer-reviewed studies met the inclusion criteria. Publications represented a range of disciplines including social work, linguistics, psychology, anthropology, public health, medicine, psychiatry, and nursing. Six thematic areas were identified: (1) Lack of adequate interpretation as barrier to care; (2) Emotional impact of interpreting on the interpreter; (3) Training and supervision; (4) Impact of the interpreter on the process of psychotherapy/mental health intervention; (5) The impact of the interpreter on the intervention outcome; and (6) The role of the interpreter. The results indicate that despite undeniable challenges, including concerns around confidentiality and bias, when clinicians and refugee clients do not share proficiency in a common language, interpreters have a positive impact on refugee clients' quality of care and clinical outcomes. The implications of these findings for host countries providing mental health services for refugees globally are considered and recommendations offered.

METHODS COVID-19 cases and deaths from 28 February to 21 May 2020 of 37 WHO European countries were aggregated into 12 consecutive weeks. The fuzzy C-means clustering was performed to identify similar countries in COVID-19 incidence and mortality rate. Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient and log-log linear regression analyses were performed to set up relation between COVID-19 mortality rate and age. Mann-Whitney (Wilcoxon) test was used to explore differences between countries possessing higher mortality rate and age. RESULTS Based on the highest value of the coefficient of overall separation five clusters of similar countries were identified for incidence rate, mortality rate and in total. Analysis according to weeks offered trends where progress of COVID-19 incidence and mortality rate was visible. Pearson coefficient (0.69) suggested moderately strong connection between mortality rate and age, Mann-Whitney (Wilcoxon) test proved statistically significant differences between countries experiencing higher mortality rate and age vs. countries having both indicators lower (p < 0.001). Log-log linear regression analysis defined every increase in life expectancy at birth in total by 1% meant growth in mortality rate by 22% (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION Spain, Belgium and Ireland, closely followed by Sweden and Great Britain were identified as the worst countries in terms of incidence and mortality rate in the monitored period. Luxembourg, Belarus and Moldova accompanied the group of the worst countries in terms of incidence rate and Italy, France and the Netherland in terms of mortality rate. Correlation analysis and the Mann-Whitney (Wilcoxon) test proved statistically significant positive relationship between mortality rate and age. Log-log linear regression analysis proved that higher age accelerated the growth of mortality rate.","Zach, Hana; Hanová, Martina; Letkovičová, Mária",Central European journal of public health,198,31

AIM This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of short-wave diathermy (SWD) treatment for moderate COVID-19 patients. DESIGN A prospective, double-blind, randomized controlled clinical study. SETTING Inpatients unit of a COVID-19 specialized hospital. POPULATION Forty-two patients with moderate COVID-19 were randomly allocated at a 2:1 ratio to two groups: the SWD group and the control group. METHODS Participants of the SWD group received SWD treatment, and participants of the control group received placebo SWD treatment for one session per day, 10 minutes per session, for no more than 14 days. Both groups were given standard care treatment. Primary outcome was the rate of clinical improvement according to a sevencategory ordinal scale. Secondary outcomes included the rate of computed tomography (CT) improvement and the rate of potential adverse events. RESULTS Clinical improvement occurred in 92.6% of patients in the SWD group by day 14 compared with 69.2% of patients in the control group (P = 0.001). The Cox model indicated that the SWD group had a higher clinical improvement probability than the control group (Hazard Ratio, 3.045; 95% CI, 1.391-6.666; P = 0.005). Similarly, CT improvement occurred in 85.2 % of patients in the SWD group and 46.2 % of patients in the control group respectively by day 14 (P = 0.001). The Cox model indicated SWD group had a higher CT improvement probability than control group (Hazard Ratio, 3.720; 95% CI, 1.486-9.311; P = 0.005). There was no significant difference in adverse events between the SWD group and the control group (2 of 27 [7.4%] SWD vs. 1 of 13 [7.7%] control, P = 1.000), the most frequent of which were headache (1 of 27 [3.7%] SWD vs. 1 of 13 [7.7%] control patients) and dizziness (1 of 27 [3.7%] SWD vs. 0 of 13 [0%] control patients). CONCLUSIONS SWD is a valid and reliable adjuvant therapy with a favorable safety profile for moderate COVID-19 patients. CLINICAL REHABILITATION IMPACT Clinically relevant information is lacking regarding the efficacy and safety of SWD for patients with COVID-19. This study provides the first evidence that SWD is a promising adjuvant therapy for COVID-19.","Tian, Fei; Wang, Jin; Xi, Xiao; He, Miao; Zhao, Chenguang; Feng, Feng; Wang, Hongbin; Sun, Wei; Mao, Li; Hu, Xu; Sun, Xiaolong; Yuan, Hua",European journal of physical and rehabilitation medicine,198,28

OBJECTIVE To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the PED for treatment of wide necked small and medium intracranial aneurysms. METHODS PREMIER is a prospective, multicenter, single arm trial. Patients were treated with the PED for unruptured wide necked aneurysms, measuring ≤12 mm along the internal carotid artery or vertebral artery, between July 2014 and November 2015. At 1 year post-procedure, the primary effectiveness endpoint was complete occlusion (Raymond grade 1) without major parent vessel stenosis (≤50%) or retreatment, and the primary safety endpoint was major stroke in the territory supplied by the treated artery or neurologic death. RESULTS A total of 141 patients were treated with PEDs (mean age 54.6±11.3 years, 87.9% (124/141) women). Mean aneurysm size was 5.0±1.92 mm, and 84.4% (119/141) measured <7 mm. PED placement was successful in 99.3% (140/141) of patients. Mean number of PEDs implanted per patient was 1.1±0.26; a single PED was used in 92.9% (131/141) of patients. At 1 year, 97.9% (138/141) of patients underwent follow-up angiography with 76.8% (106/138) of patients having met the study's primary effectiveness endpoint. The combined major morbidity and mortality rate was 2.1% (3/140).

The explosion of the Internet of Things (IoT), the enactment of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the growing trend of patients self-managing their diseases, and the eagerness of patients to share their self-collected health data with primary and secondary health organisations further increase the complexity of these challenges. Smart contracts, based on blockchain technology, can be a legitimate approach for addressing these challenges. Smart contracts define rules and penalties in an agreement, enforce those rules, and render them irrevocable.

This right bronchial misplacement may be associated with the tip angle of DLTs. We thus performed a randomized trial to test the hypothesis that the DLT with an acute tip angle enters the right bronchus less frequently than the tube with an obtuse tip angle. METHODS We randomized surgical patients (n = 1427) receiving a polyvinyl chloride left-sided DLT. Before intubation, the curved tip was further bent to an angle of 135° and kept with a stylet inside in the curved-tip group, but not in the control group. After the tip was inserted into the glottis under direct or video laryngoscopy, the stylet was removed and the DLT was advanced into the bronchus with its tip turning to the left. We checked which bronchus was intubated, and the time and number of attempts for intubation. After surgery, we assessed airway injury, sore throat, and hoarseness. The primary outcome was the incidence of right bronchial misplacement of the DLT. RESULTS DLTs were misdirected into the right bronchus more frequently in the control group than in the curved-tip group: 57/715 (8.0%) vs 17/712 (2.4%), risk ratio (95% CI) 3.3 (2.0-5.7), P < 0.001. The difference was significant in the use of 32 (P = 0.003), 35 (P = 0.007), and 37 (P = 0.012) Fr DLTs. Intubation required longer time (P < 0.001) and more attempts (P = 0.002) in the control group. No differences were found in postoperative airway injury, sore throat and hoarseness. CONCLUSIONS Before intubation of left-sided DLTs, augmentation of the curved DLT tip reduced the right bronchial misplacement and facilitated intubation without aggravating airway injury.","Seo, Jeong-Hwa; Yoon, Susie; Min, Se-Hee; Row, Hyung Sang; Bahk, Jae-Hyon",PloS one,198,16

Identifying hospital-level factors that contribute to variations in care can provide opportunities to improve patient outcomes. The purpose of this analysis was to evaluate variation in post-cardiac arrest care within a large EMS system and explore the contribution of hospital-level factors. METHODS This was a retrospective analysis from a regional cardiac system serving over 10 million persons. Patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) with return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) are transported to 36 cardiac arrest centers with 24/7 emergent coronary angiography (CAG) capabilities and targeted temperature management (TTM) policies based on regional guidelines. We included adult patients ≥18 years with non-traumatic OHCA from 2016-2018. Patients with a Do-Not-Resuscitate order and those who died in the emergency department (ED) were excluded. For the TTM analysis, we also excluded patients who were alert in the ED. The primary outcome was receiving CAG or TTM after cardiac arrest. The secondary outcome was neurologic recovery (dichotomized to define a ""good"" outcome as cerebral performance category (CPC) 1 or 2). We used generalized estimating equations including patient-level factors (age, sex, witnessed arrest, initial rhythm) and hospital-level factors (academic status, hospital size based on licensed beds, annual OHCA patient volume) to estimate the odds ratios associated with these variables. RESULTS There were 7831 patients with OHCA during the study period; 4694 were analyzed for CAG and 3903 for TTM. The median and range for treatment with CAG and TTM after OHCA was 23% (12-49%) and 58% (17-92%) respectively. Hospital size was associated with increased likelihood of CAG, adjusted odds ratio 1.71, 95% CI 1.05-2.86, p = 0.03. Academic status approached significance in its association with TTM, adjusted odds ratio 1.69, 95% CI 0.98-2.91, p = 0.06. Overall, 28% of patients survived with good neurologic outcome, ranging from 17 to 43% across hospitals. CONCLUSION Within this regional cardiac system, there was significant variation in use of CAG and TTM after OHCA, which was not fully explained by patient-level factors. Hospital size was associated with increased CAG.","Bosson, Nichole; Tolles, Juliana; Shavelle, David; Niemann, James T; Thomas, Joseph L; French, William J; Gausche-Hill, Marianne",Prehospital emergency care : official journal of the National Association of EMS Physicians and the National Association of State EMS Directors,198,30

Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the echocardiographic features of cardiac injury related to COVID-19 and their prognostic value. METHODS Published studies were identified through searching PubMed, Embase (Elsevier), and Google scholar databases. The search was performed using the different combinations of the keywords ""echocard*,"" ""cardiac ultrasound,"" ""TTE,"" ""TEE,"" ""transtho*,"" or ""transeso*"" with ""COVID-19,"" ""sars-COV-2,"" ""novel corona, or ""2019-nCOV."" Two researchers independently screened the titles and abstracts and full texts of articles to identify studies that evaluated the echocardiographic features of cardiac injury related to COVID-19 and/or their prognostic values. RESULTS Of 783 articles retrieved from the initial search, 11 (8 cohort and 3 cross-sectional studies) met our eligibility criteria. Rates of echocardiographic abnormalities in COVID-19 patients varied across different studies as follow: RV dilatation from 15.0% to 48.9%; RV dysfunction from 3.6% to 40%; and LV dysfunction 5.4% to 40.0%. Overall, the RV abnormalities were more common than LV abnormalities. The majority of the studies showed that there was a significant association between RV abnormalities and the severe forms and death of COVID-19. CONCLUSION The available evidence suggests that RV dilatation and dysfunction may be the most prominent echocardiographic abnormality in symptomatic patients with COVID-19, especially in those with more severe or deteriorating forms of the disease. Also, RV dysfunction should be considered as a poor prognostic factor in COVID-19 patients.","Shafiabadi Hassani, Neda; Shojaee, Abbas; Khodaprast, Zeynab; Sepahvandi, Roya; Shahrestanaki, Ehsan; Rastad, Hadith",Journal of intensive care medicine,198,27

Enteric virus infections are well characterized in poults, but limited studies have been conducted in older birds. The susceptibility of 2-, 7-, 12-, 30-, and 52-wk-old turkeys to turkey coronavirus (TCoV) and turkey astrovirus (TAstV) was evaluated, as well as the effect of combined infection of TAstV and TCoV in 2-wk-old poults and turkey hens. From cloacal swabs and intestines, TCoV was consistently detected by reverse transcriptase-PCR throughout the experimental period (1-21 days postinoculation [DPI]) from all age groups. In contrast, the last detection point of TAstV gradually decreased to 21, 16, and 12 DPI in birds inoculated at 2, 7, and 12 wk of age, respectively, and viral RNA was rarely detected from cloacal swabs or intestinal contents in turkey hens within 3 DPI. Infection with TAstV alone did not affect body weight in poults or egg production in hens. The combined infection of TAstV and TCoV did not induce more severe clinical signs and pathology than the TCoV infection alone. However, a severe prolonged decrease in egg production (about 50%) was observed in turkey hens in the combined infection group compared with a transient egg production drop in the TCoV-infected hens alone. The underlying mechanism regarding the age-related TAstV susceptibility and the pathogenesis of the TAstV and TCoV coinfection in layer hens needs to be further elucidated.","Awe, Olusegun O; Kang, Kyung-il; Ibrahim, Mahmoud; Ali, Ahmed; Elaish, Mohamed; Saif, Yehia M; Lee, Chang-Won",Avian diseases,198,10

An electrode was attached to a double-lumen tube, and placed at vocal cord level to detect the EMG signal evoked by vocal cord movement. Before 4 L lymph node dissection, an automatic periodic stimulation device was applied to the vagus nerve to stimulate vagus nerve continuously. Surgery was suspended if the amplitude decreased lower than the threshold and was resumed when the amplitude recovered. Ten patients (6 male, 4 female) were enrolled. CIONM was successfully performed in all patients without technical failure, and there was no hemodynamic instability. Amplitude decreased below the threshold in four patients. One patient did not recover amplitude and experienced transient vocal cord palsy. In the three other patients, the amplitude recovered above the threshold and no vocal cord palsy occurred. The six patients who did not exhibit amplitude decrease experienced no vocal cord palsy. Our results suggest that CIONM may be applied safely for VATS left lobectomy and may be used to predict postoperative vocal cord function. This approach may be helpful to prevent RLN injury during VATS left lobectomy.","Chai, Young Jun; Lee, Jung-Man; Seong, Yong Won; Moon, Hyeon Jong",Scientific reports,198,1

DNA methylation (DNAm) changes may elucidate adverse health effects of environmental exposures. OBJECTIVES To assess the effects of allergen and diesel exhaust (DE) exposures on global DNAm and its regulation enzymes in human airway epithelium. METHODS 11 participants, including 7 with and 4 without airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), were recruited for a randomized, double-blinded crossover study. Each participant had 3 exposures: filtered air + saline (FA-S), filtered air + allergen (FA-A), and DE + allergen (DE-A). 48 hours post-exposure, endobronchial biopsies and bronchoalveolar lavages (BAL) were collected. Levels of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) and ten-eleven translocation enzymes (TETs), 5-methylcytosine (5mC), and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) were determined by immunohistochemistry. Cytokines and chemokines in BAL were measured by electrochemiluminescence multiplex assays. RESULTS Predominant DNMT (pDNMT, the most abundant among DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B), and predominant TET (pTET, the most abundant among TET1, TET2, and TET3) were participant-dependent. 5mC and its regulation enzymes differed between participants with and without AHR at baseline (FA-S) and in response to allergen challenge (regardless of DE exposure). pDNMT and pTET correlated with lung function. Allergen challenge effect on interleukin-8 in BAL was modified by TET2 baseline levels in the epithelium. CONCLUSIONS Response to allergen challenge is associated with key DNAm regulation enzymes. This relationship is generally unaltered by DE co-exposure but is rather dependent on AHR status.

During the outbreak investigation, we performed molecular genotyping of RSV strains to differentiate between single versus multiple introductions of the virus into the unit. Furthermore, we assessed the time of viral shedding of consecutive samples from the patients in order to better understand the possible impact of prolonged shedding for outbreak control management. We used subtype-specific reverse transcription-PCR on nasopharyngeal and bronchoalveolar specimens for routine diagnostics and for measuring the viral shedding period. Samples of 47 RSV-infected patients involved in the outbreak were genotyped by sequence analysis and compared to samples from RSV-infected hospitalized children representing the timing of the annual RSV epidemic in the community. Molecular investigation of the virus strains from clinical samples revealed a unique cluster with identical nucleotide sequences of RSV type A (RSV A outbreak strain) for 41 patients, while 3 patients were infected with different RSV A (nonoutbreak) strains and three other patients with RSV type B. Outbreak strains were identified in samples from November 2011 until January 2012, while nonoutbreak strains were from samples coinciding with the community epidemic in February and March 2012. Median duration of viral shedding time was 24.5 days (range, 1 to 168 days) with no difference between outbreak and nonoutbreak strains (P = 0.45). Our investigation suggests a single introduction of the RSV A outbreak strain into the unit that spread among the immunocompromised patients. Prolonged viral shedding may have contributed to nosocomial transmission and should be taken into account in the infection control management of RSV outbreaks in settings with heavily immunosuppressed patients.","Geis, Steffen; Prifert, Christiane; Weissbrich, Benedikt; Lehners, Nicola; Egerer, Gerlinde; Eisenbach, Christoph; Buchholz, Udo; Aichinger, Elisabeth; Dreger, Peter; Neben, Kai; Burkhardt, Ulrich; Ho, Anthony D; Kräusslich, Hans-Georg; Heeg, Klaus; Schnitzler, Paul",Journal of clinical microbiology,198,19

Our purpose was to demonstrate which value of packing density is required to produce a durable occlusion. MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively evaluated all patients with unruptured intracranial aneurysms who were treated with stent-assisted coil embolization having late angiographic control between 2004 and 2014, in a single large cerebrovascular referral center. To calculate the packing density, aneurysm volume, and coil volume, we used an on-line system. RESULTS In 49 circumferential unruptured intracranial aneurysms treated with stent-assisted coil embolization, 38.7% (n = 19) had complete occlusion in the immediate control. Of those with incomplete occlusion, 80% (n = 24) progressed to complete occlusion in the late angiographic follow-up. At late angiographic control, 87.7% (n = 43) of aneurysms were completely occluded. All aneurysms with a packing density of ≥19% were completely occluded. Packing density was the only statistically significant predictor of complete occlusion. None of the aneurysms with complete occlusion at immediate control or at late angiographic control had recurrence. CONCLUSIONS In circumferential aneurysms treated with stent-assisted coil embolization, packing density is the main predictor of complete occlusion. In this type of aneurysm, a packing density of ≥19% was enough to reach complete occlusion; knowing this is important to avoid higher packing densities that have more risk.","Tosello, R T; Batista, U C; Pereira, B J A; Piske, R L",AJNR.

In light of recent rekindled interest in humoral immunity, this study aimed at evaluating the impact of baseline characteristics, including IFNL4, on antibody levels to hepatitis C virus (HCV). MATERIALS AND METHODS Pretreatment sera from 279 well-characterized North European Caucasians with chronic HCV genotype 2 or 3 infection having undergone liver biopsy were analyzed regarding IFNL4 (rs12979860) and anti-HCV antibody levels using a commercially available assay. RESULTS Patients producing IFN-λ4 had higher signal to cut-off (S/CO) anti-HCV antibody ratios as compared with those lacking IFN-λ4 (IFNL4rs12979860 CT/TT versus CC, p<.0001, Mann-Whitney U-test). Additionally, in univariate analyses S/CO was significantly higher in men than women (p<.001), as well as in patients with absent/mild interface hepatitis (Ishak grade 0-2 versus 3-4, p = .009), and absent/mild steatosis (grade 0-1 versus 2-3, p = .0005). Also, an inverse correlation with HCV RNA level (rs= -0.14, p = .02) was noted. In multivariate analysis IFN-λ4, gender, steatosis and viral load remained independently associated. CONCLUSIONS To our knowledge, this is the first report that demonstrates that the ability to produce IFN-λ4, in addition to male gender, absent/mild steatosis, and lower viral load, augments antibody levels against HCV. This indicates that IFN-λ4 may be associated with T helper cell 2 (Th2) immune skewing, which might have clinical implications beyond HCV infection.

Chemotherapeutics that target influenza virus are available; however, rapid emergence of drug-resistant strains is common. Therapeutic targeting of host proteins hijacked by influenza virus to facilitate replication is an antiviral strategy to reduce the development of drug resistance. Nuclear export of influenza virus ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) from infected cells has been shown to be mediated by exportin 1 (XPO1) interaction with viral nuclear export protein tethered to vRNP. RNA interference screening has identified XPO1 as a host proinfluenza factor where XPO1 silencing results in reduced influenza virus replication. The Streptomyces metabolite XPO1 inhibitor leptomycin B (LMB) has been shown to limit influenza virus replication in vitro; however, LMB is toxic in vivo, which makes it unsuitable for therapeutic use. In this study, we tested the anti-influenza virus activity of a new class of orally available small-molecule selective inhibitors of nuclear export, specifically, the XPO1 antagonist KPT-335 (verdinexor). Verdinexor was shown to potently and selectively inhibit vRNP export and effectively inhibited the replication of various influenza virus A and B strains in vitro, including pandemic H1N1 virus, highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus, and the recently emerged H7N9 strain. In vivo, prophylactic and therapeutic administration of verdinexor protected mice against disease pathology following a challenge with influenza virus A/California/04/09 or A/Philippines/2/82-X79, as well as reduced lung viral loads and proinflammatory cytokine expression, while having minimal toxicity. These studies show that verdinexor acts as a novel anti-influenza virus therapeutic agent. IMPORTANCE Antiviral drugs represent important means of influenza virus control. However, substantial resistance to currently approved influenza therapeutic drugs has developed. New antiviral approaches are required to address drug resistance and reduce the burden of influenza virus-related disease. This study addressed critical preclinical studies for the development of verdinexor (KPT-335) as a novel antiviral drug. Verdinexor blocks progeny influenza virus genome nuclear export, thus effectively inhibiting virus replication. Verdinexor was found to limit the replication of various strains of influenza A and B viruses, including a pandemic H1N1 influenza virus strain, a highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus strain, and a recently emerging H7N9 influenza virus strain. Importantly, oral verdinexor treatments, given prophylactically or therapeutically, were efficacious in limiting lung virus burdens in influenza virus-infected mice, in addition to limiting lung proinflammatory cytokine expression, pathology, and death. Thus, this study demonstrated that verdinexor is efficacious against influenza virus infection in vitro and in vivo.","Perwitasari, Olivia; Johnson, Scott; Yan, Xiuzhen; Howerth, Elizabeth; Shacham, Sharon; Landesman, Yosef; Baloglu, Erkan; McCauley, Dilara; Tamir, Sharon; Tompkins, S Mark; Tripp, Ralph A",Journal of virology,198,1

Through both direct effects within tumor cells and promotion of tumor-stroma interactions, emmprin induces tumor cell invasiveness and regional angiogenesis. The Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is a common etiology for cancers arising in the setting of immune suppression, including Kaposi's sarcoma and primary effusion lymphoma. However, whether emmprin expression and function are regulated by KSHV or other oncogenic viruses in the tumor microenvironment to promote viral cancer pathogenesis remains unknown. Fibroblasts and endothelial cells support latent KSHV infection and represent cellular components of Kaposi's sarcoma lesions. Therefore, we used primary human fibroblasts and endothelial cells to determine whether KSHV itself regulates emmprin expression, and whether KSHV-emmprin interactions mediate cell invasiveness. We found that KSHV promotes fibroblast and endothelial cell invasiveness following de novo infection through the upregulation of emmprin, and that this effect is mediated by the KSHV-encoded latency-associated nuclear antigen. We also found that emmprin promotes invasiveness, as well as colony formation, by primary effusion lymphoma cells derived from human tumors. Collectively, these data implicate KSHV activation of emmprin as an important mechanism for cancer progression and support the potential utility of targeting emmprin as a novel therapeutic approach for KSHV-associated tumors.","Qin, Zhiqiang; Dai, Lu; Slomiany, Mark G; Toole, Bryan P; Parsons, Chris",Cancer research,198,7

Clinicians need a predictive tool for the onset of neonatal infection to expedite treatment and prevent morbidity. Abnormal thermal gradients, a central-peripheral temperature difference (CPtd) of > 2°C or < 0°C, and elevated heart rate characteristic (HRC) scores are associated with infection. OBJECTIVE This article presents the protocol for the Predictive Analysis using Temperature and Heart Rate (PATH) study. METHODS This observational trial will enroll 440 very preterm infants to measure abdominal temperature (AT) and foot temperature (FT) every minute and HRC scores hourly for 28 days to compare to infection data. Time with abnormal thermal gradients (Model 1) and elevated HRC scores (Model 2) will be compared to the onset of infections. For data analysis, CPtd (AT-FT) will be investigated as two derived variables high CPtd (number/percentage of minutes with CPtd > 2°C) and low CPtd (number/percentage of minutes with CPtd < 0°C). In the infant-level model, the outcome yi will be an indicator of whether the infant was diagnosed with an infection in the first 28 days of life and the high CPtd and low CPtd variables will be the average over the entire observation period; logit(yi) = β0 + xiβ1 + ziγ. For the day-level model, the outcome yit will be an indicator of whether the ith infant was diagnosed with an infection on the tth day from t = 4 through t = 28 or the day that infection is diagnosed (25 possible repeated measures) logit(yit) = β0 + xitβ1 + zitγ. It will be determined whether a model with only high CPtd or only low CPtd is superior in predicting infection. Also, the correlation of abnormal HRC scores with high CPtd and low CPtd values will be assessed. DISCUSSION Study results will inform the design of an interventional study using temperatures and/or heart rate as a predictive tool to alert clinicians of cardiac and autonomic instability present with infection.","Dail, Robin B; Everhart, Kayla C; Hardin, James W; Chang, Weili; Kuehn, Devon; Iskersky, Victor; Fisher, Kimberley; Murphy, Heidi J",Nursing research,198,1

Inadequate anticoagulation increases the risk of thrombosis and jeopardizes both vascular and extracorporeal circuit integrity. The purpose of this study was to evaluate a goal-directed approach for the use of antithrombin in patients who were resistant to heparin. Following institutional review board approval, data were obtained from quality improvement records. A goal-directed protocol for antithrombin was established based upon heparin dosing (400 IU kg-1 body weight) and achieving an activated clotting time of ⩾500 seconds prior to cardiopulmonary bypass. Two groups of patients were identified as those receiving antithrombin and those not receiving antithrombin. Outcome measures included activated clotting time values and transfusion rates. Consecutive patients (n = 140) were included in the study with 10 (7.1%) in the antithrombin group. The average antithrombin dose was 1,029.0 ± 164.5 IU and all patients had restoration to the activated clotting time levels. Patients in the antithrombin group were on preoperative heparin therapy (80.0% vs. 24.6%, p = 0.001). Prior to cardiopulmonary bypass the activated clotting time values were lower in the antithrombin group (417.7 ± 56.1 seconds vs. 581.1 ± 169.8 seconds, p = 0.003). Antithrombin patients had a lower heparin sensitivity index (0.55 ± 0.17 vs. 1.05 ± 0.44 seconds heparin-1 IU kg-1, p = 0.001), received more total heparin (961.3 ± 158.5 IU kg-1 vs. 677.5 ± 199.0 IU kg-1, p = 0.001), more cardiopulmonary bypass heparin (22,500 ± 10,300 IU vs. 12,100 ± 13,200 IU, p = 0.016), and more protamine (5.4 ± 1.2 vs. 4.1 ± 1.1 mg kg-1, p = 0.003).

The objective of this study was to identify patient populations with poor health care access and assess prescribing trends for drugs with published PGx testing guidelines. We used electronic health record data from 67,753 University of Florida Health patients, geographic access scores calculated via the 2-step floating catchment area method, and a composite measure of socioeconomic status. Comparing the poorest (Q4) and greatest (Q1) access score quartiles, poor geographic access was significantly associated with fewer prescriber encounters (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 0.88, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.86-0.91), fewer total unique drugs (IRR 0.92, 95% CI 0.9-0.95), and fewer PGx guideline drugs (IRR 0.94, 95% CI 0.9-0.99). After correcting for number of unique drugs, patients in low-access areas were prescribed a greater proportion of PGx guideline drugs (IRR 1.08, 95% CI 1.04-1.13). We detected significant interactions between Black race and access score. Compared to Q1, Black patients with Q4 access scores were disproportionately affected and had fewer encounters (IRR 0.76, 95% CI 0.7-0.82) and a higher proportion of PGx drugs (IRR 1.26, 95% CI 1.13-1.41), creating further disparity.

Despite the relevance of hMPV as a pathogen, many aspects of the immune response to this virus are still largely unknown. In this report, we focus on the antiviral immune response, which is critical for viral clearance and disease resolution. Using in vitro and in vivo systems, we show that hMPV is able to induce expression of lambda interferon 1 (IFN-λ1), IFN-λ2, IFN-λ3, and IFN-λ4. The induction of IFN-λ expression by hMPV was dependent on interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF-7) expression but not on IRF-3 expression. Treatment of hMPV-infected mice with IFN-λ reduced the disease severity, lung viral titer, and inflammatory response in the lung. Moreover, the IFN-λ response induced by the virus was regulated by the expression of the hMPV G protein. These results show that type III interferons (IFN-λs) play a critical protective role in hMPV infection. IMPORTANCE Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is a pathogen of worldwide importance. Despite the relevance of hMPV as a pathogen, critical aspects of the immune response induced by this virus remain unidentified.

We investigated the effects of isoflurane sedation on cerebral and systemic physiology parameters in neuromonitored ICU stroke patients. METHODS Included in the study were 19 consecutive ventilated patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (12), subarachnoid hemorrhage (4), and ischemic stroke (3) who were switched from intravenous propofol or midazolam to inhalative isoflurane sedation for an average of 3.5 days. During the sedation transition, the following parameters were assessed: mean arterial pressure (MAP), intracranial pressure (ICP), cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), middle cerebral artery mean flow velocity (MFV) and cerebral fractional tissue oxygen extraction (FTOE), as well as systemic cardiopulmonary parameters and administered drugs. RESULTS After the first hour, mean ICP showed an increase of 2.1 mmHg that was not clinically relevant. Likewise, MFV did not change. MAP and CPP, however, decreased by 6.5 and 6.3 mmHg, respectively. FTOE was reduced slightly from 0.24 to 0.21 (p = 0.03). Over an observation period of 12 h, ICP remained stable, while MAP and thus CPP showed distinct decreases (CPP: -10 mmHg at 6 h, p < 0.001; -7.5 mmHg at 12 h, p = 0.005, when compared to preswitch levels) despite a 1.5-fold increase in vasopressor administration. CONCLUSIONS We suggest that that it is possible to reach sufficient sedation levels in cerebrovascular ICU patients by applying volatile isoflurane long-term without a relevant increase in ICP, if baseline ICP values are low or only moderately elevated. However, caution should be exercised in view of isoflurane's decreasing effect on MAP and CPP. Multimodal neuromonitoring is strongly recommended when applying this off-label sedation method.","Bösel, Julian; Purrucker, Jan C; Nowak, Frank; Renzland, Julian; Schiller, Petra; Pérez, Eva Benveniste; Poli, Sven; Brunn, Benjamin; Hacke, Werner; Steiner, Thorsten",Intensive care medicine,198,1

This article aims to explore the discussions and narrative following the inaugural BMUS journal club, highlighting the key discussions and themes from the participants and to provide a narrative for the future of ultrasound continuing professional development. Methods The August 2020 journal club chat was focussed on the article featured in Ultrasound: ""Sonographers' level of autonomy in communication in Australian obstetric settings: Does it affect their professional identity?"" by Thomas et al. Data consisting of Twitter correspondence were extracted and analysed from the advanced search function on Twitter using #BMUS_JC thread. An initial review ensured related content was included. A second review and semantic thematic analysis was then conducted on the 123 tweets. Results In total, seven overall themes were identified between the three sub-threads within the journal club discussions. Those participating in the Twitter discussion recognised the limitations and barriers for communicating results to patients, acknowledging that training, support and regulatory involvement is required for sonographers to change practice locally and internationally. Conclusion The group discussions on Twitter highlight the ongoing issues for sonographers' professional identity worldwide. Furthermore, our analysis echo other contemporary studies which indicate that Twitter journal clubs act as a fruitful and dynamic source of continuing professional development, particularly in an era where social distancing is encouraged. The outcomes of the first BMUS journal club support the wider evidence that online journal clubs can provide a successful platform for professional discussion and debate.","Reeve, Ruth; Moore, Stephen; Kirkpatrick, Catherine",Ultrasound,198,16

In patients with Injury Severity Score ≥16, THC + patients had significantly lower intensive care unit LOS (P = 0.009) and mortality (19.3% versus 25.0% P = 0.038) than drug-negative patients. CONCLUSIONS Although preinjury use of marijuana does not improve survival in trauma patients, it may provide some improvement in outcomes in patients with traumatic brain injury and those that are more severely injured (Injury Severity Score ≥16). The mechanism behind this finding needs further evaluation.","Taghavi, Sharven; Ramirez, Saul; Duchesne, Juan; Tatum, Danielle",The Journal of surgical research,198,13

However, it is important to understand that underlying systems produce those relationships and, ultimately, the occurrence of disease. The risk factors for BRD include a complex set of component causes that include bacterial and viral pathogens, level of host immunity, and environmental conditions that favor pathogen transmission and stress-induced susceptibility. During the post-weaning phase, these factors are superimposed on a system of marketing, transportation, and decisions made to support economic opportunity that further increase the risk for BRD.","Smith, David R",Animal health research reviews,198,1

The scope of this study was to assess the usefulness of combining didactic sessions with a tabletop exercise as educational tools in legal preparedness, to assess the impact of the exercise on the participants' level of confidence about the legal preparedness of a public health system, and to identify legal issue areas in need of further improvement. METHODS The exercise scenario and the pre- and postexercise evaluation were designed to assess knowledge gained and level of confidence in declaration of emergencies, isolation and quarantine, restrictions (including curfew) on the movement of people, closure of public places, and mass prophylaxis, and to identify legal preparedness areas most in need of further improvement at the system level. Fisher exact test and paired t test were performed to compare pre- and postexercise results. RESULTS Our analysis shows that a combination of didactic teaching and experiential learning through a tabletop exercise regarding legal preparedness for infectious disease emergencies can be effective in both imparting perceived knowledge to participants and gathering information about sufficiency of authorities and existence of gaps. CONCLUSIONS The exercise provided a valuable forum to judge the adequacy of legal authorities, policies, and procedures for dealing with pandemic influenza at the state and local levels in Massachusetts. In general, participants were more confident about the availability and sufficiency of legal authorities than they were about policies and procedures for implementing them. Participants were also more likely to report the need for improvement in authorities, policies, and procedures in the private sector and at the local level than at the state level.","Savoia, Elena; Biddinger, Paul D; Fox, Priscilla; Levin, Donna E; Stone, Lisa; Stoto, Michael A",Disaster medicine and public health preparedness,198,1

The aim of this study was to identify potential risk factors for surgical morbidity with a focus on the development of pancreatic fistula. METHODS Clinicopathologic parameters were collected for 283 patients who underwent distal pancreatectomy between January 2000 and May 2010. Logistic regression analyses were performed to identify potential risk factors for surgical morbidity and pancreatic fistula. RESULTS Spleen-preserving pancreatectomy was carried out in 12% of all cases and multivisceral resections were performed in 37.8%. For closure of the pancreatic remnant, three different techniques were used: hand-sewn suture in 44.5%, pancreaticojejunal anastomosis in 24%, and closure by stapler in 31.5%. Overall morbidity and mortality were 53 and 3.5%. Surgical morbidity was observed in 50.2% of all cases and pancreatic fistula in 24%. The stapling group had significantly higher surgical morbidity at 65.2% (p=0.001) and the most pancreatic fistulas, though this did not reach statistical significance (p=0.189). Univariate and multivariate logistic analyses indicated that closure by stapler [odds ratio (OR)=3.61; p<0.001] is a risk factor for surgical morbidity. CONCLUSION Closure of the pancreatic remnant by using a stapling device was associated with an increased risk of surgical morbidity. With an increasing number of laparoscopic distal pancreatectomies being performed, further studies analyzing the use of stapling devices and newer closure techniques are needed.","Reeh, Matthias; Nentwich, Michael F; Bogoevski, Dean; Koenig, Alexandra M; Gebauer, Florian; Tachezy, Michael; Izbicki, Jakob R; Bockhorn, Maximilian",World journal of surgery,198,16

METHODS We did a cross-sectional online survey from March 2 to 2 April 2020 and a total of 19,379 healthcare workers from 25 provinces participated. Depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were assessed by the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) and PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5), respectively. RESULTS The age-standardized prevalence of depression, anxiety and PTSD was 15.5%, 12.7% and 5.2%, respectively. Frontline workers had higher prevalence estimates than non-frontline workers (depression: 18.2% vs. 13.9%; anxiety: 14.7% vs. 11.6%; PTSD: 6.1% vs. 4.6%). Subgroups who were nurses, were married or had dependent children reported higher prevalence of depression, anxiety and PTSD. Despite of the large variations, the prevalence of mental disorders was lowest in East China, followed by Middle China, and highest in West China. CONCLUSION Healthcare workers faced enormous stress not only from the direct risk presented by the COVID-19 outbreak, but also from the profound changes in their professional practice. Prevalence of adverse psychological outcomes has a significant association with geographically distribution of health resources and regional economic level.

The present study characterized and compared the behaviors of B. subtilis subsp. niger spores and S. albus in regard to inactivation by chlorine dioxide (ClO2) gas under different gas concentrations and relative humidity (RH) conditions. The inactivation kinetics under different ClO2 gas concentrations (1 to 5 mg/liter) were determined by first-order and Weibull models. A new model (the Weibull-H model) was established to reveal the inactivation tendency and kinetics for ClO2 gas under different RH conditions (30 to 90%). The results showed that both the gas concentration and RH were significantly (P < 0.05) and positively correlated with the inactivation of the two chosen indicators. There was a rapid improvement in the inactivation efficiency under high RH (>70%). Compared with the first-order model, the Weibull and Weibull-H models demonstrated a better fit for the experimental data, indicating nonlinear inactivation behaviors of the vegetative bacteria and spores following exposure to ClO2 gas. The times to achieve a six-log reduction of B. subtilis subsp. niger spore and S. albus were calculated based on the established models. Clarifying the kinetics of inactivation of B. subtilis subsp. niger spores and S. albus by ClO2 gas will allow the development of ClO2 gas treatments that provide an effective disinfection method. IMPORTANCE Chlorine dioxide (ClO2) gas is a novel and effective fumigation agent with strong oxidization ability and a broad biocidal spectrum. The antimicrobial efficacy of ClO2 gas has been evaluated in many previous studies. However, there are presently no published models that can be used to describe the kinetics of inactivation of airborne pathogens by ClO2 gas under different gas concentrations and RH conditions. The first-order and Weibull (Weibull-H) models established in this study can characterize and compare the behaviors of Bacillus subtilis subsp. niger spores and Staphylococcus albus in regard to inactivation by ClO2 gas, determine the kinetics of inactivation of two chosen strains under different conditions of gas concentration and RH, and provide the calculated time to achieve a six-log reduction. These results will be useful to determine effective conditions for ClO2 gas to inactivate airborne pathogens in contaminated air and other environments and thus prevent outbreaks of airborne illness.","Wang, Tao; Wu, Jinhui; Qi, Jiancheng; Hao, Limei; Yi, Ying; Zhang, Zongxing",Applied and environmental microbiology,198,31

A recent analysis reported that most vaccine pharmacovigilance systems in LMICs consist of spontaneous (passive) adverse event reporting. Thus, LMICs need effective active surveillance approaches, such as pregnancy registries. We intend to identify currently active maternal and neonatal data collection systems in LMICs, with the potential to inform active safety electronic surveillance for novel vaccines using standardized definitions. Methods: A scoping review will be conducted based on established methodology. Multiple databases of indexed and grey literature will be searched with a specific focus on existing electronic and paper-electronic systems in LMICs that collect continuous, prospective, and individual-level data from antenatal care, delivery, neonatal care (up to 28 days), and postpartum (up to 42 days) at the facility and community level, at the national and district level, and at large hospitals. Also, experts will be contacted to identify unpublished information on relevant data collection systems. General and specific descriptions of Health Information Systems (HIS) extracted from the different sources will be combined and duplicated HIS will be removed, producing a list of unique statements. We will present a final list of Maternal, Newborn, and Child Health systems considered flexible enough to be updated with necessary improvements to detect, assess and respond to safety concerns during the introduction of vaccines and other maternal health interventions. Selected experts will participate in an in-person consultation meeting to select up to three systems to be further explored in situ.

Aim of surgery in FAP is to minimize colorectal cancer risk without need for permanent stoma. There are especially two operation options; Total colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis (IRA) and total proctocolectomy with ileo-pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA). We report here a patient with FAP who had resection via rectal eversion just over the dentate line under direct visualization and ileoanal-J pouch anastomosis by double-stapler technique. PRESENTATION OF CASE A 40 yr. old female patient with FAP underwent surgery. Firstly, colon and the rectum mobilized completely, and then from the 10 cm. proximal to the ileo-caecal valve to the recto-sigmoid junction total colectomy was performed. Rectum was everted by a grasping forceps which was introduced through the anus and then resection was performed by a linear stapler just over the dentate line. A stapled J-shaped ileal reservoir construction followed by intraluminal stapler-facilitated ileoanal anastomosis. Follow up at six months anal sphincter function was found normal. DISCUSSION There is only surgical management option for FAP patients up to now. Total colectomy with IRA and restorative proctocolectomy with IPAA is surgical options for FAP patients that avoid the need for a permanent stoma. Anorectal eversion may be used in the surgical treatment of FAP, chronic ulcerative colitis and early stage distal rectal cancer patients.

Previous studies have suggested an association between influenza and acute myocardial infarction, but those studies used nonspecific measures of influenza infection or study designs that were susceptible to bias. We evaluated the association between laboratory-confirmed influenza infection and acute myocardial infarction. METHODS We used the self-controlled case-series design to evaluate the association between laboratory-confirmed influenza infection and hospitalization for acute myocardial infarction. We used various high-specificity laboratory methods to confirm influenza infection in respiratory specimens, and we ascertained hospitalization for acute myocardial infarction from administrative data. We defined the ""risk interval"" as the first 7 days after respiratory specimen collection and the ""control interval"" as 1 year before and 1 year after the risk interval. RESULTS We identified 364 hospitalizations for acute myocardial infarction that occurred within 1 year before and 1 year after a positive test result for influenza. Of these, 20 (20.0 admissions per week) occurred during the risk interval and 344 (3.3 admissions per week) occurred during the control interval. The incidence ratio of an admission for acute myocardial infarction during the risk interval as compared with the control interval was 6.05 (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.86 to 9.50). No increased incidence was observed after day 7. Incidence ratios for acute myocardial infarction within 7 days after detection of influenza B, influenza A, respiratory syncytial virus, and other viruses were 10.11 (95% CI, 4.37 to 23.38), 5.17 (95% CI, 3.02 to 8.84), 3.51 (95% CI, 1.11 to 11.12), and 2.77 (95% CI, 1.23 to 6.24), respectively.

The importance of tetrastarch dose, however, is unknown. METHODS A retrospective observational study was performed in two trauma centres using data on type and amount of fluids (balanced crystalloids or tetrastarch) used for pre- and acute in-hospital shock management. We evaluate independent associations between the relative and absolute volumes of tetrastarch and 90-day survival time or the frequency of severe acute kidney failure (AKF). RESULTS We studied 271 patients who had sustained a severe blunt trauma injury (average predicted mortality according to the Revised Injury Severity Classification Score (RISC) 15.1 ± 1.4% [mean, standard deviation]), and who had required more than 2 days of intensive care therapy. In all, 75.3% of patients had received tetrastarch with a crystalloid/colloid ratio of 2.93 ± 2.60. The 90-day mortality was 11.1%, and 7.8% of the patients developed severe AKF. After adjusting for confounders, we found a U-shaped, nonlinear association between absolute or relative volumes of tetrastarch and survival time (p = 0.003 and 0.025, respectively). Optimal relative volumes of tetrastarch approximately ranged from 20 to 30% of total fluids. Giving less than about 1000 ml, or more than about 2000 ml tetrastarch was significantly associated with an increased risk of developing severe AKF (p = 0.023). CONCLUSIONS There was a complex U‑shaped association between the tetrastarch dose and morbidity/mortality of patients after a severe trauma injury. The optimal crystalloid/tetrastarch ratio for acute shock management appears to range from about 2.5 to 4.0.","Fleischhacker, E; Trentzsch, H; Kuppinger, D; Piltz, S; Beyer, F; Meigel, F; Kammerer, T; Rehm, M; Hartl, W H","Medizinische Klinik, Intensivmedizin und Notfallmedizin",198,1

We report on the average narcotic usage in a group of patients treated with an identical multimodal pain protocol following TKA. MATERIALS AND METHODS 49 patients undergoing TKA participated in the survey. Patients with pre-op narcotic use, recent prior total joint arthroplasty or study refusal were excluded. All patients received a spinal anesthetic. No pre-surgery narcotics were given. All received an identical local infiltrative anesthetic combination along with a multimodal pain protocol. Patients were placed into an identical rapid rehab program. Narcotic usage during hospitalization was recorded in morphine equivalent doses (MED). Patients were given a journal to record their daily narcotic utilization. RESULTS Pre-operative pain scores of the excluded groups had slightly higher but clinically insignificant differences compared to the study group. In the hospital, POD1 study group daily MED averaged 28 (range 0-110). POD2 had an average of 33.6 and POD 3 daily usages averaged 28.6 (range 0-100). By the end of week two, the average daily use was 19.2 and 24% patients were off all narcotics. By the end of week four, the average daily usage was 7.5 and 63% of patients were off all narcotics. By 8 weeks, there were no patients still taking narcotics. KSS averaged 76.9 (range 51-97) at the 6 week visit, and 94.2 at the 3-month visit (range 72-100).

Therefore, their prompt detection is mandatory for successful patient treatment. Solid phase red cell adherence (SPRCA) assay allows for platelet antibody detection widely. However, preparation of fresh platelets with HLA-I and human platelet antigens (HPA)1-5,15 genotyped as target cells is inconvenient and fresh platelets have a short shelf life. In this study, the lyophilised human platelets for antibody detection in SPRCA were prepared. Firstly, platelets were resuspended in lyophilisation buffer and freeze-dried. Then the characteristics of lyophilised platelet were analysed. Rehydrated platelets were recovered with a mean rate of 80.91% ± 2.87%, and still retained spherical morphology. Indirect flow cytometry showed that glycoproteins IIb/IIIa, Ia/IIa, Ib/IX, IV, CD109, and HLA class I were present on the surface of the lyophilised platelets at a comparable level to that of fresh platelets. The consistent results obtained with WHO reference reagents containing anti-HPA-1a, anti-HPA-3a, and anti-HPA-5b, as well as clinical samples from the same donors containing anti-HLA antibodies when reacting with lyophilised versus fresh platelets confirmed good antigenicity preservation of platelets after freeze-drying. Further investigation showed that the lyophilised platelets could be stored at 2-8 °C for up to 14 months and the reconstituted suspension was stable for 48 h. Therefore, lyophilised platelets can be a convenient alternative to fresh platelets to use for anti-platelet antibody detection in SPRCA tests.","Duan, Shengbao; Wang, Mingyuan; Ding, Shaohua; Chen, Yezhou; Wei, Shuangshi; Chen, Wei; Zhang, Chun; Li, Yong; Wang, Hongmei",Journal of immunological methods,198,1

Despite important advances in methods that genuinely embody participatory research practices, attention to collaborative data collection, analysis, and dissemination are limited. Our aim is to describe the development and implementation of research practices to address these gaps through an emphasis on and understanding of the centrality of language in collaborative research processes. METHOD Guided from the outset by community-based participatory research principles, our community-academic research partnership recognized the importance of developing and intentionally studying our collaborative processes. As part of an ethnographic interview study with 24 Latinx/@ immigrants, a community-university research team developed innovative methods, including practices related to research team meetings, data collection, analysis, and dissemination, which we documented through ongoing discussion and reflection. RESULTS The resulting participatory research processes were grounded in a theoretical framework of praxis and language and included six innovative and iterative stages: (a) Establishing the research team, (b) planning the interview process/data collection, (c) developing the data analysis methodology, (d) interpreting findings to adapt the intervention, (e) integrating results of the participatory process into the analysis, and (f) data analysis for dissemination. CONCLUSIONS A focus on praxis and language revealed how the language of research structures' power, meaning, feeling, collaboration, analysis, and transformation. We also found that bilingual participatory analytic processes have important implications with respect to achieving genuine inclusion in rigorous research that moves toward equity for Latinx/@ immigrants and other populations.

Two mRNA cap methyltransferase (MTase) activities involved in the formation of the cap, the (guanine-N7)- and the (nucleoside-2'O)-MTases (2'O-MTase), reside in a single domain of non-structural protein NS5 (NS5MTase). This study reports on the biochemical characterization of the 2'O-MTase activity of NS5MTase of dengue virus (NS5MTase(DV)) using purified, short, capped RNA substrates ((7Me)GpppAC(n) or GpppAC(n)). NS5MTase(DV) methylated both types of substrate exclusively at the 2'O position. The efficiency of 2'O-methylation did not depend on the methylation of the N7 position. Using (7Me)GpppAC(n) and GpppAC(n) substrates of increasing chain lengths, it was found that both NS5MTase(DV) 2'O activity and substrate binding increased before reaching a plateau at n=5. Thus, the cap and 6 nt might define the interface providing efficient binding of enzyme and substrate. K(m) values for (7Me)GpppAC(5) and the co-substrate S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet) were determined (0.39 and 3.26 microM, respectively). As reported for other AdoMet-dependent RNA and DNA MTases, the 2'O-MTase activity of NS5MTase(DV) showed a low turnover of 3.25x10(-4) s(-1). Finally, an inhibition assay was set up and tested on GTP and AdoMet analogues as putative inhibitors of NS5MTase(DV), which confirmed efficient inhibition by the reaction product S-adenosyl-homocysteine (IC(50) 0.34 microM) and sinefungin (IC(50) 0.63 microM), demonstrating that the assay is sufficiently sensitive to conduct inhibitor screening and characterization assays.","Selisko, Barbara; Peyrane, Frédéric F; Canard, Bruno; Alvarez, Karine; Decroly, Etienne",The Journal of general virology,198,31

The observation was made on the basis of results from studies where patients underwent different type of surgery, but laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) was not among them. It is necessary to reevaluate the association of age with adverse events in the group of patients after LSG. Aim To investigate the association of age with surgery-related adverse events in patients after LSG. Material and methods Retrospective analysis of medical data was performed. The study involved 345 patients who underwent LSG in our institution between January 2013 and December 2014. The patients were subdivided by age into four groups according to quartiles. In 30-day follow-up adverse events were evaluated. We considered the presence of the following events as the endpoint of our study: death, medical events and surgical events. Results In general, we observed adverse events in 36 (10.4%) patients. The mortality rate in our study was 0.59%. Nineteen events were surgical and 18 medical. In 1 patient a surgical event was associated with a medical event. Bleeding was the most common surgical event and was observed in 17 (4.9%) cases.

STUDY DESIGN Case series. ANIMALS Stallions (n = 30) aged 3-15 that had previous acquired SIH. METHODS Bilateral standing laparoscopic PFH was performed on 30 stallions that had previous acquired SIH treated without castration. The vaginal rings were approached from 3 portals, 2 in the paralumbar fossa and a 3rd between the 17th and 18th ribs on the ipsilateral side. A large inverted U-shaped peritoneal flap was dissected from the abdominal wall proximal and cranial to the vaginal ring, reflected caudally over the vaginal ring, and secured to the abdominal wall with laparoscopic staples. In the first 11 stallions, only the cranial and mid third of the vaginal ring was covered. For the next 19 stallions, complete closure of the vaginal ring including the entire caudal aspect of the vaginal ring was achieved. RESULTS SIH recurrence occurred in 4 of 11 stallions with incomplete ring closure whereas no SIH recurrence occurred when the entire vaginal ring was closed. No major complications occurred and cosmetic outcome was excellent. All breeding stallions were successfully used for breeding. CONCLUSION Standing laparoscopic closure of the vaginal ring using a PFH is an effective way to prevent recurrence of SIH provided the entire vaginal ring, including the caudal aspect is covered by the flap.

CASE PRESENTATION Treatments used in our patient began with a complete cytoreductive surgery. This required visceral resections, parietal peritonectomy, peritonectomy of the small bowel and its mesentery, and a peritoneal resection of the colonic mesentery with sparing of the major vasculature of the large bowel. CLINICAL DISCUSSION Peritoneal resection of the colonic mesentery and other treatments were performed in the absence of major complications. A 20-day hospitalization was required. The patient shows no internal hernias and no evidence of disease by CT follow-up at 4 years postoperatively. Her quality of life is excellent.

The treatment, however, remains controversial but depends on institutional expertise. This case series reports the first experience with single-incision laparoscopic totally extraperitoneal (SILTEP) repair of Spigelian hernias with telescopic extraperitoneal dissection in combination with inguinal hernia repair. METHODS From February 2013 to April 2014, all patients referred with inguinal or Spigelian hernias, without histories of extraperitoneal intervention, underwent SILTEP repair with telescopic extraperitoneal dissection. A single-port device, 5.5 mm/52 cm/30° angled laparoscope, and conventional straight dissecting instruments were used for all cases. Extraperitoneal dissection was performed under direct vision with preservation of preperitoneal fascia overlying retroperitoneal nerves. Inguinal herniorrhaphy was performed with lightweight mesh that covered low-lying Spigelian defects. High-lying Spigelian defects were repaired with additional mesh. RESULTS There were 131 patients with 186 (92 direct) inguinal hernias and 7 patients with 8 Spigelian hernias (6 incidental, including 1 bilateral and 2 preoperatively diagnosed), with a mean age of 51.3 years and a mean body mass index of 25.1 kg/m(2). An additional piece of mesh was used for 3 hernias. All Spigelian hernias were associated with direct inguinal hernias, and 8 combined inguinal and Spigelian hernias were successfully repaired with SILTEP repair with telescopic extraperitoneal dissection as day cases. There were no clinical recurrences during a mean follow-up period of 6 months (range, 1-15 months). CONCLUSIONS Combined Spigelian and inguinal hernias can be successfully treated with SILTEP herniorrhaphy with telescopic extraperitoneal dissection. The high incidence of Spigelian hernias associated with direct inguinal hernias suggests a high index of suspicion for Spigelian hernias during laparoscopic inguinal herniorrhaphy.","Tran, Hanh; Tran, Kim; Zajkowska, Marta; Lam, Vincent; Hawthorne, Wayne J",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,198,6

However, the cause for this enhanced susceptibility remains unclear, and the effects of HIV on pulmonary perfusion and ventilation are unknown. METHODS: We used PET-CT in 46 smokers and non-smokers, 23 of whom had documented HIV infection. Emphysema was assessed by CT and perfusion by nitrogen-13 (13NN) PET scans. After removal of image noise, vertical and axial gradients in perfusion were calculated. We tested for differences in the total spatial heterogeneity of perfusion (CV2Qtotal) and its components (CV2Qtotal = CV2Qvgrad (vertical gradient) + CV2Qzgrad (axial gradient) + CV2Qr (residual heterogeneity)) among groups. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in demographic parameters among groups, and all subjects had minimal radiographic evidence of emphysema. Compared to controls, non-smokers living with HIV had a significantly greater CV2 Qr/ CV2Qtotal (0.48 vs 0.36, P = 0.05) and reduced CV2Qvgrad/ CV2Qtotal (0.46 vs 0.65, P = 0.038). Smokers also had a reduced CV2Qvgrad/ CV2Qtotal, however, there was no significant difference in CV2Qvgrad/ CV2Qtotal between smokers living with and without HIV (0.39 vs 0.34, P = 0.58), despite a decreased vertical perfusion gradient (Qvgrad) in smokers living with HIV. CONCLUSION: In non-smokers living with well-controlled HIV and minimal radiographic emphysema, HIV infection contributes to pulmonary perfusion abnormalities similar to smokers. These data indicate the onset of subclinical pulmonary perfusion abnormalities that could herald the development of significant lung disease in these susceptible individuals.","Kohli, Puja; Kelly, Vanessa Jane; Hibbert, Kathryn; Corleis, Bjorn; Kone, Mamary; Cho, Josalyn; Defaria-Yeh, Doreen; Kwon, Douglas; Medoff, Benjamin; Harris, Robert Scott; Winkler, Tilo","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",198,33

METHODS In December 2020, we searched for published data in PubMed, LILACS, EMBASE, and other sources, including the grey literature. Studies were eligible if they were conducted in LAC and reported the direct medical costs, productivity loss costs, out-of-pocket expenditure, and other costs to patients with BC and their relatives. No restrictions were imposed on the type of BC population (metastatic BC or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive/negative BC, among others). We summarised the characteristics and methodological approach of each study and the healthcare costs by cancer stage. We also developed and applied an original ad hoc instrument to assess the quality of the cost estimation studies. RESULTS We identified 2725 references and 63 included studies. In total, 79.3% of the studies solely reported direct medical costs and five solely reported costs to patients and their relatives. Only 14.3% of the studies were classified as of high quality. The pooled weighted average direct medical cost per patient-year (year 2020 international dollars [I$]) by BC stage was I$13,179 for stage I, I$15,556 for stage II, I$23,444 for stage III, and I$28,910 for stage IV. CONCLUSION This review provides the first synthesis of BC costs in LAC. Our findings show few high-quality costing studies in BC and a gap in the literature measuring costs to patients and their relatives. The high costs associated with the advanced stages of BC call into question the affordability of treatments and their accessibility for patients.

The primary aim of the study was to review the existing literature about patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) in colorectal cancer and IBD. The secondary aim was to present a road map to develop a core outcome set via opinion gathering using social media. Method. This study is the first step of a three-step project aimed at constructing simple, applicable PROMs in colorectal surgery. This article was written in a collaborative manner with authors invited both through Twitter via the #OpenSourceResearch hashtag. The 5 most used PROMs were presented and discussed as slides/images on Twitter. Inputs from a wide spectrum of participants including researchers, surgeons, physicians, nurses, patients, and patients' organizations were collected and analyzed. The final draft was emailed to all contributors and 6 patients' representatives for proofreading and approval. Results. Five PROM sets were identified and discussed: EORTC QLQ-CR29, IBDQ short health questionnaire, EORTC QLQ-C30, ED-Q5-5L, and Short Form-36. There were 315 tweets posted by 50 tweeters with 1458 retweets. Awareness about PROMs was generally limited. The general psycho-physical well-being score (GPP) was suggested and discussed, and then a survey was conducted in which more than 2/3 of voters agreed that GPP covers the most important aspects in PROMs. Conclusion. Despite the limitations of this exploratory study, it offered a new method to conduct clinical research with opportunity to engage patients. The general psycho-physical well-being score suggested as simple, applicable PROMs to be eventually combined procedure-specific, disease-specific, or symptom-specific PROMs if needed.","El-Hussuna, Alaa; Rubio-Perez, Ines; Millan, Monica; Pellino, Gianluca; Negoi, Ionut; Gallo, Gaetano; Shalaby, Mostafa; Celentano, Valerio; Green, Ryan; Minaya-Bravo, Ana; Emile, Sameh; Smart, Neil J; Maeda, Yasuko; Ivatury, Srinivas J; Mackenzie, Graham; Yalçınkaya, Ali; Mellenthin, Claudia; N Dudi-Venkata, Nagendra; Davies, Justin; McNair, Angus; Pata, Francesco; Gymoese Berthelsen, Kasper; Rivadeneira, David; Spinelli, Antonino; Myrelid, Pår; Mayol, Julio; Wexner, Steven",Surgical innovation,198,1

Smaller hospitals may have limited supply of blood, and air medical systems may not carry blood. The primary outcome is to quantify the number of patients meeting established physiologic criteria for blood product administration and to identify which patients receive and which ones do not receive it due to lack of availability locally. METHODS Electronic patient care records were used to identify a retrospective cohort of patients undergoing emergent air medical transport in Ontario, Canada, who are likely to require blood. Presenting problems for blood product administration were identified. Physiologic data were extracted with criteria for transfusion used to identify patients where blood product administration is indicated. RESULTS There were 11,520 emergent patient transports during the study period, with 842 (7.3%) where blood product administration was considered. Of these, 290 met established physiologic criteria for blood products, with 167 receiving blood, of which 57 received it at a hospital with a limited supply. The mean number of units administered per patient was 3.5. The remaining 123 patients meeting criteria did not receive product because none was unavailable. CONCLUSION Indications for blood product administration are present in 2.5% of patients undergoing time-sensitive air medical transport. Air medical services can enhance access to potentially lifesaving therapy in patients with hemorrhagic shock by carrying blood products, as blood may be unavailable or in limited supply locally in the majority of patients where it is indicated.","MacDonald, Russell D; Ramjaun, Aliya",CJEM,198,1

In this study, the potential of in silico molecular docking-based drug repositioning approach was exploited for identifying the inhibitors of Mpro and SP of SARS-CoV-2. METHODS A total of 196 compounds including various US-FDA-approved drugs, vitamins and their analogs were docked with Mpro (PDB IDs: 6YB7 and 6Y84), and the top six ligands were further tested for ADME properties followed by docking with SP (PDB IDs: 6LXT and 6W41). RESULTS Out of 196 compounds, binding energy (DE) of Silybin B (6YB7: DE: -11.20 kcal/mol; 6Y84: DE: -10.18 kcal/mol; 6LXT:DE: -10.47 kcal/mol; 6W41:DE: -10.96 kcal/mol) and Cianidanol (6YB7:DE: -8.85 kcal/mol; 6Y84:DE:-10.02 kcal/mol; 6LXT:DE:-9.36 kcal/mol; 6W41:DE: -9.52 kcal/mol) demonstrated better binding and ADME properties compared with the currently endeavored drugs like Hydroxychloroquine and Lopinavir. Additionally, Elliptinone, Diospyirin, SCHEMBL94263 and Fiboflavin have shown encouraging results. Fiboflavin, an immunity booster, was found to inhibit both the Mpro and spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. It was observed that amino acid residues MET6, ALA7, PHE8, PRO9, ASP295, GLY302, VAL303 and THR304 play significant roles in protein-ligand interactions through hydrogen bonds and Vander Waals forces. CONCLUSION Silybin B and Cianidanol showed excellent binding and ADME properties compared with the currently endeavored drugs and can be exploited as therapeutic options against SARS-CoV-2 infection after experimental validation and clinical trials.","Srivastava, Rashi; Tripathi, Shubham; Unni, Sreepoorna; Hussain, Arif; Haque, Shafiul; Dasgupta, Nandita; Singh, Vineeta; Mishra, Bhartendu Nath",Current pharmaceutical design,198,1

However, a significant concern is the short- and long-term durability of the stent graft fabric during and after fenestration. METHODS This study utilizes the textiles analysis techniques of macro- and microscopic imaging, tear strength testing, burst strength testing, and accelerated cyclic fatigue testing on the fabrics of the Cook Zenith, Medtronic Talent, and Medtronic Endurant stent grafts (three polyester grafts), as well as two different expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) membranes. Specimens were punctured using radiofrequency, and serially dilated with angioplasty balloons (3, 5, and 7 mm). For each type of fabric, three groups were analyzed: control, radiofrequency (RF) puncture only, and balloon dilated. RESULTS A total of 110 specimens were analyzed, with 80 of them having been fenestrated. The Zenith fabric had the greatest strength after fenestration, but was limited by the inability to fully dilate the fenestration with the conventional balloons, which only achieved 26-29% of their nominal balloon diameter. While the Talent and Endurant grafts could be dilated with balloons, the orifices were markedly elliptical not circular. After accelerated fatigue testing, there was an increase in the size of fenestrations of the Talent fabric. There was no increase in fenestration size for the Endurant fabric, Zenith fabric, or the ePTFE fabrics, after fatigue testing. CONCLUSIONS While the Zenith fabric was the strongest both before and after fenestration, it requires further study with cutting balloons to achieve full-sized fenestrations. All fenestrations remained stable during fatigue testing except for the Talent fabric. This study serves as the baseline for future studies that will include stent grafts, branch stents, and cutting balloons.","Eadie, L A; Soulez, G; King, M W; Tse, L W",European journal of vascular and endovascular surgery : the official journal of the European Society for Vascular Surgery,198,17

METHODS The Westlaw legal database was queried for all iatrogenic ureteral injury cases. Variables extracted included available clinical factors, method of settlement, and litigation outcomes. Linear regression analysis was conducted to examine factors associated with award amount. RESULTS A total of 522 cases from 1961-2019 were included in the study. The most common specialty named was gynecology (353/512, 68.9%), followed by urology (89/512, 17.4%). The most common claim was intraoperative negligence (474/522 cases, 90.8%). Fifty two cases were settled or arbitrated and 470 went to trial. Settlement or arbitration was more likely in cases involving institution-only defendant (15.4% vs 7.3%, p<0.01), academic institution (19.7% vs 7.1%, p<0.01) and patient death (42.9% vs 10.7%; p<0.001). Of cases that went to trial, the verdict favored the defendant in 339/470 cases (72.1%). The median award was $552,822.96 (IQR 187,007-1,063,603). Duration of temporary drainage ($5050/day, p = 0.02), delayed repair (p=0.03), claim of inadequate workup (p=0.03), and claim of failure to supervise trainee (p<0.001) were significantly associated with increasing award amount. CONCLUSION The majority of ureteral injury litigation ruled in favor of the defendant. However, when awarded, the amount was substantial and correlated with drainage duration, delayed repair, claim of inadequate workup, and failure to supervise trainee. These findings highlight factors perceived to be associated with significant distress and reflect trends in medicolegal decision-making.","Bole, Raevti; Linder, Brian J; Gopalakrishna, Ajay; Kuang, Ruby; Boon, Ashton L; Habermann, Elizabeth B; Ziegelmann, Matthew J; Gettman, Matthew T; Husmann, Douglas A; Viers, Boyd R",Urology,198,1

BACKGROUND Surgical coaching is a developing strategy for improving surgeons' intraoperative performance. How to cultivate effective coaching skills among practicing surgeons is uncertain. METHODS Through the Surgical Coaching for Operative Performance Enhancement (SCOPE) program, 46 surgeons within 4 US academic medical centers were assigned 1:1 into coach/coachee pairs. All attended a 3-hour Surgical Coaching Workshop-developed using evidence from the fields of surgery and education-then received weekly reminders. We analyzed workshop evaluations and audio transcripts of postoperative debriefs between coach/coachee pairs, co-coding themes based on established principles of effective coaching: (i) self-identified goals, (ii) collaborative analysis, (iii) constructive feedback, and (iv) action planning. Coaching principles were cross-referenced with intraoperative performance topics: technical, nontechnical, and teaching skills. RESULTS For the 8 postoperative debriefs analyzed, mean duration was 24.4 min (range 7-47 minutes). Overall, 326 coaching examples were identified, demonstrating application of all 4 core principles of coaching. Constructive feedback (17.6 examples per debrief) and collaborative analysis (16.3) were utilized more frequently than goal-setting (3.9) and action planning (3.0).

For the 3-month period from January 1 to March 30, 2020, the number of calls about exposure to cleaners and disinfectants made to US poison centers in all states increased 20.4%, and the number of calls about exposure to disinfectants increased 16.4%. We examined calls about cleaners and disinfectants to the Michigan Poison Center (MiPC) since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. We compared all calls related to exposure to cleaners or disinfectants, calls with symptoms, and calls in which a health care provider was seen during the first quarters of 2019 and 2020 and in relationship to key COVID-19 dates. From 2019 to 2020, the number of all disinfectant calls increased by 42.8%, the number of calls with symptoms increased by 57.3%, the average number of calls per day doubled after the first Michigan COVID-19 case, from 4.8 to 9.0, and the proportion of calls about disinfectants among all exposure calls to the MiPC increased from 3.5% to 5.0% (P < .001). Calls for exposure to cleaners did not increase significantly. Exposure occurred at home for 94.8%97.1% of calls, and ingestion was the exposure route for 59.7% of calls.

AI is increasingly being deployed across multiple domains. In response, a plethora of ethical guidelines and principles for general AI use have been published, with some convergence about which ethical concepts are relevant to this new technology. However, few of these frameworks are healthcare-specific, and there has been limited examination of actual AI applications in healthcare. Our ethical evaluation identifies context- and case-specific healthcare ethical issues for two applications, and investigates the extent to which the general ethical principles for AI-assisted healthcare expressed in existing frameworks capture what is most ethically relevant from the perspective of healthcare ethics. We provide a detailed description and analysis of two AI-based systems for clinical decision support (Painchek® and IDx-DR). Our results identify ethical challenges associated with potentially deceptive promissory claims, lack of patient and public involvement in healthcare AI development and deployment, and lack of attention to the impact of AIs on healthcare relationships. Our analysis also highlights the close connection between evaluation and technical development and reporting. Critical appraisal frameworks for healthcare AIs should include explicit ethical evaluation with benchmarks. However, each application will require scrutiny across the AI life-cycle to identify ethical issues specific to healthcare. This level of analysis requires more attention to detail than is suggested by current ethical guidance or frameworks.","Rogers, Wendy A; Draper, Heather; Carter, Stacy M",Bioethics,198,31

The diagnosis of POEMS syndrome is 2 of the mandatory major criteria (polyneuropathy and monoclonal plasma cell disorder), 1 of the other major criteria (Castleman's disease, sclerotic bone lesions, or vascular endothelial growth factor elevation), and at least 1 of the minor criteria (organomegaly, extravascular volume overload, endocrinopathy, skin changes, papilledema, thrombocytosis, or polycythemia). However, some cases do not fully meet the diagnostic criteria, such cases are referred to as incomplete or atypical POEMS syndrome. PATIENT CONCERNS A 58-year-old Chinese female was admitted to our department of neurology with weakness of both arms and legs. In addition,it's found that she had skin manifestations, lymphadenopathies, pedal edema, immunoglobin - A-λ restricted paraproteinemia, and elevated vascular endothelial growth factor and other features, but without polyneuropathy. DIAGNOSES:: we made a diagnosis of atypical POEMS syndrome without polyneuropathy. INTERVENTIONS Two drug regimens were recommended: VAD (Vincristine, Adriamycin, Dexamethasone) and bortezomib. Finally, the VAD strategy was performed. OUTCOMES The patient's limb strength and pain improved and enzyme parameters decreased gradually after 4 weeks. However, the treatment was still not perfect. CONCLUSION We reported a rare case of POEMS syndrome without polyneuropathy. We hope similar cases will be reported in the future.","Li, Qiang; Xu, Fang; Duan, Jing-Feng; Tang, Yu-Feng",Medicine,198,1

The speed at which adults walk may be a proxy for intensity. Traditional estimates of indoor walking speed are unlikely to reflect self-selected usual or other instructed paces of outdoor walking speed. OBJECTIVE To inform estimates of pace-based walking speed of apparently healthy adults in outdoor settings. METHODS We searched four electronic databases for articles published in English between January 1970 and March 2019. Studies that reported walking speed (m/s), cadence (steps/min), or intensity (mL/kg/min) of ambulatory, apparently healthy, and community-dwelling adults (> 18 years) were included. Walking speed categories were defined according to the description provided in each study. Meta-analysis was used to synthesise speed, cadence, and intensity data by slow, usual, medium, fast, and maximal pace (where reported). RESULTS Thirty-five studies, representing 14,015 participants (6808 women, 5135 men, and 2072 sex not specified), were identified. The mean (95% CI) walking speed for slow, usual, medium, fast, and maximal pace was 0.82 (0.77-0.86), 1.31 (1.27-1.35), 1.47 (1.44-1.49), 1.72 (1.64-1.81), and 1.62 (1.45-1.79) m/s, respectively. Mean cadence (95% CI) for usual and fast paces were 116.65 (114.95-118.35) and 126.75 (121.87-131.63) steps/min, respectively. The mean oxygen consumption (95% CI) for the usual and medium paces was 11.97 (11.69-12.25) and 13.34 (12.94-13.73) mL/kg/min, respectively. CONCLUSION These findings provide greater clarity with regard to how various indicators of enacted walking pace, speed, and intensity overlap and how each can be best communicated in the real-world setting to optimise health-related outcomes. Pace-based instructions can be used to support walking in outdoor settings within public health guidelines.","Murtagh, Elaine M; Mair, Jacqueline L; Aguiar, Elroy; Tudor-Locke, Catrine; Murphy, Marie H",Sports medicine,198,12

Guidance, information and best practices have been characterized by territorial thinking with concentration on national health system and social contexts. Information was to a large extent provided from global entities such as the World Health Organization (WHO), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and others. This bipolar response mechanism came to the detriment of regional and sub-regional levels. The development of the global pandemic was evaluated in terms of the performance of single countries without trying to reflect on possible regional or sub-regional results of similar characteristics in health system and social contexts. To have a clearer view of the issue of sub-regional similarities, we examined the WHO, Eastern Mediterranean Region. When examining the development of confirmed cases for countries in the region, we identified four different sub-groups similar in the development of the pandemic and the social distancing measure implemented. Despite the complicated situation, these groups gave space for thinking outside the box of traditional outbreaks or pandemic response. We think that this sub-regional approach could be very effective in addressing more characteristics and not geographically based analysis. Furthermore, this can be an area of additional conceptual approaches, modelling and concrete platforms for information and lessons learned exchange.","Ali Maher, Osama; Elamein Boshara, Mohamed Abdalla; Pichierri, Giuseppe; Cegolon, Luca; Panu Napodano, Catello Mario; Murgia, Paola; Bellizzi, Saverio",Journal of infection in developing countries,198,16

Lifestyle programmes targeting former athletes who have gained substantial fat mass (FM) postsports career are lacking. We studied the effects of the Champ4Life programme on body composition and other health-related outcomes in former elite athletes with overweight or obesity. METHODS Ninety-four former athletes(42.4±7.3 y, 34.0% female) were recruited and randomly assigned to either an intervention group (IG; n=49) or a control group (CG; n=45). The IG attended 12 educational sessions addressing physical activity, weight management and nutrition. They also had a nutrition appointment aimed to prescribe a moderate caloric deficit(~300-500 kcal/day). Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry was used to assess body composition. The Short-Form Health Survey-36 questionnaire was used to measure general health-related quality of life. Blood samples were collected to assess cardiometabolic health parameters. RESULTS At 12 months, the IG lost more weight (estimated difference (ED)=-5.3 kg; -6.9 to -3.8), total FM (ED=-4.1 kg; -5.4 to -2.8) and abdominal FM (ED=-0.49 kg; -0.64 to -0.33) than did the CG (p's<0.001). Cardiometabolic health markers also improved significantly (p<0.05) more in the IG at 12 months (insulin (ED=-4.9 μU/mL;-8.0 to -1.8); homoeostatic model assessment (ED=-1.2; -2.1 to -0.4); total cholesterol (ED=-21.8 mg/dL; -35.4 to -8.2); low-density lipoprotein (ED=18.2 mg/dL;-29.2 to -7.1)), as did quality-of-life dimensions (physical functioning (ED=11.7; 6.5 to 16.9); physical role (ED=17.6; 2.1 to 33.0); general health (ED=19.4; 11.4 to 27.4); vitality (ED=13.3; 5.3 to 21.3) and mental health (ED=12.3; 4.1 to 20.6)). CONCLUSIONS The Champ4Life programme was effective in substantially reducing total and abdominal FM while preserving fat-free mass and improving health-related markers. These findings will enable evidence-based decisions when implementing lifestyle interventions targeting retired elite athletes.

METHODS In a single-blind, randomized, controlled trial among women undergoing outpatient laparoscopic hysterectomy, patients were randomly assigned to a backfill-assisted void trial or a trial of spontaneous voiding. The primary outcome was time to discharge assessed by length of time spent in the postanesthesia care unit. Secondary outcomes included time to first spontaneous void, urinary retention rates, and postoperative complications within 8 weeks. We estimated that 152 patients (76/group) would provide greater than 80% power to identify a 30-minute difference in the primary outcome with a SD of 56 minutes and a two-sided α of 0.05. RESULTS Between June 2017 to May 2018, 202 women were screened, 162 women were randomized, and results were analyzed for 153 women. Seventy-five patients (group A) who had a backfill-assisted voiding trial and 78 patients (group B) who had a spontaneous voiding trial were included in the analysis. The mean time to discharge was 273.4 minutes for group A vs 283.2 minutes for group B, which was not found to be significant (P=.45). The mean time to first spontaneous void was 181.1 minutes in group A vs 206.0 minutes in group B. There was a statistically significant reduction of 24.9 minutes in time to first spontaneous void with patients randomized to the backfill group (P=.04). Five of 75 patients (6.7%) in group A and 10 of 78 patients (12.8%) in group B developed urinary retention postoperatively and required recatheterization before discharge, which was also not significant (P=.20). CONCLUSION Bladder filling before removing the Foley catheter is a simple procedure shown to reduce time to first spontaneous void, but not time to discharge in patients undergoing outpatient laparoscopic hysterectomy.

RECENT FINDINGS Critical illness demands objective, targeted nutritional therapy to prevent adverse effects of underfeeding/over feeding. Thus, all recent societal guidelines recommend indirect calorimetry use to determine energy needs. Very recently, indirect calorimetry technology has finally evolved to allow for accurate, simple, and routine utilization in a wider range of ICU patients. Recent data continues to confirm poor correlation between measured and equation-predicted energy expenditure emphasizing need for indirect calorimetry to be standard of care. This may be particularly true in COVID-19, where significant progressive hypermetabolism and variability in energy expenditure has been shown. Metabolic physiology can change frequently during ICU stay in response to changes in clinical condition or care. Thus, repeated longitudinal indirect calorimetry measures are needed throughout ICU stay to optimize care, with initial data showing improved clinical outcomes when indirect calorimetry targets are utilized. SUMMARY Personalized ICU care demands objective data to guide therapy. This includes use of indirect calorimetry to determine energy expenditure and guide ICU nutrition therapy. Long-awaited new innovations in indirect calorimetry technology should finally lead to indirect calorimetry to becoming a fundamental component of modern ICU standard of care and clinical research moving forward.","De Waele, Elisabeth; Jonckheer, Joop; Wischmeyer, Paul",Current opinion in critical care,198,1

This study investigated the phenotypic and genotypic diversity of the nodule-forming rhizobial bacteria recovered from Pisum sativum subsp., Cicer pinnatifidum, and Lens culinaris subsp. orientalis exhibiting natural distribution in the Gaziantep province of Turkey. PCA analyses of rhizobial isolates, which were tested to be highly resistant to stress conditions, showed that especially pH and salt concentrations had an important effect on these bacteria. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA determined that these wild species were nodulated by at least 7 groups including Rhizobium and non-Rhizobium. The largest group comprised of Rhizobium leguminosarum and Rhizobium sp. while R. pusense, which was previously determined as non-symbiotic species, was found to nodulate C. pinnatifidum and L. culinaris subsp. orientalis. In recent studies, Klebsiella sp., which is stated to be able to nodulate different species, strong evidences have been obtained in present study exhibiting that Klebsiella sp. can nodulate C. pinnatifidum and Pseudomonas sp. was able to nodulate C. pinnatifidum and P. sativum subsp. Additionally, L. culinaris subsp. orientalis unlike other plant species, was nodulated by Burkholderia sp. and Serratia sp. associated isolates. Some isolates could not be characterized at the species level since the 16S rRNA sequence similarity rate was low and the fact that they were in a separate group supported with high bootstrap values in the phylogenetic tree may indicate that these isolates could be new species. The REP-PCR fingerprinting provided results supporting the existence of new species nodulating wild ancestors.","Basbuga, Sevil; Basbuga, Selcuk; Yayla, Fatih; Mahmoud, Ahmed M; Can, Canan",International microbiology : the official journal of the Spanish Society for Microbiology,198,30

Individual self-explanations refer to an act of metacognition in which students, after having processed a certain amount of information, attempt to explain their understanding to themselves of what was just learned. Dyadic-explanations refer to the same process, but instead of explaining to oneself, the student explains his/her understanding to another student. METHOD An experiment was conducted in which 120 medical students studied a video-recorded lecture on the role of protein synthesis inhibition on memory reconsolidation. Participants were randomly allocated to one of four conditions: (1) a control condition in which they listened to the lecture once; (2) a control condition in which they listened to the lecture twice; (3) an experimental condition in which they had to listen to the lecture and provide self-explanations individually; and (4) an experimental condition in which they had to listen to the lecture and provide dyadic-explanations. Participants' knowledge regarding the topic was measured three times; at the start and end of the experiment, and one week after the experiment to determine knowledge retention. Data were analysed by means of a 2*2 and 4*3 repeated-measures ANOVA. RESULTS The results suggest that participants who engaged in individual self- or dyadic-explanations significantly outperformed participants in the two control conditions in terms of learning and retention (F = 5.67, Wilks Λ = 0.94, P = 0.019, η2 = 0.05). Moreover, the results suggest that dyadic-explanations were more effective than individual self-explanations (F = 3.70, Wilks Λ = 0.83, P = 0.002, η2 = 0.09). CONCLUSIONS These outcomes suggest that encouraging students to work in pairs or in small teams to prepare for a learning event results in superior preparation and learning.","Rotgans, Jerome I; Cleland, Jennifer A",Medical education,198,1

METHODS Novices, intermediates, advanced, and experts performed a video-recorded polypectomy task using the Welsh Institute for Minimal Access Therapy (WIMAT) colonoscopy suitcase simulator. This involved removal of a simple polyp (A) and a complex polyp (B). Participants self-assessed themselves using a Direct Observation of Polypectomy Skills (DOPyS) assessment form. Two blinded, independent, Joint Advisory Group on Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (JAG) accredited assessors graded each performance using the same DOPyS scoring. The Spearman coefficient was used to determine the correlation between self and assessors' scores. RESULTS Eighty participants completed the task. There was a weak correlation between assessors' scores and self-assessment scores for all groups (novices: ρ = -.44, P = .85; intermediates: ρ = -.16, P = .51; advanced: ρ = .16, P = .50; and experts: ρ = .07, P = .76).

We hypothesized that acute normobaric hypoxia would induce a negative net protein balance by repressing anabolic and activating proteolytic signaling pathways at rest and postexercise and that those changes could be partially genetically determined. Eleven monozygotic twins participated in an experimental trial in normoxia and hypoxia (10.7% O2). Muscle biopsy samples were obtained before and after a 20-min moderate cycling exercise. In hypoxia at rest, autophagic flux was increased, as indicated by an increased microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 type II/I (LC3-II/I) ratio (+25%) and LC3-II expression (+60%) and decreased p62/SQSTM1 expression (-25%; P<0.05), whereas exercise reversed those changes to a level similar to that with normoxia except for p62/SQSTM1, which was further decreased (P<0.05). Hypoxia also increased Bnip3 (+34%) and MAFbx (+18%) mRNA levels as well as REDD1 expression (+439%) and AMP-activated protein kinase phosphorylation (+22%; P<0.05). Among the molecular responses to hypoxia and/or exercise, high monozygotic similarity was found for REDD1, LC3-II, and LC3-II/I (P<0.05). Our results indicate that environmental hypoxia modulates protein metabolism at rest and after moderate exercise by primarily increasing markers of protein breakdown and, more specifically, markers of the autophagy-lysosomal system, with a modest genetic contribution.","Masschelein, Evi; Van Thienen, Ruud; D'Hulst, Gommaar; Hespel, Peter; Thomis, Martine; Deldicque, Louise",FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,198,1

The preliminary safety of transanal minimally invasive surgery (TAMIS) has been demonstrated, but the reported experience with upper rectal tumors is limited. The incidence and management of peritoneal entry during transanal endoscopic surgery across various platforms have not been previously evaluated. METHODS Retrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained database of all transanal endoscopic resections performed at a single institution between January 2008 and December 2014 was conducted. Cases with and without peritoneal entry were evaluated with respect to transanal platform used, surgical indication, size, location and distance from the anal verge, and incidence of postoperative complications. RESULTS A total of 78 transanal endoscopic procedures were performed on 76 patients using the rigid transanal endoscopic operation (TEO, 65.4 %), TEM (26.9 %), and TAMIS platform (7.7 %). The most common surgical indication included endoscopically unresectable adenomas (50 %). The average distance of lesions from the anal verge (AV) was 9.6 cm (range 4-20 cm). Peritoneal entry occurred in 22 cases (28.2 %). Platform used (TAMIS vs. rigid, p < 0.05), mean distance from the AV (p < 0.0001), location along the rectum (p = 0.01), and mean specimen size (p = 0.01) were associated with a higher likelihood of peritoneal entry. All rectal defects associated with peritoneal entry were successfully closed transanally except for two (TEM and TEO) cases that required conversion to laparoscopic low anterior resection and laparoscopic Hartmann's, respectively. There were four TAMIS cases that required conversion to TEO platforms. CONCLUSION In this high-risk TEM, TEO, and TAMIS series (one-third of rectal lesions located in the upper rectum), 91 % of all peritoneal entries were managed transanally without increased morbidity. TAMIS for upper rectal lesions was associated with a high risk of complicated peritoneal entry requiring conversion to a rigid platform.","Molina, George; Bordeianou, Liliana; Shellito, Paul; Sylla, Patricia",Surgical endoscopy,198,30

AIM We used the needle grasper in SILC to hang and manipulate the gallbladder. MATERIAL AND METHODS Sixty-five patients (43 female, 22 male) who underwent SILC between December 2013 and December 2014 were analyzed retrospectively for patient demographics, duration of operation, laparotomy or conventional laparoscopy necessity, drain use, complications, and hospital stay periods. To place the SILC port (Covidien, Inc.), the needle grasper was inserted at the right upper abdominal quadrant without an incision to hang and manipulate the gall-bladder. RESULTS The mean age was 47.9 ±13.068 years; the mean body mass index (BMI) was 26.94 ±3.913 kg/m2. ASA scores were 1, 2, and 3. Two patients with high BMI with additional trocar use were excluded. The operations were completed without any additional trocar in 59 patients. The mean operation time was 89 ±22.41 min. Eighteen patients required a drain; all were discharged after drain removal. One patient needed re-hospitalization and percutaneous drainage and was discharged on the 9th day. Fifty-three patients were discharged on the 1st post-operative day. Eleven patients with drains were discharged on the 2nd day, and 1 was discharged on the 7th day. The mean hospital stay period was 1.26 ±0.815 days. CONCLUSIONS The main difficulty of SILC is to manipulate hand tools because the triangulation principle of laparoscopy use is not possible in SILC. Inserting a needle grasper into the abdominal cavity at the right subcostal area to manipulate the gallbladder helps and does not leave a visible scar.","Donmez, Turgut; Uzman, Sinan; Ferahman, Sina; Demiryas, Suleyman; Hatipoglu, Engin; Uludag, Server Sezgin; Yildirim, Dogan",Wideochirurgia i inne techniki maloinwazyjne = Videosurgery and other miniinvasive techniques,198,1

We aimed to describe the worldwide COVID-19 clinical research response and its evolution over the first 100 days of the pandemic. Methods: Descriptive analysis of planned, ongoing or completed trials by April 9, 2020 testing any intervention to treat or prevent COVID-19, systematically identified in trial registries, preprint servers, and literature databases. A survey was conducted of all trials to assess their recruitment status up to July 6, 2020. Results: Most of the 689 trials (overall target sample size 396,366) were small (median sample size 120; interquartile range [IQR] 60-300) but randomized (75.8%; n=522) and were often conducted in China (51.1%; n=352) or the USA (11%; n=76). 525 trials (76.2%) planned to include 155,571 hospitalized patients, and 25 (3.6%) planned to include 96,821 health-care workers. Treatments were evaluated in 607 trials (88.1%), frequently antivirals (n=144) or antimalarials (n=112); 78 trials (11.3%) focused on prevention, including 14 vaccine trials. No trial investigated social distancing. Interventions tested in 11 trials with >5,000 participants were also tested in 169 smaller trials (median sample size 273; IQR 90-700). Hydroxychloroquine alone was investigated in 110 trials. While 414 trials (60.0%) expected completion in 2020, only 35 trials (4.1%; 3,071 participants) were completed by July 6. Of 112 trials with detailed recruitment information, 55 had recruited <20% of the targeted sample; 27 between 20-50%; and 30 over 50% (median 14.8% [IQR 2.0-62.0%]). Conclusions: The size and speed of the COVID-19 clinical trials agenda is unprecedented. However, most trials were small investigating a small fraction of treatment options. The feasibility of this research agenda is questionable, and many trials may end in futility, wasting research resources. Much better coordination is needed to respond to global health threats.","Janiaud, Perrine; Axfors, Cathrine; Van't Hooft, Janneke; Saccilotto, Ramon; Agarwal, Arnav; Appenzeller-Herzog, Christian; Contopoulos-Ioannidis, Despina G; Danchev, Valentin; Dirnagl, Ulrich; Ewald, Hannah; Gartlehner, Gerald; Goodman, Steven N; Haber, Noah A; Ioannidis, Angeliki Diotima; Ioannidis, John P A; Lythgoe, Mark P; Ma, Wenyan; Macleod, Malcolm; Malički, Mario; Meerpohl, Joerg J; Min, Yan; Moher, David; Nagavci, Blin; Naudet, Florian; Pauli-Magnus, Christiane; O'Sullivan, Jack W; Riedel, Nico; Roth, Jan A; Sauermann, Mandy; Schandelmaier, Stefan; Schmitt, Andreas M; Speich, Benjamin; Williamson, Paula R; Hemkens, Lars G",F1000Research,198,1

This development is reproducible in Ray's fluid thioglycollate medium (RFTM). In this study, supplementation with tissue extract from a host, the Manila clam, significantly improved the efficiency of development, as determined by the numbers and sizes of developed prezoosporangia. Similar results were seen following supplementation with boiled host tissue extract, which indicates that a thermally stable component of the host is required for the parasite's development. Subsequently, we found that a commercially available lipid concentrate significantly increased prezoosporulation without host tissue, suggesting that the lipids in host tissue enhance prezoosporangia development. Moreover, we determined that yeast extract, sodium thioglycolate, and sodium chloride were the only components of RFTM required for prezoosporulation. Based on these findings, we prepared a simple, host-free medium for P. olseni prezoosporulation-Lipid concentrate Yeast extract Medium (LpcYM)-consisting of yeast extract, lipid concentrate, sodium thioglycolate, and sodium chloride. We confirmed that the prezoosporangia developed in LpcYM produce zoospores that are infectious to Manila clams and that trophozoites of other Perkinsus species (P. marinus, P. honshuensis, and P. chesapeaki) also develop to prezoosporangia in this host-free medium. As LpcYM has the simplest composition of prezoosporulation media available thus far, it enables us to conduct molecular and biochemical studies examining the drastic transformation process of this parasite.","Maeda, Kazuki; Yoshinaga, Tomoyoshi; Itoh, Naoki",Parasitology international,198,16

In a longitudinal experiment, the thermal sensations of a relatively small number of subjects over different environmental conditions are followed and evaluated. This allows an exploration of the effects of changing climatic conditions on thermal sensation, and thus can provide information that is not possible to acquire through the conventional transverse survey. The paper addresses the effects of changing wind and solar radiation conditions on thermal sensation. It examines the use of predicted mean vote (PMV) in the outdoor context and illustrates the use of an alternative thermal index--physiological equivalent temperature (PET). The paper supports the conventional assumption that thermal neutrality corresponds to thermal comfort. Finally, predictive formulas for estimating outdoor thermal sensation are presented as functions of air temperature, wind speed, solar radiation intensity and absolute humidity. According to the formulas, for a person in light clothing sitting under shade on a typical summer day in Hong Kong where the air temperature is about 28°C and relative humidity about 80%, a wind speed of about 1.6 m/s is needed to achieve neutral thermal sensation.","Cheng, Vicky; Ng, Edward; Chan, Cecilia; Givoni, Baruch",International journal of biometeorology,198,17

The aim was: to evaluate the frequency of different diagnoses made in a new emergency department to define relevant healthcare requirements; and to find out if in-hospital mortality rates would decrease after the implementation of the emergency department. METHODS In this observational study, we prospectively collated diagnoses of all patients presenting to the emergency department of the St Francis Referral Hospital in Ifakara, Tanzania during 1 year. In addition, we compared in-hospital mortality rates before and after the implementation of the emergency department. RESULTS From July 2016 through to June 2017, a total of 35,903 patients were included. The median age was 33.6 years (range 1 day to 100 years), 57% were female, 25% were children <5 years, 4% were pregnant and 9% were hospitalised. The most common diagnoses were respiratory tract infection (12.6%), urinary tract infection (11.4%), trauma (9.8%), undifferentiated febrile illness (5.4%), and malaria (5.2%). The most common clinical diagnoses per age group were: lower respiratory tract infection (16.1%) in children <5 years old; trauma (21.6%) in 5- to 17-year-olds; urinary tract infection (13.5%) in 18- to 50-year-olds; and hypertensive emergency (12.4%) in >50-year-olds. Respiratory tract infections peaked in April during the rainy season, whereas malaria peaked 3 months after the rainy season. In-hospital mortality rates did not decrease during the study period (5.6% in 2015 vs 7.6% in 2017). CONCLUSIONS The majority of diagnosed disorders were of infectious or traumatic origin.

The local and systemic injury that ensues after reperfusion of ischemic skeletal muscle is an important clinical problem in flap surgery. Flap delay may be applied chemically or sympathetically. Early use of botulinum toxin A (Btx-A) in muscle flap surgery relied on chemical denervation; however, in our study, we tried to emphasize a possible chemical delay mechanism of Btx-A, through the release of substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). METHODS Pretreatment with perivascular or intramuscular Btx-A was applied 1 week before the flap elevation, 3.5 units in 2 experimental groups each containing 8 Sprague-Dawley rats. The control groups (2 groups, each containing 8 rats) received 0.07 mL saline perivascularly and intramuscularly. The right gastrocnemius muscle flap was used as the experimental model. Ischemia-reperfusion cycle was applied to all groups. On the seventh day, the gastrocnemius flap was elevated, and perivascular tissues were observed macroscopically. Comparisons between perivascular Btx-A and intramuscular Btx-A groups were made, and the animals were killed. Muscle biopsies were taken. Damaged myocytes were counted using McCormack technique, and chemical delay was shown as angiogenesis, lymphocyte counts, and edema formation with VEGF3-R, CGRP, and substance P markers as immunohistochemical staining. RESULTS The amount of muscle necrosis was the highest in intramuscular Btx-A admitted groups. The intramuscular and perivascular Btx-A groups showed significant angiogenesis scored blindly by the senior pathologist. CONCLUSIONS Potential role of Btx-A in ischemic preconditioning of muscle flaps achieved through the release of substance P, CGRP, and VEGF was investigated. Chemical delay was shown objectively by Btx-applied groups.","Akcal, Arzu; Sevim, K Zeynep; Yesilada, Aysin; Kiyak, Volkan; Sucu, D Ozgur; Tatlidede, H Soner; Sakiz, Damlanur; Kaya, Huseyin",The Journal of craniofacial surgery,198,16

METHODS The study sample consisted of APL survivors (n=244), with a median time from diagnosis of 14.3 years (IQR=11.1-16.9 years), previously enrolled in a long-term follow-up study. Symptom severity and symptom interference were assessed using the well-validated MD Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI). Fatigue was evaluated with the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue questionnaire. RESULTS Higher fatigue burden was associated with increased affective symptoms, memory problems, drowsiness, sleep disturbances, shortness of breath and pain. Higher levels of fatigue were also associated with higher scores across all interference items of the MDASI. Overall, symptoms interfered most with mood, but among APL survivors with high levels of fatigue, symptoms interfered most with enjoyment of life. Multivariable regression analysis confirmed the independent association between fatigue and all symptom severity items of the MDASI. CONCLUSIONS The current findings show that long-term APL survivors who report higher fatigue also experience a greater overall symptom burden and a substantial impact on performance of daily activities. Further studies are needed to examine whether interventions aimed at reducing fatigue could also reduce overall symptom burden.","Sommer, Kathrin; Vignetti, Marco; Cottone, Francesco; Breccia, Massimo; Annibali, Ombretta; Luppi, Mario; Intermesoli, Tamara; Borlenghi, Erika; Carluccio, Paola; Rodeghiero, Francesco; Fabbiano, Francesco; Romani, Claudio; Sborgia, Marco; Martino, Bruno; Crugnola, Monica; Efficace, Fabio",BMJ supportive & palliative care,198,24

Despite the current focus of worldwide research being the characterization of post-COVID-19 sequelae, the level of functional impact that this disease causes in the elderly who have presented moderate, severe or critical manifestations is still unknown. Objective: To identify the main consequences/sequelae on functional respiratory capacity in the elderly after CoViD-19. Methodology: A cross-sectional study was carried out in the community. Functional aerobic capacity (2min step test), dyspnea perception (modified Medical Research Council Dyspnea Questionnaire), respiratory and peripheral muscle strength (maximum inspiratory and expiratory pressure, grip strength) and the Frailty Index (Clinical Fragility Scale) were assessed in 25 community-dwelling individuals aged [≥]65 years, who have had a diagnosis of CoViD-19 for up to 6 months, and in an equal number of elderly people with the same characteristics without a known diagnosis of CoViD-19. Results: The elderly with a diagnosis of CoViD-19 up to 6 months presented a decrease in the values of maximum inspiratory pressure (p=0.001) and maximum expiratory pressure (p=0.015), in aerobic capacity (p<0.001) with significant presence of desaturation on exertion (p<0.001), and increased values of dyspnea perception (p=0.001) and Frailty Index (p=0.026). Conclusion: Significant changes were found in the functional respiratory capacity of elderly patients diagnosed with CoViD-19 for up to 6 months, when compared with elderly individuals without a known diagnosis of CoViD-19. It is not possible to extrapolate the results obtained to the Portuguese population, however these results may be an important indicator in the characterization of sequelae in the elderly after infection by SARS-CoV-2.

Rather, Cranford excels in highlighting complex processes of racialized labour markets, which tend to funnel migrant women into precarious personal support work (e.g., Chapter 1);in drawing out intersecting axes of marginalization shaping home care clients/consumers’ desire for flexibility (Chapter 2);and in demonstrating how programs that enhance labour market flexibility, especially when inadequately funded, can erode the employment security of a gendered and racialized workforce, leaving both clients/consumers and workers on their own to negotiate everyday relational tensions over knowledge, skill, time, and tasks. Cranford’s work is significant in the context of COVID-19, supporting calls that have been made during this time for increased attention to and funding for the home care sector, a sector that has seen decades of cutbacks or lack of increases in funding as it is increasingly being relied on to meet post-acute needs as well as to respond to the expectations and preferences for people to live at home for longer.","Funk, Laura M.",Canadian Journal on Aging,198,8

An adapted model, primarily based on the Protection Motivation Theory (PMT), is proposed and evaluated using data collected from an online survey of 222 respondents from a Higher Education institution. Data analysis was performed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM). The results confirm the applicability of PMT in the security context. Respondents’ behavioural intention, perceived threat vulnerability, response cost, response efficacy, security habits, and subjective norm predicted self-reported security behaviour. In contrast, environmental uncertainty, attitude towards policy compliance, self-efficacy and perceived threat severity did not significantly impact behavioural intention.

The survey included respondent demographic characteristics, child health, child health promotion related to malaria knowledge, water and sanitation, and health services access. Majority of our respondents were women (89.41%) and had never been to school (71.18%). Slightly more than half the children were reported to have ever had malaria and 45% reported to have ever had diarrhea. We did not find any statistically significant association between gender or level of education and malaria knowledge. Eighty six percent of respondents had received a free bednet during national campaigns and 61% slept under a bednet the night before the survey. We found a statistically significant association between receiving information on malaria prevention and sleeping under a bednet. There was no statistically significant association between drinking water source and malaria or diarrhea. Both malaria and diarrhea were considered to be serious illnesses for adults and children by nearly all respondents. Insights from our detailed KAP survey can guide policy makers and practitioners who design and implement malaria control and prevention measures in Guinea.","Holsted, E.; Kadiebwe, B.; Sattar, A.; Salthouse, A.; Ravi, N.",,198,1

The activity and safety of vodobatinib was evaluated in ponatinib treated (PT) and ponatinib naïve (PN) chronic phase (CP)-CML subjects in an exploratory analysis. Methods: Multiple escalating doses of vodobatinib (once daily) in 28-day cycles were evaluated in a 3+3 study design. The primary objective was determination of the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) along with safety and a secondary objective was to evaluate anti-leukemic activity. Dose escalation involved dose doubling until 2 pts in a cohort experienced Grade 2 toxicity, or 1 pt experienced Grade 3 or 4 toxicity, after which dose escalation was reduced to 40% increments. Treatment continued until unacceptable toxicity, disease progression (PD), consent withdrawal, or death. Results: As of 15 Jul 2020, 31 CP-CML pts received vodobatinib at doses of 12 to 240 mg;16 pts (9 males) in ponatinib treated (PT) cohort [7 (44%) ponatinib was the immediate prior TKI] and 15 pts (7 males) in the ponatinib naïve (PN) cohort. The baseline demographics and disease history are represented in Table 1. Efficacy: Median duration of treatment was 17.3 (0.6-36) and 14.8 (0.5- 42) months in the Ponatinib treated and naive groups, respectively;11 pts in the PT group [2 in Deep molecular response (DMR), 3 in MMR;5 in MCyR (2 in CCyR and 3 in PCyR);1 in stable disease] and 10 pts in the PN group (2 in DMR, 4 in MMR and 3 in CCyR, 1 in stable disease) are continuing on treatment. Overall efficacy outcomes are included in Tables 2 and 3. Of 16 PT pts, 2 (13%) pts, both with double mutations, had disease progression. Of 15 PN pts, 4 (26%) pts (with baseline mutation of T315I at 48 mg, Y253H at 66 mg, F317L and E255V mutation at 174 mg) progressed. Safety: In ponatinib treated pts, the most commonly reported treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs), (all grades) included nausea (4, 25%) and diarrhea (3, 25%). Other commonly reported TEAEs included thrombocytopenia (3, 19%), rash (3, 19%), non-cardiac chest pain (3, 19%), increased amylase (3, 19%), and fall (3, 19%). Grade ≥ 3 TEAEs were reported in 10 (63%) pts included 1 pt each with anemia, lymphopenia, fall, skull fracture, spinal fracture, lipase increase, fluid overload, syncope, dyspnea, and hypertension. Vodobatinib related AEs included amylase increase, lipase increase, dyspnea, fluid overload, thrombocytopenia and neutropenia. Grade ≥ 3 TEAEs reported in more than one pt included neutropenia (2, 13%) amylase increase (2, 13%) and thrombocytopenia (2, 13%). In PN pts, the most commonly reported TEAEs (all grades) included myalgia (5, 33%) and back pain (4, 27%). Other commonly reported TEAEs were thrombocytopenia (4, 27%), and nasopharyngitis (3, 20%).Grade ≥ 3 TEAEs were reported in 7 (47%) pts (1 pt with anemia, 1 pt with pneumonia, 1 pt with neutropenia, 1 pt with gout, hypokalemia, thrombocytopenia, 1 pt with increased liver and pancreatic enzymes and 1 pt each with dementia and amnesia. Vodobatinib related AEs included alanine aminotransferase increase, blood bilirubin increased, amnesia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. No grade ≥ 3 event was reported in more than 1 pt. Overall, three cardiovascular TEAEs were reported, in 2 pts (1 each in PT and PN), all deemed unrelated to vodobatinib. Three pts died on study: 1 due to disease progression in the PT group;1 due to pneumonia (suspected COVID-19) and 1 due to intracranial hemorrhage in the PN group. The intracranial hemorrhage event (Grade 5 AE) was considered possibly related and was confounded by disease progression to blast phase that included extra-medullary sites. At the highest dose of 240 mg, two dose limiting toxicities were reported. The next lower dose level of 204 mg was est blished as MTD with a favorable safety profile in heavily pre-treated CP-CML pts. Conclusion: Vodobatinib was evaluated over 9 escalating doses. Comparable and promising efficacy was noted in both PT (50% CCyR) and PN (67% CCyR) groups, meriting further study of vodobatinib as a potential new agent for treatment of previously treated CP-CML.

Narrative review of reports of EU-15 countries,18.59918,2.288733,2021,"Abstract Impact hammer experiments are typically used for identifying the Frequency Response Function (FRF) of six-degree-of-freedom (6-dof) industrial robots for machining applications. However, the modal properties of 6-dof industrial robots change as a function of robot arm configuration. Hence, describing the robot’s modal parameters within its workspace requires off-line impact hammer experiments performed at discrete robot end effector positions, which are costly and time consuming. Instead, it is more efficient to calculate the robot FRF using Operational Modal Analysis (OMA), a method that utilizes data acquired during the actual machining process. This paper presents an OMA approach to identify the robot FRF from measured milling forces and robot tool tip vibrations. Analysis of the milling process data reveal that periodic forces produced in the milling process are accompanied by background white noise that induce broadband excitation across the robot structure’s frequency spectrum. Hence, the tool tip vibration signal contains the signature of the structure’s free response that enables the use of OMA to estimate the robot’s FRF. The FRF calculated using OMA is shown to be in good agreement with results obtained from impact hammer experiments.","Nguyen, Vinh; Melkote, Shreyes N.",Procedia Manufacturing,198,1

An exploratory survey of faculty,18.260626,2.446386,2021-09-10,"Many complex diseases are expressed with high incidence only in certain populations. Genealogy studies determine that these diseases are inherited with a high probability. However, genetic studies have been unable to identify the genomic signatures responsible for such heritability, as identifying the genetic variants that make a population prone to a given disease is not enough to explain its high occurrence within the population. This gap is known as the missing heritability problem. We know that the microbiota plays a very important role in determining many important phenotypic characteristics of its host, in particular, the complex diseases for which the missing heritability occurs. Therefore, when computing the heritability of a phenotype it is important to consider not only the genetic variation in the host but also in its microbiota. Here we test this hypothesis by studying an evolutionary model based on gene regulatory networks. Our results show that the holobiont (the host plus its microbiota) is capable of generating a much larger variability than the host alone, greatly reducing the missing heritability of the phenotype. This result strongly suggests that a considerably large part of the missing heritability can be attributed to the microbiome.","Huitzil, Saúl; Sandoval-Motta, Santiago; Frank, Alejandro; Aldana, Maximino",bioRxiv,198,20

We report that out of 491 SLE patients, 66 had detectable anti-IFN-auto-Abs. The presence of neutralizing anti-IFN- auto-Abs correlates with lower levels of circulating IFN protein, inhibition of IFN down- stream signalling molecules and gene signatures and with an inactive global disease score. Previously reported B cell frequency abnormalities, found to be involved in SLE pathogenesis, including increased levels of immature, double negative and plasmablast B cell populations were partially normalized in patients with neutralising anti-IFN-auto- Abs compared to other patient groups. We also show that sera from SLE patients with neutralising anti-IFN-auto-Abs biases in vitro B cell differentiation towards classical memory phenotype, while sera from patients without anti-IFN-Abs drives plasmablasts differentiation. Our findings support a role for neutralising anti-IFN-auto-Abs in controlling SLE pathogenesis and highlight their potential efficacy as novel therapy.","Bradford, H.

However, for any given BMI, individuals vary substantially in fat distribution. The clinical implications of this variability are not fully understood. Methods We studied MRI imaging data of 40,032 UK Biobank participants. Using previously quantified visceral (VAT), abdominal subcutaneous (ASAT), and gluteofemoral (GFAT) adipose tissue volume in up to 9,041 to train convolutional neural networks, we quantified these depots in the remainder of the participants. We derived new metrics for each adipose depot - fully independent of BMI - by quantifying deviation from values predicted by BMI (e.g. VAT adjusted for BMI, VATadjBMI) and determined associations with cardiometabolic diseases. Results Machine learning models based on two-dimensional projection images enabled near-perfect estimation of VAT, ASAT, and GFAT, with r2 in a holdout testing dataset >0.97 for each. Using the newly derived measures of local adiposity - residualized based on BMI - we note marked heterogeneity in associations with cardiometabolic diseases. Taking presence of type 2 diabetes as an example, VATadjBMI was associated with significantly increased risk (odds ratio per standard deviation increase (OR/SD) 1.49; 95%CI: 1.43-1.55), while ASATadjBMI was largely neutral (OR/SD 1.08; 95%CI: 1.03-1.14) and GFATadjBMI conferred protection (OR/SD 0.75; 95%CI: 0.71-0.79). Similar patterns were observed for coronary artery disease. Conclusions For any given BMI, measures of local adiposity have variable and divergent associations with cardiometabolic diseases.","Agrawal, S.; Klarqvist, M. D. R.; Diamant, N.; Ellinor, P.

Dental aerosols and droplets contain oral microbes and there is therefore potential for major disruption to dental services during infectious disease outbreaks. One method to control hazardous aerosols often used in industry is Local Exhaust Ventilation (LEV). The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of LEV on aerosols and droplets produced during dental procedures. Experiments were conducted on dental mannequins in an 825.4 m3 open plan clinic, and a 49.3 m3 single surgery. 10-minute crown preparations were performed with an air-turbine handpiece in the open plan clinic, and 10-minute full mouth ultrasonic scaling in the single surgery. Fluorescein was added to instrument irrigation reservoirs as a tracer. In both settings, Optical Particle Counters (OPCs) were used to measure aerosol particles between 0.3 - 10.0 m and liquid cyclone air samplers were used to capture aerosolised fluorescein tracer. Additionally, in the open plan setting fluorescein tracer was captured by passive settling onto filter papers in the environment. Tracer was quantified fluorometrically. An LEV device with High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filtration and a flow rate of 5,000 L/min was used. LEV reduced aerosol production from the air-turbine handpiece by 90% within 0.5 m, and this was 99% for the ultrasonic scaler. OPC particle counts were substantially reduced for both procedures, and air-turbine settled droplet detection reduced by 95% within 0.5 m. The effect of LEV was substantially greater than suction alone for the air-turbine and was similar to the effect of suction for the ultrasonic scaler. LEV reduces aerosol and droplet contamination from dental procedures by at least 90% in the breathing zone of the operator and it is therefore a valuable tool to reduce the dispersion of dental aerosols.","Allison, J.

Some protein mutations stabilize oxidized (Fe3+) state (Methemoglobin, Hb M) causing methemoglobinemia and can be lethal above 30 %. Majority of the analyses of factors influencing Hb oxidation are retrospective and give insights only for inner sphere mutations of Heme (His58, His87). Herein, we report the first all atom MD simulations on redox states and calculations of the Marcus ET parameters for the α-chain Hb oxidation and reduction rates for Hb M. The Hb (wild type), and most of the studied α-chain variants maintain globin structure except the Hb M Iwate (H87Y). Using linear response approximation we calculated average energy gaps (), total (λ), protein (λprot), solvent (λsolv) reorganization energies, and redox potentials (E°), and oxidation free energies (ΔG°). The total λ ranges from 0.685 – 0.730 eV in agreement with literature on Hb and similar Heme proteins. The mutants forming Hb M tend to lower the E° and thus stabilize the oxidized (Fe3+) state (e.g. the Hb Miyagi variant with K61E mutation). Solvent reorganization (λsolv 73 – 96 %) makes major contributions to λ, while protein reorganization (λprot) accounts for 27 – 30 % except for the Miyagi and J-Buda variants (λprot ∼ 4 %). Analysis of Heme-solvent H-bonding interactions among variants provide insights into the role of Lys61 residue in stabilizing Fe2+ state and ET parameters. The ET parameters provide valuable insights into the Hb oxidation to Hb M in agreement with the experimental data. Thus our methodology explains the effect of mutations on the structure, stability and Hb oxidation, and has potential for the prediction of methemoglobinemia.","Dixit, Vaibhav A.; Blumberger, Jochen; Vyas, Shivam Kumar",bioRxiv,198,25

We use a text mining approach to overcome limitations, such as the lack of objectivity and accuracy of the classification of topics in manual text analysis for North Korean studies. Contrary to the conventional assumption that the North Korean economic policies are driven by dogmatic Juche (self-reliance) ideology, we find that the strategy of economic policies differs depending on the leader and political and economic circumstances at the time. In particular, since Kim Jong-un assumed office in 2011, the topics have diversified, and now cover a wide range of subjects on capitalism.

This is especially the case during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aims to elucidate the rules underlying the network public opinion diffusion of COIVD-19 triggered government credibility crisis event and the corresponding countermeasures. A system dynamics model is established to formulate and simulate the interactions of four entities, that is, event per see, the netizens, the media, and the government, involved in the ""Dr. Li Wenliang event""and their joint effects in the crisis evolution, shedding on the priority of influencing factors in different phases. The results indicate that the network public opinion follows the rule of ""latency-outbreak-rise-fade"". The sensitivity and explosiveness of the incident, the intensification of netizens, the public opinion leader effect, and the attention of the media play critical roles in network public opinion diffusion. Media's attention and netizen's intensification are the main influencing factors during the stage of public opinion explosion and waning period, respectively. The degree of government information disclosure and the early warning capability significantly alleviate the network public opinion diffusion. This study offers insight for government management in response to creditability crisis events during a special time. © 2021 ACM.","Cai, Z.; Huang, H.; Ma, D.","2021 5th International Conference on Management Engineering, Software Engineering and Service Sciences, ICMSS 2021",198,27

The first 44 amino acids of this protein were able to specify Golgi retention of a fused marker protein, lysozyme. This section of ST contains a transmembrane segment which serves as a non-cleaved signal anchor. When lysozyme was fused to an equivalent region of a cell surface protein it now appeared on the cell surface. Analysis of chimeras between the two proteins revealed that the transmembrane segment of ST specifies Golgi retention. Furthermore, altering this segment in full-length ST results in the protein accumulating on the cell surface. However, the retaining effect of the transmembrane domain of ST is augmented by the presence of adjacent lumenal and cytoplasmic sequences from ST. If these sequences are spaced apart by a transmembrane domain of the same length as that of ST they too can specify Golgi retention. Thus retention in the Golgi of ST appears to involve recognition of an extended region of the protein within and on both sides of the bilayer.","Munro, S",,198,7

Infection causes progressive damage to the photoreceptors and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), resulting in a disease the authors have termed JHM retinopathy. To determine whether this virus is retinotropic independent of route of inoculation, the authors injected mice with virus by several different routes: into the anterior chamber (AC), onto the cornea, intranasally, or intracerebrally. Inoculation into the AC produced effects similar to those after intravitreal inoculation, although slightly slower in onset. Viral antigen was detected in the anterior portion of the iris on day 3, and by day 6, was also located primarily in the inner nuclear layer, photoreceptors, Müller cells, and RPE. However, by day 10, viral antigens were only detected in a few cells in the ganglion cell layer. Infectious virus was isolated from neural retinas on days 3 and 6, but not on day 10. In contrast, infectious virus could not be isolated from contralateral eyes. After 14 weeks, specific regions of some retinas were atrophied, with most of the retinal layers involved. Inoculation by other routes also resulted in virus-induced disease. Scarification of the cornea with virus, but not application of virus droplets alone, caused pathologic changes in the corneal epithelium and stroma and subtle effects on the ganglion cell and inner plexiform layers. Intracerebral inoculation of virus affected mainly the RPE. Pathologic effects and viral antigens were not detected in eyes from four mice inoculated intranasally. These results show that a murine coronavirus is retinotropic when introduced by several direct routes and one indirect route. Moreover, these studies show that long-lasting retinal disorders ranging in intensity from mild to severe can occur after coronavirus infection.","Robbins, S G; Detrick, B; Hooks, J J",Investigative ophthalmology & visual science,198,30

After 10 serial passages, replication and virulence of SARS-CoV were increased in the respiratory tract of young rats without clinical signs. By contrast, adult rats infected with the passaged virus showed respiratory symptoms and severe pathological lesions in the lung. Levels of inflammatory cytokines in sera and lung tissues were significantly higher in adult F344 rats than in young rats. During in vivo passage of SARS-CoV, a single amino acid substitution was introduced within the binding domain of the viral spike protein recognizing angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is known as a SARS-CoV receptor. The rat-passaged virus more efficiently infected CHO cells expressing rat ACE2 than did the original isolate.

METHODS This study is a retrospective review of the patients operated between 11.03.2020 and 31.05.2020 in a center with a high incidence of COVID-19 infection during the pandemic. The numbers of emergency, elective and oncological surgeries as well as the increasing or decreasing trends of these interventions between March 11 and May 31 of previous years were compared with the corresponding period of 2020 or in other words the pandemic period. RESULTS From March 11 to May 31, 2020 there was a progressive reduction in surgical activity, with only 195 operations: 61(31,28%) on a scheduled basis for tumor pathology, 59(30,25%) for benign pathology and 75(38,46%) for emergency indications. When the surgical trends of previous years are considered, all types of oncological surgeries decreased significantly in pandemic period March 11 to May 31, 2020. CONCLUSION One of the most striking changes in medical care settings during the COVID-19 pandemic was observed in surgical management strategies. The most significant among these were the limitation of elective surgical procedures and the prioritization of emergency or non-delayed oncological operations. One may speculate that the standstill of elective surgeries including the oncological surgeries might have long term impacts on the clinical outcomes of patients as well as the healthcare workers and organizations.

Clinical studies have documented that potentially severe neurological symptoms are associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, thereby suggesting direct CNS penetration by the virus. Prior studies have demonstrated that the destructive neurological effects of rabies virus (RABV) infections are mediated by CNS transport of the virus tightly bound to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR). By comparison, it has been hypothesized that a similar mechanism exists to explain the multiple neurological effects of SARS-CoV-2 via binding to peripheral nAChRs followed by orthograde or retrograde transport into the CNS. Genetic engineering of the RABV has been employed to generate novel vaccines consisting of non-replicating RABV particles expressing chimeric capsid proteins containing human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), Ebolavirus, and hepatitis C virus (HCV) sequences. Accordingly, we present a critical discussion that integrates lessons learned from prior RABV research and vaccine development into a working model of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine that selectively targets and neutralizes CNS penetration of a tightly bound viral nAChR complex.","Stefano, Michelle L; Kream, Richard M; Stefano, George B",Med Sci Monit,198,4

Identification, isolation and caring for patients early are essential to limit human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts and health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events. The RT-PCR detection of viral nucleic acid test (NAT) was one of the most quickly established laboratory diagnosis method in a novel viral pandemic, just as in this COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: 4880 cases that had respiratory infection symptoms or close contact with COVID-19 patients in hospital in Wuhan, China, were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection by use of quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) on samples from the respiratory tract. Positive rates were calculated in groups divided by genders or ages. RESULTS: The positive rate was about 38% for the total 4880 specimens. Male and older population had a significant higher positive rates. However, 57% was positive among the specimens from the Fever Clinics. Binary logistic regression analysis showed that age, not gender, was the risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection in fever clinics.

Previous studies from the 2004 SARS-CoV infection demonstrated that NO may also help to reduce respiratory tract infection by inactivating viruses and inhibiting their replication cycle and is an effective supportive measure for treating infection in patients with pulmonary complications. NO gas inhalation is being suggested as potential therapy for managing severe acute respiratory distress syndrome in COVID-19 patients. In view of COVID-19 pandemic, several clinical trials are underway to examine the effects of NO inhalation on infected patients. Previously published reports on beneficial effects of endogenous NO and NO inhalation therapy were thoroughly searched to assess the potential of NO therapy for treating COVID-19 patients. Present report summarized the therapeutic importance of NO to reverse pulmonary hypertension, restore normal endothelial activity and produce anti-thrombotic effects. In addition to this, NO also reduces viral infection by inhibiting its replication and entry into the host cell.

State-of-the-art optical flow tracking velocimetry and shadowgraphy measurements are employed to quantitatively measure the flow velocity, trajectories and size distribution of droplets produced during a dental scaling process. The droplet sizes are found to vary from 5 µm to 300 µm; these correspond to droplet nuclei that could carry viruses. The droplet velocities also vary between 1.3 m s-1 and 2.6 m s-1. These observations confirm the critical role of aerosols in the transmission of disease during dental procedures, and provide invaluable knowledge for developing protocols and procedures to ensure the safety of both dentists and patients.","Mirbod, Parisa; Haffner, Eileen A; Bagheri, Maryam; Higham, Jonathan E",J R Soc Interface,198,26

Methods: Data from a single center was analyzed retrospectively. Patients had received preliminary standard of intensive care (SIC) according to a local treatment algorithm, either alone or along with Octagam 5% at 30 g/day for 5 days. Both groups were compared regarding baseline characteristics, survival, and changes in inflammation markers. Imbalance in baseline APACHE II scores was addressed by propensity score matching. Otherwise, Kaplan-Meier and multiple logistic regression models were used. Results: Out of 93 patients, 51 had received Octagam and 42 had not. About 75% of patients were male and both groups had comparable body mass index and AB0 blood type distribution. Octagam-treated patients were younger (mean 65 ± 15 versus 71 ± 15 years, p = 0.066) and had slightly lower baseline disease scores (APACHE II: 20.6 versus 22.4, p = 0.281; SOFA: 5.0 versus 7.0, p = 0.006). Overall survival was 61% in the SIC + Octagam and 38% in the SIC only group (odds ratio: 2.2, 95% confidence interval: 0.9-5.4, p = 0.091 after controlling for baseline imbalances). Octagam significantly prolonged median survival time (68 versus 18 days, p = 0.014) and significantly reduced plasma levels of C-reactive protein (median change from baseline -71.5 versus -0.3 mg/L, p = 0.049). Conclusion: Clinically relevant benefits through adjunct Octagam treatment in COVID-19 need to be confirmed in a randomized, controlled trial.","Esen, Figen; Özcan, Perihan E; Orhun, Günseli; Polat, Özlem; Anakli, Ilkay; Alay, Gülçin; Tuna, Verda; Çeliksoy, Emre; Kiliç, Mehmet; Mercan, Mutlu; Tukek, Tufan",Curr Med Res Opin,198,10

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The expression levels of circUBAP2, miR-199a, and VEGFA in tissues and cell lines were detected by RT-qPCR. The cell proliferation was examined by CCK-8 and colony formation assays. The migration and invasion abilities were evaluated by wound healing and transwell assays, respectively. Bioinformatics analysis and Luciferase activity assay were applied to determine the interaction between genes. RESULTS: The expression of circUBAP2 was upregulated in CRC tissues and cell lines, and depletion of circUBAP2 suppressed the cell proliferation, migration, and invasion of CRC. Furthermore, miR-199a inhibitor abrogated the suppressive effect of circUBAP2 knockdown on CRC progression. Vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) was identified as a downstream target gene of miR-199a, and overexpression of VEGFA rescued the tumor phenotypes attenuated by circUBAP2 knockdown or miR-199a overexpression. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrated that circUBAP2 facilitated CRC progression by sponging miR-199a to upregulate VEGFA. These findings implied that circUBAP2 may be a potential therapeutic biomarker for CRC.","Dai, J; Zhuang, Y; Tang, M; Qian, Q; Chen, J-P",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,198,23

This paper provides a review of the evidence that ECE environments benefit Latino children and mitigate the impact of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and other poverty-related risks; however, Latino families face numerous barriers to accessing ECE opportunities for their children. While enrollment by Latino children in ECE programs has grown in prior decades, further increases in access to ECE are needed to benefit Latino children, who are disproportionately impacted by poverty. In addition, ECE programs, especially high-quality and dual generation-focused programs like Early Head Start and Head Start, are in a strong position to help offset the risk for poor educational and mental health outcomes due to Latino's children's exposure to stressors such as discrimination and ACEs. Gaps remain in how well ECE is serving Latino families due to a combination of factors including parental work schedules, heritage language and cultural factors, and the lack of affordable and available ECE programs in Latino communities. To remedy these gaps, researchers must continue to further elucidate the needs, preferences, and gaps regarding access to early care and education opportunities for Latino children. For those studying trauma and ACEs among low-income children, greater attention to how preventative interventions or treatments that are embedded in ECE settings serve Latino populations is warranted, as this has the tremendous potential to mitigate the long-term impact of ACEs on Latino children. The paper concludes with a set of early childhood practice and policy recommendations for enhancing protective experiences for low-income Latino children.","Smith, Julia Mendez",Advers Resil Sci,198,29

With NH residents poor initial vaccine response, the rise of NH breakthrough infections and outbreaks, characterization of the durability of immunity to inform public health policy on the need for boosting is needed. We report on humoral immunity from 2 weeks to 6-months post-vaccination in 120 NH residents and 92 ambulatory healthcare worker controls with and without pre-vaccination SARS-CoV-2 infection. Anti-spike and anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG, and serum neutralization titers, were assessed using a bead-based ELISA method and pseudovirus neutralization assay. Anti-spike, anti-RBD and neutralization levels dropped more than 84% over 6 months time in all groups irrespective of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. At 6 months post-vaccine, 70% of the infection-naive NH residents had neutralization titers at or below the lower limit of detection compared to 16% at 2 weeks after full vaccination. These data demonstrate a significant reduction in levels of antibody in all groups. In particular, those infection-naive NH residents had lower initial post-vaccination humoral immunity immediately and exhibited the greatest declines 6 months later. Healthcare workers, given their younger age and relative good-health, achieved higher initial antibody levels and better maintained them, yet also experienced significant declines in humoral immunity. Based on the rapid spread of the delta variant and reports of vaccine breakthrough in NH and among younger community populations, boosting NH residents may be warranted.","Canaday, David H.; Oyebanji, Oladayo; Keresztesy, Debbie; Payne, Michael; Wilk, Dennis; Caris, Lenore; Aung, Htin; Denis, Kerri St.; Lam, Evan; Rowley, Christopher; Berry, Sarah; Cameron, Cheryl; Cameron, Mark; Wilson, Brigid; Balazs, Alejandro; King, Christopher; Gravenstein, Stefan",,198,16

We investigated spinal entheseal plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) toll-like receptor (TLR)-7 and 9 activation and therapeutic modulation, including JAK inhibition. We also investigated if COVID-19 infection, a potent TLR-7 stimulator triggered PsA flares. Methods: Normal entheseal pDCs were characterized and stimulated with imiquimod and CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) to evaluate TNF and IFN&#945; production. NanoString gene expression assay of total pDCs RNA was performed pre- and post- ODN stimulation. Pharmacological inhibition of induced IFN&#945; protein was performed with Tofacitinib and PDE4 inhibition. The impact of SARS-CoV2 viral infection on PsA flares was evaluated. Results: CD45+HLA-DR+CD123+CD303+CD11c- entheseal pDCs were more numerous than blood pDCs (1.9 ± 0.8% vs 0.2 ± 0.07% of CD45+ cells, p=0.008) and showed inducible IFN&#945; and TNF protein following ODN/imiquimod stimulation and were the sole entheseal IFN&#945; producers. NanoString data identified 11 significantly upregulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) including TNF in stimulated pDCs.

Evidence suggests that severe outcomes in COVID19 infection are attributed to the excessive activation of the complement cascade leading to acute lung injury and associated is with an increased prothrombotic state. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 27-year-old Caucasian man with PNH presented to the Emergency Department of our hospital with acute onset shortness of breath, cough and blood in urine. DIAGNOSIS: The patient was diagnosed with acute hemolytic exacerbation of PNH complicated with moderate COVID19 pneumonia. OUTCOMES: The patient was initiated with an anticoagulant unfractionated heparin, dexamethasone, and cefuroxime injection. His symptoms quickly resolved, and he was discharged after 5 days. CONCLUSION: The complement system activation is a critical component in the sequalae of COVID19 infection. Evidence suggests that severe outcomes in COVID19 infection are attributed to the excessive activation of the complement cascade leading to acute lung injury and associated is with an increased prothrombotic state. Notably, C5a concentration was noted to be higher in patients with COVID19 infection. The use of complement inhibitors to attenuate immune mediated damage in COVID19 nevertheless represents a very interesting theoretical approach. However, careful consideration as to which patients may benefit will be required and the outcome of clinical trials needed.","Sokol, Juraj; Nehaj, Frantisek; Mokan, Michal; Lisa, Lenka; Stasko, Jan",Medicine (Baltimore),198,21

I find that beliefs about conspiracy theories are more correlated than the values associated with established political ideologies, and that conspiracy beliefs and scepticism about the pandemic are best explained by belief in unrelated political and medical conspiracy theories. No other demographic or attitudinal variable has such a strong influence, and the results are robust to different statistical specifications. In comparison, the effect of ideology measured by left-right self-placement is rather negligible and further moderated by trust in government.

The present discussion is to bring the focus on various social issues that emerge during outbreak and calls for equal attention as that of other health-care interventions. These issues are summarized in three categories: first, stigmatization due to lack of knowledge about the source of infection; second, speculations and their consequences around lack of knowledge about transmission; and finally, the concern regarding miscommunication during such a crisis. Most of these concerns emerge from press and social media coverage of the episode. The Ebola outbreak response is an example of how social scientists and anthropologists can work with other experts to solve questions of public health importance. Their approach toward the community with the objective to understand the sources, reasons, and circumstances of the infection will help to manage the current outbreak. In this context, we suggest collaboration of diverse scientific community to control and sensitize the people to tackle the misinformation in the affected and non-affected community during the outbreaks.","Sonekar, Harshal B; Ponnaiah, Manickam",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,198,24

During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic, acupuncture has been used as a complementary treatment for COVID-19 in China. However, the underlying mechanism of acupuncture treatment of COVID-19 remains unclear. Based on bioinformatics/topology, this paper systematically revealed the multi-target mechanisms of acupuncture therapy for COVID-19 through text mining, bioinformatics, network topology, etc. Two active compounds produced after acupuncture and 180 protein targets were identified. A total of 522 Gene Ontology terms related to acupuncture for COVID-19 were identified, and 61 pathways were screened based on the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes. Our findings suggested that acupuncture treatment of COVID-19 was associated with suppression of inflammatory stress, improving immunity and regulating nervous system function, including activation of neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, calcium signaling pathway, cancer pathway, viral carcinogenesis, Staphylococcus aureus infection, etc. The study also found that acupuncture may have additional benefits for COVID-19 patients with cancer, cardiovascular disease and obesity. Our study revealed for the first time the multiple synergistic mechanisms of acupuncture on COVID-19. Acupuncture may play an active role in the treatment of COVID-19 and deserves further promotion and application.

These comprise, aside from normal spin diffusion, three types of superdiffusive transport: the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class and two distinct types of anomalous diffusion with multiplicative logarithmic corrections. Our predictions are supported by extensive numerical simulations on various examples of quantum and classical chains.

The aim of the present study was to estimate whether the CRP level is able to act as a marker in indicating the severity of COVID-19. METHODS: Patients who complained cough or chest pain with or without fever were enrolled after laboratory confirmed of SARS-CoV-2 viral nucleic acid via qRT-PCR. Chest computed tomography (CT) was then performed to classify the patients into mild, moderate and severe pneumonia groups according to the interim management guideline. Then linear regression models were applied to analyze the association between c-reactive protein (CRP) levels and severity of COVID-19 pneumonia. RESULTS: When compared to mild pneumonia, the adjusted-Odds Ratio were 11.46, p = 0.029 and 23.40, p = 0.025 in moderate and severe pneumonia, respectively. The area under receiver operation curve was 0.898 (95% CI 0.835, 0.962, p < 0.001). Higher plasma CRP level indicated severe COVID-19 pneumonia and longer inpatients duration. CONCLUSIONS: The level of plasma CRP was positively correlated to the severity of COVID-19 pneumonia. Our findings could assist to discern patients of moderate to severe COVID-19 pneumonia from the mild ones. Our findings may be useful as an earlier indicator for severe illness and help physicians to stratify patients for intense care unit transfer.","Chen, Wei; Zheng, Kenneth I; Liu, Saiduo; Yan, Zhihan; Xu, Chongyong; Qiao, Zengpei",Ann Clin Microbiol Antimicrob,198,1

In this study we report on the triphasic nature of the relationship between plant water potential (&#968;) at predawn and midday and describe a method that predicts &#968; at stomatal closure and turgor loss exclusively from this water potential (WP) curve. The method is based on a piecewise linear regression model that was developed to predict the boundaries (termed O1 and O2) separating the three phases of the curve and corresponding slope values. The method was tested for three economically important woody species. For all species, midday &#968; was much more negative than predawn &#968; during phase I (mild drought), reductions in midday &#968; were minor while predawn &#968; continued to decline during phase II (moderate drought), and midday and predawn &#968; reached similar values during phase-III (severe drought). Corresponding measurement of leaf gas exchange indicated that boundary O1 between phase I and II coincided with &#968; at stomatal closure. Data from pressure-volume curves demonstrated that boundary O2 between phase II and III predicted &#968; at leaf turgor loss. The WP curve method described here is an advanced application of the Scholander-type pressure chamber to categorize plant dehydration under drought into three distinct phases and to predict &#968;-thresholds of stomatal closure and turgor loss.","Knipfer, Thorsten; Bambach, Nicolas; Hernandez, M Isabel; Bartlett, Megan K; Sinclair, Gabriela; Duong, Fiona; Kluepfel, Daniel A; McElrone, Andrew J",Plant physiol,198,16

A total of 480 breathing sounds (240 shallow and 240 deep) were obtained from a publicly available database named Coswara. These sounds were recorded by 120 COVID-19 and 120 healthy subjects via a smartphone microphone through a website application. A deep learning framework was proposed herein the relies on hand-crafted features extracted from the original recordings and from the mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) as well as deep-activated features learned by a combination of convolutional neural network and bi-directional long short-term memory units (CNN-BiLSTM). Analysis of the normal distribution of the combined MFCC values showed that COVID-19 subjects tended to have a distribution that is skewed more towards the right side of the zero mean (shallow: 0.59{+/-}1.74, deep: 0.65{+/-}4.35).

First, cell cytotoxicity of Renessans on the Vero cells was determined using MTT assay. Afterwards, the antiviral activity of Renessans was determined using viral inhibition assays and TCID50. For this, nontoxic concentrations of the Renessans were used. The results showed that Renessans is nontoxic to the cells up to 50 µg/mL.

Drugs with quinoline scaffolds have been studied to repurpose their useful broad-spectrum properties into treating various diseases, including viruses. Preliminary studies on the quinoline medications, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, against SARS-CoV-2, have shown to be a potential area of interest for drug development due to their ability to prevent viral entry, act as anti-inflammatory modulators, and inhibit key enzymes allowing reduced viral infectivity. In addition to Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine, we discussed analogs of the drugs to understand the quinoline scaffold's potential antiviral mechanisms. The heterocyclic scaffold of quinoline can be modified in many ways, primarily through the modification of its substituents. We studied these different synthetic derivatives to understand properties that could enhance its antiviral specificity thoroughly. Chloroquine and its analogs can act on various stages of the viral life cycle, pre and post entry. In this study, we reviewed chloroquine and its synthetic and natural analogs for their antiviral properties in a variety of viruses. Furthermore, we reviewed the compound's potential abilities to attenuate symptoms associated with viral infections. Natural compounds that share scaffolding to chloroquine can act as antivirals or attenuate symptoms through the stimulation of the host immune system or reduction of oxidative stress.

The SARS-CoV-2 genome and its association to SAR-CoV-1 vary from ca. 66 to 96% depending on the type of betacoronavirideae family members. With several drugs, viz. chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin, artemisinin, remdesivir, azithromycin considered for clinical trials, there has been an inherent need to find distinctive antiviral mechanisms of these drugs. Curcumin, a natural bioactive molecule has been shown to have therapeutic potential for various diseases, and its effect on COVID-19 is also currently being explored. In this study, we show the binding potential of curcumin targeted to a variety of SARS-CoV-2 proteins, viz. spike glycoproteins (PDB ID: 6VYB), nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (PDB ID: 6VYO), spike protein-ACE2 (PDB ID: 6M17) along with nsp10 (PDB ID: 6W4H) and RNA dependent RNA polymerase (PDB ID: 6M71) structures. Furthermore, representative docking complexes were validated using molecular dynamics simulations and mechanistic studies at 100 ns was carried on nucleocapsid and nsp10 proteins with curcumin complexes which resulted in stable and efficient binding energies and correlated with that of docked binding energies of the complexes. Both the docking and simulation studies indicate that curcumin has the potential as an antiviral against COVID-19.","Suravajhala, Renuka Parashar Abhinav Choudhir Gourav Kumar Anuj Malik Babita Nagaraj Viswanathan Arun Govindarajan Padmanaban Polavarapu Rathnagiri Suravajhala Prashanth Kavi Kishor P.

The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in an unprecedented health and economic crisis worldwide. Little is known about the specifics of its influence on people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) (PLWHA). In this study, we aim to investigate the prevalence and mortality in PLWHA co-infected with COVID-19. METHODS: The databases PUBMED, EMBASE, BioRxiv, and medRxiv were searched up to 9 March 2021 to explore the prevalence and mortality rate of COVID-19 in PLWHA. Cohort studies and case series meeting the inclusion criteria were included in this review. RESULTS: We identified 14 eligible studies, 9 of which were cohort and 5 were case series. A total of 203,761 patients with COVID-19 were identified (7718 PLWHA vs. 196,043 non-PLWHA). Meta-analyses estimated the prevalence and mortality rate of COVID-19 in PLWHA was 0.774% [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.00393-0.01517] and 8.814% (95% CI 0.05766-0.13245) respectively. COVID-19 co-infected PLWHA do not seem to be associated with higher mortality, as compared to non-PLWHA [relative risk (RR) 0.96 (95% CI 0.88-1.06)]. The presence of comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus, RR 5.2 (95% CI 4.25-6.36), hypertension and chronic cardiac disease, RR 4.2 (95% CI 1.09-16.10), and chronic kidney disease, RR 8.43 (95% CI 5.49-12.93) were associated with an increased mortality in COVID-19 co-infected PLWHA. CONCLUSION: The estimated prevalence and mortality rate of COVID-19 in PLWHA were 0.774% and 8.814%, respectively. Since most of the included studies used unmatched populations, comparisons between PLWHA and non-PLWHA should be interpreted with caution. Further investigations are needed for a more comprehensive understanding of the relationship between cluster of differentiation 4 cell count, HIV viral load, antiretroviral therapy, and COVID-19 related prognosis in PLWHA.","Liang, Min; Luo, Ning; Chen, Mafeng; Chen, Chunna; Singh, Shivank; Singh, Shantanu; Tan, Shifan",,198,1

However, costs, logistics, and uncertainty about effectiveness are potential barriers to implementation. We assessed early data from the Massachusetts K-12 public school pooled SARS-CoV2 testing program, which incorporates two novel design elements: in-school ""pod pooling"" for assembling pools of dry anterior nasal swabs from 5 to 10 individuals and positive pool deconvolution using the BinaxNOW antigen rapid diagnostic test (Ag RDT), to assess the operational and analytical feasibility of this approach. Over 3 months, 187,597 individual swabs were tested across 39,297 pools from 738 schools. The pool positivity rate was 0.8%; 98.2% of pools tested negative and 0.2% inconclusive, and 0.8% of pools submitted could not be tested. Of 310 positive pools, 70.6% had an N1 or N2 probe cycle threshold (CT) value of &#8804;30. In reflex testing (performed on specimens newly collected from members of the positive pool), 92.5% of fully deconvoluted pools with an N1 or N2 target CT of &#8804;30 identified a positive individual using the BinaxNOW test performed 1 to 3 days later. However, of 124 positive pools with full reflex testing data available for analysis, 32 (25.8%) of BinaxNOW pool deconvolution testing attempts did not identify a positive individual, requiring additional reflex testing. With sufficient staffing support and low pool positivity rates, pooled sample collection and reflex testing were feasible for schools. These early program findings confirm that screening for K-12 students and staff is achievable at scale with a scheme that incorporates in-school pooling, primary testing by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), and Ag RDT reflex/deconvolution testing.","Pollock, Nira R; Berlin, David; Smole, Sandra C; Madoff, Lawrence C; Brown, Catherine; Henderson, Kelsey; Larsen, Elizabeth; Hay, Jeremiah; Gabriel, Stacey; Gawande, Atul A; Lennon, Niall J",J Clin Microbiol,198,16

As the electrons interact with electromagnetic radiations, electronic excitations between different energy levels are analysed in detail using time-dependent density functional theory. Various intermolecular and intermolecular interactions are analysed and reaction sites for attacking electrophiles and nucleophiles identified.

Following a referral for a pleural drain insertion for a pneumothorax in a patient with COVID-19, we reassessed the infection risks involved in this procedure and its aftercare. Pleural drainage tubes attached to an underwater seal drain allow expulsion of aerosol and larger droplets via the vent from the bottle into the surrounding environment, potentially leading to infection of other patients and staff.Consequently, we chose to attach an antiviral filter to the venting port of an underwater seal drain bottle to mitigate this risk. A fluorescein dye experiment was used to demonstrate the reduction in aerosol emission output from the bottle with our described technique, allowing an antiviral filter to be attached to a pleural underwater seal drainage bottle for added protection of patients and staff in the local environment.","Akhtar, Mohammed R; Ricketts, William; Fotheringham, Tim",Clin Med (Lond),198,1

At the onset of the pandemic, many planned medical and surgical visits for skin cancers were postponed. Physicians and patients have had to balance the risk of exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) with that of worsening morbidity and mortality due to delays in skin cancer treatments. We present a male patient who had two melanoma-in-situs (MISs) that were treated during the COVID-19 pandemic with a combination of topical imiquimod 5% cream, 5-fluorouracil 2% solution, and tretinoin 0.1% cream. The successful treatments occurred without in-person visits and with the aid of telemedicine.

Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first reported in Wuhan, China, and then spread all over the world in a short time. OBJECTIVES: To highlight and discuss the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on mental or psychological health. METHOD: Literature search and collection of the information were performed using PubMed, the reports from the World health organization, and the Center for disease control and prevention. RESULTS: COVID-19 infection has already been declared as a global pandemic, which in association with infodemic has increased the risk of psychiatric/psychological disorders. A large population of the world is prone to develop anxiety, depressive disorders, and other mental abnormalities. Therefore, timely psychological interventions and preventive strategies are required. Moreover, the infection has been reported to be linked with cerebrovascular conditions; therefore, patients with underlying cerebrovascular diseases should be given attention. CONCLUSION: COVID-19-mediated mental health complications and cerebrovascular conditions may cause a huge burden on healthcare communities in the future. Therefore, timely intervention and the development or application of preventive strategies are required to decrease the risk of neurological consequences.","Khan, Suliman; Siddique, Rabeea; Xiaoyan, Wang; Zhang, Ruiyi; Nabi, Ghulam; Sohail Afzal, Muhammad; Liu, Jianbo; Xue, Mengzhou",Brain Behav,198,22

Ferrimicrobium acidiphilum is an actinobacterium that respires aerobically on extracellular ferrous ions at pH 1.5. In situ absorbance measurements were conducted on turbid suspensions of intact Fm. acidiphilum using an integrating cavity absorption meter designed for that purpose. Initial velocity kinetic studies monitored the appearance of product ferric ions in the presence of catalytic quantities of cells. Cell-catalyzed iron oxidation obeyed the Michaelis-Menten equation with values for KM and Vmax of 71 µM and 0.29 fmol/min/cell, respectively. Limited-turnover kinetic studies were conducted with higher concentrations of cells to detect and monitor changes in the absorbance properties of cellular redox proteins when the cells were exposed to limited quantities of soluble reduced iron. A single a-type cytochrome with reduced absorbance peaks at 448 and 605 nm was the only redox-active chromophore that was visible as the cells respired aerobically on iron. The reduced cytochrome 605 exhibited mathematical and correlational properties that were consistent with the hypothesis that oxidation of the cytochrome constituted the rate-limiting step in the aerobic respiratory process with a turnover number of 35 ± 2 s-1 Genomic and proteomic analyses showed that Fm. acidiphilum could and did express only two a-type heme copper terminal oxidases. Cytochrome 605 was associated with the terminal oxidase gene that is located between nucleotides 31090 and 33039, inclusive, in the annotated circular genome of this bacterium.IMPORTANCE The identities and functions of proteins involved in aerobic respiration on extracellular ferrous ions at acidic pH are poorly understood in the 4 phyla of Gram-positive eukaryotes and archaea where such activities occur. In situ absorbance measurements were conducted on Fm. acidiphilum as it respired on extracellular iron using an integrating cavity absorption meter that permitted accurate optical measurements in turbid suspensions of the intact bacterium under physiological conditions. The significance of these measurements is that they permitted a direct spectrophotometric examination of the extents and rates of biological electron transfer events in situ under non-invasive physiological conditions without disrupting the complexity of the live cellular environment. One thing is certain: one way to understand how a protein functions in an intact organism is to actually observe that protein as it functions in the intact organism. This paper provides an example of just such an observation.","Blake, Robert C; Guidry, Jessie J; Anthony, Micah D; Ban, Bhupal; Smith, Kayla A; Walton, Noelle N; Painter, Richard G",,198,24

As part of efforts to improve the reliability of forensic evidence, scientific and policy groups increasingly recommend routine and blind proficiency tests of practitioners. What is not known is how doing so affects how lay jurors assess testimony by forensic practitioners in court. In Study 1, we recruited 1398 lay participants, recruited online using Qualtrics to create a sample representative of the U.S. population with respect to age, gender, income, race/ethnicity, and geographic region. Each read a mock criminal trial transcript in which a forensic examiner presented the central evidence. The low-proficiency forensic examiner elicited a lower conviction rate and less favorable impressions than the control, an examiner for which no proficiency information was disclosed. However, the high-proficiency examiner did not correspondingly elicit a higher conviction rate or more favorable impressions than the control. In Study 2, 1420 participants, similarly recruited using Qualtrics, received the same testimony, but for some conditions the examiner was cross-examined by a defense attorney. We find cross-examination significantly reduced guilty votes and examiner ratings for low-proficiency examiners. These results suggest that disclosing results of blind proficiency testing can inform jury decision-making, and further, that defense lawyering can make proficiency information particularly salient at a criminal trial.","Crozier, William E; Kukucka, Jeff; Garrett, Brandon L",Forensic Sci Int,198,20

This study aimed to examine the sleep quality of frontline healthcare workers (FLHCW) in Bahrain during the COVID-19 pandemic, and compare it with the sleep quality of non-frontline healthcare workers (NFLHCW). METHODS: Healthcare workers (n = 280) from multiple facilities belonging to the Ministry of Health, Bahrain, were invited to participate in this cross-sectional study. An online questionnaire, including socio-demographics, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), was used to evaluate sleep disturbances and stress levels of healthcare workers. Poor sleep quality was defined as PSQI &#8805; 5 and moderate-severe stress as PSS &#8805; 14. Descriptive statistics were used to compare the scores of FLHCW and NFLHCW. Univariate and multivariate binary logistic regressions were used to identify predictors of poor sleep quality, moderate-severe stress, and the combined problem of poor sleep quality and moderate-severe stress. RESULTS: A total of 257 participants (129 FLHCW and 128 NFLHCW) provided usable responses. The overall PSQI and PSS scores were 7.0 ± 3.3 and 20.2 ± 7.1, respectively. The FLHCW scored higher in the PSQI and PSS compared with the NFLHCW; however, the differences in the PSQI and PSS scores were not statistically significant. For the FLHCW, 75% were poor sleepers, 85% had moderate-severe stress, and 61% had both poor sleep quality and moderate-severe stress. For the NFLHCW, 76% were poor sleepers, 84% had moderate-severe stress, and 62% had both poor sleep quality and moderate-severe stress.

This study aimed to investigate the association between insomnia, academic performance, self-reported health, physical activity, school start time, and substance use among adolescents. METHODS: A survey with a cross-sectional design was completed by adolescents (15-17 years old; n = 1504) in southern Sweden. The Minimal Insomnia Symptoms Scale (MISS) was used to operationalize insomnia. A multiple logistic regression analysis was used to analyze the relationship between insomnia and self-reported health, failed school courses, substance use, school start time, family financial situation, screen time, and gender. RESULTS: Insomnia (MISS &#8805; 6) was associated with poor self-reported health (OR: 4.35), failed school courses (OR: 1.47), and use of alcohol and/or cigarettes (OR: 1.43). When the combined effect of self-reported health and physical activity were investigated, a combination of low physical activity (&#8804;1 time/week) and poor self-reported health was strongly associated with insomnia (OR: 18.87).

The common format of delivering in-person psychotherapy is replaced by psychotherapy via the Internet to a great extent. This study examined how well Austrian psychotherapists feel informed about the use of the Internet in psychotherapy, where additional information needs exist, and which software is used. A link to an online survey was sent to all psychotherapists providing a valid email address in the official list of licensed psychotherapists at the start of the COVID-19 lockdown in Austria. A total of 1547 people took part in the survey. The results show that psychotherapy via the Internet was primarily offered via Skype and Zoom during the COVID-19 pandemic and that the majority of the therapists felt well-informed about psychotherapy via the Internet; however, several therapists stated that they wish to have further information on data protection and security. Overall, the study shows that Austrian psychotherapists coped well with the rapid change from the provision of psychotherapy through personal contact to psychotherapy via the Internet. Security and data protection aspects of therapy via the Internet should be addressed in training and further education of psychotherapists. As this study was conducted online, it might have caused some respondent bias towards a higher participation of psychotherapists with higher preference for new technologies.","Humer, Elke; Stippl, Peter; Pieh, Christoph; Schimböck, Wolfgang; Probst, Thomas",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),198,1

As both pregnant and paediatric patients are likely to be excluded from most planned investigations, the list of repurposed options and the available data on these drugs and vaccines provide a baseline risk assessment and identify gaps for targeted investigation. METHODS: Clinical trials have been searched and reviewed; 23 repurposed drugs and drug combinations and nine candidate vaccines have been assessed regarding the availability of relevant data in paediatrics and pregnant women and to evaluate expected or unanticipated risk. RESULTS: Thirteen of the repurposed drugs or drug combinations are indicated for use in paediatrics in some age category albeit for indications other than COVID-19; 10 of these are indicated for use in pregnant women. Even in cases where these drugs are indicated in the populations, source data from which safety and or dosing could be extrapolated for use in COVID-19 is sparse. Vaccine trials are ongoing and generally exclude pregnant women; only in a few instances have paediatric subgroups been planned for enrolment. Data from individual case studies and RWD may suggest that subpopulations of both paediatric patients and pregnant women may be more at risk, particularly those in an increased inflammatory state. CONCLUSION: In conjunction with more prospective collaboration, plans are evolving to ensure that we will be better prepared to address similar situations especially in paediatrics and pregnant women where experience is limited and actual practice relies heavily on leveraging data from other populations and indications.","Barrett, Jeffrey S",,198,5

The primary goal is to optimise comfort from physical, psychosocial, and spiritual stressors. COVID-19 has presented unique challenges to the social work role in an inpatient Palliative Care ward. The ward was considered ""high risk"", and therefore, special restrictions were introduced. For patients in the terminal phase, restrictions initially involved the next of kin nominating up to four family members who could only visit two at a time during a designated time period. Those not deemed in the terminal phase could not have visitors. These restrictions caused increased stressors for families already feeling emotional. A communication plan was developed in collaboration with the multidisciplinary team. This involved the patient's next of kin being allocated a worker who called them each morning to provide an update and record any of their queries and concerns. Other strategies involved gathering information about technology devices families and patients owned along with increasing technology resources on the ward. A social work perspective on person-in-environment has helped in understanding and navigating the micro and macro impact that COVID-19 is having in palliative care.

The need for robust governance responses to turbulent problems,18.65044,2.5181396,2020,"BACKGROUND: In December 2019, coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. The disease has rapidly spread from Wuhan to other regions. OBJECTIVES: To describe the clinical manifestations and epidemiological characteristics of patients with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in Hunan Province in 2020. STUDY DESIGN: From January 19 to February 7, 2020, 33 patients with positive in nucleic acid test of pharyngeal swab were retrospectively collected and analyzed. RESULTS: There are 33 COVID-19 patients (16 male, 17 female), and the median age was 46 years. Nineteen patients (48 %) were associated with a family cluster outbreak. Seventeen patients (52 %) had traveled or lived in Hubei Province. These patients are early mild cases, most common symptoms are fever [23 (70 %)] and cough [13 (39 %)]. Most patients' white blood cell counts are normal, while they manifest as significant reduction in lymphocytes [17/28 (61 %)]. The levels of c-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate suggest a typical viral infection. Procalcitonin did not increase and D-dimer increased slightly. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels have elevated in most patients. CT images of these patients showed bilateral multiple plaques or nodular ground-glass opacities (68.4 %). Fecal nucleic acid results were positive in eight COVID-19 patients accompanied with diarrhea. Tear nucleic acid results were negative in six COVID-19 patients. And four asymptomatic patients were infected with SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical symptoms, laboratory results and imaging reports of patients with COVID-19 in Hunan area are significantly different from those in Wuhan area. For non-Wuhan epidemic areas, more attention should be paid to nucleic acid test results of throat swabs and stools, and it is not easily to diagnose based on clinical symptoms and CT results. Reduced whole blood lymph count can be used as an adjuvant diagnosis of early SARS-CoV-2 infection. Attention should be paid to asymptomatic carriers, which is of great significance for the control of the global epidemic.","Yin, Sheng; Peng, Yizhi; Ren, Yaping; Hu, Min; Tang, Lingli; Xiang, Zhongyuan; Li, Xianping; Wang, Min; Wang, Wenlong",J Clin Virol,198,1

METHODS: We performed a disproportionality analysis of the World Health Organization pharmacovigilance database between January 1, 2020, and June 10, 2020. The frequency of COVID-19 reports for all DMARD classes identified was compared with that for all other reports for all other drugs and quoted as the reporting odds ratio (ROR) (95% confidence interval [CI]). RESULTS: Among 980,446 individual case-safety reports voluntarily recorded in the database, 398 identified COVID-19 in DMARD-treated patients with IRDs. There were 177 (44.5%) patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 120 (30.1%) with ankylosing spondylitis (AS), 93 (23.4%) with psoriatic arthritis (PsA), and 8 (2.0%) with juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Most of the cases of COVID-19 occurred in patients taking anti-TNF agents (84.2%), resulting in a significant disproportionality signal (ROR [95% CI]: 8.31 [7.48-9.23]) - particularly in patients with RA, AS or PsA. A significant inverse disproportionality was found for the anti-IL-6 agent tocilizumab (ROR [95% CI]: 0.12 [0.02-0.88]) and JAK inhibitors (ROR [95% CI]: 0.33 [0.19-0.58]) in patients with RA - suggesting that these two drug classes are safer in the context of RA. CONCLUSION: Our results are in line with the literature on a potentially better safety profile for anti-IL-6 agents and JAK inhibitors. The WHO pharmacovigilance data suggest that COVID-19 is significantly more frequent in patients with IRDs treated with TNF inhibitors.","Dernoncourt, Amandine; Schmidt, Jean; Duhaut, Pierre; Liabeuf, Sophie; Gras-Champel, Valérie; Masmoudi, Kamel; Bennis, Youssef; Batteux, Benjamin",Fundam. clin. pharmacol,198,12

Although red meat is a heme-rich environment, L. sakei does not need iron or heme for growth, while possessing a heme-dependent catalase. Iron incorporation into L. sakei from myoglobin and hemoglobin was formerly shown by microscopy and the L. sakei genome reveals the complete equipment for iron and heme transport. Here, we report the characterization of a five-gene cluster (lsa1836-1840) encoding a putative metal iron ABC transporter. Interestingly, this cluster, together with a heme dependent catalase gene, is also conserved in other species from the meat ecosystem. Our bioinformatic analyses revealed that the locus might correspond to a complete machinery of an Energy Coupling Factor (ECF) transport system. We quantified in vitro the intracellular heme in wild-type (WT) and in our &#916;lsa1836-1840 deletion mutant using an intracellular heme sensor and ICP-Mass spectrometry for quantifying incorporated 57Fe heme. We showed that in the WT L. sakei, heme accumulation occurs rapidly and massively in the presence of hemin, while the deletion mutant was impaired in heme uptake; this ability was restored by in trans complementation. Our results establish the main role of the L. sakei Lsa1836-1840 ECF-like system in heme uptake. Therefore, this research outcome sheds new light on other possible functions of ECF-like systems.Importance Lactobacillus sakei is a non-pathogenic bacterial species exhibiting high fitness in heme rich environments such as meat products, although it does not need iron nor heme for growth. Heme capture and utilization capacities are often associated with pathogenic species and are considered as virulence-associated factors in the infected hosts. For these reasons, iron acquisition systems have been deeply studied in such species, while for non-pathogenic bacteria the information is scarce. Genomic data revealed that several putative iron transporters are present in the genome of the lactic acid bacterium L. sakei. In this study, we demonstrate that one of them, is an ECF-like ABC transporter with a functional role in heme transport. Such evidence has not yet been brought for an ECF, therefore our study reveals a new class of heme transport system.","Verplaetse, Emilie; André-Leroux, Gwenaëlle; Duhutrel, Philippe; Coeuret, Gwendoline; Chaillou, Stéphane; Nielsen-Leroux, Christina; Champomier-Vergès, Marie-Christine",,198,16

Although semiconductor/perovskite heterostructure holds great promise for enhancement in absorption, it has remained a serious challenge for synthesizing semiconductor/perovskite heterostructure. In this work, monodispersed Janus heterostructures composed of Cs4PbBr6 decorated with either multiple Ag or single Ag on its surface (named as mAg/Cs4PbBr6 and sAg/Cs4PbBr6) respectively), are successfully prepared. The size of Ag seeds has an important effect on the shape of the products. Small-sized Ag seeds lead to the formation of mAg/Cs4PbBr6 Janus NCs, while relatively large-sized Ag seeds produce sAg/Cs4PbBr6 Janus NCs. It is noted that this work not only provides a novel method for the modification of individual Cs4PbBr6 NCs, but also enhances the absorption of the Cs4PbBr6 in the visible region, indicating great potential for optoelectronic applications, such as photocatalysis and solar cells.","Su, Sijing; Shen, Jialin; Sun, Haochen; Tao, Jiaqi; Xu, Da; Wei, Tong; Fan, Chao; Wang, Ziying; Sun, Chun; Bi, Wengang",,198,16

Metabolic changes in immune cells have a crucial role in their inflammatory or regulatory responses. This notion is reinforced by metabolic diseases influencing global energy metabolism, such as diabetes or obesity, which are known risk factors of severity in inflammatory conditions, due to the metabolic-associated inflammation present in these patients. Since several metabolic pathways are closely tied to T cell and macrophage differentiation, a better understanding of metabolic alterations in immune disorders could help to restore and modulate immune cell functions. This link between energy metabolism and inflammation can be studied employing animal, human or cellular models. Analytical approaches rank from classic immunological studies to integrated analysis of metabolomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics. This review summarizes the main metabolic pathways of the cells involved in the allergic reaction with a focus on T cells and macrophages and describes different models and platforms of analysis used to study the immune system and its relationship with metabolism.","Rodriguez-Coira, Juan; Villaseñor, Alma; Izquierdo, Elena; Huang, Mengting; Barker-Tejeda, Tomás Clive; Radzikowska, Urszula; Sokolowska, Milena; Barber, Domingo",Front Immunol,198,24

While vaccine candidates and therapeutics are currently undergoing clinical trials, there is a lack of proven effective treatments or cures for COVID-19. In this study, we have presented a synergistic computational platform, including molecular dynamics simulations and immunoinformatics techniques, to rationally design a multi-epitope vaccine candidate for COVID-19. This platform combines epitopes across Linear B Lymphocytes (LBL), Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes (CTL) and Helper T Lymphocytes (HTL) derived from both mutant and wild-type spike glycoproteins from SARS-CoV-2 with diverse protein conformations. In addition, this vaccine construct also takes the considerable glycan shield of the spike glycoprotein into account, which protects it from immune response. We have identified a vaccine candidate (a 35.9 kDa protein), named COVCCF, which is composed of 5 LBL, 6 HTL, and 6 CTL epitopes from the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2. Using multi-dose immune simulations, COVCCF induces elevated levels of immunoglobulin activity (IgM, IgG1, IgG2), and induces strong responses from B lymphocytes, CD4 T-helper lymphocytes, and CD8 T-cytotoxic lymphocytes. COVCCF induces cytokines important to innate immunity, including IFN-Î³, IL4, and IL10. Additionally, COVCCF has ideal pharmacokinetic properties and low immune-related toxicities. In summary, this study provides a powerful, computational vaccine design platform for rapid development of vaccine candidates (including COVCCF) for effective prevention of COVID-19.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), can spread rapidly within congregate residential settings (2-4), including psychiatric facilities. On April 13, 2020, two patients were transferred to Wyoming's state psychiatric hospital from a private psychiatric hospital that had confirmed COVID-19 cases among its residents and staff members (5). Although both patients were asymptomatic at the time of transfer and one had a negative test result for SARS-CoV-2 at the originating facility, they were both isolated and received testing upon arrival at the state facility. On April 16, 2020, the test results indicated that both patients had SARS-CoV-2 infection. In response, the state hospital implemented expanded COVID-19 infection prevention and control (IPC) procedures (e.g., enhanced screening, testing, and management of new patient admissions) and adapted some standard IPC measures to facilitate implementation within the psychiatric patient population (e.g., use of modified face coverings). To assess the likely effectiveness of these procedures and determine SARS-CoV-2 infection prevalence among patients and health care personnel (HCP) (6) at the state hospital, a point prevalence survey was conducted. On May 1, 2020, 18 days after the patients' arrival, 46 (61%) of 76 patients and 171 (61%) of 282 HCP had nasopharyngeal swabs collected and tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. All patients and HCP who received testing had negative test results, suggesting that the hospital's expanded IPC strategies might have been effective in preventing the introduction and spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection within the facility. In congregate residential settings, prompt identification of COVID-19 cases and application of strong IPC procedures are critical to ensuring the protection of other patients and staff members. Although standard guidance exists for other congregate facilities (7) and for HCP in general (8), modifications and nonstandard solutions might be needed to account for the specific needs of psychiatric facilities, their patients, and staff members.","Callaghan, Anna W; Chard, Anna N; Arnold, Patricia; Loveland, Cody; Hull, Noah; Saraiya, Mona; Saydah, Sharon; Dumont, Wendy; Frakes, Laura G; Johnson, Daniel; Peltier, ReaAnna; Van Houten, Clayton; Trujillo, A Angelica; Moore, Jazmyn; Rose, Dale A; Honein, Margaret A; Carrington, David; Harrist, Alexia; Hills, Susan L",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,198,20

FDA-approved anti-parasite drug ivermectin is also an antibacterial, antiviral, and anticancer agent, which offers more potentiality to improve global public health, and it can effectively inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. This study sought to identify ivermectin-related virus infection pathway alterations in human ovarian cancer cells. Stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) quantitative proteomics was used to analyze human ovarian cancer cells TOV-21G treated with and without ivermectin (20 µmol/L) for 24 h, which identified 4447 ivermectin-related proteins in ovarian cancer cells. Pathway network analysis revealed four statistically significant antiviral pathways, including HCMV, HPV, EBV, and HIV1 infection pathways. Interestingly, compared with the reported 284 SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19-related genes from GencLip3, we identified 52 SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19-related protein alterations when treated with and without ivermectin. Protein-protein network (PPI) was constructed based on the interactions between 284 SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19-related genes and between 52 SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19-related proteins regulated by ivermectin. Molecular complex detection analysis of PPI network identified three hub modules, including cytokines and growth factor family, MAP kinase and G-protein family, and HLA class proteins. Gene Ontology analysis revealed 10 statistically significant cellular components, 13 molecular functions, and 11 biological processes.

As health care providers we must be aware of the facts of COVID-19, cultural implications, and potential for stigmatization of populations affected by COVID-2019. It is important to consider the real economic impact related to lost workdays due to quarantine and social isolation efforts as well as travel restrictions that may negatively impact access to care and ability to pay for care. Efforts geared towards general education about the disease and the rationale for quarantine and public health information provided to the general public can reduce stigmatization. Countries who are successful at aggressive screening, early identification, patient isolation, contact tracing, quarantine, and infection control methods should also address the risk of stigmatization among populations and the negative effects which could occur. The cases of COVID-19 will continue to rise and the virus will be sustainable for future infections.

MethodsWe conducted a cohort study on laboratory-confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 in Norway, diagnosed between 3 May and 15 August 2021. We calculated adjusted risk ratios (aRR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using multivariable binomial regression, accounting for variant, vaccination status, demographic characteristics, week of sampling and underlying comorbidities. ResultsWe included 7,977 cases of Delta and 12,078 cases of Alpha. Overall, 347 (1.7%) cases were hospitalised. The aRR of hospitalisation for Delta compared to Alpha was 0.97 (95%CI 0.76-1.23). Partially vaccinated cases had a 72% reduced risk of hospitalisation (95%CI 59%-82%), and fully vaccinated cases had a 76% reduced risk (95%CI 61%-85%), compared to unvaccinated cases. ConclusionsWe found no difference in the risk of hospitalisation for Delta cases compared to Alpha cases in Norway.

METHODS: A 15-question survey was sent out to the American Rhinologic Society's (ARS) membership to determine the impact of COVID-19 during the crisis. Demographic factors and practice patterns were collected and evaluated. RESULTS: There were 224 total respondents out of 835 ARS members queried (26.8% response rate). Study queries were sent in April 2020. Notably, 17.8% reported illness in themselves or their staff and 74.4% noted a psychological/emotional impact. A plurality of rhinologists noted their practice volume and in-office procedure volume has become 20.0% and 0.0% of their prior volumes, respectively. In addition, 96.2% were noted to be using telemedicine in our subspecialty. CONCLUSION: In addition to severely impacting volume and the perception of future decreases in patients and revenue, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a physical and emotional impact on rhinologists in ways that need to be further studied. These data include significantly novel and objective information. The COVID-19 crisis also reveals the important role of telemedicine in rhinology. Guidelines regarding personal protective equipment for in-office visits, nasal endoscopy, and other in-office and operating room procedures would be particularly helpful as future waves are expected.","Setzen, Michael; Svider, Peter F; Setzen, Sean; Setzen, Gavin; Eloy, Jean Anderson; Johnson, Andrew P",Am J Otolaryngol,198,1

For that, the existing medical features like CT and X-ray images are used. For example, CT-scan images can be used for the detection of lung infection. But the challenges of these features such as the quality of the image and infection characteristics limitate the effectiveness of these features. Using artificial intelligence (AI) tools and computer vision algorithms, the accuracy of detection can be more accurate and can help to overcome these issues. This paper proposes a multi-task deep-learning-based method for lung infection segmentation using CT-scan images. Our proposed method starts by segmenting the lung regions that can be infected. Then, segmenting the infections in these regions. Also, to perform a multi-class segmentation the proposed model is trained using the two-stream inputs. The multi-task learning used in this paper allows us to overcome shortage of labeled data. Also, the multi-input stream allows the model to do the learning on many features that can improve the results. To evaluate the proposed method, many features have been used. Also, from the experiments, the proposed method can segment lung infections with a high degree performance even with shortage of data and labeled images. In addition, comparing with the state-of-the-art method our method achieves good performance results.","Elharrouss, Omar; Subramanian, Nandhini; Al-Maadeed, Somaya",,198,16

Well-ordered periodic surface ripple/finger patterns were observed during the adhesion and coalescence, which eventually disappeared, leaving smooth polymer-air interfaces. The life-times of these transient well-ordered patterns depend on the viscosity and film thickness of the polymer melts. These observations are in contrast to the conventional understanding that liquid-liquid coalescence usually occurs with the deforming surfaces remaining smoothly curved at all stages, with no esoteric shape-transitions. The results reveal a new feature associated with liquid-liquid adhesion/coalescence, which may be of key importance for a full understanding of coalescence processes.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Measurement of modulation transfer function (MTF) and acquisition of a line pairs phantom were performed. An anthropomorphic lung nodule phantom was scanned with standard (120kVp, 62mAs), low (120kVp, 11mAs), and ultra-low (80kVp, 3mAs) radiation doses. A human volunteer underwent standard (120kVp, 63mAs) and low (120kVp, 11mAs) dose scans after approval by the ethics committee. HR images were reconstructed with 1024 matrix, 300mm field of view and 0.25mm slice thickness using a filtered-back projection (FBP) and two levels of iterative reconstruction (iDose 5 and 9). The conspicuity and sharpness of various lung structures (distal airways, vessels, fissures and proximal bronchial wall), image noise, and overall image quality were independently analyzed by three radiologists and compared to a previous HR lung CT examination of the same volunteer performed with a conventional CT equipped with energy integrating detectors (120kVp, 10mAs, FBP). RESULTS: Ten percent MTF was measured at 22.3lp/cm with a cut-off at 31lp/cm. Up to 28lp/cm were depicted. While mixed and solid nodules were easily depicted on standard and low-dose phantom images, higher iDose levels and slice thicknesses (1mm) were needed to visualize ground-glass components on ultra-low-dose images. Standard dose SPCCT images of in vivo lung structures were of greater conspicuity and sharpness, with greater overall image quality, and similar image noise (despite a flux reduction of 23%) to conventional CT images. Low-dose SPCCT images were of greater or similar conspicuity and sharpness, similar overall image quality, and lower but acceptable image noise (despite a flux reduction of 89%). CONCLUSIONS: A large field-of-view SPCCT prototype demonstrates HR technical capabilities and high image quality for high resolution lung CT in human.","Si-Mohamed, Salim; Boccalini, Sara; Rodesch, Pierre-Antoine; Dessouky, Riham; Lahoud, Elias; Broussaud, Thomas; Sigovan, Monica; Gamondes, Delphine; Coulon, Philippe; Yagil, Yoad; Boussel, Loïc; Douek, Philippe",Diagn Interv Imaging,198,16

However, despite the diversity of novel theoretical approaches and the comprehensiveness of many widely established models, the official figures that recount the course of the outbreak still sketch a largely elusive and intimidating picture. Here we show unambiguously that the dynamics of the COVID-19 outbreak belongs to the simple universality class of the SIR model and extensions thereof. Our analysis naturally leads us to establish that there exists a fundamental limitation to any theoretical approach, namely the unpredictable non-stationarity of the testing frames behind the reported figures. However, we show how such bias can be quantified self-consistently and employed to mine useful and accurate information from the data. In particular, we describe how the time evolution of the reporting rates controls the occurrence of the apparent epidemic peak, which typically follows the true one in countries that were not vigorous enough in their testing at the onset of the outbreak. The importance of testing early and resolutely appears as a natural corollary of our analysis, as countries that tested massively at the start clearly had their true peak earlier and less deaths overall.","Carletti, Timoteo; Fanelli, Duccio; Piazza, Francesco",,198,10

Using a cross-sectional survey, the current paper aimed to examine self-reported changes in eating patterns and behaviour during the lockdown in the UK, and associations with BMI, demographic variables, eating styles, health anxiety, food insecurity and coping strategies. Participants (N = 620) were recruited online through social media advertising. The results showed that there were self-reported changes to food consumption during the lockdown across the sample. Increases in consumption of HED (high energy density) snack foods during the lockdown was associated with sex, pre-lockdown eating behaviour (emotional eating and uncontrolled eating), and Covid-specific health anxiety. Increases in positive eating practices such as eating more home prepared foods, and fruits and vegetables, were associated with adaptive coping strategies. Higher emotional eating (EE) during the lockdown was associated with a higher BMI, higher pre-lockdown EE and maladaptive coping strategies. Maladaptive coping strategies moderated the relationship between BMI and EE during the lockdown. In particular a higher BMI was associated with higher EE during the lockdown if an individual also had higher maladaptive coping strategies. These findings suggest that changes to eating behaviour may be part of a wider style of maladaptive or adaptive coping, particularly in those with a history of EE or uncontrolled eating. Preparing individuals to adopt more adaptive coping strategies during lockdown situations may be crucial to improving health during subsequent the lockdown events.","Coulthard, Helen; Sharps, Maxine; Cunliffe, Louise; van den Tol, Annemieke",Appetite,198,12

Type I and III interferons (IFNs) are innate cytokines that are important in the first-line defense against viruses. Similar to many other viruses, SARS-CoV-2 has evolved mechanisms for evading the antiviral effects of type I and III IFNs at multiple levels, including the induction of IFN expression and cellular responses to IFNs. In this review, we describe the innate sensing mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 and the mechanisms used by SARS-CoV-2 to evade type I and III IFN responses. We also discuss contradictory reports regarding impaired and robust type I IFN responses in patients with severe COVID-19. Finally, we discuss how delayed but exaggerated type I IFN responses can exacerbate inflammation and contribute to the severe progression of COVID-19.","Kim, You-Me; Shin, Eui-Cheol",Exp Mol Med,198,8

He was named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). This virus is responsible for Covid-19, the name given to the disease associated with it. It spreads worldwide, infecting more than a million people and killing more than 70 miles. The rapid and accurate diagnosis of suspected Covid-19 cases plays a crucial role in medical treatment and timely quarantine. Materials and Methods: In order to counter the Covid-19 pandemic, we have developed a method for the automatic detection of Covid -19, from 2D computed tomography (CT) chest images. It is a supervised software system based on the ANN (Artificial Neural Network) algorithm. Pulmonary CT images were collected from multiple international datasets, with a total of 395 images: 70% were used for training and 30% were used for testing. For each patient, the lungs were segmented using simple thresholding. Then, the segmented lungs were fed into a neural network to predict the probability of SARS-CoV-2 infectious. Results: The internal validation achieved a total accuracy of 97.5% with a specificity of 96.6 % and a 100 % sensitivity. Conclusion: These results demonstrate the proof-ofprinciple for using artificial intelligence to extract radiological features for timely and accurate Covid-19 diagnosis.","Romdhane, H.; Dziri, H.; Ali Cherni, M.; Ben-Sellem, D.",International Journal of Radiation Research,198,16

Accordingly, the present research seeks to understand what types of leadership employees think is most important for supervisors to exhibit when managing these crisis-related contexts and, in light of assertions that women may be better leaders during times of crisis, examines gender differences in how male and female supervisors act and how subordinates perceive and evaluate them in real (Study 1) and hypothetical (Study 2) settings. Results indicate that communal leader behaviors were more important to employees in all three crisis contexts. In Study 1, communality was a stronger predictor than agency of supervisor likability and competence. In Study 2, communality was also more positively related to likability, but agency and communality were equally predictive of competence ratings. Ratings of real supervisors suggest that women were not more communal than men when managing these crises, nor did perceptions of leader behavior differ by supervisor gender in a controlled experiment. However, evaluations of women's competence were more directly related to their display of communal behaviors than were evaluations of male supervisors. This research is helpful practically in understanding effective supervisory leadership during the COVID-19 crisis and contributes to the literature on gender and leadership in crisis contexts by attempting to disentangle gender differences in leader behaviors, perceptions, and evaluations.","Eichenauer, Connor J.; Ryan, Ann Marie Alanis Jo M.",Journal of Leadership &amp; Organizational Studies,198,16

Clarithromycin (CLX) is used in the treatment of peptic ulcer owing to its antibacterial effect. Whether CLX has effects on other gastrointestinal parameters that reduce peptic ulcer has not been previously investigated. Therefore the effects of CLX on gastric acid secretion, mucus secretion and gastric ulcer scores in rats were investigated. A total of 30 albino wistar rats were used for the study. Out of this number, 10 rats each were used for gastric acid secretion, mucus secretion and ulcer scores respectively. In each of these sub groups, 5 rats served as test and were treated with CLX orally and 5 rats served as control. Standard methods were used for the estimation of these parameters of gastric function. The results showed that basal gastric acid, peak acid output following histamine stimulation and mucus secretion were significantly increased (p<0.001) in CLX-treated (test) rats than in their control. Furthermore, ulcer scores were significantly reduced (p<0.001) in the CLX-treated rats than control. In conclusion, Clarithromycin administration reduced gastric ulcers in rats. This may be attributable to not only its antibiotic property but also its ability to increase gastric mucus which counteracts the aggressive effect of the acid.","Ezomike, N E; Ezomike, U O; Osim, Eme E",Niger J Physiol Sci,198,16

Design/Methodology/Approach: The methodology was based on the methods of analysis and logical construction, the basics of descriptive statistics (to determine the phenomenon of debt), as well as the basic approach typical of the heuristic method. Findings: Despite the development of methods of assessing the financial condition, practice very often confirms that the primary direction of assessing the financial condition is the ability to absorb debt. This approach forces a search for an answer to the question, can the individual debt ratio (IWZ) be a measure that answers the question about the financial condition of local government units? Practical Implications: The IDR applied in Poland seems to be an effective instrument for controlling the debt of local government units. The structure of this indicator allows, on the one hand, systemic control of the debt of the entire public finance sector, and, on the other hand, it is flexibly adapted to the specificity and level of affluence of a given entity. Therefore, it is worth promoting such solutions in individual European Union countries as an effective tool for limiting LGU's uncontrolled debt. Originality/Value: Results of the study reflect that IDR concerns the possibility of debt service, but it cannot be a measure of financial condition, because in local government units there are liabilities not only classified as debt obligations. The omission of these obligations and their impact on the financial condition makes the information value of IDR imperfect and incomplete. It is difficult to indicate the optimal solution that would fully reflect the current financial condition. It is possible as well as from the point of view of additional workloads, difficult to implement in practice.","Wołowiec, Tomasz Skrzypek-Ahmed Sylwia Gliszczyński Grzegorz",European Research Studies,198,26

At the same time, the issue of the quarantine imposed changes to the normal lifestyle of these patients. The purpose of our study is to evaluate how the presence of these two factors affect the quality of live of patients living in the Italian red zone. METHODS: From outpatient pre-operative assessment we collect data about: demographic data, WOMAC score, NRS (Numeric rating scale 0-10), PCS SF12 and MCS SF12 score. Selected patients were therefore contacted by telephone call and re-assess using the same score. In addition, patients were asked if they intended to undergo the planned surgery again despite the current emergency Results: 14 patient have been recruited for the study. Male/female ration was 10/4, mean age was 70 years. Pre operative outpatient assessment mean WOMAC score was 44,86 (SD ± 8,52) , mean NRS was 8,07 (SD ± 1,33), PCS SF12 was 30,33 (SD ± 5,0) and MCS SF12 was 40,95 (SD ± 3,51).

Methods: This quantitative research was undertaken by means of an online survey instrument, with questions on participants' behaviour towards COVID-19 and their belief with respect to susceptibility, barriers, benefits, cues to actions and self-efficacy. Results: In total, 405 participants completed the survey. Participants had a low mean COVID-19 perceived susceptibility and perceived severity. Significant differences in susceptibility were observed among different age groups, places of residence and educational levels. A significant difference in self-efficacy was found between people living in urban and rural areas. Participants aged <39 years showed a significantly lower perceived benefit of staying at home to avoid COVID-19 infection compared with those aged 39-54 years. Multiple linear regression modelling revealed that participants aged 39-65 years and those who were single were the most concerned about the risk of COVID-19 infection. Conclusions: The findings of this study provide the basis for evidence-based health education programmes that are tailor-made for specific targeted audience. Sensitisation campaigns on the benefits of staying home should be aimed at younger social media users (aged <39 years).

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to explore the effects of miR-188-5p on cell proliferation and apoptosis and tumor growth, and its mechanism in pediatric APL patients. Materials and Methods: Survival-associated miRNAs or mRNAs from TCGA database associated with AML were identified via using the ""survival R"" package in R language. CCK8, clone formation, flow cytometry, RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry and Western blot assays were used to detect the viability, proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle, and related gene expression in APL cell lines. The prognostic value of miR-188-5p was evaluated using a ROC curve. The tumorigenic ability of APL cell lines was determined using a nude mouse transplantation tumor experiment. Tumor cell apoptosis was determined by TUNEL assay in vivo. The target genes of miR-188-5p were predicted using the miRDB, miRTarBase, and TargetScan databases. A PPI network was constructed using STRING database and the hub gene was identified using the MCODE plug-in of the Cytoscape software. The DAVID database was used to perform GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses. A luciferase reporter assay was used to demonstrate the binding of miR-188-5p to CD2AP. Results: miR-188-5p overexpression or CD2 associated protein (CD2AP) inhibition was significantly associated with poor survival in pediatric APL patients. Upregulation of miR-188-5p was identified in the blood of pediatric APL patients and cell lines. Increased expression of miR-188-5p also promoted the viability, proliferation, and cell cycle progression, and reduced the apoptosis of APL cells. Additionally, upregulation of miR-188-5p regulated the expressions of cyclinD1, p53, Bax, Bcl-2 and cleaved caspase-3. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) of miR-188-5p was 0.661. miR-188-5p overexpression increased the tumorigenic ability of APL and Ki67 expression, and reduced cell apoptosis in vivo. CD2AP was identified as the only overlapping gene from the list of miR-188-5p target genes and survival-related mRNAs of the TCGA database. It was mainly enriched in the ""biological process (BP)"" and ""cellular component (CC)"" terms, and was downregulated in the blood of pediatric APL patients and cell lines. The luciferase reporter, RT-PCR, and Western blot assays demonstrated that the binding of miR-188-5p to CD2AP. CD2AP inhibition promoted the proliferation and inhibited the apoptosis of APL cells. Rescue experiments showed that inhibition of miR-188-5p inhibited cell proliferation, activated the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, induced G0/G1 phase arrest, regulated gene expression, and promoted cell apoptosis, which were reversed by CD2AP inhibition. Conclusion: miR-188-5p, an oncogene, promoted tumor growth and progression of pediatric APL in vitro and in vivo via targeting CD2AP and activating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.","Wang, Dao; Chen, Jiao; Ding, Yanjie; Kong, Huimin; You, Hongliang; Zhao, Yanting; Wei, Huixia; Liu, Yufeng",Onco Targets Ther,198,1

Spain's health care system has been exposed to uncontrollable numbers of patients over a short period, causing the system to collapse. Given that diagnosis is not immediate, and there is no effective treatment for COVID-19, other tools have had to be developed to identify patients at the risk of severe disease complications and thus optimize material and human resources in health care. There are no tools to identify patients who have a worse prognosis than others. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to process a sample of electronic health records of patients with COVID-19 in order to develop a machine learning model to predict the severity of infection and mortality from among clinical laboratory parameters. Early patient classification can help optimize material and human resources, and analysis of the most important features of the model could provide more detailed insights into the disease. METHODS: After an initial performance evaluation based on a comparison with several other well-known methods, the extreme gradient boosting algorithm was selected as the predictive method for this study.

Spain's health care system has been exposed to uncontrollable numbers of patients over a short period, causing the system to collapse. Given that diagnosis is not immediate, and there is no effective treatment for COVID-19, other tools have had to be developed to identify patients at the risk of severe disease complications and thus optimize material and human resources in health care. There are no tools to identify patients who have a worse prognosis than others. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to process a sample of electronic health records of patients with COVID-19 in order to develop a machine learning model to predict the severity of infection and mortality from among clinical laboratory parameters. Early patient classification can help optimize material and human resources, and analysis of the most important features of the model could provide more detailed insights into the disease. METHODS: After an initial performance evaluation based on a comparison with several other well-known methods, the extreme gradient boosting algorithm was selected as the predictive method for this study. In addition, Shapley Additive Explanations was used to analyze the importance of the features of the resulting model. RESULTS: After data preprocessing, 1823 confirmed patients with COVID-19 and 32 predictor features were selected. On bootstrap validation, the extreme gradient boosting classifier yielded a value of 0.97 (95% CI 0.96-0.98) for the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve, 0.86 (95% CI 0.80-0.91) for the area under the precision-recall curve, 0.94 (95% CI 0.92-0.95) for accuracy, 0.77 (95% CI 0.72-0.83) for the F-score, 0.93 (95% CI 0.89-0.98) for sensitivity, and 0.91 (95% CI 0.86-0.96) for specificity.

In this study, we combined recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), as a means of isothermal DNA amplification, with an rkDNA-graphene oxide (GO) probe system to allow the rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 with high sensitivity and selectivity. We used in situ enzymatic synthesis to prepare an rkDNA probe that was complementary to an RPA-amplified sequence of the target N-gene of SARS-CoV-2. The fluorescence of this rkDNA was perfectly quenched in the presence of GO. When the quenched rkDNA-GO system was added to the RPA-amplified sequence of the target SARS-CoV-2, the fluorescence recovered dramatically. The combined RPA/rkDNA-GO system exhibited extremely high selectivity (discrimination factor: 17.2) and sensitivity (LOD = 6.0 aM) for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. The total processing time was only 1.6 h. This combined RPA/rkDNA-GO system appears to be a very efficient and simple method for the point-of-care detection of SARS-CoV-2.","Choi, Moon Hyeok; Lee, Jaehyeon; Seo, Young Jun",Anal Chim Acta,198,23

Our objective was to describe outcomes of COVID-19 patients suffering IHCA at a rural hospital in Southern California. METHODS: Single-center retrospective observational study. A hospital registry of COVID-19 patients was queried for all patients who suffered IHCA and received cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) between May 1st and July 31st, 2020. A manual chart review was performed to obtain patient demographics, oxygen requirement prior to cardiac arrest (CA), details of the resuscitation including presence of an emergency physician, and final disposition. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients were identified, most of whom were Hispanic, male, and aged 50-70. The most common medical comorbidities were diabetes and hypertension. Most patients suffered respiratory arrest, with an initial rhythm of pulseless electrical activity or asystole. Return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) was achieved in 3/9 patients already receiving mechanical ventilation, but all 3 expired within the following 24 h. ROSC was achieved in 10/12 patients not already intubated, though most also expired within a few days. The only 2 patients who survived to discharge suffered respiratory arrest after their oxygen delivery device dislodged. CONCLUSION: At a small rural hospital with limited resources and a predominantly Hispanic population, cardiac arrest in a COVID-19 patient portends an extremely poor prognosis. A better appreciation of these outcomes should help inform emergency providers and patients when discussing code status and attempts at resuscitation, particularly in resource limited settings.","Nene, Rahul V; Amidon, Nicole; Tomaszewski, Christian A; Wardi, Gabriel; Lafree, Andrew",Am J Emerg Med,198,1

This article aims to support shared decision-making process for infant feeding and care with parents and health care providers during the unprecedented times of the pandemic. It proposes a structure and rationale to guide the process that includes (1) discussing with parents evidence-based information and the different options to feed and care for an infant and young child in the context of the pandemic as well as their potential benefits, risks and scientific uncertainties; (2) helping parents to recognize the sensitive nature of the decisions and to clarify the value they place on the different options to feed and care for their infant or young child; and (3) providing guidance and support needed to make and implement their decisions. A shared decision-making process will help parents navigate complex feeding and care decisions for their child as we face the different stages of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Haiek, Laura N; LeDrew, Michelle; Charette, Christiane; Bartick, Melissa",Matern Child Nutr,198,16

To determine the diagnostic accuracy of self-collected snorted and spit saliva in detecting COVID-19 using RT-PCR (ssRT-PCR) and lateral flow antigen test (ssLFA) versus nasopharyngeal swab RT-PCR (npRT-PCR). Methods. One hundred ninety-seven symptomatic subjects for COVID-19 testing in a tertiary hospital underwent snort-spit saliva self-collection for RT-PCR and antigen testing and nasopharyngeal swab for RT-PCR as reference. Positivity rates, agreement, sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios were estimated. Results. Estimated prevalence of COVID-19 using npRT-PCR was 9% (exact 95% CI of 5.5% - 14.1%). A higher positivity rate of 13% in the ssRT-PCR assay suggested possible higher viral RNA in the snort-spit samples. There was 92.9% agreement between ssRT-PCR and npRT-PCR (exact 95% CI of 88.4% to 96.1%;Cohen’s Kappa of 0.6435). If npRT-PCR will be assumed as reference standard, the estimated Sensitivity was 83.3% (exact 95% CI of 60.8% to 94.2%), Specificity 93.9% (exact 95% CI of 89.3% to 96.5%), Positive predictive value of 57.7% (exact 95% CI of 38.9% to 74.5%), Negative predictive value of 98.2% (exact 95% CI of 95% to 99.4%), positive likelihood ratio of 3.65 (95% CI of 7.37 to 24.9), negative likelihood ratio of 0.178 (95% CI of 0.063 to 0.499). There was 84.84% agreement (95% exact CI of 79.1% to 89.5%;Cohen’s Kappa of 0.2356) between ssLFAvs npRT-PCR, sensitivity of 38.9% (exact 95% CI of 20.3% to 61.4%), specificity of 89.4% (exact 95% CI of 84.1% to 93.1%), PPV of 26.9% (95% CI of 13.7% to 46.1%), NPV of 93.6% (exact 95% CI of 88.8% to 96.4%), LR+ of 3.67 (95% CI of 1.79 - 7.51), LR – of 0.68 (95% CI of 0.47 - 0.99). Conclusion. Our data showed that snort-spit saliva RT-PCR testing had acceptable diagnostic performance characteristics and can potentially be used as an alternative to the standard nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swab RT-PCR test for COVID-19 in certain situations. However, our data also showed that snort-spit saliva antigen testing using lateral flow assay did not offer acceptable performance. © 2021 University of the Philippines Manila.

The principal paradox of COVID-19 pneumonia is the presence of severe hypoxemia with preserved pulmonary mechanics. Data derived from the experience of multiple centers around the world have demonstrated that initial clinical efforts should be focused into avoid intubation and mechanical ventilation in hypoxemic COVID-19 patients. On the other hand, COVID-19 patients progressing or presenting into frank ARDS with typical decreased pulmonary compliance, represents another clinical enigma to many clinicians, since routine therapeutic interventions for ARDS are still a subject of debate.","Navas-Blanco, Jose R; Dudaryk, Roman",BMC Anesthesiol,198,26

The PROMISE-EPI study aims to address the latter by identifying HIV infected mothers during an almost never-missed visit for their infant, the second extended program on immunization visit at 6-8 weeks of age (EPI-2). The study is divided into 3 components inclusive of an open-label randomized controlled trial aiming to assess the efficacy of a responsive preventive intervention compared to routine intervention based on the national PMTCT guidelines for HIV-1 uninfected exposed breastfeeding infants. The preventive intervention includes: a) Point of care testing for early infant HIV diagnosis and maternal viral load; b) infant, single-drug Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) (lamivudine) if mothers are virally unsuppressed. The primary outcome is HIV-transmission rate from EPI-2 to 12 months. The study targets to screen 37,000 mother/infant pairs in Zambia and Burkina Faso to identify 2000 mother/infant pairs for the clinical trial. The study design and challenges faced during study implementation are described, including the COVID-19 pandemic and the amended HIV guidelines in Zambia in 2020 (triple-drug PrEP in HIV exposed infants guided by quarterly maternal viral load).

Moreover, regional differences are also conceivable since the extend and severity of outbreaks varied among countries. METHODS: In this retrospective, observational, single-center study, we analyzed the clinical course and outcomes of 37 maintenance hemodialysis patients (median age 64 years, 51% men) hospitalized with COVID-19 from 24 March to 22 May 2020 as confirmed by real-time PCR. RESULTS: The most common symptoms at admission were fatigue (51%), fever (43%), dyspnea (38%) and cough (35%). There were 59% mild/moderate patients and 41% severe/critical patients. Patients in the severe/critical group had a significantly higher atherosclerotic burden since diabetic kidney disease and vascular nephropathies were the most common primary kidney diseases and eighty percent of them had coronary heart disease. Also, Charlson comorbidity score was higher in this group. At admission chest X-ray, 46% had ground-glass abnormalities. Overall, 60% patients received hydroxychloroquine, 22% lopinavir-ritonavir, 11% tocilizumab, 24% systemic glucocorticoids, and 54% received prophylactic anticoagulation. Seven (19%) patients died during hospitalization and 30 were discharged. The main causes of death were cardiovascular (5 patients) and respiratory distress syndrome (2 patients). In Cox regression analysis, lower oxygen saturation, anemia and hypoalbuminemia at admission were associated with increased mortality. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, we observed a high mortality rate among maintenance hemodialysis patients hospitalized for COVID-19.

The Global Commission for the Certification of Poliomyelitis Eradication (GCC) declared two of the three WPV types, type 2 (WPV2) and type 3 (WPV3), eradicated globally in 2015 and 2019, respectively (1). Wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) remains endemic in Afghanistan and Pakistan (1). Containment under strict biorisk management measures is vital to prevent reintroduction of eradicated polioviruses into communities from poliovirus facilities. In 2015, Member States committed to contain type 2 polioviruses (PV2) in poliovirus-essential facilities (PEFs) certified in accordance with a global standard (2). Member states agreed to report national PV2 inventories annually, destroy unneeded PV2 materials, and, if retaining PV2 materials, establish national authorities for containment (NACs) and a PEF auditing process. Since declaration of WPV3 eradication in October 2019, these activities are also required with WPV3 materials. Despite challenges faced during 2019-2020, including the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the global poliovirus containment program continues to work toward important milestones.

The final clinical model included four variables: age >- 40 years, cough, absence of sore throat, and respiratory rate >- 22. To create the score, we assigned values to the variables according to their ORs: 2 points for respiratory rate >- 22 and 1 point to the other variables. The AUC of the ROC curve was 0.80 (CI 95% 0.73-0.86). A cutoff value of 2 showed a sensitivity of 95.7% and a specificity of 43.24%. CONCLUSION: This sensible score may improve the risk stratification of COVID-19 patients in the pre-hospital setting.","Hormanstorfer, Macarena; Ragusa, Martin A; Poggio, Lucia; Moreira-Facundo, Jorge; Orellana-Villa, Zulma; Bobrowski, Florencia A; Martinez-Serventi, Joaquin; Piombi Adanza, Santiago N; Enrique Barletta, Jose A; Sisto, Alicia; Delle-Piane, Hugo; Carrillo, Juan M; Presas, Jose L; Paulin, Francisco",Rev. invest. clin,198,1

Here, we combine several of these (epidemic) models to create a (pandemic) model of viral spread among regions. Our focus is on a second wave of new cases that may result from loss of immunity--and the exchange of people between regions--and how mortality rates can be ameliorated under different strategic responses. In particular, we consider hard or soft social distancing strategies predicated on national (Federal) or regional (State) estimates of the prevalence of infection in the population. The modelling is demonstrated using timeseries of new cases and deaths from the United States to estimate the parameters of a factorial (compartmental) epidemiological model of each State and, crucially, coupling between States. Using Bayesian model reduction, we identify the effective connectivity between States that best explains the initial phases of the outbreak in the United States. Using the ensuing posterior parameter estimates, we then evaluate the likely outcomes of different policies in terms of mortality, working days lost due to lockdown and demands upon critical care. The provisional results of this modelling suggest that social distancing and loss of immunity are the two key factors that underwrite a return to endemic equilibrium.","Friston, Karl J.; Parr, Thomas; Zeidman, Peter; Razi, Adeel; Flandin, Guillaume; Daunizeau, Jean; Hulme, Oliver J.; Billig, Alexander J.; Litvak, Vladimir; Price, Cathy J.; Moran, Rosalyn J.; Lambert, Christian",,198,22

A rising number of atypical infections have been reported. Thus, scientists and clinicians are doing hard work to unravel scientific knowledge about this novel pandemic. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present work was to highlight the oral manifestations which could be observed in mild-to-moderate cases of COVID-19. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A questionnaire survey was performed on 665 Egyptian patients who were confirmed COVID-19-positive based on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. After applying the exclusion criteria, cases with mild-to-moderate symptoms were included in the study. The questionnaire consisted of 4 sections. The 1st section included demographic data, smoking, alcohol consumption, and general health status. The 2nd section contained questions regarding the oral hygiene status of the patients, and additionally a question about the hygienic measures they took while being infected with COVID-19. The 3rd section included questions about the most commonly reported COVID-19 symptoms the patients suffered from. The 4th section included questions that referred to the oral manifestations the patients complained of while being infected with COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 573 patients were included in this survey. It was reported that 71.7% of COVID-19 patients presented with some oral manifestations at a level of significance, with variable incidence - oral or dental pain (23%), pain in jaw bones or joint (12.0%), halitosis (10.5%), ulcerations (20.4%), and xerostomia (47.6%). Some patients (28.3%) showed 2 or 3 manifestations simultaneously. CONCLUSIONS: It was proven that mild-to-moderate cases of COVID-19 infection are associated with oral symptoms, and thus the significance of dental examination of patients with communicable diseases should be emphasized.","Abubakr, Nermeen; Salem, Zeinab Amin; Kamel, Amany Hany Mohamed",Dent Med Probl,198,25

Farmworkers face numerous chemical, physical, and biological threats to their health. The adverse effects of these hazards may be amplified among Latino migrant farmworkers, who are concurrently exposed to various psychosocial stressors. Factors such as documentation status, potential lack of authorization to work in the United States, and language and cultural barriers may also prevent Latino migrants from accessing federal aid, legal assistance, and health programs. These environmental, occupational, and social hazards may further exacerbate existing health disparities among US Latinos. This population is also likely to be disproportionately impacted by emerging threats, including climate change and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

Since the outbreak of the novel COVID-19 there has been a rush for developing Artificial Intelligence techniques for expert-level disease identification on Chest X-ray data. In particular, the use of deep supervised learning has become the go-to paradigm. However, the performance of such models is heavily dependent on the availability of a large and representative labelled dataset. The creation of which is a heavily expensive and time consuming task, and especially imposes a great challenge for a novel disease. Semi-supervised learning has shown the ability to match the incredible performance of supervised models whilst requiring a small fraction of the labelled examples. This makes the semi-supervised paradigm an attractive option for identifying COVID-19. In this work, we introduce a graph based deep semi-supervised framework for classifying COVID-19 from chest X-rays. Our framework introduces an optimisation model for graph diffusion that reinforces the natural relation among the tiny labelled set and the vast unlabelled data. We then connect the diffusion prediction output as pseudo-labels that are used in an iterative scheme in a deep net. We demonstrate, through our experiments, that our model is able to outperform the current leading supervised model with a tiny fraction of the labelled examples. Finally, we provide attention maps to accommodate the radiologist's mental model, better fitting their perceptual and cognitive abilities. These visualisation aims to assist the radiologist in judging whether the diagnostic is correct or not, and in consequence to accelerate the decision.","Aviles-Rivero, Angelica I; Sellars, Philip; Schonlieb, Carola-Bibiane; Papadakis, Nicolas",,198,27

Over 80% of these individuals (1.2 million) received the ChAdOx1-S/nCoV-19 vaccine. In this population, during this period of 4 weeks (mid-March to mid-April 2021), we observed seven cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) that occurred within two weeks of the first dose of vaccination. All 7 patients developed severe GBS. The frequency of GBS was 1.4 to10 fold higher than that expected in this period for a population of this magnitude. In addition, the frequency of bilateral facial weakness, which typically occurs in <20% of GBS cases, suggests a pattern associated with the vaccination. While the benefits of vaccination substantially outweigh the risk of this relatively rare outcome (5.8 per million), clinicians should be alert to this possible adverse event, as six out of seven patients progressed to areflexic quadriplegia and required mechanical ventilatory support.

Systematic appraisal of senior surgeons' consensus can be used to generate interim recommendations until data from clinical observations become available. Hence, we aimed to collect and quantitatively appraise nationwide UK consultants' opinions on clinical decision making for patients requiring cardiac surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We E-mailed a Web-based questionnaire to all consultant cardiac surgeons through the Society for Cardiothoracic Surgery in Great Britain and Ireland mailing list on the April 17, 2020, and we predetermined to close the survey on the April 21, 2020. This survey was primarily designed to gather information on UK surgeons' opinions using 12 items. Strong consensus was predefined as an opinion shared by at least 60% of responding consultants. RESULTS: A total of 86 consultant surgeons undertook the survey. All UK cardiac units were represented by at least 1 consultant. Strong consensus was achieved for the following key questions: (1) before any hospital admission for cardiac surgery, nasopharyngeal swab, polymerase chain reaction, and computed tomography of the chest should be performed; (2) the use of full personal protective equipment should to be adopted in every case by the theater team regardless of the patient's COVID-19 status; (3) the risk of COVID-19 exposure for patients undergoing heart surgery should be considered moderate to high and likely to increase mortality if it occurs; and (4) cardiac procedures should be decided based on a rapidly convened multidisciplinary team discussion for every patient. The majority believed that both aortic and mitral surgery should be considered in selected cases. The role of coronary artery bypass graft surgery during the pandemic was controversial.

However, the incidence of VTE after discharge and whether postdischarge thromboprophylaxis is beneficial and safe are unclear. In this prospective observational single-center study, we report the incidence of VTE 6 weeks after hospitalization and the use of postdischarge thromboprophylaxis. METHODS: Patients hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 were invited to a multidisciplinary follow-up clinic 6 weeks after discharge. D-dimer and C-reactive protein were measured, and all patients were screened for deep vein thrombosis with venous duplex-ultrasound. Additionally, selected high-risk patients received computed tomography pulmonary angiogram or ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scan to screen for incidental pulmonary embolism. RESULTS: Of 485 consecutive patients hospitalized from March through June 2020, 146 patients were analyzed, of which 39% had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Postdischarge thromboprophylaxis was prescribed in 28% of patients, but was used more frequently after ICU stay (61%) and in patients with higher maximal D-dimer and C-reactive protein levels during hospitalization. Six weeks after discharge, elevated D-dimer values were present in 32% of ward and 42% of ICU patients. Only one asymptomatic deep vein thrombosis (0.7%) and one symptomatic pulmonary embolism (0.7%) were diagnosed with systematic screening. No bleedings were reported.

To prepare, scientists have been urged to discover new vaccines and treatments for these emerging viruses. At the same time, political leaders have been urged by global health experts to invest millions in a ""top down"" restructuring of the global health system. This article takes a different view. It focuses on an alternative approach to the scientific discovery of treatments for individual patients, reviews the mechanisms of action and clinical experience with specific drugs that might be useful, and considers whether or not recent lessons regarding this ""bottom up"" approach to treatment have been learned"".

The behavior of an individual inside the collective is distinctive from its behavior alone, as it follows its neighbors. The introduction of such collective behavior in two-dimensional (2D) materials may offer new possibilities to achieve desired but unattained properties. Here, we report a highly sensitive magneto-optic effect and transmissive magneto-coloration via introducing collective behavior into magnetic 2D material dispersions. The increase of ionic strength in the dispersion enhances the collective behavior of colloidal particles, giving rise to a magneto-optic Cotton-Mouton coefficient up to 2700 T-2m-1 which is the highest value obtained so far, being three orders of magnitude larger than other known transparent media. We also reveal linearly dependence of magneto-coloration on the concentration and hydration radius of ions. Such linear dependence and the extremely large Cotton-Mouton coefficient cooperatively allow fabrication of giant magneto-birefringent devices for color-centered visual sensing.","Lan, Tianshu; Ding, Baofu; Huang, Ziyang; Bian, Fenggang; Pan, Yikun; Cheng, Hui-Ming; Liu, Bilu",,198,15

Clinical testing for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 has rapidly become widespread, but data regarding the interlaboratory performance of these serologic assays are limited. OBJECTIVE.­: To describe the development and initial results of the College of American Pathologists (CAP) SARS-CoV-2 Serology Survey. DESIGN.­: Members from the CAP Microbiology and Diagnostic Immunology and Flow Cytometry Committees formed a working group to support development of a new proficiency testing survey for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays. Supplemental questions in the survey assessed the state of SARS-CoV-2 serologic testing among participating laboratories as of July 2020. Results were analyzed for agreement by immunoglobulin (Ig) isotype tested, assay manufacturer, and methodology. RESULTS.­: A total of 4125 qualitative results were received from 1110 laboratories participating in the first survey. Qualitative agreement for assays measuring anti-SARS-CoV-2 total antibodies or IgG was greater than 90% for all 3 samples in the survey. Qualitative agreement for IgM and IgA for the negative sample was greater than 95%, but lacked consensus for the other 2 samples.

The current study aimed to analyze effects of EM through the thoughts, experiences, and suggestions of women who were married under the age of eighteen in Istanbul, Turkey, and the key informants (e.g., social worker, psychologist, obstetrician) who have encountered EM. In-depth interviews were conducted with fifteen women who were married before age 18, recruited from psychiatry outpatient department and eleven key informants. Thematic analysis was used. Low educated, poor family environment with domestic violence and neglect of children, loss of parents, lack of access to education, and traditional social structure were stated as causes for EM. Families' attitudes about EM were characterized as their daughter's reputation would be tarnished which implied the daughter's premarital relationships would be perceived as immoral by community. All women experienced traditional, aggressive rituals for the first night of marriage, husbands were mostly insensitive, and coercive resulting a traumatic experience. Women were subjected to physical, sexual, psychological, and emotional violence; most of them were socially isolated after marriage with restrictions imposed by their spouses and spouses' family that limited communication with their loved ones. The women generally felt unprepared for adult sexual life and motherhood. In order to prevent EM, raising parents' awareness about EM, supporting girls' education, and enforcing legitimate regulations were recommended. Early marriages violate human rights, cause negative consequences for health both physically and mentally, and deepen social inequality for women. All the participants suggested a better functioning legislative arrangement. The male dominated society that legitimizes child marriages and other harmful traditional practices should be addressed.","Baysak, Erensu; Yorguner, Nese; Kandemir, Güler; Denizman, Isik Akyollu; Akvardar, Yildiz",,198,16

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 305 orthopedic surgical procedures in 245 patients (136 males, 109 females; mean age: 34±26.6 years; range, 0 to 91 years) between March 16th and June 27th, 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. The same period of the year before including 860 procedures in 783 patients (364 males, 419 females; mean age: 33.6±25.8 years; range, 0 to 95 years) was also reviewed as a pre-pandemic control group. Patient demographics, surgical indications, COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test status, method of anesthesia, surgical subspecialties (trauma, sports, etc.), trauma mechanisms, and surgical priorities were evaluated. The pandemic and the pre-pandemic periods were compared. RESULTS: The rate of elective surgeries decreased compared to the previous year, and priority C type surgeries had the highest frequency (42.5%). Orthopedic trauma was the leading subspecialty with 91 (29.8%) cases and had a higher share, compared to the pre-pandemic period (17.0%). Hip fractures (18.7%) were the most common cause of trauma surgery, and simple falls (42.3%) composed the largest group of trauma mechanisms, which was similar to the pre-pandemic period (hip fractures, 13.6%; simple falls, 42.5%). The distribution of surgical urgency levels and subspecialties differed significantly between the pre-pandemic and pandemic periods (p<0.001). Post-hoc analysis of subspecialty distribution revealed a significant decrease in arthroplasty (p=0.002) and hand surgery (p<0.001), and a significant increase in trauma (p<0.001) and the ""other"" category (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: Our experience in a tertiary referral center illustrated a shift toward performing emergent and urgent surgeries, when the severity of the outbreak increased. Prioritizing surgical urgencies during the outbreak changed the orthopedic surgery practice with an emphasis on trauma and oncology surgeries. Hip fractures were the most common cause of trauma surgery, and simple falls composed the largest group of trauma mechanisms.","Kamaci, Saygin; Göker, Barlas; Çaglar, Ömür; Atilla, Bülent; Tokgözoglu, A Mazhar",Jt Dis Relat Surg,198,16

Restoration of biomechanics such as leg length, femoral und acetabular offset is crucial in THA. The purpose of this study was to evaluate postoperative differences of these parameters after THA and to analyze their association to greater trochanteric pain syndrome. Furthermore, we aimed to evaluate the clinical relevance of trochanteric pain syndrome compared to patient reported outcome measures. 3D-CT scans of 90 patients were analyzed after minimalinvasive total hip arthroplasty and leg length, femoral and acetabular offset differences were measured. Clinical evaluation was performed three years after THA regarding the presence of trochanteric pain syndrome and using outcome measures. Furthermore, the patients' expectation were evaluated. Patients with trochanteric pain syndrome showed a higher absolute discrepancy of combined leg length, femoral and acetabular offset restoration compared to the non-operated contralateral side with 11.8 ± 6.0 mm than patients without symptoms in the trochanteric region with 7.8 ± 5.3 mm (p = 0.01). Patients with an absolute deviation of the combined parameters of more than 5 mm complained more frequently about trochanteric symptoms (29.2%, 19/65) than patients with a biomechanical restoration within 5 mm compared to the non-affected contralateral side (8.0%, 2/25, p = 0.03). Clinical outcome measured three years after THA was significantly lower in patients with trochanteric symptoms than without trochanteric pain (p < 0.03). Similarly, fulfillment of patient expectations as measured by THR-Survey was lower in the patients with trochanteric pain (p < 0.005). An exact combined restoration of leg length, acetabular and femoral offset reduces significantly postoperative trochanteric pain syndrome and improves the clinical outcome of the patients.","Worlicek, Michael; Messmer, Benedikt; Grifka, Joachim; Renkawitz, Tobias; Weber, Markus",Sci Rep,198,16

One of the main functions of gastric juice is to inactivate swallowed microorganisms, thereby inhibiting infectious agents from reaching the intestine. Studies have documented that proton pump inhibitors are a risk factor for rotavirus, influenza virus, norovirus, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus infections, and are associated with an increased risk of acute gastroenteritis during periods of highest circulation of enteric viruses. In light of the evidence for gastrointestinal infection implying a fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and given the magnitude of the SARS-CoV-2/coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, associated with the widespread misuse of proton pump inhibitors, this suggests that we should not rule out the hypothesis that patients treated with proton pump inhibitors may be more at risk of being infected by SARS-CoV-2.","Charpiat, Bruno; Bleyzac, Nathalie; Tod, Michel",Clin Drug Investig,198,16

Broadly utilising Pierson's concepts of programmatic and systemic retrenchment, it situates the roll-out of activation within shifts toward greater reliance on means-tested benefits for the unemployed, and toward work first, with varying degrees of compulsion, for other working-age adults in the social protection system. Suggesting that this results in a hierarchy of 'welfare sacrifice' for the sake of the competitiveness of the Irish economy, it also looks briefly at how some of these 'sacrifices' are experienced by different groups both in and out of the labour market. The article concludes by noting that the Covid-19 pandemic has temporarily transformed state-market relations such as these;however, whether this offers the opportunity to forge a more supportive turn in activation policy post-pandemic remains an open question.","Dukelow, F.",Administration,198,2

392106,392106,392106,Factors associated to subjective well-being and TB infection in South Africa,18.721657,2.1979768,2021,"Background: The SARS-CoV-2 infection has widely spread to become the greatest public health challenge to date, the COVID-19 pandemic. Different fatality rates among countries are probably due to non-standardized records being carried out by local health authorities. The Spanish case-fatality rate is 11.22%, far higher than those reported in Asia or by other European countries. A multicentre retrospective study of demographic, clinical, laboratory and immunological features of 584 Spanish COVID-19 hospitalized patients and their outcomes was performed. The use of renin-angiotensin system blockers was also analysed as a risk factor. Results: In this study, 27.4% of cases presented a mild course, 42.1% a moderate one and for 30.5% of cases, the course was severe. Ages ranged from 18 to 98 (average 63). Almost 60 % (59.8%) of patients were male. Interleukin 6 was higher as severity increased. On the other hand, CD8 lymphocyte count was significantly lower as severity grew and subpopulations CD4, CD8, CD19, and NK showed concordant lowering trends. Severity-related natural killer percent descents were evidenced just within aged cases. A significant severity-related decrease of CD4 lymphocytes was found in males. The use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors was associated with a better prognosis. The angiotensin II receptor blocker use was associated with a more severe course. Conclusions: Age and age-related comorbidities, such as dyslipidaemia, hypertension or diabetes, determined more frequent severe forms of the disease in this study than in previous literature cohorts. Our cases are older than those so far reported and the clinical course of the disease is found to be impaired by age. Immunosenescence might be therefore a suitable explanation for the hampering of immune system effectors. The adaptive immunity would become exhausted and a strong but ineffective and almost deleterious innate response would account for COVID-19 severity. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors used by hypertensive patients have a protective effect in regards to COVID-19 severity in our series. Conversely, patients on angiotensin II receptor blockers showed a severer disease.","Jurado, Aurora; Martín, María C; Abad-Molina, Cristina; Orduña, Antonio; Martínez, Alba; Ocaña, Esther; Yarce, Oscar; Navas, Ana M; Trujillo, Antonio; Fernández, Luis; Vergara, Esther; Rodríguez, Beatriz; Quirant, Bibiana; Martínez-Cáceres, Eva; Hernández, Manuel; Perurena-Prieto, Janire; Gil, Juana; Cantenys, Sergi; González-Martínez, Gema; Martínez-Saavedra, María T; Rojo, Ricardo; Marco, Francisco M; Mora, Sergio; Ontañón, Jesús; López-Hoyos, Marcos; Ocejo-Vinyals, Gonzalo; Melero, Josefa; Aguilar, Marta; Almeida, Delia; Medina, Silvia; Vegas, María C; Jiménez, Yesenia; Prada, Álvaro; Monzón, David; Boix, Francisco; Cunill, Vanesa; Molina, Juan",Immun Ageing,198,20

A total of 1935 infertile women aged 20-46 years were included in the cross-sectional study and divided into four quartile groups (Q1 to Q4) based on serum T levels. Compared to the subjects in the highest T quartile (Q4), those in the lowest T quartile (Q1) showed significantly lower AMH levels. After adjustment for age, body weight, body mass index and FSH, increasing T quartile categories were associated with higher AMH levels. Binary logistic regression analyses revealed that the odds for the risk of diminished ovarian reserve (DOR) were 11.44-fold higher in Q1 than in Q4 and the odds for the risk of excess ovarian reserve (EOR) were 10.41-fold higher in Q4 than in Q1. Our data show that serum T levels are positively associated with serum AMH levels and suggest that androgen insufficiency may be a potential risk factor for DOR; androgen excess may lead to EOR in infertile women.","Lin, Li-Te; Li, Chia-Jung; Tsui, Kuan-Hao",Sci Rep,198,16

METHODS: We retrospectively identified patients in the Vizient Clinical Data Base® with IS as a discharge diagnosis. The study outcomes were in-hospital death and favorable discharge (home or acute rehabilitation). In the primary analysis, we compared IS patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 (IS-COVID) discharged April 1-July 31, 2020 to pre-COVID IS patients discharged in 2019 (IS controls). In a secondary analysis, we compared a matched cohort of IS-COVID patients to patients within the IS controls who had pneumonia (IS-PNA), created with inverse-probability-weighting (IPW). RESULTS: In the primary analysis, we included 166,586 IS controls and 2086 IS-COVID from 312 hospitals in 46 states. Compared to IS controls, IS-COVID were less likely to have hypertension, dyslipidemia, or be smokers, but more likely to be male, younger, have diabetes, obesity, acute renal failure, acute coronary syndrome, venous thromboembolism, intubation, and comorbid intracerebral or subarachnoid hemorrhage (all p<0.05). Black and Hispanic patients accounted for 21.7% and 7.4% of IS controls, respectively, but 33.7% and 18.5% of IS-COVID (p<0.001). IS-COVID, versus IS controls, were less likely to receive alteplase (1.8% vs 5.6%, p<0.001), mechanical thrombectomy (4.4% vs. 6.7%, p<0.001), to have favorable discharge (33.9% vs. 66.4%, p<0.001), but more likely to die (30.4% vs. 6.5%, p<0.001). In the matched cohort of patients with IS-COVID and IS-PNA, IS-COVID had a higher risk of death (IPW-weighted OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.33-1.82) and lower odds of favorable discharge (IPW-weighted OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.54-0.73).

This article provides background on and explores ""telepresence"" in healthcare literature. Telepresence strongly impacts the patient experience, but it is poorly defined in current research. The aim was to conceptually define telepresence using qualitative methods. DESIGN: Dimensional analysis was used to analyze telepresence in clinical literature and create a clearer definition of telepresence as a concept. Multiple databases were searched for articles related to telepresence. Thirteen international articles related to telepresence were selected for analysis. METHODS: Dimensional analysis allowed for multiple viewpoints to be explored within each distinct context and perspective. FINDINGS: Twenty-five dimensions were discovered within the articles, which were synthesized to seven core dimensions of telepresence: connection, technological mediation, experienced realism, trust, being supportive, collaboration, and emotional consequence. CONCLUSIONS: Telepresence is highly impactful on the patient's experience of telehealth care visits. The conceptual map produced by this dimensional analysis provides direction for clinicians to improve their ability to be present with patients during telehealth care. Potential implications include a starting point for future qualitative research, and the use of this dimensional analysis to inform clinical guidelines, improve clinician training, and assist in the development of new care models. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: A telepresence definition brings clarity to an ill-defined concept. COVID-19 magnifies the need for a better understanding of telepresence, which allows clinicians to improve telehealth encounters.","Groom, Lisa L; Brody, Abraham A; Squires, Allison P",J. nurs. scholarsh,198,1

In March 2020, Congress passed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act,§ which appropriated $750 million for Head Start, equating to approximately $875 in CARES Act funds per enrolled child. In response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, most states required all schools (K-12) to close or transition to virtual learning. The Office of Head Start gave its local programs that remained open the flexibility to use CARES Act funds to implement CDC-recommended guidance (1) and other ancillary measures to provide in-person services in the early phases of community transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, in April and May 2020, when many similar programs remained closed. Guidance included information on masks, other personal protective equipment, physical setup, supplies necessary for maintaining healthy environments and operations, and the need for additional staff members to ensure small class sizes. Head Start programs successfully implemented CDC-recommended mitigation strategies and supported other practices that helped to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission among children and staff members. CDC conducted a mixed-methods analysis to document these approaches and inform implementation of mitigation strategies in other child care settings. Implementing and monitoring adherence to recommended mitigation strategies reduces risk for COVID-19 transmission in child care settings. These approaches could be applied to other early care and education settings that remain open for in-person learning and potentially reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission.","Coronado, Fátima; Blough, Sara; Bergeron, Deborah; Proia, Krista; Sauber-Schatz, Erin; Beltran, Marco; Rau, Katherine Troy; McMichael, Andria; Fortin, Tracye; Lackey, Mark; Rohs, Jovanna; Sparrow, Tracey; Baldwin, Grant",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,198,24

This study investigated the impact and prognostic value of infection on long-term mortality in octogenarian patients with STEMI. METHODS: A total of 1564 patients admitted with STEMI between May 2015 and September 2019 were retrospectively analyzed, and 110 octogenarians were identified and included. Predictors of mortality were determined by multivariate Cox regression analysis. Survival curves were generated using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 85 ± 4 years, and 58 (52%) were male. Median follow-up was 41 months. Patients with infection had higher rates of in-hospital (16.4% vs. 8.2%, p = 0.001) and long-term (33.6% vs. 20%, p = 0.001) mortality. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that infection (HR 3.16; 95% CI 1.52-6.59; p = 0.002) and C-reactive protein levels (HR 0.99; 95% CI 0.98-1.00; p = 0.042) were independent predictors of mortality in patients with infection.

Shock events go beyond what is normally expected in a situation and are characterized by their rarity and potential for severe impacts and long-lasting consequences. These events can significantly disrupt the aviation industry and in the past have led to material structural changes throughout the industry. Anticipating the nature, timing, and scale of such events is impossible, but they are not without precedent and are very challenging to respond to. While the industry has generally adapted to these events and traffic eventually continued to grow, the impacts for many airports have been profound and long-lived. These impacts have typically included a significant change in or loss of air passenger demand and revenue, increased costs, and passenger processing requirements. Impacts have not been uniform, affecting some airports more than others. In fact, during the current COVID-19 pandemic, there have been positive outcomes such as the growth in air cargo. While this project is meant to help airports understand and address significant national or global shock events, methodologies developed for this research may be used by airports to respond to regional and local challenges as well. The objectives of this research are to produce a guidebook and methodology to help airports understand and account for potential shock events in forecasts and planning. These objectives should support the preparation of analyses to better forecast and plan for such events and support airports when reacting and recovering from them. Additionally, the guidebook should provide a discussion of the COVID-19 Pandemic including (1) how the impacts of the pandemic on airports compare to other recent, profound shock events (e.g., September 11 terrorist attacks, the Great Recession of 2007-2009);and (2) possible resultant structural changes to traffic patterns, customer demographics, business models, facility requirements, operating procedures, etc. The guidebook and the methodology should be targeted at airport operators, planners, designers, and other stakeholders involved in operations and capital planning, managing, and financing of airports. The guidance should allow practitioners to consider at a minimum: (1) How different types of shock events may have different impacts on different types of airports (large/medium/small hubs, cargo v. passenger) including considerations for the different types of aviation users at each airport (commercial passengers, cargo, general aviation, military, etc.);(2) Short- and long-term impacts on an airport user’s fleet mix and how that affects the whole airport campus, airfield and terminal planning, arterial roads, airport finances, and commercial tenants;(3) Potential opportunities during a shock event and how they can be leveraged;(4) Specific inputs for use in airport forecasting to reflect shock events, including studying the interaction of shock events with the input variables that are commonly used in forecasting;and (5) Developing a more resilient airport business model.",,,198,22

Individual vaccines are assumed to have no other effect than protection against the targeted pathogen, but vaccines also have nonspecific and interactive effects, the outcomes of which can be beneficial or harmful. To date, no controlled trials and very few observational studies have determined the impact of vaccination schedules on overall health. The balance of the risks and benefits from mass vaccination therefore remains uncertain. Recent studies worryingly suggest links between multiple vaccinations and increased risks of diverse multisystem health problems, including allergies, infections, and neuropsychiatric or neurodevelopmental disorders. Here, we propose that, in susceptible persons, multiple vaccinations activate the retinoid cascade and trigger apoptotic hepatitis, leading to cholestatic liver dysfunction, in which stored vitamin A compounds (retinyl esters and retinoic acid) enter the circulation in toxic concentrations; this induces endogenous forms of hypervitaminosis A, with the severity of adverse outcomes being directly proportional to the concentration of circulating retinoids. In very low concentrations, vitamin A and its major metabolite retinoic acid contribute to immune function and to the process of immunization, whereas excess vitamin A increases the risk of adverse events, including common ""side-effects"" as well as chronic adverse outcomes. The increasing rates of allergy, ear infections, and neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) in countries with high rates of vaccination could be related to mass vaccination and to its impact on liver function and vitamin A metabolism, collectively representing endogenous manifestations of hypervitaminosis A. Further studies of health outcomes in vaccinated and unvaccinated groups are urgently needed, to increase understanding of the pathophysiology and treatment of vaccine injury, to identify the risk factors and screen for vaccine injury, to inform public health policy on potential hazards related to vaccination schedules, and to optimize the safety and benefits of vaccines.","Mawson, Anthony R; Croft, Ashley M",,198,9

Methods: We performed a single-center, observational cohort study. The data from all patients who had tested positive for COVID-19 and had presented with ALI requiring urgent operative treatment were collected in a prospectively maintained database. For the present series, successful revascularization of the treated arterial segment was defined as the absence of early (<30 days) re-occlusion or major amputation or death within 24 hours. The primary outcomes were successful revascularization, early (&#8804;30 days) and late (&#8805;30 days) survival, postoperative (&#8804;30 days) complications, and limb salvage. Results: We evaluated the data from 20 patients with ALI who were positive for COVID-19. For the period from January to March, the incidence rate of patients presenting with ALI in 2020 was significantly greater than that for the same months in 2019 (23 of 141 [16.3%] vs 3 of 163 [1.8%]; P < .001)]. Of the 20 included patients, 18 were men (90%) and two were women (10%). Their mean age was 75 ± 9 years (range, 62-95 years). All 20 patients already had a diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. Operative treatment was performed in 17 patients (85%). Revascularization was successful in 12 of the 17 (70.6%). Although successful revascularization was not significantly associated with the postoperative use of intravenous heparin (64.7% vs 83.3%; P = .622), no patient who had received intravenous heparin required reintervention. Of the 20 patients, eight (40%) had died in the hospital. The patients who had died were significantly older (81 ± 10 years vs 71 ± 5 years; P = .008). The use of continuous postoperative systemic heparin infusion was significantly associated with survival (0% vs 57.1%; P = .042). Conclusions: In our preliminary experience, the incidence of ALI has significantly increased during the COVID-19 pandemic in the Italian Lombardy region. Successful revascularization was lower than expected, which we believed was due to a virus-related hypercoagulable state. The use of prolonged systemic heparin might improve surgical treatment efficacy, limb salvage, and overall survival.","Bellosta, Raffaello; Luzzani, Luca; Natalini, Giuseppe; Pegorer, Matteo Alberto; Attisani, Luca; Cossu, Luisa Giuseppina; Ferrandina, Camillo; Fossati, Alessandro; Conti, Elena; Bush, Ruth L; Piffaretti, Gabriele",J Vasc Surg,198,16

Since juvenile onset of SpA (JSpA) is not well codified by the current juvenile idiopathic arthritis classification, studies in this field are restricted to single categories and therefore cannot be exhaustive. This review aims to report recent advances in the treatment of JSpA. AREAS COVERED: In order to assess the available therapies for JSpA, the authors have analyzed data obtained from retrospective and prospective studies, case reports, and case series, as well as from controlled trials. EXPERT OPINION: Given the challenging classification of JSpA, research in this field has been restricted to single subcategories. Little is known of which patients are more likely to develop axial involvement leading to severe spinal damage. Whether TNF inhibitors are capable to prevent or stop disease progression, once started, is yet to be ascertained with structural damage still a matter for research. Therefore, trials on the efficacy of TNF inhibitors in JSpA are strongly advocated since they may help to elucidate their place as a treatment option.","Marino, Achille; De Souza, Mirian; Giani, Teresa; Cimaz, Rolando",Expert Opin Pharmacother,198,17

This study was performed to analyze the clinical characteristics of patients who succumbed to and who recovered from 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). METHODS: Clinical data were collected from two tertiary hospitals in Wuhan. A retrospective investigation was conducted to analyze the clinical characteristics of fatal cases of COVID-19 (death group) and we compare them with recovered patients (recovered group). Continuous variables were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test. Categorical variables were analyzed by &#967; test or Fisher exact test as appropriate. RESULTS: Our study enrolled 109 COVID-19 patients who died during hospitalization and 116 recovered patients. The median age of the death group was older than the recovered group (69 [62, 74] vs. 40 [33, 57] years, Zâ=â9.738, Pâ<â0.001). More patients in the death group had underlying diseases (72.5% vs. 41.4%, &#967;â=â22.105, Pâ<â0.001). Patients in the death group had a significantly longer time of illness onset to hospitalization (10.0 [6.5, 12.0] vs. 7.0 [5.0, 10.0] days, Zâ=â3.216, Pâ=â0.001). On admission, the proportions of patients with symptoms of dyspnea (70.6% vs. 19.0%, &#967;â=â60.905, Pâ<â0.001) and expectoration (32.1% vs. 12.1%, &#967;â=â13.250, Pâ<â0.001) were significantly higher in the death group. The blood oxygen saturation was significantly lower in the death group (85 [77, 91]% vs. 97 [95, 98]%, Zâ=â10.625, Pâ<â0.001). The white blood cell (WBC) in death group was significantly higher on admission (7.23 [4.87, 11.17] vs. 4.52 [3.62, 5.88] ×10/L, Zâ=â7.618, Pâ<â0.001). Patients in the death group exhibited significantly lower lymphocyte count (0.63 [0.40, 0.79] vs. 1.00 [0.72, 1.27] ×10/L, Zâ=â8.037, Pâ<â0.001) and lymphocyte percentage (7.10 [4.45, 12.73]% vs. 23.50 [15.27, 31.25]%, Zâ=â10.315, Pâ<â0.001) on admission, and the lymphocyte percentage continued to decrease during hospitalization (7.10 [4.45, 12.73]% vs. 2.91 [1.79, 6.13]%, Zâ=â5.242, Pâ<â0.001). Alanine transaminase (22.00 [15.00, 34.00] vs. 18.70 [13.00, 30.38] U/L, Zâ=â2.592, Pâ=â0.010), aspartate transaminase (34.00 [27.00, 47.00] vs. 22.00 [17.65, 31.75] U/L, Zâ=â7.308, Pâ<â0.001), and creatinine levels (89.00 [72.00, 133.50] vs. 65.00 [54.60, 78.75] µmol/L, Zâ=â6.478, Pâ<â0.001) were significantly higher in the death group than those in the recovered group. C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were also significantly higher in the death group on admission (109.25 [35.00, 170.28] vs. 3.22 [1.04, 21.80] mg/L, Zâ=â10.206, Pâ<â0.001) and showed no significant improvement after treatment (109.25 [35.00, 170.28] vs. 81.60 [27.23, 179.08] mg/L, Zâ=â1.219, Pâ=â0.233). The patients in the death group had more complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (89.9% vs. 8.6%, &#967;â=â148.105, Pâ<â0.001), acute cardiac injury (59.6% vs. 0.9%, &#967;â=â93.222, Pâ<â0.001), acute kidney injury (18.3% vs. 0%, &#967;â=â23.257, Pâ<â0.001), shock (11.9% vs. 0%, &#967;â=â14.618, Pâ<â0.001), and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) (6.4% vs. 0%, &#967;â=â7.655, Pâ=â0.006). CONCLUSIONS: Compared to the recovered group, more patients in the death group exhibited characteristics of advanced age, pre-existing comorbidities, dyspnea, oxygen saturation decrease, increased WBC count, decreased lymphocytes, and elevated CRP levels. More patients in the death group had complications such as ARDS, acute cardiac injury, acute kidney injury, shock, and DIC.","Deng, Yan; Liu, Wei; Liu, Kui; Fang, Yuan-Yuan; Shang, Jin; Zhou, Ling; Wang, Ke; Leng, Fan; Wei, Shuang; Chen, Lei; Liu, Hui-Guo",Chin Med J (Engl),198,16

Lio is intrinsically safe by having full coverage in soft artificial-leather material as well as having collision detection, limited speed and forces. Furthermore, the robot has a compliant motion controller. A combination of visual, audio, laser, ultrasound and mechanical sensors are used for safe navigation and environment understanding. The ROS-enabled setup allows researchers to access raw sensor data as well as have direct control of the robot. The friendly appearance of Lio has resulted in the robot being well accepted by health care staff and patients. Fully autonomous operation is made possible by a flexible decision engine, autonomous navigation and automatic recharging. Combined with time-scheduled task triggers, this allows Lio to operate throughout the day, with a battery life of up to 8 hours and recharging during idle times. A combination of powerful on-board computing units provides enough processing power to deploy artificial intelligence and deep learning-based solutions on-board the robot without the need to send any sensitive data to cloud services, guaranteeing compliance with privacy requirements. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Lio was rapidly adjusted to perform additional functionality like disinfection and remote elevated body temperature detection.

It has been conceived and designed to fully exploit the high Strehl adaptive optics correction delivered by the FLAO module, which is being upgraded to SOUL, and will implement different coronagraphic techniques, with contrast as high as 10-6 up to 65 mas from the star. To maximize the achievable contrast, SHARK-NIR has a couple of peculiar features, namely a fast internal TT loop to minimize the residual jitter and a local NCPA correction, performed through a DM inside the instrument itself. Other than high-contrast imaging, SHARK-NIR also has spectroscopic capabilities, with low and medium resolution, and its relatively wide Field of View (18 x 18 arcsec) makes it accessible to other scientific targets, such as galactic jets and disks, as well as extra-galactic cases. Sharing the focal station with another instrument at LBT (LBTI), the design has been kept very compact. This has been achieved through the use of 4 Off-Axis Parabolic mirrors (OAPs) and three flat folding mirrors able to provide two pupil planes and two focal planes required by the coronagraphic techniques implemented.

A decline in the number of new cancers being diagnosed over a relatively short term implies a delay in diagnosis and subsequent treatment. This delay is expected to have a negative effect on cancerrelated morbidity and mortality. The impact of the pandemic on the number of new cancer diagnoses in our setting is unknown. OBJECTIVES: To assess the impact of COVID-19 on the number of new cancers diagnosed at our institution in the first 3 months following the implementation of lockdown restrictions, by focusing on common non-cutaneous cancers. METHODS: A retrospective laboratory-based audit was performed at a large anatomical pathology laboratory in Western Cape Province, South Africa. The numbers of new diagnoses for six common cancers (breast, prostate, cervix, large bowel, oesophagus and stomach) from 1 April 2020 to 30 June 2020 were compared with the corresponding period in 2019. RESULTS: Histopathological diagnoses for the six cancers combined decreased by 193 (-36.3%), from 532 new cases in the 2019 study period to 339 in the corresponding period in 2020. Substantial declines were seen for prostate (-58.2%), oesophageal (-44.1%), breast (-32.9%), gastric (-32.6%) and colorectal cancer (-29.2%). The smallest decline was seen in cervical cancer (-7%). New breast cancers diagnosed by cytopathology declined by 61.1%. CONCLUSIONS: The first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and the associated response resulted in a substantial decline in the number of new cancer diagnoses, implying a delay in diagnosis. Cancer-related morbidity and mortality is expected to rise as a result, with the greatest increase in mortality expected from breast and colorectal cancer.","Van Wyk, A. C.; De Jager, L.

A decline in the number of new cancers being diagnosed over a relatively short term implies a delay in diagnosis and subsequent treatment. This delay is expected to have a negative effect on cancer-related morbidity and mortality. The impact of the pandemic on the number of new cancer diagnoses in our setting is unknown. Objectives. To assess the impact of COVID-19 on the number of new cancers diagnosed at our institution in the first 3 months following the implementation of lockdown restrictions, by focusing on common non-cutaneous cancers. Methods. A retrospective laboratory-based audit was performed at a large anatomical pathology laboratory in Western Cape Province, South Africa. The numbers of new diagnoses for six common cancers (breast, prostate, cervix, large bowel, oesophagus and stomach) from 1 April 2020 to 30 June 2020 were compared with the corresponding period in 2019. Results. Histopathological diagnoses for the six cancers combined decreased by 192 (–36.2%), from 531 new cases in the 2019 study period to 339 in the corresponding period in 2020. Substantial declines were seen for prostate (–58.2%), oesophageal (–44.1%), breast (–32.9%), gastric (–32.6%) and colorectal cancer (–29.2%). The smallest decline was seen in cervical cancer (–7%). New breast cancers diagnosed by cytopathology declined by 61.1%. Conclusions. The first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and the associated response resulted in a substantial decline in the number of new cancer diagnoses, implying a delay in diagnosis. Cancer-related morbidity and mortality is expected to rise as a result, with the greatest increase in mortality expected from breast and colorectal cancer.","van Wyk, A. C.; de Jager, L.

We used wild, habituated chacma baboons to explore two key assumptions of behavioral ecology (i) that observers become a ""neutral"" stimulus and (ii) that habituation is ""equal"" across group members. Using flight initiation distance (FID) methods within a personality paradigm, the behavioral responses of baboons suggested that observers were not perceived as neutral but instead viewed as a high-ranking social threat. Habituation was also not equal across group members, with repeatable individual differences more important than contextual factors (e.g., habitat) in determining the distance at which baboons visually oriented or displaced from observers. A strong correlation between individual visual tolerance and displacement tolerance (i.e., convergent validity) indicated a personality trait. We offer several suggestions for how to account for these factors and minimize potential bias in future studies.","Allan, Andrew T L; Bailey, Annie L; Hill, Russell A",Sci. Adv,198,26

Many patients with COVID-19 develop a hypercoagulable state that has been associated with an increased risk of death. Current treatment guidelines do not support the use for or against empiric anticoagulation. We present a case of a 57-year-old Caucasian male with COVID-19 who was started on full-dose anticoagulation empirically based on an elevated D-Dimer level and was later found to have bilateral pulmonary emboli with right heart strain and pulmonary infarction. Patient had a medical history significant for diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and presented to the hospital on 4/18/20 with fever, fatigue, myalgias, weakness, productive cough, shortness of breath, non-bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain, after testing positive for COVID-19 outpatient on 4/1/20. His O2 saturation was 72% on pulse oximetry. He had no prior pulmonary history. In the ED, chest x-ray demonstrated no abnormality (image 1) and D-dimer was 5325 ng/mL. In light of significantly elevated D-dimer, the patient was started empirically on systemic anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin drip. Due to low pre-test probability and trying to limit further exposure to COVID-19, doppler ultrasound of bilateral lower extremities was chosen to rule out VTE. It was negative. Patient clinically improved over the next day and was subsequently transferred out of the ICU. Prior to discharge the patient underwent CTA to rule out PE on 4/21/20. Results demonstrated acute bilateral pulmonary emboli, including large saddle embolism left main pulmonary artery distally, with right heart strain and pulmonary infarction. Since the patient was hemodynamically stable, no systemic or catheter-based thrombolysis was indicated. Patient was started on a DOAC and discharged on 4/23/20 with oxygen only at night. Although the exact etiology of VTE associated with COVID-19 remains unclear, the available data has shown it to cause a prothrombotic state. Studies have shown the risk of VTE in COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU to be around 2.5-5 times higher than the general ICU population. Our case serves to highlight the need for heightened vigilance for VTE as well as question the utility of common risk stratification tools such as the Well's score in COVID-19. Further studies are needed to identify when and how to anticoagulate patients with COVID-19 in addition to validating risk stratification tools that may aid clinicians in these situations.","Wieckowska, J.; Fitton, K.

In this study, we aimed to assess and compare the impact of lockdown among the Punjab, Delhi, and Gujarat states of India using the Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model by comparing forecasted COVID-19 data with real-time data. Methods We analyzed the COVID-19 data of Indian states from the index case until May 17, 2020. Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (1,1,3) (0,0,0) model was used to forecast the possible cumulative cases until May 17, from data up to May 3, and compared with real-time data. Recovery rate, case-fatality rate, and test per millions of states were collated. Results The trend of cumulative cases in Punjab was moving downward below the forecasted lower confidence limit (R-2 = 0.9799), whereas the cumulative case trend of Delhi was moving along the forecasted upper confidence limit with the forecasted data until May 3 (R-2 = 0.9971) and the trend of cumulative cases was below the forecasted upper confidence limit (R-2 = 0.9992) in Gujarat. Conclusions In Gujarat and Delhi, the lockdown was not effective in controlling the rise in COVID-19 cases even after the 56th day of lockdown, whereas the Punjab state succeeded in preventing havoc of COVID-19. In lieu of lockdown, using facemasks and improving ventilation in closed workspace settings, crowded spaces, and close-contact settings are more pragmatic than keeping away from others in India.","Joseph, J.

The lack of evidence-based data on the management of COVID-19 infection during pregnancy causes an additional stress for obstetrics healthcare providers (HCPs). Therefore, this study was undertaken to evaluate depression, perceived social support, and quality of life among obstetrics HCPs. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional multicenter study was conducted in eight cities in Iran. During the study period, 599 HCPs were separated into direct, no direct, and unknown contact groups according to their exposure to COVID-19-infected pregnant patients. The Patient Health Questionaire-9 (PHQ-9), Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS), and Short Form-36 (SF-36) were used to assess depression, perceived social support, and quality of life. Results: Obstetrics and gynecology specialists had significantly higher social functioning and general health scores compared to other HCPs (residents/students or nurses/midwives). Depression was negatively correlated with most of the domains of quality of life, regardless of the COVID-19 contact status of the study participants. Social support, however, was positively correlated with some domains of quality of life, such as physical functioning, energy/fatigue, and emotional well-being, among staff members who had either direct contact or no contact with COVID-19 patients. Conclusion: During the COVID-19 outbreak, the depression score among obstetrics HCPs was negatively associated with quality of life. Social support, however, had a reinforcing effect on quality of life.","Vafaei, Homeira; Roozmeh, Shohreh; Hessami, Kamran; Kasraeian, Maryam; Asadi, Nasrin; Faraji, Azam; Bazrafshan, Khadije; Saadati, Najmieh; Kazemi Aski, Soudabeh; Zarean, Elahe; Golshahi, Mahboobeh; Haghiri, Mansoureh; Abdi, Nazanin; Tabrizi, Reza; Heshmati, Bahram; Arshadi, Elham",Psychol Res Behav Manag,198,21

METHODS: Forty-three CCP were treated with TP intervention in 45 min sessions, 2 times per week for a period of one month. Children ages ranged 4-12 years (X = 7.04; SD = 2.59). All children presented with velopharyngeal insufficiency (VPI) and compensatory articulation (CA) after palatal repair. TP was provided in small groups (5-6 children) following the principles of the Whole Language Model (WLM). Severity of CA was evaluated by a standardized scale at the onset and at the end of the TP period. RESULTS: At the onset of the TP intervention period, 84% of the patients demonstrated severe CA. At the end of the TP period there was a significant improvement in severity of CA (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggests that TP can be a safe and reliable tool for improving CA.

We implemented a standardized telephone outreach process targeting patients without active electronic portal accounts to improve remote symptom monitoring. Outreach resulted in 172 completed screens, identifying 110 needs for 63 individuals. Twenty-eight patients completed patient portal enrollment. Outreach calls captured a higher percentage of Black patients (34%) and a higher percentage of 61-80 year olds (69%) compared to portal users. Telephone outreach during the pandemic captured data that otherwise would have been missed in elderly and minority patients without electronic patient portal access.

In this work we demonstrate the working principle of an optomechanical crystal cavity operating under ambient conditions as a sensor of submicrometer analytes by optically monitoring the frequency shift of thermally activated mechanical modes. The resonator has been specifically designed so that the cavity region supports a particular family of low modal-volume mechanical modes, commonly known as -pinch modes-. These involve the oscillation of only a couple of adjacent cavity cells that are relatively insensitive to perturbations in other parts of the resonator. The eigenfrequency of these modes decreases as the deformation is localized closer to the centre of the resonator. Thus, by identifying specific modes that undergo a frequency shift that amply exceeds the mechanical linewidth, it is possible to infer if there are particles deposited on the resonator, how many are there and their approximate position within the cavity region.","Navarro-Urrios, D.; Kang, E.; Xiao, P.; Colombano, M.

Therefore, we summarised the overall characteristics of the entire epidemic course in Lu'an to help cities with a few imported cases better contain the epidemic. A total of 69 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 11 asymptomatic carriers were identified in Lu'an during the epidemic from 12 January to 21 February 2020. Fifty-two (65.0%) cases were male, and the median age was 40 years. On admission, 56.5% of cases had a fever as the initial symptom, and pneumonia was present in 89.9% of cases.

A total of 16 clusters involving 60 cases (17 first-generation cases and 43 secondary cases) were reported during the epidemic. We observed that only 18.9% (7/37) index cases resulted in community transmission during the epidemic in Lu'an, indicating that the scale of the epidemic was limited to a low level in Lu'an city.

The use of a wastewater with increased soluble organics, along with optimisation of the hydraulic retention time (HRT), resulted in the highest VTR achieved by a pilot-scale MEC treating real wastewater. Peak HRT was 0.5-days, resulting in an average VTR of 3.82 kgCOD/m3âday and a 55% COD removal efficiency. Finally, using the data obtained, a direct analysis of the potential savings from the reduced loading on AS was then made. Theoretical calculation of the required tank size, with the estimated costs and savings, indicates that the use of an MEC as a return sludge liquor pre-treatment technique could result in an industrially viable system.","Leicester, Daniel D; Amezaga, Jaime M; Moore, Andrew; Heidrich, Elizabeth S",Molecules (Basel),198,33

We examined changes in the prevalence of major depression and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) between February 2019 and March-April 2020; if there were changes in major depression and GAD during six weeks of nationwide lockdown; and we identified factors that predicted major depression and GAD across the six-week lockdown period. Nationally representative samples of Irish adults were gathered using identical methods in February 2019 (N = 1020) and March-April 2020 (N = 1041). The latter was reassessed six weeks later. Significantly more people screened positive for depression in February 2019 (29.8% 95% CI = 27.0, 32.6) than in March-April 2020 (22.8% 95% CI = 20.2, 25.3), and there was no change in GAD. There were no significant changes in depression and GAD during the lockdown. Major depression was predicted by younger age, non-city dwelling, lower resilience, higher loneliness, and higher somatic problems. GAD was predicted by a broader set of variables including several COVID-19 specific variables. These findings indicate that the prevalence of major depression and GAD did not increase as a result of, or during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in Ireland.","Hyland, Philip; Shevlin, Mark; Murphy, Jamie; McBride, Orla; Fox, Robert; Bondjers, Kristina; Karatzias, Thanos; Bentall, Richard P; Martinez, Anton; Vallières, Frédérique",Psychiatry Res,198,16

This study aimed to assess assess how different instrument settings may affect detectable droplet spread and the patterns of aerosolised droplet spread during simulated sinonasal surgery with powered instrumentation in order to identify mitigation strategies. DESIGN: Simulation series using three-dimensional (3D) printed sinonasal model. Fluorescein droplet spread was assessed following microdebriding and drilling of fluorescein-soaked grapes and bones respectively. SETTING: University dry lab. PARTICIPANTS: 3-D printed sinonasal model. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patterns of aerosolised droplet spread. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: There were no observable fluorescein droplets or splatter in the measured surgical field after microdebridement of nasal polyps at a specific irrigation rate and suction pressure. Droplet splatter occurred when suction pressure was reduced; simulating a surgical condition where there was excessive fluid in the nasal cavity irrigation. Drilling with either coarse diamond or cutting burr resulted in detectable droplets. Greater droplet spread was observed when drilling within the anterior nasal cavity. The addition of a suction catheter reduces droplet spread when drilling. Activation of the microdebrider when there is fluid excess fluid (reduced or blocked suction pressure, excessive mucosal bleeding or irrigation fluid) accumulating in the nasal cavity resulted in detectable droplet spread. High-speed drilling is a high-risk AGP especially when drilling in the anterior nasal cavity, but the addition of suction reduces detectable droplet spread outside the nasal cavity.","Leong, Samuel C; Mogre, Dilesh; Andrews, Peter; Davies, Elgan",Clin. otolaryngol,198,1

Overall postinfection CLAD incidence was 20%. Associations were estimated on postinfection FEV1 for ribavirin vs no ribavirin (+13.2% [95% CI: 7.79; 18.67]) and severe vs mild infection (-11.1% [95% CI: -14.76; -7.37]).

In this study, we aim to evaluate the impact of the current pandemic on racial disparities among stroke patients receiving mechanical thrombectomy (MT). METHODS: We used the prospectively collected data in the Stroke Thrombectomy and Aneurysm Registry from 12 thrombectomy-capable stroke centers in the US and Europe. We included acute stroke patients who underwent MT between January 2017 and May 2020. We compared baseline features, vascular risk factors, location of occlusion, procedural metrics, complications, and discharge outcomes between patients presenting before (before February 2020) and those who presented during the pandemic (February to May 2020). RESULTS: We identified 2083 stroke patients: of those 235 (11.3%) underwent MT during the COVID-19 pandemic. Compared with pre-pandemic, stroke patients who received MT during the pandemic had longer procedure duration (44 vs 38 min, P=0.006), longer length of hospitalization (6 vs 4 days, P<0.001), and higher in-hospital mortality (18.7% vs 11%, P<0.001). Importantly, there was a lower number of African American patients undergoing MT during the COVID-19 pandemic (609 (32.9%) vs 56 (23.8%); P=0.004). CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the care process for stroke patients receiving MT globally. There is a significant decline in the number of African American patients receiving MT, which mandates further investigation.","Al Kasab, Sami; Almallouhi, Eyad; Alawieh, Ali; Jabbour, Pascal; Sweid, Ahmad; Starke, Robert M; Saini, Vasu; Wolfe, Stacey Q; Fargen, Kyle M; Arthur, Adam S; Goyal, Nitin; Pandhi, Abhi; Maier, Ilko; Grossberg, Jonathan A; Howard, Brian M; Tjoumakaris, Stavropoula I; Rai, Ansaar; Park, Min S; Mascitelli, Justin R; Psychogios, Marios N; Spiotta, Alejandro M",J. neurointerv. surg.

Urolithiasis can lead to emergencies and affect renal function during long-term follow-up. Therefore, timely and appropriate treatment is essential. Main text: This is a non-systematic review of the recently published recommendations regarding urolithiasis treatment options during COVID-19. Fourteen publications were the basis of our review. Regarding anesthesia methods, the optimal methods are still unknown. During COVID-19, most of the endo-urologists changed their routine clinical practice and elective surgical treatment approaches. Despite decreasing number of emergency visits and admissions for stone disease, patients tend to have leukocytosis, higher creatinine levels, increased grade 3 and 4 hydronephrosis, and higher incidence of complications compared to non-COVID-19 time. Several alarming indications if present, intervention should be performed within 24 h to prevent irreversible kidney damage, disease progression, or even death. Some endo-urologists prefer definitive stone treatment over temporarily drainage to reduce the number of emergency room visits and hospital admissions, except if infection is present or staged treatment is planned. Several clinical scenarios of non-emergency and non-urgent urinary stones are present; thus, endo-urologists should appropriately weigh patient's risk and surgery benefit to decide to the proper intervention time. If risks outweighed benefits to the patient, postpone the surgery. Renal colic should be managed with medical expulsive therapy and proper pain control with close follow-up just in case it becomes an emergency. Indwelling JJ stent removal or exchange is a matter of debate; some endo-urologists recommend removing, while others recommend postponing. Conclusion: Treatment options for urinary stones have markedly changed during COVID-19 pandemic. The optimal anesthesia methods are still unknown. Emergency intervention is a must if any alarming indications exist. Emergency cases tend to have higher incidence of complications compared to non-COVID-19 time.

General Ventsislav Mutafchiyski, a military doctor, professor at the Military Medical Academy in Sofia, was appointed as its chairman. This paper presents a case study on the public image of Ventsislav Mutafchiyski, its readings and interpretations by the audience, and the specific fan culture that emerged around his media persona during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Bulgaria. Placed in the spotlight of the media at the very beginning of the crisis, Mutafchiyski became extremely popular as the public figure most strongly associated with the fight against the spread of the disease in the country. Around his media persona, shaped in the public imagination as a wartime leader, a fan culture has grown with all its characteristic features and dimensions: fans and anti-fans, affirmative and transformative fandom. As a fictional character, Mutafchiyski has appeared in numerous forms of vernacular creativity: poems, songs, material objects, jokes, fake news, conspiracy theories, and memes. In this way, the General has become the main character of Bulgarian pandemic folklore and the focal point of a participatory pandemic. © 2021, FB and Media Group of Estonian Literary Museum.

METHODS: A case series of patients who were admitted to the ICU due to COVID-19 related acute respiratory failure is described. RESULTS: After cessation of sedatives the described cases all showed a prolonged comatose state. Diagnostic neurological work-up did not show signs of devastating brain injury. The clinical pattern of awakening started with early eye opening without obeying commands and persistent flaccid weakness in all cases. Time between cessation of sedatives to the first moment of being fully responsive with obeying commands ranged from 8 to 31 days.

The aim of this study was thus to compare infiltration rates of PD-1 and PD-L1 expressing tumor infiltrating leucocytes (TILs) in primary ovarian tumor tissue and metastatic intraperitoneal implants and to investigate its impact on overall survival (OS). Tumor specimens (ovarian tumor tissues and intraperitoneal metastases) of 111 patients were used to investigate the PD-1, PD-L1 and CD8 expression rates on TILs and PD-L1 expression rate of tumor cells. The percentages of CD8, PD-1, and PD-L1 expressing subpopulations of TILs differ in primary ovarian tumor tissues and metastatic intraperitoneal implants. High PD-1 among TILs in peritoneal metastases were associated with favorable OS. High PD-L1 expression in TILs was associated with poor OS. Combining both factors in peritoneal metastases revealed an unfavorable prognosis. Primary ovarian tumor tissue and intraperitoneal metastatic tissues in EOC might have different strategies to evade immune control. Those findings are of importance for the process of biomarker assessment to predict patients' response to immunotherapy.","Bekos, Christine; Pils, Dietmar; Dekan, Sabine; Hofstetter, Gerda; Horak, Peter; Reinthaller, Alexander; Polterauer, Stephan; Schwameis, Richard; Aust, Stefanie",Sci Rep,198,10

Later, the pneumonia was associated with a new coronavirus; in February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) gave the name COVID-19 to the new disease, while the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) gave the name SARS-CoV-2 to the virus causing it. By March 11, 2020, when the virus had spread to 114 countries, the number of diagnosed patients had reached 118 thousand and the number of deaths was 4000, the WHO declared the outbreak of the disease a pandemic.

METHODS: We evaluated total HCQ concentrations in serum and plasma from published literature values, frozen serum samples from a pediatric systemic lupus erythematosus trial, and simulated concentrations using a published pharmacokinetic model during pregnancy. For each source, we compared observed or predicted HCQ concentrations to target concentrations with reported antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: The average total serum/plasma HCQ concentrations were below the lowest SARS-CoV-2 target of 0.48 mg/l in all studies. Assuming the highest antiviral target exposure (total plasma concentration of 4.1 mg/l), all studies had about one-tenth the necessary concentration for in vitro viral inhibition. Pharmacokinetic model simulations confirmed that pregnant adults receiving common dosing for rheumatic diseases did not achieve target exposures; however, the models predict that a dosage of 600 mg once a day during pregnancy would obtain the lowest median target exposure for most patients after the first dose. CONCLUSION: We found that the average patient receiving treatment with HCQ for rheumatic diseases, including children and non-pregnant/pregnant adults, are unlikely to achieve total serum or plasma concentrations shown to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. Nevertheless, patients receiving HCQ long term may have tissue concentrations far exceeding that of serum/plasma. Because the therapeutic window for HCQ in the setting of SARS-CoV-2 is unknown, well-designed clinical trials that include patients with rheumatic disease are urgently needed to characterize the efficacy, safety, and target exposures for HCQ.","Balevic, Stephen J; Hornik, Christoph P; Green, Thomas P; Clowse, Megan E B; Gonzalez, Daniel; Maharaj, Anil R; Schanberg, Laura E; Eudy, Amanda M; Swamy, Geeta K; Hughes, Brenna L; Cohen-Wolkowiez, Michael",J. rheumatol,198,6

The disease has a marked predilection for adults, and children are relatively spared. Understanding the age-based differences in pathophysiological pathways and processes relevant to the onset and progression of disease both in the clinical course and in experimental disease models may hold the key to the identification of therapeutic targets. The differences in the clinical course are highlighted by the lack of progression of the SARS-CoV-2 infection beyond mild symptoms in a majority of children, whereas in adults the disease progresses to acute lung injury and an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)-like phenotype with high mortality. The pathophysiological mechanisms leading to decreased lung injury in children may involve the decreased expression of the mediators necessary for viral entry into the respiratory epithelium and differences in the immune system responses in children. Specifically, decreased expression of proteins, including angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and Transmembrane Serine Protease 2 (TMPRSS2) in the airway epithelium in children may prevent viral entry. The immune system differences may include a relative preponderance of CD4+ T cells, decreased neutrophil infiltration, decreased production of proinflammatory cytokines, and increased production of immunomodulatory cytokines in children compared with adults. Notably, the developing lung in children may have a greater capacity to recover and repair after viral infection. Understanding the relative contributions of the above processes to the protective phenotype in the developing lung can guide the trial of the appropriate therapies in adults.","Lingappan, K; Karmouty-Quintana, H; Davies, J; Akkanti, B; Harting, M T",,198,2

Our goal was to evaluate for discordance in SARS-CoV-2 detection in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and tracheostomies based on the site analyzed. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective chart review METHODS: This single-institution study evaluated hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who had tracheostomies placed during their treatment. We analyzed SARS-CoV-2 RNA nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) results after tracheostomy. All included patients had nasopharyngeal (NP) and tracheal (TR) samples taken within a 48-hour period, allowing us to characterize rate of test concordance. RESULTS: Forty-five patients met our inclusion criteria. Thirty-two (71.1%) patients had entirely concordant results after tracheostomy. However, 13 (28.9%) patients had at least one set of discordant results, the majority of which were NP negative and TR positive. There were no statistically significant differences in demographic or clinical variables, including time to tracheostomy and time to testing, among patients with concordant versus discordant SARS-CoV-2 results. CONCLUSION: This represents the first study to examine SARS-CoV-2 RNA NAAT concordance between NP and TR sites in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and tracheostomies. One-third of patients demonstrated discordant testing when NP and TR specimens were collected within a 48-hour time period. Thus, patients with tracheostomies may have a higher false-negative rate if only one site is assessed for SARS-CoV-2. We recommend analyzing samples from both the nasopharynx and trachea for these patients until more prospective data exist.

Still, the goals are consistent: to improve patient experience, lower costs, reduce risk, and provide insights into a wide range of care and management issues. Most health systems face similar challenges, such as margin enhancement, quality improvement, increased access, and fending off disruptive competition. Systemness is a way to address these challenges while improving the overall interdependence of the organization. Although embraced by and advantageous to healthcare organizations, systemness efforts often fail. The obstacles are surmountable when organizations thoroughly analyze the achievable scale of systemness, community resources, and current mindset regarding the good of the whole. Leaders must play a vital role in promoting systemness by providing education and a routine review of day-to-day organizational activities. Sometimes, systemness requires a change in leadership or an updating of leadership skills.Organizations must recognize and assess their culture as it relates to principles of independence versus interdependence, and refocus clinical standardization through best-practice protocols and policies as COVID-19 affects the already-fractured healthcare sector. Fortunately, current and developing artificial intelligence, wearables, at-home testing, and improved technologies promise to provide a needed break for a contracting physician field and fatigued front line, and they present an opportunity for those organizations poised to meet the systemness challenge.","Stokes, Charles D; Brace, Rod",Front Health Serv Manage,198,0

This study also aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a negative-pressure environment around the face in preventing the escape of small aerosolized particles. STUDY DESIGN: This study is an evaluation study with specific methodology described below. SETTING: This study was performed in our institution's fresh tissue laboratory. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A fixed cadaver head was placed in a controlled environment with a black background, and small-particle aerosols were created using joss incense sticks (mass-median aerosol diameter of 0.28 µ). Smoke was passed through the cadaver head, and images were taken with a high-resolution camera in a standardized manner. Digital image processing was used to calculate relative amounts of small-particle escape from a variety of masks, including a standard surgical mask, a modified Ambu mask, and our negative airway pressure respirator (NAPR). RESULTS: Significant amounts of aerosolized particles escaped during the trials with no mask, a standard surgical mask, and the NAPR without suction. When suction was applied to the NAPR, creating a negative-pressure system, no particle escape was noted. CONCLUSION: We present a new and effective method for the study of small-particle aerosols as a step toward better understanding the spread of these particles and the transmission of coronavirus disease 2019. We also present the concept of an NAPR to better protect health care workers from aerosols generated from the upper and lower airways.","Khoury, Tawfiq; Lavergne, Pascal; Chitguppi, Chandala; Rabinowitz, Mindy; Nyquist, Gurston; Rosen, Marc; Evans, James",Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,198,16

METHOD: Following a focus group session with eight practicing DNPs, the focus group shared how their roles effected safer health care. RESULTS: Final takeaways included their commitment to safer health care and prevention, moving care to the community, and a wish for more variety in projects generated in workplaces. Three themes emerged from the data: DNP leadership practice affects health outcomes through improved quality of care, influence, and innovation; DNP strengths include communication, leadership, and ability to change others' thinking; and the influence of DNP-prepared leaders at all external levels occurs through both increasing awareness of the role and influencing in multiple areas. DNP challenges include lack of understanding by others of the role and the lack of recognition and respect for their educational preparation.

Timing for operations of the cardio-vascular system may be well programmed in most cases. Hence, the level of priorities must be defined for any single patient. The postponement of surgery may be convenient for most cases, if it is made in the best interest of the patient. The preanesthetic evaluation should be attentive of the respiratory history of the patient. Cardiac anesthesia always implies some respiratory monitoring; hence the existing clinical situation of the patient's respiratory system should be clear. In case of emergency surgery, the patient should be treated as if they potentially have or are at risk for the virus.

Xin guan No.1 (XG-1) prescription is a preventive formula recommended by the Hunan Provincial Administration of TCM to prevent the pandemic of COVID-19. AIM OF THE STUDY: To explore the potential preventive mechanisms of XG-1 against COVID-19 in the combination of network pharmacology approach, single-cell RNA expression profiling analysis, molecular docking and retrospective study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Encyclopedia of Traditional Chinese Medicine (ETCM) database was used to determine the meridian tropism, active components and target genes of XG-1. Gene ontology (GO) analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) functional enrichment analysis were conducted by R Cluster Profiler package (3.14.3). Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data of human lung (GSE122960) was downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and analyzed by R Seurat package (3.1.2). Cytoscape (3.7.2) was used to construct the interaction network. The main ingredients in XG-1 were identified by HPLC- Q-TOF- MS and used for molecular docking with COVID-19 3CL hydrolytic enzyme and angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2). A retrospective study of 47 close contact participants from Dongtang Community of Hunan Province was conducted to evaluated the preventive effect of XG-1. RESULTS: According to the network pharmacology analysis, XG-1 formula was closely related to lung-, spleen- and stomach-meridians and include a total of 206 active components and 853 target genes. GO and KEGG pathway enrichment revealed that XG-1 mainly regulated cellular amino acid metabolism process and neuroactive ligand-receptors interaction. The scRNA-seq profiling showed that angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was principally expressed in alveolar type 2 epithelial cells (AT2). 153 genes were up-regulated in AT2 cells expressing ACE2 and 12 genes were obtained by intersecting with XG-1 target genes, of which 3 were related to immunity. Five main chemical ingredients were detected in XG-1 sample by HPLC-Q-TOF-MS. The molecular docking showed that Rutin, Liquiritin and Astragaloside â £ had a good affinity with COVID-19 3CL hydrolytic enzyme and ACE2. Compared with participants who didn't take XG-1, preventive treatment with XG-1gradules resulted in a significant lower rate of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: The present study showed that XG-1 exerts a preventive effect in close contacts against COVID-19. The underlying mechanism may be related to modulate immunity response through multiple components, pathways, and several target genes co-expressed with ACE2. These findings provide preliminary evidences and methodological reference for the potential preventive mechanism of XG-1 against COVID-19.","Wu, Huaying; Gong, Ke; Qin, You; Yuan, Zhiying; Xia, Shuaishuai; Zhang, Shiying; Yang, Jingjing; Yang, Ping; Li, Liang; Xie, Mengzhou",J Ethnopharmacol,198,24

To address this issue, we modified and evaluated an approach by utilizing SARS-CoV-2-specific amplicon amplification and Oxford Nanopore PromethION platform. This workflow started with the throat swab of the COVID-19 patient, combined reverse transcript PCR, and multi-amplification in one-step to shorten the experiment time, then can quickly and steadily obtain high-quality SARS-CoV-2 genome within 24 h. A comprehensive evaluation of the method was conducted in 42 samples: the sequencing quality of the method was correlated well with the viral load of the samples; high-quality SARS-CoV-2 genome could be obtained stably in the samples with Ct value up to 39.14; data yielding for different Ct values were assessed and the recommended sequencing time was 8 h for samples with Ct value of less than 20; variation analysis indicated that the method can detect the existing and emerging genomic mutations as well; Illumina sequencing verified that ultra-deep sequencing can greatly improve the single read error rate of Nanopore sequencing, making it as low as 0.4/10,000 bp.

Chinese Medicine (CM) was extensively used to treat COVID-19 in China. We aimed to evaluate the real-world effectiveness of add-on semi-individualized CM during the outbreak. Methods: A retrospective total sampling cohort of 1788 adult confirmed COVID-19 patients were recruited from all 2235 consecutive records retrieved from 5 hospitals in Wuhan during 15 January to 13 March 2020. Consultation notes, laboratory/imaging investigations, pharmacy and prognosis records were linked by an electronic medical record system and verified by at least 2 researchers independently. The mortality of add-on semi-individualized CM users and non-users was compared by inverse probability weighted hazard ratio (HR) and by propensity score matching. Change of biomarkers was compared between groups and the frequency of CMs used was analysed. Subgroup analysis was performed to stratify disease severity and dose of CM exposure. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the robustness. Change of key biomarkers and the prescription were analysed. Results: The crude mortality was 3.8% in the semiindividualized CM user group and 17.0% among the nonusers. Add-on CM was associated with a mortality reduction of 58% (HR=0.42, 95% CI: 0.23 to 0.77) among all COVID-19 cases and 66% (HR=0.34, 95% CI: 0.15 to 0.76) among severe/critical COVID-19 cases demonstrating dosedependent response, after inversely weighted with propensity score. The result was robust in various stratified, weighted, matched, adjusted and sensitivity analyses. Severe/critical patients received add-on CM had a trend of stabilized D-dimer level after 3-7 days of admission when compared to baseline. Anti-inflammatory, immunomodulating and anti-asthmatic CMs were most used. Conclusion: Add-on semi-individualized CM was associated with significantly reduced mortality demonstrating dosedependent response, especially among severe/critical COVID-19 patients.

The coronavirus disease mainly starts with a respiratory illness and about 5-16% require intensive care management for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi-organ dysfunction. Children account for about 1-2% of the total cases, and 6% of these fall under severe or critical category requiring pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) care. Diagnosis involves a combination of clinical and epidemiological features with laboratory confirmation. Preparedness strategies for managing this pandemic are the need of the hour, and involve setting up cohort ICUs with isolation rooms. Re-allocation of resources in managing this crisis involves careful planning, halting elective surgeries and training of healthcare workers. Strict adherence to infection control like personal protective equipment and disinfection is the key to contain the disease transmission.

The genus Guadua is endemic to the Americas, and little is known about the genetic diversity and structure of species of this genus. This study aimed to evaluate the genetic diversity and structure of two native Guadua species in natural populations in the Southwestern region of the Brazilian Amazon. Therefore, the genetic diversity and structure of Guadua aff. chaparensis and Guadua aff. lynnclarkiae were evaluated with the use of microsatellite molecular markers (SSR). It was verified that the average genetic diversity for the populations studied was considered high ( H ^ e =0.5) compared to other species of bamboo. All populations had rare and private alleles, and none of them presented significant values of inbreeding. The populations were divergent ( G ^ ST = 0.46), resulting in a low apparent gene flow. The Bayesian analysis showed that among the 350 individuals analyzed, five groups (K=5) were formed, with little similarity among the groups (Populations), although two of them presented clonal individuals. According to the results obtained, it can be conclude that populations should be treated as having unique characteristics, mainly when accessed for management and for in situ and ex situ conservation studies.","Silva, Susana M M; Martins, Karina; Costa, Frederico H S; Campos, Tatiana DE; Scherwinski-Pereira, Jonny E",An Acad Bras Cienc,198,32

This has created a demand for a substance whose effectiveness has already been demonstrated in a similar scenario. Glycyrrhizin (GZ) is a promising agent against SARS-CoV-2 as its antiviral activity against SARS-CoV has already been confirmed. It is worthwhile to extrapolate from its proven therapeutic effects as there is a high similarity in the structure and genome of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. There are many possible mechanisms through which GZ acts against viruses: increasing nitrous oxide production in macrophages, affecting transcription factors and cellular signalling pathways, directly altering the viral lipid-bilayer membrane, and binding to the ACE2 receptor. In this review, we discuss the possible use of GZ in the COVID-19 setting, where topical administration appears to be promising, with the nasal and oral cavity notably being the potent location in terms of viral load. The most recently published papers on the distribution of ACE2 in the human body and documented binding of GZ to this receptor, as well as its antiviral activity, suggest that GZ can be used as a therapeutic for COVID-19 and as a preventive agent against SARS-CoV-2.","Chrzanowski, Julian; Chrzanowska, Alicja; Grabon, Wojciech",Phytother. res,198,16

Nonvolatile electrolyte-gated transistors (EGTs) provide prominent analog switching performance, the most critical feature of synaptic element, and have been recently demonstrated as a promising synaptic device. However, high performance, large-scale EGT arrays, and EGT application for spatiotemporal information processing in an SNN are yet to be demonstrated. Here, an oxide-based EGT employing amorphous Nb2 O5 and Lix SiO2 is introduced as the channel and electrolyte gate materials, respectively, and integrated into a 32 × 32 EGT array. The engineered EGTs show a quasi-linear update, good endurance (106 ) and retention, a high switching speed of 100 ns, ultralow readout conductance (<100 nS), and ultralow areal switching energy density (20 fJ µm-2 ). The prominent analog switching performance is leveraged for hardware implementation of an SNN with the capability of spatiotemporal information processing, where spike sequences with different timings are able to be efficiently learned and recognized by the EGT array. Finally, this EGT-based spatiotemporal information processing is deployed to detect moving orientation in a tactile sensing system. These results provide an insight into oxide-based EGT devices for energy-efficient neuromorphic computing to support edge application.","Li, Yue; Lu, Jikai; Shang, Dashan; Liu, Qi; Wu, Shuyu; Wu, Zuheng; Zhang, Xumeng; Yang, Jianguo; Wang, Zhongrui; Lv, Hangbing; Liu, Ming",Adv Mater,198,16

With no cure or effective treatment currently insight, it is vital that factors are identified which will help prevent or delay both age-related and pathological cognitive decline and dementia. Observational data have suggested that hearing loss is a potentially modifiable risk factor for dementia, but no conclusive evidence from randomised controlled trials is currently available. METHODS: The HearCog trial is a 24-month, randomised, controlled clinical trial aimed at determining whether a hearing loss intervention can delay or arrest the cognitive decline. We will randomise 180 older adults with hearing loss and mild cognitive impairment to a hearing aid or control group to determine if the fitting of hearing aids decreases the 12-month rate of cognitive decline compared with the control group. In addition, we will also determine if the expected clinical gains achieved after 12 months can be sustained over an additional 12 months and if losses experienced through the non-correction of hearing loss can be reversed with the fitting of hearing aids after 12 months. DISCUSSION: The trial will also explore the cost-effectiveness of the intervention compared to the control arm and the impact of hearing aids on anxiety, depression, physical health and quality of life. The results of this trial will clarify whether the systematic correction of hearing loss benefits cognition in older adults at risk of cognitive decline. We anticipate that our findings will have implications for clinical practice and health policy development.

The aim of this study was to articulate the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 and to reveal possible factors that may affect the persistent time of positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test, so as to identify which patients may deteriorate or have poor prognoses as early as possible. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study was carried out on 47 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection admitted to XinYu People's Hospital of JiangXi Province. Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratorial, management, treatment, and outcome data were also collected and analyzed. RESULTS: In this study, patients were divided into two groups based on whether their SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid tests in respiratory specimens turn negative within (Group Rapid or Group R) or over (Group Slow or Group S) a week. There was no significant difference in age, sex, travel or exposure history, and smoking history between the two groups. Forty-two patients had been observed with comorbidities. Similar clinical manifestations, for instance fever, cough, sputum, and fatigue, have been observed among patients in both groups, except that patients in Group S were obviously more likely to get fatigue than patients in Group R. Both groups had shown decrease in white blood cell or lymphocyte counts. Chest X-ray or computed tomography scan showed unilateral or bilateral infiltrates. High proportion in both groups has used nasal cannula (89.47% vs. 85.71%) to inhale oxygen. 10.53% of Group S have applied high-flow nasal cannula, while Group R used none. The current treatment is mainly antibiotics, antiviral, and traditional Chinese medicine, while a couple of patients has used methylprednisolone. Only 1 patient out of both groups got even worse despite this active treatment. CONCLUSION: Clinical characteristics of COVID-19 include the exposure history and typical systemic symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, decreased WBC and lymphocyte counts, and infiltration in both lower lobes on CT imaging. Among them, fatigue appears to be an important factor that affects the duration of positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test in respiratory specimens.","Lu, Jingjing; Yin, Qi; Li, Quan; Fu, Gang; Hu, Xueping; Huang, Jianhao; Chen, Lin; Li, Qiang; Guo, Zhongliang",J Clin Lab Anal,198,24

Due to the ubiquity of Internet connectivity and smart devices, social sensing is emerging as a dynamic sensing paradigm to collect real-time observations from online users. In this vision paper we propose CovidSens, the concept of social-sensing-based risk alerting systems to notify the general public about the COVID-19 spread. The CovidSens concept is motivated by two recent observations: 1) people have been actively sharing their state of health and experience of the COVID-19 via online social media, and 2) official warning channels and news agencies are relatively slower than people reporting their observations and experiences about COVID-19 on social media. We anticipate an unprecedented opportunity to leverage the posts generated by the social media users to build a real-time analytic system for gathering and circulating vital information of the COVID-19 propagation. Specifically, the vision of CovidSens attempts to answer the questions of: how to track the spread of the COVID-19? How to distill reliable information about the disease with the coexistence of prevailing rumors and misinformation in the social media? How to inform the general public about the latest state of the spread timely and effectively and alert them to remain prepared? In this vision paper, we discuss the roles of CovidSens and identify the potential challenges in implementing reliable social-sensing-based risk alerting systems. We envision that approaches originating from multiple disciplines (e.g. estimation theory, machine learning, constrained optimization) can be effective in addressing the challenges.

Settings and Design: This was a prospective observational study in a tertiary care center after obtaining the appropriate scientific and ethics committee clearance. Subjects and Methods: Forty-five patients diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, who were treated with intensity-modulated radiotherapy in the time period from March 2018 to May 2019, were enrolled in the study. A planning computed tomography (CT) scan (CTplan) was done for all patients, followed by scans after 15 fractions (CT15) and after 25 fractions (CT25). The volume changes and the subsequent dose changes were assessed and recorded. Statistical Analysis Used: Data entry was done in MS Excel spreadsheet. The continuous variables were expressed as mean + standard deviation. The comparison of normally distributed continuous variables was done by paired t-test. Data analysis was done by SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) version 16.0. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. A multivariate linear regression model was constructed to study the correlation between mean dose to the parotid glands and the other variables. All statistical modeling and analysis were done using SAS (Statistical Analysis Software) version 9.4. Results: Of the 45 patients, 25 were male and 20 were female. The majority of the patients had malignancies in the oral cavity (16) and hypopharynx (14). Most of them had Stage III/IV (AJCC v 8) disease (41). There were a 36% decrease in the PTV-high risk (PTV-HR) volume and a 6.05% decrease in the PTV-intermediate risk (PTV-IR) volume CT15. In CT25, the volume decrease in the PTV-HR and the PTV-IR was 47% and 9.06%, respectively. The parotid glands also underwent a reduction in their volume which has been quantified as 21.7% and 20.9% in the ipsilateral and contralateral parotids in CT15 and 36% and 33.6% in CT25, respectively. The D2 (dose received by 2% of the volume) and D98 (dose received by 98% of the volume) of the PTV-IR showed changes of +3.5% and -0.2% in CT15 and + 4.6% and -0.31% in CT25, respectively.

The mean dose to the ipsilateral parotid gland increased by 14% in CT15 and 19% in CT25. The mean dose to the contralateral parotid gland increased by 17% in CT15 and 25% in CT25. Conclusion: The dose to the parotid glands increases as a result of the changes that occur during the course of radiation. The changes are significant after 15 fractions of radiation. A replanning at this juncture might be considered to reduce the dose to the parotid glands.","Ilangovan, Bhargavi; Venkatraman, Murali; Balasundaram, Subathira",J Cancer Res Ther,198,12

Hospitals are suffering the high degree of patients to be treated for respiratory diseases and the majority of the health structures, especially in the north of Italy, are or are at risk of saturation. Therefore, the question whether and to what extent the reduction of hospital beds occurred in the past years has biased the management of the emergency has come to the front in the public debate. In our opinion, to start a robust analysis it is necessary to consider the Italian health system capacity prior to the emergency. Therefore, the aim of this study is to analyse the availability of hospital beds across the country as well as to determine their management in terms of complexity and performance of cases treated at regional level. The results of this study underlines that, despite the reduction of beds for the majority of the hospital wards, ICUs availabilities did not change between 2010 and 2017. Moreover, this study confirms that the majority of the Italian regions have a routinely efficient management of their facilities allowing hospitals to treat patients without the risk of having an overabundance of patients and a scarcity of beds. In fact, this analysis shows that, in normal situations, the management of hospital and ICU beds has no critical levels.","Pecoraro, Fabrizio; Clemente, Fabrizio; Luzi, Daniela",PLoS One,198,24

Yet the information is lacking on geographical differences of these measures and their associated factors. AIM: Evaluation of prefecture-based geographical differences and associated predictors for the incidence and number of RT-PCR tests for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). DESIGN: Cross-sectional study using regression and correlation analysis. METHODS: We retrieved domestic laboratory-confirmed cases, deaths and the number of RT-PCR testing for COVID-19 from 15 January to 6 April 2020 in 47 prefectures in Japan, using publicly available data by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare. We did descriptive analyses of these three measures and identified significant predictors for the incidence and RT-PCR testing through multiple regression analyses and correlates with the number of deaths through correlation analysis. RESULTS: The median prefectural-level incidence and number of RT-PCR testing per 100 000 population were 1.14 and 38.6, respectively. Multiple regression analyses revealed that significant predictors for the incidence were prefectural-level population (P < 0.001) and the number of RT-PCR testing (P = 0.03); and those for RT-PCR testing were the incidence (P = 0.025), available beds (P = 0.045) and cluster infections (P = 0.034). CONCLUSION: Considering bidirectional association between the incidence and RT-PCR testing, there may have been an underdiagnosed population for the infection. The restraint policy for RT-PCR testing should be revisited to meet the increasing demand under the COVID-19 epidemic.","Sawano, T; Kotera, Y; Ozaki, A; Murayama, A; Tanimoto, T; Sah, R; Wang, J",QJM,198,16

Obesity increases the risk to develop several chronic noncommunicable disease, ultimately contributing to reduced survival. Recently, obesity has been recognized as major risk factor for coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19)-related prognosis, contributing to worse outcomes in those with established COVID-19. Particularly, obesity has been associated with higher hospitalization rates in acute or intensive care and greater risk for invasive mechanical ventilation than lean people. Obesity is characterized by metabolic impairments and chronic low-grade systemic inflammation that causes a pro-inflammatory microenvironment, further aggravating the cytokine production and risk of cytokine storm response during Sars-Cov2 sepsis or other secondary infections. Moreover, the metabolic dysregulations are closely related to an impaired immune system and altered response to viral infection that can ultimately lead to a greater susceptibility to infections, longer viral shedding and greater duration of illness and severity of the disease. In individuals with obesity, maintaining a healthy diet, remaining physically active and reducing sedentary behaviors are particularly important during COVID-19-related quarantine to reduce metabolic and immune impairments. Moreover, such stategies are of utmost importance to reduce the risk for sarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity, and to prevent a reduction and potentially even increase cardiorespiratory fitness, a well-known independent risk factor for cardiovascular and metabolic diseases and recently found to be a risk factor also for hospitalizations secondary to COVID-19. Such lifestyle strategies may ultimately reduce morbility and mortality in patients with infectious disease, especially in those with concomitant obesity. The aim of this review is to discuss how obesity might increase the risk of COVID-19 and potentially affect its prognosis once COVID-19 is diagnosed. We therefore advocate for implementation of strategies aimed at preventing obesity in the first place, but also to minimize the metabolic anomalies that may lead to a compromized immune response and chronic low-grade systemic inflammation, especially in patients with COVID-19.","Cava, Edda; Neri, Barbara; Carbonelli, Maria Grazia; Riso, Sergio; Carbone, Salvatore",Clin Nutr,198,16

The proliferation of open-source software (OSS) repositories has stressed the need to reuse available software artifacts efficiently. To this aim, it is necessary to explore approaches to mine data from software repositories and leverage it to produce helpful recommendations. We designed and implemented FOCUS as a novel approach to provide developers with API calls and source code while they are programming. The system works on the basis of a context-aware collaborative filtering technique to extract API usages from OSS projects. In this work, we show the suitability of FOCUS for Android programming by evaluating it on a dataset of 2,600 mobile apps. The empirical evaluation results show that our approach outperforms two state-of-the-art API recommenders, UP-Miner and PAM, in terms of prediction accuracy. We also point out that there is no significant relationship between the categories for apps defined in Google Play and their API usages. Finally, we show that participants of a user study positively perceive the API and source code recommended by FOCUS as relevant to the current development context.","T.Nguyen, Phuong; Rocco, Juri Di; Sipio, Claudio Di; Ruscio, Davide Di; Penta, Massimiliano Di",,198,16

Here, we performed a robust characterization of the interaction between hydroxychloroquine and double-stranded DNA using single-molecule force spectroscopy and gel electrophoresis. Two different binding modes were identified, namely, minor groove binding for low drug concentrations and intercalation for high drug concentrations, and the sets of binding parameters were determined for each of these modes.

An online survey of clinicians was conducted involving both closed and open ended questions. Service staff identified significant benefits from the changes to the way services were delivered as well as some impediments and challenges. Advantages in the new way of working revolved around the flexibility of the virtual service, with appointments online enabling families to more easily overcome issues of transport, work commitments, childcare and disruption to routines and timing. The online platforms also enabled some family members to participate who otherwise might not have been able to come to appointments in person. Disadvantages included where there were issues with availability and access to appropriate technology or private spaces, or when the young person was very young, very unwell, unstable, isolated or at higher risk.

For a proportion of hospitalized patients, death can occur within a few days, mainly for adult respiratory distress syndrome or multi-organ dysfunction syndrome. In these patients, clinical signs and symptoms, as well as laboratory abnormalities, suggest a cytokine storm syndrome in response to the viral infection. No current targeted treatment is yet available for COVID-19, an unknown disease up to 2 months ago, which challenges doctors and researchers to find new drugs or reallocate other treatments for these patients. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, a growing body of information on diagnostic and therapeutic strategies has emerged, mainly based on preliminary experience on retrospective studies or small case series. Antivirals, antimalarials, corticosteroids, biotechnological and small molecules, convalescent plasma and anticoagulants are among the drugs proposed for the treatment or in tested for COVID-19.

During this pandemic there has been an acute shortage of good quality Viral Transport Medium (VTM) because of increase in number of infected people worldwide. It is also difficult to maintain the transport and storing conditions in line with the guidelines in pandemics. Aim: To assess the feasibility of Oropharyngeal Swab (OP)/Nasal swabs in 0.9% normal saline in place of VTM and to analyse the effect of temperature on nucleic acid detection by rRT PCR on saline samples stored at 4°C, ambient and at higher temperature (37°C). Materials and Methods: The present study was an observational analytical study which included 94 positive and 5 negative samples. Patients' nasal or OP samples were collected as dry swabs and in VTM. Normal saline was added once the samples were received in the laboratory. PCR was done with saline and VTM samples both on day 1. Samples were aliquotted in 3 sets and one set was kept at 4°-8° C and other two at 25°C and 37°C, respectively. All positive samples were further tested on day 3, day 4 and day 6. Results were analysed and compared. Results: Samples in normal saline showed very good sensitivity at all temperatures (4°-8°C, 25°C and 37°C) till day 6. Both the swab samples (in saline and in VTM) showed nearly 100% agreement in rRT-PCR results. Ct value variation was also =±2. Conclusion: Looking into the cost and logistics issues especially during pandemics, saline is a good and cheaper alternative to VTM and with its use, testing capacity can be expanded.

HBoV1 and 14 other respiratory viruses were detected in NPAs and tonsil tissues by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Serology and semi‐quantitative PCR were used for diagnosing HBoV1 infections. Expression of 14 cytokines and transcription factors (IFN‐α, IFN‐β, IFN‐γ, IL‐10, IL‐13, IL‐17, IL‐28, IL‐29, IL‐37, TGF‐β, FOXP3, GATA3, RORC2, Tbet) was analyzed by quantitative reverse‐transcription (RT)‐PCR in tonsil tissues. RESULTS: HBoV1 was detected by PCR in NPA and tonsils from 25 (17%) study patients. Serology results indicated prior nonacute infections in 81% of cases. Tonsillar cytokine responses were affected by HBoV1 infection. The suppression of two transcription factors, RORC2 and FOXP3, was associated with HBoV1 infection (p < 0.05). Furthermore, intratonsillar HBoV1‐DNA loads correlated negatively with IFN‐λ family cytokines and IL‐13. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows distinctively decreased T‐helper(17) and T‐regulatory type immune responses in local lymphoid tissue in HBoV1‐positive tonsillectomy patients. HBoV1 may act as a suppressive immune modulator.","Ivaska, Lotta E.; Silvoniemi, Antti; Palomares, Oscar; Turunen, Riitta; Waris, Matti; Mikola, Emilia; Puhakka, Tuomo; Söderlund‐Venermo, Maria; Akdis, Mübeccel; Akdis, Cezmi A.; Jartti, Tuomas",Clin Transl Allergy,198,24

In this study, we investigate whether patients with ILD are more susceptible to COVID-19 than those without ILD and evaluate the impact of ILD on disease severity in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: A nationwide cohort of patients with COVID-19 (n=8070) and a 1:15 age-, sex-, and residence-matched cohort (n=121 050) were constructed between January 1, 2020 and May 30, 2020 in Korea. We performed a nested case-control study to compare the proportions of patients with ILD between the COVID-19 cohort and the matched cohort. Using the COVID-19 cohort, we also evaluated the risk of severe COVID-19 in patients with ILD versus those without ILD. RESULTS: The proportion of patients with ILD was significantly higher in the COVID-19 cohort than in the matched cohort (0.8% versus 0.4%, p<0.001). The odds ratio [OR] of having ILD was significantly higher in the COVID-19 cohort than in the matched cohort (adjusted OR=2.02, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.54–2.61). Among patients in the COVID-19 cohort, patients with ILD were more likely to have severe COVID-19 than patients without ILD (49.3% versus 13.1%), including mortality (13.4% versus 2.8%) (all p<0.01). The risk of severe COVID-19 was significantly higher in patients with ILD than in those without ILD (adjusted OR=2.32, 95% CI=1.24–4.01). CONCLUSION: The risks of COVID-19 and severe presentation were significantly higher in patients with ILD than in those without ILD.","Lee, Hyun; Choi, Hayoung; Yang, Bumhee; Lee, Sun-Kyung; Park, Tai Sun; Park, Dong Won; Moon, Ji-Yong; Kim, Tae-Hyung; Sohn, Jang Won; Yoon, Ho Joo; Kim, Sang-Heon",Eur Respir J,198,26

We therefore aimed to characterise associations of these characteristics with two main self-reported components of empathy, namely empathic-concern (feeling compassion) and perspective-taking (understanding others’ perspective). METHODS: We asked participants in an internet-based survey of UK-dwelling adults aged ≥18 years to complete the Interpersonal Reactivity Index subscales measuring empathic concern and perspective taking, and sociodemographic and personality questionnaires. We weighted the sample to be UK population representative and employed multivariable weighted linear regression models. RESULTS: In 30,033 respondents, mean empathic concern score was 3.86 (95% confidence interval 3.85, 3.88) and perspective taking was 3.57 (3.56. 3.59); the correlation between these sub-scores was 0.45 (p < 0.001). Empathic concern and perspective taking followed an inverse-u shape trajectory in women with peak between 40 and 50 years whereas in men, perspective taking declines with age but empathic concern increases. In fully adjusted models, greater empathic concern was associated with female gender, non-white ethnicity, having more education, working in health, social-care, or childcare professions, and having higher neuroticism, extroversion, openness to experience and agreeableness traits. Perspective taking was associated with younger age, female gender, more education, employment in health or social-care, neuroticism, openness, and agreeableness. CONCLUSIONS: Empathic compassion and understanding are distinct dimensions of empathy with differential demographic associations. Perspective taking may decline due to cognitive inflexibility with older age whereas empathic concern increases in older men suggesting it is socially-driven.","Sommerlad, Andrew; Huntley, Jonathan; Livingston, Gill; Rankin, Katherine P.; Fancourt, Daisy",PLoS One,198,24

The mental health status of individuals could have a negative impact attributed to this global situation. Therefore, this study was intended to explore the symptoms of depression and anxiety among healthcare workers (HCWs) of Pakistan during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was undertaken by administering a web-based questionnaire between May and June 2020. Two tools, including the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), were employed to measure anxiety and depression symptoms among HCWs. The data analyses were carried out using descriptive statistics, Man Whitney, and Kruskal Wallis tests. Results: Of 1094 HCWs who participated in this online survey, 742 (67.8%) were physicians, followed by nurses (n = 277, 25.3%) and pharmacists (n = 75, 6.9%). The survey respondents had a median depression and anxiety score of 5.00 (7.00–3.00) and 8.00 (11.00–5.00), respectively. A considerable number of HCWs (82.2%) utilized online psychological resources to deal with their psychological distress. Female HCWs, nurses, frontline HCWs, and HCWs aged 30–49 years were more likely to suffer from depression and anxiety (p < 0.05). Conclusion: During the recent ongoing pandemic of COVID-19, there is a mild level of symptoms of depression and anxiety among HCWs.

There is generally, a gap in knowledge on the virus globally as the pandemic evolves and in Ghana, there is dearth of information and documentation on the clinical characteristics of the virus. With these in mind, we set out to profile the initial cohort of COVID-19 patients who recovered in Ghana. METHODS: We reviewed clinical records of all confirmed cases of COVID-19 who had recovered from the two main treatment centres in Accra, Ghana. Descriptive data analysis was employed and presented in simple and relational tables. Independent t-test and ANOVA were used to determine differences in the mean age of the sexes and the number of days taken for the first and second retesting to be done per selected patient characteristics. RESULTS: Of the 146 records reviewed, 54% were male; mean age of patients was 41.9 ± 17.5 years, nearly half were asymptomatic, with 9% being severely ill. The commonest presenting symptoms were cough (22.6%), headache (13%) and sore throat (11%) while the commonest co-morbidities were hypertension (25.3%), diabetes mellitus (14%) and heart disease (3.4%).

The present survey aimed to provide a European overview on the COVID-19 impact on surgical oncology. METHODS: This anonymous online survey was accessible from April 24 to May 11, 2020, for surgeons (n = 298) who were contacted by the surgical society European Digestive Surgery. The survey was completed by 88 surgeons (29.2%) from 69 different departments. The responses per department were evaluated. RESULTS: Of the departments, 88.4% (n = 61/69) reported a lower volume of patients in the outpatient clinic; 69.1% (n = 47/68) and 75.0% (n = 51/68) reported a reduction in hospital bed and the operating room capacity, respectively. As a result, the participants reported an average reduction of 29.3% for all types of oncological resections surveyed in this questionnaire. The strongest reduction was observed for oncological resections of hepato-pancreatico-biliary (HPB) cancers. Of the interviewed surgeons, 68.7% (n = 46/67) agreed that survival outcomes will be negatively impacted by the pandemic. CONCLUSION: The first COVID-19 pandemic wave had a significant impact on surgical oncology in Europe. The surveyed surgeons expect an increase in the number of unresectable cancers as well as poorer survival outcomes due to cancellations of follow-ups and postponements of surgeries.","Stöss, Christian; Steffani, Marcella; Pergolini, Ilaria; Hartmann, Daniel; Radenkovic, Dejan; Novotny, Alexander; Friess, Helmut; Müller, Michael W.",Dig Surg,198,21

To develop a sense of the current opinion in this area, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis. In March 2021, we performed a systematic search of PubMed, the Cochrane library, and Scopus for studies that compared cancer patients who had a blood type of either O or non-O (A, B, and AB). Our objective was to use multivariate logistic regression analysis to determine how ABO blood type was associated with the development of venous thromboembolism. Our selection criteria were met by a total of nine studies in 25,884 patients for the systematic review and five studies in 22,777 patients for the meta-analysis. In cancer patients, we found that non-O blood type was associated with a nearly two-fold increase in risk of venous thromboembolism (pooled OR: 1.74, 95% CI: 1.44–2.10). Additionally, among the eligible patients, 21,889 patients were post-operative urological cancer patients. In these patients, the analysis also showed an association between non-O blood type and increasing risk of venous thromboembolism after pelvic surgery for malignancy (pooled OR: 1.73, 95% CI: 1.36–2.20). Our meta-analysis suggested that non-O blood type is a risk factor for venous thromboembolism among patients with cancer. As blood type is routinely determined preoperatively by objective and standardized methods, we anticipate that our results will be useful for managing venous thromboembolism in cancer patients, especially after pelvic surgery for urological cancers.","Urabe, Fumihiko; Kimura, Shoji; Iwatani, Kosuke; Yasue, Keiji; Koike, Yuhei; Tashiro, Kojiro; Tsuzuki, Shunsuke; Sasaki, Hiroshi; Kimura, Takahiro; Egawa, Shin",J Clin Med,198,28

Among those, medical institutions are under double pressure, fighting the pandemic's effects and, at the same time providing efficient clinical training to their residents. The main aim of the study is to evaluate the preparedness of the educational institutions for the e-learning platform transition for the delivery of medical training and also to evaluate the overall satisfaction level of the participants with their e-learning experience. Methods: This is an observational cross-sectional study design. The survey's sample included 300 medical students and residents of multiple training levels and specialties, coming from more than 15 different cities of Saudi Arabia. Filling the questionnaire required specific inclusion criteria and all obtained data were secured by the Saudi Commission of Health specialty. The main objective was to evaluate the quality of e-learning methods provided by medical universities. For the collection of the data, Survey Monkey software was used and the analysis was conducted with SPSS. Results: The study found that the frequency of digital education use increased by ~61% during the coronavirus crisis, while almost 9 out of 10 residents have used some e-learning platform. It was reported that before the pandemic, participants' online training was deemed to be rather ineffective, given the rate of 3.65 out of 10. However, despite the increase in e-learning use after COVID-19, many obstacles arose duringcthe adaptation process. According to our survey: lectures and training sessions were not conducted as per the curriculum (56.33%); both students and instructors' academic behavior and attitude changed (48.33%); engagement, satisfaction, and motivation in class were rated low (5.93, 6.33, and 6.54 out of 10 accordingly), compared to the desired ones. Still, participants accredited e-learning as a potential mandatory tool (77.67%) and pinpointed the qualifications that in their opinion will maximize educational impact. Conclusion: The study concluded that innovative restructuring of online education should be based on defined critical success factors (technical support, content enhancement, pedagogy etc.) and if possible, set priority levels, so that a more permanent e-learning practice is achievable. Also our study confirmed that students were overall satisfied with the e-learning support of the training method.","Alsaywid, Basim; Lytras, Miltiadis D.; Abuzenada, Maha; Lytra, Hara; Sultan, Lama; Badawoud, Hala; Abuznadah, Wesam; Alhaider, Sami A.; Housawi, Abdulrahman; Apostolaki, Areti",Front Public Health,198,24

Our objective was to characterize outcomes associated with high-flow nasal oxygen use in critically ill adult patients with coronavirus disease 2019-associated acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. DESIGN: Observational cohort study between March 18, 2020, and June 3, 2020. SETTING: Nine ICUs at three university-affiliated hospitals in Philadelphia, PA. PATIENTS: Adult ICU patients with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 infection admitted with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of 266 coronavirus disease 2019 ICU admissions during the study period, 124 (46.6%) received some form of noninvasive respiratory support. After exclusions, we analyzed 83 patients who were treated with high-flow nasal oxygen as a first-line therapy at or near the time of ICU admission. Patients were predominantly male (63.9%). The most common comorbidity was hypertension (60.2%). Progression to invasive mechanical ventilation was common, occurring in 58 patients (69.9%). Of these, 30 (51.7%) were intubated on the same day as ICU admission. As of June 30, 2020, hospital mortality rate was 32.9% and the median hospital length of stay was 15 days. Among survivors, the most frequent discharge disposition was home (51.0%). In comparing patients who received high-flow nasal oxygen alone (n = 54) with those who received high-flow nasal oxygen in conjunction with noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation via face mask (n = 29), there were no differences in the rates of endotracheal intubation or other clinical and utilization outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: We observed an overall high usage of high-flow nasal oxygen in our cohort of critically ill patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to coronavirus disease 2019. Rates of endotracheal intubation and mortality in this cohort were on par with and certainly not higher than other published series. These findings should prompt further considerations regarding the use of high-flow nasal oxygen in the management algorithm for coronavirus disease 2019-associated acute hypoxemic respiratory failure.","McDonough, Gregory; Khaing, Phue; Treacy, Taylor; McGrath, Christopher; Yoo, Erika J.",Crit Care Explor,198,18

These alternative protein products are, as yet, poorly characterized structurally. Here we report the crystal structure of ORF-9b, an alternative open reading frame within the nucleocapsid (N) gene from the SARS coronavirus. The protein has a novel fold, a dimeric tent-like β structure with an amphipathic surface, and a central hydrophobic cavity that binds lipid molecules. This cavity is likely to be involved in membrane attachment and, in mammalian cells, ORF-9b associates with intracellular vesicles, consistent with a role in the assembly of the virion. Analysis of ORF-9b and other overlapping genes suggests that they provide snapshots of the early evolution of novel protein folds.","Meier, Christoph; Aricescu, A.

An alternative strategy that has been tentatively proposed is to shield the elderly and others at high risk of severe disease, while allowing immunity to build up in those at low risk until the entire population is protected. We examine the performance required from a classifier that uses information from medical records to assign risk status for a such a stratify-and-shield policy to be effective in limiting mortality when social distancing is relaxed. We show that under plausible assumptions about the level of immunity required for population-level immunity, the proportion shielded is constrained to be no more than 15% of the population. Under varying assumptions about the infection fatality ratio (from 0.1% to 0.4%) and the performance of the classifier (3 to 4.5 bits of information for discrimination), we calculate the expected number of deaths in the unshielded group. We show that with likely values of the performance of a classifier that uses information from age, sex and medical records, at least 80% of those who would die if unshielded would be allocated to the high-risk shielded group comprising 15% of the population. Although the proportion of deaths that would be prevented by effective shielding does not vary much with the infection fatality ratio, the absolute number of deaths in the unshielded varies from less than 10,000 if the infection fatality rate is 0.1% to more than 50,000 if the infection fatality rate is as high as 0.4%. For projecting the effect of an optimally applied stratify-and-shield policy, studies now under way should help to resolve key uncertainties: the extent to which infection confers immunity, the prevalence of immunity, the infection fatality ratio, and the performance of a classifier constructed using information from medical records. It is time to give serious consideration to a stratify-and-shield policy that could bring the COVID-19 epidemic to an end in a matter of months while restoring economic activity, avoiding overload of critical care services and limiting mortality.","McKeigue, P.

Compared to the untreated control group, treatment with various antcins (antcin-A, antcin-B, antcin-C, antcin-H, antcin-I, and antcin-M) significantly inhibited ACE2 activity in cultured human epithelial cells. Indeed, among the investigated antcins, antcin-A, antcin-B, antcin-C, and antcin-I showed a pronounceable inhibition against ACE2.

Two approaches to this problem are considered: “informal” (focused only on the quality of published manuscripts) and “formal” (taking into account mainly the scientometric indicators of both authors and journals). The continuous commercialization of this process, associated with the emergence of a huge number of publications that require significant article processing charges from scientists to publish the results of their research, is noted. At the same time, the financial interests of publishers promote reducing the requirements for reviewing and editing articles submitted to the editorial board. It is emphasized the need for the appropriate formal scientometric indicators for researchers applying for grants as well as for the corresponding positions and titles, which has arisen at the present stage. According to the author, excessive attention to such formal rankings does not improve the effectiveness of scientific publications, negatively affecting, in particular, the process of blind peer reviewing, grammar and style of manuscripts, statistical processing of data given in articles, design of illustrations, as well as the quality of reference lists.","Khokhlov, A.

Tocilizumab, an interleukin 6 (IL-6) antagonist has been used in COVID-19 ARDS with conflicting results from different parts of the world. Objective To study the treatment outcomes with tocilizumab in patients with COVID-19 ARDS and hyperinflammation using the World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 ordinal scale. Methods An observational study was conducted from Feb 2020 to May 2020 on COVID-19 ARDS patients with hyperinflammation. Results A total of 244 patients with COVID-19 were admitted, out of which 107 had ARDS. Thirty patients had both ARDS and hyperinflammation and received tocilizumab. The mean age was 62.5 years (SD: 13.5) and the majority were male (83%). The mean CRP pre-treatment was 217.5 mg/L and post 48 to 72 hours of tocilizumab treatment was 98.5 mg/L. Twenty-one patients (70%) also received concomitant intravenous (IV) methylprednisolone. Of the 30 patients, seven died and 20 recovered. Ten patients required intensive care unit admission and nine developed nosocomial infections. COVID-19-associated aspergillosis was diagnosed in three patients post tocilizumab treatment. Mortality was significantly higher in patients who developed a nosocomial infection and who required intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV). Post-treatment, clinical improvement was observed in patients who had a median score of 5 on the WHO ordinal scale. Conclusion Our study supports the use of tocilizumab in COVID-19 ARDS patients with a pre-treatment median WHO ordinal severity score of 5 and recommends the monitoring of nosocomial infections and opportunistic infections.","Nasir, Nosheen; Mahmood, Faisal; Habib, Kiren; Khanum, Iffat; Jamil, Bushra",Cureus,198,20

However, understanding the perceptions of using an e-proctoring tool within the online examination experience is still limited. This study explores the first unique experience for students’ attitudes and concerns using an e-proctoring tool in their final exams during the COVID-19 pandemic. It also highlights the e-tools’ impact on students’ performances to guide educational institutions towards appropriate practices going forward, especially as the pandemic is expected to have far-reaching consequences. A mixed-methods analysis was used to examine heterogeneous sources of data including self-reported data and officially documented data. The data was analyzed by a qualitative analysis of the focus group and quantitative analyses of the survey questions and exam attempts. In June 2020, students participated in a focus group to elaborate on their attitudes and concerns pertaining to their e-proctoring experience. Based on the preliminary outcomes, a survey was developed and distributed to a purposive sample (n = 106) of students from information technology majors who had taken at least one e-proctored exam during the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, 21 online exams with 815 total attempts were analyzed to assess how well students performed under an e-proctored test. The study’s findings shed light on students’ perceptions of their e-proctoring experience, including their predominant concerns over privacy and various environmental and psychological factors. The research also highlights challenges in implementing the e-proctoring tool as well as its impact on students’ performance.","Kharbat, Faten F.; Abu Daabes, Ajayeb S.",Educ Inf Technol (Dordr),198,2

One of these classes, enterotoxigenic E coli, is the most common cause of diarrhea in beef and dairy calves in the first 4 days of life. Two other diarrheagenic classes, enterohemorrhagic E coli (EHEC) and enteropathogenic E coli (EPEC), are important causes of disease in human beings, but less well substantiated causes of diarrhea in calves. E coli strains that cause hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic uremic syndrome in humans, express high levels of Shiga toxin, cause attaching-effacing (A/E) lesions in intestinal epithelial cells, and possess a specific 60-MDa EHEC plasmid are known as EHEC. One feature EHEC and EPEC have in common is the causation of intestinal epithelial lesions known as attaching and effacing (A/E). Attaching-effacing E coli (AEEC) is a designation for those E coli strains known to cause A/E lesions or at least carry the genes for this trait, and therefore include organisms that fall into either the EHEC or EPEC classes. Because cattle are carriers of many different serotypes of EHEC, much emphasis has been placed on the public health and food safety concerns associated with the fecal shedding of these organisms. However, much less emphasis has been given to their roles as diarrheagenic pathogens of cattle. The goal of this article is to address the question of pathogenicity, with a review that focuses on the results of studies of natural and experimental infections with these organisms. The authors conclude that there is overwhelming evidence that many different serogroups of AEEC are diarrheagenic pathogens of calves.","Moxley, Rodney A.; Smith, David R.",Vet Clin North Am Food Anim Pract,198,16

Using the term “differential diversification” from Singapore, I examine how the socio‐political life of the pandemic is deeply entangled with the management of low‐waged labour migrants. Techno‐political discourses and practices of pandemic management accelerated the state’s attempts to differently include migrant workers, revealing the bare viscerality of biopolitics already in place prior to the pandemic. I argue that diversity is ordered through a striking co‐production of migrant management and pandemic management. This paper draws upon government discourses to demonstrate that measures of pandemic management contribute not only to the spatial regime of migrant management. They also articulate and rationalise the subject transformation of the low‐waged migrant to the extent that, on top of being a moral risk, they are also now a medical risk.","Ye, Junjia",Antipode,198,16

Governments in different countries have taken drastic actions such as complete lockdown. However, little attention has been paid to food safety and its potential linkage with the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 spread from staff to food products or food surfaces is conceivable. At least, instead of consuming unpackaged or uncovered foods, consumption of boiled or canned foods processed at high temperatures should be preferred. Before consumption, consumers should clean the surface of canned foods. In addition to recommending or enforcing simple precautions, such as using masks, governments must conduct mandatory SARS-CoV-2 tests regularly and intermittently for personnel who handle food materials or supporting materials (e.g., plastic pouches). Local markets, such as those in Wuhan, which sell live animals and exotic foods for consumption, are a concern. Trade of exotic or wild animals, unhygienic marketplace conditions, and not cooking at high temperatures ought to be prohibited.

Traditional healthcare settings can be inaccessible and unwelcoming to people who use drugs, leading to delays in getting necessary care. The objective of this study was to examine SSTI treatment experiences among people utilizing services from syringe services programs. This study was initiated by people with lived experience of drug use to improve quality of care. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey among participants of five syringe services programs in North Carolina from July through September 2020. Surveys collected information on each participant’s history of SSTIs and IE, drug use and healthcare access characteristics, and SSTI treatment experiences. We examined participant characteristics using counts and percentages. We also examined associations between participant characteristics and SSTI history using binomial linear regression models. RESULTS: Overall, 46% of participants reported an SSTI in the previous 12 months and 10% reported having IE in the previous 12 months. Those with a doctor they trusted with drug use-related concerns had 27 fewer (95% confidence interval = − 51.8, − 2.1) SSTIs per every 100 participants compared to those without a trusted doctor. Most participants with a SSTI history reported delaying (98%) or not seeking treatment (72%) for their infections. Concerns surrounding judgment or mistreatment by medical staff and self-treating the infection were common reasons for delaying or not seeking care. 13% of participants used antibiotics obtained from sources other than a medical provider to treat their most recent SSTI. Many participants suggested increased access to free antibiotics and on-site clinical care based at syringe service programs to improve treatment for SSTIs. CONCLUSIONS: Many participants had delayed or not received care for SSTIs due to poor healthcare experiences. However, having a trusted doctor was associated with fewer people with SSTIs. Improved access to non-judgmental healthcare for people who use drugs with SSTIs is needed. Expansion of syringe services program-based SSTI prevention and treatment programs is likely a necessary approach to improve outcomes among those with SSTI and IE.","Figgatt, Mary C.; Salazar, Zach R.; Vincent, Louise; Carden-Glenn, Diannee; Link, Kelly; Kestner, Lauren; Yates, Tyler; Schranz, Asher; Joniak-Grant, Elizabeth; Dasgupta, Nabarun",Harm Reduct J,198,21

Clinical metagenomics (CMg) is being evaluated for translation from a research tool into routine diagnostic service, but its potential to significantly improve management of acutely unwell patients has not been demonstrated. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic provides impetus to determine that benefit given increased risk of secondary infection and nosocomial transmission by multi-drug resistant (MDR) pathogens linked with expansion of critical care capacity. Methods. Prospective evaluation of CMg using nanopore sequencing was performed on 43 respiratory samples over 14 weeks from a cohort of 274 intubated patients across seven COVID-19 intensive care units. Results. Bacteria or fungi were cultured from 200 (73%) patients, with a predominance of Klebsiella spp. (31%) and C. striatum (7%) amongst other common respiratory pathogens. An 8 hour CMg workflow was 93% sensitive and 81% specific for bacterial identification compared to culture, and reported presence or absence of {beta}-lactam resistance genes carried by Enterobacterales that would modify initial guideline-recommended antibiotics in every case. CMg was also 100% concordant with quantitative PCR for detecting Aspergillus fumigatus (4 positive and 39 negative samples). Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-typing using 24 hour sequence data identified an MDR-K. pneumoniae ST307 outbreak involving 4 patients and an MDR-C. striatum outbreak potentially involving 14 patients across three ICUs. Conclusion. CMg testing for ICU patients provides same-day pathogen detection and antibiotic resistance prediction that significantly improves initial treatment of nosocomial pneumonia and rapidly detects unsuspected outbreaks of MDR-pathogens.","Charalampous, T.; Alcolea-Medina, A.; Snell, L.

By March 2020, Korea had reported the second largest number of Coronavirus patients in the world. On the anniversary date (2021), however, with a 51.3 M population, Korea has had 73.115 K patients with 1.283 K deaths, and this stands at 86th in the world. On average, Korea has 14.3 patients per 10,000 people. Air-parcel trajectory analysis and airflows show that in the general westerly region, air parcels and pollutants could flow out and in all directions. This suggests initially that Coronaviruses from source areas in China could transmit to many sink regions and sectors including 228 subdivided counties in Korea. However, there were only relatively small numbers of Coronavirus patients in western sea sides of the Korean Peninsula in comparison with large numbers of Coronavirus disease patients in cities and in eastern sides. In particular, three counties in Korea, including Ong-jin, Mooju and Chang-heung, have zero patients of Coronavirus diseases. This suggests that a long-distance transmission of Coronavirus from Wuhan and other infected cities in China to western Korea likely did not occur. Moreover, there was no evidence on the potential transmission of Coronavirus from neighboring large cities to the above-mentioned isolated counties in Korea which are only 10 ~ 50 km away. In the biosphere, during the transmission stage, the inactivation of Coronavirus by UV rays appeared to occur effectively in 30 ~ 120 min, in agreement with the result of satellite and modeling studies. In turn, the air transmission of Coronaviruses and pollution from China and neighboring cities in Korea apparently had no impact to cause Coronavirus diseases at the 228 counties in Korea. The infection and spreading of Coronavirus diseases to other people in Korea mainly appeared to occur in confined indoor air environments. With the absence and lack of UV rays in indoor environments, Coronaviruses would be active there for hours or days longer than in the outdoor environments.","Chung, Y. S.; Kim, H.

Feline leukemia virus infection was conquered in less than two decades and the mysteries of feline immunodeficiency virus were largely unraveled in several years. After a half century, FIP remains one of the last important infections of cats for which we have no single diagnostic test, no vaccine and no definitive explanations for how virus and host interact to cause disease. How can a ubiquitous and largely non-pathogenic enteric coronavirus transform into a highly lethal pathogen? What are the interactions between host and virus that determine both disease form (wet or dry) and outcome (death or resistance)? Why is it so difficult, and perhaps impossible, to develop a vaccine for FIP? What role do genetics play in disease susceptibility? This review will explore research conducted over the last 5 years that attempts to answer these and other questions. Although much has been learned about FIP in the last 5 years, the ultimate answers remain for yet more studies.","Pedersen, Niels C.",Vet J,198,1

As we learn about the virus and the pandemic, it is becoming evident that it is an age-associated problem that affects the human population. Severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus 2 is one of seven coronaviruses known to infect humans. These are large enveloped non-segmented positive-sense RNA viruses. Our knowledge of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus 2 is extremely recent but is growing daily. There are currently no antiviral treatments against the virus or vaccines for its prevention.

Differential analysis of the spectral signatures found for nucleocapsid versus spike protein demonstrated that the predominant humoral immune response to nucleocapsid was IgG3, whilst against spike it was IgG1. However, the spike protein displayed a strong affinity for IgG3 itself which it would bind from control plasma samples as well as from those previously infected with SARS-CoV2, much in the way Protein-G binds IgG1.

We further showed that two short peptides derived from the interaction domain of nsp10 could inhibit the 2′-O-methyltransferase activity of SARS-CoV nsp16/10 complex, thus providing a novel strategy and proof-of-principle study for developing peptide inhibitors against SARS-CoV.","Ke, Min; Chen, Yu; Wu, Andong; Sun, Ying; Su, Ceyang; Wu, Hao; Jin, Xu; Tao, Jiali; Wang, Yi; Ma, Xiao; Pan, Ji-An; Guo, Deyin",Virus Res,198,28

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the presentation and outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with CKD followed at any of the four pediatric nephrology centers in New Delhi from April 2020 to June 2021. Outcomes, including cardiopulmonary and renal complications, were reported in relation to underlying disease category and illness severity at presentation. RESULTS: Underlying illness in 88 patients included nephrotic syndrome (50%), other CKD stages 1–4 (18.2%), CKD 5D (17%), and CKD 5T (14.8%). Thirty-two of 61 patients with symptomatic COVID-19 and 9/27 asymptomatic patients were admitted for median 10 (interquartile range 7–15) days. Seventeen (19.3%) patients developed moderate or severe COVID-19. Systemic complications, observed in 30 (34.1%), included acute kidney injury (AKI, 34.2%), COVID-19 pneumonia (15.9%), unrelated pulmonary disease (2.3%), and shock (4.5%). Nineteen (21.6%) had severe complications (AKI stage 2–3, encephalopathy, respiratory failure, shock). Eight (11%) of twelve (16.4%) patients with severe AKI required dialysis. Three (3.4%) patients, two with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome in relapse and one with CKD 1–4, died due to respiratory failure. Univariate logistic regression indicated that patients presenting with nephrotic syndrome in relapse or moderate to severe COVID-19 were at risk of AKI (respective odds ratio, 95%CI: 3.62, 1.01–12.99; 4.58, 1.06–19.86) and/or severe complications (respective odds ratio, 95%CI: 5.92, 1.99–17.66; 61.2, 6.99–536.01). CONCLUSIONS: Children with CKD presenting with moderate-to-severe COVID-19 or in nephrotic syndrome relapse are at risk of severe complications, including severe AKI and mortality.

Mathematical modelling can help predict how missed/delayed MDA will affect short-term epidemiological trends and elimination prospects by 2030. MethodsTwo onchocerciasis transmission models (EPIONCHO-IBM and ONCHOSIM) are used to simulate microfilarial prevalence trends, elimination probabilities, and age-profiles of Onchocerca volvulus microfilarial prevalence and intensity, for different treatment histories and transmission settings, assuming no interruption, a 1-year (2020) or 2-year (2020-2021) interruption. Biannual MDA or increased coverage upon MDA resumption are investigated as remedial strategies. ResultsProgrammes with shorter MDA histories and settings with high pre-intervention endemicity will be the most affected. Biannual MDA is more effective than increasing coverage for mitigating COVID-19s impact on MDA. Programmes which had already switched to biannual MDA should be minimally affected. In high transmission settings with short treatment history, a 2-year interruption could lead to increased microfilarial load in children (EPIONCHO-IBM) or adults (ONCHOSIM). ConclusionsProgrammes with shorter (annual MDA) treatment histories should be prioritised for remedial biannual MDA. Increases in microfilarial load could have short- and long-term morbidity and mortality repercussions. These results can guide decision-making to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on onchocerciasis elimination.","Hamley, Jonathan I.

This study’s aim is to identify the causes that lead to this exponential rise in the accumulation of confirmed cases. METHODS: Epidemiological investigation reports were used to reconstruct chains of transmission as well as assess the net contribution of local infections relative to imported cases, infected travelers arriving from abroad. A mathematical model was implemented in order to describe the efficiency of the quarantine-isolation policy and the inflow of imported cases. The model simulations included two scenarios for the actual time series of the symptomatic cases, providing insights regarding the conditions that lead to the abrupt change. RESULTS: The abrupt change followed the Jewish holiday of Purim in which many public gatherings were held. According to the first scenario, the accumulation of confirmed cases before Purim was driven by imported cases resulting in controlled regime, with an effective reproduction number, [Formula: see text] , of 0.69. In the second scenario which followed Purim, a continuous rise of the local to imported cases ratio began, which led to an exponential growth regime characterized by [Formula: see text] of 4.34. It was found that the change of regime cannot be attributed to super-spreader events, as these consisted of approximately 5% of the primary cases which resulted in 17% of the secondary cases. CONCLUSIONS: A general lesson for health policy makers should be that even a short lapse in public responsiveness can lead to dire consequences.","Klausner, Ziv; Fattal, Eyal; Hirsch, Eitan; Shapira, Shmuel C.",Int J Infect Dis,198,16

However, the consensus method for detecting these viruses has not been well established. A rapid and sensitive microarray approach for detection of these viruses and a panel of specific probes covering nine genera and 16 virus species were designed. 70‐mer oligonucleotides were used at the genus level and 50‐mer oligonucleotides were at the species level, respectively. To decrease the interference of the host genome in hybridization, the consensus genus primers were designed and used to reverse transcribe only virus genome. The synthesis of the second strand was carried out with a random primer sequence (5′‐GTTTCCCAGTAGGTCTCNNNNNNNN‐3′). The amplified products were labeled and processed for microarray analyses. This microarray‐based method used the highly conserved consensus primers to synthesize specifically the virus cDNA and could identify effectively Chikungunya virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, Yellow fever virus, Dengue virus, Tick borne encephalitis virus, and H5N1 avian influenza virus.

Viral proteins were visualized and virus production was determined. In PK-15 cells, the capsid protein was expressed between 6 and 12 hours post inoculation (hpi), it relocated to the nucleus between 12 and 24 hpi. At that time, Rep protein was also detected in the nucleus. This sequence of events also occurred in FCM and PAM but nuclear localized antigens appeared later (48 hpi) and in a lower percentage of cells. In PAM, clear differences in susceptibility were seen between pigs. In PAM from two out of five tested pigs, nuclear localized antigens were not detected, whereas in PAM from three other pigs they were seen in up to 20% of the antigen-positive cells. Virus production was observed in PK-15 but not in PAM or FCM cultures. In a second study, the replication kinetics of seven different PCV2 strains were compared in PK-15 cells. It was shown that the two abortion-associated strains had a different replication kinetics in comparison with PMWS or porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome associated strains.

Calculated MP, the product of applied airway pressure and minute ventilation, may serve as an estimate of respiratory muscle workload when switching to spontaneous breathing. The aim of the study was to assess MP’s discriminatory performance in predicting successful weaning from prolonged tracheostomy ventilation. METHODS: Prospective, observational study in 130 prolonged mechanically ventilated, tracheotomized patients in a specialized weaning center. Predictive weaning outcome ability of arterial blood gas analyses and indices derived from calculated MP at beginning and end of weaning was determined in terms of area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and measures derived from k-fold cross-validation (likelihood ratios, diagnostic odds ratio, F(1) score, and Matthews correlation coefficient [MCC]). RESULTS: Forty-four (33.8%) patients experienced weaning failure. Absolute MP showed poor discrimination in predicting outcome; whereas specific MP (MP normalized to dynamic lung-thorax compliance, LTC(dyn)-MP) had moderate diagnostic accuracy (MCC 0.38; AUROC 0.79, 95%CI [0.71‒0.86], p < 0.001), further improved by correction for corresponding mechanical ventilation P(a)CO(2) (termed the power index of the respiratory system [PI(rs)]: MCC 0.52; AUROC 0.86 [0.79‒0.92], p < 0.001).

Severe COVID-19 is associated with substantial pneumonitis and has a number of shared major risk factors with IPF. This study aimed to determine the genetic correlation between IPF and severe COVID-19 and assess a potential causal role of genetically increased risk of IPF on COVID-19 severity. METHODS: The genetic correlation between IPF and COVID-19 severity was estimated with linkage disequilibrium (LD) score regression. We performed a Mendelian randomization (MR) study for IPF causality in COVID-19. Genetic variants associated with IPF susceptibility (P<5 × 10(−8)) in previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were used as instrumental variables (IVs). Effect estimates of those IVs on COVID-19 severity were gathered from the GWAS meta-analysis by the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative (4,336 cases & 623,902 controls). FINDINGS: We detected a positive genetic correlation of IPF with COVID-19 severity (rg=0·31 [95% CI 0·04–0·57], P = 0·023). The MR estimates for severe COVID-19 did not reveal any genetic association (OR 1·05, [95% CI 0·92–1·20], P = 0·43). However, outlier analysis revealed that the IPF risk allele rs35705950 at MUC5B had a different effect compared with the other variants. When rs35705950 was excluded, MR results provided evidence that genetically increased risk of IPF has a causal effect on COVID-19 severity (OR 1·21, [95% CI 1·06–1·38], P = 4·24 × 10(−3)). Furthermore, the IPF risk-allele at MUC5B showed an apparent protective effect against COVID-19 hospitalization only in older adults (OR 0·86, [95% CI 0·73–1·00], P = 2·99 × 10(−2)) . INTERPRETATION: The strongest genetic determinant of IPF, rs35705950 at MUC5B, seems to confer protection against COVID-19, whereas the combined effect of all other IPF risk loci seem to confer risk of COVID-19 severity. The observed effect of rs35705950 could either be due to protective effects of mucin over-production on the airways or a consequence of selection bias due to (1) a patient group that is heavily enriched for the rs35705950 T undertaking strict self-isolation and/or (2) due to survival bias of the rs35705950 non-IPF risk allele carriers. Due to the diverse impact of IPF causal variants on SARS-CoV-2 infection, with a possible selection bias as an explanation, further investigation is needed to address this apparent paradox between variance at MUC5B and other IPF genetic risk factors.

The adaptive learning literature argues that an alternative to achieve student satisfaction is to treat them individually, delivering the educational content in a personalized manner. In addition, the sequencing of this content—called Adaptive Curriculum Sequencing (ACS)—is important to avoid cognitive overload and disorientation. The search for an optimal sequence from ever-growing databases is an NP-Hard combinatorial optimization problem. Although some approaches have been proposed, it is challenging to assess their contributions due to the lack of benchmark data available. This paper presents a procedure to create synthetic dataset to evaluate ACS approaches and, as a concept proof, analyzes metaheuristics usually used in ACS approaches: Genetic Algorithm, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Prey–Predator Algorithm using student’s learning goals and their extrinsic and intrinsic information. We also propose an approach based on Differential Evolution (DE).

There may be additional benefits of virtual visits as they appear to be convenient and potentially cost-saving to patients. People receiving maintenance hemodialysis require ongoing care from their nephrologist and may benefit from virtual visits; however, the optimal model for a virtual kidney clinic is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To codesign and assess the feasibility of a virtual (video) kidney clinic model with clinic staff, nephrologists, and patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis, to be used for routine follow-up visits. DESIGN: Mixed-methods study. SETTING: Two main kidney clinics in central Calgary, Alberta. PARTICIPANTS: Adults with kidney failure receiving maintenance hemodialysis, nephrologists, and clinic staff. METHODS: First, we individually interviewed clinic staff and nephrologists to assess the needs of the clinic to deliver virtual visits. Then, we used participant observation with patients and nephrologists to codesign the virtual visit model. Finally, we used structured surveys to evaluate the patients’ and nephrologists’ experiences when using the virtual model. RESULTS: Eight video visits (8 patients; 6 nephrologists) were scheduled between October 2019 and February 2020 and 7 were successfully completed. Among completed visits, all participants reported high satisfaction with the service, were willing to use it again, and would recommend it to others. Three main themes were identified with respect to factors influencing visit success: IT infrastructure, administration, and process. LIMITATIONS: Patients received training on how to use the videoconference platform by the PhD student, whom also set up the technical components of the visit for the nephrologist. This may have overestimated the feasibility of virtual visits if this level of support is not available in future. Second, interviews were not audio-recorded and thematic analysis relied on field notes. CONCLUSIONS: Video visits for routine follow-up care between people receiving hemodialysis and nephrologists were acceptable to patients and nephrologists. Video visits appear to be feasible if clinics are equipped with appropriate equipment and IT infrastructure, physicians are remunerated appropriately, and patients receive training on how to use software as needed.","Lunney, Meaghan; Thomas, Chandra; Rabi, Doreen; Bello, Aminu K.; Tonelli, Marcello",Can J Kidney Health Dis,198,1

Its risk factors with death were still not known. White blood cells (WBC) count as a reflection of inflammation has played a vital role in COVID-19, however its level with death is not yet investigated. METHODS: In this retrospective, single-center study, all confirmed patients with COVID-19 at West Branch of Union Hospital from Jan 29 to Feb 28, 2020 were collected and analyzed. Demographic and clinical data including laboratory examinations were analyzed and compared between recovery and death patients. RESULTS: A total of 163 patients including 33 death cases were included in this study. Significant association was found between WBC count and death (HR = 1.14, 95%CI: 1.09–1.20, p < 0.001). The regression analysis results showed there was a significant association between WBC count and death (HR = 5.72, 95%CI: 2.21–14.82, p < 0.001) when use the second quartile as a cutoff value (> 6.16 × 10^9/L). The difference was still exist after adjusting for confounding factors (HR = 6.26, 95%CI: 1.72–22.77, p = 0.005). In addition, Kaplan-meier survival analysis showed that there was a significant decline of the cumulative survival rate (p < 0.001) in those with WBC count ≥6.16 × 10^9/L. CONCLUSION: WBC count at admission is significantly corelated with death in COVID-19 patients. Higher level of WBC count should be given more attention in the treatment of COVID-19.","Zhu, Bin; Feng, Xiaokai; Jiang, Chunguo; Mi, Song; Yang, Liya; Zhao, Zhigang; Zhang, Yong; Zhang, Liming",BMC Infect Dis,198,1

Sensitive and rapid diagnostic techniques have been developed and are used in daily clinical practice. Here we evaluate the clinical relevance of detecting 20 common respiratory pathogens by molecular methods in a general pediatric clinic. METHODS: Nasopharynx samples of children < 18 years of age with respiratory symptoms referred to a general pediatric clinic were tested for the presence of 19 viruses and Mycoplasma pneumoniae, using real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Of 177 patients included in this retrospective study, 73% were positive for at least one virus. Respiratory syncytial virus (36.6%) and human rhinovirus (24%) were most frequently detected. Patients in whom a respiratory virus or Mycoplasma pneumoniae was detected, were younger (6 versus 24 months; p < 0.001) and more often hospitalized (116 versus 34; p = 0.001) than patients in whom no respiratory pathogen was detected. Also they were more likely to present with feeding problems, dyspnea, rhinorrhea and wheezing (all p < 0.05) than patients without a respiratory pathogen. In the majority of cases, clinicians did not change their antibiotic management after detecting a viral respiratory pathogen. No difference in mean Ct value was found between patients with one respiratory pathogen and those with >1 respiratory pathogen (30.5 versus 31.2; p = 0.573). CONCLUSION: Routine testing of common respiratory pathogens could lead to a better understanding of their role in disease in children with respiratory symptoms.","Huijskens, Elisabeth G; Biesmans, Renée C; Buiting, Anton G; Obihara, Charles C; Rossen, John W",Virol J,198,16

Both AdAce1 and AdAce2 were highly similar (95 and 93% amino acid identity, respectively) with the Ace genes of Tribolium castaneum. Both AdAce1 and AdAce2 have the conserved residues characteristic of AChE (catalytic triad, intra‐disulfide bonds, and so on). Partial cDNA sequences of the Alphitobius Ace genes were compared between two tetrachlorvinphos resistant (Kennebec and Waycross) and one susceptible strain of beetles. Several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were detected, but only one non‐synonymous mutation was found (A271S in AdAce2). No SNPs were exclusively found in the resistant strains, the A271S mutation does not correspond to any mutations previously reported to alter sensitivity of AChE to organophosphates or carbamates, and the A271S was found only as a heterozygote in one individual from one of the resistant A. diaperinus strains. This suggests that tetrachlorvinphos resistance in the Kennebec and Waycross strains of A. diaperinus is not due to mutations in either AChE gene. The sequences of AdAce1 and AdAce2 provide new information about the evolution of these important genes in insects.

Patient adverse events, such as hospital-acquired pressure injuries (HAPIs), have been problematic for decades. The introduction of a pandemic to an environment that is potentially at-risk for adverse events may result in unintended patient safety and quality concerns. We use the learning health system framework to motivate our understanding of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the incidence of HAPIs within our health system. Using a retrospective, observational design, we used descriptive statistics to evaluate trends in HAPI from March to July 2020. Hospital-acquired pressure injury numbers have fluctuated from a steady increase from March–May 2020, hitting a peak high of 90 cases in the month of May. However, the trend in the total all stage HAPIs began to decline in June 2020, with a low of 51 in July, the lowest number since March 2020. Patients evaluated in this study did not have a longitudinal increase in HAPIs from March–July 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, despite similarities in illness severity between the two time points.

The introduction of MXene (3.4 wt.%) helped to reduce the recombination of photo-induced electrons and holes, and thus enhanced the photocatalytic activity by 30%. A continuous flow-through reactor loaded with the as-prepared photocatalyst coated onto polyurethane foam was developed to inactivate airborne bacteria. The photocatalytic inactivation efficiency of airborne Escherichia coli (E. coli) achieved 3.4 lg order under ultraviolet (UV) irradiation at 254 (UV254), which was superior to that using UV254-only treatment with 2.5 lg order under the same operating condition (95% relative humidity and retention time of 4.27 s). The effect of humidity and bacteria species on inactivation performance was also investigated. The thick cell membrane could protect bacteria from photocatalytic oxidation while high humidity increased the photocatalytic inactivation efficiency by generating more reactive oxygen species. The phenomena of photo reactivation and dark repair of airborne E. coli using UV254-only treatment was observed. However, no reactivation occurred after UV photocatalytic inactivation, and even a continuous decline under visible light. These results suggested a different inactivation mechanism between UV irradiation and UV photocatalysis that the former inactivated bacteria by damaging their DNA, whereas photocatalysis physically damaged their cell structure.","Lu, Siyi; Meng, Ge; Wang, Can; Chen, Hong",Chem Eng J,198,16

Using hot and cold sites has led to a low rate of post-operative diagnosis of COVID-19 infection and allowed safe continuation of important emergency and cancer operations in our centre. Objective: The primary objective was to determine the safety of the continuation of surgical admissions and procedures during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic using hot and cold surgical sites. The secondary objective is to determine risk factors of contracting COVID-19 to help guide further prevention. Setting: A single surgical department at a tertiary care referral centre in London, United Kingdom. Participants: All consecutive patients admitted under the care of the urology team over a 3-month period from 1st March to 31st May 2020 over both hot acute admission sites and cold elective sites were included. Exposures: COVID-19 was prevalent in the community over the three months of the study at the height of the pandemic. The majority of elective surgery was carried out in a cold site requiring patients to have a negative COVID-19 swab 72 hours prior to admission and to self-isolate for 14 days pre-operatively, whilst all acute admissions were admitted to the hot site. Main outcomes and measures: COVID-19 was detected in 1.6% of post-operative patients. There was 1 (0.2%) post-operative mortality due to COVID-19. Results: A total of 611 patients, 451 (73.8%) male and 160 (26.2%) female, with a median age of 57 (interquartile range 44-70) were admitted under the surgical team. Of these, 101 (16.5%) were admitted on the cold site and 510 (83.5%) on the hot site. Surgical procedures were performed in 495 patients of which 8 (1.6%) contracted COVID-19 post-operatively with 1 (0.2%) post-operative mortality due to COVID-19. Overall, COVID-19 was detected in 20 (3.3%) patients with 2 (0.3%) deaths. On multivariate analysis, length of stay was associated with contracting COVID-19 in our cohort (OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.13-1.39). Conclusions and Relevance: Continuation of surgical procedures using hot and cold sites throughout the COVID-19 pandemic was safe practice, although the risk of COVID-19 remained and is underlined by a post-operative mortality.

This disease is of considerable economic importance and is primarily controlled through biosecurity and immunization with live attenuated and inactivated IB vaccines of various serotypes. In the present study, we tested the safety and efficacy of an attenuated predominant Chinese QX-like IBV strain. The results revealed that the attenuated strain has a clear decrease in pathogenicity for specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chickens compared with the parent strain. Strain YN-inoculated birds had clinical signs of varying severity with 30% mortality, while the attenuated group appeared healthy, with less tissue damage. The attenuated strain also had relatively low tissue replication rates and higher antibody levels. The superior protective efficacy of the attenuated strain was observed when vaccinated birds were challenged with a homologous or heterologous field IBV strain, indicating the potential of the attenuated YN (aYN) as a vaccine. Producing a vaccine targeting the abundant serotype in China is essential to reducing the economic impact of IB on the poultry industry.","Zhao, Ye; Cheng, Jin-long; Liu, Xiao-yu; Zhao, Jing; Hu, Yan-xin; Zhang, Guo-zhong",Vet Microbiol,198,9

The World Health Organisation (WHO) releases guidelines to help the countries to reduce the spread of this virus to the public, like wearing masks, hand hygiene, social distancing, shutting down all types of public transports, etc. These conditions led to a worldwide economic fall drastically, and on the other hand, indirect environmental benefits like global air quality improvement and decreased water pollution are also pictured. Currently, use of face masks is part of a comprehensive package of the prevention and control measures that can limit the spread of COVID-19 since there is no clinically proven drugs or vaccine available for COVID-19. Mostly, face masks are made of petroleum-based non-renewable polymers that are non-biodegradable, hazardous to the environment and create health issues. This study demonstrates the extensive use of the face mask and how it affects human health and the marine ecosystem. It has become a great challenge for the government sectors to impose strict regulations for the proper disposal of the masks as medical waste by the public. Neglecting the seriousness of this issue may lead to the release of large tonnes of micro-plastics to the landfill as well as to the marine environment where mostly end-up and thereby affecting their fauna and flora population vastly.

Majority of these scores were devised in western countries and their cross-cultural compatibility is rarely demonstrated. The World Health Organisation quality of life (WHOQOL-BREF) questionnaire is one of the best known multilingual instruments for such assessment which has 4 domains. Its reliability has never been demonstrated for THR and the present study was conceptualised for the same. METHODS: THRs done over 6 years were followed up retrospectively. Revision THRs and hemiarthroplasties were excluded. All the cases were done by a single senior arthroplasty surgeon. Clinical examination was done and questionnaires for WHO QOL-BREF and Harris Hip scores were given to the patients. RESULTS: The number of patients included in the study was 96 with 115 operated hips. The average age of these patients was 41.40 years ranging from 17 to 80 years. There was strong male preponderance in our series of patients with 90 THRs. The mean score of domain 1 was 70.8 (SD 21.6), domain 2: 72.4 (SD 18.8), domain 3: 74.7 (SD 16.8) and domain 4: 75.4 (SD 14.8), which showed significant functional improvement post THR in domain 2 (P = 0.0001), domain 3 (P = 0.0010) and domain 4(P = 0.0001), when compared to scores of general healthy population. Similarly, the scores were significantly improved in all domains as compared to cohorts of post-operative acetabular and hip fractures. The score was found to be a reliable tool with Cronbach's alpha of 0.912 and strong correlation was present with the standard Harris hip scores (p = 0.000). CONCLUSION: WHO QOL is a potent tool to assess the quality of life in patients undergoing THR. It can be used as a single index of measurement and it is simple, reproducible and reliable.","Kumar, Prasoon; Sen, Ramesh Kumar; Aggarwal, Sameer; Jindal, Karan; Rajnish, Rajesh Kumar",J Clin Orthop Trauma,198,14

OBJECTIVES: To compare the Seeplex RV15 (test of record) with two newer generation multiplex assays, the Anyplex II RV16 and the xTAG respiratory virus panels. STUDY DESIGN: Two hundred and three retrospective and 36 prospective respiratory samples were tested by all three assays. Samples were deemed to be positive if they tested positive for a virus by at least two of the three respective assays. Negative samples also had to test negative by at least two of the three assays. Inconclusive samples were those that showed band signal intensity between 0 and 100 on the RV15, but had not been previously tested on the RV16 or xTAG. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Overall sensitivity and specificity of all three assays were similar (∼85% and 100%, respectively). Given each assay can identify multiple different viruses, the targets reported by one assay did not always agree with each target from another assay. Partial discordant rates were 47% and 21% for positive and negative samples, respectively. These higher than expected partial discordant rates may be due to primer or chemistry differences amongst the three multiplex assays.","Radko, Sandi; Ian Stuart, J.; Zahariadis, George",J Virol Methods,198,24

Utilization of the internet has increased dramatically over the last 10 years and in 2016, we added an online seminar. With the emergence of COVID-19 and new rules regarding social distancing, we are currently relying exclusively on web-based orientation. Research suggests there are racial and socioeconomic disparities in the utilization of internet health resources in the general population. To our knowledge this has not been studied in regard to the bariatric population. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed on patients who attended online (OS) and in-person seminars (IPS). Our primary endpoint was to compare the percentage of patients who underwent surgery. Secondary outcomes included differences in demographic and clinical characteristics between the patients who attended the OS versus the IPS. RESULTS: Of the 1152 patients who attended a bariatric orientation, 71.2% scheduled an office visit. The IPS patients had a higher rate of office visits and shorter time between orientation and first visit. Of patients eligible for surgery, there was a higher percentage of Caucasians in the OS group while the IPS group had higher rates of Hispanic and African Americans. Patients from the OS group had higher rates of marriage and employment, and lower rates of medical co-morbidities. When controlling for age, sex, race/ethnicity, marital status, employment status and medical co-morbidities, there was no significant impact of type of orientation on progression to surgery. CONCLUSION: We found that there was no difference in progression to surgery between the two orientation groups. Importantly, however, we detected marked demographic and clinical differences between the two patient populations. There is an urgent need to address these disparities as we are now heavily relying on patient outreach and education via the internet.

Here, we reflect on the immunological and epidemiological aspects and implications of pre-existing cross-reactive immune memory to SARS-CoV-2, which largely originates from previous exposure to circulating common cold coronaviruses. We propose four immunological scenarios for the impact of cross-reactive CD4(+) memory T cells on COVID-19 severity and viral transmission. For each scenario, we discuss its implications for the dynamics of herd immunity and on projections of the global impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the human population, and assess its plausibility. In sum, we argue that key potential impacts of cross-reactive T cell memory are already incorporated into epidemiological models based on data of transmission dynamics, particularly with regard to their implications for herd immunity. The implications of immunological processes on other aspects of SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology are worthy of future study.","Lipsitch, Marc; Grad, Yonatan H.; Sette, Alessandro; Crotty, Shane",Nat Rev Immunol,198,5

IBV infection was shown to induce cell cycle arrest at both S and G(2)/M phases for the enhancement of viral replication and progeny production. However, the underlying mechanisms are not well explored. In this study we show that activation of cellular DNA damage response is one of the mechanisms exploited by Coronavirus to induce cell cycle arrest. An ATR-dependent cellular DNA damage response was shown to be activated by IBV infection. Suppression of the ATR kinase activity by chemical inhibitors and siRNA-mediated knockdown of ATR reduced the IBV-induced ATR signaling and inhibited the replication of IBV. Furthermore, yeast two-hybrid screens and subsequent biochemical and functional studies demonstrated that interaction between Coronavirus nsp13 and DNA polymerase δ induced DNA replication stress in IBV-infected cells. These findings indicate that the ATR signaling activated by IBV replication contributes to the IBV-induced S-phase arrest and is required for efficient IBV replication and progeny production.","Xu, Ling Hui; Huang, Mei; Fang, Shou Guo; Liu, Ding Xiang",J Biol Chem,198,22

Novel forecasting tools and frameworks provide an arguable advantage to facilitate this adapting and adjusting process, by promoting efficient resource management at individual and institutional levels. Based on deterministic compartment models we propose an empirical top-down modeling approach to provide epidemic forecasts and risk calculations for (local) outbreaks. We use neural networks to develop leading indicators based on available data for different regions. These indicators are not only used to assess the risk of a (new) outbreak or to determine the effectiveness of a measure at an early stage, but also in parametric models to determine an effective forecast, along with the associated uncertainty. Based on initial results, we show the performance of such an approach and its robustness against inherent disturbances in epidemiological surveillance data. We foresee such a statistical framework to drive web-based automatic platforms to democratize the dissemination of prognosis results.","Uhlig, Steffen; Nichani, Kapil; Uhlig, Carsten; Simon, Kirsten",,198,21

This structural diversity supports a wide range of biological functions, allowing them to form mechanically rigid structures, provide levers for molecular motors, project domains across large distances, mediate oligomerization, transduce conformational changes and facilitate the transport of other molecules. Unlike almost any other protein fold known to us, their structure can be computed from parametric equations, making them an ideal model system for rational protein design. Here we outline the principles by which coiled coils are structured, review the determinants of their folding and stability, and present an overview of their diverse architectures.","Lupas, Andrei N.; Bassler, Jens; Dunin-Horkawicz, Stanislaw",Fibrous Proteins: Structures and Mechanisms,198,30

We also analyzed the effect of the individual and social factors on risky consumption during confinement. This longitudinal study involved a subsample of 303 adolescents aged 14–18 years, who were attending 4th year of compulsory secondary education (ESO), 2nd year of college preparation (baccalaureate), or Vocational and Educational Training (VET). We collected data before COVID-19 lockdown (October 2019–February 2020) and 2 months after the lockdown ended. We estimated the prevalence of risky substance use in the sample at baseline for each independent variable. We used Poisson regression models with robust variance to compute the Cumulative Incidence (CI) and Relative Risk (RR), with their respective 95% confidence interval. We found that VET students had a significantly (p < 0.05) higher risk of substance use: binge drinking (RR = 3.21 (95%CI: 1.00–10.34)); hazardous drinking of alcohol (RR = 3.75 (95%CI: 1.12–12.54)), hazardous consumption of cannabis (RR = 3.75 (95%CI: 0.65–21.59)) and daily smoking of tobacco (RR = 4.82 (95%CI: 1.74–13.39)). The results showed a general trend of reduction of consumption during COVID-19 confinement period. This study suggests that VET students were more likely to engage in hazardous drinking of alcohol and daily smoking of tobacco.

However, little has been said about oxidative stress status (OSS) of COVID-19 patients hospitalized in intensive care unit (ICU). Material and Methods: Biomarkers of the systemic OSS included antioxidants (9 assays), trace elements (3 assays), inflammation markers (4 assays) and oxidative damage to lipids (3 assays). Results: Blood samples were drawn after 9 (7–11) and 41 (39–43) days of ICU stay, respectively in 3 and 6 patients. Vitamin C, thiol proteins, reduced glutathione, γ-tocopherol, β-carotene and PAOT(®) score were significantly decreased compared to laboratory reference values. Selenium concentration was at the limit of the lower reference value. By contrast, the copper/zinc ratio (as a source of oxidative stress) was higher than reference values in 55% of patients while copper was significantly correlated with lipid peroxides (r = 0.95, p < 0.001). Inflammatory biomarkers (C-reactive protein and myeloperoxidase) were significantly increased when compared to normals.

Our aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of the evolution of interventions and self-protection measures, estimate the risk of partial lifting control measures and predict the epidemic trend of the virus in the mainland of China excluding Hubei province based on the published data and a novel mathematical model. METHODS: A novel COVID-19 transmission dynamic model incorporating the intervention measures implemented in China is proposed. COVID-19 daily data of the mainland of China excluding Hubei province, including the cumulative confirmed cases, the cumulative deaths, newly confirmed cases and the cumulative recovered cases between 20 January and 3 March 2020, were archived from the National Health Commission of China (NHCC). We parameterize the model by using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method and estimate the control reproduction number (R(c)), as well as the effective daily reproduction ratio- R(e)(t), of the disease transmission in the mainland of China excluding Hubei province. RESULTS: The estimation outcomes indicate that R(c) is 3.36 (95% CI: 3.20–3.64) and R(e)(t) has dropped below 1 since 31 January 2020, which implies that the containment strategies implemented by the Chinese government in the mainland of China are indeed effective and magnificently suppressed COVID-19 transmission. Moreover, our results show that relieving personal protection too early may lead to a prolonged disease transmission period and more people would be infected, and may even cause a second wave of epidemic or outbreaks. By calculating the effective reproduction ratio, we prove that the contact rate should be kept at least less than 30% of the normal level by April, 2020. CONCLUSIONS: To ensure the pandemic ending rapidly, it is necessary to maintain the current integrated restrict interventions and self-protection measures, including travel restriction, quarantine of entry, contact tracing followed by quarantine and isolation and reduction of contact, like wearing masks, keeping social distance, etc. People should be fully aware of the real-time epidemic situation and keep sufficient personal protection until April. If all the above conditions are met, the outbreak is expected to be ended by April in the mainland of China apart from Hubei province.","Wan, Hui; Cui, Jing-An; Yang, Guo-Jing",Infect Dis Poverty,198,17

The first period, the ‘social crisis,’ extended over thirteen weeks in late 2019 into early 2020 due to protests over income inequality and the government response to social unrest. The second period, the ‘health crisis,’ began in March 2020 with Chile’s first case of COVID-19 and escalated rapidly to include ‘stay at home orders,’ traffic restrictions, and the shuttering of most businesses. We wished to evaluate the impact of these crisis periods on trauma epidemiology. METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of the South-East Metropolitan Health Service Trauma Registry. Trauma admissions, operative volume, and in-hospital mortality were evaluated during the crisis period and the year prior. RESULTS: The social crisis saw increased levels of trauma, both blunt and penetrating, relative to the time period immediately preceding. The health crisis saw an increase in penetrating trauma with a concomitant decline in blunt trauma. Both crisis periods had decreased levels of trauma, overall, compared to the year prior. There were no statistically significant differences in in-hospital trauma mortality. CONCLUSION: Different crises may have different patterns of trauma. Crisis periods that include extended periods of lockdown and curfew may lead to increasing penetrating trauma volume.

The molecular underpinnings of immune recognition, host responses, and pathogenesis in this setting are poorly understood. We studied pandemic influenza viruses to determine the mechanism by which increasing glycosylation during evolution of surface proteins facilitates diminished pathogenicity in adapted viruses. ER stress during infection with poorly glycosylated pandemic strains activated the unfolded protein response, leading to inflammation, acute lung injury, and mortality. Seasonal strains or viruses engineered to mimic adapted viruses displaying excess glycans on the hemagglutinin did not cause ER stress, allowing preservation of the lungs and survival. We propose that ER stress resulting from recognition of non-adapted viruses is utilized to discriminate “non-self” at the level of protein processing and to activate immune responses, with unintended consequences on pathogenesis. Understanding this mechanism should improve strategies for treating acute lung injury from zoonotic viral infections.","Hrincius, Eike R.; Liedmann, Swantje; Finkelstein, David; Vogel, Peter; Gansebom, Shane; Samarasinghe, Amali E.; You, Dahui; Cormier, Stephania A.; McCullers, Jonathan A.",Cell Rep,198,1

The comparison of the qPCR and the ddPCR was based on a stimulation approach of microvascular endothelial cells in which the effect of a pro-inflammatory milieu on the expression of vasoactive receptors was investigated. RESULTS: There was consistency in directions of effects for the majority of genes tested. With regard to the indicated dimension of the effects, the overall picture was more differentiated. It was striking that deviations were more pronounced if the measured values were on the extreme edges of the dynamic range of the test procedures. CONCLUSIONS: To obtain valid and reliable results, dilution series are recommended, which should be carried out initially. In case of ddPCR the number of copies per µl should be adjusted to the low three-digit range. With regard to qPCR it is essential that the stability and reliability of the reference genes used is guaranteed. Here, ddPCR offers the advantage that housekeeping genes are not required. Furthermore, an absolute quantification of the sample can be easily performed by means of ddPCR. Before using ddPCR, however, care should be taken to optimize the experimental conditions.

Empirical evidence confirms that one cause is the lack of professional identity demonstrated by doctors. Medical professionals are required to maintain high standards of competence and moral responsibility, and demonstrate qualities such as respect, compassion, integrity, responsiveness to needs, and commitment to sound ethical practice in order to maintain professional privilege. These principles and appropriate professional conduct are the foundation of the professional identity of the medical profession. METHODS: A quantitative approach was adopted by distributing paper-based questionnaires to doctors and patients in two hospitals (Level III and Level II) in Jinan, Shandong province, China. FINDINGS: In total, 614 doctors and 1184 inpatients on discharge from the surgical and internal medicine units of the two hospitals participated in the survey yielding 90% response rates. The study confirmed the variation amongst doctors in demonstrating their professionalism in terms of respecting patients’ views and preferences when determining diagnostic procedures and treatment plans, and when making ethical decisions. Although 90% patients indicated that they showed respects to doctors, close to 20% of the doctors disagreed that they received high respect from patients. About 12% of doctors prescribed unnecessary diagnostic procedures to patient for the purpose of generating profit and more than 20% of patients indicated that they gave gifts to doctors in order to receive better treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Although about 80% of doctors demonstrated certain aspects of professionalism required by practitioners, the inconsistency across the medical workforce may exacerbate tense doctor-patient relationships. A review of medical curricula and focus of the internship program is required in order to assist medical graduates with forming required professional identity in order to improve patient satisfaction and better clinical outcomes.

In this situation, guidelines for health care professionals in endoscopy units with increased risk of infection from inhalation of airborne droplets, conjunctival contact and faeces are urgently needed. Recently, the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) and the German Society for Pneumology (DGP) issued recommendations. However, real-world data on the conditions and requirements of endoscopy units to adhere to this guidance are missing. Design: We conducted an internet-based survey among German endoscopy units from all levels of care from April 1st to 7th, 2020. The survey comprised 33 questions and was distributed electronically by the German Society of Gastroenterology, Digestive and Metabolic Diseases (DGVS) and the DGP. Results: In total, 656 endoscopy units completed the survey. Overall, 253 units (39%) cancelled fewer than 40% of their procedures. Of note, private practices cancelled less procedures than hospital-based units. Complete separation of high-risk and COVID-19 positive patients was achieved in only 20% of the units. Procedural measures were well adopted, with 91% of the units systematically identifying patients at risk and 85% using risk-adapted personal protective equipment (PPE). For the future, shortages in PPE (81%), staff (69%) and relevant financial losses (77%) were expected. Conclusion: Concise definitions of non-urgent, elective interventions and endoscopic surveillance strategies are needed to better guide endoscopic activity and intervention cancellations. In the short term, a lack of PPE can constitute considerable impairment of endoscopy units' operability and patient outcomes.","Garbe, J.; Eisenmann, S.; Heidemann, C.

Based on the current reports, hypertension may be associated with increased risk of sever condition in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was recently identified to functional receptor of SARS-CoV-2. Previous experimental data revealed ACE2 level was increased following treatment with ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). Currently doctors concern whether these commonly used renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockers-ACEIs/ARBs may increase the severity of COVID-19. Methods We extracted data regarding 50 hospitalized hypertension patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 in the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from Feb 7 to Mar 03, 2020. These patients were grouped into RAS blockers group (Group A, n=20) and non-RAS blockers group (Group B, n=30) according to the basic blood pressure medications. All patients continued to use pre-admission antihypertensive drugs. Clinical severity (symptoms, laboratory and chest CT findings, etc.), clinical course, and short time outcome were analyzed after hospital admission. Results Ten (50%) and seventeen (56.7%) of the Group A and Group B participants were males (P=0.643), and the average age was 52.65±13.12 and 67.77±12.84 years (P=0.000), respectively. The blood pressure of both groups was under effective control. There was no significant difference in clinical severity, clinical course and in-hospital mortality between Group A and Group B. Serum cardiac troponin I (cTnI) (P=0.03), and N-terminal (NT)-pro hormone BNP (NT-proBNP) (P=0.04) showed significant lower level in Group A than in Group B. But the patients with more than 0.04ng/mL or elevated NT-proBNP level had no statistical significance between the two groups. In patients over 65 years or under 65 years, cTnI or NT-proBNP level showed no difference between the two groups. Conclusions We observed there was no obvious difference in clinical characteristics between RAS blockers and non-RAS blockers groups.

In the present study, 3 duck PPARγ small interfering RNA (siRNA) expression plasmids were constructed to investigate the effect of downregulating the expression of PPARγ on adipogenesis and fat accumulation in ducks. The results indicate that the 3 siRNA specific for conserved regions of PPARγ can effectively inhibit expression of PPARγ. It was demonstrated that the expression of lipoprotein lipase and adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein in duck adipose tissue is repressed when the expression of PPARγ is downregulated by siRNA. At the same time, the weight of abdominal fat at 21 and 35 d of age is decreased significantly (P < 0.05) compared with the control. However, the triglyceride levels in serum and muscle are not affected when the mRNA of PPARγ is repressed.

We determined the interactions between nasopharyngeal microbial pathogens and commensals during viral upper respiratory tract infection (URI) and acute otitis media (AOM) in infants. METHODS: We analyzed 971 specimens collected monthly and during URI and AOM episodes from 139 infants. The 16S rRNA V4 gene regions were sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq platform. RESULTS: Among the high abundant genus-level nasopharyngeal microbiota were Moraxella, Haemophilus, and Streptococcus (3 otopathogen genera), Corynebacterium, Dolosigranulum, Staphylococcus, Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas, and Bifidobacterium. Bacterial diversity was lower in culture-positive samples for Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae, compared to cultured-negative samples. URI frequencies were positively associated with increasing trend in otopathogen colonization. AOM frequencies were associated with decreasing trend in Micrococcus colonization. During URI and AOM, there were increases in abundance of otopathogen genera and decreases in Pseudomonas, Myroides, Yersinia, and Sphingomonas. Otopathogen abundance was increased during symptomatic viral infection, but not during asymptomatic infection. The risk for AOM complicating URI was reduced by increased abundance of Staphylococcus and Sphingobium. CONCLUSION: Otopathogen genera played the key roles in URI and AOM occurrences. Staphylococcus counteracts otopathogens thus Staphylococcal colonization may be beneficial, rather than harmful. While Sphingobium may play a role in preventing AOM complicating URI, the commonly used probiotic Bifidobacterium did not play a significant role during URI or AOM. The role of less common commensals in counteracting the deleterious effects of otopathogens requires further studies.","Chonmaitree, Tasnee; Jennings, Kristofer; Golovko, Georgiy; Khanipov, Kamil; Pimenova, Maria; Patel, Janak A.; McCormick, David P.; Loeffelholz, Michael J.; Fofanov, Yuriy",PLoS One,198,1

A total of 57 Macao citizens were obligated to stay in Hubei province, China, where the highest COVID-19 prevalence was noted in the country and a “lockdown” policy was implemented for outbreak control for more than one month. They were escorted from Wuhan City to Macao via a chartered airplane organized by Macao SAR government and received quarantine for 14 days with none of the individual being diagnosed with COVID-19 by serial RNA tests from the nasopharyngeal specimens and sera antibodies. It was crucial to identify common characteristics among these 57 uninfected individuals. METHODS: A questionnaire survey was conducted to extract information such as behavior, change of habits and preventive measures.

METHODS: This study collected publicly available information on COVID-19 released on official channels (e.g., government websites and official media) by the Parehub tool. Also, the study used the Zhongyun Big Data Platform to search public datasets about released COVID-19 information on Chinese social media, such as TikTok and Weibo. An online survey was conducted via WeChat to Chinese citizens using a snowball sampling method. The questionnaire assessed changes in participants’ risk perception and action against COVID-19. The data analysis examined information content and release-time trajectories against the public’s risk perception and actions over time. RESULTS: Altogether, the collected data includes 1477 pieces of authorized information and 297,000 short videos on COVID-19. Of 1362 participants recruited from 33 provinces and municipalities of China, 1311 respondents (25–60 years, 42% male) were valid for future analysis. The study indicated that 85.7% of participants mainly relied on official channels to obtain information. Alongside the outbreak’s progress, there was a gradual rise in information quantity, publishing frequency, and content variation. Correspondingly, the public’s risk perception that “take it seriously” rose from 13 to 80%, 87.1% of those who took “multiple actions” compared to 25.9% initially. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicated that insufficient information freely-accessible at the early stages of the outbreak might lead to the lack of risk awareness and the public’s inadequate protective actions. Given the current global situation of COVID-19, the study highlights authorized, transparent, and timely two-way risk communication is vital to guide public perception and actions. Furthermore, our study provides risk communication recommendations and may contribute to developing full measures to address future crises.","Gong, Ni; Jin, Xiaoyuan; Liao, Jing; Li, Yundong; Zhang, Meifen; Cheng, Yu; Xu, Dong",BMC Public Health,198,16

This study examines time to first specialist outpatient visit following ED discharge for AFF. METHODS: Alberta residents aged ≥ 35 years with ED presentations for AFF ending in discharge during 2017-2018 were extracted and linked with hospitalizations and physician claims. A spatial scan and multinomial logistic regression were performed. Regression model predictors included demographics, prior diagnoses, and prior health service use. RESULTS: ED presentations for 4387 patients (54% male; mean age 68 years) were analyzed. Two geographic areas were identified as clusters that had longer times than would be expected by chance: a north cluster of northern areas with an estimated median time of 98 days (95% confidence interval [CI] 82,139), and an east cluster of eastern areas with a median of 57 days (95% CI 47, 68). Patients in the north cluster were more likely to be younger (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 0.76 per 5 years, 95% CI 0.62, 0.93) and have prior histories of AFF (aOR = 1.45, 95% CI 1.11, 1.90), congestive heart failure (aOR=1.51, 95% CI 1.15, 1.98), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (aOR = 2.03, 95% CI 1.55, 2.65), and diabetes (aOR = 1.30, 95% CI 1.00, 1.67).

Effective mass screening requires robust and sensitive tests that reliably detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus, including asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic infections with a low viral count. Currently, the most accurate tests are based on detection of viral RNA by RT-PCR. We developed a method to process COVID-19 specimens that simplifies and increases the sensitivity of viral RNA detection by direct RT-qPCR, performed without RNA purification. In the method, termed Alkaline-Glycol Processing (AG processing), a SARS-CoV-2-containing biological specimen, such as saliva or a swab-collected suspension, is processed at pH 12.2 to 12.8 for 5 min at room temperature. An aliquot of the AG-processed specimen is used for detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by direct RT-qPCR. AG processing effectively lyses viruses and reduces the effect of inhibitors of RT-PCR that are present in biological specimens. The sensitivity of detecting viral RNA using AG processing is on par with methods that include a viral RNA purification step. One copy of SARS-CoV-2 virus per reaction, equivalent to 300 copies per ml of saliva, is detectable in the AG-processed saliva. The LOD calculated following U.S. FDA guidelines is 600 viral copies per ml of initial saliva specimen. AG processing works with saliva specimens or swab specimens collected into Universal Transport Medium (UTM), is compatible with heat treatment, and was confirmed to work with a range of CDC-approved RT-qPCR products and kits. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA using AG processing with direct RT-qPCR provides a reliable and scalable diagnostic test for COVID-19 that can be integrated into a range of workflows, including automated settings.","Chomczynski, P.",,198,30

We investigated the effects of the differences in both emissions and regional and local meteorology in 2020 compared with the period 2015-2019. By adopting a globally consistent approach, this comprehensive observational analysis focuses on changes in air quality in and around cities across the globe for the following air pollutants PM2.5, PM10, PMC (coarse fraction of PM), NO2, SO2, NOx, CO, O3 and the total gaseous oxidant (OX = NO2 + O3) during the pre-lockdown, partial lockdown, full lockdown and two relaxation periods spanning from January to September 2020. The analysis is based on in situ ground-based air quality observations at over 540 traffic, background and rural stations, from 63 cities and covering 25 countries over seven geographical regions of the world. Anomalies in the air pollutant concentrations (increases or decreases during 2020 periods compared to equivalent 2015-2019 periods) were calculated and the possible effects of meteorological conditions were analysed by computing anomalies from ERA5 reanalyses and local observations for these periods. We observed a positive correlation between the reductions in NO2 and NOx concentrations and peoples' mobility for most cities. A correlation between PMC and mobility changes was also seen for some Asian and South American cities. A clear signal was not observed for other pollutants, suggesting that sources besides vehicular emissions also substantially contributed to the change in air quality. As a global and regional overview of the changes in ambient concentrations of key air quality species, we observed decreases of up to about 70% in mean NO2 and between 30% and 40% in mean PM2.5 concentrations over 2020 full lockdown compared to the same period in 2015-2019. However, PM2.5 exhibited complex signals, even within the same region, with increases in some Spanish cities, attributed mainly to the long-range transport of African dust and/or biomass burning (corroborated with the analysis of NO2/CO ratio). Some Chinese cities showed similar increases in PM2.5 during the lockdown periods, but in this case, it was likely due to secondary PM formation. Changes in O3 concentrations were highly heterogeneous, with no overall change or small increases (as in the case of Europe), and positive anomalies of 25% and 30% in East Asia and South America, respectively, with Colombia showing the largest positive anomaly of ~70%. The SO2 anomalies were negative for 2020 compared to 2015-2019 (between ~25 to 60%) for all regions. For CO, negative anomalies were observed for all regions with the largest decrease for South America of up to ~40%. The NO2/CO ratio indicated that specific sites (such as those in Spanish cities) were affected by biomass burning plumes, which outweighed the NO2 decrease due to the general reduction in mobility (ratio of ~60%). Analysis of the total oxidant (OX = NO2 + O3) showed that primary NO2 emissions at urban locations were greater than the O3 production, whereas at background sites, OX was mostly driven by the regional contributions rather than local NO2 and O3 concentrations. The present study clearly highlights the importance of meteorology and episodic contributions (e.g., from dust, domestic, agricultural biomass burning and crop fertilizing) when analysing air quality in and around cities even during large emissions reductions. There is still the need to better understand how the chemical responses of secondary pollutants to emission change under complex meteorological conditions, along with climate change and socio-economic drivers may affect future air quality. The implications for regional and global policies are also significant, as our study clearly indicates that PM2.5 concentrations would not likely meet the World Health Organization guidelines in many parts of the world, despite the drastic reductions in mobility. Consequently, revisions of air quality regulation (e.g., the Gothenburg Protocol) with more ambitious targets that are specific to the different regions of the world may well be required.","Sokhi, Ranjeet S; Singh, Vikas; Querol, Xavier; Finardi, Sandro; Targino, Admir Créso; Andrade, Maria de Fatima; Pavlovic, Radenko; Garland, Rebecca M; Massagué, Jordi; Kong, Shaofei; Baklanov, Alexander; Ren, Lu; Tarasova, Oksana; Carmichael, Greg; Peuch, Vincent-Henri; Anand, Vrinda; Arbilla, Graciela; Badali, Kaitlin; Beig, Gufran; Belalcazar, Luis Carlos; Bolignano, Andrea; Brimblecombe, Peter; Camacho, Patricia; Casallas, Alejandro; Charland, Jean-Pierre; Choi, Jason; Chourdakis, Eleftherios; Coll, Isabelle; Collins, Marty; Cyrys, Josef; da Silva, Cleyton Martins; Di Giosa, Alessandro Domenico; Di Leo, Anna; Ferro, Camilo; Gavidia-Calderon, Mario; Gayen, Amiya; Ginzburg, Alexander; Godefroy, Fabrice; Gonzalez, Yuri Alexandra; Guevara-Luna, Marco; Haque, Sk Mafizul; Havenga, Henno; Herod, Dennis; Hõrrak, Urmas; Hussein, Tareq; Ibarra, Sergio; Jaimes, Monica; Kaasik, Marko; Khaiwal, Ravindra; Kim, Jhoon",Environ Int,198,16

We report here that ACE2 is highly expressed in adult bone marrow, adipose tissue or umbilical cord‐derived MSC. On the other hand, placenta‐derived MSC express low levels of ACE2 but only in early passages of cultures. MSC derived from human embryonic stem cell (hESC) or human induced pluripotent stem cells (hIPSC) express also very low levels of ACE2. The transcriptome analysis of the MSCs with lowest expression of ACE2 in fetal‐like MSCs is found to be associated in particularly with an anti‐inflammatory signature.

The spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 is regarded as a key target for the development of vaccines and therapeutic antibodies. In order to develop anti-viral therapeutics for SARS-CoV-2, it is crucial to find amino acid pairs that strongly attract each other at the interface of the spike glycoprotein and the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) complex. In order to find hot spot residues, the strongly attracting amino acid pairs at the protein–protein interaction (PPI) interface, we introduce a reliable inter-residue interaction energy calculation method, FMO-DFTB3/D/PCM/3D-SPIEs. In addition to the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein/hACE2 complex, the hot spot residues of SARS-CoV-1 spike glycoprotein/hACE2 complex, SARS-CoV-1 spike glycoprotein/antibody complex, and HCoV-NL63 spike glycoprotein/hACE2 complex were obtained using the same FMO method. Following this, a 3D-SPIEs-based interaction map was constructed with hot spot residues for the hACE2/SARS-CoV-1 spike glycoprotein, hACE2/HCoV-NL63 spike glycoprotein, and hACE2/SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein complexes. Finally, the three 3D-SPIEs-based interaction maps were combined and analyzed to find the consensus hot spots among the three complexes. As a result of the analysis, two hot spots were identified between hACE2 and the three spike proteins. In particular, E37, K353, G354, and D355 of the hACE2 receptor strongly interact with the spike proteins of coronaviruses. The 3D-SPIEs-based map would provide valuable information to develop anti-viral therapeutics that inhibit PPIs between the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and hACE2.","Lim, Hocheol; Baek, Ayoung; Kim, Jongwan; Kim, Min Sung; Liu, Jiaxin; Nam, Ky-Youb; Yoon, JeongHyeok; No, Kyoung Tai",Sci Rep,198,22

The presence and detection of SARS-CoV-2 in human feces and its passage into the water bodies are significant public health challenges. Hence, the hot issue of WBE of SARS-CoV-2 in the coronavirus respiratory disease (COVID-19) pandemic is a matter of utmost importance (e.g., SARS-CoV-1). The present review discusses the background, state of the art, actual status, and prospects of WBE, as well as the detection and quantification protocols of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater. The SARS-CoV-2 detection studies have been performed in different water matrixes such as influent and effluent of wastewater treatment plants, suburban pumping stations, hospital wastewater, and sewer networks around the globe except for Antarctica. The findings revealed that all WBE studies were in accordance with clinical and epidemiological data, which correlates the presence of SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid (RNA) with the number of new daily positive cases officially reported. This last was confirmed via Reverse Transcriptase-quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR) testing which unfortunately is not suitable for real-time surveillance. In addition, WBE concept may act as a faster protocol to alert the public health authorities to take administrative orders (possible re-emerging infections) due to the impracticality of testing all citizens in a short time with limited diagnostic facilities. A comprehensive and integrated review covering all steps starting from sampling to molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater has been made to guide for the development well-defined and reliable protocols.","Mousazadeh, Milad; Ashoori, Razieh; Paital, Biswaranjan; Kabdaşlı, Işık; Frontistis, Zacharias; Hashemi, Marjan; Sandoval, Miguel A.; Sherchan, Samendra; Das, Kabita; Emamjomeh, Mohammad Mahdi",Pathogens,198,6

We show that the majority of amino acid positions, which differ between SARS-CoV-2 and the closely related SARS-CoV, are differentially conserved suggesting differences in biological behaviour. In agreement, novel cell culture models revealed differences between the tropism of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. Moreover, cellular ACE2 (SARS-CoV-2 receptor) and TMPRSS2 (enables virus entry via S protein cleavage) levels did not reliably indicate cell susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV further differed in their drug sensitivity profiles. Thus, only drug testing using SARS-CoV-2 reliably identifies therapy candidates. Therapeutic concentrations of the approved protease inhibitor aprotinin displayed anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. The efficacy of aprotinin and of remdesivir (currently under clinical investigation against SARS-CoV-2) were further enhanced by therapeutic concentrations of the proton pump inhibitor omeprazole (aprotinin 2.7-fold, remdesivir 10-fold). Hence, our study has also identified anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy candidates that can be readily tested in patients.","Bojkova, Denisa; McGreig, Jake E.; McLaughlin, Katie-May; Masterson, Stuart G.; Widera, Marek; Krähling, Verena; Ciesek, Sandra; Wass, Mark N.; Michaelis, Martin; Cinatl, Jindrich",bioRxiv,198,26

This study aims to identify the pharyngeal organisms present in a cohort of medical students with and without symptomatic pharyngitis. METHODS: This study was conducted between September 2016 and June 2018 at the College of Medicine and Health Sciences, UAE University, Al-Ain. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from preclinical and clinical medical students attending the college during the study period. The specimens were tested for 16 viral and nine bacterial pathogens using a real-time polymerase chain reaction assay. RESULTS: A total of 352 nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from 287 students; of these, 22 (7.7%) had pharyngitis symptoms. Overall, the most common isolates were human rhinovirus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, with no significant differences in terms of gender, year of study or stage of study. The prevalence of S. pyogenes in asymptomatic and symptomatic students was 1.1% and 0%, respectively. A Centor score of ≥2 was not associated with S. pyogenes-positive samples. Six pathogens were isolated from symptomatic students including H. influenzae. Fusobacterium necrophorum was not detected in any of the samples. CONCLUSION: The diagnosis and management of pharyngitis should be tailored to common pathogens in the region. This study found that S. pyogenes and F. necrophorum were not detected among students with symptoms of pharyngitis; moreover, Centor scores of ≥2 were not associated with the presence of S. pyogenes. This cut-off score therefore should not be employed as an empirical measure to initiate penicillin therapy in this population.","Narchi, Hassib; George, Junu V.; Al-Hamad, Sania M.; Robari, Fawaghi; Al-Teniji, Mariam; Chaqfa, Hussain; Alsuwaidi, Ahmed; Al-Mekhaini, Lolowa; Souid, Abdul-Kader",Sultan Qaboos Univ Med J,198,20

METHODS: We enrolled here 100 APD patients and 60 caregivers. Seventy-four patients were treated with device-aided therapies (DAT) and 26 with standard medical treatment (SMT). Through a telephonic interview, subjects underwent the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS-A; HADS-D), and an ad hoc questionnaire to explore thoughts and emotions related to the pandemic. RESULTS: Depression was observed in 35% of APD patients and anxiety in 39%, with a significant reduction of the latter after the lockdown (p= 0.023). We found a significant correlation between the type of therapy and the HADS-A score (p= 0.004). Patients’ main worries were as follows: a possible higher risk of COVID-19 infection (25%), interruption of non-pharmacological treatments (35%), interruption of outpatient clinics (38%), PD complications related to COVID-19 (47%). Patients treated with DAT manifested worries about device-related issues and risk for caregivers’ infection. The 40% of caregivers showed anxiety, while the 21.7% of them showed depression. CONCLUSION: Our study reveals a higher prevalence of anxiety and the presence of peculiar worries and needs in APD patients during the pandemic alongside psychological sequelae of their caregivers. These findings are important for neurologists and healthcare services to foster strategies for the management of psychological distress in both patients and caregivers.

It has been affecting the world from a health and economic perspective after its emergence since October 2019 at Wuhan province of China. Later on it became a pandemic, with aged people most affected. Surprisingly, the infants and children were not severely infected and mortality among them was reported infrequently. If they died it was due to some comorbidity or congenital heart problems. Why the rate of infection varies in different age groups around the world and what is the protective mechanism in children remains a mystery. Based on our neuropathological experience at the “Lino Rossi Research Center for the study and prevention of the unexpected perinatal death and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS)” of the University of Milan, Italy, we hypothesize that the decreased severity of the disease in infants compared to the elderly may be due to alteration at neurotransmitter levels especially of the Substance P (SP) and of the spinal trigeminal nucleus in the brainstem that is responsible for its secretion. This neurotransmitter may be directly related to the respiratory illness as is in COVID-19 infection. It is responsible for the increased inflammation and the characteristic symptoms associated with this disease. It is the main switch that must be urgently turned off using the NK-1R antagonist which is the receptor of SP and responsible for its functionality, especially in the elderly.","Mehboob, Riffat; Lavezzi, Anna Maria",J Neurol Sci,198,20
