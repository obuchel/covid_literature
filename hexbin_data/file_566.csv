Legionella pneumonia is a rare pathology among children,and even rarer when they are immuno-competent; a few cases have been reported in the literature. This is explained by the fact that infection occurs primarily to immuno-suppressed patients. Legionella bacteria are not systematicaly sought for in front of child's atypical pneumonia, contrary to Mycoplasma or Chlamydiae. In addition, a number of cases are probably not even noticed because either not serious (Pontiac fever), spontaneously cured, or cured with macrolides prescribed in the case of suspected pneumonia with Mycoplasma.","Akou'ou, M.H.; Oger, M.; Gras, G.; Eckart, P.; Penniello, M.J.; Vergnaud, M.; Guillois, B.",Arch Pediatr,566,1

A monovalent inactivated H1N1pdm09 vaccine was licensed in Brazil in 2014. However, there are concerns about its efficacy due to the limited vaccine cross-protection against heterologous viruses and the potential for exacerbated reactions against vaccine strains. Thus, monitoring SIAVs subtypes/lineages that are circulating in the Brazilian swine population is important, by applying a fast and efficient diagnostic test in herd field samples. A RT-PCR assay was developed, using primers specific for HA subtyping of Brazilian SIAV, and was used to evaluate the occurrence of subtypes from samples collected between 2012 and 2019. From 167 field samples positive for influenza A, 117 were subtyped by nested RT-PCR assay. A higher occurrence of H1N1pdm was observed from 2012 to 2015, H3N2 in 2017, and H1hu in 2017 to 2019. A hemagglutination inhibition test was performed in serum samples received from 2017 to 2019, confirming these data. The molecular data highlights the importance of H1hu and H3N2 detection since there are no vaccines available for the subtypes/lineages and raises an alert of H1hu for its potential to infect humans. Serological data suggest a cyclical profile of occurrence between the H3N2 and H1N1pdm over time. Monitoring SIAVs circulating in Brazilian swine herds is necessary, which provides the relevant information for field veterinarians to apply effective control measures on the properties.

25068,25068,25068,Kindergeneeskunde,15.615139,-0.06277233,2014,"Global food security and safety are threatened by a number of fast-occurring changes, even in the absence of natural disasters or terrorist attacks: overpopulation and urbanisation, environmental pollution, climate changes, intensive animal breeding, international trade and travel, emerging water- and food-borne diseases, antimicrobial-resistant bacteria, increasing food costs, complexity of food supply chains, malnutrition and risky food behaviour. Food safety management tools, including food legislation, national and international standards, quality management systems, risk analysis, risk-based inspections and controls, monitoring and alert systems for food contaminants and food-borne diseases, quantitative microbial risk assessment, nutrition and toxicology studies, and elaborate food processing technologies have brought to consumers in developed countries a wide selection of safe foods. Predictive and early warning and communication systems are being developed to increase the ability to “expect the unexpected” and take prevention measures before food hazards become real risks. The production, processing, transportation, storage and/or distribution stages of modern food supply chains remain exposed to various types of biological or chemical contaminants, as evidenced by recent events or crises. The prion/BSE, dioxin, acrylamide, melamine, bisphenol A cases, and the numerous pathogen outbreaks illustrate this exposure. The melamine story and the international traffic of counterfeited foods and drinks show that profit-motivated fraud and adulteration are rising threats, opening potential paths for terrorist actions. Recent food preservation, processing or packaging technologies and trends, in spite or because of their benefits (mild treatment, extended product shelf-life, “fresher” quality, RTE pre-cooked convenience) also bring safety risks at the consumer level: incomplete microbial inactivation, possible non respect of adequate storage conditions and expiration dates, undercooking, and generation of stress-resistant micro-organisms. Innovative technologies, such as the use of nanoparticules in foods or food contact materials, and the development of active, intelligent or sustainable food packaging entail uncertainties and safety concerns. Natural disasters, droughts, floods, conflicts, and poverty often lead to emergency situations requiring large assistance operations with complex logistics and specific meals ready-to-eat or nutrient-supplemented foods. Containerised food processing units that could be deployed and quickly set to operate in ­production-disrupted areas are being developed by the World Food Programme. Other strategies against food insecurity include insurance policies for crop failures and renting of agricultural lands abroad. Citizen perception of food safety risks and the EU consumers’ “right to informed choice” explain why some technologies elicit rejection: ionising irradiation of foods, hormonal and antibiotic treatment of animals, the use of various “­artificial” food additives, genetically modified crops and ingredients, cloned animals. Perceived benefits responding to consumers’ needs (healthier, more nutritive, higher quality, more convenient, lower cost), “naturalness”, respect of the environment and trusted information are the major factors influencing consumers’ acceptance of innovative food technologies and products. Novel foods and technologies are also subject to strict regulatory pre-market safety assessment and authorisation procedures. While necessary for protection against unexpected risks, some of these rules serve as barriers to innovation and trade, and fodder for strong political debates.","Cheftel, J.

The chronic infection is also dependent on the mouse strain used, with susceptibility linked in part to the D locus of the MHC. The region of the virus genome associated with neurovirulence maps to the P1 region, encoding the capsid proteins, and to the 5′ non-coding region. There is evidence that BeAnDA virus persists in oligodendrocytes, where it reactivates to initiate demyelinating disease. Host factors are involved in the development of the lesion, including CD4(+) T cell responses. These lymphocytes most probably mediate damage through activation of macrophages leading to local destruction of glial cells. Another possible pathological role for the immune system is the recognition of nerve cell antigens and the initiation of autoimmune disease. Such a virus-triggered phenomenon may well underlie human CNS diseases such as multiple sclerosis.","Nash, Anthony A.",,566,4

Therefore, we model an RNN-based query-biased summarizer to primarily include the overlapping words in the summary, using a copying mechanism. Experimental results, in terms of both automatic evaluation with ROUGE and manual evaluation, show that the strategy to include the overlapping words also works well for neural query-biased summarizers.","Ishigaki, Tatsuya; Huang, Hen-Hsen; Takamura, Hiroya; Chen, Hsin-Hsi; Okumura, Manabu",Advances in Information Retrieval,566,1

Activity is expected to rebound sharply in H2, but even so the severity of the shock is likely to lead to a permanent GDP loss for the global economy. ▀ While Chinese activity picked up in late‐Q1 as lockdown restrictions were unwound, we expect Q1 GDP to have fallen 12% q/q before rebounding sharply in Q2. But this Q2 boost looks set to be swamped by the collapse in activity caused by the rest of the world going into lockdown. ▀ Although shutdown restrictions elsewhere are less severe than those imposed in China, business survey and labour market data still point to sharp falls in activity in most countries in Q2. Quarterly GDP declines of 8% or more in the US and eurozone seem likely. Overall, world GDP could fall by about 7% in H1, roughly double the size of the contraction during start of the global financial crisis in 2009. ▀ In those economies subject to some form of lockdown, we expect restrictions to begin to be lifted during Q2. As a result, growth should resume in Q3 as sectors that have been forced to shut down see some pick‐up. But despite this rebound, world GDP is now seen shrinking 2.8% in 2020 overall — in 2009, the global GDP fall was 1.1%. ▀ The H2 pick‐up, followed by a return to more normal conditions next year, will result in world GDP growth rising to almost 6% in 2021, helped also by the recent collapse in oil prices to about $30pb. But the scale of the disruption means that we expect a permanent loss of output from the shock. We expect global GDP in the medium term to be some 1.5% below the level we had anticipated before the coronavirus outbreak. ▀ The risks around this forecast are large and broadly balanced. But were stringent lockdowns or widespread disruption, perhaps due to renewed outbreaks of the virus, to extend into Q3, global GDP could fall by as much as 8% this year.",,,566,4

These emotions can be managed by nursing empathy. There are different methods for improving empathy, but some evidence indicates a dramatic drop in nurses’ empathy. In this study, we aim to provide a protocol for investigating the effect of knowledge brokering on nurses’ empathy with patients receiving cardiac care. METHODS: This study protocol is developed based on SPIRIT checklist with an experimental design. The study population are nurses working in cardiac wards of three educational hospitals in western Iran, Khorramabad. The quota sampling method is used. The sample size is 100 individuals. The samples will be assigned to two intervention and comparison groups using stratified random allocation method. Permuted block randomization is used in each stratum. To prevent contamination between participants; firstly, the measurements of the comparison group is done. Knowledge brokering intervention is performed in 7 stages based on Dobbins’ knowledge translation framework 2009. Monica’s Empathy Construct Self-Rating Scale is used for measuring empathy. Statistical analyses are performed using SPSS (SPPS Inc. Chicago, Il, version 21). P value below 0.05 is considered as statistically significant. DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, there is no similar study using an experimental design to examine the efficacy of a knowledge brokering method to improve humanistic knowledge.

However, a subgroup of the overweight/obese population does not present metabolic abnormalities. Hence, there is an urgent need to identify biomarkers that can distinguish different obesity phenotypes and metabolic status. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 98 individuals were divided into three groups: metabolically healthy normal weight (MHNW), metabolically healthy obese (MHO), and metabolically unhealthy obese (MUO). Participants were evaluated for anthropometric and biochemical parameters and serum BMPR1A concentration and miR-503 level. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and logistic regression analysis were performed. RESULTS: The level of miR-503 was significantly higher in the MHO group compared with that in the MUO group, but no difference was observed between the MHNW and MHO groups. Meanwhile, no significant differences in serum BMPR1A concentration were observed between the three groups. ROC curve analysis showed that miR-503 could be used as a marker to distinguish the MUO from the MHO. Logistic regression analysis suggested that miR-503 was an important related factor associated with an unhealthy metabolic state in overweight/obese subjects. CONCLUSION: miR-503 can be considered as a suitable biomarker to distinguish between the MUO and MHO, which may be a related factor for the incidence of metabolic disorders in overweight/obese subjects.","Yue, Hai-Qing; Zhou, Ying-Hui; Guo, Yue; Tang, Chen-Yi; Wang, Fang; Zhou, Hou-De",Diabetes Metab Syndr Obes,566,4

INDICATIONS: Combination of clinically and radiologically observed parameters, such as pattern of thoracic injuries, grade of fracture dislocation, pathological changes to breathing biomechanics, and failure of nonsurgical treatment. CONTRAINDICATIONS: Acute hemodynamical instability and signs of systemic infection. SURGICAL TECHNIQUE: Detailed preoperative planning. Open, minimally invasive reduction and osteosynthesis using precontoured, low-profile locking plates and/or intramedullary splints. Careful reduction drilling/implantation of screws due to proximity of the pleura, lungs and pericardium. POSTOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT: Weaning from respirator as early as possible and early therapy of pneumothorax perioperatively. Removal of implants usually not necessary. RESULTS: In a retrospective study, 15 polytraumatized patients with flail chest benefitted from an early interdisciplinary surgical treatment strategy within 24–48 h. Early osteosynthesis after severe thoracic trauma significantly reduced ventilator dependency and lowered the risk of pneumonia compared to patients who underwent surgery at a later time point. Patients with severe thoracic injury and life-threatening polytrauma, who meet the indication criteria for open reduction and surgical stabilization of the thorax, are in need of a throughly planned and interdisciplinary synchronized priorization and strategy. Longer intensive care unit stay, overall prolonged duration of admission in hospital, and higher level of respirator-associated complication should be expected in patients with life-threatening severe thoracic trauma (Abbreviated Injury Score (AIS) ≥ 3) compared to patients without thoracic trauma.","Spering, Christopher; von Hammerstein-Equord, Alexander; Lehmann, Wolfgang; Dresing, Klaus",Oper Orthop Traumatol,566,1

This project implemented a ward round pro-forma across three wards of a tertiary hospital containing high risk COVID-19 patients, aiming to improve both documentation rates and subsequent ease in finding pertinent information. METHODS. Respiratory consultants determined 11 key parameters that should be documented daily for COVID-19 patients. Baseline objective data collection analysed all high-care ward round entries (n = 15), recording parameters as present or absent. Multidisciplinary team (MDT) opinions were collected via questionnaire. The pro-forma was trialled for two-weeks; repeated subjective and objective analysis was performed. All (n = 12) inpatient notes on the COVID-19 high-care ward were analysed. RESULTS/DISCUSSION. Pro-forma compliance was 100%. The mean number of key parameters documented per ward round entry increased by 80%, from 5 to 9. Eleven (100%) of the key parameters showed increased completion rates (fig.1). Junior doctor confidence increased 1-Likert point: ‘average’ to ‘confident’ (fig.2). 97% of respondents (n = 31) reported the pro forma saved time. Information finding and swab tracking both increased by 1-Likert point: ‘average’ to ‘easy’ (fig.2). From a medico-legal perspective, documentation of basic information (date, time) improved by 13%. This project shows not only a 60% increase in ceiling of care documentation, but also improved ease in accessing such information. CONCLUSION.

On admission, he was seen in respiratory distress and was eventually intubated and hooked to mechanical ventilation for acute respiratory failure brought about by COVID-19 pneumonia (confirmed by a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction of a nasopharyngeal swab on admission). He had an unremarkable head and neck examination; both of his calf muscles were hypertrophied. On neurological examination, he had mild proximal lower limb muscle weakness (power 4/5) and deep tendon reflexes were sluggish (+1). The patient was subsequently admitted into the intensive care unit. Laboratory data showed inflammatory markers associated with COVID-19 were elevated: Lactate Dehydrogenase (857 u/L; NV: 120-246 u/L) and Interleukin-6 (137 pg/mL; NV: 0-50 pg/mL).

Thyroid function tests were consistent with primary hypothyroidism from Hashimoto’s thyroiditis: TSH (22.6712 UIU/mL; NV: 0.35-4.94 UIU/mL), fT3 (<2.30 PMOL/L; NV: 2.89-4.88 PMOL/L), fT4 (<5.15 PMOL/L; NV: 9.01-19.05 PMOL/L), anti-Tg Ab (1810.3 IU/mL; NV: <50 IU/mL) and Anti-TPO Ab (2610.4 IU/mL; NV: <100 IU/mL). There was a consideration of Hoffman’s syndrome; muscle enzymes were noted to be elevated also: CK-Total (2589 U/L; NV: 55-170 U/L) and CK-MB (85.7 U/L; NV: 0-16 U/L). This is consistent with Hoffman’s syndrome. He was supposed to start hormone replacement therapy. However, he developed ileus (attributed to sepsis and hypothyroidism) which precluded the use of oral levothyroxine. To circumvent this roadblock, levothyroxine was given as an enema via the rectal route at 300 mcg once daily (approximately twice the oral dose). Upon initiation of hormone replacement, his sensorium, hemodynamic parameters, and bowel movement improved. Thus, we were able to shift to oral levothyroxine eventually. Unfortunately, he went into sudden cardiac arrest and expired after the 11th hospital day. Conclusion: COVID 19 infection could lead to exacerbations of pre-existing conditions such as Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis (in this case, manifesting with Hoffman’s syndrome). Hormone replacement is still the treatment of choice. Concomitant COVID 19 infection and treatment is not a contraindication to delay hormone replacement.

These bioactive compounds are essential for the advancement of biomedical industries. Four wild green paddy frogs, Hylarana erythraea, were collected from various habitat types within the Langkawi Archipelago. These frogs’ skin secretions were collected, extracted, and analysed for their protein compounds together with biomedical potentials using liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS). The total protein concentration of H. erythraea skin secretions was determined as 0.269 mg/mL. Based on the UniProt (Anura) database, we identified 29 proteins. These proteins were categorised as antimicrobial (AMP) (38%), followed by hormone (17%), enzyme (17%), unreviewed proteins (17%), structural proteins (7%), and regulatory proteins (4%). The AMPs identified were from the family of esculentin-1, esculentin-2, brevinin-1, and frenatin-4, while the hormones belonged to the cholecystokinin group. The enzymes detected were adenylate cyclase 9, the suppressor of tumorigenicity 14 protein homolog, and the HGF activator. The structural proteins belonged to toe pad keratin 2 and Krt5.7 proteins, while the single regulatory protein is CCR4-NOT transcription complex subunit 6-like.

This study tests whether explicit dehumanising language directed at Muslims is detected by tools of Facebook and Twitter; and further, whether the presence of explicit dehumanising terms is necessary to successfully dehumanise ‘the other’—in this case, Muslims. Answering both these questions in the negative, this analysis extracts universally useful analytical tools that could be used together to consistently and competently assess actors using dehumanisation as a measure, even where that dehumanisation is cumulative and grounded in discourse, rather than explicit language. The output of one prolific actor identified by researchers as an anti-Muslim hate organisation, and four (4) other anti-Muslim actors, are discursively analysed, and impacts considered through the comments they elicit. Whilst this study focuses on material gathered with respect to anti-Muslim discourses, the findings are relevant to a range of contexts where groups are dehumanised on the basis of race or other protected attribute.

In other types of hernia repair, use of mesh is associated with reduced recurrence rates. The aim of this study was to compare the use of mesh versus sutures alone for the repair of hiatal hernia in laparoscopic antireflux surgery. METHODS Patients undergoing laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication for GORD between January 2006 and December 2010 were allocated randomly to closure of the diaphragmatic hiatus with crural sutures or non-absorbable polytetrafluoroethylene mesh (CruraSoft®). The primary outcome was recurrence of hiatal hernia, as determined by barium swallow study 12 months after surgery. Secondary outcomes were: intraoperative and postoperative complications, use of antireflux medication, postoperative oesophageal acid exposure, quality of life, dysphagia and duration of hospital stay. RESULTS Some 77 patients were randomized to the suture technique and 82 patients underwent mesh repair. At 1 year, the hiatal hernia had recurred in six of 64 patients (9 per cent) in the mesh group and two of 64 (3 per cent) in the suture group (P = 0·144). Reflux symptoms, use of proton pump inhibitors and oesophageal acid exposure did not differ between the groups. At 3 years, recurrence rates were 13 and 10 per cent in the mesh and suture groups respectively (P = 0·692). Dysphagia scores decreased in both groups, but more patients had dysphagia for solid food after mesh closure (P = 0·013). Quality-of-life scores were comparable between the groups. CONCLUSION Tension-free crural repair with non-absorbable mesh does not reduce the incidence of recurrent hiatal hernia compared with use of sutures alone in patients undergoing laparoscopic fundoplication.

Thrombocytopenia in patients with COVID-19 has not been fully studied. OBJECTIVE To describe thrombocytopenia in patients with COVID-19. METHODS For each of 1476 consecutive patients with COVID-19 from Jinyintan Hospital, Wuhan, China, nadir platelet count during hospitalization was retrospectively collected and categorized into (0, 50], (50, 100], (100 - 150] or (150 - ) group after taking the unit (× 109/L ) away from the report of nadir platelet count. Nadir platelet counts and in-hospital mortality were analyzed. RESULTS Among all patients, 238 (16.1%) patients deceased and 306 (20.7%) had thrombocytopenia. Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older, were more likely to have thrombocytopenia and had lower nadir platelet counts. The in-hospital mortality was 92.1%, 61.2%, 17.5% and 4.7% for (0, 50], (50, 100], (100 - 150] and (150 - ) group, respectively. With (150 - ) as the reference, nadir platelet counts of (100 - 150], (50, 100] and (0, 50] group had a relative risk of 3.42 (95% CI 2.36 - 4.96), 9.99 (95% CI 7.16 - 13.94) and 13.68 (95% CI 9.89 - 18.92), respectively. CONCLUSIONS Thrombocytopenia is common in patients with COVID-19, and it is associated with increased risk of in-hospital mortality. The lower the platelet count is, the higher the mortality becomes.","Yang, Xiaobo; Yang, Qingyu; Wang, Yaxin; Wu, Yongran; Xu, Jiqian; Yu, Yuan; Shang, You",Journal of thrombosis and haemostasis : JTH,566,5

Seven different pre-packed CO2 canisters were tested in vitro: Amsorb Plus, Spherasorb, LoFloSorb, Medisorb, Medisorb EF, LithoLyme, and SpiraLith. CO2 (160 mL min(-1)) flowed into the tip of a 2 L breathing bag that was ventilated with a tidal volume of 500 mL, a respiratory rate of 10/min, and an I:E ratio of 1:1 using the controlled mechanical ventilation mode of the Aisys (®) (GE, Madison, WI, USA). In part I, canister life of each brand (all of the same lot) was tested with 12 different fresh gas flows (FGF) ranging from 0.25 to 4 L min(-1). In part II, canister life of six canisters each of two different lots of each brand were tested with a 350 mL min(-1) FGF. Canister life is presented as ""FCU"", fractional canister usage, the fraction of a canister used per hour, and is defined for the inspired CO2 concentration (FICO2) that denotes exhaustion. In part III, canister life per 100 g fresh granule content was calculated. FCU decreased linearly with increasing FGF. The relative position of the FCU-FGF curves of the different brands depends on the FICO2 threshold because the exhaustion rate (the rate of rise once FICO2 starts to increase) differs among the brands. Intra-lot variability was 18 % or less. The different prepacks can be ranked according their efficiency (least to most efficient) as follows: Amsorb Plus = Medisorb EF < LoFloSorb < Medisorb = Spherasorb = LithoLyme < SpiraLith (all for an FICO2 threshold = 0.5 %). Canister life per 100 g fresh granule content is almost twice as long when LiOH is used as the primary absorbent. The most important factors that determine canister life of prepacks in a circle breathing system are the chemical composition of the canister, the absolute amount of absorbent present in the canister, and the FICO2 replacement threshold. The use of the fractional canister usage allows cost comparisons among different prepacks. Results should not be extrapolated to prepacks that fit onto other anesthesia machines.","Hendrickx, Jan F A; De Ridder, Simon P A J; Dehouwer, Alexander; Carette, Rik; De Cooman, Sofie; De Wolf, Andre M",Journal of clinical monitoring and computing,566,1

Physical therapists were uniquely challenged during the pandemic, requiring a reassessment of techniques and strategies in order to best support patients. The purpose of this case report is to describe a musculoskeletal institution's experience with implementing telehealth physical therapy. METHODS (CASE DESCRIPTION) Previous telehealth experience enabled the infrastructure of a wide-scale adoption across institutions response to the Covid-19 pandemic. However, to fill in training gaps for HSS outpatient physical therapists, HSS Rehabilitation developed a robust education and implementation program. This training was influenced by clinician and patient surveys as well as the development of a published HSS Rehabilitation telehealth guide. Prior to performing telehealth physical therapist visits, clinicians were required to complete all training material to ensure comfortability and confidence. RESULTS The adoption of telehealth among clinicians was born out of necessaity, however the speed in which HSS rehabilitation pivoted was critical to avoid lapses in care. In a four week period after the NYC shelter in-place orders, 173 therapists were trained and performing virtual visits. HSS rehabilitation determined telehealth physical therapy had quicker access to care, similar patient satisifaction, and increase geographical outreach when compared to in-person care. CONCLUSIONS The tranisition to telehealth physical therapy included a multi-step process that provided clinician training, establishment of protocols and guidelines, and obtaining a better understanding of the patient experience. Telehealth physical therapy has shown early benefits such as improving patient access to care, and better continuity of care for patients traveling.

Therefore, we presumed that miR-222 might be implicated in regulating mitochondrial dysfunction induced by TGEV infection. To verify the hypothesis, the effect of miR-222 on mitochondrial dysfunction was tested and we showed that miR-222 attenuated TGEV-induced mitochondrial dysfunction. To investigate the underlying molecular mechanism of miR-222 in TGEV-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, a quantitative proteomic analysis of PK-15 cells that were transfected with miR-222 mimics and infected with TGEV was performed.

Despite current multidisciplinary treatments, there has not been a drastic change in overall prognosis within the last two decades. With current treatments, 60-70 % of patients with localized disease survive. Given a propensity of Wnt signaling to control multiple cellular processes, including proliferation, cell fate determination, and differentiation, it is a critical pathway in OS disease progression. At the same time, this pathway is extremely complex with vast arrays of cross-talk. Even though decades of research have linked the role of Wnt to tumorigenesis, there are still outstanding areas that remain poorly understood and even controversial. The canonical Wnt pathway functions to regulate the levels of the transcriptional co-activator β-catenin, which ultimately controls key developmental gene expressions. Given the central role of this mediator, inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin signaling has been investigated as a potential strategy for cancer control. In OS, several secreted protein families modulate the Wnt/β-catenin signaling, including secreted Frizzled-related proteins (sFRPs), Wnt inhibitory protein (WIF), Dickkopf proteins (DKK-1,2,3), sclerostin, and small molecules. This chapter focuses on our current understanding of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in OS, based on recent in vitro and in vivo data. Wnt activates noncanonical signaling pathways as well that are independent of β-catenin which will be discussed. In addition, stem cells and their association with Wnt/β-catenin are important factors to consider. Ultimately, the multiple canonical and noncanonical Wnt/β-catenin agonists and antagonists need to be further explored for potential targeted therapies.","Lin, Carol H; Ji, Tao; Chen, Cheng-Fong; Hoang, Bang H",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,566,27

High-throughput sequencing technologies generate enormous amounts of short fragments (reads) which essentially oversample components of a mixture; the representation redundancy enables reconstruction of the components (haplotypes, viral strains). The reconstruction problem, known to be NP-hard, boils down to grouping together reads originating from the same component in a mixture. Existing methods struggle to solve this problem with required level of accuracy and low runtimes; the problem is becoming increasingly more challenging as the number and length of the components increase. This paper proposes a read clustering method based on a convolutional auto-encoder designed to first project sequenced fragments to a low-dimensional space and then estimate the probability of the read origin using learned embedded features. The components are reconstructed by finding consensus sequences that agglomerate reads from the same origin. Mini-batch stochastic gradient descent and dimension reduction of reads allow the proposed method to efficiently deal with massive numbers of long reads. Experiments on simulated, semi-experimental and experimental data demonstrate the ability of the proposed method to accurately reconstruct haplotypes and viral quasispecies, often demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.","Ke, Ziqi; Vikalo, Haris",bioRxiv,566,1

Data consist of 14 entries submitted to the Corona Competition organized by the Supporting Foundation for Children and Youth with Disabilities. We ask how disabled young people narrate their lockdown experience. Our analysis focuses on the one hand on the hegemonic lockdown narratives and subject positions constructed with these and on narration of disability on the other. The findings highlight the variations in the narratives in relation to experiences of (mis)fitting. In many of the texts, lockdown is presented as not leading to changes in the narrator?s sense of self or experience of disability. A few stories make visible how the lockdown has even diminished dominance of disability experiences in narrator?s life. However, for some of the narrators, the lockdown has led to deepening sense of misfitting and amplified their experience of disability.","Mietola, Reetta Ahonen Karoliina",YOUNG,566,16

However, research shows that performance in such paradigms suffers from individual biases towards the frequency of gains to choose smaller local gains over larger longer term gain, also referred to as melioration. Here, we developed a simple two-choice reward task, implemented in 186 healthy human adult subjects across the adult lifespan to understand the behavioral, computational, and neural bases of payoff maximization versus melioration. The observed reward choice behavior on this task was best explained by a reinforcement learning model of differential future reward prediction. Simultaneously recorded and source-localized electroencephalography (EEG) showed that diminished theta-band activations in the right rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) correspond to greater reward payoff maximization, specifically during the presentation of cumulative reward information at the end of each task trial. Notably, these activations (greater rACC theta) predicted depressed mood symptoms, thereby showcasing a reward processing marker of potential clinical utility. Significance Statement This study presents cognitive, computational and neural (EEG-based) analyses of a rapid reward-based decision-making task. The research has the following three highlights. 1) It teases apart two core aspects of reward processing, i.e. long term expected value maximization versus immediate gain frequency melioration based choice behavior. 2) It models reinforcement learning based behavioral differences between individuals showing that observed performance is best explained by differential extents of reward prediction. 3) It investigates neural correlates in 186 healthy human subjects across the adult lifespan, revealing specific theta band cortical source activations in right rostral anterior cingulate as correlates for maximization that further predict depressed mood across subjects.","Balasubramani, Pragathi Priyadharsini; Diaz-Delgado, Juan; Grennan, Gillian; Alim, Fahad; Zafar-Khan, Mariam; Maric, Vojislav; Ramanathan, Dhakshin; Mishra, Jyoti",bioRxiv,566,12

Excluding the poly(A) tail, the genome comprises 6,927 nucleotides and contains three sequential open reading frames (ORFs). The first ORF (ORF 1a) contains a sequence encoding a serine protease motif, and the second ORF (ORF 1b) has a sequence encoding an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. ORF 1a may be linked to the second ORF by a ribosomal frameshifting mechanism. The third ORF (ORF 2) may encode the virion structural proteins as a polyprotein precursor. Two RNAs, probably genonic and subgenonic RNA (7.5 and 3.0 kb), were detected in the cytoplasm of ANV-infected cells. ANV and human astroviruses have the same genonic organization, and both are characterized by the presence of two RNA bands. The amino acid homologies of the products of ORF 1a, 1b, and 2 were 20.3, 41.9, and 25.8% to products of the corresponding ORFs of human astrovirus serotype 1 (A/88 Newcastle strain). We have constructed a genonic-length cDNA clone of ANV to test whether the in vitro transcript is infectious. When a chicken kidney cell culture was transfected with RNA transcribed in vitro and the cDNA clone, infectious virus was produced with cytopathic effects in the absence of trypsin. These observations suggested that the ANV (G-4260 strain) is a new genus of the family Astroviridae.","Imada, T; Yamaguchi, S; Mase, M; Tsukamoto, K; Kubo, M; Morooka, A",Journal of virology,566,19

The aim of this study was to analyze if a preoperative screening for COVID-19 was key to select optimal operative candidates and its impact on surgical outcomes. MATERIAL AND METHODS we present a retrospective analysis of all consecutive patients who underwent oncological high-risk and emergency urological surgeries in a Belgium tertiary center from March 30 to April 30, 2020. The screening protocol was based on clinical assessment and chest-CT to identify COVID-19-positive patients. RESULTS a total of 32 patients underwent elective oncologic (n = 17; 53 %) and emergency (n = 15; 47 %) operations. Screening by chest-CT revealed three cases of COVID-19 (9 %) having led to postpone two interventions. The third positive COVID-19 patient died of respiratory complications after bladder perforation urgent procedure. Two patients developed compatible post-operatively symptoms with one positive chest-CT but no positive RT-PCR and successful recovery. Adapted safety measures were followed to mitigate in-hospital transmission. CONCLUSION this report suggests feasibility and efficacy of systematic, preoperative screening for COVID-19 by chest computed tomography only. This strategy could allow to perform the majority of scheduled high-risk oncologic interventions safely for both the patients and the surgical staff.","Degraeve, A; Tilmans, G; Piraprez, M; Lejeune, S; Nicolas, H; Roumeguère, T",Revue medicale de Liege,566,28

Blocking CXCL10 signaling results in increased mortality accompanied by reduced T cell infiltration and increased viral titers within the brain suggesting that CXCL10 functions in host defense by attracting T cells into the CNS. The present study was undertaken to extend our understanding of the functional role of CXCL10 in response to MHV infection given that CXCL10 signaling has been implicated in coordinating both effector T cell generation and trafficking. We show that MHV infection of CXCL10(+/+) or CXCL10(-/-) mice results in comparable levels of T cell activation and similar numbers of virus-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Subsequent analysis revealed no differences in T cell proliferation, IFN-gamma secretion by virus-specific T cells, or CD8+ T cell cytolytic activity. Analysis of chemokine receptor expression on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells obtained from MHV-immunized CXCL10(+/+) and CXCL10(-/-) mice revealed comparable levels of CXCR3 and CCR5, which are capable of responding to ligands CXCL10 and CCL5, respectively. Adoptive transfer of splenocytes acquired from MHV-immunized CXCL10(-/-) mice into MHV-infected RAG1(-/-) mice resulted in T cell infiltration into the CNS, reduced viral burden, and demyelination comparable to RAG1(-/-) recipients of immune CXCL10(+/+) splenocytes. Collectively, these data imply that CXCL10 functions primarily as a T cell chemoattractant and does not significantly influence T cell effector response following MHV infection.","Stiles, Linda N; Hardison, Jenny L; Schaumburg, Chris S; Whitman, Lucia M; Lane, Thomas E",Journal of immunology,566,1

During the first outbreak, 1 adult dog and 2 eight-month-old puppies died. During the second outbreak, 2 ten-week-old puppies died. One puppy from the first outbreak and 2 puppies from the second outbreak were examined at necropsy. Histologically, all 3 puppies had severe segmental crypt necrosis of the small intestine and marked lymphoid follicle depletion in the spleen and Peyer's patches. Real-time (RT) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) demonstrated abundant canine parvovirus (CPV-2) DNA (Ct<15) in the affected small intestine, and immunohistochemistry detected large amounts of CPV-2 antigen in intestinal crypt epithelium and Kupffer cells but few positive macrophages in lymphoid organs. All puppies had marked sinusoidal histiocytosis and multifocal granulomatous inflammation in mesenteric lymph nodes and spleen, prompting additional RT-PCR testing for canine circovirus 1 (CaCV-1). Very high levels of CaCV-1 DNA (Ct<13) were detected in small intestine, lymph nodes, and spleen. In situ hybridization for CaCV-1 detected rare positive nuclei of regenerating crypt epithelium but abundant amounts of CaCV-1 nucleic acid in the cytoplasm and nuclei of histiocytes in all lymphoid tissues, including granulomatous inflammatory foci and hepatic Kupffer cells. Significant levels of CaCV-1 DNA were detected in blood and serum (Ct as low as 13) but not feces from 3 surviving dogs at 2 months or 1 year after the outbreak, respectively. We hypothesize that CPV-2 infection predisposed dogs to CaCV-1 infection and ultimately resulted in more severe clinical disease.","Thaiwong, T; Wise, A G; Maes, R K; Mullaney, T; Kiupel, M",Veterinary pathology,566,8

The assay was carried out with hyperimmune polyclonal nucleocapsid-specific antibodies from guinea pigs and rabbits immunized with recombinant His(6)-tagged SARS CoV nucleocapsid protein. The assay was used for the detection of SARS CoV nucleocapsid protein in nasopharyngeal aspirate, urine, and fecal samples collected from patients with confirmed SARS between days 2 and 33 after the onset of illness. The ELISA was capable of detecting this protein in SARS CoV cell culture lysates at 15 50% tissue culture infective doses/ml but did not produce positive signals when tested with cell culture lysates of human coronaviruses OC43 and 229E. When tested with 120 nasopharyngeal aspirate, 100 urine, and 100 fecal specimens from hospitalized patients without SARS, the assay was shown to have high specificities-96.7, 99, and 96%, respectively. In an evaluation of clinical specimens from SARS patients, 34 (52%) of 66 nasopharyngeal aspirate samples from 50 patients, 5 (5%) of 94 urine samples from 94 patients, and 36 (55%) of 65 fecal samples from 65 patients tested positive for SARS CoV nucleocapsid protein. Nucleocapsid protein could be detected from days 6 to 24 in nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens, from days 11 to 31 in urine specimens, and from days 8 to 32 in fecal specimens after the onset of illness. Moreover, the protein could be detected in 25 (83%) of 30 nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens obtained from days 11 to 15 and in all 7 fecal specimens obtained from days 21 to 32. Since the present ELISA is more convenient and economical than reverse transcription-PCR, it may serve as an alternative tool for the early diagnosis of SARS CoV infection in laboratories with limited resources and expertise and for mass screening for the reservoir of SARS CoV. Further studies on serial clinical specimens should reveal the duration of nucleocapsid protein shedding and may reveal a higher detection rate in SARS patients.","Lau, Susanna K P; Woo, Patrick C Y; Wong, Beatrice H L; Tsoi, Hoi-Wah; Woo, Gibson K S; Poon, Rosana W S; Chan, Kwok-Hung; Wei, William I; Peiris, J S Malik; Yuen, Kwok-Yung",Journal of clinical microbiology,566,1

This predictive task is challenging due to the novelty of the virus, limited data, and dynamic political and societal responses. We embed a Bayesian time series model and a random forest algorithm within an epidemiological compartmental model for empirically grounded COVID-19 predictions. The Bayesian case model fits a location-specific curve to the velocity (first derivative) of the log transformed cumulative case count, borrowing strength across geographic locations and incorporating prior information to obtain a posterior distribution for case trajectories. The compartmental model uses this distribution and predicts deaths using a random forest algorithm trained on COVID-19 data and population-level characteristics, yielding daily projections and interval estimates for cases and deaths in U.S. states. We evaluated the model by training it on progressively longer periods of the pandemic and computing its predictive accuracy over 21-day forecasts. The substantial variation in predicted trajectories and associated uncertainty between states is illustrated by comparing three unique locations: New York, Colorado, and West Virginia. The sophistication and accuracy of this COVID-19 model offer reliable predictions and uncertainty estimates for the current trajectory of the pandemic in the U.S. and provide a platform for future predictions as shifting political and societal responses alter its course.","Watson, Gregory L; Xiong, Di; Zhang, Lu; Zoller, Joseph A; Shamshoian, John; Sundin, Phillip; Bufford, Teresa; Rimoin, Anne W; Suchard, Marc A; Ramirez, Christina M",PLoS Comput Biol,566,1

However, several observational domains, including SNe within days or hours of explosion and faint, red transients, are just beginning to be explored. Here, we present the Young Supernova Experiment (YSE), a novel optical time-domain survey on the Pan-STARRS telescopes. Our survey is designed to obtain well-sampled $griz$ light curves for thousands of transient events up to $z \approx 0.2$. This large sample of transients with 4-band light curves will lay the foundation for the Vera C. Rubin Observatory and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, providing a critical training set in similar filters and a well-calibrated low-redshift anchor of cosmologically useful SNe Ia to benefit dark energy science. As the name suggests, YSE complements and extends other ongoing time-domain surveys by discovering fast-rising SNe within a few hours to days of explosion. YSE is the only current four-band time-domain survey and is able to discover transients as faint $\sim$21.5 mag in $gri$ and $\sim$20.5 mag in $z$, depths that allow us to probe the earliest epochs of stellar explosions. YSE is currently observing approximately 750 square degrees of sky every three days and we plan to increase the area to 1500 square degrees in the near future. When operating at full capacity, survey simulations show that YSE will find $\sim$5000 new SNe per year and at least two SNe within three days of explosion per month. To date, YSE has discovered or observed 8.3% of the transient candidates reported to the International Astronomical Union in 2020. We present an overview of YSE, including science goals, survey characteristics and a summary of our transient discoveries to date.","Jones, D. O.; Foley, R. J.; Narayan, G.; Hjorth, J.; Huber, M.

Nearly 2 decades of clinical research on telepsychotherapy treatments with children with neurological conditions has the potential to inform emerging clinical practice in the age of COVID-19. Toward that end, we synthesized findings from 14 clinical trials of telepsychotherapy problem-solving and parent-training interventions involving more than 800 children and families with diverse diagnoses, including traumatic brain injury, epilepsy, brain tumors, congenital heart disease, and perinatal stroke. We summarize efficacy across studies and clinical populations and report feasibility and acceptability data from the perspectives of parents, children, and psychotherapists. We describe adaptation for international contexts and strategies for troubleshooting technological challenges and working with families of varying socioeconomic strata. The extensive research literature reviewed and synthesized provides considerable support for the utility of telepsychotherapy with children with neurological conditions and their families and underscores its high level of acceptability with both diverse clinical populations and providers. During this period of heightened vulnerability and stress and reduced access to usual supports and services, telepsychotherapy approaches such as online family problem-solving treatment and online parenting skills training may allow psychologists to deliver traditional evidence-based treatments virtually while preserving fidelity and efficacy.","Wade, Shari L.; Gies, Lisa M.; Fisher, Allison P.; Moscato, Emily L.; Adlam, Anna R.; Bardoni, Alessandra; Corti, Claudia; Limond, Jennifer; Modi, Avani C.; Williams, Tricia",J.

Using quantum dots (QDs) in the absorber region of the SESAMs instead of quantum wells, enables additional degrees of freedom in the design, the control of saturation parameters and the recovery dynamics. However, if one wants to integrate such a SESAM element into semiconductor surface emitting lasers such as a mode-locked integrated external-cavity surface-emitting laser (MIXSEL), the saturable absorber layers have to withstand a longer high-temperature growth procedure for the epitaxial formation of distributed Bragg reflectors (DBR). Typically defect related SESAMs will be annealed at those growth temperatures and lose their high-speed performance. Here we present a systematic study on the growth parameters and post-growth annealing of SESAMs based on high-quality InxGa1-xAs/GaAs quantum dots (QDs) grown by MBE at growth temperatures of 450 °C or higher. The good quality enables the QDs to survive the long DBR overgrowth at 600 °C with only minimal shifts in the designed operation wavelength of 1030 nm required for growth of MIXSEL devices. The introduction of recombination centers with p-type modulation doping and additional post-growth annealing improves the absorption of the high-quality QDs. Hence, low saturation fluences < 10 µJ/cm2 and a reduction of the &#964;1/e recovery time to values < 2 ps can be achieved.","Finke, T; Nürnberg, J; Sichkovskyi, V; Golling, M; Keller, U; Reithmaier, J P",Opt Express,566,1

Diagnostic tests for covid-19 fall into two main categories: molecular tests that detect viral RNA, and serological tests that detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulins. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), a molecular test, has become the gold standard for diagnosis of covid-19; however, this test has many limitations that include potential false negative results, changes in diagnostic accuracy over the disease course, and precarious availability of test materials. Serological tests have generated substantial interest as an alternative or complement to RT-PCR and other Nucleic acid tests in the diagnosis of acute infection, as some might be cheaper and easier to implement at the point of care. A clear advantage of these tests over RT-PCR is that they can identify individuals previously infected by SARS-CoV-2, even if they never underwent testing while acutely ill. Many serological tests for covid-19 have become available in a short period, including some marketed for use as rapid, point-of-care tests. The pace of development has, however, exceeded that of rigorous evaluation, and important uncertainty about test accuracy remains.","Sidiq, Zeeshan; Hanif, M; Dwivedi, Kaushal Kumar; Chopra, K K",Indian J Tuberc,566,26

This loss affected millions of young children, including many of the 4.6 million low-income children who are provided free meals and snacks by their ECE programs through support from the federal Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP).Although Congress swiftly authorized waivers that would allow CACFP-participating ECE programs to continue distributing food to children, early evidence suggests that most ECE programs did not have the capacity to do so, leaving a fragmented system of federal, state, and local food programs to fill the gaps created by this loss.Critical steps are needed to repair our nation's fragile ECE system, including greater investment in CACFP, to ensure the nutrition, health, and development of young children during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.

The present study consisted of 150 patients, including 91 volunteering women and 59 men, admitting to our dermatology clinic with any dermatological symptoms. The presence of symptoms, such as itching, rash, drying and peeling, discomfort, redness, burning, pain, swelling, acne, oily skin symptoms because of mask use, and previous history of facial dermatological disease, whether this disease increased with the use of mask, were questioned. The diagnosis made after dermatological examination and the dermatological examination findings were evaluated with the results of the survey. The most common finding in all patients after mask use was itching with a rate of 64.7%. Similar rates were detected for other symptoms. A significant increase was detected in the severity of acneiform and inflammatory dermatosis after the use of masks (P < .05). Our study showed that long-term mask use caused primary skin symptoms, such as itching, redness, rash, dryness and peeling, burning, oily skin, and acne formation in individuals who have dermatological diseases, and also increased the existing dermatological facial diseases. Therefore, it should be recommended to use water-based moisturizers as it may have a barrier effect on the faces of individuals who use a face mask and have any facial dermatosis, and patients should be closely monitored for skin diseases on the face.","Inan Dogan, Esra; Kaya, Ferit",Dermatol Ther,566,16

METHODS: A comprehensive electronic search was done through PubMed, Scopus, Medline, Cochrane database, and Google Scholar from December 01, 2019, to May 22, 2020, along with the reference list of all included studies. All cohort studies that reported on outcomes of COVID-19 during pregnancy were included. Qualitative assessment of included studies was performed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. RESULTS: Upon admission, most pregnant women underwent a low-dose radiation CT scan; the reports of which included unilateral/bilateral pneumonia in most patients. A marked lymphopenia was also noted in many patients with COVID-19. 513 titles were screened, and 22 studies were included, which identified 156 pregnant women with COVID-19 and 108 neonatal outcomes. The most common maternal/foetal complications included intrauterine/foetal distress (14%) and premature rupture of membranes (8%). The neonatal clinical manifestations of COVID-19 commonly included shortness of breath (6%), gastrointestinal symptoms (4%), and fever (3%). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 infection in pregnancy leads to increased risk in pregnancy complications such as preterm birth, PPROM, and may possibly lead to maternal death in rare cases. There is no evidence to support vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection to the unborn child. Due to a paucity of inconsistent data regarding the impact of COVID-19 on the newborn, caution should be undertaken to further investigate and monitor possible infection in the neonates born to COVID-19-infected mothers.","Akhtar, Hubba; Patel, Chandni; Abuelgasim, Eyad; Harky, Amer",Gynecol Obstet Invest,566,6

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional observational study was conducted at Altamash Institute of Dental Medicine, Karachi from June 2020 to August 2020. A total of 775 patients participated to fill questionnaire. After scrutiny, 25 questionnaire forms were excluded due to incomplete information. Questionnaire was divided in to four sections. First section obtained patients sociodemographic information, while knowledge of patients regarding cross-infection control during COVID-19 pandemic was evaluated in second section. Similarly, the purpose of third section was to assess attitude and fourth section was designed to evaluate practice. Likert's 3-point scale was used for registration of participant's response. The reliability of questionnaire was assessed through Crohnbach's &#945; (&#945; = 0.74). Statistical analysis was performed after entering data in to SPSS version 25. Independent t-test was used to evaluate the difference in patients' knowledge, attitude, and practice. A p-value &#8804; 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. RESULTS: Majority of the participants agreed that COVID-19 is a highly contagious disease (631, 97%) and daily screening of staff, dental assistants, dentists, and patients is necessary (568, 75.7%) along with proper sterilization of instruments and disinfection of dental operatory (650, 86.66%). A large number of participant also agreed that proper disposal of waste is utmost important for cross-infection control (601, 80.24%) and patient's waiting area should also be marked with social distancing sign (620, 82.66%). However, when asked about the common route of COVID-19 transmission in dentistry, 341 (45.5%) participants disagreed that it is not through aerosol (water droplets) generated during dental procedures. CONCLUSIONS: Dental health professionals should take additional measures to educate dental patients on mechanism of potential spread of COVID-19 through the aerosols and droplets generated during dental procedures. They should also encourage the dental patients to be vigilant and question the cross-infection control measures practiced by the dentist to whom they go for dental treatment, and to decrease their chances of acquiring an infection during their visit to the dental office.","Ahmed, Muhammad Adeel; Jouhar, Rizwan; Adnan, Samira; Ahmed, Naseer; Ghazal, Tuba; Adanir, Necdet",European journal of dentistry,566,31

OBJECTIVE: The goal of the present study was to better understand the scope and characteristics of rapid return, and to provide data-informed recommendations for service providers working with this population. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Representatives from 67 non-government organizations (NGOs) providing residential care that were government-mandated to rapidly return children and youth to family completed a brief online survey. They collectively serve 12,494 children in 14 nations. METHODS: Using a mixed methods design, results examined 1) characteristics of the rapid return mandate, 2) preparation received by children and families, 3) support services provided since the return, and 4) primary concerns for children and families. RESULTS: Data revealed that rapid return was characterized by compressed timelines that did not allow for adequate child and family assessment and preparation. However, all respondents indicated they believed at least some families would be able to remain intact safely with appropriate support. Primary concerns for children and families related to unresolved antecedents to separation, lack of economic capacity, limited monitoring, and lack of access to education. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the findings, 9 recommendations were made for service providers working with children and families that have been rapidly reunified as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Wilke, Nicole Gilbertson; Howard, Amanda Hiles; Goldman, Philip",Child Abuse Negl,566,21

Objective: To determine whether mandatory daily employee symptom attestation data can be used as syndromic surveillance to estimate COVID-19 hospitalizations in the communities where employees live. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study was conducted from April 2, 2020, to November 4, 2020, at a large academic hospital network of 10 hospitals accounting for a total of 2384 beds and 136â¯000 discharges in New England. The participants included 6841 employees who worked on-site at hospital 1 and lived in the 10 hospitals' service areas. Exposure: Daily employee self-reported symptoms were collected using an automated text messaging system from a single hospital. Main Outcomes and Measures: Mean absolute error (MAE) and weighted mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 7-day forecasts of daily COVID-19 hospital census at each hospital. Results: Among 6841 employees living within the 10 hospitals' service areas, 5120 (74.8%) were female individuals and 3884 (56.8%) were White individuals; the mean (SD) age was 40.8 (13.6) years, and the mean (SD) time of service was 8.8 (10.4) years. The study model had a MAE of 6.9 patients with COVID-19 and a weighted MAPE of 1.5% for hospitalizations for the entire hospital network. The individual hospitals had an MAE that ranged from 0.9 to 4.5 patients (weighted MAPE ranged from 2.1% to 16.1%). For context, the mean network all-cause occupancy was 1286 during this period, so an error of 6.9 is only 0.5% of the network mean occupancy. Operationally, this level of error was negligible to the incident command center. At hospital 1, a doubling of the number of employees reporting symptoms (which corresponded to 4 additional employees reporting symptoms at the mean for hospital 1) was associated with a 5% increase in COVID-19 hospitalizations at hospital 1 in 7 days (regression coefficient, 0.05; 95% CI, 0.02-0.07; P < .001). Conclusions and Relevance: This cohort study found that a real-time employee health attestation tool used at a single hospital could be used to estimate subsequent hospitalizations in 7 days at hospitals throughout a larger hospital network in New England.","Horng, Steven; O039,; Donoghue, Ashley; Dechen, Tenzin; Rabesa, Matthew; Shammout, Ayad; Markson, Lawrence; Jegadeesan, Venkat; Tandon, Manu; Stevens, Jennifer P",JAMA Netw Open,566,1

This study finds out how the 23 anglophone Sub-Saharan African countries' national health ministries and infectious disease agencies disseminated COVID-19 related information through their social media accounts within the first three months after the declaration of COVID-19 as a pandemic by the World Health Organization. COVID-19 related qualitative and quantitative data types were collected from the social media accounts of the surveyed national health ministries and agencies for analysis. Over 86% of the African countries had presence on social media;Facebook was the most popular, though Twitter contained more posts. One of the credibility issues that was noticed is that most of the health ministries' and agencies' social media accounts were unverified and access to the social media accounts was not provided on most of their official websites. Information dissemination became more deliberate and increased significantly after the announcement of the fist cases of COVID-19 in the countries under review. Awareness creation, updates and news constituted the major categories of information that were disseminated, mostly in the form of derivative social media information before the announcement of the first COVID-19 case in the surveyed African countries. Campaigns against misinformation were barely undertaken by most of the countries. Strategies used by some countries included the employment of social media influencers and creation of content in local languages. Strategies that include development of health information content that targets different groups in African societies and the inclusion of elderly in the community and religious leaders as non-state actors in health information communication were recommended. © 2021 De Gruyter Saur.

The University of British Columbia (UBC) MD Undergraduate Program (MDUP) is the sixth largest medical school in North America. MDUP students and faculty developed a joint response to these disruptions to address the curriculum and public health challenges that the pandemic posed. After clinical activities were suspended in March 2020, third- and fourth-year MDUP students formed a COVID-19 Medical Student Response Team (MSRT) to support frontline physicians, public health agencies, and community members affected by the pandemic. A nimble organizational structure was developed across 4 UBC campuses to ensure a rapid response to meet physician and community needs. Support from the faculty ensured the activities were safe for the public, patients, and students and facilitated the provision of curricular credit for volunteer activities meeting academic criteria. As of June 19, 2020, more than 700 medical students had signed up to participate in 68 projects. The majority of students participated in projects supporting the health care system, including performing contact tracing, staffing public COVID-19 call centers, distributing personal protective equipment, and creating educational multimedia products. Many initiatives have been integrated into the MDUP curriculum as scholarly activities or paraclinical electives for which academic credit is awarded. This was made possible by the inherent flexibility of the MDUP curriculum and a strong existing partnership between students and faculty. Through this process, medical students were able to develop fundamental leadership, advocacy, communication, and collaboration skills, essential competencies for graduating physicians. In developing a transparent, accountable, and inclusive organization, students were able to effectively meet community needs during a crisis and create a sustainable and democratic structure capable of responding to future emergencies. Open dialogue between the MSRT and the faculty allowed for collaborative problem solving and the opportunity to transform disruption into academic innovation.","Tsang, Vivian W L; Yu, Alec; Haines, Morgan J; Sagorin, Zach; Mitchell, Devon; Ching, Geoffrey; Holmes, Cheryl L; Kestler, Mary",Acad. med,566,1

We assessed the association of symptom status and medical comorbidities on mortality and hospitalization risk associated with COVID-19 in residents across 15 nursing homes in Maryland. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: 1970 residents from 15 nursing home facilities with universal COVID-19 testing in Maryland. METHODS: We used descriptive statistics to compare baseline characteristics, logistic regression to assess the association of comorbidities with COVID-19, and Cox regression to assess the association of asymptomatic and symptomatic COVID-19 with mortality and hospitalization. We assessed the association of comorbidities with mortality and hospitalization risk. Symptom status was assessed at the time of the first test. Maximum follow-up was 94 days. RESULTS: Among the 1970 residents (mean age 73.8, 57% female, 68% black), 752 (38.2%) were positive on their first test. Residents who were positive for COVID-19 and had multiple symptoms at the time of testing had the highest risk of mortality [hazard ratio (HR) 4.44, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.97, 6.65) and hospitalization (subhazard ratio 2.38, 95% CI 1.70, 3.33), even after accounting for comorbidity burden. Cases who were asymptomatic at testing had a higher risk of mortality (HR 2.92, 95% CI 1.95, 4.35) but not hospitalization (HR 1.06, 95% CI 0.82, 1.38) compared with those who were negative for COVID-19. Of 52 SARS-CoV-2-positive residents who were asymptomatic at the time of testing and were closely monitored for 14 days at one facility, only 6 (11.6%) developed symptoms. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Asymptomatic infection with SARS-CoV-2 in the nursing home setting was associated with increased risk of death, suggesting a need for closer monitoring of these residents, particularly those with underlying cardiovascular and respiratory comorbidities.","Tang, Olive; Bigelow, Benjamin F; Sheikh, Fatima; Peters, Matthew; Zenilman, Jonathan M; Bennett, Richard; Katz, Morgan J",J Am Med Dir Assoc,566,1

The first objective is to examine the mediating roles of spatial presence and co-presence in the relationship between technology enabled co-creation and service experience. The second objective is to investigate if healthcare service experience impacts patients' relationship value with hospitals and subsequent patronage intention. Design/methodology/approach Data were collected from a sample of 516 customers of three leading hospitals in India during the social isolation period of COVID-19. The data were analysed using structural equation modelling. Findings The study results demonstrate that customers' favourably perceived technology-enabled co-creation generates feelings of spatial presence and co-presence in the technology-enabled platform. The feeling of presence enhances patients' health care service experiences which in turn predict their relationship value perceptions towards the healthcare service provider. Co-presence dominates as a mediator in terms of magnitude over spatial presence. The favourable value perception positively impacts patients' intention to come back to the same hospital. Research limitations/implications The study uses cross-sectional data, which does not incorporate any temporal variations in the investigated relationships. The study does not account for differences in government vs. private undertakings of healthcare system. Practical implications The findings envisage a digital healthcare retail system, where hospitals can enhance patients' perceptions of healthcare service experience, relational value and re-patronage intention, based on the digital mediated environment design elements, i.e. spatial presence and co-presence. As co-presence is a dominant factor, ensuring that human healthcare experts (rather than technology based e-service elements like chatbots) participate in healthcare service co-creation is of prime importance to provide enriching service experience to the patients.

But, hidden variables and their interrelationships also have a significant effect on the spread of a pandemic. Multinomial logistic regression, odds ratio, linear mixed-effect models, and principal component analysis are used here to analyze these hidden variables and their interrelationships. Also, such studies are very important for countries with limited and scarce data. These countries do not have a backbone of good-quality official records. Understanding the spread of a disease in a developing country also helps in management and eradication of that disease. The multivariate daily data of new cases, deaths, recovered, total cases, total deaths, total recovered, and total infected (isolated) are used here. The daily incidence of new cases is also modeled here using nonlinear regression. Two best nonlinear models are discussed here. ARIMA models are used for analyzing and forecasting the progression of the variables for two months into the future. The impact of government restriction in the form of strict lockdown 1, partially relaxed lockdown 1, completely relaxed lockdown 1, and strict lockdown 2 is minutely analyzed. These controls were exercised to curtail the spread of the pandemic. The role of these controls in curbing the spread of the pandemic is also studied here.

Quel en a été l’impact sur le dépistage et les nouveaux cas d’infections par le VIH dans notre centre ? Matériels et méthodes Les données ont été recueillies à partir des Déclarations Obligatoires d’infection par le VIH faites par le laboratoire de virologie d’un hôpital du Nord de Paris et à partir de la base NADIS® du 01/01/2019 au 31/12/2020. Le nombre de demandes de dépistage du VIH, l’incidence annuelle, semestrielle, ainsi que les caractéristiques des patients ont été comparés entre 2019 et 2020. Résultats Le nombre total de dépistages VIH était égal à 6539 en 2019 versus (vs) 5141 en 2020, soit une réduction de 21 %. Les prescriptions au CeGIDD représentent la plus forte diminution (34 %) sur notre site, passant de 4351 en 2019 à 2882 en 2020. Le nombre total de nouveaux patients diagnostiqués VIH positifs était de 212 en 2019 et 103 en 2020, soit une réduction de 52 %. Le pourcentage de patients séropositifs sur le nombre total de dépistages était de 212/6539 (3,24 %) en 2019 vs 103/5141 (2,0 %) en 2020 (p&lt;0,001). L’analyse par semestre montre que le pourcentage de patients nouvellement diagnostiqués au cours du premier semestre était de 127/212 (60 %) en 2019 vs 48/103 (47 %) en 2020 (p&lt;0,05). Les caractéristiques de ces patients n’étaient pas significativement différentes entre les 2 années: sexe ratio homme/femme de 2,48 en 2019 vs 2,16 en 2020, âge médian de 36 ans [17-73] en 2019 vs 35 ans [21-81] en 2020, pourcentage de patients avec des CD4&lt;500 mm3 de 75 % (159/212) en 2019 vs 73 % (75/103) en 2020, délai de mise sous traitement inférieur à 1 semaine de 17 % (37/212) en 2019 vs 22 % (23/103) en 2020, transmission HSH de 44 % (93/212) en 2019 vs 49 % (50/103) en 2020. Conclusion Dans notre centre, l’accès au dépistage de l’infection VIH a été considérablement réduit au cours de l’année 2020 du fait de la pandémie de la COVID-19. Cette réduction a été plus marquée au premier semestre en rapport avec la sévérité du premier confinement et s’est principalement faite aux dépens du dépistage réalisé en CeGGID, traduisant une limitation de l’offre de soins hors COVID-19 et/ou une diminution de l’exposition au VIH dans la population générale. Ces résultats ne doivent pas être interprétés comme une diminution de l’épidémie du VIH mais comme une sous-estimation liée à un manque d’informations. Des actions de dépistage doivent être déployées afin de limiter les diagnostics tardifs.","Da Conceicao, O.; Digumber, M.; Le Gac, S.; Phung, B.; Bachard, A.; Landman, R.; Damond, F.; Ghosn, J.; Yazdanpanah, Y.; Joly, V.",Infectious Diseases Now,566,20

Patients were grouped according to their needs for mechanical ventilation (ICU care) or not. Within the comorbidities studied, obesity was the only associated with greater severity and ICU admission. Both the percentage and the absolute number of neutrophils were higher in patients needing ICU care than non-ICU patients, whereas absolute lymphocyte count, and especially the percentage of lymphocytes, presented a deep decline in critical patients. There was no difference between the two groups of patients for CD4 T-lymphocytes, neither in percentage of lymphocyte nor in absolute number, however for CD8 T-cells the differences were significant for both parameters which were in decline in ICU patients. There was a firm correlation between the highest values of inflammation indicators with the decrease in percentage of CD8 T-lymphocytes. This effect was not seen with CD4 cells.

BACKGROUND: After coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak, frontline nurses embraced remarkable potential stress and huge workload when caring for coronavirus disease 2019 patients, which may lead to new challenges to work engagement. DESIGN: A large sample survey was conducted at the end of February 2020 in a designated hospital treating coronavirus disease 2019 patients in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province in China. T-test, one-way ANOVA, Chi-squared Test, Pearson correlation, and Hierarchical multiple regression were performed among 1040 nurses using SPSS 24.0. The STROBE checklist was followed for observational studies. RESULTS: The final model interpreted 27.3% of the variance, of which each block could explain 11.7%, 10.3%, and 7.9% R2 changes including sociodemographic characteristics, stress, and workload respectively. Work engagement was negatively correlated with stress and workload. The potential influencing factors included sociodemographic characteristics (married, rescue staff, cabin ward), stress (infection control, PPE discomfort), workload (mental demand, performance, frustration). CONCLUSIONS: Frontline nurses perceived low stress and workload, but high work engagement, especially in self-dedication. However, infection control, PPE discomfort, frustration were negatively associated with nurses' work engagement, while mental demand and good performance were positively associated with nurses' work engagement. Future interventions focused on decreasing frontline staff's infection risk and enhancing their self-confidence may be recommendable to promote their work engagement.","Zhang, Meng; Zhang, Ping; Liu, Yu; Wang, Hui; Hu, Kaili; Du, Meichen",J. clin. nurs,566,16

RESULTS: Participants perceived modest risk elevation from COVID-19 due to their opioid use, and perceived moderate risk to themselves or their community from COVID-19. Since learning about COVID-19, 31.2% reported decreasing their opioid use, and 26.0% reported increased motivation to quit. Thirty-seven percent of participants reported both their use and motivation to quit stayed the same; 16.6% reported decreased use and increased motivation to quit. Participants who reported that their opioid use increased after learning about COVID-19, or whose motivation to quit opioids decreased, were more likely to also be engaged in treatment than those whose use or motivation stayed the same. These preliminary findings suggest that there likely is an association between COVID-19, opioid use, and treatment engagement that merits further in-depth investigation.","Parker, Maria A; Agley, Jon; Adams, Zachary W; Villanti, Andrea C",BMC Res Notes,566,24

However, these are often distressing and anxiety provoking times for patients and staff. A product of patients' distress is an increase in ED behaviours specific to mealtimes. The aim of this quality improvement project was to decrease the number of ED behaviours at mealtimes in the dining room through the implementation of initiatives identified through diagnostic work. METHODS: The Model for Improvement was used as the systematic approach for this project. Baseline assessment included observations in the dining room, gathering of qualitative feedback from staff and patients and the development of an ED behaviours form used by patients and staff. The first change idea of a host role in the dining room was introduced, and the impact was assessed. RESULTS: The introduction of the host role has reduced the average number of ED behaviours per patient in the dining room by 35%. Postintervention feedback demonstrated that the introduction of the host role tackled the disorganisation and chaotic feeling in the dining room which in turn has reduced distress and anxiety for patients and staff. CONCLUSIONS: This paper shows the realities of a quality improvement (QI) project on an ED inpatient unit during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results are positive for changes made; however, a large challenge, as described has been staff engagement.","Gardner, Lucy; Trueman, Hayley",,566,14

This practice may lead to ineffective mitigation. In addition, identification of factors contributing to local disease re-emergence and assessment of global disease re-emergence require access to data about disease incidence and a large number of factors at the local level for the entire world. This paper presents Re-emerging Disease Alert (RED Alert), a web-based tool designed to help public health officials detect and understand infectious disease re-emergence. OBJECTIVE: Our objective is to bring together a variety of disease-related data and analytics needed to help public health analysts answer the following 3 primary questions for detecting and understanding disease re-emergence: Is there a potential disease re-emergence at the local (country) level? What are the potential contributing factors for this re-emergence? Is there a potential for global re-emergence? METHODS: We collected and cleaned disease-related data (eg, case counts, vaccination rates, and indicators related to disease transmission) from several data sources including the World Health Organization (WHO), Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), World Bank, and Gideon. We combined these data with machine learning and visual analytics into a tool called RED Alert to detect re-emergence for the following 4 diseases: measles, cholera, dengue, and yellow fever. We evaluated the performance of the machine learning models for re-emergence detection and reviewed the output of the tool through a number of case studies. RESULTS: Our supervised learning models were able to identify 82%-90% of the local re-emergence events, although with 18%-31% (except 46% for dengue) false positives. This is consistent with our goal of identifying all possible re-emergences while allowing some false positives. The review of the web-based tool through case studies showed that local re-emergence detection was possible and that the tool provided actionable information about potential factors contributing to the local disease re-emergence and trends in global disease re-emergence. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first tool that focuses specifically on disease re-emergence and addresses the important challenges mentioned above.","Parikh, Nidhi; Daughton, Ashlynn R; Rosenberger, William Earl; Aberle, Derek Jacob; Chitanvis, Maneesha Elizabeth; Altherr, Forest Michael; Velappan, Nileena; Fairchild, Geoffrey; Deshpande, Alina",JMIR Public Health Surveill,566,6

We therefore set out to analyze serial blood samples from mild-to-moderately ill patients in order to define the immune landscapes for differently progressed disease stages. MethodsTwenty-two COVID-19 patients were subjected to consecutive venipuncture within seven days after diagnosis or admittance to hospital. Flow cytometry was performed to analyze peripheral blood immune cell compositions and their activation as were plasma levels of cytokines and SARS-CoV-2 specific immunoglobulins. Healthy donors served as controls. ResultsIntegrating the kinetics of plasmablasts and SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies allowed for the definition of three disease stages of early COVID-19. The incubation phase was characterized by a sharp increase in pro-inflammatory monocytes and terminally differentiated cytotoxic T cells. The latter correlated significantly with elevated concentrations of IP-10. Early acute infection featured a peak in PD-1+ cytotoxic T cells, plasmablasts and increasing titers of virus specific antibodies. During late acute infection, immature neutrophils were enriched whereas all other parameters returned to baseline. ConclusionOur findings will help to define landmarks that are indispensable for the refinement of new anti-viral and anti-inflammatory therapeutics, and may also inform clinicians to optimize treatment and prevent fatal outcome.","Müller, Michael; Volzke, Johann; Subin, Behnam; Schmidt, Christian Johann; Geerdes-Fenge, Hilte; Reisinger, Emil Christian; Müller-Hilke, Brigitte",,566,8

Previous studies have demonstrated that changes in pulmonary blood volumes measured on computed tomography (CT) are associated with histopathological markers of pulmonary vascular pruning, suggesting that quantitative CT analysis may eventually be useful in the assessment pulmonary vascular dysfunction more broadly. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Building upon previous work, automated quantitative CT measures of small blood vessel volume and pulmonary vascular density were developed. Scans from 103 COVID-19 patients and 107 healthy volunteers were analyzed and their results compared, with comparisons made both on lobar and global levels. RESULTS: Compared to healthy volunteers, COVID-19 patients showed significant reduction in BV5 (pulmonary blood volume contained in blood vessels of <5 mm2) expressed as BV5/(total pulmonary blood volume; p < 0.0001), and significant increases in BV5-10 and BV 10 (pulmonary blood volumes contained in vessels between 5 and 10 mm2 and above 10 mm2, respectively, p < 0.0001). These changes were consistent across lobes. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 patients display striking anomalies in the distribution of blood volume within the pulmonary vascular tree, consistent with increased pulmonary vasculature resistance in the pulmonary vessels below the resolution of CT.","Lins, Muriel; Vandevenne, Jan; Thillai, Muhunthan; Lavon, Ben R; Lanclus, Maarten; Bonte, Stijn; Godon, Rik; Kendall, Irvin; De Backer, Jan; De Backer, Wilfried",Acad Radiol,566,21

These categories were presented to 246 young (18-39 years), middle (40-59 years), and older (60 years and older) English-speaking adults living in the United States who were asked to generate as many category exemplars as possible for each of the 70 categories. In order to understand differences in normative responses, we analyzed these responses a) between age groups within the current sample and b) in comparison to three previously published sets of norms. Experimental studies using such norms typically assume invariance of normative likelihoods across age and historical time. We replicate previous findings such that exemplar frequency correlations suggest moderate stability in generated category members between age groups and cohorts for many, but not all, categories. Further, analyses of rank-order correlations highlight that the traditional measure of typicality may not capture all aspects of typicality, namely that for some categories there is high consistency in the frequency of exemplars across age groups and/or norms, but the ordering of those exemplars differs significantly. We include a cluster analysis to aid in grouping categories based on relative stability across time, cohort, and age groups. These results emphasize the importance of maintaining and updating age-differentiated category norms.","Castro, Nichol; Curley, Taylor; Hertzog, Christopher",,566,24

MEG's spatial resolution critically depends on the approach used to solve the ill-posed inverse problem in order to transform sensor signals into cortical activation maps. Over recent years non-globally optimized solutions based on the use of adaptive beamformers (BF) gained popularity. When operating in the environment with a small number of uncorrelated sources the BFs perform optimally and yield high spatial resolution. However, the BFs are known to fail when dealing with correlated sources acting like poorly tuned spatial filters with low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the output timeseries and often meaningless cortical maps of power distribution. This fact poses a serious limitation on the broader use of this promising technique especially since fundamental mechanisms of brain functioning, its inherent symmetry and task-based experimental paradigms result into a great deal of correlation in the activity of cortical sources. To cope with this problem, we developed a novel data covariance modification approach that allows to build beamformers that maintain high spatial resolution when operating in the environments with correlated sources. At the core of our method is a projection operation applied to the vectorized sensor-space covariance matrix. This projection does not remove the activity of the correlated sources from the sensor-space covariance matrix but rather selectively handles their contributions to the covariance matrix and creates a sufficiently accurate approximation of an ideal data covariance that could hypothetically be observed should these sources be uncorrelated. Since the projection operation is reciprocal to the PSIICOS method developed by us earlier (Ossadtchi et al., 2018) we refer to the family of algorithms presented here as ReciPSIICOS. We assess the performance of the novel approach using realistically simulated MEG data and show its superior performance in comparison to the classical BF approaches and well established MNE as a method immune to source synchrony by design. We have also applied our approach to the MEG datasets from the two experiments involving two different auditory tasks. The analysis of experimental MEG datasets showed that beamformers from ReciPSIICOS family, but not the classical BF, discovered the expected bilateral focal sources in the primary auditory cortex and detected motor cortex activity associated with the audio-motor task. In most cases MNE managed well but as expected produced more spatially diffuse source distributions.

The purpose of this paper is to develop an integrative framework and research agenda on the role of companion robots in mitigating feelings of loneliness. Design/methodology/approach: A netnographic analysis of 595 online visual and textual descriptions offer empirical insights about the role of the companion robot Vector during the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings: The contributions of this study are twofold. First, it postulates that companion robots have the potential of mitigating feelings of loneliness (i.e. indicator of well-being). Second, this study contributes to transformative service by developing an integrative framework introducing the roles (personal assistant, relational peer and intimate buddy) that companion robots can fulfill to mitigate feelings of loneliness through building different types of supportive relationships. Research limitations/implications: The proposed research agenda encourages future service scholars to investigate 1) the role of robots in addressing loneliness, 2) design features that drive adoption of robots, 3) social support for different groups, 4) the operationalization and the measurement of loneliness and 5) an impact analysis of companion robots. Practical implications: Service providers and policy makers can leverage the insights about how companion robots can help reduce a sense of loneliness. Originality/value: The integrative framework on loneliness reduction, based on 595 unprompted online contributions issued during the COVID-19 pandemic, offers initial evidence for the impact of companion robots in reducing people's feelings of loneliness.","Odekerken-Schröder, Gaby; Mele, Cristina; Russo-Spena, Tiziana; Mahr, Dominik; Ruggiero, Andrea",J.

DESIGN: This study used a descriptive cross-sectional design. METHODS: This study was conducted in a training and research hospital with 25 non-intubated COVID-19 inpatients between 6 April and 13 May 2020 in Turkey. Data were collected using a Socio-demographic and Clinical Characteristics Form, the COVID-19 Response Separate Guidelines and the Omaha System and Nightingale Notes software. Data were analysed using descriptive statistical tests and the chi-square method. RESULTS: Using the Omaha System, it was shown that the patients' most common problems were communicable/infectious condition, respiration, circulation, pain, nutrition, personal care and substance use respectively. The most common signs and symptoms were signs of infection, fever, cough, respiratory distress and pain. The interventions that were performed most frequently to the patients included infection precautions, medication action/side effects, signs/symptoms-physical, dietary management and nursing care targets for intervention. These interventions were applied using the category of teaching, guidance and counselling. A significant improvement was observed in the patients' pre- and post-intervention knowledge, behaviour and status scores. CONCLUSIONS: The results showed that the Omaha System provided effective guidelines for diagnosing the problems, planning and implementing appropriate interventions for the COVID-19 patients. Therefore, it is recommended to use the Omaha System in nursing care of COVID-19 patients. IMPACT: This is the first study to identify the nursing problems of COVID-19 patients and to evaluate the outcomes of nursing interventions and care using an international taxonomy along with electronic health record software. The findings of this study can provide evidence-based guidelines addressing the nursing problems, interventions and outcomes of COVID-19 patients.","Ardic, Aysun; Turan, Ebru",J. adv. nurs,566,23

Unprecedented global demand for personal protective equipment (PPE) was complicated by limited availability and conflicting guidance from healthcare bodies. This study aimed to assess perceived confidence and knowledge of Public Health England's PPE guidance amongst doctors of varying specialties and grades. Method: A nationwide 11-point survey comprising of multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and a Likert scale assessing perceived confidence (1=not confident, 5=very confident) was disseminated to U.K. based doctors using multiple platforms. Results: Data collated from 697 respondents revealed average perceived confidence was low. Notably, 59% felt they had received insufficient education regarding up-to-date guidance, with 81% advocating further training. Anaesthetics and ophthalmology were the highest and lowest scoring specialties in knowledge based MCQs, achieving 59% and 31% respectively. Subsequent statistical analysis revealed significant differences between specialties.' Conclusions: Ensuring consistency in published PPE guidance and education can develop doctor's confidence and knowledge of appropriate PPE use. The absence of a unified consensus and global education regarding the use of PPE poses significant ramifications for patient and healthcare professional (HCP) safety whilst risking further depletion of already sparse resources.","Al-Hity, S.; Bhamra, N.; Kumar, R.; Gupta, K.; Howard, J.; Jolly, K.; Darr, A.",British Journal of Surgery,566,20

The objective of the study was to determine the association between high risk of OSA, comorbidities, and increased risk for COVID-19, hospitalization, and intensive care unit (ICU) treatment. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional population-based web survey in adults in 14 countries/regions. The survey included sociodemographic variables and comorbidities. Participants were asked questions about COVID-19, hospitalization, and ICU treatment. Standardized questionnaire (STOP questionnaire for high risk of OSA) was included. Multivariable logistic regression was conducted adjusting for various factors. RESULTS: Out of 26,539 respondents, 20,598 (35.4% male) completed the survey. Mean age and BMI of participants were 41.5 ± 16.0 years and 24.0 ± 5.0 kg/m2, respectively. The prevalence of physician-diagnosed OSA was 4.1% and high risk of OSA was 9.5%. We found that high risk of OSA (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.72, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.20, 2.47) and diabetes (aOR 2.07, 95% CI: 1.23, 3.48) were associated with reporting of a COVID-19 diagnosis. High risk for OSA (aOR 2.11, 95% CI: 1.10-4.01), being male (aOR: 2.82, 95% CI: 1.55-5.12), having diabetes (aOR: 3.93, 95% CI: 1.70-9.12), and having depression (aOR: 2.33, 95% CI: 1.15-4.77) were associated with increased risk of hospitalization or ICU treatment.

The pandemic has been so prominent partly due to the high infection rate of the virus and its variants. In response, one of the most effective ways to stop infection is rapid diagnosis. The main-stream screening method, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), is time-consuming, laborious and in short supply. Chest radiography is an alternative screening method for the COVID-19 and computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) has proven to be a viable solution at low cost and with fast speed; however, one of the challenges in training the CAD models is the limited number of training data, especially at the onset of the pandemic. This becomes outstanding precisely when the quick and cheap type of diagnosis is critically needed for flattening the infection curve. To address this challenge, we propose the use of a low-shot learning approach named imprinted weights, taking advantage of the abundance of samples from known illnesses such as pneumonia to improve the detection performance on COVID-19.","Zhang, Jianxing; Xi, Pengcheng; Ebadi, Ashkan; Azimi, Hilda; Tremblay, Stephane; Wong, Alexander",,566,15

The first COVID-19 national lockdown led to an increasing reliance on home-carers and we investigate the short- and longer-term impacts of lockdown on their mental health. METHODS: Data from 9737 adult participants (aged 16+) from the UK Household Longitudinal Study (Understanding Society) were used to explore changes in 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) score between (a) pre-pandemic (2019) and early lockdowns (April 2020) and (b) early and later (July 2020) lockdowns. RESULTS: GHQ-12 scores among home-carers were higher pre-lockdown and increased more than for non-carers from 2019 to April 2020 with further increases for home-carers compared with non-carers between April and July. Compared with respondents caring for a spouse/partner, those caring for a child under 18 had a particularly marked increase in GHQ-12 score between 2019 and April, as did those caring for someone with a learning disability. Home-carers of children under 18 improved from April to July while those caring for adult children saw a marked worsening of their mental health. Home-carers with greater care burden saw larger increases in GHQ-12 score from 2019 to April and from April to July, and increases through both periods were greater for home-carers who had formal help prior to lockdown but then lost it. CONCLUSIONS: The mental health of home-carers deteriorated more during lockdown than non-carers. Policies that reinstate support for them and their care-recipients will benefit the health of both vulnerable groups.","Whitley, Elise; Reeve, Kelly; Benzeval, Michaela",Psychol Med,566,21

But COVID-19 emerged as a crippling blow for which huge reverse migration is being noticed in the state. So the study tried to investigate labour supply and employment opportunity in rural areas due to COVID-19-led reverse migration and to examine the impact of COVID-19 on employment status, income profile and livelihood of returned migrants in Odisha. The study also discusses the possible measures to create alternative livelihood by rebuilding the rural economy after COVID-19. Both secondary and primary data are used in the study. Descriptive statistics and regression model are used in the study to examine the vulnerability of migrants during the period of COVID-19. The study found a sudden rise in labour supply with a huge scale is catch sight of the rural economy of Odisha. Job loss is the biggest problem faced by migrants followed by income loss. The study found that income of migrants, household income excluding migrants and nature of work have significant impact on the vulnerability of migrants.JEL Classification Codes: J21, J22, J46","Behera, Minaketan Mishra Sibanarayan Behera Alok Ranjan",The Indian Economic Journal,566,20

However, little is known about the effect of social factors on PA among older adults during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Therefore, we aimed to clarify the association between socioeconomic status, social participation, and PA during the pandemic. A cross-sectional study was conducted on 999 community-dwelling residents aged 65-90 years. A self-administered questionnaire was used to collect socioeconomic status, social participation, and PA data in August 2020. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to calculate the odds ratios (ORs) for the associations between socioeconomic status, social participation, and maintaining PA. For both sexes, PA was reduced by approximately 5%-10% after the onset of COVID-19-related distancing restrictions. Men with a low socioeconomic status were less physically active (OR = 0.49, 95% CI: 0.30-0.82). Women who reported social participation had higher odds of maintaining PA (OR = 1.67, 95% CI: 1.13-2.45) during the restrictions. Higher socioeconomic status and social participation levels before the COVID-19 pandemic may have helped older adults to maintain PA during the COVID-19 pandemic. Further research is needed to clarify the potential effects of these factors on the health of older adults.","Sasaki, Sachiko; Sato, Akinori; Tanabe, Yoshie; Matsuoka, Shinji; Adachi, Atsuhiro; Kayano, Toshiya; Yamazaki, Hiroshi; Matsuno, Yuichi; Miyake, Ann; Watanabe, Toshihiro",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),566,20

The available knowledge on the viral genomics, molecular biology and pathogenicity of viruses of the Coronaviridae family and other Nidovirales, forms a helpful template for understanding the present pandemic outbreak. However, important questions remain unanswered about the underlying mechanism causing the very high case fatality ratios (CFR) and mechanisms regarding severe reactions like ARDS, fatal cardiac and renal failures, associated with a number of important comorbidity factors. Immunological reactions to lung alveoles in particular (involving lung macrophages and alveolar epithelial cell damage) in late phase ARDS in SARS-like CoV diseases, so far may not have received enough attention.

Organic farming is a potential way to reduce environmental impacts by excluding synthetic pesticides and fertilizers from the process. Despite ecological benefits, it is unlikely that conversion to organic can be financially viable for farmers, without additional support and incentives from consumers. This study models the interplay between consumer preferences and socio-environmental issues related to agriculture and food production. We operationalize the novel concept of extended agro-food supply chain and simulate adaptive behavior of farmers, food processors, retailers, and customers. Not only the operational factors (e.g., price, quantity, and lead time), but also the behavioral factors (e.g., attitude, perceived control, social norms, habits, and personal goals) of the food suppliers and consumers are considered in order to foster organic farming. We propose an integrated approach combining agent-based, discrete-event, and system dynamics modeling for a case of wine supply chain. Findings demonstrate the feasibility and superiority of the proposed model over the traditional sustainable supply chain models in incorporating the feedback between consumers and producers and analyzing management scenarios that can urge farmers to expand organic agriculture. Results further indicate that demand-side participation in transition pathways towards sustainable agriculture can become a time-consuming effort if not accompanied by the middle actors between consumers and farmers. In practice, our proposed model may serve as a decision-support tool to guide evidence-based policymaking in the food and agriculture sector.","Taghikhah, Firouzeh; Voinov, Alexey; Shukla, Nagesh; Filatova, Tatiana; Anufriev, Mikhail",European journal of operational research,566,24

Furthermore, the measures taken by governments to control the pandemic have led to increased anxiety, stress, and depression, which affect physical and mental health, all of which are influenced by nutritional status, diet, and lifestyle. The Mediterranean diet (MD), Atlantic diet (AD), and the Dietary Guidelines for Americans all provide the essential vitamins, minerals, and phenolic compounds needed to activate enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidant responses. However, viral pandemics such as the current COVID-19 crisis entail high oxidative damage caused by both the infection and the resultant social stresses within populations, which increases the probability and severity of infection. Balanced dietary patterns such as the MD and the AD are characterized by the consumption of fruit, vegetables, legumes, olive oil, and whole grains with low intakes of processed foods and red meat. For a healthy lifestyle in young adults, the MD in particular provides the required amount of antioxidants per day for vitamins D (0.3-3.8 µg), E (17.0 mg), C (137.2-269.8 mg), A (1273.3 µg), B-12 (1.5-2.0 µg), and folate (455.1-561.3 µg), the minerals Se (120.0 µg), Zn (11.0 mg), Fe (15.0-18.8 mg), and Mn (5.2-12.5 mg), and polyphenols (1171.00 mg) needed to maintain an active immune response. However, all of these diets are deficient in the recommended amount of vitamin D (20 µg/d). Therefore, vulnerable populations such as elders and obese individuals could benefit from antioxidant supplementation to improve their antioxidant response. Although evidence remains scarce, there is some indication that a healthy diet, along with supplemental antioxidant intake, is beneficial to COVID-19 patients.","Trujillo-Mayol, Igor; Guerra-Valle, María; Casas-Forero, Nidia; Sobral, M Madalena C; Viegas, Olga; Alarcón-Enos, Julio; Ferreira, Isabel Mplvo; Pinho, Olívia","Adv. nutr.

Home-based primary care (HBPC) provides such patients access to longitudinal medical care at home. The purpose of this study was to describe the challenges and adaptations by HBPC practices made during the first surge of the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: Mixed-methods national survey. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: HBPC practices identified as members of the American Academy of Homecare Medicine (AAHCM) or participants of Home-Centered Care Institute (HCCI) training programs. METHODS: Online survey regarding practice responses to COVID-19 surges, COVID-19 testing, the use of telemedicine, practice challenges due to COVID-19, and adaptations to address these challenges. Descriptive statistics and t tests described frequency distributions of nominal and categorical data; qualitative content analysis was used to summarize responses to the open-ended questions. RESULTS: Seventy-nine practices across 29 states were included in the final analyses. Eighty-five percent of practices continued to provide in-person care and nearly half cared for COVID-19 patients. Most practices pivoted to new use of video visits (76.3%). The most common challenges were as follows: patient lack of familiarity with telemedicine (81.9%), patient anxiety (77.8%), clinician anxiety (69.4%), technical difficulties reaching patients (66.7%), and supply shortages including masks, gown, and disinfecting materials (55.6%). Top adaptive strategies included using telemedicine (95.8%), reducing in-person visits (81.9%), providing resources for patients (52.8%), and staff training in PPE use and COVID testing (52.8%). CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: HBPC practices experienced a wide array of COVID-19-related challenges. Most continued to see patients in the home, augmented visits with telemedicine and creatively adapted to the challenges. An increased recognition of the need for in-home care by health systems who observed its critical role in caring for fragile older adults may serve as a silver lining to the otherwise dark sky of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Ritchie, Christine S; Gallopyn, Naomi; Sheehan, Orla C; Sharieff, Shanaz Ahmed; Franzosa, Emily; Gorbenko, Ksenia; Ornstein, Katherine A; Federman, Alex D; Brody, Abraham A; Leff, Bruce",J Am Med Dir Assoc,566,1

Drug gangs and paramilitary groups called &lt;italic&gt;milícias&lt;/italic&gt; control some regions of the city where the government is not present, specially in the slums. Due to the characteristics of such two distinct groups, it was observed that the evolution of COVID-19 is different in those two regions, in comparison with the regions controlled by the government. In order to understand qualitatively those observations, we divided the city in three regions controlled by the government, by the drug gangs and by the &lt;italic&gt;milícias&lt;/italic&gt;, respectively, and we consider a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Dead &lt;italic&gt;(SIRD)&lt;/italic&gt;-like epidemic model where the three regions are coupled.

Based on Baidu Migration data and the confirmed cases data, we identified two key factors affecting the later (e.g February 27, 2020) cumulative confirmed cases in non-Wuhan region (y). One is the sum travelers from Wuhan during January 20 to January 26 (x1), which had higher infected probability but lower transmission ability because the human-to-human transmission risk of COVID-19 was confirmed and announced on January 20. The other is the seed cases from Wuhan before January 19, which had higher transmission ability and could be represented with the confirmed cases before January 29 (x2) due to a mean 10-day delay between infection and detection. A simple yet effective regression model then was established as follow: y= 70.0916+0.0054*x1+2.3455*x2 (n = 44, R2 = 0.9330, P<10-7). Even the lock-down date only delay or in advance 3 days, the estimated confirmed cases by February 27 in non-Wuhan region will increase 35.21% or reduce 30.74% - 48.59%. Although the above interventions greatly reduced the human mobility, Wuhan lock-down combined with nationwide traffic restrictions and Stay At Home Movement do have a determining effect on the ongoing spread of COVID-19 across China Mainland. The strategy adopted by China has changed the fast-rising curve of newly diagnosed cases, the international community should learn from lessons of Wuhan and experience from China. Efforts of 29 Provinces and 44 prefecture-level cities against COVID-19 were also assessed preliminarily according to the interpretive model.

We aimed to identify enough cases that could be evaluated in aggregate to better understand the neuroimaging manifestations of COVID-19 in the paediatric population. METHODS: An international call for cases of children with encephalopathy related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and abnormal neuroimaging findings was made. Clinical history and associated plasma and cerebrospinal fluid data were requested. These data were reviewed by a central neuroradiology panel, a child neurologist, and a paediatric infectious diseases expert. The children were categorised on the basis of their time of probable exposure to SARS-CoV-2. In addition, cases were excluded when a direct link to SARS-CoV-2 infection could not be established or an established alternate diagnostic cause could be hypothesised. The accepted referral centre imaging data, from ten countries, were remotely reviewed by a central panel of five paediatric neuroradiologists and a consensus opinion obtained on the imaging findings. FINDINGS: 38 children with neurological disease related to SARS-CoV-2 infection were identified from France (n=13), the UK (n=8), the USA (n=5), Brazil (n=4), Argentina (n=4), India (n=2), Peru (n=1), and Saudi Arabia (n=1). Recurring patterns of disease were identified, with neuroimaging abnormalities ranging from mild to severe. The most common imaging patterns were postinfectious immune-mediated acute disseminated encephalomyelitis-like changes of the brain (16 patients), myelitis (eight patients), and neural enhancement (13 patients). Cranial nerve enhancement could occur in the absence of corresponding neurological symptoms. Splenial lesions (seven patients) and myositis (four patients) were predominantly observed in children with multisystem inflammatory syndrome. Cerebrovascular complications in children were less common than in adults. Significant pre-existing conditions were absent and most children had favourable outcomes. However, fatal atypical CNS co-infections developed in four previously healthy children infected with SARS-CoV-2. INTERPRETATION: Acute-phase and delayed-phase SARS-CoV-2-related CNS abnormalities are seen in children. Recurring patterns of disease and atypical neuroimaging manifestations can be found and should be recognised being as potentially due to SARS-CoV-2 infection as an underlying aetiological factor. Studies of paediatric specific cohorts are needed to better understand the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the CNS at presentation and on long-term follow-up in children.

With enormous amounts of information originating in sources with uncertain degree of validation and accuracy, it is essential to provide executive-level decision-makers with the most actionable, pertinent, and updated data analysis to enable them to adapt their strategy swiftly and competently. OBJECTIVE: We report here the origination of a COVID-19 dedicated response in the Israel Defense Forces with the assembly of an operational Data Center for the Campaign against Coronavirus. METHODS: Spearheaded by directors with clinical, operational, and data analytics orientation, a multidisciplinary team utilized existing and newly developed platforms to collect and analyze large amounts of information on an individual level in the context of SARS-CoV-2 contraction and infection. RESULTS: Nearly 300,000 responses to daily questionnaires were recorded and were merged with other data sets to form a unified data lake. By using basic as well as advanced analytic tools ranging from simple aggregation and display of trends to data science application, we provided commanders and clinicians with access to trusted, accurate, and personalized information and tools that were designed to foster operational changes and mitigate the propagation of the pandemic. The developed tools aided in the in the identification of high-risk individuals for severe disease and resulted in a 30% decline in their attendance to their units. Moreover, the queue for laboratory examination for COVID-19 was optimized using a predictive model and resulted in a high true-positive rate of 20%, which is more than twice as high as the baseline rate (2.28%, 95% CI 1.63%-3.19%).

During viral infection, autophagy can act as a surveillance mechanism that delivers viral antigens to the endosomal/lysosomal compartments that are enriched in immune sensors. Additionally, activated immune sensors can signal to activate autophagy. To evade this antiviral activity, many viruses elaborate functions to block the autophagy pathway at a variety of steps. Alternatively, some viruses actively subvert autophagy for their own benefit. Manipulated autophagy has been proposed to facilitate nearly every stage of the viral lifecycle in direct and indirect ways. In this review, we synthesize the extensive literature on virus-autophagy interactions, emphasizing the role of autophagy in antiviral immunity and the mechanisms by which viruses subvert autophagy for their own benefit.","Jordan, Tristan X.; Randall, Glenn",Microbes and Infection,566,24

Methods We retrospectively investigated the data on the impact of COVID-19 on renal transplantation, between 2019-2020 in a nationwide analysis from 8 public and 10 private sector hospitals of India. Results On comparing the yearly data, the number of living-related transplants and deceased donor transplants declined by 48% (2610 vs 1370) and 49% (194 vs 99) respectively. The out-patient numbers and in-center admissions decreased by 40.4 % (6,16,741 vs 3,67,962) and 30.8 % (73,190 vs 49,918) respectively. There was no increase in the number of renal or graft biopsies in the COVID-19 era. The number of waitlisted patients on hemodialysis was higher in public (3,04,898 vs 3,38,343) when compared to private (1,63,096 vs 1,50,292) in the last 2 years. Similarly, the number of waitlisted patients on peritoneal dialysis (4655 vs 3526) was higher in public sector compared to private sector (932 vs 745). The decline in living transplants during the pandemic was higher in public setups (58%) compared to the private (49%). On the contrary, the decline in deceased donation was higher in private (57.9%) relative to public (50.6%). Conclusion COVID-19 has adversely affected the transplantation activities across the Indian transplantation centers, with a disproportionately higher impact on waitlisted patients in public sector programs. A sound prioritization of healthcare resources is mandated to safeguard the most deprived and high-risk waitlisted patients during the pandemic.","Meshram, Dr. Hari Shankar; Kute, Dr. Vivek B.; Swarnalatha, Dr. G.; Hegde, Dr. Umapati; Sharma, Dr. Ashish; Sahay, Dr. Manisha; Guleria, Dr. Sandeep; Raju, Dr. Sree Bhushan; Eapen, Dr. Jeetu; Ray, Dr. Deepak S.; Chaudhary, Dr. Arpita Roy; Patel, Dr. Himanshu; S, Dr. Vishwanath; Pathak, Dr. Vivek; Agarwal, Dr. Dhananjay; Bahadur, Dr. M.M.; Verma, Dr. P.P.; Anandh, Dr. Urmila; Krishna, Dr. Amresh; Abraham, Dr. Abi; Mishra, Dr. Vineet",Transplant Proc,566,24

It is still unclear whether people engaged in physical activity are at an increased risk of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and severe forms of COVID‐19. In order to provide data to help answer this question, we, therefore, investigated the effects of endurance training on the levels of host proteins involved in SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in mice. Eight‐week‐old C57BL/6J mice were subjected to treadmill running (17–25 m/min, 60–90 min, 5 sessions/week, 8 weeks). After the intervention, the levels of angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE2; host receptor for SARS‐CoV‐2), transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2; host protease priming fusion of SARS‐CoV‐2 to host cell membranes), FURIN (host protease that promotes binding of SARS‐CoV‐2 to host receptors), and Neuropilin‐1 (host coreceptor for SARS‐CoV‐2) were measured in 10 organs that SARS‐CoV‐2 can infect (larynx, trachea, lung, heart, jejunum, ileum, colon, liver, kidney, and testis). Six organs (heart, lung, jejunum, liver, trachea, and ileum) showed changes in the levels of at least one of the proteins. Endurance training increased ACE2 levels in heart (+66.4%), lung (+37.1%), jejunum (+24.7%) and liver (+27.4%), and FURIN in liver (+17.9%) tissue. In contrast, endurance training decreased Neuropilin‐1 levels in liver (−39.7%), trachea (−41.2%), and ileum (−39.7%), and TMPRSS2 in lung (−11.3%). Taken together, endurance training altered the levels of host proteins involved in SARS‐CoV‐2 cell entry in an organ‐dependent manner.","Tamura, Yuki; Jee, Eunbin; Kouzaki, Karina; Kotani, Takaya; Nakazato, Koichi",Physiol Rep,566,22

Objectives: To ascertain the physiologic, hematologic, and imaging basis of lung injury in severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods: Clinical, physiologic, and laboratory data were collated. Radiologic (computed tomography (CT) pulmonary angiography [n = 39] and dual-energy CT [DECT, n = 20]) studies were evaluated: observers quantified CT patterns (including the extent of abnormal lung and the presence and extent of dilated peripheral vessels) and perfusion defects on DECT. Coagulation status was assessed using thromboelastography. Measurements and Results: In 39 consecutive patients (male:female, 32:7; mean age, 53 ± 10 yr [range, 29–79 yr]; Black and minority ethnic, n = 25 [64%]), there was a significant vascular perfusion abnormality and increased physiologic dead space (dynamic compliance, 33.7 ± 14.7 ml/cm H(2)O; Murray lung injury score, 3.14 ± 0.53; mean ventilatory ratios, 2.6 ± 0.8) with evidence of hypercoagulability and fibrinolytic “shutdown”. The mean CT extent (±SD) of normally aerated lung, ground-glass opacification, and dense parenchymal opacification were 23.5 ± 16.7%, 36.3 ± 24.7%, and 42.7 ± 27.1%, respectively. Dilated peripheral vessels were present in 21/33 (63.6%) patients with at least two assessable lobes (including 10/21 [47.6%] with no evidence of acute pulmonary emboli).

The rapid viral spread has made the disease a public health emergency of worldwide concern. The gold standard for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 is reverse transcription followed by qualitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR); however, the role of viral load quantification has not been thoroughly investigated yet. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop a high-precision quantitative one-step RT-qPCR reaction using the association of the viral target and the human target in the same reaction. METHODS: The assay standardization involved the absolute quantification method with serial dilutions of a plasmid with the N gene in a biological matrix to build a standard curve. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The results demonstrated the possibility of quantifying as few as 2.5 copies/reaction and analysis of 244 patients with known results selected by cross-section revealed 100% agreement with a qualitative RT-qPCR assay registered by Anvisa. In this population, it was possible to quantify patients with between 2.59 and 3.5 × 10(7) copies per reaction and negative patients continued to indicate the same result. CONCLUSION: This assay can be a useful tool for the proper patients management, since the level and duration of viral replication are important factors to assess the risk of transmission and to guide decisions regarding the isolation and release of patients also, an accurate diagnosis is critical information whereas the current COVID-19 pandemic represents the biggest current global health problem.","da Silva Queiroz, Jackson Alves; de Cássia Pontello Rampazzo, Rita; da Silva Filho, Edivá Basílio; Oliveira, Gabriella Sgorlon; da Costa Oliveira, Suyane; Botelho Souza, Luan Felipo; dos Santos Pereira, Soraya; de Souza Rodrigues, Moreno Magalhães; Salvador Maia, Adriana Cristina; da Silva, Cicileia Correia; de Melo Mendonça, Aline Linhares Ferreira; Lugtenburg, Celina Aparecida Bertoni; de Assis Araújo Aguiar, Francisco; de Souza Soares Rodrigues, Rosiane; Nemeth Santos, Caio Henrique; Di Sabatino Guimarães, Alice Paula; Máximo, Fernando Rodrigues; de Oliveira dos Santos, Alcione; Krieger, Marco Aurélio; Salcedo, Juan Miguel Villalobos; Dall’Acqua, Deusilene Souza Vieira",Int J Infect Dis,566,33

In the first half of 2020 this disease has already converted into a global pandemic. Various treatment options were being tried all over the world. Some studies showed beneficial effects of corticosteroids in covid 19. Hence, we designed this study to compare the effect of two steroids in moderate to severe covid 19 disease. OBJECTIVES: To compare the efficacy and safety of dexamethasone and methylprednisolone in moderate to severe covid 19 disease. STUDY SETTINGS: Fatima Memorial Hospital, Lahore and Ganga Ram hospital, Lahore. STUDY DESIGN: Quasi experimental, interventional study. DURATION OF STUDY: From 1st June 2020 to 30th June 2020. METHODOLOGY: Sample size and technique: there were total 100 patients; 35 patients received dexamethasone and 65 were kept in methylprednisolone receiving group. RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 57.91 years in dexamethasone group and 54.86 years in methylprednisolone group. In dexamethasone group, there were 15 (42.8%) critically ill patients who were shifted to Intensive care unit (ICU) and seven (20%) of them needed ventilatory support, whereas in methylprednisolone group 22 (33.8%) had to be admitted in ICU with eight (12.3%) patient needing ventilator. As outcome measure, patients in both the groups showed marked improvement in temperature, oxygen requirement and C-reactive protein (CRP) on day 5. Only six (17.1%) patient died who received dexamethasone while 10 (15.3%) patients died among those receiving methylprednisolone.

METHODS: In this observational, longitudinal cohort study, all neurosurgical admissions that presented to our department between February 1 and April 15 during the COVID-19 pandemic and during the same time period in 2019 were identified and categorized according to the presence of a neuro-emergency, the route of admission, management, and the category of disease. Further, the clinical course of patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) and chronic subdural hematoma (cSDH) was investigated representatively for severe vascular and semi-urgent traumatic conditions that present with a wide variety of symptoms. RESULTS: During the pandemic, the percentage of neuro-emergencies among all neurosurgical admissions remained similar but a larger proportion presented through the emergency department than through the outpatient clinic or by referral (*p = 0.009). The total number of neuro-emergencies was significantly reduced (*p = 0.0007) across all types of disease, particularly in vascular (*p = 0.036) but also in spinal (*p = 0.007) and hydrocephalus (*p = 0.048) emergencies. Patients with spinal emergencies presented 48 h later (*p = 0.001) despite comparable symptom severity. For aSAH, the number of cases, aSAH grade, aneurysm localization, and treatment modality did not change but strikingly, elderly patients with cSDH presented less frequently, with more severe symptoms (*p = 0.046), and were less likely to reach favorable outcome (*p = 0.003) at discharge compared with previous years. CONCLUSIONS: Despite pandemic-related restrictive measures and reallocation of resources, patients with neuro-emergencies should be encouraged to present regardless of the severity of symptoms because deferred presentation may result in adverse outcome. Thus, conservation of critical healthcare resources remains essential in spite of fighting COVID-19.","Hecht, Nils; Wessels, Lars; Werft, Finn-Ove; Schneider, Ulf C.; Czabanka, Marcus; Vajkoczy, Peter",Acta Neurochir (Wien),566,16

Microglia are professional antigen presenting cells that reside in the central nervous system (CNS) parenchyma that are poised to respond to viral insults. However, the role of microglia in initiating and coordinating the antiviral response is not completely understood. Utilizing Theiler’s murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV), a neurotropic picornavirus, and PLX5622, a small molecule inhibitor of colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) signaling that can deplete microglia in the CNS; we investigated the role of the CSF1R-microglia axis in neurotropic picornavirus infection of C57BL/6J and SJL/J mice. These mouse strains differ in their ability to clear TMEV and exhibit different neurological disease in response to TMEV infection. CSF1R antagonism in C57BL/6J mice, which normally clear TMEV in the CNS, led to acute fatal encephalitis. In contrast, CSF1R antagonism in SJL/J mice, which normally develop a chronic CNS TMEV infection, did not result in acute encephalitis, but exacerbated TMEV-induced demyelination. Immunologically, inhibition of CSF1R in C57BL/6J mice reduced major histocompatibility complex II expression in microglia, decreased the proportion of regulatory T cells in the CNS, and upregulated proinflammatory pathways in CNS T cells. Acute CSF1R inhibition in SJL/J mice had no effect on microglial MHC-II expression and upregulated anti-inflammatory pathways in CNS T cells, however chronic CSF1R inhibition resulted in broad immunosuppression. Our results demonstrate strain-specific effects of the CSF1R-microglia axis in the context of neurotropic viral infection as well as inherent differences in microglial antigen presentation and subsequent T cell crosstalk that contribute to susceptibility to neurotropic picornavirus infection.","Sanchez, John Michael S.; DePaula-Silva, Ana Beatriz; Doty, Daniel J.; Hanak, Tyler J.; Truong, Amanda; Libbey, Jane E.; Fujinami, Robert S.",Front Immunol,566,30

This study estimates the association between case counts of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection and social vulnerability in the U.S., identifying counties at increased vulnerability to the pandemic. Methods Using Social Vulnerability Index and COVID-19 case count data, an ordinary least squares regression model was fitted to assess the “global” relationship between COVID-19 case counts and social vulnerability. Local relationships were assessed using a geographically weighted regression model, which is effective in exploring spatial non-stationarity. Results As of May 12, 2020, a total of 1,320,909 people had been diagnosed with COVID-19 in the U.S. Of the counties included in this study (91.5%, 2,844/3,108), the highest case count was recorded in Trousdale, Tennessee (16,525.22 per 100,000) and the lowest in Tehama, California (1.54 per 100,000). At the “global” level, overall Social Vulnerability Index (e β=1.65, p=0.03) and minority status and language (e β=6.69, p<0.001) were associated with increased COVID-19 case counts. However, based on the “local” geographically weighted model, the association between social vulnerability and COVID-19 varied among counties. Overall, minority status and language, household composition and transportation, and housing and disability predicted COVID-19 infection. Conclusions Large-scale disasters differentially affect the health of marginalized communities. In this study, minority status and language, household composition and transportation, and housing and disability predicted COVID-19 case counts in the U.S. Addressing the social factors that create poor health is essential to reducing inequities in the health impacts of disasters.","Karaye, Ibraheem M.; Horney, Jennifer A.",Am J Prev Med,566,26

In this paper, we propose an extension of the epidemiological SEIR model to enable a detailed analysis of commonly discussed tailored measures of epidemic control—among them group-specific protection and the use of tracing apps. We introduce groups into the SEIR model that may differ both in their underlying parameters as well as in their behavioral response to public health interventions. Moreover, we allow for different infectiousness parameters within and across groups, different asymptomatic, hospitalization, and lethality rates, as well as different take-up rates of tracing apps. We then examine predictions from these models for a variety of scenarios. Our results visualize the sharp trade-offs between different goals of epidemic control, namely a low death toll, avoiding overload of the health system, and a short duration of the epidemic. We show that a combination of tailored mechanisms, e.g., the protection of vulnerable groups together with a “trace & isolate” approach, can be effective in preventing a high death toll. Protection of vulnerable groups without further measures requires unrealistically strict isolation. A key insight is that high compliance is critical for the effectiveness of a “trace & isolate” approach. Our model allows to analyze the interplay of group-specific social distancing and tracing also beyond our case study in scenarios with a large number of groups reflecting, e.g., sectoral, regional, or age differentiation and group-specific behavioural responses.","Grimm, Veronika; Mengel, Friederike; Schmidt, Martin",Sci Rep,566,30

In this article we introduce the concept of pathways to rapid adaptation to crisis events to bring attention to the double-edged role that institutions play in simultaneously enabling and constraining swift responses to emerging crises. To develop this concept, we draw on empirical evidence from a case study of the iconic Maine lobster (Homarus americanus) industry. In the Gulf of Maine, the availability of Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus) stock, a key source of bait in the Maine lobster industry, declined sharply. We investigate the patterns of bait use in the fishery over an 18-year period (2002–2019) and how the lobster industry was able to abruptly adapt to the decline of locally-sourced herring in 2019 that came to be called the bait crisis. We found that adaptation strategies to the crisis were diverse, largely uncoordinated, and imperfectly aligned, but ultimately led to a system-level shift towards a more diverse and globalized bait supply. This shift was enabled by existing institutions and hastened an evolution in the bait system that was already underway, as opposed to leading to system transformation.

This diagnosis is challenging as most of the patients having COVID-19 infection stay asymptomatic while others showing symptoms are hard to distinguish from patients having different respiratory infections such as severe flu and Pneumonia. Due to cost and time-consuming wet-lab diagnostic tests for COVID-19, there is an utmost requirement for some alternate, non-invasive, rapid, and discounted automatic screening system. A chest CT scan can effectively be used as an alternative modality to detect and diagnose the COVID-19 infection. In this study, we present an automatic COVID-19 diagnostic and severity prediction system called COVIDC (COVID-19 detection using CT scans) that uses deep feature maps from the chest CT scans for this purpose. Our newly proposed system not only detects COVID-19 but also predicts its severity by using a two-phase classification approach (COVID vs non-COVID, and COVID-19 severity) with deep feature maps and different shallow supervised classification algorithms such as SVMs and random forest to handle data scarcity. We performed a stringent COVIDC performance evaluation not only through 10-fold cross-validation and an external validation dataset but also in a real setting under the supervision of an experienced radiologist. In all the evaluation settings, COVIDC outperformed all the existing state-of-the-art methods designed to detect COVID-19 with an F1 score of 0.94 on the validation dataset and justified its use to diagnose COVID-19 effectively in the real setting by classifying correctly 9 out of 10 COVID-19 CT scans. We made COVIDC openly accessible through a cloud-based webserver and python code available at https://sites.google.com/view/wajidarshad/software and https://github.com/wajidarshad/covidc.","Abbasi, Wajid Arshad; Abbas, Syed Ali; Andleeb, Saiqa; ul Islam, Ghafoor; Ajaz, Syeda Adin; Arshad, Kinza; Khalil, Sadia; Anjam, Asma; Ilyas, Kashif; Saleem, Mohsib; Chughtai, Jawad; Abbas, Ayesha",Inform Med Unlocked,566,20

The combination of mutations in the 501Y.V2 variant first detected in South Africa include the N501Y, K417N, and E484K mutations in the receptor binding domain (RBD) as well as mutations in the N-terminal domain (NTD). Here we address whether the 501Y.V2 variant could escape the neutralizing antibody response elicited by natural infection with earlier variants. We were the first to outgrow two variants of 501Y.V2 from South Africa, designated 501Y.V2.HV001dF and 501Y.V2.HV002. We examined the neutralizing effect of convalescent plasma collected from six adults hospitalized with COVID-19 using a microneutralization assay with live (authentic) virus. Whole genome sequencing of the infecting virus of the plasma donors confirmed the absence of the spike mutations which characterize 501Y.V2. We infected with 501Y.V2.HV001dF and 501Y.V2.HV002 and compared plasma neutralization to first wave virus which contained the D614G mutation but no RBD or NTD mutations. We observed that neutralization of the 501Y.V2 variants was strongly attenuated, with IC50 6 to 200-fold higher relative to first wave virus. The degree of attenuation varied between participants and included a knockout of neutralization activity. This observation indicates that 501Y.V2 may escape the neutralizing antibody response elicited by prior natural infection. It raises a concern of potential reduced protection against re-infection and by vaccines designed to target the spike protein of earlier SARS-CoV-2 variants.","Cele, S.; Gazy, I.; Jackson, L.; Hwa, S.-H.; Tegally, H.; Lustig, G.; Giandhari, J.; Pillay, S.; Wilkinson, E.; Naidoo, Y.; Karim, F.; Ganga, Y.; Khan, K.; Balazs, A.

This study was designed to examine the effect of this unique time on artistic voice users, the way they perceive their voice and their voice-related behaviors. METHODS: A total of 110 participants volunteered for the study: 57 professional artistic voice users (34 singers and 19 actors) and a control group of 53 nonprofessional voice users. All participants completed three questionnaires related to their self-assessment of their voice, their voice difficulties, vocal training, and current stress in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Compared to the controls, artistic voice users were more concerned about their voice (P < 0.001), practiced their voice more often (P < 0.001), and experienced more anxiety and stress (P < 0.05). In addition, within the professional group, singers reported practicing their voice in the time of the COVID-19 significantly more than actors (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Professional artistic voice users experience the COVID-19 pandemic as a stressful time, with negative effects on their well-being and specifically on their voice. This should be considered in the treatment and maintenance of their voice and professional career at current and future stressful times.","Primov-Fever, Adi; Roziner, Ilan; Amir, Ofer",J Voice,566,1

Yet, effective air quality management is hindered by limited data. We deployed robust, low-cost and low-power devices in a large-scale measurement campaign and characterized within-city variations in fine particulate matter (PM(2.5)) and black carbon (BC) pollution in Accra, Ghana. Between April 2019 and June 2020, we measured weekly gravimetric (filter-based) and minute-by-minute PM(2.5) concentrations at 146 unique locations, comprising of 10 fixed (∼1 year) and 136 rotating (7 day) sites covering a range of land-use and source influences. Filters were weighed for mass, and light absorbance (10(−5)m(−1)) of the filters was used as proxy for BC concentration. Year-long data at four fixed sites that were monitored in a previous study (2006–2007) were compared to assess changes in PM(2.5) concentrations. The mean annual PM(2.5) across the fixed sites ranged from 26 μg m(−3) at a peri-urban site to 43 μg m(−3) at a commercial, business, and industrial (CBI) site. CBI areas had the highest PM(2.5) levels (mean: 37 μg m(−3)), followed by high-density residential neighborhoods (mean: 36 μg m(−3)), while peri-urban areas recorded the lowest (mean: 26 μg m(−3)). Both PM(2.5) and BC levels were highest during the dry dusty Harmattan period (mean PM(2.5): 89 μg m(−3)) compared to non-Harmattan season (mean PM(2.5): 23 μg m(−3)). PM(2.5) at all sites peaked at dawn and dusk, coinciding with morning and evening heavy traffic. We found about a 50% reduction (71 vs 37 μg m(−3)) in mean annual PM(2.5) concentrations when compared to measurements in 2006–2007 in Accra. Ambient PM(2.5) concentrations in Accra may have plateaued at levels lower than those seen in large Asian megacities. However, levels are still 2- to 4-fold higher than the WHO guideline. Effective and equitable policies are needed to reduce pollution levels and protect public health.","Alli, Abosede S; Clark, Sierra N; Hughes, Allison; Nimo, James; Bedford-Moses, Josephine; Baah, Solomon; Wang, Jiayuan; Vallarino, Jose; Agyemang, Ernest; Barratt, Benjamin; Beddows, Andrew; Kelly, Frank; Owusu, George; Baumgartner, Jill; Brauer, Michael; Ezzati, Majid; Agyei-Mensah, Samuel; Arku, Raphael E",Environ Res Lett,566,1

A preregistered experiment (n = 925) further indicates that a voluntary policy would likely lead to insufficient compliance, would be perceived as less fair, and could intensify stigmatization. A mandatory policy appears to be an effective, fair, and socially responsible solution to curb transmissions of airborne viruses.","Betsch, Cornelia; Korn, Lars; Sprengholz, Philipp; Felgendreff, Lisa; Eitze, Sarah; Schmid, Philipp; Böhm, Robert",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,566,16

In this present study, the PfSNP-LAMP-LFD was validated on 128 clinical malaria samples of broad ranged parasite densities (10 to 87,634 parasites per microliter of blood). The results showed 100% accuracy for the detection of single nucleotide polymorphism for N51I mutation. Indeed, the high prevalence of N51I in the Pfdhfr-ts gene detected in the clinical samples is in line with reports of widespread antifolate resistant P. falciparum in Thailand. The relationship between enzyme choice and reaction time was observed to have an effect on PfSNP-LAMP-LFD specificity; however, the method yielded consistent results once the conditions have been optimized. The results demonstrate that PfSNP-LAMP-LFD is a simple method with sufficient sensitivity and specificity to be deployed in routine surveillance of antifolate resistance molecular marker and inform antimalarial management policy.","Yongkiettrakul, Suganya; Kolié, Fassou René; Kongkasuriyachai, Darin; Sattabongkot, Jetsumon; Nguitragool, Wang; Nawattanapaibool, Namfon; Suansomjit, Chayanut; Warit, Saradee; Kangwanrangsan, Niwat; Buates, Sureemas",Diagnostics (Basel),566,16

Their main microbicidal mechanisms are degranulation, phagocytosis, cytokine secretion and the formation of extracellular traps. Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are a microbicidal mechanism that involves neutrophil death. Since their discovery, in vitro and in vivo neutrophils have been challenged with a range of stimuli capable of inducing or inhibiting NET formation, with the objective to understand its function and regulation in health and disease. These networks composed of DNA and granular components are capable of immobilizing and killing pathogens. They comprise enzymes such as myeloperoxidase, elastase, cathepsin G, acid hydrolases and cationic peptides, all with antimicrobial and antifungal activity.
