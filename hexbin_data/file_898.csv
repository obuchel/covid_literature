Background: In the context of the pandemic, hospitals must be able to care for COVID-19 patients within a very short timeframe. OBJECTIVE Description of the setting up of a cohort ward for patients with COVID-19 on a surgical ward including the development of the nursing team. METHODS The intrinsic retrospective case study describes the situation, identifies special phenomena in a reflective manner and links them to existing knowledge. Data were anecdotal, routine data were collected in the context of nursing practice development. RESULTS Setting up the cohort ward in a Swiss hospital consisted of structural and technical planning, infection control measures, the establishment of interprofessional structures, and internal communication. During the four-week operation, 71 patients were treated. The use of practice development methodology initiated a cultural change. The reflection describes a field of tension between ""dream and distress"": As a dream, the lived experience of optimal care, with well-functioning processes, sufficient material, sufficient personnel and a very good interprofessional cooperation was evaluated. Distress in the form of high infection rates as well as psychological and physical stress did not occur. After the cohort ward was closed, there was a risk working back in normal operations based on existing economical and organizational conditions, with the knowledge that a different cooperation and organization is possible. CONCLUSIONS Positive experiences from the ""crisis mode"" should be used to further develop essential operations during normal times.","Rabes, Clemens; Bläuer, Cornelia; Büche, Volker; Gisler Ries, Isabelle; Knüppel Lauener, Susanne; Kuehl, Richard; Osthoff, Michael; Pfeiffer, Marlen; Probst, Silvia; Todorov, Victor; Panfil, Eva-Maria",Pflege,898,17

In a prospective, randomized study, we compared the long-term results of 2 operative techniques (osteotomy fixation versus no fixation) and 2 postoperative regimens (a soft cast versus an elastic bandage) in 100 patients who underwent surgery for hallux valgus. Clinical evaluations with the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) scale scoring were performed at baseline and 6 weeks, 6 months, 1 year, and a mean of 7.9 years postoperatively. The mean AOFAS function score were better in the group treated without osteotomy fixation and with an elastic bandage at 6 weeks postoperatively, but the differences then disappeared. The total AOFAS scores improved significantly in all 4 subgroups during the first 12 months; however, in the long term, some deterioration occurred. In the AOFAS scores, the average function, alignment, and total points were significantly worse when the preoperative hallux valgus angles exceeded 30°. The incidence of complication was low (1%); there was 1 superficial wound infection. The AOFAS score did not differ statistically among the groups in our population.

The aim of this study was to describe our initial experience with LESS adrenalectomy for benign adrenal tumors, focusing the attention about cosmetic satisfaction and reduction of postoperative pain. METHODS Medical records of consecutive patients undergoing LESS adrenalectomy were analyzed. All procedures were performed through a single multichannel port. Demographic and operative data were assessed. A visual analog scale (VAS) was used with a 10-point scale for an objective assessment of incisional pain and incisional cosmesis. RESULTS Between January 2010 and July 2012, 14 consecutive patients with benign adrenal tumors underwent LESS adrenalectomies. Of the planned LESS adrenalectomies, 12 (86%) were completed with a single-port, whereas two required an additional port placement. Mean operating time was 128.1 ± 31.5 min and mean blood loss 10.5 ± 12.1 ml. Mean pain scores using the VAS on postoperative days 1, 3, and 14 were 2.3, 1.0, and 0.3 points, respectively. The rate of analgesic use was also lower within 12 hours after surgery (14%). The patient was highly satisfied with the single small wound procedure, and mean cosmesis scores of postoperative days 3 and 14 were 9.4 and 9.8 points, respectively. The postoperative course was uneventful with no morbidity within one month of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS LESS adrenalectomy is a safe and technically feasible procedure for patients with benign adrenal tumors, and offers cosmetic benefit and the potential for postoperative pain reduction. However, surgeons with lack of experience as LESS surgery should be comprehended that the assistance of the needlescopic instrument does not compromise the cosmetic outcomes for difficult cases and the obese patients may not always be suitable candidates for pure LESS technique.","Sasaki, Akira; Nitta, Hiroyuki; Otsuka, Koki; Nishizuka, Satoshi; Baba, Shigeaki; Umemura, Akira; Koeda, Keisuke; Mizuno, Masaru; Wakabayashi, Go",BMC urology,898,1

There are significant knowledge gaps in the epidemiology, transmission dynamics, investigation tools and management. In this article, we review the available evidence about this disease. Every decade has witnessed the evolution of a new coronavirus epidemic since the last three decades. The varying transmission patterns, namely, nosocomial transmission and spread through mildly symptomatic cases is an area of concern. There is a spectrum of clinical features from mild to severe life threatening disease with major complications like severe pneumonia, ARDS, acute cardiac injury and septic shock. Presence of bilateral ground glass opacity and consolidation on imaging in appropriate clinical background should raise a suspicion about COVID 19. Poor prognostic factors include Multilobular infiltration on chest imaging, Lymphopenia, Bacterial co-infection, Smoking history, Chronic medical conditions like Hypertension and age >60 years (MuLBSTA score). Diagnosis is confirmed with PCR based testing of appropriate respiratory samples. Management is primarily supportive, with newer antivirals (lopinavir ritonavir and Remdesivir) under investigation. Role of steroids is still inconclusive. Standard infection control and prevention techniques should be followed. Vigilant screening of suspected cases and their contacts is important. Isolation of symptomatic cases and home quarantine of asymptomatic contacts is recommended.

This paper analyzed the published evidence for assessing the effect of COVID-19 on neonatal health and health care. Online published literature was searched from PubMed, Google Scholar, and other official webpages using keywords: ""coronavirus/COVID-19/new coronavirus 2019""/SARS-CoV-2 and neonatal health/care/outcomes"" and reviewed to prepare this article. COVID-19 is the potential to transmit either mother to fetus or mother/caregiver to neonates. However, neonates born from infected mothers did not show significant clinical features. Pharyngeal-swab, amniotic-fluid, cord-blood, and breast-milk test results were not found positive. Health facility-based vaginal/caesarian delivery was considered a low risk of transmission. However, recommended to separate neonates with infected mothers/caregivers and test immediately after birth to avoid the possible transmission. Mothers/caregivers should take routine preventive measures such as washing hands frequently and avoiding contact with infected people. If neonates suffered from the server acute respiratory distress requires intensive care urgently. Despite the possibility of the intrauterine transmission of COVID-19 direct evidence is still lacking so it needs more studies for further confirmation.

Arginase I (ARG1) and arginase II (ARG2) compete with NO synthases for their common substrate L-arginine, therefore influencing the NO formation. We examined here whether ARG1 and ARG2 genotypes and haplotypes affect the changes in blood pressure and NO bioavailability in response to propofol. METHODS: Venous blood samples were collected from 167 patients at baseline and after 10 min of anesthesia with propofol. Genotypes were determined by polymerase chain reaction. Nitrite concentrations were measured by using an ozone-based chemiluminescence assay, while NOx (nitrites + nitrates) levels were determined by using the Griess reaction. RESULTS: We found that patients carrying the AG + GG genotypes for the rs3742879 polymorphism in ARG2 gene and the ARG2 GC haplotype show lower increases in nitrite levels and lower decreases in blood pressure after propofol anesthesia. On the other hand, subjects carrying the variant genotypes for the rs10483801 polymorphism in ARG2 gene show more intense decreases in blood pressure (CA genotype) and/or higher increases in nitrite levels (CA and AA genotypes) in response to propofol. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that ARG2 variants affect the hypotensive responses to propofol, possibly by modifying NO bioavailability.

A total of 57 highly networked T-cell epitopes that are conserved across geographic viral variants were identified from these viral proteins, with a binding potential to diverse HLA alleles and 80 to 100% global population coverage. Importantly, 18 of these T-cell epitope derived peptides had limited homology to seasonal human coronaviruses making them promising candidates for SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell immunity assays.

Our immunoinformatics analysis revealed that 18 of these peptides had limited homology to circulating seasonal human coronaviruses and therefore are promising candidates for distinguishing SARS-CoV-2-specific immune responses from pre-existing coronavirus immunity. Importantly, CD8+ T cells derived from SARS-CoV-2 survivors exhibited polyfunctional effector responses to two novel NC-derived peptides identified as HLA-binders.

Together, residents and staff constitute the single most vulnerable population in the pandemic. The health of these workers is completely entangled with the health of those they care for. Vaccination of SNF staff is key to increasing uptake of the vaccine, reducing health disparities, and reopening SNFs to visitors. Yet, as the vaccine rollout begins, some SNF staff are declining to be vaccinated. The purpose of this article is to describe reasons for COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy reported by staff of skilled nursing facilities and understand factors that could potentially reduce hesitancy. DESIGN: Five virtual focus groups were conducted with staff of SNFs as part of a larger project to improve vaccine uptake. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Focus groups with 58 staff members were conducted virtually using Zoom. MEASURES: Focus groups sought to elicit concerns, perspectives, and experiences related to COVID-19 testing and vaccination. RESULTS: Our findings indicate that some SNF staff are hesitant to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Reasons for this hesitancy include beliefs that the vaccine has been developed too fast and without sufficient testing; personal fears about pre-existing medical conditions, and more general distrust of the government. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: SNF staff indicate that seeing people like themselves receive the vaccination is more important than seeing public figures. We discuss the vaccination effort as a social enterprise and the need to develop long-term care provider-academic-community partnerships in response to COVID-19 and in expectation of future pandemics.","Harrison, Jill; Berry, Sarah; Mor, Vince; Gifford, David",J.

Activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) contributes to avid sodium retention, cardiac hypertrophy and oedema formation, including lung congestion. While the status of the classic components of RAAS such as renin, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), angiotensin II (Ang II) and angiotensin II receptor AT-1 is well studied in CHF, the expression of angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), a key enzyme of angiotensin 1-7 (Ang 1-7) generation in the pulmonary, cardiac and renal systems has not been studied thoroughly in this clinical setting. This issue is of a special interest as Ang 1-7 counterbalance the vasoconstrictory, pro-inflammatory and pro-proliferative actions of Ang II. Furthermore, CHF predisposes to COVID-19 disease severity, while ACE2 also serves as the binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 in human host-cells, and acts in concert with furin, an important enzyme in the synthesis of BNP in CHF, in permeating viral functionality along TMPRSST2. ADAM17 governs ACE2 shedding from cell membranes. Therefore, the present study was designed to investigate the expression of ACE2, furin, TMPRSS2 and ADAM17 in the lung, heart and kidneys of rats with CHF to understand the exaggerated susceptibility of clinical CHF to COVID-19 disease. Heart failure was induced in male Sprague Dawley rats by the creation of a surgical aorto-caval fistula. Sham-operated rats served as controls. One week after surgery, the animals were subdivided into compensated and decompensated CHF according to urinary sodium excretion. Both groups and their controls were sacrificed, and their hearts, lungs and kidneys were harvested for assessment of tissue remodelling and ACE2, furin, TMPRSS2 and ADAM17 immunoreactivity, expression and immunohistochemical staining. ACE2 immunoreactivity and mRNA levels increased in pulmonary, cardiac and renal tissues of compensated, but not in decompensated CHF. Furin immunoreactivity was increased in both compensated and decompensated CHF in the pulmonary, cardiac tissues and renal cortex but not in the medulla. Interestingly, both the expression and abundance of pulmonary, cardiac and renal TMPRSS2 decreased in CHF in correlation with the severity of the disease. Pulmonary, cardiac and renal ADAM17 mRNA levels were also downregulated in decompensated CHF. Circulating furin levels increased in proportion to CHF severity, whereas plasma ACE2 remained unchanged. In summary, ACE2 and furin are overexpressed in the pulmonary, cardiac and renal tissues of compensated and to a lesser extent of decompensated CHF as compared with their sham controls. The increased expression of the ACE2 in heart failure may serve as a compensatory mechanism, counterbalancing the over-activity of the deleterious isoform, ACE. Downregulated ADAM17 might enhance membranal ACE2 in COVID-19 disease, whereas the suppression of TMPRSS2 in CHF argues against its involvement in the exaggerated susceptibility of CHF patients to SARS-CoV2.","Khoury, Emad E; Knaney, Yara; Fokra, Ahmad; Kinaneh, Safa; Azzam, Zaher; Heyman, Samuel N; Abassi, Zaid",J Cell Mol Med,898,16

The first was disseminated by the Italian National Institute of Health (ISS) and the second, which is more usable due to the lower difficulty of calculation and the availability of data, was adopted by various regional and local institutions.The rationale for the Rt index refers to that for the R0 index, the basic reproduction number, which is used by infectivologists as a measure of contagiousness of a given infectious agent in a completely susceptible population. The RDt index, on the other hand, is borrowed from the techniques of time series analysis for the trend of an event measurement that develops as a function of time. The RDt index does not take into account the time of infection, but the date of the diagnosis of positivity and for this reason it is defined as diagnostic replication index, as it aims to describe the intensity of the development of frequency for cases recognized as positive in the population.The comparison between different possible applications of the methods and the use of different types of monitoring data was limited to four areas for which complete individual data were available in March and April 2020. The main problems in the use of Rt, which is based on the date of symptoms onset, arise from the lack of completeness of this information due both to the difficulty in the recording and to the absence in asymptomatic subjects.The general trend of RDt, at least at an intermediate lag of 6 or 7 days, is very similar to that of Rt, as confirmed by the very high value of the correlation index between the two indices. The maximum correlation between Rt and RDt is reached at lag 7 with a value of R exceeding 0.97 (R2=0.944).The two indices, albeit formally distinct, are both valid; they show specific aspects of the phenomenon, but provide basically similar information to the public health decision-maker. Their distinction lies not so much in the method of calculation, rather in the use of different information, i.e., the beginning of symptoms and the swabs outcome.Therefore, it is not appropriate to make a judgment of preference for one of the two indices, but only to invite people to understand their different potentials so that they can choose the one they consider the most appropriate for the purpose they want to use it for.","Giraudo, Maria Teresa; Falcone, Manuele; Cadum, Ennio; Deandrea, Silvia; Scondotto, Salvatore; Mattaliano, Andrea; Di Pietrantonj, Carlo; Bisceglia, Lucia; Duca, Piergiorgio; Cislaghi, Cesare",Epidemiol Prev,898,24

The disease primarily affects the lower respiratory system, but may involve other organs and systems. Histopathologic evaluation of tissue from affected patients is crucial for diagnostic purposes, but also for advancing our understanding of the disease. For that reason, we developed immunohistochemical (IHC) and in situ hybridization (ISH) assays for detection of the. virus. A total of eight autopsy lungs, one placenta, and ten kidney biopsies from COVID-19 patients were stained with a panel of commercially available antibodies for IHC and commercially available RNA probes for ISH. Similarly, autopsy lungs, placentas and renal biopsies from non-COVID-19 patients were stained with the same antibodies and probes. All eight lungs and the placenta from COVID-19 patients stained positive by IHC and ISH, while the kidney biopsies stained negative by both methodologies. As expected, all specimens from non-COVID-19 patients were IHC and ISH negative. These two assays represent a sensitive and specific method for detecting the virus in tissue samples. We provide the protocols and the list of commercially available antibodies and probes for these assays, so they can be readily implemented in pathology laboratories and medical examiner offices for diagnostic and research purposes.","Best Rocha, Alejandro; Stroberg, Edana; Barton, Lisa M; Duval, Eric J; Mukhopadhyay, Sanjay; Yarid, Nicole; Caza, Tiffany; Wilson, Jon D; Kenan, Daniel J; Kuperman, Michael; Sharma, Shree G; Larsen, Christopher P",Lab Invest,898,21

As of August 22, 2020, the pandemic infected more than 23,329,752 including 807,054 patients who have died. Although the main clinical features of the pandemic disease are respiratory, cerebrovascular comorbidities emerged as one of the leading causes of death associated with COVID-19. Different case reports have indicated that C-reactive protein (CRP) and D-dimer (pro-inflammatory biomarkers) were elevated in COVID-19 patients, which can significantly increase the risk of ischemic stroke. Available data on cerebrovascular complications in COVID-19 patients were collected and a meta-analysis was designed and carried out to evaluate the risk of severity and mortality associated with high levels of CRP and D-dimer levels in COVID-19 patients. In addition, we aimed to describe the overall event rate of pre-existing cerebrovascular disease in COVID-19 patients. In our analysis, 5,614 cases have been studied, out of these patients 164 cases have developed cerebrovascular comorbities. Cerebrovascular comorbidity increased the risk of disease severity (odd ratioâ=â4.4; 95% CI: 1.48 to 12.84) and mortality (odd ratioâ=â7.0; 95% CI: 2.56 to 18.99). Statistical analyses showed that CRP and D-dimer serum levels were elevated by six-folds in the severe cases of COVID-19 patients. This significant increase in these two proteins levels can serve as a vital indicator for COVID-19 patients who are at increased risk of severe COVID-19 cerebrovascular complications, such as stroke.","Alzoughool, Foad; Alanagreh, Lo039; ai,; Abumweis, Suhad; Atoum, Manar",,898,22

In response to these challenges, a new virtual introduction to radiology elective was established with unique online resources and curriculum. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A previously in-person 2-week introductory radiology elective was converted into a completely virtual experience using an internally developed, open-source, peer-reviewed, web-based teaching modules combined with virtual lectures, interdisciplinary conferences, and readout sessions of de-identified cases loaded to a DICOM viewer. Students from the first four months of course enrollment completed a multiple choice pre- and post-course knowledge assessments and a 5-point Likert Scale survey as part of their educational experience. RESULTS: In total, 26 4th-year medical students participated over 4 separate 2-week sessions from July to October of 2020. This included 12 students from the home intuition and 14 visiting students. On average, students scored 62.2% on the 55-question pre-test and 89.0% on the same test upon completion of the course, a statistically significant increase (p < 0.001). All 26 students felt engaged throughout the course. All 26 agreed (23 ""strongly agreed"") that they were more comfortable looking at imaging studies following the course. All 26 also agreed (21 ""strongly agreed"") that the course helped them prepare for their future clinical rotations and careers. CONCLUSION: Initial pilot program using unique web-based resources and student encounters during a two-week virtual introductory radiology elective proved to be a positive educational experience for the first 26 students enrolled.","Belfi, Lily M; Dean, Kathryn E; Bartolotta, Roger J; Shih, George; Min, Robert J",Clin Imaging,898,16

This study aims to assess whether IL-10, IL-1ß, IL-6, MCP-1, TNF-&#945;, IP-10 and IL-4 serve as potential diagnostic biomarkers of COVID-19. METHODS: The above serum cytokines in COVID-19 patients and non-COVID-19 patients were detected by ELISA and SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG were detected by the chemiluminescence method. The independent-sample Mann-Whitney U test was utilised to compare cytokine levels in different groups and courses, the Levene T-test and T'-test were utilised to compare they in different genders and the Spearman correlation test was utilised to analyse the correlation between the cytokine levels with ages and SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM. RESULTS: Serum levels of IL-10, IL-1ß, MCP-1, TNF-&#945; and IL-4 in COVID-19 patients were significantly higher than those in non-COVID-19 patients, while IL-6 were only significantly higher than in healthy people, IP-10 were significantly lower than in other diseases patients. AUCs of COVID-19 diagnosed by IL-10, IL-1ß, IL-6, MCP-1, TNF-&#945;, IP-10 and IL-4 were 0.735, 0.775, 0.595, 0.821, 0.848, 0.38 and 0.682, respectively. In the COVID-19 patients' serum, the levels of IL-10 and MCP-1 of male were noticeably higher than those of female, and all cytokines were significantly positively correlated with age, IL-1ß and IL-4 were significantly negatively correlated with SARS-CoV-2 IgM, while IL-10, IL-1ß, IL-6, TNF- and IP-10 were significantly negatively correlated with SARS-CoV-2 IgG. IL-10 on 43-56 days was significantly lower than at 29-42 days, TNF-&#945; at 15-42 days was significantly higher than at 0-14 days, IP-10 at 0-14 days was the highest and IL-4 at 29-42 days was significantly higher than at 0-14 days. CONCLUSIONS: The detection of IL-10, IL-1 ß, IL-6, MCP-1, TNF-&#945; and IL-4 would assist the clinical study of COVID-19, and IP-10 may be the cytokine of early elevation in COVID-19 patients.","Lu, Qingqing; Zhu, Zhenhua; Tan, Chaochao; Zhou, Hui; Hu, Yan; Shen, Ge; Zhu, Pan; Yang, Gang; Xie, Xiaobing",Int J Clin Pract,898,16

Since their discovery in the late 1970's, DCs have been recognized as the most potent antigen-presenting cells (APCs). DCs have a superior capacity for acquiring, processing, and presenting antigens to T cells and they express costimulatory or coinhibitory molecules that determine immune activation or anergy. For these reasons, cell-based therapeutic approaches using DCs have been explored in cancer and infectious diseases but with limited success. In humans, DCs are divided into heterogeneous subsets with distinct characteristics. Two major subsets are CD11c+ myeloid (m)DCs and CD11c- plasmacytoid (p)DCs. pDCs are different from mDCs and play an essential role in the innate immune system via the production of type I interferons (IFN). However, pDCs are also able to take-up antigens and effectively cross present them. Given the rarity of pDCs in blood and technical difficulties in obtaining them from human blood samples, the understanding of human pDC biology and their potential in immunotherapeutic approaches (e.g. cell-based vaccines) is limited. However, due to the recent advancements in cell culturing systems that allow for the generation of functional pDCs from CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC), studying pDCs has become easier. In this mini-review, we hypothesize about the use of pDCs as a cell-based therapy to treat HIV by enhancing anti-HIV-immune responses of the adaptive immune system and enhancing the anti-viral responses of the innate immune system. Additionally, we discuss obstacles to overcome before this approach becomes clinically applicable.","van der Sluis, Renée M; Egedal, Johanne H; Jakobsen, Martin R",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,898,9

Herein, we analyzed the placentas of 31 coronavirus disease 2019-positive mothers by reverse transcriptase PCR, immunohistochemistry, and in situ hybridization. We only detected one case of placental infection, which was associated with intrauterine demise of the fetus. We then isolated and differentiated primary trophoblasts from nonpathologic human placentas at term, and exposed them to SARS-CoV-2 virions. Unlike for positive control cells Vero E6, we were not able to detect the virus inside cytotrophoblasts and syncytiotrophoblasts or in the supernatant 4 days after infection. As a mechanism of defense, we hypothesized that trophoblasts at term do not express angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), the two main host membrane receptors for SARS-CoV-2 entry. The quantification of these proteins in the placenta during pregnancy confirmed the absence of TMPRSS2 at the surface of the syncytium. Surprisingly, a transiently induced experimental expression of TMPRSS2 did not allow the entry or replication of the virus in differentiated trophoblasts. Altogether, these results underline that trophoblasts are not likely to be infected by SARS-CoV-2 at term, but the reported case raises concern about preterm infection.","Colson, Arthur; Depoix, Christophe L; Dessilly, Géraldine; Baldin, Pamela; Danhaive, Olivier; Hubinont, Corinne; Sonveaux, Pierre; Debiève, Frédéric",Am. j. pathol,898,22

Thyroid hormones play a key role in modulating metabolism and the immune system. However, the prevalence of thyroid dysfunction (TD) and its association with the prognosis of COVID-19 have not yet been elucidated. In this study, we seek to address this gap and understand the link between TD and COVID-19. METHODS: Herein, we enrolled patients who were hospitalised with COVID-19 and had normal or abnormal thyroid function test results at the West Court of Union Hospital in Wuhan, China, between 29 January and 26 February 2020. We carried out follow up examinations until 26 April 2020. Data on clinical features, treatment strategies, and prognosis were collected and analysed. TD was defined as an abnormal thyroid function test result, including overt thyrotoxicosis, overt hypothyroidism, subclinical hypothyroidism, subclinical hyperthyroidism, and euthyroid sick syndrome. RESULTS: A total of 25 and 46 COVID-19 patients with and without TD, respectively, were included in the study. COVID-19 patients with TD had significantly higher neutrophil counts and higher levels of C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, lactate dehydrogenase, serum creatine kinase, aspartate transaminase, and high-sensitive troponin I and a longer activated partial thromboplastin time but lower lymphocyte, platelet, and eosinophil counts. A longitudinal analysis of serum biomarkers showed that patients with TD presented persistently high levels of biomarkers for inflammatory response and cardiac injury. COVID-19 patients with TD were more likely to develop a critical subtype of the disease. Patients with TD had a significantly higher fatality rate than did those without TD during hospitalisation (20% vs 0%, P<0.0001). Patients with TD were more likely to stay in the hospital for more than 28 days than were those without TD (80% vs 56.52%, P=0.048). CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary findings suggest that TD is associated with poor outcomes in patients with COVID-19.","Zhang, Yan; Lin, Fengyu; Tu, Wei; Zhang, Jianchu; Choudhry, Abira Afzal; Ahmed, Omair; Cheng, Jun; Cui, Yanhui; Liu, Ben; Dai, Minhui; Chen, Lingli; Han, Duoduo; Fan, Yifei; Zeng, Yanjun; Li, Wen; Li, Sha; Chen, Xiang; Shen, Minxue; Pan, Pinhua",Mol Cell Endocrinol,898,29

Teams working in these emergency services experience a heavy workload and have a limited amount of time with each patient. COVID-19 has further complicated these existing issues. Therefore, we believed it would be helpful to draft an abridged version of the 40-item WCSHES, considering both validity and reliability criteria, but giving greater weight to validity. One hundred and twenty-six workers between the ages of 20 to 64 (M = 32.45; standard deviation (SD = 9.73)) years old participated voluntarily in the study. The validity, reliability, and fit model were evaluated in an iterative process.
