The clinical and epidemiologic features of these patients were analyzed and compared with patients with diarrhea who were shedding rotaviruses, or whose stools were negative for enteric viruses by EM. Seasonal and age distributions for CVLP shedding were similar to those for rotaviruses (in most cases less than 1 year of age; peak months were September through January), as were the symptoms and median durations of illness. Prospective studies of three subsequent patients suggest that the duration of shedding in acute illness is five to at least 25 days. Multiple attempts to cultivate the CVLPs were unsuccessful. In addition, partial purification of CVLPs from stool specimens was performed, and immunologic analysis by immunoelectron microscopy and radial immunodiffusion showed no antigenic relatedness to prototype human (OC43 and 229E) or animal (bovine and canine) coronaviruses. These findings suggest that CVLPs may be an important cause of acute gastrointestinal illness in infancy, and may represent a virus antigenically unrelated to known human and animal coronaviruses.","Mortensen, M L; Ray, C G; Payne, C M; Friedman, A D; Minnich, L L; Rousseau, C",American journal of diseases of children,901,9

This disease poses an extraordinary challenge for public health systems because screening and surveillance capacity is often severely limited, especially during the beginning of the outbreak; this can fuel the outbreak, as many patients can unknowingly infect other people. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to collect and analyze posts related to COVID-19 on Weibo, a popular Twitter-like social media site in China. To our knowledge, this infoveillance study employs the largest, most comprehensive, and most fine-grained social media data to date to predict COVID-19 case counts in mainland China. METHODS: We built a Weibo user pool of 250 million people, approximately half the entire monthly active Weibo user population. Using a comprehensive list of 167 keywords, we retrieved and analyzed around 15 million COVID-19-related posts from our user pool from November 1, 2019 to March 31, 2020. We developed a machine learning classifier to identify ""sick posts,"" in which users report their own or other people's symptoms and diagnoses related to COVID-19. Using officially reported case counts as the outcome, we then estimated the Granger causality of sick posts and other COVID-19 posts on daily case counts. For a subset of geotagged posts (3.10% of all retrieved posts), we also ran separate predictive models for Hubei province, the epicenter of the initial outbreak, and the rest of mainland China. RESULTS: We found that reports of symptoms and diagnosis of COVID-19 significantly predicted daily case counts up to 14 days ahead of official statistics, whereas other COVID-19 posts did not have similar predictive power. For the subset of geotagged posts, we found that the predictive pattern held true for both Hubei province and the rest of mainland China regardless of the unequal distribution of health care resources and the outbreak timeline. CONCLUSIONS: Public social media data can be usefully harnessed to predict infection cases and inform timely responses. Researchers and disease control agencies should pay close attention to the social media infosphere regarding COVID-19. In addition to monitoring overall search and posting activities, leveraging machine learning approaches and theoretical understanding of information sharing behaviors is a promising approach to identify true disease signals and improve the effectiveness of infoveillance.","Shen, Cuihua; Chen, Anfan; Luo, Chen; Zhang, Jingwen; Feng, Bo; Liao, Wang",J Med Internet Res,901,29
