Living a long life is not any more as challenging as assuring active and associated life [25]. We propose in this paper an IoT based holistic remote health monitoring system for chronically ill and elderly patients. It supports smart clinical decision help and prediction. The patient heterogeneous vital signs and contexts gathered from wore and surrounding sensors are semantically simplified and modeled via a validated ontology composed by FOAF (Friend of a Friend), SSN (Semantic Sensors Network)/SOSA (Sensor, Observation, Sample and Actuator) and ICNP (International Classification Nursing Practices) ontologies. The reasoner engine is based on a scalable set of inference rules cohesively integrated with a ML (Machine Learning) algorithm to ensure predictive analytic and preventive personalized health services. Experimental results prove the efficiency of the proposed system.","Henaien, Amira; Ben Elhadj, Hadda; Chaari Fourati, Lamia",The Impact of Digital Technologies on Public Health in Developed and Developing Countries,774,0

However, outsourcing patient’s sensitive data increases the concerns regarding security, privacy, and integrity of healthcare data. Therefore, there is a need for building a trust relationship between patients and e-health systems. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving framework, called Hybrid and Secure Data Sharing Architecture (HSDSA), to secure data storage in e-health systems. Our approach improves security in healthcare by maintaining the privacy and confidentiality of sensitive data and preventing threats. In fact, in the upload phase, Multi-cloud environment is used to store Rivest–Shamir–Adleman (RSA) encrypted medical records. We adopt a Shamir’s secret sharing approach for the distribution of shares to different independent cloud providers. In the retrieval phase, the reconstruction operation is based on the (t, n) strategy. To check the requester identity and to prove the hash possession, we used a zero-knowledge cryptography algorithm, namely the Schnorr algorithm. The patient has a total control over the generation and management of the decryption keys using Diffie-Hellman algorithm without relying on a trusted authority.","Ismail, Tayssir; Touati, Haifa; Hajlaoui, Nasreddine; Hamdi, Hassen",The Impact of Digital Technologies on Public Health in Developed and Developing Countries,774,0

The success of CDCL solvers is owed to the design of clever heuristics that enable the tight coupling of different components. One of the core components is phase selection, wherein the solver, during branching, decides the polarity of the branch to be explored for a given variable. Most of the state-of-the-art CDCL SAT solvers employ phase-saving as a phase selection heuristic, which was proposed to address the potential inefficiencies arising from far-backtracking. In light of the emergence of chronological backtracking in CDCL solvers, we re-examine the efficiency of phase saving. Our empirical evaluation leads to a surprising conclusion: The usage of saved phase and random selection of polarity for decisions following a chronological backtracking leads to an indistinguishable runtime performance in terms of instances solved and PAR-2 score. We introduce Decaying Polarity Score (DPS) to capture the trend of the polarities attained by the variable, and upon observing lack of performance improvement due to DPS, we turn to a more sophisticated heuristic seeking to capture the activity of literals and the trend of polarities: Literal State Independent Decaying Sum (LSIDS). We find the 2019 winning SAT solver, Maple_LCM_Dist_ChronoBTv3, augmented with LSIDS solves 6 more instances while achieving a reduction of over 125 seconds in PAR-2 score, a significant improvement in the context of the SAT competition.","Shaw, Arijit; Meel, Kuldeep S.",Theory and Applications of Satisfiability Testing - SAT 2020,774,0

Febrile seizures may occur following vaccination in patients with an appropriate genetic predisposition. The occurrence of narcolepsy has been described more frequently after pandemic influenza A-H1N1 vaccinations. The causality has not been proven. Data regarding an association between Guillain-Barré syndrome and influenza vaccinations are inconclusive. It was conclusively shown that vaccinations do not cause neurological disorders, such as autism and do not trigger multiple sclerosis. In summary, there is currently no confirmed evidence for the occurrence of chronic neurological diseases as a consequence of generally recommended vaccinations in Germany. If unusual neurological symptoms are observed in temporal association with vaccinations, a comprehensive evaluation is necessary to exclude a causal relationship and to diagnose the underlying neurological disease independent of the vaccination. This statement gives specific recommendations for the practical approach when neurological symptoms are observed in temporal association with vaccinations with respect to taking the patient history, initial diagnostic procedures, accurate and prompt documentation and the obligation to report the event. The committee also proposes procedures for further clarification and differential diagnostics of causal neurological diseases in childhood and adolescence.","Huppertz, Hans-Iko",Monatsschr Kinderheilkd,774,0

In this study, we evaluated the accuracy of the Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score (CPIS) to differentiate VAT and VAP. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis based on the data from 2 independent prospective cohorts. Patients of the TAVeM database with a diagnosis of VAT (n = 320) or VAP (n = 369) were included in the derivation cohort. Patients admitted to the Intensive Care Centre of Lille University Hospital between January 1, 2016 and December 31, 2017 who had a diagnosis of VAT (n = 70) or VAP (n = 139) were included in the validation cohort. The accuracy of the CPIS to differentiate VAT from VAP was assessed within the 2 cohorts by calculating sensitivity and specificity values, establishing the ROC curves and choosing the best threshold according to the Youden index. RESULTS: The areas under ROC curves of CPIS to differentiate VAT from VAP were calculated at 0.76 (95% CI [0.72–0.79]) in the derivation cohort and 0.67 (95% CI [0.6–0.75]) in the validation cohort. A CPIS value ≥ 7 was associated with the highest Youden index in both cohorts. With this cut-off, sensitivity and specificity were respectively found at 0.51 and 0.88 in the derivation cohort, and at 0.45 and 0.89 in the validation cohort. CONCLUSIONS: A CPIS value ≥ 7 reproducibly allowed to differentiate VAT from VAP with high specificity and PPV and moderate sensitivity and NPV in our derivation and validation cohorts.","Gaudet, Alexandre; Martin-Loeches, Ignacio; Povoa, Pedro; Rodriguez, Alejandro; Salluh, Jorge; Duhamel, Alain; Nseir, Saad",Ann Intensive Care,774,0

To better understand the mechanism of the neutralization activity against HCMV, the association of HCMV NT antibody titers was assessed with the antibody titers against each glycoprotein complex (gc) of HCMV. METHODS: Sera collected from 78 healthy adult volunteers were used. HCMV Merlin strain and HCMV clinical isolate strain 1612 were used in the NT assay with the plaque reduction assay, in which both the MRC-5 fibroblasts cells and the RPE-1 epithelial cells were used. Glycoprotein complex of gB, gH/gL complexes (gH/gL/gO and gH/gL/UL128–131A [PC]) and gM/gN were selected as target glycoproteins. 293FT cells expressed with gB, gM/gN, gH/gL/gO, or PC, were prepared and used for the measurement of the antibody titers against each gc in an indirect immunofluorescence assay (IIFA). The correlation between the IIFA titers to each gc and the HCMV-NT titers was evaluated. RESULTS: There were no significant correlations between gB-specific IIFA titers and the HCMV-NT titers in epithelial cells or between gM/gN complex-specific IIFA titers and the HCMV-NT titers. On the other hand, there was a statistically significant positive correlation between the IIFA titers to gH/gL complexes and HCMV-NT titers.

Our goals were to calculate LOS and charges attributable to BSI and compare results among different models. METHODS: A retrospective observational cohort study was conducted in 2017 in a large general hospital, in Beijing. Using patient-level data, we compared the attributable LOS and charges of BSI with three models: 1) conventional non-matching, 2) propensity score matching controlling for the impact of potential confounding variables, and 3) risk set matching controlling for time-varying covariates and matching based on propensity score and infection time. RESULTS: The study included 118,600 patient admissions, 557 (0.47%) with BSI. Six hundred fourteen microorganisms were cultured from patients with BSI. Escherichia coli was the most common bacteria (106, 17.26%). Among multi-drug resistant bacteria, carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) was the most common (42, 38.53%). In the conventional non-matching model, the excess LOS and charges associated with BSI were 25.06 days (P < 0.05) and US$22041.73 (P < 0.05), respectively. After matching, the mean LOS and charges attributable to BSI both decreased. When infection time was incorporated into the risk set matching model, the excess LOS and charges were 16.86 days (P < 0.05) and US$15909.21 (P < 0.05), respectively. CONCLUSION: This is the first study to consider time-dependent bias in estimating excess LOS and charges attributable to BSI in a Chinese hospital setting. We found matching on infection time can reduce bias.","Zhang, Yuzheng; Du, Mingmei; Johnston, Janice Mary; Andres, Ellie Bostwick; Suo, Jijiang; Yao, Hongwu; Huo, Rui; Liu, Yunxi; Fu, Qiang",Antimicrob Resist Infect Control,774,0

This calls for the exploration of an alternative therapy. MAIN BODY: The anti-uropathogenic and bactericidal activity of many plant extracts was reported by many researchers, which involves only preliminary antibacterial studies using different basic techniques like disk diffusion, agar well diffusion, or minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the crude plant extracts, but reports on the specific action of the phytoconstituents against uropathogens are limited. Vaccinium macrocarpon Aiton (cranberry) is the best-studied home remedy for UTI. Some evidences suggest that proanthocyanins present in cranberry, prevent bacteria from adhering to the walls of the urinary tract, subsequently blocking the further steps of uropathogenesis. Probiotics such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium are beneficial microorganisms that may act by the competitive exclusion principle to defend against infections in the urogenital tracts. Reports on potential vaccine agents and antibodies targeting the different toxins and effecter proteins are still obscure except uropathogenic E. coli. CONCLUSION: This review highlights some of the medicinal herbs used by aborigines to prevent or treat acute or chronic urinary tract infections, botanicals with established urobactericidal activity, clinical trials undertaken to compare the efficacy of cranberry products in UTI prevention, and other natural therapeutics reported for UTI.","Das, Sarita",Futur J Pharm Sci,774,0

OBJECTIVES: To determine prevalence of respiratory complications in individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI) during the initial rehabilitation at the spinal cord injury unit (SCU) and to describe the subsequent effect on mortality. SETTING: The SCU at the university hospital in Gothenburg, Sweden. METHODS: We reviewed the medical charts of newly injured persons with SCI who were admitted to the SCU between 1/1/2010 and 12/31/2014. Outcome measures were time to death, length of stay, occurrence of respiratory complications, and the use of breathing aids. RESULTS: A total of 136 consecutive individuals were included; 53% with cervical SCI and 20% with lower SCI suffered from one or several respiratory complications during their initial rehabilitation in the SCU. At follow-up, 10/1/2018, 20% of the individuals were deceased. The most common cause of death was related to respiratory insufficiency. The individuals with respiratory complications during the initial rehabilitation in the SCU had particularly shortened survival compared with those without. The relative risk (RR) of dying if the person suffered from any respiratory complications during their initial rehabilitation in the SCU was 2.1 times higher than for those with no respiratory complications (RR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.1–3.9). CONCLUSIONS: Having respiratory complications at the SCU provides preliminary data to support the claim that respiratory complications predict premature mortality. Early diagnosis and prophylactic measures seem to be necessary to mitigate the adverse consequences of serious respiratory problems.","Josefson, Charlotta; Rekand, Tiina; Lundgren-Nilsson, Åsa; Sunnerhagen, Katharina S.",Spinal Cord,774,0

Despite an increased demand, teaching on GH remains fragmented and heterogeneous in the university landscape in German-speaking countries. Moreover, there is a lack of common understanding of GH and interpretations range from GH as tropical medicine to GH as everything related to health. This project aims to develop (A) a framework of different GH concepts, as a basis for (B) a set of GH learning objectives for German-speaking countries. METHODS: A review of publications providing GH definitions was carried out. Following a concept analysis approach, we developed a general framework of different and partially overlapping GH understandings. Building on these results we conducted an overview of reviews on learning objectives and curricula for GH to develop a set of learning objectives. RESULTS: The general framework distinguishes between GH concepts describing GH as (1)a set of global health issues (e.g. COVID-19), (2) a global ideal to strive for, (3 + 4) any activities relating to said global health issues or ideals (e.g. all activities contributing to health equity), and (5) sets of activities meeting various characteristics (e.g. being transdisciplinary and transnational). Within each concept, multiple sets of axes allow a more granular distinction of the concepts (e.g. regarding the relation to public health and tropical medicine). The list of key learning objectives shows considerable overlap with widely accepted public health core competencies. Differences include e.g. a (stronger) emphasis on intercultural and interdisciplinary collaboration, globalisation and transnational determinants of health. CONCLUSIONS: A systematic reflection on commonalities and differences in the understanding of GH is important for a shared understanding. Based on the GH learning objectives we will develop core competencies for GH, including through an online survey of GH experts. KEY MESSAGES: The GH:ADT framework of global health concepts supports a systematic reflection on and recognition of the multi-dimensional nature of Global Health. The learning objectives identified in the GH:ADT project can be a valuable tool for curriculum development.","Stratil, J; Rehfuess, E A; Geffert, K",Eur J Public Health,774,0

Having a high PhA above 3.5 at the time of ICU admission was associated with lower in-hospital mortality (adjusted OR 0.42, p =.042), and a shorter duration of ICU stay (5.6 days vs. 9.8 days, p =.016) compared to those with a low PhA. Other indices measured by BIA were not significantly associated with outcomes of critical illnesses. Frailty (KMBI > 60) was associated with more mechanical ventilation days (2.3 days vs. 7.1 days; p =.018). CONCLUSION: Both PhA and frailty are important prognostic factors predicting the outcomes of critical illnesses. Low PhA scores were associated with increased mortality and a longer duration of ICU stay, and frailty was associated with more mechanical ventilation days.","Ko, S. J.; Cho, J.; Choi, S.

The Ibovespa index tripled its market value between a low point in January 2016 and its maximum in January 2020—by March 12, half those gains had been erased. Narratives about a bubble in Brazilian stocks before the global crash and its subsequent burst are plentiful in specialized media. In this paper, we explore this narrative from within the framework of strict local martingale financial bubbles. A key result in this literature states some financial asset price displays a bubble only if it follows a strict local martingale under the equivalent risk-neutral measure. A diffusion process is a strict local martingale if its volatility increases faster than linearly as its level grows. We first apply a nonparametric method to estimate the volatility function of Ibovespa daily prices, then fit a stochastic volatility model whose parameter values can discriminate the underlying price process as either a true martingale or a strict local martingale. Our results are negative towards the presence of a strict local martingale bubble in the Ibovespa index. Strict local martingale bubbles are related to a positive relationship between returns and volatility which does not seem present in the data at hand. We also performed a comparative analysis of the patterns found for the Ibovespa with the S&P500 index, spot Brent oil and gold prices.

There is no vaccine and treatment available. Complex immune escape strategies of African swine fever virus (ASFV) are crucial factors affecting immune prevention and vaccine development. MGF360 genes have been implicated in the modulation of the IFN-I response. The molecular mechanisms contributing to innate immunity are poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrated that ASFV MGF360-12L (MGF360 families 12L protein) significantly inhibited the mRNA transcription and promoter activity of IFN-β and NF-κB, accompanied by decreases of IRF3, STING, TBK1, ISG54, ISG56 and AP-1 mRNA transcription. Also, MGF360-12L might suppress the nuclear localization of p50 and p65 mediated by classical nuclear localization signal (NLS). Additionally, MGF360-12L could interact with KPNA2, KPNA3, and KPNA4, which interrupted the interaction between p65 and KPNA2, KPNA3, KPNA4. We further found that MGF360-12L could interfere with the NF-κB nuclear translocation by competitively inhibiting the interaction between NF-κB and nuclear transport proteins. These findings suggested that MGF360-12L could inhibit the IFN-I production by blocking the interaction of importin α and NF-κB signaling pathway, which might reveal a novel strategy for ASFV to escape the host innate immune response.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective, multicentric study, we analyzed brain MRI exams from 72 patients diagnosed with definite PML: 32 after natalizumab treatment, 20 after rituximab treatment, and 20 HIV patients. We compared T2- or FLAIR-weighted images, diffusion-weighted images, T2*-weighted images, and contrast enhancement features, as well as lesion distribution, especially gray matter involvement. RESULTS: The three PML entities affect U-fibers associated with low signal intensities on T2*-weighted sequences. Natalizumab-associated PML showed a punctuate microcystic appearance in or in the vicinity of the main PML lesions, a potential involvement of the cortex, and contrast enhancement. HIV and rituximab-associated PML showed only mild contrast enhancement, punctuate appearance, and cortical involvement. The CD4/CD8 ratio showed a trend to be higher in the natalizumab group, possibly mirroring a more efficient immune response. CONCLUSION: Imaging features of rituximab-associated PML are different from those of natalizumab-associated PML and are closer to those observed in HIV-associated PML. KEY POINTS: • Nowadays, PML is emerging as a complication of new effective therapies based on monoclonal antibodies. • Natalizumab-associated PML shows more inflammatory signs, a perivascular distribution “the milky way,” and more cortex involvement than rituximab- and HIV-associated PML. • MRI differences are probably related to higher levels of immunosuppression in HIV patients and those under rituximab therapy.","Alleg, Manel; Solis, Morgane; Baloglu, Seyyid; Cotton, François; Kerschen, Philippe; Bourre, Bertrand; Ahle, Guido; Pruvo, Jean-Pierre; Leclerc, Xavier; Vermersch, Patrick; Papeix, Caroline; Maillart, Élisabeth; Houillier, Caroline; Chabrot, Cécile Moluçon; Claise, Béatrice; Malak, Sandra; Martin-Blondel, Guillaume; Bonneville, Fabrice; Caulier, Alexis; Marolleau, Jean-Pierre; Bonnefoy, Jérôme Tamburini; Agape, Philippe; Kennel, Céline; Roussel, Xavier; Chauchet, Adrien; De Seze, Jérôme; Fafi-Kremer, Samira; Kremer, Stéphane",Eur Radiol,774,1

This systematic review aims to evaluate the association between PLR levels on admission and the severity of COVID-19 patients. A systematic literature search was done on 23 July 2020 to identify peer-reviewed studies, preprints, and grey literatures. Research articles comparing the PLR value on admission in adult patients with COVID-19 with varying degrees of severity were included in the analysis. The following keywords were used for the search: “COVID-19”, “PLR”, “severity”, and “mortality”. A total of seven studies were included in the meta-analysis, six of which were conducted in China. From a total of 998 participants included, 316 (31.7%) had severe diseases; and those in the severe group were generally older and had underlying diseases compared to the non-severe group. In comparison to non-severe patients, the meta-analysis showed that severe COVID-19 patients had higher PLR levels on admission (SMD 0.68; 95%CI 0.43-0.93; I(2) =58%). High PLR levels on admission were associated with severe COVID-19 cases. Therefore, the on-admission PLR level is a novel, cost-effective, and readily available biomarker with a promising prognostic role for determining the severity of COVID-19 patients.","Simadibrata, Daniel Martin; Pandhita, Bashar Adi Wahyu; Ananta, Muammar Emir; Tango, Tamara",J Intensive Care Soc,774,0

We supplement these debates with the pedagogising of the political as practiced in Latin American social movements, which was influenced by Paulo Freire’s educação popular. Like action research and militant investigation, Freire’s popular education calls for the dissolution of the division between education and social transformation and the inclusion of other forms of knowledge in collective “dialogical” educational processes. The practice of Kollektiv Orangotango arises in the intersection of subculture, research, and activism. On the basis of these experiences, we show how an applied critical geography, understood as popular education, blurs the separation between research and activism as well as between researchers, learners, and activists.","Halder, Severin; Schweizer, Paul",Standort,774,0

In particular, focusing on the importance of informational asymmetry between levels of government, we empirically assess whether this choice is influenced by the relative importance of the local information at the recipient country level. Moreover, we test whether this choice can in turn influence project performance. Using information on more than 5800 World Bank projects for the period 1995-2014, and controlling for characteristics at both country and project level, we find that transparency does influence the probability that a project is implemented locally rather than nationally. More specifically, a one standard deviation decline in transparency increases the probability of a locally implemented project by three percentage points. We also find that a local implementing agency may increase the probability of a successful project only up to a certain level of a country’s transparency.

All the applied methods were successful in the inactivation of yeast and molds, however only the e-beam radiation was able to remove the bacterial microflora. The FTIR analysis revealed no significant changes in the polymer structure, nevertheless, a deterioration of the mechanical properties of the blend was observed. The least invasive method was the UV radiation which did not affect the mechanical parameters and additionally improved the barrier properties of the tested material. Moreover, it was proved that during the e-beam radiation the chain scission and cross-linking occurred. The non-irradiated and irradiated samples were subjected to the enzymatic degradation studies performed in the presence of amylase. The results indicated that irradiation accelerated the decomposition of material, which was confirmed by the measurements of weight loss, and mass of glucose and starch released to the solution in the course of biodegradation, as well as the FTIR and thermal analysis.

BMP-2 is localized in the gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) micropatterns on hydrophilic semi-permeable membrane (SNM), and its controlled release is regulated by the concentration of GelMA hydrogel and BMP-2. The controlled release of BMP-2 is verified using computational analysis and quantified using fluorescein isothiocyanate-bovine serum albumin (FITC-BSA) diffusion model. The osteogenic differentiation of osteosarcoma MG-63 cells is manipulated by localized and controlled BMP-2 release. The calcium deposits are significantly higher and the actin skeletal networks are denser in MG-63 cells cultured in the BMP-2-immobilized GelMA micropattern than in the absence of BMP-2. The proposed BMP-2 carrier is expected to not only act as a barrier membrane that can prevent invasion of connective tissue during bone regeneration, but also as a carrier capable of localizing and controlling the release of BMP-2 due to GelMA micropatterning on SNM. This approach can be extensively applied to tissue engineering, including the localization and encapsulation of cells or drugs.","Yi, Myong-Hee; Lee, Ji-Eun; Kim, Chang-Beom; Lee, Keun-Woo; Lee, Kwang-Ho",Biochip J,774,0

A second aim is to evaluate the current status of gastrointestinal related adverse effects which have been linked to cannabis use, specifically cannabis hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) and acute pancreatitis. RECENT FINDINGS: Observational and prospective studies suggest that cannabinoids improve IBD symptoms. Small prospective clinical trials have not shown any effects on objective inflammatory findings, other than one recent paper in ulcerative colitis, in abstract form only, which suggests endoscopic improvement. Short duration mechanistic studies in functional gut disorders suggest cannabinoids may attenuate gastric emptying and slow colonic motility but appear to have less effect on sensory thresholds in the gut. SUMMARY: In general, while mostly uncontrolled data suggests cannabis may improve symptoms in IBD (and to a lesser degree functional gut disorders), this is not likely due to any substantial anti-inflammatory effect. Much remains unknown about CHS etiology and complete abstinence from cannabinoids remains the generally accepted treatment strategy. Population-based studies do not suggest that cannabis use is related to acute pancreatitis. Further research is certainly warranted.","Nasser, Yasmin; Woo, Matthew; Andrews, Christopher N.",Curr Treat Options Gastroenterol,774,0

Glioblastoma (GBM) patients are among the most vulnerable due to increased incidence in the elderly (median age 64 years, peak between 75–84 years) and the short survival time. A virtual meeting was convened on May 9, 2020 with a panel of international neuro-oncology experts with hands-on experience using Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields). The objective was to assess the risk-to-benefit and to provide guidance for using TTFields in GBM during the COVID-19 pandemic. PANEL DISCUSSION: Topics discussed included support and delivery of TTFields during the COVID-19 pandemic, concomitant use of TTFields with chemotherapy, and any potential impact of TTFields on the immune system in an intrinsically immunosuppressed GBM population. Special consideration was given to TTFields’ use in elderly patients and in combination with radiotherapy regimens (standard versus hypo-fractionated). Finally, we discussed the need to better capture COVID-19 positive brain tumor patients to analyze longitudinal outcomes and subtle changes in treatment decision-making during the pandemic. EXPERT CONSENSUS: TTFields is a portable home-use device which can be managed via telemedicine and safely used in GBM patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. TTFields has no known immunosuppressive effects and is a reliable treatment modality with a relatively favorable side-effect profile. This is important during a crisis where other treatment methods might be limited, especially for elderly patients and patients with multiple co-morbidities. It is too early to estimate the full impact of COVID-19 on the global healthcare system and on patient outcomes and strongly recommended the need to collaborate with existing cancer COVID-19 registries (i.e. CCC19, ESMO-CoCARE, etc.) to follow CNS tumor patients. These efforts would have implications in assessing lessons-learned from this crisis and future guideline development.","Tosha Gatson, Na; Barnholtz-Sloan, Jill S; Drappatz, Jan; Henriksson, Roger; Hottinger, Andreas; Hinoul, Piet; Kruchko, Carol; Puduvalli, Vinay; Tran, David; Wong, Eric; Glas, Martin",Neuro Oncol,774,0

Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields; FDA-approved for GBM; antimitotic device) are alternating electric fields (200 kHz) delivered through scalp-placed transducer arrays to target rapidly dividing GBM cells. Visitor restrictions at cancer-centers and often overburdened healthcare teams provided obstacles to cancer therapy. Health and safety of patients/caregivers, healthcare providers (HCPs), and patient Device Support Specialists (DSS) were prioritized. We evaluated the impact of Novocure® (device manufacturer) implemented strategies on overcoming limitations/restrictions to treatment-access during COVID-19. TREATMENT/PROTOCOL: TTFields (Optune) offers a viable noninvasive, built-in-care system for convenient at-home use. TTFields provides survival benefit with continuous, portable-usage and is tolerable (no-related systemic effects) without overall impact on quality-of-life (except itchy skin). Novocure adopted/amended protocols to meet health guidance/regulation (ie, World Health Organization, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, local, hospital/clinic directives). PERSPECTIVES: COVID-19 forced a change in treatment patterns imposed by quarantine limitations. This, coupled with the vulnerabilities of immunocompromised patients with GBM, necessitated new-access to TTFields. A COVID-19 task force was created to monitor developments, providing directives to minimize risks to patients/caregivers and employees. Hygiene-practices/full-personal protective equipment were applied for live patient-appointments with DSS. Virtual education appointments were executed to guide patients/caregivers through treatment-initiation. New, no-contact, monthly-usage data downloads were employed. Communication measures were implemented, informing HCPs of process changes impacting patients. To date, no observed differences were noted for virtual to non-virtual patient starts, demographics, time-to-start (42-days), treatment discontinuations, percentage continuing therapy (90%), and overall complaints. No new safety signals were observed utilizing new approaches.

Current prophylactic strategies against COVID-19 utilize mRNA vaccines targeting small fragments of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, but these may not induce robust T cell responses or elicit immunity quickly enough. OBJECTIVE: We sought to adapt an FDA-IND approved mRNA vaccine in GBM against COVID-19 for: 1) activation of near immediate immune responses, 2) targeting of full-length SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins, and 3) induction of bidirectional (B and T cell) adaptive immunity. METHODS: We utilized a novel engineering design that layers mRNA into a lipid-nanoparticle (NP) shell (much like an onion); this allows greater packaging of mRNA per particle to quickly boost innate/adaptive immune responses against full-length glioblastoma antigens or SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins. RESULTS: In small and large animal models, RNA-NPs safely mimic viremia activating the quiescent immune system in only a few hours for induction of protective immunity against its mRNA payload. RNA-NPs activate dendritic cells (DCs), upregulate critical innate gene signatures, and induce antigen-specific cellular and humoral immunity. We found that mice receiving SARS-CoV-2 spike RNA-NPs had more effector T cells after vaccination with significant memory recall expansion after in vitro re-stimulation with overlapping SARS-CoV-2 spike peptide mix. We also found increased release of MIP-1-alpha (i.e. CCL3) previously shown by our group (Mitchell et al. Nature 2015) to be responsible for Th1 mediated memory recall to infectious vaccine antigens in GBM patients. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 RNA-NPs elicit memory recall response after vaccination. We have obtained FDA-IND approval (BB-19304, Sayour) in GBM with SARS-CoV-2 specific amendment (BB-20871) underway to support first-in-human trials of RNA-NPs targeting both GBM and COVID-19.","Mendez-Gomez, Hector; Castillo, Paul; Jones, Noah; Qdaisat, Sadeem; Weidert, Frances; Mitchell, Duane; Sayour, Elias",Neuro Oncol,774,0

Interruptions in cancer care may exacerbate patient and caregiver anxiety, but surveying patients/caregivers about their COVID-19 experiences is often limited by attainable sample sizes and over-reliance upon single-institution experiences. METHODS: To explore how COVID-19 is impacting brain tumor patients/caregivers across the U.S., we performed semi-structured interviews with brain tumor patient navigators employed by two different 501(c)3 nonprofit organizations. A semi-structured interview guide was used, utilizing prompts and open-ended questions to facilitate dialogue. A core set of COVID-19 topics were covered, including: financial issues, coping strategies, geographic variability, variability by tumor grade/histology, disruptions in care continuity, accessing clinical trials, psychosocial issues, and end-of-life care. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and organized by discussion topic to identify emerging themes. Inductive sub-coding was completed using the constant comparison method, within and between transcripts. RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: Ten patient navigators were interviewed between April 15(th) and May 8(th), with interviews lasting approximately one hour (range 38-77minutes). Navigators reported having contact with 183 unique brain tumor families during the pandemic (range 7–38 families per navigator). High concordance emerged across narratives, revealing important considerations for the neuro-oncology workforce. The most prominent theme was increased caregiver burden, attributed to maintaining social distancing by reducing visits from home-health aides and friends/family. A related theme that applied to both patients and caregivers was increased social isolation due to social distancing, suspension of in-person support groups, and church/temple closures. Accessing clinical trials was a recurrent issue, exacerbated by patients’ increasing unwillingness to travel. Glioblastoma patients, especially those with recurrent tumors, expressed greater reluctance to travel. Access to standard-of-care treatment was rarely interrupted, but reduced access to supportive services – especially physical and occupational therapy – was identified as an emerging COVID-related deficiency in clinical care.","Walsh, Kyle",Neuro Oncol,774,0

To evaluate capacities, organizational arrangements, and barriers to the implementation of Evidence Centers (NEvs) as part of Brazil’s Evidence-Informed Policy Network (EVIPNet). METHOD. A mixed methods descriptive-analytical, multiple-case exploratory study was performed. Coordinators of active NEvs answered a questionnaire in three parts: participant characteristics, assessment of the capacity to “acquire, assess, adapt, and apply” evidence (4A), and open questions addressing organizational arrangements and barriers to the implementation of NEvs. RESULTS. The study included 15 NEvs, mostly from the Midwest; 73.3% were based in universities, while 20% were installed in state/city health departments or in the Ministry of Health. All coordinators had completed graduate training and 80% reported 1 to 5 years’ experience with evidence-based policies as well as proficiency in English. None of the participants worked exclusively as NEv coordinator. NEv teams included health care professionals, students (undergraduate/graduate), professors, and civil servants from health departments. The data revealed high capacity to “acquire” and “assess” evidence, and low capacity to “adapt” and “apply” evidence. On average, three activities or products were developed yearly by each NEv, especially knowledge translation initiatives (systematic reviews and deliberative dialogues) and training for health care professionals, managers and undergraduate/graduate students. Five barrier categories were described: 1) financing, 2) network integration, 3) institutionalization of demands, 4) adaptive capacity, and 5) research communication skills to recommend actions at the local level. CONCLUSIONS. Trained human resources associated with academic and research institutions are available to support evidence-informed policies. However, the sustainability of NEvs depends on coordinated action to ensure the capacity to adapt and apply evidence.","de Oliveira, Sandra Maria do Valle Leone; Bento, Andressa de Lucca; Valdes, Gabriel; de Oliveira, Saú Tavares Pereira; de Souza, Albert Schiaveto; Barreto, Jorge Otávio Maia",Rev Panam Salud Publica,774,10

Huazhuojiedu decoction (HZJD), a Chinese herbal preparation, has proven clinically effective to treat CAG. However, few studies have explored the mechanism of HZJD in CAG treatment. PURPOSE: This study aimed to shed light on the mechanisms underlying HZJD decoction CAG treatment using a network pharmacology approach and experimental validation. METHODS: The active components of HZJD decoction were obtained from the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database and Analysis Platform. Their targets were predicted through the SwissTargetPrediction database. Disease targets were screened using the GeneCards database. The disease and drug prediction targets were intersected to select the common potential therapeutic targets, which then were input into the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes to build a protein-protein interaction network. The “herb-compound-target-disease” and the “herb-target-pathway” network diagrams were constructed in Cytoscape 3.3.0. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analysis of effective targets were performed using the Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery. Finally, the core targets were preliminarily verified by CAG rat model. The gastric mucosa's histopathological changes were observed via hematoxylin-eosin staining. The expressions of MAPK1, AKT1, TNF, VEGFA, and EGFR were detected by western blot and quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: A total of 155 nodes, including 20 putative targets of HZJD decoction, were selected as core hubs based on topological importance and were closely associated with the regulation of cell proliferation, apoptotic process, and cancer-related pathways (AKT1, TNF, VEGFA, and EGFR) in CAG. Further animal experiments showed that the expression of AKT1 in CAG rats was significantly increased, which was suppressed by HZJD decoction. TNF and VEGFA expression increased in the model group, but did not change in the HZJD group. MAPK1 and EGFR expression showed no significant differences among control, model, and HZJD groups. CONCLUSION: Taken together, the results suggest that the components of HZJD decoction can alleviate and prevent the severity of gastric precancerous lesions via AKT1 inhibition in CAG.","Hao, Xinyu; Liu, Yu; Zhou, Pingping; Jiang, Qian; Yang, Zeqi; Xu, Miaochan; Liu, Shaowei; Zhang, Shixiong; Wang, Yangang",Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,774,0

We utilized routine hospital-wide surveillance data for HAVIs at a quaternary care pediatric hospital in order to assess the impact of enhanced public health measures on rates of HAVI at our institution during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Patient cases of HAVI were detected through routine house-wide microbiologic surveillance. Compliance with our institutional prevention bundle, which includes hand hygiene, appropriate use of isolation precautions and personal protective equipment (PPE), maintaining a clean and clutter free environment, employee illness policy, and restrictions on sick visitors, was measured through use of Kamishibai-card rounding. RESULTS: During the most acute period of the COVID-19 pandemic, intensification of the majority of elements of the HAVI bundle occurred by nature of our institutional response, including use of PPE monitors in certain locations, increased used of eye protection, universal masking for staff and caregivers, re-education for employees on not coming to work sick, and further restrictions to visitation. The monthly HAVI rate in the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic was lower in March (0.76), April (0.27) and May (0.0) 2020 compared to the same time period last year (0.8, 0.8, 0.56). Bundle compliance during those months in 2020 was 83%, 89%, and 100%, respectively. In May, zero HAVIs were identified. (Figure 1) Healthcare-associated viral infections rate and bundle compliance after COVID-19 prevention measures [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: The intensification of routine infection prevention practices aimed at minimizing the transmission of COVID-19 may also reduce rates of HAVI. During our COVID response, we identified a decrease in our institutional HAVI rate compared to the same time last year, reaching lower special cause in May with a rate of 0. We will have ongoing measurement of the HAVI rate throughout the pandemic to determine if this reduction can be sustained and understand which intensified bundle elements need to be maintained in non-pandemic hospital operations.

This has accelerated in the COVID-19 era. FPHCs provide low-income individuals in rural areas with essential primary care services, including sexually transmitted infection prevention, testing, and treatment. The purpose of this analysis is to use spatiotemporal methods to examine the impact of FPHC closures in Iowa on the reported number of gonorrhea and chlamydia cases at the county level. METHODS: This analysis investigates the association between FPHC closures and changes in the number of gonorrhea and chlamydia cases between 2016 and 2018. Iowa implemented defunding policies for family planning clinics, resulting in four FPHC closures in June 2017. 2016 pre-closure STI incidence rates were compared to 2018 post-closure rates. Gonorrhea and chlamydia rates in the four Iowa counties with clinic closures were compared to the 95 Iowa counties without closures. T tests were used to compare changes in reported gonorrhea and chlamydia rates in the two settings. Linear regression modeling was used to determine the relationship between clinic closures and changes in gonorrhea and chlamydia cases. RESULTS: The gonorrhea burden in Iowa increased from 83 cases per 100,000 people in 2016 to 153.8 cases per 100,000 people in 2018. The four counties with clinic closures experienced a significantly larger increase (absolute 217 cases per 100,000 population) in their gonorrhea rate compared to counties without FPHC closures (absolute 121 cases per 100,000 population). There was also a significant relationship between clinic closures and increasing gonorrhea rates (p = 0.0015). Over the three-year period, there was no change in chlamydia rates (p = 0.1182). However, there was a trend towards counties with more FPHC closures having a higher number of chlamydia cases (p = 0.057). CONCLUSION: Despite the fact that many STI diagnoses are made and reported by FPHCs, our data suggest that clinic closures may have contributed to an increase in gonorrhea and chlamydia cases. This is consistent with delayed diagnoses and missed opportunities for providing essential STI services to vulnerable and under-served rural residents. Legislative action is urgently needed to curtail this trend.

We evaluated the prognostic role of change of ultrasonographic (US) air bronchogram in management of CAP in terms of: rate of complicated CAP, change of empiric antibiotic therapy, relationship to defervescence time, and length of hospitalization. METHODS: Patients with CAP and radiographic evidence of lung consolidation were prospectively enrolled. Chest US examinations were performed within 12 h from admission and after 48 h. A new grading system (USINCHILD score) based on presence and features of air bronchogram was adopted. RESULTS: Thirty six patients were stratified into two groups according to the presence of an increase of at least 1 grade of US score (Δ US grade), expression of an improvement of lung consolidation. Δ US grade after 48 h ≥ 1 was associated with an increased risk of complicated CAP (p value 0.027) and a longer defervescence time (p value 0.036). Moreover, Δ US grade ≥ 1 was predictive of a short hospitalization (p value 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: USINCHILD score could be an innovative biotechnology tool for the management of pediatric CAP.

We aimed to evaluate the evidence on potential effects of vitamin C treatment on mortality in adult septic patients. METHODS: Data search included PubMed, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library. A meta-analysis of eligible peer-reviewed studies was performed in accordance with the PRISMA statement. Only studies with valid classifications of sepsis and intravenous vitamin C treatment (alone or combined with hydrocortisone/thiamine) were included. RESULTS: A total of 17 studies including 3133 patients fulfilled the predefined criteria and were analyzed. Pooled analysis indicated no mortality reduction in patients treated with vitamin C when compared to reference (risk difference − 0.05 [95% CI − 0.11 to − 0.01]; p = 0.08; p for Cochran Q = 0.002; I(2) = 56%). Notably, subgroup analyses revealed an improved survival, if vitamin C treatment was applied for 3–4 days (risk difference, − 0.10 [95% CI − 0.19 to − 0.02]; p = 0.02) when compared to patients treated for 1–2 or > 5 days.

Presence of statistical heterogeneity was noted with no sign of significant publication bias. CONCLUSION: Although vitamin C administration did not reduce pooled mortality, patients may profit if vitamin C is administered over 3 to 4 days. Consequently, further research is needed to identify patient subgroups that might benefit from intravenous supplementation of vitamin C.","Scholz, Sean S.; Borgstedt, Rainer; Ebeling, Nicole; Menzel, Leoni C.; Jansen, Gerrit; Rehberg, Sebastian",Crit Care,774,0

This hampers many aspects of P. vivax research. This study aimed to assess the safety of apheresis, a method for selective removal of specific components of blood as a means of extracting and concentrating P. vivax parasites. METHODS: An iterative approach was employed across four non-immune healthy human subjects in single subject cohorts. All four subjects were inoculated with ~ 564 blood stage P. vivax (HMP013-Pv) and subjected to apheresis 10 to 11 days later. Blood samples collected during apheresis (haematocrit layers 0.5% to 11%) were tested for the presence and concentration of P. vivax by microscopy, flow cytometry, 18S rDNA qPCR for total parasites, and pvs25 qRT-PCR for female gametocyte transcripts. Safety was determined by monitoring adverse events. Malaria transmission to mosquitoes was assessed by membrane feeding assays. RESULTS: There were no serious adverse events and no significant safety concerns. Apheresis concentrated asexual parasites by up to 4.9-fold (range: 0.9–4.9-fold) and gametocytes by up to 1.45-fold (range: 0.38–1.45-fold) compared to pre-apheresis densities. No single haematocrit layer contained > 40% of all the recovered P. vivax asexual parasites. Ex vivo concentration of parasites by Percoll gradient centrifugation of whole blood achieved greater concentration of gametocytes than apheresis. Mosquito transmission was enhanced by up to fivefold in a single apheresis sample compared to pre-apheresis. CONCLUSION: The modest level of parasite concentration suggests that the use of apheresis may not be an ideal method for harvesting P. vivax.

The use of duration models allows us to investigate the following: (i) the probability of experiencing HG episodes, (ii) persistence in HG, and (iii) the determinants of the transitions in and out of the HG state and whether their impact varies over the business cycle. We find that about half of the firms experience at least one HG episode, but they seldom experience more than one. Moreover, high-growth status is rarely repeated due to high first-year selection. Yet, in subsequent years beyond the first one, the hazard rate from HG status falls substantially. These results suggest an “episodic” nature of HG and further allow us to identify two groups of firms characterized by the following: (i) (relatively) long HG spells and short no high-growth (NHG) spells and (ii) short HG spells and long NHG spells. In addition, some firm and market (demand) characteristics increase the probability of becoming an HG firm and enhancing HG persistence. Finally, during the downturn, the role of younger age and smaller size in explaining HG decreases.

Although APOBEC3 antagonism is essential for viral pathogenesis, and a more than sufficient functional justification for Vif’s evolution, most viral proteins have evolved multiple functions. Indeed, Vif has long been known to trigger cell cycle arrest and recent studies have shed light on the underlying molecular mechanism.

The synthesized complexes have been characterized by various analytical techniques such as elemental analysis, UV-Vis, IR, and Mass spectroscopy. The mass spectral studies of the complexes have been found to agree with theoretically calculated values. The calculated molar conductance values for the two complexes suggest a non-electrolytic nature of the complexes. A distorted octahedral geometry has been assigned to both the complexes as shown by spectral studies. Results of the electrochemical studies of the complexes through cyclic voltammetry indicate that metal centers can be differentiated by their intrinsic redox systems, viz. Co(III)/Co(II), Co(II)/Co(I) and Ni(II)/Ni(I). Moreover, antimicrobial activities of complexes have been investigated against E. coli, S. aureus, B. subtilis, and P. aeruginosa pathogens.

Its role in blood oxygenation has been well documented. However, the effects on myocardial electrophysiology have not been studied in detail. AIM: To reveal the acute effects of extracorporeal support on new electrocardiography (ECG) parameters in patients with preserved left ventricular functions. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted in three separate clinics. Sixteen consecutive patients under veno-venous ECMO for respiratory insufficiency who soon could be successfully weaned were analyzed. Immediately before and 2 hours after initiation of ECMO, ECG was performed. P wave, QT, QTc and T wave peak to end were measured and calculated from obtained surface 12-lead ECG. RESULTS: There were statistically significant differences immediately before and 2 hours after initiation of ECMO treatment in the Tp-e interval and Tp-e/QTc ratio, the maximum QTc, minimum QTc, and QTc dispersion values, and P wave dispersion (p < 0.0001 for each). All ECG parameters were significantly decreased with ECMO support. CONCLUSIONS: All atrial and ventricular repolarization parameters were decreased in patients with VV-ECMO support. Despite the limited role of ECMO in intractable arrhythmias, the findings of the study revealed that ECMO therapy for respiratory insufficiency may improve atrial ventricular depolarization and repolarization. Therefore, simple 12-lead surface ECG with new ECG parameters may be evaluated for better outcomes.","Göçer, Hakan; Durukan, Ahmet Baris; Naseri, Erdinç; Ünal, Mustafa",Kardiochir Torakochirurgia Pol,774,0

Its onset and peak are during late teens making university students a priority target. Medical student perhaps is at greater risk for developing OCD while corona COVID-19 is expected to more exaggerate symptoms mainly with extra hygiene and cleanliness practices. The aim of the study was to estimate the prevalence of OCD symptoms among Iraqi medical students, and to assess the associated psychological symptoms and its correlates. An analytic cross-sectional study was conducted among Iraqi medical students during the period from August to October 2020. An online anonymous, voluntary, and self-administered questionnaire based on the 18 questions Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory-Revised scale (OCI-R) was used to collect the data. RESULTS: A total of 1644 students had filled the questionnaire. Females were 1116 (67.9%), while 1153 (70.1%) had reported accompanying mental symptoms. Of which worry and stress were the most prevalent with 674 (25.9%) and 617 (23.7%) respectively. However, 707 (43%) have probable OCD symptoms that need further assessment. Unpleasant thoughts were the most prevalent symptoms with 51.8%. Surprisingly, the washing and contamination scales were low at 14% and 19.4% while repeating certain numbers was the least with 8%. OCD symptoms were significantly related to younger age and earlier years of study. Further, all accompanied mental symptoms were significantly associated with probable OCD status. CONCLUSION: High prevalence of OCD among medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic. No association of OCD with gender and family history. Younger students and early years of study were more likely to suffer from OCD symptoms.","Taher, Taqi Mohammed Jwad; Al-fadhul, Shaymaa Abdul Lateef; Abutiheen, Ali A.; Ghazi, Hasanain Faisal; Abood, Naeem Shami",Middle East Curr Psychiatry,774,0

Accordingly, this chapter will address the higher education sector—particularly how COVID-19 has impacted and will continue to impact the future of higher education. It will begin by briefly discussing higher education as a service, before reviewing recent managerial literature on COVID-19’s impact on higher education. The focus and indeed bulk of the chapter will then shift to considering the myriad possible post-pandemic effects on the higher education sector in the eastern hemisphere. Email interviews are conducted with twenty senior academic leaders (including seven Vice Chancellors) in Australia, Bangladesh, Hong Kong, India, Macau, New Zealand, Singapore, Sri Lanka and Thailand.

While it is still uncertain how COVID-19 will reshape our society, the global pandemic is encouraging and accelerating innovation and advancement, especially in the digital sphere. This chapter focuses on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the education service, which is typically classified as a service industry in industrial classifications. Digital transformation in the education sector has attracted significant attention recently. The current education system in Japan is based on a structure that was institutionalized in the industrial age. Although education has seen innovation since then, it is one of the sectors wherein innovation occurs at a slow pace, and therefore, it does not meet the sector’s expectations and demands. The COVID-19 pandemic is, however, accelerating digital transformation in education: Not only in Japan, but globally too, educators, students, policymakers, and other role players are now actively undertaking efforts to bring about digital transformation in this sector. This chapter reviews the rapid expansion of digital transformation in the education service and explores, in detail, the two main trends in digital transformation in the education service in Japan. These trends are the expanding of distance education and increasing innovation in educational technologies. The discussion further reflects on prior studies questioning the impact of digital transformation on education; it also anticipates and explores the effects of and concerns about the digital transformation in the education service. Finally, the chapter includes a discussion on how to address these concerns and maximize the digital impact. It indicates three concerns of the digital transformation in the education service: (1) poor motivation management, (2) negative effect of IT devices usage in education, (3) educational inequality by digital divide. They can be overcome by changing roles of instructors and further investment in ICT infrastructure in the education service. The discussions in this chapter give insight into how the education service might evolve after the COVID-19 pandemic. The distance education is becoming a new normal in the education service. However, the education community in general is not ready to maximize the merits of distance learning. We need to change the role of instructors from a knowledge teacher to a learning motivator and progress manager. In addition, we need more investment in ICT infrastructure in the education service to enhance educational effects.","Kang, Byeongwoo","The Future of Service Post-COVID-19 Pandemic, Volume 1",774,1

The most common symptoms of COVID‐19 are fever, dry cough, and shortness of breath, but delirium has been reported in older adults, including those with preexisting neurodegenerative disorders. Some research has suggested that the role of neuropsychiatric sequelae in COVID‐19, especially delirium, has been underreported and that the lack of fever and respiratory distress in this population may exacerbate underdiagnosis and subsequent mortality. Here, we discuss the variable course of COVID‐19 by detailing the course of illness in two individuals who are age 90+ with mild COVID‐19. METHOD: We conducted chart reviews and telephone interviews in two patients who were age 90+. Case 1 had an outpatient follow‐up visit via teleconferencing. Due to COVID‐19 protocols, in‐person research assessments were not completed. Both were on hospice due to underlying terminal medical conditions. RESULT: Both cases are age 90+ patients with dementia who receive hospice care for multiple underlying medical comorbidities. Case 1 presented at home with a low‐grade temperature that was below the CDC COVID‐19 guidelines for fever at that time; he experienced cough, confusion, and functional decline and was admitted to a COVID‐19 unit after testing positive for the disease. His workup also included a COVID‐19 laboratory panel, which was mostly abnormal (including extremely elevated brain natriuretic peptide) but had normal WBC. He did not experience further deterioration, and 22 days later, after testing COVID‐19 negative, he was discharged to a skilled nursing facility (SNF), followed by discharge to home 15 days later. Case 2 had metastatic carcinoma and a preexisting diagnosis of probable dementia with Lewy bodies. COVID‐19 was diagnosed through all‐resident screening at his SNF. He did not exhibit respiratory symptoms or fever at that time. While nursing staff reported confusion, agitation, and restlessness, these symptoms could not be differentiated from complications related to his underlying dementia. This patient was isolated within the SNF and was not hospitalized. CONCLUSION: These two cases demonstrate the variability of symptom manifestation in COVID‐19 in this high‐risk population.","Tsuang, Debby W.; Payne, Sarah; Jankowski, Adrienne; Shutes‐David, Andrew; Ritchey, Katherine",Alzheimers Dement,774,0

These included exclusion of all visitors, room isolation and other measures. These measures were anticipated to have a deleterious effect on the mental health of SNF‐LTC residents. An Indiana neuro‐behavioral health practice (Vanguard Eldercare Medical Group), providing on‐site care at greater than 200 SNF‐LTC’s, measured the change in incoming urgent/emergent patient care phone requests during April as a potential proxy for a negative change in SNF‐LTC resident neuro‐psychiatric status. METHOD: Urgent/emergent incoming behavioral health phone requests were compiled from January 1, 2020 until May 17, 2020 on a weekly basis. Incoming calls during regular business hours (BH) (M‐F 7:00 AM to 5:00 PM) and after‐hours (AH) were measured from the medical group’s telephone monitoring system and EMR. These were analyzed using one‐tailed t‐tests to determine if the onset of the COVID‐19 pandemic (declared 3/11/2020) increased the number of incoming calls after accounting for the number of patients. RESULT: In Figure 1, the number of BH calls appears to increase in the end of March, while AH calls appear to decline. Table 1 shows the mean number of BH calls per week prior to 3/9/2020 increases from 41.44 to 69.03 (p=0.0014). After hours calls decreased from 17.33 to 9.8 (p=0.00056) and the number of patients served increased from 7618.33 to 7767.90 (p=0.0073). To adjust for the increasing patient population, we calculated the mean number of calls per week per 1000 residents. BH calls per 1000 patients increased from 5.44 to 8.67 (p=0.0018) and AH calls per 1000 patients decreased from 2.28 to 1.26 (p=0.00052). CONCLUSION: It was anticipated that increased stressors would negatively impact these residents’ mental health. The significant increase in behavioral health phone requests suggests confirmation of this hypothesis. The disparity between business hours and after‐hours phone calls may be due to heightened SNF‐LTC staff awareness and/or change in the nature/severity of behavioral health decompensation.","Posar, Steven Laurence; Reid, Anita; Heiser, Daniel",Alzheimers Dement,774,0

This scenario does not differ in Brazil. The elderly represent the fastest growing population segment, with estimates of average increase over the next ten years of more than 1 million elderly per year, which is worrying because epidemiological data show that one third of elderly Brazilians are affected by neuropsychiatric disorders. It is important to consider some conditions can represent risk factors for the development of cognitive decline. Therefore, attention to these disorders is necessary as they bring important social and economic impacts. Thus, the development of projects in this area may provide not only a reduction in public spending, but also more years of life with autonomy and independence. Based on all of these data and on our knowledge about gerontology and dementia, we decided to bring the Memory Cafe philosophy to Sao Paulo, Brazil. METHODS: We initiated the Memory Café Brasil (MCBr) in December 2019 and realized three face‐to‐face meetings (FFM) until February and four online meetings (OM) until 23rd May 2020, due to COVID‐19. All of them were guided according Memory Cafe Directory guidelines. Cognitive stimulation was performed during all meetings. RESULTS: 30 people have participated in the meetings so far, 14 of whom answered the online questionnaire with open‐ended questions to evaluate the MCBr. Of the 14 participants (mean 56 years old; 19SD), 78.6% were women. Ten of them participated more than once in the meetings and five participated in both types of meetings. The FFM were attended by 6 people (70yo; SD9), while the OM were attended by 13 people (57yo; 19,6DS). Most of them reported that OM helped in a positive way to alleviate loneliness during social isolation as well as making it possible to improve cognitive functions. Subjective complaints of cognitive decline was reported by 4 participants. CONCLUSIONS: MCBr is recent in Brazil and is looking for ways to increasingly include people with congenital and/or acquired cognitive decline in society, as well as their caregivers, by promoting well‐being and cognitive stimulation.","Bram, Jessyka Maria de França; Carvalho, Claudia Lopes",Alzheimers Dement,774,0

First, the pandemic has made it more difficult for people to identify norms of politeness and behave appropriately in circumstances that were previously less contested and problematic. Furthermore, signalling respect and consideration towards others via polite speech or behaviour is more likely to go awry during COVID-19. Additionally, the lack of clarity surrounding norms of politeness may prevent polite acts from helping to mitigate conflict and facilitate cooperative social exchange. Finally, citizens and politicians can exploit disruptions around politeness norms to engage in behaviour that under normal circumstances would be considered impolite.

The aim of this study was to optimize and control the particle filtration efficiency and apparent surface quality of the melt-blown fabric from the perspectives of electret masterbatch composition and processing parameters. Magnesium stearate and fumed silica were used as the electret to manufacture polypropylene melt-blown fabric. The layout and charge voltage of the electret device was taken as the variables to optimize and improve the particle filtration efficiency and bulkiness coefficient of the fabric. The temperature of the barrel and die was controlled to enhance the surface quality and corresponding particle filtration efficiency. The results showed that a combination of organic magnesium stearate and inorganic fumed silica could obtain a balance between particle filtration efficiency and smooth processing without being jammed. Increasing the charge voltage and rearranging the position of the charge wires could significantly enhance the particle filtration efficiency. A better particle filtration efficiency and reasonable bulkiness coefficient could be obtained by controlling the diameter of the filaments by regulating the temperature of the barrel and die as well as the suction intensity.

The comparative Raman analysis allowed to determine a specific signature of the pathological saliva, highlighting differences in determined biological species, already studied and characterized in COPD onset, compared to the Raman signature of healthy samples. The unsupervised principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering revealed a sharp data dispersion between the two experimental groups. Using the linear discriminant analysis, we created a classification model able to discriminate the collected signals with accuracies, specificities, and sensitivities of more than 98%. The results of this preliminary study are promising for further applications of Raman spectroscopy in the COPD clinical field.","Carlomagno, Cristiano; Gualerzi, Alice; Picciolini, Silvia; Rodà, Francesca; Banfi, Paolo Innocente; Lax, Agata; Bedoni, Marzia",Diagnostics (Basel),774,0

There is considerable heterogeneity in terms of uptake, adherence, and outcomes, but because within-scheme analyses dominate previous research, there is limited contextual understanding of this variance. Both the impact of schemes on health inequalities and best practices for inclusion of at-risk groups are unclear. To address this, we modelled secondary data from the multi-scheme National Referral Database, comprising 23,782 individuals across 14 referral schemes, using a multilevel Bayesian inference approach. Scheme-level local demographics identified over-sampling in uptake; on the basis of uptake and completion data, more inclusive schemes (n = 4) were identified. Scheme coordinators were interviewed, and data were analyzed using a grounded theory approach. Inequalities presented in a nuanced way. Schemes showed promise for engaging populations at greater risk of poor health (e.g., those from more deprived areas or of an ethnic minority background). However, the completion odds were lower for those with a range of complex circumstances (e.g., a mental health-related referral). We identified creative best practices for widening access (e.g., partnership building), maintaining engagement (e.g., workforce diversity), and tailoring support, but recommend changes to wider operational contexts to ensure such approaches are viable.","Oliver, Emily J.; Dodd-Reynolds, Caroline; Kasim, Adetayo; Vallis, Dimitrios",Int J Environ Res Public Health,774,0

To this aim, the influence of incorporation of graphene nanosheets into ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) on the thermal behavior and degradation kinetics of UHMWPE/graphene nanocomposites was investigated. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis revealed that graphene nanosheets were uniformly spread throughout the UHMWPE’s molecular chains. X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) data posited that the morphology of dispersed graphene sheets in UHMWPE was exfoliated. Non-isothermal differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) studies identified a more pronounced increase in melting temperatures and latent heat of fusions in nanocomposites compared to UHMWPE at lower concentrations of graphene. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and derivative thermogravimetric (DTG) revealed that UHMWPE’s thermal stability has been improved via incorporating graphene nanosheets. Further, degradation kinetics of neat polymer and nanocomposites have been modeled using equations such as Friedman, Ozawa–Flynn–Wall (OFW), Kissinger, and Augis and Bennett’s. The ""Model-Fitting Method” showed that the auto-catalytic nth-order mechanism provided a highly consistent and appropriate fit to describe the degradation mechanism of UHMWPE and its graphene nanocomposites. In addition, the calculated activation energy (E(a)) of thermal degradation was enhanced by an increase in graphene concentration up to 2.1 wt.%, followed by a decrease in higher graphene content.","Jafari, Iman; Shakiba, Mohamadreza; Khosravi, Fatemeh; Ramakrishna, Seeram; Abasi, Ehsan; Teo, Ying Shen; Kalaee, Mohammadreza; Abdouss, Majid; Ramazani S.

We present and explain the steps necessary to produce a 3D model from medical image data, and express the significant value such models have in patient-specific pre-operative planning as well as education. A Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) viewer is used to create 3D visualization from a patient’s Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) images. After generating the reconstruction, we manually remove the anatomical components that we wish to exclude from the print by utilizing tools provided with the imaging software. We then export this 3D reconstructions file into a Standard Triangulation Language (STL) file which is then run through a “Slicer” software to generate a G-code file for the printer. After the print is complete, the supports created during the printing process are removed manually. The 3D-printed models we created were of good accuracy and scale. The median production time used for the models described in this manuscript was 4.4 h (range: 3.9–4.5 h). Models were evaluated by neurosurgical teams at local hospital for quality and practicality for use in urgent and non-urgent care. We hope we have provided readers adequate insight into the equipment and software they would require to quickly produce their own accurate and cost-effective 3D models from CT angiography images.

We analyse the stock price movements of three major airlines companies using a new approach which leverages a measure of internet concern on different topics. In this approach, Twitter data and Google Trends are used to create a set of predictors which then leads to an appropriately modified GARCH model. In the analysis, first we show that the ongoing pandemic has an unprecedented severe effect. Then, the proposed model is used to analyse and forecast stock price volatility of the airlines companies. The findings establish that our approach can successfully use the effects of internet concern for different topics on the movement of stock price index and provide good forecasting accuracy. Model confidence set (MCS) procedure further shows that the short‐term volatility forecasts are more accurate for this method than other candidate models. Thus, it can be used to understand the stock market during a pandemic in a better way. Further, the proposed approach is attractive and flexible, and can be extended to other related problems as well.","Deb, Soudeep",,774,0

The XRD analysis confirmed the cubic structure of CdS on Zn doped CdS and Zn, Ni dual doped CdS without any secondary/impurity phases and no alteration in CdS cubic phase was noticed by Zn/Ni addition. The shrinkage of crystallite size from 69 to 43 Å and the variation in lattice constants and micro-strain were described by the addition of Ni and the defects associated with Ni(2+) ions. Microstructural and optical studies of the prepared films were carried out using scanning electron microscope (SEM), UV-visible spectrometer and photoluminescence (PL) spectra. The enhanced optical absorbance in the visible wavelength and the reduced energy gap by Ni substitution showed that Cd(0.89)Zn(0.1)Ni(0.01)S nanostructures are useful to improve the efficiency of opto-electronic devices. The functional groups of Cd-S/Zn-Cd-S/Zn/Ni-Cd-S and their chemical bonding were verified by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) studies. The elevated visible PL emissions such as blue and green emissions by Ni addition was explained by decreasing of crystallite size and generation of more defects. Zn, Ni dual doped CdS nanostructures are identified as the probable an efficient photo-catalyst for the degradation of methylene blue dye. The liberation of more charge carriers, better visible absorbance, improved surface to volume ratio and the creation of more defects are accountable for the current photo-catalytic activity in Zn/Ni doped CdS which exhibited better photo-catalytic stability after sex cycling process. The better bacterial killing ability is noticed in Ni doped Cd(0.9)Zn(0.1)S nanostructure which is due to the collective effect of lower particle/grain size and also higher ROS producing capacity.","Raju, P.; Jesuraj, Joseph Prince; Muthukumaran, S.",J Mater Sci: Mater Electron,774,0

The ‘Gharat’ is made from the natural resources that are easily available in the area and operates through the water force coming from glaciers, perennial streams and rivulets. Thus, it is an environment friendly source of livelihood for the ‘Gharatis’ (the owner of Gharat). In the present communication, an effort was made to document the status of Gharats in the high-altitude Himalayan regions of Pangi and Tissa of district Chamba. Field surveys were conducted in a total of twenty remote villages of Pangi and Tissa regions (ten in each site). Information was collected on pre-designed semi-structured questionnaires from local people that primarily consisted of Gharatis, elderly informants and the inhabitants living in the vicinity of Gharats. All possible reasons responsible for the increase and reduction in the number of Gharats in the study areas were also documented by interviewing the informants. The study revealed that in the Pangi region number of Gharats have increased and are in good condition whereas there is a drastic decline in the number of Gharats in Tissa. The informants in Pangi gave maximum responses favouring motivational factors while in Tissa maximum responses were obtained for demotivational factors. Based on these responses, we prioritized the corrective measures for improving the efficiency of Gharats and restoration of this age-old indigenous and environment friendly technology. This will surely enhance livelihood security of the inhabitants besides optimum utilization of the natural resources in the Himalayan region.

Studies from the SARS-CoV outbreak in 2003 highlighted the relationship between SARS-CoV and ACE-2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) receptors in pancreatic islet cells. We describe a pediatric patient who developed Diabetes Mellitus after exposure to the Sars-CoV-2 virus. Case Report: A previously healthy 13-year-old female of Mexican descent was found to be hyperglycemic at her annual visit. The patient endorsed polyuria and polydipsia for 3 weeks, and weight loss for 3months. 3 months prior to presentation, her mother became ill and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR analysis. The patient had no SARS-CoV-2 associated symptoms. Her exam was notable for a BMI was in the 78%ile for age with no acanthosis nigricans. She had no family history of diabetes or autoimmune disease. Initial blood glucose was 729 mg/dL, with bicarbonate of 20.6 mEq/L, pH 7.45, and anion gap of 14 mEq/L. Large ketones were present in the urine. Her concomitant C-peptide level of 1.0 ng/ml was low in the setting of hyperglycemia. Her HbA1c was 14.3%. Diabetes-related autoantibodies, celiac, and thyroid antibodies were negative. Her Sars-CoV-2 antibody titer was positive with a negative PCR. The patient was treated with a basal-bolus regimen of subcutaneous insulin at a maximal total daily dose of 0.7 u/kg/day. 5 weeks later, her insulin requirement and HbA1C were both lower; at 0.5 u/kg/day and 9.3% respectively. Discussion: This patient’s symptoms of hyperglycemia started shortly after her exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. She had no features consistent with Type 2 DM. She similarly had no serological evidence of DM related autoimmunity, thus being different from reports of new-onset Type 1 DM with confirmed autoimmunity presenting during the Sars-CoV-2 pandemic. Although Type 1B DM without evidence of humoral islet autoimmunity and monogenic DM could not be fully excluded, we postulate that the patient developed SARS-CoV-2 associated DM given her time course and documented exposure to SARS –CoV-2 with the presence of SARS-CoV antibodies. One similar case has previously been reported By Holstein et al.

Youth with obesity, insulin resistance, and dysglycemia are increasingly presenting with HHS and/or DKA, leading to increased morbidity and mortality. Case Descriptions:Case 1: A 17-year-old Hispanic female with history of obesity, insulin resistance, and hyperglycemia reported polyuria, polydipsia, and polyphagia for 2 months. The day of admission, EMS was called because patient was found unresponsive at home and required advanced CPR. At arrival to the ED, the patient was awake and responsive. She had acanthosis nigricans and abdominal striae. Initial labs showed elevated plasma glucose (1,256 mg/dL), sodium (153 mmol/L), bicarbonate (9 mmol/L), anion gap (35 mmol/L), phosphorus (7.5 mg/dL; N=3-4.8), lactate (4 mmol/L; N=0.5-2), BHB (11.4 mmol/L; N=0-0.3), venous pH (7.09), BUN (24 mg/dL), creatinine (1.63 mg/dL), and HbA1c (14.3%). She was admitted for DKA, hyperosmolarity, AKI, and metabolic encephalopathy. After IVF resuscitation, insulin drip at 0.05 U/kg/h was started. She recovered from DKA, AKI and hyperosmolarity after 5 days. T1D antibody tests were negative. C-peptide was low (0.7 ng/mL; N=0.8-3.5), and TSH was low (0.38 uIU/mL) with normal free T4 (0.88 mg/dL). Case 2: A 13-year-old Hispanic female with history of asthma, morbid obesity, premature adrenarche, and prediabetes started presenting polydipsia and polyuria 2 months before admission. One day before admission, she presented drowsiness, abdominal pain, and polyuria. Initial labs at the ED included glucose (792 mg/dL), bicarbonate (10.4 mmol/L), anion gap (28 mmol/L), venous CO(2) (10.4 mmol/L; N=21-31), BHB (>22.5 mmol/L), sodium (153 mmol/L), BUN (29 mg/dL), and creatinine (1.37 mg/dL), consistent with DKA, hyperosmolarity, and AKI. Physical exam showed severe obesity, acanthosis nigricans, and hypertension. IV fluids and insulin drip at 0.075 U/kg/h were started. DKA and AKI resolved after 4 days. Labs showed negative T1D antibodies, normal C-peptide (1.2 ng/mL), HgA1C (>14%), microalbuminuria (16.22 mg/dL; N<2 mg/dL), elevated total cholesterol (230 mg/dL) and triglycerides (550 mg/dL). Both youth were negative for SARS-CoV2 and had been engaging in unhealthy lifestyle choices, such as sedentarism and excessive sugary drink intake, exacerbated by COVID-19-related lockdowns and school closures. There were delays in seeking medical care associated to fear of COVID-19. Conclusion: In the current context of a pandemic, it would be helpful to plan close evaluation and timely therapeutic interventions for youth with well-known high-metabolic risks to prevent hospitalizations, severe presentations of T2D and associated morbidity and/or mortality.","Long, Nathaniel; Eichner, Natalie Z M; Benavides-Vasquez, Jorge; Saenz, Lina Paola Huerta",J Endocr Soc,774,0

Hyperglycemia is common in hospitalized patients with COVID requiring intensive monitoring and management. Close monitoring of glucoses requires increased use of personal protective equipment (PPE), which has been in limited supply since the beginning of the pandemic. The FDA granted conditional allowance for use of continuous glucose monitors (CGM) in hospital settings during the COVID pandemic to allow for preservation of PPE. We present the process of implementing a continuous glucose monitoring program in an urban safety net hospital. Methods: The program was implemented at a county urban safety net hospital. Patients were eligible to be started on Dexcom G6 CGM if they had hyperglycemia requiring multiple insulin injections daily, were in contact isolation, and were located in 1 of 3 units of the hospital (medical intensive care unit [MICU], surgical intensive care unit, COVID 19 floor unit). Initial program was started in the MICU and subsequently expanded. Nurses and staff underwent training using videos, in-person demonstrations, and written guides. Informational Technology modified the electronic medical system to allow for ordering and documentation of CGM values by nurses. Supplies were stored both on unit and in central supply allowing for primary team to initiate monitoring independent of diabetes team. Records of patients participating in program were maintained by the diabetes team. Amount of PPE saved was estimated to be 10 instances/day while on insulin drip and 3/day when using subcutaneous insulin. Results: A total of 69 patients used a CGM during their hospital course. Average age was 56 years old, 69 % were male, average BMI 31, and 84% had known diabetes prior to admission. The majority of patients were critically ill with 68% intubated, 48% on vasopressors, 6% requiring dialysis, 38% on insulin drip, 46% were on tube feeds, and 74% received steroids. The racial demographics of the patients were 72% White, 3% Black, 4% Native American, 4% Asian, and 14% other. For ethnicity, 73% identified as Hispanic and half spoke Spanish as their primary language. An estimated 2600 instances of PPE were saved. Challenges that were faced in implementing the program included consistent training of large numbers of staff, maintaining supplies in stock, troubleshooting discordant values, and restricting use of CGM to patients who met qualifications. Conclusion: Overall, the implementation of CGM was successful and received a positive response. Staff in the primary units quickly became comfortable with the application of the technology. Potential challenges in the future include ongoing training, improving troubleshooting of technology, validating the accuracy of the devices, and developing funding for CGM equipment and interpretation.","Finn, Erin E; Schlichting, Lindsay; Pereira, Rocio Ines",J Endocr Soc,774,0

But patient had pregnancy test was done and she was found to be negative but her thyroid function test showed low TSH 0.32mIU/ml (0.47-4.68mIU/ml). Patient states around same time she was diagnosed with COVID-19 infection and she lost 5 pounds during that time but even after recovery from the infection she continued to lose weight and lost a total of 18 pounds in 3 months. Patient states during the time of COVID-19 infection she was having difficulty swallowing and painful swallowing but following infection patient denied any current difficulty swallowing or breathing, headache, vision changes, cold or heat intolerance, diarrhea or constipation, tremors, proximal muscle weakness, bulging of her eyes. Patient continue to have regular monthly menstrual cycles. Three months following infection patients repeat thyroid function tests were done and it showed normal TSH 0.56mIU/ml(0.47-4.68mIU/ml),free T4 1.05ng/dL(0.78-2.19ng/dL) and negative thyroid antibodies like TSI index<1.0, Thyroid peroxidase Antibodies 1.4 IU/mL, Thyrotropin Receptor Ab <1.00 IU/L. Patient also had normal thyroid ultrasound. Patient had complete resolution of hyperthyroid symptoms and did not require any medications. Conclusion: In conclusion, physicians should be engaged in close monitoring of thyroid disease in patients with suspected COVID-19, for timely detecting signs of disease progression. Finally, the presence of thyroid disease shall be regarded as an important factor in future risk stratification models for COVID-19.","Katkar, Rujuta Baban",J Endocr Soc,774,16

It’s accuracy has been doubted and subsequently had effects on planning, performing operations causing. Research has suggested the use of Computed Tomography Scan instead. In this study we performed a meta-analysis comparing the diagnostic accuracy of CT compared to RTPCR. METHOD: Our systematic review and meta-analysis were undertaken as per PRISMA guidelines. The methodological quality of each included study was assessed using the QUADAS-2 tool on RevMan 5.3. We performed data analyses using Stata version 12. RESULTS: Sensitivity estimates for CT scan ranged from 0.69 to 1.00 and for RT-PCR varied ranging from 0.47 to 1.00. The pooled estimate of sensitivity for CT was 0.95 (95% CI – 0.88-0.98) and specificity was 0.31 (95% CI – 0.035-0.84). It was found that specificity of initial RT-PCR(100%) was higher than CT(31%). With respect to sensitivity, CT(95%) was superior to RT-PCR(91%) p (0.000) CONCLUSIONS: Sensitivity of CT is significantly higher than RT-PCR for detecting COVID-19 infection, however as CT findings are not specific. Since CT scans are readily available, protocols can be developed to utilise it to minimalize delay in planning surgery.","Siddiqui, S; Mair, M; Hussain, M; Das, S",Br J Surg,774,0

We present our endourology service provision throughout the “lockdown” period. METHOD: Endourological operations 23(rd) March to 11(th) May 2020 were designated to the base hospital or independent “green” site by urgency and comorbidity status. Base hospital emergencies underwent surgery in main theatres, whilst elective patients had dedicated “COVID-free” theatres and wards. A portable Holmium laser enabled lasertripsy at the independent site. After 27(th) April, elective cases required a negative swab and 2-week self-isolation pre-operatively. RESULTS: 70 operations were performed: 42 ureteroscopies, 20 stent procedures, 8 PCNLs. Mean age was 57 and 58 at base and independent sites respectively, mean ASA 2.1 and 1.9. 37 operations (53%) occurred at the base hospital, including 14 emergencies (38%). 19 patients received post-operative COVID-19 swabs: 3 positives (8%), all emergencies. 2 patients (5%) died of COVID-19 pneumonia within 35 days; both had negative pre-operative swabs. Of 33 patients at the independent site, 3 (9%) received post-operative swabs, all negative. None had COVID-19 symptoms post-operatively. CONCLUSIONS: “COVID-free” hospitals, wards and theatres enable elective operating whilst minimising peri-operative virus risk. Further utilisation of independent hospitals would more safely allow operating throughout the pandemic.","Bratt, D; Satherley, H; Konstantinidi, K; Ratan, H; Bodiwala, D",Br J Surg,774,0

Current standard is the utilisation of double technique with radioisotope and blue dye to decrease false negative rates for true sentinel node retrieval. METHOD: Literature search on the topic in the last two decades. RESULTS: The search yielded 197 publications which were subjected to a meticulous review. CONCLUSIONS: Single agent radioisotope is recommended in palpable and good biology breast tumours. Use of single agent blue dye can be standardised in axillary tail tumours. It is also recommended when isotope mapping is logistically not feasible or during pandemics like COVID 19 where looming infrastructure challenges are prevalent. Dual agent technique should be considered in previously treated breast and axilla, neoadjuvant chemotherapy cohort, bad tumour biology, high BMI and macromastia groups for true nodal retrieval. Optimal number of nodes taken out should not be more than three (n = 3). Lower axillary sampling of not more than 3 nodes is recommended for troubleshooting. Magnetic tracing can be used as an adjunct to either single agent (RI/BD) technique when there is failure to localise the sentinel node.","Arif, T; Absar, M S",Br J Surg,774,0

Our institution was one of the first trust to offer essential elective surgery using a “COVID-free” designated site during the start of the pandemic. The aim of this study is to analyse the clinical outcomes of patients who underwent essential elective procedures during the virus outbreak in the UK. METHOD: Retrospective analysis of outcomes all patients who had undergone urgent elective and cancer surgery, from 30(th) March 2020 to 21(st) May 2020, using an implemented “Super Green Pathway”. The primary endpoints were 30 days mortality and COVID related morbidities, and the secondary endpoints were surgical related complications and oncological outcomes. RESULTS: 92 patients (Male:45%; Female:55%) across 5 surgical specialties were identified. There was no record of mortality in our cohort. Only 1 patient was tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, 18 days after the initial operation without any pulmonary complications. CONCLUSIONS: It is possible to mitigate the high mortality risk of postoperative complications associated with COVID-19, with no delay to essential surgeries for cancer patients, thus delivering safe practice during the pandemic.","Tam, A; Elhadi, M; Ong, C T; Bhat, A; Akhtar, M",Br J Surg,774,6

Our understanding of the risks associated with paediatric surgery is more limited, with preliminary data suggesting lower morbidity/mortality than in adults. A < 1% incidence of COVID-19 in paediatric patients undergoing preoperative universal screening is reported, and even in those testing positive, morbidity and mortality seem to be low. As waiting lists swell and the detriment associated with delaying surgery mounts, it is imperative to accurately quantify the risks of surgery in the paediatric population. METHOD: Retrospective review of all paediatric ENT operations performed at the Evelina Children’s Hospital at the height of lockdown, from March to May 2020. RESULTS: 61 procedures were performed on 56 patients. 50% had a pre-operative SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal swabs. All cases involved a change in anesthetic practice; 2 cases involved a change in surgical practice. We noted 2 medical complications and 1 surgical complication. All patients are currently extant. No staff or patients subsequently developed COVID. CONCLUSIONS: Our perioperative infection rates and mortality/morbidity figures concord with figures published elsewhere in literature. We are cautiously optimistic regarding risks associated with paediatric ENT surgery.","Huang, J; Bhargava, E; Walsh, M; Pennell, D; Attya, H; Jablenska, L; Ferguson, L; Lilly, I; Pepper, C; Tweedie, D; Possamai, V",Br J Surg,774,16

We identified the need to assess patient’s opinion of the disruption caused to their lives by attending a virtual clinic appointment compared to a face-to-face appointment at a General Surgery department of a UK hospital. METHOD: 627 patients attended a virtual clinic in General Surgery between 25(th) March 2020 and 30(th) April 2020. Patients were selected using a random number generator; they were called and asked to complete a google survey which was sent via email. A shorter survey was also conducted over the phone for patients who did not have an email address. RESULTS: 73 patients completed the online or telephone survey. 77.8% (n = 42) reported that they had no problems accessing the virtual clinic. 74.1% of patients (n = 40) agreed that virtual clinics caused less disruption to their daily life. 87.7% (n = 64) saved time by attending the virtual clinic. 67.1% (n = 49) saved two or more hours. 65.8% made a financial saving.

QUESTION: Can VR be a viable method of learning and skill retention for orthopaedic trainees during periods of diminished operative time? METHOD: A systematic search using Google Scholar, EMBASE and PubMed was conducted in July 2020. RESULTS: Following the PRIMSA guidelines; initial search revealed 779 studies. 35 full text articles were analysed by two reviewers with a final total of 30 articles used in this review. A thematic analysis revealed three broad categories: quality and validity of VR teaching simulations studies (n = 8); learning curves and subject performance (n = 14) and VR simulators utility in orthopaedics reviews (n = 8). CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that VR has the capacity to help trainees maintain their technical skills, enhance their precision, and retain rudimentary competency during this pandemic. Additional improvements are necessary to ensure its safety as a training tool.","Salaja, B; Feeley, A; Feeley, I; Merghani, K",Br J Surg,774,0

Until recently, GPCRs signaling was thought to emanate exclusively from the plasma membrane as a response to extracellular stimuli but several studies have challenged this view demonstrating that GPCRs can be present in intracellular localizations, including in the nuclei. A renewed interest in GPCR receptors’ superfamily emerged and intensive research occurred over recent decades, particularly regarding class A GPCRs, but some class B and C have also been explored. Nuclear GPCRs proved to be functional and capable of triggering identical and/or distinct signaling pathways associated with their counterparts on the cell surface bringing new insights into the relevance of nuclear GPCRs and highlighting the nucleus as an autonomous signaling organelle (triggered by GPCRs). Nuclear GPCRs are involved in physiological (namely cell proliferation, transcription, angiogenesis and survival) and disease processes (cancer, cardiovascular diseases, etc.). In this review we summarize emerging evidence on nuclear GPCRs expression/function (with some nuclear GPCRs evidencing atypical/disruptive signaling pathways) in non-communicable disease, thus, bringing nuclear GPCRs as targets to the forefront of debate.","Gonçalves-Monteiro, Salomé; Ribeiro-Oliveira, Rita; Vieira-Rocha, Maria Sofia; Vojtek, Martin; Sousa, Joana B.; Diniz, Carmen",Pharmaceuticals (Basel),774,1

This pandemic has resulted in increased digital transformation, changes in customer behavior and the managerial and technological knowledge gap to address them. Therefore, this article discusses the general weaknesses, strengths, challenges and opportunities for SMEs to face this pandemic, and how the field of knowledge management (KM) can help. Based on the concepts of organizational resilience, we drafted a conceptual model to illustrate how their first responses were and how they could become more adapted. First, we conducted a literature search to investigate how SMEs responded to this scenario. We found responses to the financial impacts in the form of mass layoffs, temporary and permanent closures, bootstrapping of digitalization and strategic alliances. In the discussions section, we raise some key questions to demonstrate how knowledge can improve the role of digital transformation. We approach how a KM strategy could start from organizational resilience concepts to assist SMEs to seize digital transformation opportunities. As practical implications, our research raises awareness of digital transformation's role as a set of tools to adapt during and after the pandemic, along with resilience engineering and knowledge management principles.

It was demonstrated that, at NPG-modified microdisc electrode arrays, salbutamol is distinguishable from the chloride excipient present at 0.0154 M using linear sweep voltammetry and can be detected amperometrically. In contrast, bare gold microdisc electrode arrays cannot afford such discrimination, as the potential for salbutamol oxidation and chloride adsorption reactions overlap. The discriminative power of NPG originates from the nanoconfinement effect for chloride in the internal pores of NPG, which selectively enhances the electron transfer kinetics of this more sluggish reaction relative to that of the faster, diffusion-controlled salbutamol oxidation. Sensing was performed at a fully integrated three-electrode cell-on-chip using Pt as a quasi-reference electrode.","Nagle, Lorraine C.; Wahl, Amelie; Ogourstov, Vladimir; Seymour, Ian; Barry, Fiona; Rohan, James F.; Mac Loughlin, Ronan",Sensors (Basel),774,1

The expression patterns of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and mRNAs in the diaphragm in a rat controlled mechanical ventilation (CMV) model, however, remain to be investigated. RESULTS: The diaphragms of five male Wistar rats in a CMV group and five control Wistar rats were used to explore lncRNA and mRNA expression profiles by RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq). Muscle force measurements and immunofluorescence (IF) staining were used to verify the successful establishment of the CMV model. A total of 906 differentially expressed (DE) lncRNAs and 2,139 DE mRNAs were found in the CMV group. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses were performed to determine the biological functions or pathways of these DE mRNAs. Our results revealed that these DE mRNAs were related mainly related to complement and coagulation cascades, the PPAR signaling pathway, cholesterol metabolism, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, and the AMPK signaling pathway. Some DE lncRNAs and DE mRNAs determined by RNA-seq were validated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), which exhibited trends similar to those observed by RNA-sEq. Co-expression network analysis indicated that three selected muscle atrophy-related mRNAs (Myog, Trim63, and Fbxo32) were coexpressed with relatively newly discovered DE lncRNAs. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a novel perspective on the molecular mechanism of DE lncRNAs and mRNAs in a CMV model, and indicates that the inflammatory signaling pathway and lipid metabolism may play important roles in the pathophysiological mechanism and progression of VIDD.

Not surprisingly, these actions directly impacted demand for nonessential goods and services, but the full impact of this shock on the broader economy will depend on the nature and strength of value chains. In a world where production chains are increasingly fragmented, a shock in one industry (or a group of industries) in one country will affect other domestic industries as well as international trade, leading to impacts on production in other countries. We employ the World Input–Output Database to depict the interdependencies among both industries and countries, which provides a full representation of global value chains. By assuming a homogeneous impact on demand for nonessential goods and services around the world, we demonstrate asymmetric effects on production by industry and international trade, leading to asymmetric relative impacts on national economies. Our results indicate that if demand for nonessential goods and services decreases by 50%, the global gross domestic product will decline by 23%, leading to relative impacts that are larger in China, Indonesia, and some European countries. Also, international trade declines by almost 30%, largely due to a reduction in economic activity associated with the production of raw materials and certain types of manufacturing. This work highlights the relevancy of going beyond measuring the direct effects of COVID‐19 and provides insights into how international trade linkages will induce broader economic impacts across the globe.","Ferreira, Joao‐Pedro; Ramos, Pedro; Barata, Eduardo; Court, Christa; Cruz, Luís",,774,0

The SARS–CoV–2 PCR test showed positive results on day 3 after symptom onset. Mechanical ventilation and venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV ECMO) were initiated for respiratory function deterioration on day 8 after symptom onset. However, ECMO did not maintain adequate oxygenation, and ventilator settings did not allow lung rest. Therefore, secondary ECMO transport was performed, and the patient was transferred to our center via ECMOnet. The reduced oxygenation level was attributed to the use of a small drainage cannula with consequently reduced ECMO circulation. Replacement of the small drainage cannula was unsafe; therefore, an additional drainage cannula was inserted, and the ECMO configuration was switched to VV–V ECMO, which established sufficient ECMO circulation and improved his oxygenation levels, and ventilator settings were modified for lung rest. He was weaned off ECMO on day 14, and retransferred to the previous hospital on day 21 after symptom onset.

We consider a constant relative risk aversion (CRRA) utility maximizer investor in a complete market, with independent ambiguity-aversion levels for the three factors explaining the term structure of future prices, namely, spot prices, convenience yield (CY) and interest rates (IRs), as proposed in the seminal work of Schwartz (J Finance 52(3): 923–973, 1997). This generic investor is interested in the speculative component of the investment rather than possessing/consuming the physical commodity. We obtain closed-form solutions for optimal investments, optimal perturbations (alternative model) and value functions in line with the robust portfolio setting of Maenhout (Rev Financial Stud 17(4): 951–983, 2004). Our main focus is on the effect of convenience yield’s uncertainty on the optimal analysis. We estimate the model by applying a combination of maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) and Kalman Filter (KF) techniques, to two commodities: West Texas Intermediate (WTI) and copper future prices. The analysis demonstrates that uncertainty on the CY factor could be the largest contributor to the under-performance of a commodities portfolio, with wealth equivalent losses (WELs) in the ranges of 33% to 88% (WTI), and 7% to 31% (copper). Moreover, small variations, of up 25%, on CY’s covariance parameters could lead to a WEL of up to 40% (WTI, lesser volatility of CY).","Chen, Junhe; Escobar-Anel, Marcos",Ann Finance,774,0

The pathophysiology of AKI during sepsis is complex and multifactorial. Lower heart rate is associated with better survival in patients with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), a disease mostly caused by sepsis.

RESULTS: Fifty patients with sepsis with early renal impairment were divided in 1: 1 ratio to receive Ivabradine (group I) or not (group C). The average age of the included patients was almost 45 years, chest disorders were the main cause of sepsis in both groups. There were statistically significant differences between both groups in terms of reduction of heart rate group (I) (68.13 ± 3.34) versus (group C) (87.04 ± 3.23) and (P < 0.001) also, improvement in eGFR by Cystatin c in group (I) (103.32 ± 6.96) versus (group C) (96.25 ± 6.36) and (P < 0.001) also vasopressor dosage consumption (P < 0.001).

More recently, however, China’s competitiveness of product types 0371 and 0372 (Standard International Trade Classification) has been improving in the world market. To further develop China’s aquatic product exports, policy should aim to maintain the fisheries ecosystem, encourage seafood operators to adopt good practices, increase investment in science and technology, overcome technical barriers to trade, strengthen research on the needs, preferences, and requirements of major importing countries, expand domestic demand, and strengthen international cooperation.","Miao, Miao; Liu, Huang; Chen, Jun",Aquac Int,774,1

An interpretive qualitative research method was employed for collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data in an iterative process. An in-depth interview method was implemented to collect data from three mathematics teachers on challenges of social justice in mathematics classrooms at three public secondary schools in Kathmandu. A multi-layered thematic analysis and interpretation of the participant narratives from the interview data produced eight emergent themes: diverse students, working-class children, students' absenteeism, disengaging curriculum, students' different interests, non-participatory teaching, insufficient skills in using technology, and cultural differences. Pedagogical and policy implications are additionally considered.","Panthi, Ram Krishna; Khanal, Bishnu; Kshetree, Mukunda Prakash; Acharya, Bed Raj; Belbase, Shashidhar",SN Soc Sci,774,8

This commonly affects young children and requires early extraction. Successful removal provides immediate relief. However procedural complications can cause devastating morbidity like anoxic encephalopathy or instant death. The aim of this study is to describe the experience in our institution with two surgeons approach for removal of tracheobronchial foreign bodies by telescope and optical forceps. This is an observational study from the period of March 2010 to April 2021 in which 96 patients (59 males, 37 females; age range 3 months to 15 years) were diagnosed with foreign body aspiration. In all cases rigid bronchoscopy and FB removal under general anaesthesia was performed using the two surgeons technique. This technique was instituted once Storz make paediatric telescope (2.9 mm diameter 36 cm length), optical grasping forceps and optical suction were procured in March 2010. Aspirated material was inorganic or organic with varying location in right main bronchus, left main bronchus or the trachea. We highlight the OT setup, surgical algorithm and the advantages of this technique. Visual and tactile coordination between the two surgeons being the crux of this procedure; allows hands on mentoring of the next generation of budding surgeons in a real-life scenario without compromising patient safety.

In this work, we reveal, that the linear model based on the experimental data limited to within a small range of biaxial strains (< 0.2%), which is widely used for the non-destructive Raman study of strain with nanometer-scale spatial resolution is not valid for the binary wurtzite-structure group-III nitrides GaN and AlN. Importantly, we found that the discrepancy between the experimental values of strain and those calculated via Raman spectroscopy increases as the strain in both GaN and AlN increases. Herein, a new model has been developed to describe the strain-induced Raman frequency shift in GaN and AlN for a wide range of biaxial strains (up to 2.5%). Finally, we proposed a new approach to correlate the Raman frequency shift and strain, which is based on the lattice coherency in the epitaxial layers of superlattice structures and can be used for a wide range of materials.

Many works on antibacterial modification of cotton fabrics have been reported, while very few works were reported to endow poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) fabrics with non-leaching antibacterial function without compromising their innate physicochemical properties though PET is the most widely used fabric. Therefore, it is urgent to impart the PET fabrics with non-leaching antibacterial activity. Herein, a novel N-halamine compound, 1-chloro-3-benzophenone-5,5-dimethylhydantoin (Cl-BPDMH), was developed to be covalently bonded onto PET fabrics, rendering non-leaching antibacterial activity while negligible cytotoxicity based on contact-killing principle. Bacterial was easily adhered to Cl-BPDMH finished PET fabrics, and then it was inactivated quickly within 10 s. Furthermore, the breaking strength, breaking elongation, tearing strength, water vapor permeability, air permeability and whiteness of Cl-BPDMH finished PET fabrics were improved obviously compared to raw PET fabrics. Hence, this work developed a facile approach to fabricate multifunctional synthetic textiles to render outstanding and rapid bactericidal activity without compromising their physicochemical properties and biocompatibility.

The unavailability of virus-specific drugs has created an opportunity to identify potential therapeutic agents that can control the rapid transmission of this pandemic. Here, the mechanisms of the inhibition of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), responsible for the replication of the virus in host cells, are examined by different ligands, such as Remdesivir (RDV), Remdesivir monophosphate (RMP), and several artificially expanded genetic information systems (AEGISs) including their different sequences by employing molecular docking, MD simulations, and MM/GBSA techniques. It is found that the binding of RDV to RdRp may block the RNA binding site. However, RMP would acquire a partially flipped conformation and may allow the viral RNA to enter into the binding site. The internal dynamics of RNA and RdRp may help RMP to regain its original position, where it may inhibit the RNA-chain elongation reaction. Remarkably, AEGISs are found to obstruct the binding site of RNA. It is shown that dPdZ, a two-nucleotide sequence containing P and Z would bind to RdRp very strongly and may occupy the positions of two nucleotides in the RNA strand, thereby denying access of the substrate-binding site to the viral RNA. Thus, it is proposed that the AEGISs may act as novel therapeutic candidates against the SARS-CoV-2. However, in vivo evaluations of their potencies and toxicities are needed before using them against COVID-19.","Jena, N R; Pant, Suyash; Srivastava, Hemant Kumar",J Biomol Struct Dyn,774,1

STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We express the robustness of inferences as the amount of data that must be replaced to change the conclusion and relate this to the fragility of trial results used for dichotomous outcomes. We illustrate our approach in the context of an RCT of hydroxychloroquine on pneumonia in COVID-19 patients and a cumulative meta-analysis of the effect of antihypertensive treatments on stroke. RESULTS: We developed the Robustness of an Inference to Replacement (RIR), which quantifies how many treatment cases with positive outcomes would have to be replaced with hypothetical patients who did not receive a treatment to change an inference. The RIR addresses known limitations of the Fragility Index by accounting for the observed rates of outcomes. It can be used for varying thresholds for inference, including clinical importance. CONCLUSION: Because the RIR expresses uncertainty in terms of patient experiences, it is more relatable to stakeholders than P-values alone. It helps identify when results are statistically significant, but conclusions are not robust, while considering the rareness of events in the underlying data.","Frank, Kenneth A; Lin, Qinyun; Maroulis, Spiro; Mueller, Anna S; Xu, Ran; Rosenberg, Joshua M; Hayter, Christopher S; Mahmoud, Ramy A; Kolak, Marynia; Dietz, Thomas; Zhang, Lixin",J Clin Epidemiol,774,26
