3750,3750,3750,Zika Outbreak Emergency Preparedness and Response of Malaysian Private Healthcare Professionals: Are They Ready?,19.158953,4.0542955,2019-03-19,"Zika virus has been declared as a public health emergency of international concern. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention has issued guidelines reminding healthcare workers about the importance of taking steps to prevent the spread of Zika virus, how to test and isolate patients suspected of carrying the Zika virus, and how to protect themselves from infection. Therefore, it is of utmost importance for healthcare professionals to be fully aware of Zika virus preparedness, and response measures should an outbreak occur in Malaysia in order to quickly and efficiently contain the outbreak, ensure the safety of individual or healthcare personnel safety, as well as to prevent further spreading of the disease. This research aims to show how prepared Malaysian healthcare professionals are against Zika virus and how well can they respond during an outbreak. In total, 504 healthcare professionals (128 general practitioners, 215 community pharmacists, 161 nurses) from private health clinics were the target population of the four states of Malaysia where Zika cases suspected. The sample size of each category was calculated by using a formula for estimating the population proportion. An additional 10% of the calculated sample size was added to compensate the non-response rate. The Center For Disease Control and Prevention and World Health Organisation provided a checklist to assess how prepared healthcare professionals are for an Zika outbreak. This checklist was modified to a questionnaire in order to assess health care professionals’ preparedness and response to the Zika outbreak. Community pharmacists are still lacking in their preparedness and perceived response to the Zika outbreak compared to the general practitioners in the private sector. Hence community pharmacists should attend training given by the Ministry of Health Malaysia as a continuing education, which may help them to respond during a Zika outbreak.","Rajiah, Kingston; Maharajan, Mari Kannan; Yin, Pua Yin; Yee, Yap Wei; Lin, Wong Wan; Kean, Chew Hui",Microorganisms,425,1

In addition, viruses encode for an array of non-structural accessory proteins important for replication, spread, and immune evasion in the host and are often linked to virus pathogenesis. Most virus accessory proteins are non-essential for growth in cell culture because of the simplicity of the infection barriers or because they have roles only during a state of the infection that does not exist in cell cultures (i.e., tissue-specific functions), or finally because host factors in cell culture can complement their absence. For these reasons, the study of most nonessential viral factors is more complex and requires development of suitable cell culture systems and in vivo models. Approximately half of the proteins encoded by the herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) genome have been classified as non-essential. These proteins have essential roles in vivo in counteracting antiviral responses, facilitating the spread of the virus from the sites of initial infection to the peripheral nervous system, where it establishes lifelong reservoirs, virus pathogenesis, and other regulatory roles during infection. Understanding the functions of the non-essential proteins of herpesviruses is important to understand mechanisms of viral pathogenesis but also to harness properties of these viruses for therapeutic purposes. Here, we have provided a comprehensive summary of the functions of HSV-1 non-essential proteins.","Dogrammatzis, Christos; Waisner, Hope; Kalamvoki, Maria",Viruses,425,1

The utilitarian and prioritarian value of risk reduction over a whole lifetime,19.09495,2.3204298,2021-01-11,"BACKGROUND: Fresh gas decoupling is a feature of the modern anesthesia workstation, where the fresh gas flow (FGF) is diverted into the reservoir bag and is not added to the delivered tidal volume, which thus remains constant. The present study aimed to investigate the entraining of the atmospheric air into the anesthesia breathing circuit in case the reservoir bag was disconnected. METHODS: We conducted a simulator-based study, where the METI HPS simulator was connected to the anesthesia workstation. The effect of the disconnected reservoir bag was evaluated using oxygen (O(2)) and air or oxygen and nitrous oxide (N(2)O) as a carrier gas at different FGF rates. We disconnected the reservoir bag for 10 min during the maintenance phase. We recorded values for inspiratory O(2), N(2)O, and sevoflurane. The time constant of the exponential process was estimated during reservoir bag disconnection. RESULTS: The difference of O(2), N(2)O and sevoflurane concentrations, before, during, and after reservoir bag disconnection was statistically significant at 0.5, 1, and 2 L/min of FGF (p < 0.001). The largest decrease of the inspired O(2) concentrations (F(I)O(2)) was detected in the case of oxygen and air as the carrier gas and an FGF of 1 L/min, when oxygen decreased from median [25th–75th percentile] 55.00% [54.00–56.00] to median 39.50% [38.00–42.50] (p < 0.001). The time constant for F(I)O(2) during reservoir bag disconnection in oxygen and air as the carrier gas, were median 2.5, 2.5, and 1.5 min in FGF of 0.5, 1.0, and 2 L/min respectively. CONCLUSIONS: During the disconnection of the anesthesia reservoir bag, the process of pharmacokinetics takes place faster compared to the wash-in and wash-out pharmacokinetic properties in the circle breathing system. The time constant was affected by the FGF rate, as well as the gradient of anesthetic gases between the anesthesia circle system and atmospheric air.","Križmarić, Miljenko; Maver, Uroš; Zdravković, Marko; Mekiš, Dušan",BMC Anesthesiol,425,5

Due to the sporadic nature of spillover events and limited availability of data, developing and validating robust, spatially explicit, predictions is challenging. Recent efforts have begun to make progress in this direction by capitalizing on machine learning methodologies. An important weakness of existing approaches, however, is that they generally rely on combining human and reservoir infection data during the training process and thus conflate risk attributable to the prevalence of the pathogen in the reservoir population with the risk attributed to the realized rate of spillover into the human population. Because effective planning of interventions requires that these components of risk be disentangled, we developed a multi-layer machine learning framework that separates these processes. Our approach begins by training models to predict the geographic range of the primary reservoir and the subset of this range in which the pathogen occurs. The spillover risk predicted by the product of these reservoir specific models is then fit to data on realized patterns of historical spillover into the human population. The result is a geographically specific spillover risk forecast that can be easily decomposed and used to guide effective intervention. Applying our method to Lassa virus, a zoonotic pathogen that regularly spills over into the human population across West Africa, results in a model that explains a modest but statistically significant portion of geographic variation in historical patterns of spillover. When combined with a mechanistic mathematical model of infection dynamics, our spillover risk model predicts that 897,700 humans are infected by Lassa virus each year across West Africa, with Nigeria accounting for more than half of these human infections.","Basinski, Andrew J.; Fichet-Calvet, Elisabeth; Sjodin, Anna R.; Varrelman, Tanner J.; Remien, Christopher H.; Layman, Nathan C.; Bird, Brian H.; Wolking, David J.; Monagin, Corina; Ghersi, Bruno M.; Barry, Peter A.; Jarvis, Michael A.; Gessler, Paul E.; Nuismer, Scott L.",PLoS Comput Biol,425,1

We aimed to describe the trends in VAS coverage and estimated the associated reductions in child mortality. VAS coverage data obtained from the District Health Information System and the Demographic and Health Surveys were linked to child mortality data from the United Nations Interagency Group for Child Mortality Estimation (UN IGME). The number of child deaths averted was modelled assuming 12% and 24% reductions in all‐cause mortality. From 2006 to 2011, VAS was delivered through campaigns, and coverage was above 85%. However, from 2011 onwards, VAS delivery was integrated to the routine health system, and the coverage declined to <60% with significant disparities by wealth quintile and rural–urban residence. VAS has saved between 167,563 to 376,030 child lives (2005–2019), but additional lives (>42,000) could have been saved with a universal coverage (95%). Inconsistent supply of vitamin A capsules, but more importantly, low access to health care, and the limited contact opportunities for children after 24 months may have contributed to the declining VAS coverage. Any changes in target or scale‐up should thus consider these spatial and socioeconomic variations. Increasing the coverage of VAS and closing the equity gap in access to nutrition services is critical. However, with alternative programmes like vitamin A fortification being set‐up, the benefits and safety of VAS need to be closely monitored, particularly in areas where there will be overlap.","Laillou, Arnaud; Baye, Kaleab; Zelalem, Meseret; Chitekwe, Stanley",Matern Child Nutr,425,1

Mixed Method Study,19.10179,3.6959026,2015-02-01,"BACKGROUND: The rates of physical inactivity and related cancer incidence and mortality are disproportionately high in the Deep South region in the United States, a rural, medically underserved region with a large African American population compared with the rest of the nation. Given this region’s lower rates of literacy and internet access, interactive voice response (IVR) system–automated telephone-based interventions have the potential to help overcome physical activity intervention barriers (literacy, internet access, costs, and transportation) but have yet to be extended to rural, underserved populations, such as in the Deep South. Thus, extensive formative research is being conducted to develop and beta test the Deep South IVR System–Supported Active Lifestyle intervention in preparation for dissemination in rural Alabama counties. OBJECTIVE: This paper aims to describe the design and rationale of an ongoing efficacy trial of the Deep South IVR System–Supported Active Lifestyle intervention. METHODS: A two-arm randomized controlled trial will be conducted to compare a 12-month physical activity intervention versus a wait-list control condition in 240 underactive adults from 6 rural Alabama counties. The Deep South IVR System–Supported Active Lifestyle intervention is based on the Social Cognitive Theory and includes IVR-automated physical activity–related phone counseling (daily in months 0-3, twice weekly in months 4-6, and weekly in months 7-12) and support from local rural county coordinators with the University of Alabama O’Neal Comprehensive Cancer Center Community Outreach and Engagement Office. The primary outcome is weekly minutes of moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity (7-day physical activity recall; accelerometry) at baseline, 6 months, 12 months, and 18 months. Rural Active Living Assessments will be conducted in each rural county to assess walkability, assess recreational amenities, and inform future environment and policy efforts. RESULTS: This study was funded in March 2019 and approved by the institutional review board of the University of Alabama at Birmingham in April 2019. As of February 2020, start-up activities (hiring and training staff and purchasing supplies) were completed. Study recruitment and assessments began in September 2020 and are ongoing. As of February 2021, a total of 43 participants have been enrolled in Dallas County, 42 in Sumter County, and 51 in Greene County. CONCLUSIONS: IVR-supported phone counseling has great potential for addressing physical activity barriers (eg, culture, literacy, cost, or transportation) and reducing related rural health disparities in this region.

In addition to these disorders, pregnancy can affect numerous preexisting neurologic conditions, including epilepsy, brain tumors, and intracerebral bleeding from cerebral aneurysm or arteriovenous malformations. Intracranial complications related to pregnancy can expose patients to a high risk of intracranial hypertension (IHT). Unfortunately, at present, the therapeutic measures that are generally adopted for the control of elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) in the general population have not been examined in pregnant patients, and their efficacy and safety for the mother and the fetus is still unknown. In addition, no specific guidelines for the application of the staircase approach, including escalating treatments with increasing intensity of level, for the management of IHT exist for this population. Although some of basic measures can be considered safe even in pregnant patients (management of stable hemodynamic and respiratory function, optimization of systemic physiology), some other interventions, such as hyperventilation, osmotic therapy, hypothermia, barbiturates, and decompressive craniectomy, can lead to specific concerns for the safety of both mother and fetus. The aim of this review is to summarize the neurological pathophysiological changes occurring during pregnancy and explore the effects of the possible therapeutic interventions applied to the general population for the management of IHT during pregnancy, taking into consideration ethical and clinical concerns as well as the decision for the timing of treatment and delivery.","Godoy, Daniel Agustin; Robba, Chiara; Paiva, Wellingson Silva; Rabinstein, Alejandro A.",Neurocrit Care,425,12

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this paper, we employed the fixed-point theory in developing the uniqueness and existence of a solution of fractional order HIV/AIDS model having Caputo-Fabrizio operator. This approach adopted in this work is not conventional when solving biological models by fractional derivatives. RESULTS: The results showed that the model has two equilibrium points namely, disease-free, and endemic equilibrium points, respectively. We showed conditions necessitating the existence of the endemic equilibrium point and showed that the disease-free equilibrium point is locally asymptotically stable. We also tested the stability of our solution using the iterative Laplace transform method on our model which was also shown stable agreeing with the disease-free equilibrium. CONCLUSIONS: Numerical simulations of our model showed clear comparison with our analytical results. The numerical solutions show that given fractional operator like the Caputo-Fabrizio operator, it is less noisy and hence plays a major role in making a precise decision and gives room or opportunity (‘freedom’) to use data of specific patients as the model can be easily adjusted to accommodate this, as it a better fit for the patients’ data and provide meaningful predictions. Finally, the result showed the advantage of using fractional order derivative in the analysis of the dynamics of HIV/AIDS over the classical case.","Unaegbu, Ebenezar Nkemjika; Onah, Ifeanyi Sunday; Oyesanya, Moses Oladotun",Afr J Infect Dis,425,1

This food insecurity can be measured by utilizing the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS). More fundamentally, COVID‐19 heightens household concern about the capacity of the Canadian food system to ensure food availability. Despite surges in demand and supply chain disruptions, we currently do not observe broad, rapid appreciation in food prices. This suggests that there is an adequate supply of food for the near term. There is less certainty over intermediate and longer time periods because so many factors are in flux, particularly the rate of increases in sicknesses and deaths across the country and globally. Data on these health factors and elements of the food supply chain are needed to predict beyond a short time frame.

Methods: Total circulating exosomes (CD9(+)-Ex) and those derived from T-cells (CD3(+)-Ex) and monocytes (CD14(+)-Ex) were quantified by flow cytometry in 82 SLE patients and 32 controls. Leukocyte subsets and serum cytokines were analyzed by flow cytometry or by immunoassays. IFN-score was evaluated by real time RT-PCR in whole blood samples from a subgroup of 73 patients and 24 controls. Results: Activation markers (IFNR1 and BLyS) on monocytes, neutrophils and B-cells correlated inversely with circulating exosomes (CD9(+)-Ex, CD3(+)-Ex, and CD14(+)-Ex) in controls but directly with CD3(+)-Ex in patients (all p < 0.05). Although CD9(+)-Ex were increased in SLE, no differences were found in CD3(+)-Ex, supporting that exosome content accounts for this opposite role. Interestingly, CD4(+)CD28(null) cells correlated with CD3(+)-Ex in patients and controls, and displayed similar associations with leukocyte subsets in both groups. Additionally, CD3(+)-Ex correlated in patients with the expression of CD25 in CD4(+)CD28(null) cells. Furthermore, the activated status of this senescent subset was related to IFNα serum levels in controls and to IFN-score in SLE patients. Finally, patients presenting high IFN-score, in addition to elevated CD25(+)CD28(null) cells associated with the activation of myeloid cells, displayed higher levels of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Conclusion: Our results support a relationship between T-cell exosomes and cellular subsets in SLE according to type I IFN-signaling, which could amplify chronic immune activation and excessive cytokine/chemokine response.","López, Patricia; Rodríguez-Carrio, Javier; Caminal-Montero, Luis; Suárez, Ana",Front Med (Lausanne),425,16

Respiratory bacterial co-infection frequently was invoked. The purpose of this study was to determine the respiratory pathogen distribution and antibiotic prescribing patterns in hospitalized patients with CoVID-19. METHODS: Patients with a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) ICD-10 code and/or positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) hospitalized between March 1 and May 31, 2020 were included. Antibiotic utilization (patient days of therapy-pDOT) was collected for the institution during this period and two years prior. Respiratory microbiologic cultures were reviewed to examine the frequency of co-infection on presentation, categorized as within 3 calendar days from admission or afterward. The relationship of antibiotic utilization to positive cultures was also categorized. RESULTS: Of the 7,969 encounters, 829 were ICD-10 coded and/or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive and 196 (23.6%) had positive respiratory cultures. 89.8% of patients had endotracheal samples, the rest were isolated from sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage (17.4% and 6.6%, respectively). Patients were more likely to isolate commensal respiratory flora (108 versus 78 patients within the first 3 days of presentation. Notable isolates such as Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, were more often isolated after 3 days of hospitalization. While the CoVID-19 average hospital census was only 14.7% of the total, antibiotic utilization, (pDOT/1000) was 2.3 times higher, 831.9 versus 368.3 across the institution. During similar periods in 2018 and 2019, days of therapy overall were lower. For CoVID-19 infected patients, the frequency of antibiotic initiation was 73.2%.

The trigger point for blood transfusions for these patients may be different from existing transfusion guidelines. This study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a new scoring strategy for use in guiding transfusion decisions in patients with CAD. METHODS: A multicenter randomized controlled trial was conducted at three third-level grade-A hospitals from January 2015 to May 2018. Data of 254 patients in a Cardiac Peri-Operative Transfusion Trigger Score (cPOTTS) group and 246 patients in a group receiving conventional evaluation of the need for transfusion (conventional group) were analysed. The requirements for transfusion and the per capita consumption of red blood cells (RBCs) were compared between groups. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics of the two groups were comparable. Logistic regression analyses revealed no significant differences between the two groups in primary outcomes (1-year mortality and perioperative ischemic cardiac events), secondary outcomes (shock, infections, and renal impairment), ICU admission, and ICU stay duration. However, patients in the cPOTTS group had significantly shorter hospital stays, lower hospital costs, lower utilization rate and lower per capita consumption of transfused RBCs than controls. Stratified analyses revealed no significant differences between groups in associations between baseline characteristics and perioperative ischemic cardiac events, except for hemofiltration or dialysis and NYHA class in I.

We argue that when stressed employees share knowledge, they can expand their knowledge base and thereby enhance their innovative potential. Consistent with our hypothesis, multiple regression analysis results based on a sample of 61 R&D employees of UK and US technology‐based firms show that knowledge sharing moderated the relationship between COVID‐19‐induced job stress and employee innovation, such that the relationship was negative when knowledge sharing was lower but became positive when knowledge sharing was higher.

AIM: To investigate aspects of knowledge and attitudes towards mental illness of a group of private and state-employed non-specialist medical doctors. METHOD: Doctors in the state sector who were working at a primary healthcare level and who were not working towards, or did not hold, a specialist qualification were considered eligible for the study. Doctors in the private sector who were working as general practitioners and who did not hold a specialist qualification were considered eligible for the study. Data were collected by means of a self-administered questionnaire. A link to the study questionnaire, information about the study, details of the researcher and matters pertaining to informed consent were emailed to potential participants. RESULTS: Of the 140 practitioners who responded to the survey, 51.4% (n = 72) worked in the state sector, 41.4% (n = 58) worked in the private sector and 7.1% (n = 10) worked in both the state and private sectors (χ(2)(1) = 45.31, p < 0.010). The majority (> 50%) of participants in all three groups had a positive attitude towards mental illness (χ(2)(2) = 1.52, p = 0.468). Although there were no significant associations between attitude and socio-demographic characteristics (p > 0.05), male SS doctors reported feeling less comfortable when dealing with mentally ill patients (p = 0.015); SS doctors who did not have family contact with mental illness were less likely to feel that mentally ill patients did not pose a risk to others (p = 0.007), and PS doctors under the age of 35 years were more likely to feel adequately trained to treat mental illness (p = 0.026). The majority (> 50%) of participants in all three groups had an adequate level of knowledge of mental illness (modal scores = 10). There were no significant associations between knowledge and socio-demographic characteristics (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Despite the findings of a positive attitude and adequate knowledge of mental illness amongst the participants of this study, it is recommended that more targeted interventions are established to further improve mental health awareness and knowledge of doctors at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels of study.","Minty, Yumna; Moosa, Mahomed Y.H.; Jeenah, Fatima Y.",S Afr J Psychiatr,425,10

Although the actual role of neuro-imaging in psychiatry remains unclear, it is used to strengthen clinical evidence in making psychiatric diagnoses. AIM: To analyse the records of inpatients referred for neuro-imaging (computerised tomography [CT] and/or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] scans) to determine the proportion of abnormal neuro-imaging results and, if any, factors associated with abnormal neuro-imaging results. SETTING: This study was conducted at the Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Academic Hospital (CMJAH) situated in Johannesburg, South Africa. METHODS: This was a quantitative retrospective record review. All adult psychiatric inpatients who had undergone a CT and/or MRI scan during 01 January 2014 to 31 December 2015 were included. Out-patients or patients admitted in the medical wards were excluded from the study. All neuro-imaging referrals were identified from hospital records and their demographics, scan characteristics and diagnoses were subsequently captured. RESULTS: A total of 1040 patients were admitted to the CMJAH psychiatric unit, of which 213 (20.5%) underwent neuro-imaging tests. Of the 213 scans performed, 74 were abnormal, representing a yield of 34.7%. The most common reported pathology was atrophy (n = 22, 29.7%). There was no statistically significant association between age group (χ(2) = 3.9, p = 0.8), gender (χ(2) = 1.3; p = 0.5), psychiatric diagnoses and abnormal scans. However, there were trends towards an association with comorbid HIV infection (χ(2) = 3.476, p = 0.062) and comorbid substance abuse (χ(2) = 2.286, p = 0.091). CONCLUSION: This study supports the need for clear clinical indications to justify the cost-effective use of neuro-imaging in psychiatry. This study’s high yield of abnormal CT scans, although similar to other studies, advocates that HIV positive testing and the presence of focal neurological signs will improve the yield further.","Letlotlo, Bokang L.; Lumu, Lavinia D.; Moosa, Mahomed Y.H.; Jeenah, Fatima Y.",S Afr J Psychiatr,425,17

Recently, physical activity has been suggested to improve the quality of life and course of disease in adult IBD patients. The aim of this study was to investigate physical functioning in paediatric IBD patients and to determine the effects of a tailored 12-week lifestyle intervention including a physical training program. METHODS: Figure 1 shows our study design and measurements. The tailored 12-week lifestyle intervention consisted of 3 strenuous physical training sessions a week and dietary advice. Effects on exercise capacity, endurance, physical activity levels, disease activity, quality of life, and fatigue were measured in paediatric IBD patients. Mild disease activity was defined as a PCDAI between 10 - 27.5 or PUCAI between 10 - 34. [Image: see text] RESULTS: Sixteen paediatric IBD patients (median age 15 [9 - 17]) were included, 13 patients successfully completed the training program, 2 patients are still participating. At baseline, most patients had mild disease activity (n=9). Patients had reduced exercise capacity (76.8%±17.7% of predicted PeakVO(2) , and reduced physical activity levels as shown by 80.3%±7.4% of measured time being spent in sedentary activity. PCDAI/PUCAI scores decreased significantly over the intervention period (13.8±11.7 vs. 3.65±4.5, P=0.002). Fecal calprotectin also decreased significantly (400 [18–3089] vs. 128 [20–2704], P=0.041). All patients but one had no changes in medical regimens before or during the lifestyle intervention that could have influenced disease activity. After the 12-week lifestyle intervention period, 9 out of 13 patients were in clinical remission. Maximum walked distance increased significantly (503±69 vs. 540±77 meters, P=0.001), although PeakVO(2) and percentage of time spent in moderate-to-vigorous activity did not. Patients improved on overall quality of life measured by the Impact III questionnaire (+2.4 points, p=0.017). The Child Health Questionnaire showed a significant improvement on the child-reported physical functioning scale and on 5 parent-reported scales of quality of life. Child-reported fatigue measured by the PedsQol MFS did not improve significantly, parents-reported fatigue did. No changes were found on mentioned outcomes during the control period. After baseline measurements, the COVID-19 lock-down period started, possibly affecting normal daytime activities of the patients during the lifestyle intervention period. CONCLUSION: A 12-week tailored physical training program including dietry advice is safe and beneficial for paediatric IBD patients and may contribute to better control of inflammation.","Scheffers, L; van den Berg, L E; Pijnenburg, M W; Utens, E M; Dieleman, G C; van der Ploeg, A T; Helbing, W A; Escher, J C",J Crohns Colitis,425,1

These trade instruments were ideologically incoherent, but the administration designed them so domestic firms could compete against foreign ones and so the US to dominate the world order. These policies came from debates in the 1980s when the Reagan administration created a strategy to stem manufacturing decline as European and Asian economies grew. When we see the 1980s as a confrontational moment for the USA in the world, we can better understand the origins and practice of the Trump administration's strategic vision on trade policy in the 2010s.","Furse, Thomas",Int Polit,425,29

The unplanned lockdown imposed by the Indian government affected paddy transplantation, a labour‐intensive activity in Punjab primarily due to interstate restrictions on movement. Drawing on a primary survey in a village from the Malwa region of Punjab, the paper examines the changes in agrarian relations in rural Punjab due to the Covid‐19 pandemic by critically analysing the dynamics of capital labour relations. The restriction on labour movement and unilateral imposition of transplantation wage rates by a few Panchayats in Punjab (dominated by capitalist landlords and rich peasants) has intensified class conflict in the state. The Punjab government's policies, which are driven by the capitalist landlords and rich peasants, have played a significant role in the increased exploitation of workers. The paper concludes with a brief evaluation of the changes induced by Covid‐19 in the agrarian political economy of Punjab.","Kaur, Navpreet; Kaur, Amanpreet",,425,16

Exacerbations are connected with changes in the microbiological landscape in the bronchi due to a violation of their immune homeostasis. Many metabolic and immune processes involved in COPD progression are associated with bacterial colonization of the bronchi. The objective of this review is the analysis of the molecular mechanisms of lipid metabolism and immune response disorders in the lungs in COPD exacerbations. The complex role of lipid metabolism disorders in the pathogenesis of some infections is only beginning to be understood, however, there are already fewer and fewer doubts even now about its significance both in the pathogenesis of infectious exacerbations of COPD and in general in the progression of the disease. It is shown that the lipid rafts of the plasma membranes of cells are involved in many processes related to the detection of pathogens, signal transduction, the penetration of pathogens into the cell. Smoking disrupts the normally proceeded processes of lipid metabolism in the lungs, which is a part of the COPD pathogenesis.","Kotlyarov, Stanislav; Kotlyarova, Anna",Int J Mol Sci,425,8

In particular, the treatment of small intestinal ulcerative lesions in asymptomatic patients with no symptoms, normal physical examinations, and normal blood test findings is not well documented. According to a summary of capsule endoscopy studies in healthy subjects, approximately 10% of subjects have small intestinal mucosal breaks. The number of mucosal breaks in these instances is approximately 1-3. We examined small intestinal mucosal breaks in healthy subjects recruited from our past two studies. Mucosal breaks were observed in approximately 10% of subjects, and the average number was 0.24 ± 1.21. The number of mucosal breaks in the small intestine was correlated with body mass index and was significantly higher in Helicobacter pylori-infected subjects and higher in males. These results indicate that 1-2 small ulcerative lesions, such as erosions in the small intestine, can be considered to be in the normal range, and close examination is not required. It is assumed that a follow-up medical examination is required for such asymptomatic persons. The presence of many small ulcerative lesions or an unequivocal ulcer indicates an abnormality for which close examination is desired. However, in many cases, it is sufficient to scrutinize after detecting anemia, but it is difficult to make a judgment due to insufficient reports, and future studies are required.","Fujimori, Shunji",World J Gastroenterol,425,5

A number of port cities of Ukraine, such as Odessa, Izmail, Kherson, and Mykolaiv, significantly contribute to the pollution of the sea water areas with IAS. Invasive alien species that are present in sea water are supplied together with the latter into ballast tanks (to maintain balance, list, and stability of ships) and end up in the sea even after passing through the ballast cleaning system, thereby securing themselves in certain water areas and ceasing to play the sanitary role; on the contrary, they become pests, i.e., a threat to the World Ocean.

Given that Japanese companies often agree on jointly owning IP generated in the process of software development and other co-development projects, we analyze the risks of joint ownership compared to non-exclusive licenses. To further illustrate such risks that may be even more significant in cross-border constellations, we conduct a comparative study on the actions that a party commissioning the development of new software can take without obtaining the software developer’s consent under Japanese, US and German patent and copyright law. Furthermore, we examine certain unresolved issues that may arise in the case of a party’s insolvency or the impact of force majeure events, and provide suggestions on how to address these when drafting and negotiating IP license agreements.","Matsumoto, Kei; Rademacher, Christoph; Suga, Ayako",,425,1

Prematurity presents multiple opportunities to disrupt cardiorespiratory regulation, leading to expressions of apnea of prematurity, periodic breathing, and inappropriate cardiovascular responses to apnea. Failed breathing control can result from altered breathing drives, typically arising from untimely development of sensory or motor coordination processes. Some drives, such as temperature, are a special concern in neonates with low body mass, enhancing susceptibility to rapid body cooling. Chemical drives, such as pH or CO(2) or O(2), may be inadequately developed; in some conditions, such as congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS), breathing responses to CO(2) or low O(2) may be reduced or absent, and coupling of cardiovascular responses to breathing changes are abolished. Sleep states exert profound influences on both chemical and temperature drives, with rapid eye movement (REM) sleep potentially modifying descending temperature influences, and state transitions significantly altering respiratory responses to chemical stimuli. In addition, neonates spend the majority of time in REM sleep, a state which induces a generalized inhibition of skeletal muscle activity that abolishes muscle tone to upper airway and thoracic wall muscles, enhancing the likelihood for obstructive sleep apnea. Although disrupted regulatory drives can often be replaced by positive (or negative) pressure ventilation, such as continuous positive airway pressure or enhanced by manipulating neurotransmitter action via caffeine, those approaches may exert negative consequences in the long term; the lungs of neonates, especially premature infants, are fragile, and easily injured by positive pressure. The consequences of caffeine use, acting directly on neural receptors, although seemingly innocuous in the near-term, may have long-term concerns and disrupts the integrity of sleep. The developmental breathing field needs improved means to support ventilation when one or more drives to respiration fail, and when the cardiovascular system, depending heavily on interactions with breathing, is compromised. Neuromodulatory procedures which manipulate the vestibular system to stabilize breathing or use tactile or proprioceptive stimuli to activate long-established reflexive mechanisms coupling limb movement with respiratory efforts can provide support for central and obstructive apnea, as well as for periodic breathing and cardiovascular action, particularly during sleep.","Harper, Ronald M.; Kesavan, Kalpashri",Front Pediatr,425,1

However, many factors influence recovery and quantification of SARS-CoV-2 from wastewater, complicating data interpretation. Specifically, these factors may differentially affect the measured virus concentration, depending on the laboratory methods used to perform the test. Many laboratories add a proxy virus to wastewater samples to determine losses associated with concentration and extraction of viral RNA. While measuring recovery of a proxy virus is an important process control, in this piece, we describe the caveats and limitations to the interpretation of this control, including that it typically does not account for losses during RNA extraction. We recommend reporting the directly measured concentration data alongside the measured recovery efficiency, rather than attempting to correct the concentration for recovery efficiency. Even though the ability to directly compare SARS-CoV-2 concentrations from different sampling locations determined using different methods is limited, concentration data (uncorrected for recovery) can be useful for public health response.","Kantor, Rose S; Nelson, Kara L; Greenwald, Hannah D; Kennedy, Lauren C",Environmental science & technology,425,17

Older women who experience psychosocial loss are more likely to be dissatisfied with their life and feel more depressive and lonelier than their male counterparts. Among those who experience psychosocial loss, older people living in rural communities have a higher level of life satisfaction, while living in urban areas may counteract some of the positive impact of psychological growth on reducing the frequency of feeling depressed and lonely.

It is assumed that almost one third of these infections include the lower respiratory tract (LRTI), e. g. acute bronchitis, acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), community- or hospital-acquired pneumonia and influenza. Due to a lack of sufficient and valid investigations to prove the presence of respiratory viruses their impact in the pathogenesis of lower respiratory tract infection has probably been underestimated for a long time. Therefore, there might have been many cases of unnecessary antibiotic treatment, especially in cases of acute bronchitis or acute exacerbations of COPD, because of an assumed bacteriological cause. With the introduction of more sensitive investigational procedures, such as polymerase chain reaction, it is possible to sufficiently prove respiratory viruses and therefore illuminate their role in the pathogenesis of lower respiratory tract infections of the adult. We have reviewed the current literature on the impact of viruses in lower respiratory tract infections to elucidate the role of viruses in the pathogenesis of lower respiratory tract infections. The preceding parts of this series provided an introduction to the frequently found viruses, pathogenesis, and diagnostic procedures (part I) as well as common viral infections of the lower respiratory tract (part II). The present 3 (rd) part deals with therapy for and prevention of viral LRTI.","Ott, S R; Lepper, P M; Hauptmeier, B; Bals, R; Pletz, M W; Schumann, C; Steininger, C; Kleines, M; Geerdes-Fenge, H",Pneumologie,425,26

The determination of the relevant parameters controlling foam drainage and coarsening today remains a major issue: are the physical parameters (like bubble size and liquid fraction) sufficient to define a foam and to predict its evolution, or do the chemical components also matter? And if these foam components are important, one has to determine by which mechanisms, and which microscopic parameters involved in these mechanisms are eventually crucial. I report here recent experimental results, shedding light on these issues. It allows us to summarize how the surfactant, the liquid bulk properties, and the gas modify or not the drainage and coarsening features. The coupling between drainage and coarsening is also discussed, as well as the role of the experimental conditions (sample height, shape or foam uniformity).","Saint-Jalmes, Arnaud",Soft matter,425,32

METHODS In this descriptive study, 70 pregnant women aged 17-41 years with COVID-19 who were hospitalized from early March to late April 2020 were enrolled. Sampling was performed by census and from all hospitals in Guilan. The research instruments included a researcher-made questionnaire, including demographic characteristics, clinical symptoms, medical examinations, and paraclinical results. Data were analyzed with SPSS version 16. Frequency and percent were used to describe qualitative variables; for quantitative variables, if they were normally distributed, mean and standard deviation were used, and if they were non-normal, median and interquartile range (IQR) were used. RESULTS The most severe symptoms recorded in mothers at the time of hospitalization were fever (47%), shortness of breath (16%) and cough (15%), respectively. One of 68 (1%) was in the severe stage of the disease and two mothers (2%) were in critical condition and admitted to the intensive care unit and finally died. Fifty-five of 66 women (83%) had lymphopenia, 22 of 42 (52%) tested positive on PCR, and 30 of 33 (90%) had an increase in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels.Results showed that 15 of 32 patients who gave birth had preterm delivery (46%). CONCLUSION The most common manifestations of the disease in pregnant women were fever, cough and shortness of breath, and in some cases muscle pain. The most common laboratory finding in infected mothers was lymphopenia. Complications of pregnancy and childbirth in women included an increase in cesarean delivery.","Kazemi Aski, Soudabeh; Sharami, Seyedeh Hajar; Hosseinzadeh, Fatemeh; Hesni, Ezat; Dalil Heirati, Seyedeh Fatemeh; Ghalandari, Maryam; Mousavi, Atefeh",Archives of Iranian medicine,425,10

More than 3.1 million have died from Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), the illness caused by SARS-CoV-2. The virus affects mainly the upper respiratory tract and the lungs causing pneumonias of varying severity. Moreover, via direct and indirect pathogenetic mechanisms, SARS-CoV-2 may lead to a variety of extrapulmonary as well as vascular manifestations. METHODS Based on a systematic literature search via PubMed, original research articles, meta-analyses, reviews, and case reports representing the current scientific knowledge regarding diagnostic imaging of COVID-19 were selected. Focusing on the imaging appearance of pulmonary and extrapulmonary manifestations as well as indications for imaging, these data were summarized in the present review article and correlated with basic pathophysiologic mechanisms. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION Typical signs of COVID-19 pneumonia are multifocal, mostly bilateral, rounded, polycyclic or geographic ground-glass opacities and/or consolidations with mainly peripheral distribution. In severe cases, peribronchovascular lung zones are affected as well. Other typical signs are the ""crazy paving"" pattern and the halo and reversed halo (the latter two being less common). Venous thromboembolism (and pulmonary embolism in particular) is the most frequent vascular complication of COVID-19. However, arterial thromboembolic events like ischemic strokes, myocardial infarctions, and systemic arterial emboli also occur at higher rates. The most frequent extrapulmonary organ manifestations of COVID-19 affect the central nervous system, the heart, the hepatobiliary system, and the gastrointestinal tract. Usually, they can be visualized in imaging studies as well. The most important imaging modality for COVID-19 is chest CT. Its main purpose is not to make the primary diagnosis, but to differentiate COVID-19 from other (pulmonary) pathologies, to estimate disease severity, and to detect concomitant diseases and complications. KEY POINTS · Typical signs of COVID-19 pneumonia are multifocal, mostly peripheral ground-glass opacities/consolidations.. · Imaging facilitates differential diagnosis, estimation of disease severity, and detection of complications.. · Venous thromboembolism (especially pulmonary embolism) is the predominant vascular complication of COVID-19.. · Arterial thromboembolism (e. g., ischemic strokes, myocardial infarctions) occurs more frequently as well.. · The most common extrapulmonary manifestations affect the brain, heart, hepatobiliary system, and gastrointestinal system..

However, the prevalence estimates of these disorders vary between studies. Objective To estimate the prevalence of depression, depressive symptoms, and suicidal ideation in medical students. Data Sources and Study Selection Systematic search of EMBASE, ERIC, MEDLINE, psycARTICLES, and psycINFO without language restriction for studies on the prevalence of depression, depressive symptoms, or suicidal ideation in medical students published before September 17, 2016. Studies that were published in the peer-reviewed literature and used validated assessment methods were included. Data Extraction and Synthesis Information on study characteristics; prevalence of depression or depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation; and whether students who screened positive for depression sought treatment was extracted independently by 3 investigators. Estimates were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis. Differences by study-level characteristics were estimated using stratified meta-analysis and meta-regression. Main Outcomes and Measures Point or period prevalence of depression, depressive symptoms, or suicidal ideation as assessed by validated questionnaire or structured interview. Results Depression or depressive symptom prevalence data were extracted from 167 cross-sectional studies (n = 116 628) and 16 longitudinal studies (n = 5728) from 43 countries. All but 1 study used self-report instruments. The overall pooled crude prevalence of depression or depressive symptoms was 27.2% (37 933/122 356 individuals; 95% CI, 24.7% to 29.9%, I2 = 98.9%). Summary prevalence estimates ranged across assessment modalities from 9.3% to 55.9%. Depressive symptom prevalence remained relatively constant over the period studied (baseline survey year range of 1982-2015; slope, 0.2% increase per year [95% CI, -0.2% to 0.7%]). In the 9 longitudinal studies that assessed depressive symptoms before and during medical school (n = 2432), the median absolute increase in symptoms was 13.5% (range, 0.6% to 35.3%). Prevalence estimates did not significantly differ between studies of only preclinical students and studies of only clinical students (23.7% [95% CI, 19.5% to 28.5%] vs 22.4% [95% CI, 17.6% to 28.2%]; P = .72). The percentage of medical students screening positive for depression who sought psychiatric treatment was 15.7% (110/954 individuals; 95% CI, 10.2% to 23.4%, I2 = 70.1%). Suicidal ideation prevalence data were extracted from 24 cross-sectional studies (n = 21 002) from 15 countries. All but 1 study used self-report instruments. The overall pooled crude prevalence of suicidal ideation was 11.1% (2043/21 002 individuals; 95% CI, 9.0% to 13.7%, I2 = 95.8%). Summary prevalence estimates ranged across assessment modalities from 7.4% to 24.2%. Conclusions and Relevance In this systematic review, the summary estimate of the prevalence of depression or depressive symptoms among medical students was 27.2% and that of suicidal ideation was 11.1%. Further research is needed to identify strategies for preventing and treating these disorders in this population.","Rotenstein, Lisa S; Ramos, Marco A; Torre, Matthew; Segal, J Bradley; Peluso, Michael J; Guille, Constance; Sen, Srijan; Mata, Douglas A",JAMA,425,1

Transumbilical laparoendoscopic single-site adrenalectomy (LESS-A) is technically safe and feasible in patients with benign adrenal tumors. To improve patient counseling and informed consent, we evaluated patient-reported postoperative pain, body image, and cosmetic satisfaction after transumbilical LESS-A. METHODS We reviewed 24 patients who underwent transumbilical LESS-A and assessed their operative and esthetic outcomes and incisional pain. Incisional pain was evaluated using a 10-point visual analog scale, and the body image and cosmetic satisfaction were measured using a questionnaire that included a body image scale (range, 5-20 points) and a cosmetic scale (range, 3-24 points). RESULTS Pure LESS-A was performed on 10 patients using a multichannel port; an additional 5-mm trocar was used in two obese patients. Supplementary to the single-incision approach, one or two 3-mm ports were used in 12 patients. The mean operative time was 203 min; the mean blood loss was 41 mL. The mean pain visual analog scale scores on postoperative days 1, 3, and 7 were 3.5, 2.2 (P = 0.012), and 1.5 points (P = 0.018), respectively. The mean body image scale and cosmetic scale scores indicating wound satisfaction 1 month after the surgery were 20 and 22 points, respectively. Although one patient had liver injury during surgery, the postoperative course during the 3-month follow-up was uneventful. CONCLUSION Transumbilical LESS-A confers less postoperative pain and better cosmetic satisfaction than conventional laparoscopic adrenalectomy. Therefore, this procedure could potentially become a standard treatment option for benign adrenal tumors.","Nomura, Takeo; Takei, Kohei; Abe, Satoki; Fukuda, Yuko; Yamanaka, Naoyuki; Sejiyama, Shinya; Yamasaki, Mutsushi; Shibuya, Tadamasa; Ando, Tadasuke; Mori, Ken-Ichi; Sumino, Yasuhiro; Sato, Fuminori; Mimata, Hiromitsu",Asian journal of endoscopic surgery,425,23

OBJECTIVE To evaluate feasibility and patient safety of a hybrid monitoring strategy of point of care (POC) BG plus continuous glucose monitor (CGM) in the ICU. DESIGN Retrospective analysis. SETTING ICU of an academic medical center. PATIENTS Patients with COVID-19 on intravenous (IV) insulin. INTERVENTION After meeting initial validation criteria, CGM was used for IV insulin titration and POC BG was performed every 6 hours or as needed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Outcomes included frequency of POC BG, workflow, safety, and accuracy measures. RESULTS The study included 19 patients, 18 with CGM data, mean age 58 years, 89% on mechanical ventilation, 37% on vasopressors, and 42% on dialysis. The median time to CGM validation was 137 minutes (interquartile range [IQR] 114-206). During IV insulin, the median number of POC values was 7 (IQR 6-16) on day 1, and declined slightly thereafter ( 71% reduction compared to standard of 24 /day). The median number of CGM values used nonadjunctively to titrate IV insulin was 11.5 (IQR 0, 15) on day 1 and increased thereafter. Time in range 70-180mg/dl was 64+/-23% on day 1 and 72+/-16% on day 2-7 while time <70 mg/dl was 1.5 +/-4.1% on day 1 and <1% on days 2-7.

The factors relevant to aerosol characteristics include aerosol particle size, concentration, infectivity and virulence. To investigate these characteristics and their changes in different environmental conditions, a laboratory model is required. In this study, replication-deficient recombinant adenovirus (RDRADS) encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP) was used as a model virus. Model virus aerosols were generated using a TK-3 aerosol generator attached to a chamber which could simulate different environmental conditions. Virus aerosol specimens were collected with an FA-1 six-stage impact sampler. The relative genome copy number of viruses in the aerosol was determined by real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR. The number of virus-infected PK15 (pig kidney) cells was determined by counting cells with green fluorescence under a fluorescence microscope at 48 h post-inoculation. Fifteen experiments in different conditions were performed. We found that the viral DNA was present in stages 4-6 of the sampler, with the peak value at stage 5, corresponding to aerosols with a particle size of 0.65-3.3 mum. PK15 cells with green fluorescence showed the same size distribution range at temperatures >29 degrees C and above, where no green fluorescent cells were found, while the genome copy number assayed by real-time PCR remained unchanged. In the presence of high concentrations of particulate matter created by burning biomass, the peak value of virus genome copy number and green fluorescent cell counts shifted to stage 4 of the sampler, corresponding to aerosols with a particle size of 2.1-3.3 mum. The results provide evidence that viruses are present in the atmosphere as aerosols, which are much larger than their own particle size, and that the viruses in the aerosols are affected by atmospheric conditions. Our laboratory model was shown to be feasible for investigating the relationship between the characteristics of viruses and atmospheric conditions.","Li, Xiaoyan; Liu, Qicai; Bi, Xinhui; Sheng, Guoying; Fu, Jiamo; Ran, Pixin; Li, Bing",Journal of medical microbiology,425,19

Weight-loss-induced bone loss may be attenuated with exercise. Our aim was to compare changes in bone mineral density (BMD) in adults with overweight and obesity who undertook diet-induced weight loss alone, or in combination with exercise. METHODS We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in adults with overweight or obesity (aged ≥18 years; body mass index ≥25 kg/m2) that prescribed diet-induced weight loss alone, or in combination with supervised exercise and measured any bone structural parameters. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Random effects meta-analyses determined mean changes and net mean differences (95% confidence intervals (95%CIs)) in the percentage of areal BMD (aBMD) change between groups. RESULTS Nine RCTs were included. Diet-induced weight loss led to significant losses in femoral neck aBMD (mean change: -1.73% (95%CI: -2.39 to -1.07), p < 0.001) and total hip aBMD (-2.19% (95%CI: -3.84 to -0.54), p = 0.009). Femoral neck aBMD losses were significantly greater in the diet-induced weight loss group compared to the exercise plus diet-induced weight loss group (net difference: -0.88% (95%CI: -1.73 to -0.03)); however, there were no differences in aBMD changes at any other skeletal site: total hip (-1.96% (95%CI: -4.59 to 0.68)) and lumbar spine (-0.48% (95%CI: -1.81 to 0.86)). aBMD changes did not differ significantly according to exercise modality (resistance exercise, aerobic exercise, or a combination of the two) during diet-induced weight loss. CONCLUSION Diet-induced weight loss led to greater femoral neck bone loss compared to diet-induced weight loss plus exercise. Bone loss at the total hip and lumbar spine was not attenuated by exercise during diet-induced weight loss. The lack of consistent skeletal benefits may be due to the insufficient duration and/or training intensities of most exercise interventions. Additional RCTs with appropriate, targeted exercise interventions should be conducted.","Mesinovic, Jakub; Jansons, Paul; Zengin, Ayse; de Courten, Barbora; Rodriguez, Alexander J; Daly, Robin M; Ebeling, Peter R; Scott, David",Journal of sport and health science,425,24

Rapid screening tests to identify frailty within HIV outpatient settings are required to identify at-risk individuals. We undertook a service evaluation to assess three short frailty assessments in PWH. METHODS We assessed two objective [gait speed (GS), timed-up-and-go test (TUGT)] and one subjective [the self-reported health questionnaire (SRH)] frailty screening tools in PWH aged > 40 years attending a single HIV outpatient department. Factors associated with positive frailty screening tests (defined as GS < 0.8 m/s, TUGT ≥ 10 s and SRH score < 6) were assessed using logistic regression models. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS This was a service evaluation and was approved as a service evaluation by the Imperial College Healthcare NHS trust HIV clinical research committee (February 2020). All participants were given verbal information and were able to terminate the screening tests at any time. RESULTS Of 84 PWH approached, 80 individuals completed all screening tests (median age = 56 years, range: 40-80) with a positive frailty screening prevalence in 19%, 33% and 20% for GS, TUGT and SRH, respectively. All tests were considered acceptable to participants. Factors statistically significantly associated with frailty included age (GS and TUGT), detectable HIV RNA (TUGT), number of comorbidities (GS and TUGT), presence of polypharmacy (GS and TUGT) and total number of concomitant medication (GS and SRH). CONCLUSIONS Rates of positive screening tests for frailty are dependent on screening tool used, with all three tools being acceptable to participants. Objective measures of frailty screening (GS and TUGT) are more closely associated with clinical parameters than is a subjective measure of frailty screening (SRH).","Beanland, A; Alagaratnam, J; Goffe, C; Bailey, A; Dosekun, O; Petersen, C; Ayap, W; Garvey, L J; Walsh, J; Mackie, N E; Winston, A",HIV medicine,425,16

The case fatality rate seems higher in cardiovascular disease and hypertension. Other comorbidities do not seem to confer the same risk, therefore the understanding of the relationship between infection and cardiovascular system could be a crucial point for the fight against the virus. A great interest is currently directed towards the angiotensin 2 converting enzyme (ACE 2) which is the SARS-CoV-2 receptor and creates important connections between the virus replication pathway, the cardiovascular system and blood pressure. All cardiovascular conditions share an imbalance of the renin angiotensin system (RAAS) in which ACE 2 plays a central role.

METHODS Between February 2012 and February 2017, 98 patients underwent LESS-N in our institution, including 38 patients with benign renal disease and 60 patients with malignant renal disease. 39 were performed conventional LESS-N(C-LESS-N) and 59 were performed intraabdominal retractor-assisted LESS-N(IAR-LESS-N). Demographic data, and perioperative and postoperative data were collected and analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS All the procedures were completed successfully. In C-LESS-N group, four patients were added one 5-mm additional trocar and two patients were converted to open surgery. In IAR-LESS-N group, no patients required additional trocars or conversion to open surgery. The mean operative time was lower in IAR-LESS-N group than that in C-LESS-N group (94.2 min vs 127.4 min, P < 0.05). The mean renal vascular management time declined from 25.4 min in C-LESS-N group to 18.4 min in IAR-LESS-N group (P < 0.05). The mean estimated blood loss was 128.6 ml in C-LESS-N group and 102.3 ml in IAR-LESS-N group (P < 0.05). Two patients in C-LESS-N group required blood transfusion, while none of the patients in IAR-LESS-N group did. No severe postoperative complications occurred in both groups. Study limitations included retrospective study, short follow-up, and accumulated surgical experience and skills.

Our new CPT method consists of 15 prolonged slow expirations, then 5 provoked cough maneuvers. METHODS We randomized 20 infants (mean age 4.2 months) into 2 groups: 8 patients received 27 sessions of nebulization of hypertonic saline; 12 patients received 31 sessions of nebulization of hypertonic saline followed by our new CPT method. We used the Wang clinical severity scoring system (which assesses wheezing, respiratory rate, retractions, and general condition) and measured S(pO(2)) and heart rate before each CPT session (T0), immediately after the 30-min session (T30), and 120 min after the session (T150). RESULTS Within the groups: in the first group, Wang score was significantly lower at T150 than at T0: 4.6 vs 5.0 (P = .008). In the new-method-CPT group, Wang score was significantly lower at T30 (3.6 vs 4.3, P = .001) and at T150 (3.7 vs 4.3, P = .002). Wheezing score was significantly lower at T150 than at T0 (1.1 vs 1.2, P = .02) in the first group, and in the new-method-CPT group at T30 than at T0 (0.8 vs 1.3, P = .001) and at T150 than at T0 (0.9 vs 1.3, P = .001). Between the groups: at T30 the improvement was significantly better in the new-method-CPT group for overall Wang score (P = .02), retractions (P = .05), respiratory rate (P = .001), and heart rate (P < .001). At T150 the Wang score was not significantly different between the groups. At T30 (versus T0) the difference in percent gain between the groups was significant for Wang score (P = .004), wheezing (P = .001), and heart rate (P = .02). Over 5-hospital days, the daily baseline (T0) Wang score decreased significantly in the new-method-CPT group (P = .002), whereas it did not in the first group. There were no adverse events. Average hospital stay was not significantly different between the groups.

The purpose of this study was to provide an insight of the impact of the COVID-19 on ERAS protocols for knee arthroplasty patients in a tertiary hospital and potential strategy changes for postpandemic practice. We retrospectively reviewed all cases that underwent surgery utilizing ERAS protocols in the quarter prior to the pandemic (fourth quarter of 2019) and during the first quarter of 2020 when the pandemic started. A review of the literature on ERAS protocols for knee arthroplasty during the COVID-19 pandemic was also performed and discussed. A total of 199 knee arthroplasties were performed in fourth quarter of 2019 as compared with 76 in the first quarter of 2020 during the COVID-19 outbreak. Patients who underwent surgery in the first quarter of 2020 had shorter inpatient stays (3.8 vs. 4.5 days), larger percentage of discharges by postoperative day 5 (86.8 vs. 74.9%), and a larger proportion of patients discharged to their own homes (68 vs. 54%). The overall complication rate (1.3 vs. 3%) and readmission within 30 days (2.6 vs. 2%) was similar between both groups. ERAS protocols appear to reduce hospital lengths of stay for patients undergoing knee arthroplasty without increasing the risk of short-term complications and readmissions. The beneficial effects of ERAS appear to be amplified by and are synchronous with the requirements of operating in the era of a pandemic.","Ding, Benjamin Tze Keong; Ng, Jensen; Tan, Kelvin Guoping",The journal of knee surgery,425,31

Up to 40% of preterm births (PTBs) are associated with genital tract infections. The vaginal pH can reflect changes in the vaginal milieu and, if elevated, indicates an abnormal flora or infection. Objective The aim of the study was to investigate whether an increased antenatal vaginal pH >4.5 in pre-labour pregnant women is associated with an increased PTB rate <37 completed weeks gestation. Search strategy Key databases included SCOPUS, EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycInfo and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, complemented by hand search, up to January 2017. Selection criteria Primary research reporting vaginal pH assessment in pre-labour pregnant women and PTB rate. Data collection and analysis Data extraction and appraisal were carried out in a pre-defined standardised manner, applying the Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS) and Cochrane risk of bias tool. Analysis included calculation of risk difference (RD) and narrative synthesis. It was decided to abstain from pooling of the studies due to missing information in important moderators. Main results Of 986 identified records, 30 were included in the systematic review. The risk of bias was considered mostly high (40%) or moderate (37%). Fifteen studies permitted a calculation of RD. Of these, 14 (93%) indicated a positive association between increased antenatal vaginal pH and PTB (RD range: 0.02-0.75). Conclusion An increased antenatal vaginal pH >4.5 may be associated with a higher risk for PTB. It is recommended to conduct a randomised controlled trial (RCT) to investigate the effectiveness of antenatal pH screening to prevent PTB. Tweetable abstract Pregnant women with an increased vaginal pH >4.5 may be at higher risk to experience preterm birth.","Weckend, Marina J; Spineli, Loukia M; Grylka-Baeschlin, Susanne; Gross, Mechthild M",Journal of perinatal medicine,425,1

We hypothesized that such loci may affect weight loss outcomes following dietary or surgical weight loss interventions. A total of 1,001 white individuals with extreme obesity (BMI >35 kg/m(2)) who underwent a preoperative diet/behavioral weight loss intervention and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery were genotyped for single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in or near the fat mass and obesity-associated (FTO), insulin induced gene 2 (INSIG2), melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R), and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 1 (PCSK1) obesity genes. Association analysis was performed using recessive and additive models with pre- and postoperative weight loss data. An increasing number of obesity SNP alleles or homozygous SNP genotypes was associated with increased BMI (P < 0.0006) and excess body weight (P < 0.0004). No association between the amounts of weight lost from a short-term dietary intervention and any individual obesity SNP or cumulative number of obesity SNP alleles or homozygous SNP genotypes was observed. Linear mixed regression analysis revealed significant differences in postoperative weight loss trajectories across groups with low, intermediate, and high numbers of obesity SNP alleles or numbers of homozygous SNP genotypes (P < 0.0001). Initial BMI interacted with genotype to influence weight loss with initial BMI <50 kg/m(2), with evidence of a dosage effect, which was not present in individuals with initial BMI ≥50 kg/m(2). Differences in metabolic rate, binge eating behavior, and other clinical parameters were not associated with genotype. These data suggest that response to a surgical weight loss intervention is influenced by genetic susceptibility and BMI.","Still, Christopher D; Wood, G Craig; Chu, Xin; Erdman, Robert; Manney, Christina H; Benotti, Peter N; Petrick, Anthony T; Strodel, William E; Mirshahi, Uyenlinh L; Mirshahi, Tooraj; Carey, David J; Gerhard, Glenn S",Obesity,425,1

The aim of this study is to examine the feasibility of this screening tool in reducing the service burden and expediting patient journey. METHODS AND RESULTS All referrals made to a single tertiary referral sarcoma unit from January 2010 to December 2018 were extracted from a prospective database. Only 26.0% events discussed required review directly. 30.3% were discharged back to referrer. 16.5% required further investigations. 22.5% required a biopsy prior to review. There was a reduction in the rate of patients reviewed at the sarcoma clinic, and a higher discharge rate from the MDT in 2018 versus 2010 (p < 0.001). This gives a potential cost saving of 670,700 GBP over the 9 year period. CONCLUSION An MDT meeting which triages referrals is cost-effective at reducing unnecessary referrals.

Colon or jejunum is selected for patients in whom stomach cannot be used. Colon interposition is reported to have a high incidence of anastomotic leakage and mortality. For safer surgical treatment, the authors adopted supercharged pedicle jejunum reconstruction as the operation of choice in patients with esophageal cancer who had no stomach to use as an esophageal substitute. The aim of this study was to review our experience with this technique. METHODS From 2003 to 2009, esophagectomy and antethoracic pedicled jejunum reconstruction with the supercharge technique was performed in 27 patients with esophageal cancer at the Department of Gastroenterological Surgery (Surgery II), Nagoya University Hospital. Medical records of these 27 patients were retrospectively reviewed to determine demographic data, diagnosis, functional results, and perioperative course. RESULTS Median operating time, blood loss, hospital stay, and duration of enteral feeding were 636 min (range 454-856 min), 580 ml (range 208-1959 ml), 27 days (range 16-72 days), and 80 days (range 26-1740 days), respectively. There were no in-hospital deaths. Anastomotic leakage occurred in two patients and was successfully managed conservatively. In 2 of 27 patients, the pedicled jejunum was of insufficient length, and additional procedures were needed to complete the anastomosis. CONCLUSIONS Although antethoracic pedicled jejunum reconstruction with the supercharge technique is technically demanding, it is a reliable technique and contributes to successful reconstruction after esophagectomy for patients in whom stomach is not available for reconstruction.","Iwata, Naoki; Koike, Masahiko; Kamei, Yuzuru; Tanaka, Chie; Ohashi, Norifumi; Nakayama, Goro; Nomoto, Shuji; Fujii, Tsutomu; Sugimoto, Hiroyuki; Fujiwara, Michitaka; Kodera, Yasuhiro",World journal of surgery,425,1

To identify novel pathways for PrP down-regulation, we analyzed cells that had adapted to the negative selection pressure of stable overexpression of a disease-causing PrP mutant. A mutant cell line was isolated that selectively and quantitatively routes wild-type and various mutant PrPs for ER retrotranslocation and proteasomal degradation. Biochemical analyses of the mutant cells revealed that a defect in glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor synthesis leads to an unprocessed GPI-anchoring signal sequence that directs both ER retention and efficient retrotranslocation of PrP. An unprocessed GPI signal was sufficient to impart ER retention, but not retrotranslocation, to a heterologous protein, revealing an unexpected role for the mature domain in the metabolism of misprocessed GPI-anchored proteins. Our results provide new insights into the quality control pathways for unprocessed GPI-anchored proteins and identify transamidation of the GPI signal sequence as a step in PrP biosynthesis that is absolutely required for its surface expression. As each GPI signal sequence is unique, these results also identify signal recognition by the GPI-transamidase as a potential step for selective small molecule perturbation of PrP expression.","Ashok, Aarthi; Hegde, Ramanujan S",Molecular biology of the cell,425,1

Newly emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus2 (SARS-CoV-2), recognizes angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to gain entry into different cells. Interestingly, besides SARS-CoV2, four other human coronaviruses (HCoVs) use three different ectopeptidases (ACE2, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 and aminopeptidase N) as receptors independent of their common peptidase activity. This issue has led to the important question ""why do several HCoVs rely on peptidases as their receptors?"". In this article we discussed to answer this question. Mostly, it seems that the use of peptidases by HCoVs may be more related to their widespread presence on target cells and also viruses prefer to take advantage of molecules with relatively low affinity for their natural ligands through evolving a stronger binding affinity to the surface receptors for entry and endocytosis. Meanwhile evolutionary conservation of these receptors may allow HCoVs to switch between different host species. Finally the choice of peptidases by HCoVs may reflect the 'trial and error' nature of evolution. In conclusion substantial efforts are needed to get a strong picture of this fascinating question and poorly-explored area. Detailed understanding of the entry mechanisms offers opportunities for the development of refined strategies to stop viruses. This article is protected by copyright.

This work aims to assess the cost-effectiveness of the St Vincent's Screening TO Prevent Heart Failure (STOP-HF) intervention. METHODS AND RESULTS This is a substudy of 1054 participants with cardiovascular risk factors [median age 65.8 years, interquartile range (IQR) 57.8:72.4, with 4.3 years, IQR 3.4:5.2, follow-up]. Annual natriuretic peptide-based screening was performed, with collaborative cardiovascular care between specialist physicians and general practitioners provided to patients with BNP levels >50 pg/mL. Analysis of cost per case prevented and cost-effectiveness per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained was performed. The primary clinical endpoint of LV dysfunction (LVD) with or without HF was reduced in intervention patients [odds ratio (OR) 0.60; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.38-0.94; P = 0.026]. There were 157 deaths and/or emergency hospitalizations for major adverse cardiac events (MACE) in the control group vs. 102 in the intervention group (OR 0.68; 95% CI 0.49-0.93; P = 0.01). The cost per case of LVD/HF prevented was €9683 (sensitivity range -€843 to €20 210), whereas the cost per MACE prevented was €3471 (sensitivity range -€302 to €7245). Cardiovascular hospitalization savings offset increased outpatient and primary care costs. The cost per QALY gain was €1104 and the intervention has an 88% probability of being cost-effective at a willingness to pay threshold of €30 000. CONCLUSION Among patients with cardiovascular risk factors, natriuretic peptide-based screening and collaborative care reduced LVD, HF, and MACE, and has a high probability of being cost-effective.

In the present study, human embryonic stem cells are induced to differentiate into hepatocytes along hepatic lineages to mimic liver development in vitro. A liver progenitor specific gene, RALY RNA binding protein like (RALYL), is identified. RALYL expression is associated with poor prognosis, poor differentiation, and metastasis in clinical HCC patients. Functional studies reveal that RALYL could promote HCC tumorigenicity, self-renewal, chemoresistance, and metastasis. Moreover, molecular mechanism studies show that RALYL could upregulate TGF-β2 mRNA stability by decreasing N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification. TGF-β signaling and the subsequent PI3K/AKT and STAT3 pathways, upregulated by RALYL, contribute to the enhancement of HCC stemness. Collectively, RALYL is a liver progenitor specific gene and regulates HCC stemness by sustaining TGF-β2 mRNA stability. These findings may inspire precise therapeutic strategies for HCC.","Wang, Xia; Wang, Jin; Tsui, Yu-Man; Shi, Chaoran; Wang, Ying; Zhang, Xin; Yan, Qian; Chen, Miao; Jiang, Chen; Yuan, Yun-Fei; Wong, Chun-Ming; Liu, Ming; Feng, Zeng-Yu; Chen, Honglin; Ng, Irene Oi Lin; Jiang, Lingxi; Guan, Xin-Yuan",Nature communications,425,26

METHODS We retrospectively examined data in consecutive anterior circulation AIS patients undergoing thrombolysis. MR perfusion (time to maximum of tissue residue function, Tmax) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) images were transformed into standard space and the volumes of CST involvement by Tmax > 6 s (CST-Tmax) and ADC < 620 × 10-6 mm2/s (CST-ADC) lesions were calculated. Good outcome was defined as modified Rankin scale ≤ 2 at 3 months. Reperfusion was defined as a reduction in Tmax > 6 s lesion volume of ≥70% between baseline and 24 h. RESULTS 82 patients were included. Binary logistic regression revealed that both CST-Tmax and CST-ADC volume at baseline were significantly associated with poor outcome (p < 0.05). The 24-h CST-ADC volume was correlated with baseline CST-ADC volume in patients with reperfusion (r = 0.79, p < 0.001) and baseline CST-Tmax volume in patients without reperfusion (r = 0.67, p < 0.001). In patients with CST-Tmax volume > 0 mL and CST-ADC volume < 3 mL, the rate of good outcome was higher in patients with reperfusion than those without (70.4% vs 38.1%, p = 0.04).

We sought to determine whether pretreatment computed tomography perfusion parameters might help to identify patients at a higher risk of developing intracranial hemorrhage after intra-arterial stroke revascularization treatment. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed all patients at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and Michigan State University who underwent computed tomography perfusion imaging of the brain before intra-arterial thrombolysis between January 2006 and June 2007. Demographic information, angiographic variables, and types of endovascular interventions were recorded. The mean transit time and cerebral blood volumes were recorded for the ipsilateral and contralateral middle cerebral artery territories. A binary logistic regression model was constructed to determine the independent predictors of developing intracranial hemorrhage. RESULTS A total of 57 patients (33 from the University of Pittsburgh and 24 from Michigan State University) with a mean age of 66 +/- 13 years and mean National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale scores of 16 +/- 5 were studied. The overall recanalization (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction Trial scale 2 or 3 flow) was 72% for the cohort, and the overall rate of parenchymal hemorrhage was 5 of 57 (9%) patients. The overall hemorrhage rate was 19 of 57 (33%) patients. The only variable found to be predictive of the development of hemorrhage after intervention was reduced pretreatment cerebral blood volume (odds ratio, 0.49; 95% confidence interval, 0.35-0.91; P < 0.022). CONCLUSION A reduced pretreatment ipsilateral cerebral blood volume value before endovascular revascularization of an acute middle cerebral artery or internal carotid artery occlusion significantly increases the risk of an intracranial hemorrhage.","Bhatt, Archit; Vora, Nirav A; Thomas, Ajith J; Majid, Arshad; Kassab, Mounzer; Hammer, Maxim D; Uchino, Ken; Wechsler, Lawrence; Jovin, Tudor G; Gupta, Rishi",Neurosurgery,425,17

RESULTS Flow-diverter compaction resulted in a compaction coverage of 57%, 47%, and 22% over the orifice of the fusiform, large, and medium saccular aneurysm, respectively. Compaction coverage increased linearly with orifice area. In the fusiform aneurysm, the single compacted flow diverter accomplished more aneurysmal flow reduction than the other 2 strategies, as indicated by all 5 hemodynamic parameters. In the 2 saccular aneurysms, the overlapped flow diverters achieved the most flow reduction, followed by the single compacted and the noncompacted flow diverter. CONCLUSIONS Compacting a single flow diverter can outperform overlapping 2 flow diverters in aneurysmal flow reduction, provided that the compaction produces a mesh denser than 2 overlapped flow diverters and this denser mesh covers a sufficient portion of the aneurysm orifice area, for which we suggest a minimum of 50%. This strategy is most effective for aneurysms with large orifices, especially fusiform aneurysms.","Damiano, R J; Tutino, V M; Paliwal, N; Ma, D; Davies, J M; Siddiqui, A H; Meng, H",AJNR.

The sequence of Chinese white pear genome (cv. 'Dangshansuli') along with the seven other species of Rosaceae has already been reported. Although, in these fruit crops, there is still a lack of clarity regarding the LYP family genes and their evolutionary history. RESULTS In the existing study, eight Rosaceae species i.e., Pyrus communis, Prunus persica, Fragaria vesca, Pyrus bretschneideri, Prunus avium, Prunus mume, Rubus occidentalis, and Malus × domestica were evaluated. Here, we determined a total of 124 LYP genes from the underlined Rosaceae species. While eighteen of the genes were from Chinese white pear, named as PbrLYPs. According to the LYPs structural characteristics and their phylogenetic analysis, those genes were classified into eight groups (group LYK1, LYK2, LYK3, LYK4/5, LYM1/3, LYM2, NFP, and WAKL). Dispersed duplication and whole-genome duplication (WGD) were found to be the most contributing factors of LYP family expansion in the Rosaceae species. More than half of the duplicated PbrLYP gene pairs were dated back to the ancient WGD (~ 140 million years ago (MYA)), and PbrLYP genes have experienced long-term purifying selection. The transcriptomic results indicated that the PbrLYP genes expression was tissue-specific. Most PbrLYP genes showed differential expression in leaves under fungal pathogen infection with two of them located in the plasmalemma. CONCLUSION A comprehensive analysis identified 124 LYP genes in eight Rosaceae species. Our findings have provided insights into the functions and characteristics of the Rosaceae LYP genes and a guide for the identification of other candidate LYPs for further genetic improvements for pathogen-resistance in higher plants.","Chen, Qiming; Li, Qionghou; Qiao, Xin; Yin, Hao; Zhang, Shaoling",BMC genomics,425,23

Papillary neoplasms may be more amenable to radio frequency ablation than clear cell carcinoma because they are less vascular, which may limit heat energy loss. We report the long-term outcomes of patients treated with radio frequency ablation for small renal masses by renal cell carcinoma subtype. MATERIALS AND METHODS The records of patients undergoing radio frequency ablation for small renal masses (cT1a) at 2 institutions from March 2007 to July 2012 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were included in analysis if they had biopsy confirmed clear cell or papillary renal cell carcinoma histology. Patients had at least 1 contrast enhanced cross-sectional image following radio frequency ablation. Demographic data between tumor subtypes were compared using the paired t-test. Oncologic outcomes were determined by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and survivor curves were compared with the log rank test. RESULTS A total of 229 patients met study inclusion criteria. There were 181 clear cell tumors and 48 papillary tumors. Median followup was 33.2 months. There was no difference between tumor groups based on patient age, tumor size or grade, or months of followup. Five-year disease-free survival was 89.7% for clear cell tumors and 100% for papillary tumors (p = 0.041). There was no significant difference in overall survival (88.4% vs 89.6%, p = 0.764). CONCLUSIONS Radio frequency ablation outcomes seem to be determined in part by renal cell carcinoma subtype with clear cell renal tumors having less favorable outcomes. We hypothesize that this is due to differences in tumor vascularity. Our experience suggests that future tumor ablation studies should consider reporting outcomes based on tumor cell types.","Lay, Aaron H; Faddegon, Stephen; Olweny, Ephrem O; Morgan, Monica; Lorber, Gideon; Trimmer, Clayton; Leveillee, Raymond; Cadeddu, Jeffrey A; Gahan, Jeffrey C",The Journal of urology,425,20

METHODS This was a prospective single-center study including all patients treated with RFA from September 2014 to December 2015. The sample was divided according to the maximum GSV diameter measured on duplex ultrasound scan (A, <12 mm; B, ≥12 mm). Second-generation catheters (ClosureFast; Covidien, Mansfield, Mass) and tumescent anesthesia were used. Clinical stage (according to Clinical, Etiology, Anatomy, and Pathophysiology [CEAP] classification), quality of life (measured by the 14-item Chronic Venous Insufficiency Questionnaire), and pain on visual analog scale were recorded before the procedure and during follow-up. Technical success was defined as GSV occlusion on duplex ultrasound scan. Safety was defined as incidence and type of adverse events at 10 days, 1 month, 6 months, and 12 months. RESULTS There were 257 patients included, 183 (71%) with GSV diameter <12 mm and 74 (29%) with GSV diameter ≥12 mm. Mean GSV diameter was 8 ± 2 mm (4-11 mm) and 14 ± 2 mm (12-21 mm), respectively. Before the procedure, although a tendency toward greater clinical severity was observed in group B, no significant differences were found in the percentage of patients in C4 and C5 categories (A, 10%; B, 22%), median pain perception (A, 40; B, 39), or median quality of life value on the 14-item Chronic Venous Insufficiency Questionnaire scale (A, 27; B, 27). The rate of GSV occlusion at 1 month (n = 221) was 97% in group A and 100% in group B (P = .325); at 6 months (n = 158), it was 97% and 98%, respectively (P > .999); and at 12 months (n = 90), it was 99% and 96% (P = .481). There was a significant improvement in pain and quality of life in both groups, without differences between them. Finally, no differences between groups were found in terms of adverse events. Paresthesias were the most frequent event (A, 4%; B, 5%; P = NS), which disappeared during follow-up in half of the cases. Regarding major adverse events, there was only one case of deep venous thrombosis in group B. CONCLUSIONS RFA is safe and effective for the treatment of GSV ≥12 mm at midterm.","Cabrero Fernandez, Maday; Martinez Lopez, Isaac; Hernandez Mateo, Manuela Maria; Marques de Marino, Pablo; Cernuda Artero, Iñaki; Serrano Hernando, Francisco Javier",Journal of vascular surgery.

OBJECTIVE To analyze the results of multimodality treatment for a consecutive series of pediatric patients with ruptured and unruptured BAVMs at a single institution. METHODS Forty patients <18 years of age were retrospectively reviewed. Results were divided by hemorrhage status, ie, ruptured or unruptured, and the intended curative treatment modality, ie, surgical resection or stereotactic radiosurgery. RESULTS Twenty-seven patients (68%) presented with hemorrhage, and 13 patients (32%) presented without hemorrhage. Among ruptured patients, 19 (70%) underwent surgery and 8 (30%) underwent stereotactic radiosurgery. In surviving patients who presented with hemorrhage, 23 of 26 (88%) had a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 0 to 2 at the last follow-up, and 24 of 26 (92%) obtained radiographic cure. For unruptured BAVMs, all 6 patients with grade I to III BAVM obtained radiographic cure and had an mRS score of 0 to 1 at the last follow-up, whereas 1 of 5 patients (20%) with grade IV and V BAVM had BAVM obliteration and a mean mRS score of 1.8 at the last follow-up. In a total of 93.6 years of follow-up from date of presentation to last clinical follow-up, there was 1 hemorrhage (1.1%/y). Of 30 patients with radiographic obliteration, 2 patients had radiographic recurrence (7% incidence). CONCLUSION The majority of ruptured patients had an mRS score of 0 to 2 at the last follow-up and obtained radiographic cure. Unruptured patients with grade I to III BAVMs had superior outcomes compared with those with grade IV and V AVMs. Treatment of grade I to III BAVMs appears safe, and additional study is needed to determine optimal strategies for the management of unruptured grade IV and V BAVMs.","Nerva, John D; Kim, Louis J; Barber, Jason; Rockhill, Jason K; Hallam, Danial K; Ghodke, Basavaraj V; Sekhar, Laligam N",Neurosurgery,425,1

We report here that, unlike the JSRV envelope (Env) protein, the ENTV Env protein does not induce cell fusion at pHs of 5.0 and above but requires a much lower pH (4.0 to 4.5) for fusion to occur. The entry of ENTV Env pseudovirions was substantially inhibited by bafilomycin A1 (BafA1) but was surprisingly enhanced by lysosomotropic agents and lysosomal protease inhibitors following a 4- to 6-h treatment period; of note, prolonged treatment with BafA1 or ammonium chloride completely blocked ENTV entry. Unlike typical pH-dependent viruses, ENTV Env pseudovirions were virtually resistant to inactivation at a low pH (4.5 or 5.0). Using chimeras formed from ENTV and JSRV Env proteins, we demonstrated that the transmembrane (TM) subunit of ENTV Env is primarily responsible for its unusually low pH requirement for fusion but found that the surface (SU) subunit of ENTV Env also critically influences its relatively low and pH-dependent fusion activity. Furthermore, the poor infectivity of ENTV pseudovirions in human cells was significantly improved by either replacing the SU subunit of ENTV Env with that of JSRV Env or overexpressing the functional Hyal2 receptor in target cells, suggesting that ENTV SU-Hyal2 interaction is likely to be the limiting step for viral infectivity. Collectively, our data reveal that the fusogenicity of ENTV Env is intrinsically lower than that of JSRV Env and that ENTV requires a more acidic pH for fusion, which may occur in an intracellular compartment(s) distinct from that used by JSRV.","Côté, Marceline; Kucharski, Thomas J; Liu, Shan-Lu",Journal of virology,425,24

BACKGROUND Angioplasty and stenting are options for revascularization of symptomatic peripheral artery disease. While angioplasty alone is effective in short lesions, outcomes in longer lesions (i.e., mean 8.7 cm) show suboptimal patency rates of 33% at one year. METHODS Two hundred eighty-seven patients (mean age 68 years, 66% male) were treated with the EverFlex™ Self-Expanding Peripheral Stent System. Patients were followed through 3 years with yearly core lab adjudicated duplex ultrasonography for patency, radiographic assessment of stent fractures, and resting ankle brachial indices. RESULTS Overall freedom from loss of primary patency at 3 years was 60.0%. Patency was significantly higher for lesions ≤8 cm compared with lesions >8 cm (71.0 vs. 50.5%, P < 0.0001). There was no significant difference in patency between single-stent and multistent recipients (60.4 vs. 52.4%, P = 0.343). The three-year freedom from clinically driven target lesion revascularization was 70.0%. At 3 years, the overall stent fracture rate was 0.9%. CONCLUSIONS DURABILITY II is the first investigational device exemption trial to report 3-year duplex Doppler defined stent patency and CD-TLR outcomes in long SFA and proximal popliteal lesions and demonstrated acceptable stent patency and freedom from CD-TLR with a low fracture rate. These data suggest that use of a single long stent provides reasonable long-term outcomes when intervention is required for symptomatic SFA and proximal popliteal arterial disease.","Rocha-Singh, Krishna J; Bosiers, Marc; Schultz, Greg; Jaff, Michael R; Mehta, Manish; Matsumura, Jon S",Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,425,26

This study compares the bias and inaccuracy of a population-based vs a personalized TCI propofol titration using Bayesian adaptation. Haemodynamic and hypnotic stability, and the prediction probability of alternative PK models, was studied. Methods A double-blinded, prospective randomized controlled trial of 120 subjects undergoing cardiac surgery was conducted. Blood samples were obtained at 10, 35, 50, 65, 75 and 120 min and analysed using a point-of-care propofol blood analyser. Bayesian adaptation of the PK model was applied at 60 min in the intervention group. Median (Absolute) Performance Error (Md(A)PE) was used to evaluate the difference between bias and inaccuracy of the models. Haemodynamic (mean arterial pressure [MAP], heart rate) and hypnotic (bispectral index [BIS]) stability was studied. The predictive performance of four alternative propofol PK models was studied. Results MdPE and MdAPE did not differ between groups during the pre-adjustment period (control group: 6.3% and 16%; intervention group: 5.4% and 18%). MdPE differed in the post-adjustment period (12% vs. -0.3%), but MdAPE did not (18% vs. 15%). No difference in heart rate, MAP or BIS was found.

Early detection and treatment are critical to improving outcomes. Our primary objective was to develop artificial intelligence capable of predicting sepsis earlier using a minimal set of streaming physiological data in real-time. METHODS AND FINDINGS A total of 29,552 adult patients were admitted to the intensive care unit across five regional hospitals in Memphis, TN over 18 months from January 2017 to July 2018. From these, 5,958 patients were selected after filtering for continuous (minute-by-minute) physiological data availability. A total of 617 (10.4%) patients were identified as sepsis cases, using the Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock (Sepsis-3) criteria. Physiomarkers, a set of signal processing features, were derived from five physiological data streams including heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure (systolic, diastolic, and mean), captured every minute from the bedside monitors. A support vector machine (SVM) classifier was used for classification. The model accurately predicted sepsis up to a mean and 95% confidence interval of 17.4 ± 0.22 hours before sepsis onset, with an average test accuracy of 83.0% (average sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of 0.757, 0.902, and 0.781, respectively). CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrates that salient physiomarkers derived from continuous bedside monitoring are temporally and differentially expressed in septic patients. Using this information, minimalistic artificial intelligence models can be developed to predict sepsis earlier in critically ill patients.","Mohammed, Akram; Van Wyk, Franco; Chinthala, Lokesh K; Khojandi, Anahita; Davis, Robert L; Coopersmith, Craig M; Kamaleswaran, Rishikesan",Shock,425,1

This has implications for the spread of vectors and diseases they cause across diverse landscapes. Here, we assessed vector mosquito abundances in relation to large water bodies, from three malaria districts in a semi-arid environment. Furthermore, we explored thermal limits to activity of the dominant and most medically important malaria vector across malaria-endemic areas. Mosquitoes were trapped near permanent water bodies across different districts. Critical thermal limits (critical thermal-maxima and -minima) to activity of wild adults and 4th instar larvae Anopheles arabiensis (Diptera: Culicidae) were assessed. Our results showed that Anopheles spp. dominate mosquito communities across all three districts, but that their numbers were far greater in Okavango than in other regions. At the Okavango sites, the numbers of Anopheles spp. decreased with distance from main water source. Anopheles spp. sampled in this region comprised Anopheles gambiae (Giles,1902) and Anopheles funestus (Giles, 1900) species complexes, with the former dominating in numbers. Thermal activity assays showed An. arabiensis females had wider thermal tolerance windows than males while larval thermal activity limits differed significantly across space. These results confirm that the Okavango district should be prioritized for vector control measures. Moreover, intervention strategies should consider recommendations for proximity effects to large water bodies, given the differential risk associated with distance from water.

Objective: Our meta-analysis aims to compare the clinical characteristics between COVID-19 survivors and nonsurvivors requiring ECMO support. Methods: A systematic search of Pubmed, Cochrane, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science databases was performed between December first, 2019, to June first, 2021. Studies with comparative data of COVID-19 ECMO patients were selected, in which clinical characteristics and complications were assessed. Results: Sixteen cohort studies involving 706 COVID-19 patients requiring ECMO support with pooled mortality rate of 40% were included. Younger age (mean 51 years vs 55 years; P < .001), fewer comorbidities (23% vs 31%; odds ratio [OR] 0.55; P = .02), and less renal replacement therapy (RRT) (21% vs 39%; OR 0.41; P = .007) and vasopressor (76% vs 92%; OR 0.35; P = .008) requirement were demonstrated in COVID-19 survivors requiring ECMO support than nonsurvivors. Survivors also had higher pre-ECMO pH (mean 7.33 vs 7.26; P < .001) than nonsurvivors. No difference was observed in gender, body mass index, duration of mechanical ventilation (MV) before ECMO support initiation, total ECMO support duration, and pre-ECMO parameters of PaO2/FiO2 ratio, tidal volume (mL/kg), positive end-expiratory pressure, and plateau pressure. The rate of bleeding complications was lower in survivors (32% vs 59%; OR 0.36; P = .001) than nonsurvivors, but no difference was observed in thromboembolism and secondary infections. Conclusions: We found advanced age, multiple comorbidities, lower pre-ECMO pH, greater RRT, and vasopressor requirements, and bleeding are predictors of death in COVID-19 patients requiring ECMO support. The duration of MV before ECMO support initiation and total ECMO support duration was similar among survivors and nonsurvivors. Our study results have important clinical implications when considering ECMO support in critically ill COVID-19 patients.","Chong, Woon Hean; Saha, Biplab K; Medarov, Boris I",Journal of intensive care medicine,425,33

The extent of acinar insult, intensity, and type of immune response determines the severity of the disease. Smoking, alcohol and autoimmune pancreatitis are some of the predominant risk factors that increase the risk of pancreatitis by differentially influencing the adaptive immune system. The overall decrease in peripheral lymphocyte (T-, B- and (natural killer T-) NKT-cell) count and increased infiltration into the damaged pancreatic tissue highlight the contribution of adaptive immunity in the disease pathology. Smoking and alcohol modulate the responsiveness and apoptosis of T- and B-cells during pancreatic insult. Acute pancreatitis worsens with smoking and alcohol, leading to the development of systemic inflammatory response syndrome and compensatory anti-inflammatory response syndrome, suggesting the critical role of adaptive immunity in fatal outcomes such as multiple organ dysfunction. The presence of CD4+ and CD8+ T-lymphocytes and perforin-expressing cells in the fibrotic tissue in chronic pancreatitis modulate the severity of the disease. Due to their important role in altering the severity of the disease, attempts to target adaptive immune mediators will be critical for the development of novel therapeutic interventions.","Bhatia, Rakesh; Thompson, Christopher; Ganguly, Koelina; Singh, Shailender; Batra, Surinder K; Kumar, Sushil",Cells,425,17

The purpose of this study was to investigate early clinical and CT manifestations of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pneumonia. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia confirmed by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleic acid test (reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction) were enrolled in this retrospective study. The clinical manifestations, laboratory results, and CT findings were evaluated. RESULTS. One hundred eight patients (38 men, 70 women; age range, 21-90 years) were included in the study. The clinical manifestations were fever in 94 of 108 (87%) patients, dry cough in 65 (60%), and fatigue in 42 (39%). The laboratory results were normal WBC count in 97 (90%) patients and normal or reduced lymphocyte count in 65 (60%). High-sensitivity C-reactive protein level was elevated in 107 (99%) patients. The distribution of involved lobes was one lobe in 38 (35%) patients, two or three lobes in 24 (22%), and four or five lobes in 46 (43%). The major involvement was peripheral (97 patients [90%]), and the common lesion shape was patchy (93 patients [86%]). Sixty-five (60%) patients had ground-glass opacity (GGO), and 44 (41%) had GGO with consolidation. The size of lesions varied from smaller than 1 cm (10 patients [9%]) to larger than 3 cm (56 patients [52%]). Vascular thickening (86 patients [80%]), crazy paving pattern (43 patients [40%]), air bronchogram sign (52 patients [48%]), and halo sign (69 [64%]) were also observed in this study. CONCLUSION. The early clinical and laboratory findings of COVID-19 pneumonia are low to midgrade fever, dry cough, and fatigue with normal WBC count, reduced lymphocyte count, and elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level. The early CT findings are patchy GGO with or without consolidation involving multiple lobes, mainly in the peripheral zone, accompanied by halo sign, vascular thickening, crazy paving pattern, or air bronchogram sign.","Han, Rui; Huang, Lu; Jiang, Hong; Dong, Jin; Peng, Hongfen; Zhang, Dongyou",AJR.

Further characterization was made with radiography, CT, and bone scan, which were followed by ultrasound-guided biopsy. Although histopathologic features were suggestive of chondromyxoid fibroma, the diagnosis remained somewhat uncertain initially due to the very unusual location involving the diaphysis of the humerus. Surgical resection was performed, and subsequent histopathologic analysis confirmed the diagnosis of chondromyxoid fibroma.

We interviewed 66 science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) undergraduates with disabilities at seven large-enrollment institutions during Spring 2020. We probed to what extent students were able to access their existing accommodations, to what extent the online environment required novel accommodations, and what factors prevented students from being properly accommodated in STEM courses. Using inductive coding, we identified that students were unable to access previously established accommodations, such as reduced-distraction testing and note-takers. We also found that the online learning environment presented novel challenges for students with disabilities that may have been lessened with the implementation of accommodations. Finally, we found that instructors making decisions about what accommodations were appropriate for students and disability resource centers neglecting to contact students after the transition to online instruction prevented students from receiving the accommodations that they required in STEM courses during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Atrial fibrillation often goes undetected with traditional electrocardiogram monitoring techniques. We evaluated whether atrial fibrillation detection using continuous long-term monitoring with an insertable cardiac monitor is cost-effective for preventing recurrent stroke in patients with cryptogenic stroke, in comparison to the standard of care. METHODS A lifetime Markov model was developed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of insertable cardiac monitors from a UK National Health Service perspective using data from the randomized CRYSTAL-AF trial and other published literature. We also conducted scenario analyses (CHADS2 score) and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. All costs and benefits were discounted at 3.5%. RESULTS Monitoring cryptogenic stroke patients with an insertable cardiac monitor was associated with fewer recurrent strokes and increased quality-adjusted life years compared to the standard of care (7.37 vs 7.22). Stroke-related costs were reduced in insertable cardiac monitor patients, but overall costs remained higher than the standard of care (£19,631 vs £17,045). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was £17,175 per quality-adjusted life years gained, compared to standard of care in the base-case scenario, which is below established quality-adjusted life years willingness-to-pay thresholds. When warfarin replaced non-vitamin-K oral anticoagulants as the main anticoagulation therapy, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was £13,296 per quality-adjusted life years gained. CONCLUSION Insertable cardiac monitors are a cost-effective diagnostic tool for the prevention of recurrent stroke in patients with cryptogenic stroke. The cost-effectiveness results have relevance for the UK and across value-based healthcare systems that assess costs relative to outcomes.","Diamantopoulos, Alex; Sawyer, Laura M; Lip, Gregory Y H; Witte, Klaus K; Reynolds, Matthew R; Fauchier, Laurent; Thijs, Vincent; Brown, Ben; Quiroz Angulo, Maria E; Diener, Hans-Christoph",International journal of stroke : official journal of the International Stroke Society,425,30

Extensive research demonstrated that the Wnt signaling is one of the major affected pathways in HCC. This study aimed to find miRNA targeting β-catenin gene by bioinformatic approaches and confirm this correlation to propose new therapeutic targets for HCC. Prediction of miRNAs targeting 3'-Untranslated Regions (UTR) of β-catenin mRNA, were done using different types of credible bioinformatic databases. The luciferase assay was also recruited for further confirmation of the bioinformatic predictions. In the first step, the expression of β-catenin was assessed in the HepG2 cell line by real-time PCR technique. Next, transduction of HepG2 cells were done by lentiviral vectors containing the desired miRNA. Then, the expression level of miRNA and the β-catenin gene were evaluated. Based on the results obtained from different bioinformatic databases, miR-214 was selected as the potential miRNA with the highest probability in targeting β-catenin. Furthermore, Luciferase assay results confirmed the accuracy of our bioinformatic prediction. In line with our hypothesis, after the overexpression of miR-214 in HepG2 cells, β-catenin gene expression was reduced significantly. Gathered results indicate the miRNAs role in the down-regulation of their target genes. Hence, the results propose that miR-214 can prevent HCC development by suppressing β-catenin and may supply a newfound approach towards HCC therapy in humans.","Karimkhanloo, Hamzeh; Mohammadi-Yeganeh, Samira; Hadavi, Razie; Koochaki, Ameneh; Paryan, Mahdi",Molecular biology reports,425,1

This requirement renders them impractical for applications in which large numbers of electronic states are occupied. The authors recently introduced the collapse to a block (TAB) decoherence correction [M. P. Esch and B. G. Levine, J. Chem. Phys. 152, 234105 (2020)], which incorporates a state-pairwise definition of decoherence time to accurately describe dynamics on more than two electronic states. In this work, TAB is extended by introduction of a scheme for efficiently computing a small number of approximate eigenstates of the electronic Hamiltonian, eliminating the need for explicit knowledge of a large number of potential energy surfaces. This adaptation of TAB for dense manifolds of states (TAB-DMS) is systematically improvable by increasing the number of computed approximate eigenstates. Application to a series of one-dimensional model problems demonstrates that TAB-DMS can be accurate when even a very modest number of approximate eigenstates are computed (four in all models tested here). Comparison of TAB simulations to exact quantum dynamical simulations indicates that TAB is quite accurate so long as the decoherence correction is carefully parameterized.","Esch, Michael P; Levine, Benjamin G",The Journal of chemical physics,425,17

Broadly neutralizing antiviral agents bind in the same order when they neutralize enveloped viruses regardless of the location of epitopes to the host receptor binding site. Herein, we investigated the binding of cyanovirin-N (CV-N) to surface-expressed glycoproteins such as those of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) gp120, hemagglutinin (HA), and Ebola (GP)1,2 and compared their binding affinities with the binding response to the trimer-folded gp140 using surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Binding-site knockout variants of an engineered dimeric CV-N molecule (CVN2) revealed a binding affinity that correlated with the number of (high-) affinity binding sites. Binding curves were specific for the interaction with N-linked glycans upon binding with two low-affinity carbohydrate binding sites. This biologically active assembly of a domain-swapped CVN2, or monomeric CV-N, bound to HA with a maximum KD of 2.7 nM. All three envelope spike proteins were recognized at a nanomolar KD, whereas binding to HIV neutralizing 2G12 by targeting HA and Ebola GP1,2 was measured in the µM range and specific for the bivalent binding scheme in SPR. In conclusion, invariant structural protein patterns provide a substrate for affinity maturation in the membrane-anchored HA regions, as well as the glycan shield on the membrane-distal HA top part. They can also induce high-affinity binding in antiviral CV-N to HA at two sites, and CVN2 binding is achieved at low-affinity binding sites.","Maier, Irene; Schiestl, Robert H; Kontaxis, Georg",Molecules,425,1

Here, we discuss the organizing principles that govern cellular self-defense and how intracellular compartmentalization has shaped its activities to provide effective protection against a wide variety of microbial pathogens.","Randow, Felix; MacMicking, John D; James, Leo C",Science,425,16

The present review tries to bring out the correlation between the physiology of sneeze and cough taking into consideration the various receptors that initiate the two reflexes then correlating it with the formation of expelled droplets and the significance of various aspect of droplets that lead to the spread of infection. MATERIAL AND METHODS For the compilation of the present review we searched the terms ""Physiology of cough"", ""Physiology of sneeze"", ""droplets"", ""aerosols"" and ""Aerosols in COVID 19"". The above-mentioned terms were extensively searched on pubmed, google scholar and google search engine and after reviewing the various available material the most significant research has been taken into consideration for this review. CONCLUSION Through this review we conclude that there are various factors that are responsible for the initiation of sneeze and cough but in case of infection it is mainly the inflammatory reaction that directly stimulates the receptors to produce the reflex outburst of air. As the flow of air during expiration is turbulent it causes damage to the Epithelial Lining Fluid present in the respiratory conduit and also gets admixed with the saliva in the oropharynx and oral cavity and mucus in the nose to form droplets of various sizes. Large droplets Settle close and are responsible for Droplet and Fomite transmission but the smaller droplets remain suspended in air and travel farther distances to cause Airborne transmission. The spread of droplet cloud in sneezing may range to 6m or more as compared to cough hence the concept of 1m to 2m of social distancing does not hold good if the patient is sneezing.","Singh, Namit Kant; Kumar, Naina; Singh, Amit Kant",Infectious disorders drug targets,425,1

METHODS The EndoCAMeleon endoscope was assessed by experienced surgeons and assistants during a variety of advanced gynecologic laparoscopic procedures. After each procedure, both the surgeon and the assistant each completed questionnaires designed to assess the endoscope's ease of handling and optical performance. RESULTS The endoscope was assessed during 21 advanced procedures. Questionnaire responses confirmed surgeon and assistant satisfaction with the mechanical handling and vision provided by the endoscope. In particular, the ability to vary the viewing angles enabled the surgeon to visualize the surgical site without moving the endoscope shaft. CONCLUSIONS The new endoscope performed well in the hands of experienced surgeons and assistants undertaking advanced procedures. The variable-view rigid endoscope allows the use of visual ports during primary port entry and enhances vision. Further study is required to evaluate its performance in routine practice.","Eskef, K; Oehmke, F; Tchartchian, G; Muenstedt, K; Tinneberg, H-R; Hackethal, A",Surgical endoscopy,425,12

An illustrative application is presented. METHOD Stratum-specific psychological-distress rates for area SED quintiles are applied to local government areas, catchment areas and local health networks (LHNs). A case study applies the model to Victoria, including examining recommendations in the Royal Commission into Victoria's Mental Health Services (RCVMHS) 2019 interim report for increases to bed stock in two LHNs. RESULTS Need-adjusted demand estimates considered as a ratio of raw population proportions for catchments range between 0.6 to 1.4 in Victoria. Applying the formula to the Royal Commission recommendations suggests the proposed distribution of beds is a reasonable correction for these two LHNs and indicates next expansion priorities for more equitable distribution to other LHNs. CONCLUSIONS The spreadsheet, adaptable for other states and territories, could complement National Mental Health Services Planning Framework outputs and assist in evaluation, for instance, determining potential supply shortages in the tele-mental-health response to COVID-19. We outline research directions including consideration of the moral bases of value judgements and identification of other variables including their use in parameterisation and calibration.","Meadows, Graham; Shawyer, Frances; Dawadi, Shrinkhala; Inder, Brett; Enticott, Joanne",Australasian psychiatry : bulletin of Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists,425,17

STUDY DESIGN Preterm infants, divided into extremely preterm (gestational age 24-28 weeks; n = 23) and very preterm (gestational age 29-34 weeks; n = 33) groups, were studied weekly until discharge in prone and supine positions during active and quiet sleep. Cerebral tissue oxygenation index (TOI) and arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) were recorded. Cerebral fractional tissue extraction (CFOE) was calculated as CFOE = (SaO2 - TOI)/SaO2. RESULTS In extremely preterm infants, CFOE increased modestly in the prone position in both sleep states at age 1 week, in no change in TOI despite higher SaO2. In contrast, the very preterm infants did not have position-related differences in CFOE until the fifth week of life. In the very preterm infants, TOI decreased and CFOE increased with active sleep compared with quiet sleep and with increasing postnatal age. CONCLUSION At 1 week of age, prone sleeping increased CFOE in extremely preterm infants, suggesting reduced cerebral blood flow. Our findings reveal important physiological insights in clinically stable preterm infants. Further studies are needed to verify our findings in unstable preterm infants regarding the potential risk of cerebral injury in the prone sleeping position in early postnatal life.","Shepherd, Kelsee L; Yiallourou, Stephanie R; Odoi, Alexsandria; Brew, Nadine; Yeomans, Emma; Willis, Stacey; Horne, Rosemary S C; Wong, Flora Y",The Journal of pediatrics,425,12

We aimed to describe trends and variation in length of stay (LOS) for hospitalized febrile infants across children's hospitals. METHODS We conducted a multicenter retrospective cohort study of febrile infants aged ≤60 days hospitalized from 2016 to 2019 at 39 hospitals in the Pediatric Health Information System database. We excluded infants with complex chronic conditions, bacterial infections, lower respiratory tract viral infections, and those who required ICU admission. The primary outcomes were trends in LOS overall and for individual hospitals, adjusted for patient demographics and clinical characteristics. We also evaluated the hospital-level association between LOS and 30-day readmissions. RESULTS We identified 11 868 eligible febrile infant encounters. The adjusted mean LOS for the study cohort decreased from 44.0 hours in 2016 to 41.9 hours in 2019 (P < .001). There was substantial variation in adjusted mean LOS across children's hospitals, range 33.5-77.9 hours in 2016 and 30.4-100.0 hours in 2019. The change from 2016 to 2019 in adjusted mean LOS across individual hospitals also varied widely (-23.9 to +26.7 hours; median change -1.8 hours, interquartile range: -5.4 to 0.3). There was no association between hospital-level LOS and readmission rates (P = .70). CONCLUSIONS The LOS for hospitalized febrile infants decreased marginally between 2016 and 2019, although overall LOS and change in LOS varied substantially across children's hospitals. Continued quality improvement efforts are needed to reduce LOS for hospitalized febrile infants.","Stephens, John R; Hall, Matt; Cotter, Jillian M; Molloy, Matthew J; Tchou, Michael J; Markham, Jessica L; Shah, Samir S; Steiner, Michael J; Aronson, Paul L",Hospital pediatrics,425,31

METHODS Patients' self-reports of current gout flares were assessed with the question, 'Are you having a gout flare today?' which was then compared with a concurrent, blinded, physician's assessment. Based on agreement or disagreement with physicians on the presence of a gout flare, flares were divided into concordant and discordant groups, respectively. Within the discordant group, two subgroups-patient-reported flare but the physician disagreed and physician-reported flare but the patient disagreed-were identified. The factors associated with discordance were analysed with multivariable logistic regression analysis. RESULTS Of 268 gout flares, 81 (30.2%) flares were discordant, with either patient or physician disagreeing on the presence of a flare. Of the discordant flares, in 57 (70.4%) the patient reported a flare but the physician disagreed. In multivariable logistic regression analysis adjusted for demographics, disagreement among patients and physicians on the presence of a gout flare was associated with lower pain scores at rest [odds ratio (OR) for each point increase on 0-10 point pain scale 0.81 (95% Wald CI 0.73, 0.90), P < 0.0001] and less presence of joint swelling [OR 0.24 (95% CI 0.10, 0.61), P = 0.003] or joint warmth [OR 0.39 (95% CI 0.20, 0.75), P = 0.005]. CONCLUSION Although patients and physicians generally agree about the presence of gout flare, discordance may occur in the setting of low pain scores and in the absence of swollen or warm joints.","Jagpal, Aprajita; Rahn, Elizabeth J; Mudano, Amy S; Dalbeth, Nicola; Taylor, William; Saag, Kenneth G; Singh, Jasvinder A; Cavagna, Lorenzo; Uhlig, Till; Perez-Ruiz, Fernando; McCarthy, Geraldine; Gerritsen, Martijn; Stamp, Lisa; Vazquez Mellado, Janitzia; Lin, Chingtsai; Vargas-Santos, Ana Beatriz; Louthrenoo, Worawit; Neogi, Tuhina; Chen, Yi-Hsing; Castelar-Pinheiro, Geraldo da Rocha; Gaffo, Angelo",Rheumatology,425,1

Higher smoking rates contribute to greater tobacco-related disease and morbidity in rural and remote areas. Physical and social isolation, greater exposure to pro-tobacco marketing, pro-tobacco social norms, and lower socioeconomic and educational levels are contributing to these higher smoking rates and lower quit rates. Smoking cessation interventions for people in rural and remote areas have been conducted, however little is known about their effectiveness or their mechanisms of action as well as the quality of such research. Behaviour change techniques (BCTs) are mechanisms of action derived from behaviour change theory, such as goal setting and reward. Improved understanding of the contribution of BCTs for smoking cessation in the rural and remote population will support future intervention development. We aim to review the literature on smoking cessation interventions for people living in rural and remote areas to inform evidence about intervention effectiveness and mechanisms of action. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will conduct a systematic review using seven scientific databases (EMBASE, MedLine, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Cochrane, Informit Health and Scopus). We will include peer-reviewed journal articles published in English that examine a smoking cessation intervention delivered to people living in rural and remote areas in the USA, Canada and Australia. We will examine outcome data relating to intervention effectiveness (eg, point prevalence abstinence or continuous abstinence), as well as the BCTs used in included interventions and their relationship with intervention outcomes. We will also assess the feasibility, acceptability and quality of research interventions of included articles, and provide graded recommendations based on the review outcomes. Data will be synthesised using narrative approaches and interpreted using content analysis. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Ethics was not required for this systematic review. The results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publication and at conferences by presentations.

Glatiramer acetate (GA), a drug for the treatment for multiple sclerosis (MS), has been shown to induce immunomodulation and neuroprotection in the inflamed CNS in MS and in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Here we investigated whether GA can affect myelinogenesis and oligodendrogenesis in the developing nervous system under nonpathological conditions. Towards this end we studied myelination in mice injected daily by GA, at postnatal Days 7-21. Immunohistological and ultrastructural analyses revealed significant elevation in the number of myelinated axons as well as in the thickness of the myelin encircling them and their resulting g-ratios, in spinal cords of GA-injected mice compared with their PBS-injected littermates, at postnatal Day 14. Elevation in myelinated axons was detected also in the peripheral ventral roots of the motor nerves. GA induced also an increase in axonal diameter, implying an effect on the overall development of the nervous system. A prominent elevation in the amount of progenitor oligodendrocytes and their BrdU incorporation, as well as in mature oligodendrocytes indicated that the effect of GA is linked to increased proliferation and differentiation along the oligodendroglial maturation cascade. In addition, elevation in insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was found in the white matter of the GA-injected mice. Furthermore, a functional advantage in rotating rod test was exhibited by GA-injected mice over their littermates at postnatal Day 21. These cumulative findings corroborate the beneficial effect of GA on oligodendrogenesis and myelination.","From, Renana; Eilam, Raya; Bar-Lev, Dekel D; Levin-Zaidman, Smadar; Tsoory, Michael; LoPresti, Patrizia; Sela, Michael; Arnon, Ruth; Aharoni, Rina",Glia,425,29

The proposed circuitry provides operation in the full voltage range with automatic setting and holding the operating point, as well as the necessary slope of the conversion coefficient (up to 2300 mV/°C), which makes it possible to register fast temperature oscillations from the surface of the human body and other biological objects. Simulation results in the Microcap 12 software and laboratory tests have confirmed all declared design specifications: temperature resolution of 0.01 °C, transducer thermal time constant of 0.05 s. An original thermostat and an experimental setup for the simultaneous registration of the electrocardiogram, pulse wave signals from the Biopac polygraph MP36 and a signal of temperature oscillations from the prototype thermometer have been designed for further investigations. The preliminary test results indicates that using the designed measuring instrument gives a possibility to provide an in-depth study of the relationship between micro- and macro-blood circulations manifested in skin temperature fluctuations.","Suvorov, Nikolai B; Belov, Alexander V; Kuliabin, Konstantin G; Anisimov, Aleksei A; Sergeev, Timofei V; Markelov, Oleg A",Sensors,425,24

The various constructs of prosthetic mesh may alter the ability of bacteria to attach and form a biofilm. Few data exist evaluating biofilm formation. Using the Maestro in-Vivo Imaging System (CRi, Inc., Woburn, MA) to detect green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing Staphylococcus aureus, we studied the ability of synthetic mesh to withstand bacterial biofilm formation in an in vitro model. METHODS We included four meshes: Polypropylene (PP), polypropylene/expanded PTFE (PX), compressed PTFE (cPTFE), and polyester/polyethylene glycol and collagen hydrogel (PE). Five samples of each mesh were exposed to GFP-expressing S. aureus for 18 h at 37°C. Next, green fluorescence was measured using the Maestro Imaging System, with the results expressed in relative fluorescence units (RFU), subtracting the fluorescence of uninfected mesh (control). Each mesh subsequently underwent sonication and quantitative culture of the released bacteria, with the results expressed in colony-forming units (CFU). Analysis of variance was performed to compare the mean values for the different meshes. RESULTS There was a statistically significant difference in bacterial fluorescence for the four meshes: PE (49.9 ± 25.5 [standard deviation] RFU), PX (30.8 ± 9.4 RFU), cPTFE (10.1 ± 4.0 RFU), and PP (5.8 ± 7.5 RFU)(p = 0.001). Bacterial counts also were significantly different: PE (2.2 × 10(8) CFU), PX (8.6 × 10(7) CFU), cPTFE (3.7 × 10(7) CFU), and PP (9.1 × 10(7) CFU)(p < 0.001). CONCLUSION Using novel imaging technology, this study documented significantly different amounts of S. aureus biofilm formation and proliferation on different mesh constructs, with good agreement between imaging and culture results. A multifilament woven mesh (PE) had the highest degree of biofilm formation.

METHODS We reviewed neurologic symptoms in 71 deaths due to COVID-19 at the first US hospital with reported cases, of which 66 (93%) had medical comorbidities, 47 (66%) came from assisted living facilities or nursing homes and 35 (49%) had baseline dementia. RESULTS Sixty-one patients (86%) demonstrated neurologic symptoms at hospital admission. Altered mental status was seen in 47 patients (66%) and represented the most common neurologic symptom. Seven patients (10%) were comatose at hospital admission and 5 (7%) presented with altered mental status without respiratory symptoms. Three patients had seizures and two had strokes. Hypertension (61%), cardiovascular disease (59%), and dementia (49%) were the most common comorbidities associated with death due to COVID-19 in our sample. CONCLUSIONS Neurologic symptoms, particularly altered mental status, are very common in COVID-19 patients with high risk of mortality.

While inferior to sentinel surveillance, TPR has the benefit of being easily calculated using readily available data; however, interpreting TPR and its trends can be complex because both the numerator and the denominator are constantly changing. We describe a three-step process where the ratio of relative increase in cases to relative increase in tests is accounted for in an adjusted TPR. This adjusted value more appropriately reflects the case number and factors out the effect of changes in the number of tests done. Unadjusted and adjusted TPRs are then assessed step-wise with reference to the epidemic curve and the cumulative numbers of cases and tests. Use of this three-step analysis and its potential use in guiding public health interventions are demonstrated for selected countries and subnational areas of the World Health Organization South-East Asia Region, together with the Republic of Korea as a reference. To date, application of the three-step analysis to data from countries of the region has signalled potential inadequacies of testing strategies. Further work is needed on approaches to support countries where testing capacity is likely to remain constrained. One example would be enumeration of the average number of tests needed to detect one COVID-19 case, which could be stratified by factors such as location and population. Such data would allow evidence-informed strategies that best balance the highest detection rate with the prevailing testing capacity.","Vong, Sirenda; Kakkar, Manish",WHO South-East Asia journal of public health,425,7

Wild aquatic birds are believed to be the primary reservoir of all influenza viruses; however, the spillover of H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) and the recent swine-origin pandemic H1N1 viruses have sparked increased interest in identifying and understanding which and how many species can be infected. Moreover, novel influenza virus sequences were recently isolated from New World bats. Crocodilians have a slow rate of molecular evolution and are the sister group to birds; thus they are a logical reptilian group to explore susceptibility to influenza virus infection and they provide a link between birds and mammals. A primary American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) cell line, and embryos, were infected with four, low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) strains to assess susceptibility to infection. Embryonated alligator eggs supported virus replication, as evidenced by the influenza virus M gene and infectious virus detected in allantoic fluid and by virus antigen staining in embryo tissues. Primary alligator cells were also inoculated with the LPAI viruses and showed susceptibility based upon antigen staining; however, the requirement for trypsin to support replication in cell culture limited replication. To assess influenza virus replication in culture, primary alligator cells were inoculated with H1N1 human influenza or H5N1 HPAI viruses that replicate independent of trypsin. Both viruses replicated efficiently in culture, even at the 30 C temperature preferred by the alligator cells. This research demonstrates the ability of wild-type influenza viruses to infect and replicate within two crocodilian substrates and suggests the need for further research to assess crocodilians as a species potentially susceptible to influenza virus infection.","Temple, Bradley L; Finger, John W; Jones, Cheryl A; Gabbard, Jon D; Jelesijevic, Tomislav; Uhl, Elizabeth W; Hogan, Robert J; Glenn, Travis C; Tompkins, S Mark",Journal of wildlife diseases,425,33

METHODS The study population comprised 100 CKD patients who were divided into patients maintained on HD (n = 60; M/F = 28:32) and patients not maintained on HD (n = 40; M/F = 24:16). Patients were observed overnight using the pulse-oximetry technique and further subdivided into patients with SDB and patients without SDB, according to their calculated oxygen desaturation index (cutoff 5). All patients were subjected also to estimation of Kt/V ratio (which is a measure for the efficiency of HD), body-composition analysis, biochemical analysis, muscle functional capacity, and QoL measurements using standard methods and questionnaires, respectively. RESULTS Primary outcomes were intergroup differences regarding physical capacity and muscle performance, QoL, and body-composition measurements. CKD patients in general, either maintained on HD or not, suffer from SDB, and the levels of urea and creatinine may increase the incidence of SDB in CKD patients not maintained on HD. CKD patients maintained on HD with SDB had poorer functional capacity, physical performance, and muscle composition, in comparison with those without SDB. CONCLUSIONS Overall, SDB appears to partly contribute to the total diminished functional capacity of HD patients. Thus, CKD patients maintained on HD with SDB had significantly lower sleep quality and QoL as compared to those not maintained on HD with or without SDB.","Khalil, Eman S-D; Mohamed, Ehab I; Khalil, Gihane I; Sallam, Samera M; Mohamed, Shaimaa S; Naga, Salah S; Mowafy, Mohamed N",Sleep & breathing = Schlaf & Atmung,425,32

We discuss evolutionary contexts that modulate this variability and hypotheses postulated to explain them; for example, a small amount of melanin in the skin facilitates vitamin D production, making it advantageous to have fair skin in an environment with little radiation incidence. In contrast, more melanin protects folate from degradation in an environment with a high incidence of radiation. Some Native American populations have a skin color at odds with what would be expected for the amount of radiation in the environment in which they live, a finding challenging the so-called ""vitamin D-folate hypothesis."" Since food is also a source of vitamin D, dietary habits should also be considered. Here we argue that a gene network approach provides tools to explain this phenomenon since it indicates potential alleles co-evolving in a compensatory way. We identified alleles of the vitamin D metabolism and pigmentation pathways segregated together, but in different proportions, in agriculturalists and hunter-gatherers. Finally, we highlight how an evolutionary approach can be useful to understand current topics of medical interest.","Missaggia, Bruna Oliveira; Reales, Guillermo; Cybis, Gabriela B; Hünemeier, Tábita; Bortolini, Maria Cátira","American journal of medical genetics.

With the widespread cancellations of clinical and academic activities, educators are looking to technological advancements to help 'bridge the gap' and continue medical education. SOLUTIONS Simulation-based training as the 'gold standard' for medical education has limitations that prevent widespread adoption outside suitably resourced centres. Virtual reality has the potential to surmount these barriers, whilst fulfilling the fundamental aim of simulation-based training to provide a safe, effective and realistic learning environment. CURRENT LIMITATIONS AND INSIGHTS FOR FUTURE The main limitations of virtual reality technology include comfort and the restrictive power of mobile processors. There exists a clear developmental path to address these restrictions. Continued developments of the hardware and software set to deepen immersion and widen the possibilities within surgical education. CONCLUSION In the post coronavirus disease 2019 educational landscape, virtual, augmented and mixed reality technology may prove invaluable in the training of the next generation of surgeons.","Abbas, J R; Kenth, J J; Bruce, I A",The Journal of laryngology and otology,425,12

However, the resultant doctors' workload of reading mammographic scans needs to be addressed. Although computer-aided detection (CAD) systems have been developed to support readers, the findings are conflicting regarding whether traditional CAD systems improve reading performance. Rapid progress in the artificial intelligence (AI) field has led to the advent of newer CAD systems using deep learning-based algorithms which have the potential to reach human performance levels. Those systems, however, have been developed using mammography images mainly from women in western countries. Because Asian women characteristically have higher-density breasts, it is uncertain whether those AI systems can apply to Japanese women. In this study, we will construct a deep learning-based CAD system trained using mammography images from a large number of Japanese women with high quality reading. METHODS We will collect digital mammography images taken for screening or diagnostic purposes at multiple institutions in Japan. A total of 15,000 images, consisting of 5000 images with breast cancer and 10,000 images with benign lesions, will be collected. At least 1000 images of normal breasts will also be collected for use as reference data. With these data, we will construct a deep learning-based AI system to detect breast cancer on mammograms. The primary endpoint will be the sensitivity and specificity of the AI system with the test image set. DISCUSSION When the ability of AI reading is shown to be on a par with that of human reading, images of normal breasts or benign lesions that do not have to be read by a human can be selected by AI beforehand. Our AI might work well in Asian women who have similar breast density, size, and shape to those of Japanese women. TRIAL REGISTRATION UMIN, trial number UMIN000039009.

Most of the existing literature reports on the cannabinoids Δ9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD), or cannabis in general. There are many cannabis strains that vary widely in the composition of cannabinoids, terpenes, flavonoids, and other compounds. These components work synergistically to produce wide variations in benefits, side effects, and strain characteristics. Knowledge of the individual medicinal properties of the cannabinoids, terpenes, and flavonoids is necessary to cross-breed strains to obtain optimal standardized synergistic compositions. This will enable targeting individual symptoms and/or diseases, including migraine, headache, and pain. OBJECTIVE Review the medical literature for the use of cannabis/cannabinoids in the treatment of migraine, headache, facial pain, and other chronic pain syndromes, and for supporting evidence of a potential role in combatting the opioid epidemic. Review the medical literature involving major and minor cannabinoids, primary and secondary terpenes, and flavonoids that underlie the synergistic entourage effects of cannabis. Summarize the individual medicinal benefits of these substances, including analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties. CONCLUSION There is accumulating evidence for various therapeutic benefits of cannabis/cannabinoids, especially in the treatment of pain, which may also apply to the treatment of migraine and headache. There is also supporting evidence that cannabis may assist in opioid detoxification and weaning, thus making it a potential weapon in battling the opioid epidemic. Cannabis science is a rapidly evolving medical sector and industry with increasingly regulated production standards. Further research is anticipated to optimize breeding of strain-specific synergistic ratios of cannabinoids, terpenes, and other phytochemicals for predictable user effects, characteristics, and improved symptom and disease-targeted therapies.","Baron, Eric P",Headache,425,16

The first case was a 59-year-old man, transplanted 3 months ago, with recent history of slight BKV viremia (3.3 log10 DNA copies/ml). Despite strong reduction of maintenance immunosuppression (interruption of mycophenolic acid and important decrease of calcineurin inhibitors), BKV replication largely increased after Covid-19 and viremia persisted at 4.5 log copy/ml few months later.

We aimed to compare the longer-term efficacy of IRE to the standard thermal technique of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in HCC. METHODS All patients who underwent IRE or RFA for HCC in our centre were identified and demographic and clinical data were analysed up until 1st March, 2020. Local recurrence-free survival (LRFS) was compared between groups after propensity score matching for age, gender, Child-Pugh grade, BCLC stage, lesion size and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level. RESULTS A total of 190 HCC ablations (31 IRE and 159 RFA) were identified. After propensity score matching, we compared 25 IRE procedures (76% males, median age 62.4 years, median tumour size 20 mm) to 96 RFA procedures (84.4% males, median age 64.3 years, median tumour size 18.5 mm). LRFS did not differ between groups, with a 1-, 2- and 5-year LRFS of 80.4% (95% CI 55.8-92.2), 69.1% (95% CI 43.3-84.9) and 44.9% (95% CI 18.9-68.1%), respectively for IRE and 84.8% (95% CI 75.2-90.9), 71.3% (95% CI 58.3-81.0) and 52.1% (95% CI 35.4-66.4%), respectively for RFA (p = .63). There were no major procedure-related complications or deaths in either group. CONCLUSIONS Whilst IRE remains a relatively novel therapy for HCC cases where standard thermal ablation is contraindicated, the LRFS in our centre is comparable to that of RFA. IRE should therefore be considered as a treatment option in such cases when available before stage-migration to non-curative therapies such as transarterial chemoembolization (TACE).","Freeman, Elliot; Cheung, Wa; Ferdousi, Sapphire; Kavnoudias, Helen; Majeed, Ammar; Kemp, William; Roberts, Stuart K",Scandinavian journal of gastroenterology,425,28

In this study, we report the molecular characteristics and pharmacological activity of CXCR1 (MsCXCR1) in largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) and evaluated the functional involvement of MsCXCR1 in individuals infected with the pathogen Nocardia seriolae. MsCXCR1 was cloned into the pEGFP-N1 plasmid and the subcellular localization of MsCXCR1 on the cell membrane was verified in MsCXCR1-EGFP-expressing HEK293 cells. Following observation of receptor internalization and intracellular signaling detection, we further determined the functional interaction of secreted interleukin-8 (LcIL-8, the ligand for CXCR1 in large yellow croaker) and MsCXCR1 was further determined, and the ERK phosphorylation signal activation mediated by MsCXCR1 was demonstrated. Quantitative real-time PCR assays were conducted to analyze the transcriptional distribution of MsCXCR1 in various tissues of healthy and diseased largemouth bass. These results illustrate the significant elevation of MsCXCR1 expression in the head kidney, spleen and liver of M. salmoides, suggesting that MsCXCR1 was involved in the immune response in N. seriolae-infected largemouth bass and potentially affects the digestive function of this species.","Feng, Jiaqian; Han, Tao; Zhang, Yuexing; Zhang, Bing; Huang, Dexiang; Wang, Tianming; Yang, Jingwen",Tissue & cell,425,7

Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) improves clinical outcomes in KD patients only if delivered pre-symptomatically. Here, we hypothesize that the restricted temporal efficacy of HSCT reflects a requirement for GALC in early brain development. Using a novel Galc floxed allele, we induce ubiquitous GALC ablation (Galc-iKO) at various postnatal timepoints and identify a critical period of vulnerability to GALC ablation between P4-6 in mice. Early Galc-iKO induction causes a worse KD phenotype, higher psychosine levels in the rodent brainstem and spinal cord, and a significantly shorter life-span of the mice. Intriguingly, GALC expression peaks during this critical developmental period in mice. Further analysis of this mouse model reveals a cell autonomous role for GALC in the development and maturation of immature T-box-brain-1 positive brainstem neurons. These data identify a perinatal developmental period, in which neuronal GALC expression influences brainstem development that is critical for KD pathogenesis.","Weinstock, Nadav I; Kreher, Conlan; Favret, Jacob; Nguyen, Duc; Bongarzone, Ernesto R; Wrabetz, Lawrence; Laura Feltri, M; Shin, Daesung",Nature communications,425,28

Reovirus infection elicits production of type I interferons (IFNs), which trigger antiviral pathways through the induction of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Although hundreds of ISGs have been identified, the functions of many of these genes are unknown. The interferon-inducible transmembrane (IFITM) proteins are one class of ISGs that restrict the cell entry of some enveloped viruses, including influenza A virus. One family member, IFITM3, localizes to late endosomes, where reoviruses undergo proteolytic disassembly; therefore, we sought to determine whether IFITM3 also restricts reovirus entry. IFITM3-expressing cell lines were less susceptible to infection by reovirus, as they exhibited significantly lower percentages of infected cells in comparison to control cells. Reovirus replication was also significantly reduced in IFITM3-expressing cells. Additionally, cells expressing an shRNA targeting IFITM3 exhibited a smaller decrease in infection after IFN treatment than the control cells, indicating that endogenous IFITM3 restricts reovirus infection. However, IFITM3 did not restrict entry of reovirus infectious subvirion particles (ISVPs), which do not require endosomal proteolysis, indicating that restriction occurs in the endocytic pathway. Proteolysis of outer capsid protein μ1 was delayed in IFITM3-expressing cells in comparison to control cells, suggesting that IFITM3 modulates the function of late endosomal compartments either by reducing the activity of endosomal proteases or delaying the proteolytic processing of virions. These data provide the first evidence that IFITM3 restricts infection by a nonenveloped virus and suggest that IFITM3 targets an increasing number of viruses through a shared requirement for endosomes during cell entry.","Anafu, Amanda A; Bowen, Christopher H; Chin, Christopher R; Brass, Abraham L; Holm, Geoffrey H",The Journal of biological chemistry,425,1

METHODS We conducted our study in a comprehensive stroke care unit in Melbourne, Australia that offers a 24-hour mechanical thrombectomy service. ML algorithms including K-nearest neighbors, decision tree, random forest, support vector machine and ensemble models were trained and tested on a public WiFi dataset and the study hospital WiFi dataset. The hospital dataset was collected using the WiFi explorer software (version 3.0.2) on a MacBook Pro (AirPort Extreme, Broadcom BCM43x×1.0). Data analysis was implemented in the Python programming environment using the scikit-learn package. The primary statistical measure for algorithm performance was the accuracy of location prediction. RESULTS ML-based WiFi fingerprinting can accurately predict the different hospital zones relevant in the acute endovascular intervention workflow such as emergency department, CT room and angiography suite.

Overall, our study is a useful supplement to encourage regulatory bodies to promote changes in environmental policies as pollution source control can reduce the harmful effects of environmental pollutants.","Bashir, Muhammad Farhan; Bilal, BenJiang Ma; Komal, Bushra",Environmental research,425,1

Although the rapidity with which the virus struck was indeed overwhelming, scientists throughout the world have also been up to the task of deciphering the mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 induces the multisystem- and multiorgan-inflammatory response that, collectively, contribute to the high mortality rate in affected individuals. In this issue of the JCI, Skendros et al., is one such team who report that the complement system plays a substantial role in creating the hyper-inflammation and thrombotic microangiopathy that appear to contribute to the severity of COVID-19. In support of the hypothesis that the complement system along with neutrophils and platelets contributes to COVID-19, the authors presented empirical evidence showing that treatment with the complement inhibitor, compstatin Cp-40, inhibited the expression of tissue factor in neutrophils. These results confirm that the complement axis plays a critical role and suggests that targeted therapy using complement inhibitors is a potential therapeutic option to treat COVID-19 induced inflammation.","Ghebrehiwet, Berhane; Peerschke, Ellinor I",The Journal of clinical investigation,425,1

By contrast, gut Th22 cells are usually restored at normal frequencies. Th22 cells display a CCR6+CCR10+ phenotype and could thus respond to CCL20- and CCL28-mediated chemotaxis, while Th17 cells, which express CCR6 but not CCR10, depend on CCL20. Herein, we found that CCL28 is normally expressed by duodenal enterocytes of treated HIV-1-infected individuals, while CCL20 expression is blunted. Ex vivo, we showed that Th22 cells contribute to the reduction of CCL20 production by enterocytes through an IL-22- and IL-18-dependent mechanism. Th22 cells preferentially migrate via CCL20- rather than CCL28-mediated chemotaxis when both chemokines are available in the microenvironment. However, when the CCL20/CCL28 ratio drops, as in treated HIV-1-infected individuals, Th22 cells can migrate via the CCR10-CCL28 axis, as an alternative to CCR6-CCL20. This could explain the better reconstitution of gut Th22 compared with Th17 cells on antiretroviral therapy. Lastly, we assessed the relationships between the frequencies of gut Th17 and Th22 cells and inflammatory markers related to microbial translocation, and showed that Th22 cells do not compensate for the loss of Th17 cells in treated HIV-1-infected individuals.","Nayrac, Manon; Requena, Mary; Loiseau, Claire; Cazabat, Michelle; Suc, Bertrand; Carrere, Nicolas; Barange, Karl; Alric, Laurent; Martin-Blondel, Guillaume; Izopet, Jacques; Delobel, Pierre",Mucosal immunology,425,31

However, in 2013, an association between brain MRI abnormalities and a history of GBCA administration was first reported. Even in patients with normal renal function, increased signal intensity in the dentate nucleus and globus pallidus on unenhanced T1-weighted images showed a positive correlation with previous exposure to linear chelate type GBCAs, but not to macrocyclic chelate type ones. This difference of GBCAs is speculated to reflect the stability of GBCAs, and de-chelated gadolinium deposition has been strongly suspected. Using inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy, gadolinium was detected from patients' brains with a history of repeated GBCA administration. In some cases, the gadolinium concentration of a patient's brain with normal renal function exceeded the gadolinium concentration of the skin in nephrogenic systemic fibrosis patients, but without any histological change. The actual risk has not been documented yet, but it seems important to consider the potential unknown risks of residual gadolinium in our decisions regarding GBCA administration, and to make efforts to minimize any residual gadolinium in the patient's body.","Kanda, Tomonori; Oba, Hiroshi; Toyoda, Keiko; Kitajima, Kazuhiro; Furui, Shigeru",Japanese journal of radiology,425,24

METHODS During 2 simulation-based Comprehensive Cleft Care Workshops organized by Global Smile Foundation, participants and faculty members filled a survey. Surveys included demographic and geographic data and investigated the most relevant barrier to multidisciplinary cleft care and the most significant intervention to deliver comprehensive cleft care in outreach settings, as perceived by participants. RESULTS The total response rate was 57.8%. Respondents reported that the greatest barrier to comprehensive cleft care was financial, and the most relevant intervention to deliver multidisciplinary cleft care was building multidisciplinary teams. Stratification by age, gender, and geographical area showed no statistical difference in reporting that the greatest barrier to cleft care was financial. However, lack of multidisciplinary teams was the most important barrier according to respondents with less than 5 years of experience (P = 0.03). Stratification by gender, years in practice, specialty, and geographical area showed no statistical difference, with building multidisciplinary teams reported as the most significant intervention. However, increased training was reported as the main intervention to cleft care for those aged less than 30 years old (P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS Our study delivers an assessment for barriers facing multidisciplinary cleft care delivery and interventions required to improve cleft care delivery. The authors are hoping that stratification by demographic and geographic factors will help them delineate community-specific road maps to refine cleft care delivery.","Kantar, Rami S; Abyad, Omar Al; Melhem, Antonio; Chahine, Elsa M; Kassam, Serena N; Annan, Beyhan; Nader, Marie K; Keith, Kristen; Breugem, Corstiaan C; Hamdan, Usama S",The Journal of craniofacial surgery,425,1

However, the interindividual pharmacokinetic variability of imatinib and nilotinib is found to be moderate-high. This study aims to analyze the relationship between TKI C m i n ∞ ${C}_{min}\hat{\infty }$ and BCL-ABL ratio in chronic-phase CML patients. Methods Cross-sectional study to CML chronic-phase patients treated with imatinib 400 mg daily or nilotinib 400 or 800 mg daily for ≥12 months. The exclusion criteria were therapy discontinuation within 29 days (imatinib) or 8 days (nilotinib) before the sampling day. Blood samples were drawn 1 h before the next dose. Imatinib-nilotinib C m i n ∞ ${C}_{min}\hat{\infty }$ and BCR-ABL ratio were measured using HPLC and RT-qPCR. The relationship was analyzed using bivariate correlation Spearman's rho test.

Still, its safety and efficacy as a respiratory support method for patients with hypoxemic ARF hasn't been studied so well. AIM The aim of our study was to examine the safety and efficacy of NIV in hypoxemic ARF of primary lung origin. MATERIALS AND METHODS This was a prospective observational cohort study of patients with hypoxemic ARF due to communityacquired pneumonia with or without acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) treated using NIV. They were divided into four groups: pneumonia without ARDS, mild, moderate, or severe ARDS. Their clinical and ABG parameters were recorded before initiation of NIV, at 1 hour and 24 hours after ventilation onset and at transition to non-intensive NIV or before endotracheal intubation in NIV failure cases. RESULTS A total of 63 patients were included. NIV trial was successful in 85.71% of them, while 14.29% experienced NIV failure. In the general population, we observed a significant difference in PaO2/FiO2 only before transition to non-intensive NIV in comparison to the value at admission. This trend was seen in the patients with pneumonia without ARDS and moderate ARDS, but not in those with mild and severe ARDS. The clinical parameters showed improvement early in the course of treatment both in the entire study population and all subgroups. CONCLUSIONS NIV is an effective and safe option for respiratory support in patients with severe CAP only when an adequate etiological treatment has been applied.","Ilieva, Viktoria; Yamakova, Yordanka",Folia medica,425,2

In a modified intent-to-treat analysis, the hazard ratio for stroke was 1.18 (95% confidence interval, 0.89-1.56; P=0.26). We further investigated cerebrovascular events. METHODS Patients were randomized to empagliflozin 10 mg, empagliflozin 25 mg, or placebo; 7020 patients were treated. Median observation time was 3.1 years. RESULTS The numeric difference in stroke between empagliflozin and placebo in the modified intent-to-treat analysis was primarily because of 18 patients in the empagliflozin group with a first event >90 days after last intake of study drug (versus 3 on placebo). In a sensitivity analysis based on events during treatment or ≤90 days after last dose of drug, the hazard ratio for stroke with empagliflozin versus placebo was 1.08 (95% confidence interval, 0.81-1.45; P=0.60). There were no differences in risk of recurrent, fatal, or disabling strokes, or transient ischemic attack, with empagliflozin versus placebo. Patients with the largest increases in hematocrit or largest decreases in systolic blood pressure did not have an increased risk of stroke.

Parameters evaluated were technical success, technical efficacy, tumour diameter, tumour and ablation volume, complication rate, 90-day mortality, local tumour progression (LTP) at the 12-month follow-up, ablative margin and ablation zone sphericity. These parameters were compared using the Kruskal-Wallis test with the same parameters collected retrospectively from cohorts of patients treated with conventional high-frequency (HF) MWA (n = 20) or low-frequency (LF) MWA (n = 20). RESULTS Technical success was achieved in all interventions. The technical efficacy was 100% (ECSEC) vs. 100% (LF-MWA) vs. 95% (HF-MWA). There were no intra-procedural deaths or major complications. Minor complications occurred in 3.57% (2/56), 0% (0/20) and 0% (0/20) of the patients, respectively. The one-year mortality rate was 16.1% (9/56), 15% (3/20) and 10% (2/20), respectively. The LTP was 3.57% (2/56), 5% (1/20) and 5% (1/20), respectively. The median deviation from ideal sphericity (1.0) was 0.135 (ECSEC) vs. 0.344 (LF-MWA) vs. 0.314 (HF-MWA) (p < 0.001).

We measured the SAA concentrations in healthy cats (n = 98) and those with various clinical signs (n = 444). The SAA concentrations in healthy cats did not differ significantly by age, breed, sex, and presence/absence of neutering/spaying. The SAA concentrations were significantly higher in the diseased cat group than in the healthy cat group (p < 0.001).

RESULTS More than 2 in 3 of the overall cohort had had contacts with the health and social care system prior to diagnosis. This figure rose to 85% in those 70 years and over. In the older cohort, the most common reasons for presentation were shortness of breath or falls, and 1 in 3 had neither cough nor fever. CONCLUSION COVID-19 can present differently in the elderly, overlapping with many common presentations, so focusing testing on those with a cough or fever will miss at least 1 in 3 cases in those over the age of 70.

Surgical treatment for IHs include a solely open or solely laparoscopic approach with mesh placement. Recently, hybrid (combined laparoscopic and open) approaches have been introduced. This systematic review evaluates perioperative complications of hybrid incisional hernia repair (HIHR). METHODS EMBASE, Medline via OvidSP, Web of Science, Cochrane and Google Scholar databases were searched. Studies providing data on intra- and postoperative complications in patients who underwent HIHR were included. Data on intra- and postoperative complications were extracted and meta-analyses were performed. Study quality was assessed with the Newcastle Ottowa Scale, ROBINS-I tool, and Cochrane risk of bias. PROSPERO registration: CRD42020175053. RESULTS Eleven studies (n = 1681 patients) were included. Five studies compared intra-operative complications between HIHR and laparoscopic incisional hernia repair (LIHR) with a pooled incidence of 1.8% in HIHR group and 2.8% in LIHR group (p = 0.13). Comparison of postoperative prevalence of surgical site occurrences (SSOs) (23% versus 26%, p = 0.02) and surgical site occurrences requiring interventions (SSOPIs) (1.5% versus 4.1%, p < 0.01) were in favour of the HIHR group. Overall postoperative complications seemed to occur less frequent in the HIHR group, though no hard statements could be made due to the vast heterogeneity in reporting between studies. CONCLUSION Although the majority of studies were retrospective and included a small number of patients, HIHR seemingly led to less SSOs and SSOPIs.

Without liming and with high Mn doses, leaf Mn concentrations reached 13,452 and 12,127 mg kg-1 in sandstone and basalt soils, respectively; concentrations in excess of 10,000 mg kg-1 are characteristic of hyperaccumulating plants. Liming reduced these values to 7203 and 8030 mg kg-1. More plant growth accompanied increased Mn leaf concentrations, with a growth reduction noted at the highest dose in unlimed soils. Elemental distribution showed Mn presence in the mesophyll, primarily in vascular bundles, without high Mn precipitates. Interveinal chlorosis of young leaves associated with high Mn concentration and lower Fe concentrations was observed, especially in sandstone soil without liming. However, the occurrence of this symptom was not associated with decreased plant growth.","Magri, Ederlan; Gugelmin, Eduardo Kieras; Grabarski, Felipe Augusto Piacentini; Barbosa, Julierme Zimmer; Auler, André Carlos; Wendling, Ivar; Prior, Stephen Arthur; Valduga, Alice Teresa; Motta, Antônio Carlos Vargas",Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,425,22

Some centers have begun securing aneurysms with coil embolization followed by clot evacuation in the operating room. This approach requires transporting a patient from the angiography suite to the operating room, which can take valuable time and resources. OBJECTIVE To report our experience with 3 cases in which a novel technique for minimally invasive evacuation of intracerebral hematomas after endovascular treatment of ruptured intracranial aneurysms was used. The Penumbra Apollo system can be used in the angiography suite in conjunction with neuroendovascular techniques to simultaneously address a symptomatic hematoma associated with a ruptured aneurysm. METHODS Standard preoperative computed tomography angiography was performed on arrival to the emergency department. The patients underwent diagnostic cerebral angiography followed by balloon-assisted coil embolization and then remained in the neurointerventional suite for intracerebral hematoma evacuation with the Apollo system. RESULTS All patients tolerated coil embolization and hematoma evacuation well. The combined procedures lasted <3 hours in both cases. Two patients were eventually discharged to acute rehabilitation facilities less than a month after their initial insult, and 1 has been cleared to return to work. The other patient was transferred to hospice care. CONCLUSION The Apollo aspiration system appears to be a safe and effective minimally invasive option for intracerebral hematoma evacuation, particularly when coupled with endovascular embolization of ruptured intracranial aneurysms. Future work will address which patient population is most likely to benefit from this promising technique.","Turner, Raymond D; Vargas, Jan; Turk, Aquilla S; Chaudry, M Imran; Spiotta, Alejandro M",Neurosurgery,425,1

We describe our experience in the endovascular recanalization of tandem vertebrobasilar occlusions using endovascular techniques. The BA was accessed through the normal VA (clean-road) or the occluded, thrombotic VA (dirty-road), and stentriever-based thrombectomy was performed using antegrade or reverse revascularization variants. Seven patients underwent successful stentriever-assisted mechanical thrombectomy of the BA and five sustained concomitant VA revascularization. Stroke onset to endovascular intervention initiation (time-to-treatment) ranged from 4.5-13hours (mean 8.6). In two of seven patients, the BA occlusion was approached with a 'clean-road' approach via the contralateral VA; in five of seven patients, a 'dirty-road' approach via the occluded VA was used. Mean time-to-recanalization was 66minutes (range 55-82). There were no perforations, iatrogenic vessel dissections, or other technical complications. Four patients presented mild-to-moderate disability (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] 0-3) at 3months, one remained with moderate-to-severe disability (mRS 4), and two patients died on days 9 and 23 after their strokes. Follow-up ranged from 6-45months (mean 24months). In selected patients with acute VA-BA occlusion, stentriever-based thrombectomy performed through either the patent or the occluded VA, may be feasible, effective, and safe. Clinical outcomes in these patients seem to equipoise the neurological outcome of patients with successful revascularization for isolated BA occlusion. This unique pair of occlusions confirms the role of VA ostium stenosis as a cause of vertebrobasilar stroke.","Cohen, José E; Leker, Ronen R; Gomori, J Moshe; Eichel, Roni; Rajz, Gustavo; Moscovici, Samuel; Itshayek, Eyal",Journal of clinical neuroscience : official journal of the Neurosurgical Society of Australasia,425,31

This review is to describe the existing knowledge on art making and expressive art therapy in adult health and nursing care between 2010 and 2020. Methods Relevant studies and grey literature were searched and identified between March 17 and April 10, 2020 from EBSCO, CINAHL, Medline and ERIC databases and a general Internet search. Following data charting and extraction, the data (n = 42 papers) were summarized and reported in accordance with PRISMA-ScR guidelines. Results In the included papers, both art making and expressive art therapy were seen in different health care and nursing contexts: yet not the home care context. The emphasis of art activities were group activities for chronically or terminally ill residents, adults aged 65 years or older. A focus on personal narrative was often seen, which may explain why art activities appear to be linked to acknowledging and building new strengths and skills, making meaning of experiences, personal growth, symptom alleviation, and communication; all used to foster collaboration between patients, patients' near-ones and health care professionals. Conclusions Art activities appear to be suitable for every context and can promote personcenteredness and the measurement of nursing outcomes, and they should be considered an essential part of health and nursing care, nursing education and care for health care personnel.","Vaartio-Rajalin, Heli; Santamäki-Fischer, Regina; Jokisalo, Pamela; Fagerström, Lisbeth",International journal of nursing sciences,425,16

Institutions consider how much weight to give activities in each of these areas and determine a threshold for advancement. With the emergence of social media, scholars can engage wider audiences in creative ways and have a broader impact. Conventional metrics like the h-index do not account for social media impact. Social media engagement is poorly represented in most curricula vitae (CV) and therefore is undervalued in promotion and tenure reviews. OBJECTIVE The objective was to develop crowdsourced guidelines for documenting social media scholarship. These guidelines aimed to provide a structure for documenting a scholar's general impact on social media, as well as methods of documenting individual social media contributions exemplifying innovation, education, mentorship, advocacy, and dissemination. METHODS To create unifying guidelines, we created a crowdsourced process that capitalized on the strengths of social media and generated a case example of successful use of the medium for academic collaboration. The primary author created a draft of the guidelines and then sought input from users on Twitter via a publicly accessible Google Document. There was no limitation on who could provide input and the work was done in a democratic, collaborative fashion. Contributors edited the draft over a period of 1 week (September 12-18, 2020). The primary and secondary authors then revised the draft to make it more concise. The guidelines and manuscript were then distributed to the contributors for edits and adopted by the group. All contributors were given the opportunity to serve as coauthors on the publication and were told upfront that authorship would depend on whether they were able to document the ways in which they met the 4 International Committee of Medical Journal Editors authorship criteria. RESULTS We developed 2 sets of guidelines: Guidelines for Listing All Social Media Scholarship Under Public Scholarship (in Research/Scholarship Section of CV) and Guidelines for Listing Social Media Scholarship Under Research, Teaching, and Service Sections of CV. Institutions can choose which set fits their existing CV format. CONCLUSIONS With more uniformity, scholars can better represent the full scope and impact of their work. These guidelines are not intended to dictate how individual institutions should weigh social media contributions within promotion and tenure cases. Instead, by providing an initial set of guidelines, we hope to provide scholars and their institutions with a common format and language to document social media scholarship.","Acquaviva, Kimberly D; Mugele, Josh; Abadilla, Natasha; Adamson, Tyler; Bernstein, Samantha L; Bhayani, Rakhee K; Büchi, Annina Elisabeth; Burbage, Darcy; Carroll, Christopher L; Davis, Samantha P; Dhawan, Natasha; English, Kim; Grier, Jennifer T; Gurney, Mary K; Hahn, Emily S; Haq, Heather; Huang, Brendan; Jain, Shikha; Jun, Jin; Kerr, Wesley T; Keyes, Timothy; Kirby, Amelia R; Leary, Marion; Marr, Mollie; Major, Ajay; Meisel, Jason V; Petersen, Erika A; Raguan, Barak; Rhodes, Allison; Rupert, Deborah D; Sam-Agudu, Nadia A; Saul, Naledi; Shah, Jarna R; Sheldon, Lisa Kennedy; Sinclair, Christian T; Spencer, Kerry; Strand, Natalie H; Streed, Carl G; Trudell, Avery M",Journal of medical Internet research,425,1

Smoke from wildfires worsened the situation of isolated, as well as urban communities, already under an increasing toll of COVID-19. Here we review the impacts and the possible causes of the 2020 mega-fires and recommend improvements for public policies and fire management in this wetland. We calculated the amount of area burnt annually since 2003 and describe patterns in precipitation and water level measurements of the Paraguay River. Our analyses revealed that the 2020 wildfires were historically unprecedented, as 43% of the area (over 17,200 km2) had not been burnt previously in the last two decades. The extent of area affected in 2020 represents a 376% increase compared to the annual average of the area burnt annually in the last two decades, double than the value in 2019. Potential factors responsible for this increase are (i) severe drought decreased water levels, (ii) the fire corridor was located in the Paraguay River flood zone, (iii) constraints on firefighters, (iv) insufficient fire prevention strategy and agency budget reductions, and (v) recent landscape changes. Climate and land use change will further increase the frequency of these extreme events. To make fire management more efficient and cost-effective, we recommend the implementation of an Integrated Fire Management program in the Pantanal. Stakeholders should use existing traditional, local ecological, and scientific knowledge to form a collective strategy with clear, achievable, measurable goals, considering the socio-ecological context. Permanent fire brigades, including indigenous members, should conduct year-round fire management. Communities should cooperate to create a collaborative network for wildfire prevention, the location and characteristics (including flammability) of infrastructures should be (re)planned in fire-prone environments considering and managing fire-catalysed transitions, and depending on the severity of wildfires. The 2020 wildfires were tackled in an ad-hoc fashion and prioritisation of areas for urgent financial investment, management, protection, and restoration is necessary to prevent this catastrophe from happening again.","Garcia, Letícia Couto; Szabo, Judit K; de Oliveira Roque, Fabio; de Matos Martins Pereira, Alexandre; Nunes da Cunha, Catia; Damasceno-Júnior, Geraldo Alves; Morato, Ronaldo Gonçalves; Tomas, Walfrido Moraes; Libonati, Renata; Ribeiro, Danilo Bandini",Journal of environmental management,425,20

We describe the decision-making and implementation-processes that our hospital used regarding the choice of device. We compared the performances of 4 Macintosh-VLs both in direct and indirect laryngoscopy. METHODS A quality-improvement-project for airway management aiming at implementing Macintosh-VL for all intubation procedures performed in the operating room, involving 4 Macintosh-VLs (McGrath-Mac, C-MAC-S, C-MAC-S-Pocket-Monitor [PM], and APA). Three consecutive steps were described: (1) direct laryngoscopy with Macintosh-VL, (2) indirect laryngoscopy with Macintosh-VL (intubation attempt with Macintosh-style blade in case of Cormack I or II), (3) intubation attempt with hyperangulated blade in case of Cormack III/IV or failure of Macintosh-style blade. The main end point was the need to move to step III and use a hyperangulated blade. A mixed-effects multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to compare devices on the main end point while considering site as a random effect. Comparison of means was performed using analysis of variance and Tukey's test for multiple comparisons (number of laryngoscopy attempts, numeric rate scale [NRS] difficulty of intubation and NRS user-friendliness). Comparison of percentages was performed using a χ test for the need to move to step III and a Kruskal-Wallis test for the quality of image (bad, passable, good, very good, excellent). A P value ≤.008 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS From May to September 2017, 589 patients were included. Using the McGrath-Mac (22/180 [12%]) was associated with less use of hyperangulated blade than using the C-MAC-S (39/132 [30%], odds ratio [OR] [99.2% confidence interval {CI}] 0.34 [0.16-0.77], P = .0005), the APA (35/138 [25%], OR [99.2% CI] 0.42 [0.19-0.93]; P = .004), but not the C-MAC-S-PM (29/139 [21%], OR [99.2% CI] 0.53 [0.23-1.2]; P = .04).Overall, the number of intubation attempts was significantly lower using the McGrath Mac than the C-MAC-S or the C-MAC-S-PMVLs. Subjective appreciation of intubation difficulty and user-friendliness of the devices showed respectively lower and higher NRS scores for the McGrath-Mac compared to the other devices, whereas subjective assessment of image quality showed higher quality for the C-MAC-S and C-MAC-S-PM compared to the APA or McGrath-Mac. CONCLUSIONS Among 4 single-use Macintosh-VLs, glottic visualization in direct and indirect laryngoscopy with the Macintosh-style blade was significantly improved with the McGrath-Mac compared to other Macintosh-VLs, leading to a less frequent need to resort to the hyperangulated blade and reduced overall number of intubation attempts.","De Jong, Audrey; Pouzeratte, Yvan; Laplace, Alexandre; Normanno, Marco; Rollé, Amélie; Verzilli, Daniel; Perrigault, Pierre-François; Colson, Pascal; Capdevila, Xavier; Molinari, Nicolas; Jaber, Samir",Anesthesia and analgesia,425,1

However, the degree of the association between mental health and chronic low back pain (CLBP) in the general population is poorly understood. The objective of this study was to analyze the incidence of CLBP in Chinese college students and to examine the association between students' unhealthy mental states and the prevalence of CLBP. Methods This is a cross-sectional study. A total of 10,000 questionnaires were distributed in the second semester of the 2017-2018 academic year by the School of Medicine, Shanghai JiaoTong University. Eligible participants were students aged ≥ 18 years from randomly selected Chinese colleges. Participants completed a questionnaire survey that included items from the Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90) and items on demographic factors, LBP prevalence, quality of life at their university, study-related stress and interpersonal relationships. The evaluation of students' mental states in the survey was divided into two major parts: direct and indirect indicators. A multivariate logistic regression model was mainly used to explore the relationship between CLBP and the students' mental health. Results There was a high incidence of CLBP in the college students. Multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that the risk of CLBP increased with increasing scores on the SCL-90, and a clinically unhealthy mental state (scores greater than 3) was significantly associated with CLBP (adjusted odds ratios for depression, anxiety, coercion, paranoia, and interpersonal sensitivity were 7.209, 6.593, 3.959, 4.465, and 4.283, respectively; p < 0.001). Participants who had poor living habits or uncomfortable campus lives and those who experienced heavy academic pressure also showed a higher positive association with CLBP compared with the full sample. Conclusions Unhealthy psychological conditions, which may be attributed to unsatisfying school lives, excessive learning pressure, and uncomfortable interpersonal relationships, represent a risk factor for CLBP in college students.","Mei, Qixiang; Li, Chunlin; Yin, Yue; Wang, Qi; Wang, Qiugen; Deng, Guoying",Child and adolescent psychiatry and mental health,425,24

To date, literature on the prognosis for AGC after LADG is scarce. This study evaluated the procedure's long-term benefits compared with those of the conventional, open distal gastrectomy (ODG). METHODS This study involved 201 patients, 66 of whom underwent LADG, with a mean follow-up period of 49.2 months, from January 1999 to March 2010. A clear set of criteria was used to select patients (including no evidence of lymph node metastasis) and surgeons (subject to their experience). Survival outcomes were assessed by Kaplan-Meier analysis and log-rank testing. The postoperative recovery and complications of the patients also were monitored. RESULTS No significant difference was observed between LADG and ODG in terms of overall survival or disease-specific survival. The corresponding 5-year survival rates for individual tumor node metastasis stages also were comparable in each group. The number of lymph nodes harvested was similar in the two groups, although the operation time was significantly shorter for ODG. The postoperative hospital stay was shorter for LADG patients (average stay of 8.4 vs. 18.1 days in the ODG group; p < 0.001), and the postoperative complication rate was almost half that for ODG (13.6 vs. 25.0 %; p = 0.048). CONCLUSION The combination of the long- and short-term data indicates that LADG should be considered as a feasible alternative to ODG for the treatment of AGC. Its widespread integration requires the accumulation of similar results across multiple centers worldwide.","Gordon, Andrew C; Kojima, Kazuyuki; Inokuchi, Mikito; Kato, Keiji; Sugihara, Kenichi",Surgical endoscopy,425,7

METHODS The leadership positions of all U.S. otolaryngology societies were compiled. The Medicare Physician Compare database was used to obtain gender and medical school graduation year for all otolaryngologists. An online search was used to determine board member's academic faculty rank. The Scopus database was used to determine an individual's number of publications, citations, and h-index. All websites were accessed from July 2019 to October 2019. RESULTS Of the 200 leadership positions, there were 160 unique individuals available for analysis. Of those, 23% were female. In comparison, 18% of all otolaryngologists in the United States are female. The average medical school graduation year was significantly more recent for female leaders (1997 vs. 1990, P < .001) than males, which is similar to all otolaryngologists (2001 vs. 1993, P < .001). Stratifying by gender alone, women averaged significantly fewer publications, citations, and h-indices compared to men (P < .05), and were also less likely to be professors (P < .01). When considering both gender and graduation year, significant differences among academic productivity were only noted for those graduating between 1990 to 1999. Among all board members who graduated after 2000, women comprised a majority of those in leadership positions (52%). CONCLUSION Leadership positions in otolaryngology societies reflect the changing demographic of otolaryngologists in the United States. There is proportionate representation, and the more recently graduated female physicians show the same research productivity as their male counterparts.

For early career and established scholars, navigating the mosaic landscape of public education and science communication, noted for rapid ""ecological"" succession, can be daunting. Moreover, academics are characterized by diverse skills, motivations, values, positionalities, and temperaments that may differentially incline individuals to particular public translation activities. METHODS Here we briefly contextualize engagement activities within a scholarly portfolio, describe the use of one public education program-March Mammal Madness (MMM)- to highlight approaches to science communication, and explore essential elements and practical considerations for creating and sustaining outreach pursuits in tandem with other scholarly activities. RESULTS MMM, an annual simulated tournament of living and fossil animal taxa, has reached hundreds of thousands of learners since 2013. This program has provided a platform to communicate research findings from biology and anthropology and showcase numerous scholars in these fields. MMM has leveraged tournament devices to intentionally address topics of climate change, capitalist environmental degradation, academic sexism, and racist settler-colonialism. The tournament, however, has also perpetuated implicit biases that need disrupting. CONCLUSIONS By embracing reflexive, self-interrogative, and growth attitudes, the tournament organizers iteratively refine and improve this public science education program to better align our activities with our values and goals. Our experiences with MMM suggest that dispersing science is most sustainable when we combine ancestral adaptations for cooperation, community, and storytelling with good-natured competition in the context of shared experiences and shared values.","Amorim, Carlos Eduardo G; Dasari, Mauna; Durgavich, Lara; Hinde, Katie; Kissel, Marc; Lewton, Kristi L; Loewen, Tisa",American journal of human biology : the official journal of the Human Biology Council,425,12

Method and results Briefly, from the recent literature, for high-risk PE presenting with shock or cardiac arrest, systemic thrombolysis or embolectomy is recommended, while for lowrisk PE, anticoagulation alone is proposed. Normo-tense patients with PE but with biological or imaging signs of right heart dysfunction constitute a group known as ""at intermediate risk"" for which the therapeutic strategy remains controversial. In fact, some patients may require more aggressive treatment in addition to the anticoagulant treatment, because approximately 10% will decompensate hemodynamically with a high risk of mortality. Systemic thrombolysis may be an option, but with hemorrhagic risks, particularly intra cranial. Various hybrid pharmacomechanical approaches are proposed to maintain the benefits of thrombolysis while reducing its risks, but the overall clinical experience of these different techniques remains limited. Patients with high intermediate and high risk pulmonary embolism should be managed by a multidisciplinary team combining the skills of cardiologists, resuscitators, pneumologists, interventional radiologists and cardiac surgeons. Such a team can determine which intervention - thrombolysis alone or assisted, percutaneous mechanical fragmentation of the thrombus or surgical embolectomy - is best suited to a particular patient. Conclusions This consensus document define the place of endovascular thrombectomy based on an appropriate risk stratification of PE.","Rousseau, Hervé; Del Giudice, Costantino; Sanchez, Olivier; Ferrari, Emile; Sapoval, Marc; Marek, Pierre; Delmas, Clément; Zadro, Charline; Revel-Mouroz, Paul",Heliyon,425,28

The incidence of IUI is low and dependent on the type of surgery (< 10 %), but it is associated with high morbidity. Therefore, intraoperative visualization of the ureter is critical to reduce the incidence of IUI, and some methodologies for ureter visualization have been developed. Amongst these, near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) visualization is thought to bring an advantage with real-time retroperitoneal visualization through the retroperitoneum. We investigated an indocyanine green (ICG) derivative, ASP5354, which emits NIRF at 820 nm when exposed to near-infrared light at a wavelength of 780 nm, in a rodent and porcine model. PROCEDURES Wistar rats and Göttingen minipigs under anesthesia were laparotomized and then administered ASP5354 chloride intravenously at dose of 0.03 and 0.3 mg/kg for rats and 0.001 and 0.01 mg/kg for minipigs, respectively. Videos of the abdominal cavity in minipigs were taken using a near-infrared fluorescent camera (pde-neo) and assessed visually by three independent clinicians. Toxicological evaluation was demonstrated with cynomolgus monkeys. RESULTS The proportion of animals whose ureters were visible up to 3 h after administration of ASP5354 chloride were 33 % at 0.001 mg/kg and 100 % at 0.01 mg/kg, respectively. In a toxicological study in cynomolgus monkeys, ASP5354 chloride demonstrated no significant toxicity, suggesting that 0.01 mg/kg provides an optimal dose when used clinically and could allow for ureter visualization during routine surgical procedures. CONCLUSIONS The dose of 0.01 mg/kg provided an optimal dose for ureter visualization up to 3 h after administration. ASP5354 shows promise for ureter visualization during abdominopelvic surgery, which may potentially lower the risk of IUI.","Fushiki, Hiroshi; Yoshikawa, Tomoaki; Matsuda, Toshihiro; Sato, Takeshi; Suwa, Akira",Molecular imaging and biology,425,5

We used ANOVA, t test, χ2 test, and Fisher's exact test for bivariate analyses and logistic regression for multivariable analysis. RESULTS Three hundred patients met the inclusion criteria for the study cohort. Multivariable analysis demonstrated that admission proteinuria was significantly associated with risk of in-hospital AKI (OR 4.71, 95% CI 1.28-17.38), while admission hematuria was associated with ICU admission (OR 4.56, 95% CI 1.12-18.64), IMV (OR 8.79, 95% CI 2.08-37.00), and death (OR 18.03, 95% CI 2.84-114.57). During hospitalization, de novo proteinuria was significantly associated with increased risk of death (OR 8.94, 95% CI 1.19-114.4, p = 0.04). In-hospital AKI increased (OR 27.14, 95% CI 4.44-240.17) while recovery from in-hospital AKI decreased the risk of death (OR 0.001, 95% CI 0.001-0.06). CONCLUSION Proteinuria and hematuria both at the time of admission and during hospitalization are associated with adverse clinical outcomes in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.","Chaudhri, Imran; Moffitt, Richard; Taub, Erin; Annadi, Raji R; Hoai, Minh; Bolotova, Olena; Yoo, Jeanwoo; Dhaliwal, Simrat; Sahib, Haseena; Daccueil, Farah; Hajagos, Janos; Saltz, Mary; Saltz, Joel; Mallipattu, Sandeep K; Koraishy, Farrukh M",Kidney & blood pressure research,425,1

METHODS We analyzed the reports of payments made to physicians by five manufacturers of total hip and knee prostheses in 2007. For each payment recipient who was an author of a presentation or served as a committee member or board member at the 2008 annual meeting of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, the disclosure statement was reviewed to determine whether the payment had been disclosed. To ascertain the reasons for nondisclosure, a survey was administered to physicians who had received payments that were not disclosed. RESULTS The overall rate of disclosure was 71.2% (245 of 344 payments). For payments that were directly related to the topic of the presentation at the meeting, the rate was 79.3% (165 of 208); for payments that were indirectly related, the rate was 50.0% (16 of 32); and for payments that were unrelated, the rate was 49.2% (29 of 59) (P=0.008). In the multivariate analysis, payments were also more likely to have been disclosed if they exceeded $10,000 (P<0.001), were directed toward an individual physician rather than a company or organization (P=0.04), or included an in-kind component (P=0.002). Among the 36 physicians who responded to the survey regarding reasons for nondisclosure (response rate, 39.6%), the reasons most commonly given for nondisclosure were that the payment was unrelated to the topic of presentation at the annual meeting (38.9% of respondents) and that the physician had misunderstood the disclosure requirements (13.9%); 11.1% reported that the payment had been disclosed but was mistakenly omitted from the program. CONCLUSIONS In this study of self-reported conflict-of-interest disclosure by physicians at a large annual meeting, the rate of disclosure was 79.3% for directly related payments and 50.0% for indirectly related payments.","Okike, Kanu; Kocher, Mininder S; Wei, Erin X; Mehlman, Charles T; Bhandari, Mohit",The New England journal of medicine,425,7

Circular RNAs (circRNAs) function as crucial regulatory factors in EndoMT. Nevertheless, the underlying mechanisms of circRNA HECW2 (circ_HECW2, hsa_circ_0057583) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced EndoMT remain largely unclear. The levels of circ_HECW2, miR-30e-5p and neuronal growth regulator 1 (NEGR1) were detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) or western blot. Ribonuclease (RNase) R and Actinomycin D assays were performed to validate the stability of circ_HECW2. Cell colony formation, proliferation and apoptosis were tested by a standard colony formation assay, the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS) assay and flow cytometry, respectively. Targeted relationships among circ_HECW2, miR-30e-5p and NEGR1 were verified by a dual-luciferase reporter assay. Our data indicated that LPS increased circ_HECW2 expression and reduced miR-30e-5p expression in human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs). Circ_HECW2 silencing promoted cell proliferation and suppressed cell apoptosis and EndoMT in LPS-treated HBMECs. Mechanistically, circ_HECW2 directly interacted with miR-30e-5p by binding to miR-30e-5p. MiR-30e-5p was a functional mediator of circ_HECW2 in regulating LPS-induced cell EndoMT. Furthermore, Circ_HECW2 regulated NEGR1 expression through functioning as a miR-30e-5p sponge. Moreover, miR-30e-5p overexpression repressed the EndoMT of LPS-treated HBMECs by targeting NEGR1. Collectively, our current study demonstrated that circ_HECW2 silencing suppressed LPS-triggered HBMEC EndoMT at least in part through the regulation of the miR-30e-5p/NEGR1 axis, illuminating a promising strategy for EndoMT inhibition.","Dong, Yuwei; Fan, Xiaoxuan; Wang, Zhe; Zhang, Ling; Guo, Shiwen",Brain research,425,5

We reviewed systematically the relevant published evidence on diagnostic criteria commonly in use for CECS to address 3 main questions: (1) Is there a standard diagnostic method available? (2) What ICP threshold criteria should be used for diagnosing CECS? (3) What are the criteria and options for surgical management? Finally, we made statements on the strength of each diagnostic criterion of ICP based on a rigorous standardized process. DATA SOURCES We searched for studies that investigated ICP measurements in diagnosing CECS in the leg of human subjects, using PubMed, Score, PEDRO, Cochrane, Scopus, SportDiscus, Web of Knowledge, and Google Scholar. Initial searches were performed using the phrase, ""chronic exertional compartment syndrome."" The phrase ""compartment syndrome"" was then combined, using Boolean connectors (""OR"" and ""AND"") with the words ""diagnosis,"" ""parameters,"" ""levels,"" ""localisation,"" or ""measurement."" Data extracted from each study included study design, number of subjects, number of controls, ICP instrument used, compartments measured, limb position during measurements, catheter position, exercise protocol, timing of measurements, mean resting compartment pressures, mean maximal compartment pressures, mean postexercise compartment pressures, diagnostic criteria used, and whether a reference diagnostic standard was used. The quality of studies was assessed based on the approach used by the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons in judging the quality of diagnostic studies, and recommendations were made regarding each ICP diagnostic criteria in the literature by taking into account the quality and quantity of the available studies proposing each criterion. MAIN RESULTS In the review, 32 studies were included. The studies varied in the ICP measurement techniques used; the most commonly measured compartment was the anterior muscle compartment, and the exercise protocol varied between running, walking, and ankle plantarflexion and dorsiflexion exercises. Preexercise, mean values ranged from 7.4 to 50.8 mm Hg for CECS patients, and 5.7 to 12 mm Hg in controls; measurements during exercise showed mean pressure readings ranging from 42 to 150 mm Hg in patients and 28 to 141 mm Hg in controls. No overlap between subjects and controls in mean ICP measurements was found at the 1-minute postexercise timing interval only showing values ranging from 34 to 55.4 mm Hg and 9 to 19 mm Hg in CECS patients and controls, respectively. The quality of the studies was generally not high, and we found the evidence for commonly used ICP criteria in diagnosing CECS to be weak. CONCLUSIONS Studies in which an independent, blinded comparison is made with a valid reference standard among consecutive patients are yet to be undertaken. There should also be an agreed ICP test protocol for diagnosing CECS because the variability here contributes to the large differences in ICP measurements and hence diagnostic thresholds between studies. Current ICP pressure criteria for CECS diagnosis are therefore unreliable, and emphasis should remain on good history. However, clinicians may consider measurements taken at 1 minute after exercise because mean levels at this timing interval only did not overlap between subjects and controls in the studies we analyzed. Levels above the highest reported value for controls here (27.5 mm Hg) along with a good history, should be regarded as highly suggestive of CECS. It is evident that to achieve an objective recommendation for ICP threshold there is a need to set up a multi-center study group to reach an agreed testing protocol and modify the preliminary recommendations we have made.","Aweid, Osama; Del Buono, Angelo; Malliaras, Peter; Iqbal, Hassan; Morrissey, Dylan; Maffulli, Nicola; Padhiar, Nat",Clinical journal of sport medicine : official journal of the Canadian Academy of Sport Medicine,425,7

At present, however, the necessity of executing pandemic influenza virus research under biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) high-containment conditions severely hampers timely characterization of such viruses. We tested heat, formalin, Triton X-100, and beta-propiolactone treatments for their potencies in inactivating human influenza A(H3N2) and avian A(H7N3) viruses, as well as seasonal and pandemic A(H1N1) virus isolates, while allowing the specimens to retain their virological and immunological properties. Successful heat inactivation coincided with the loss of hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) characteristics, and beta-propiolactone inactivation reduced the hemagglutination titer and NA activity of the human influenza virus 10-fold or more. Although Triton X-100 treatment resulted in inconsistent HA activity, the NA activities in culture supernatants were enhanced consistently. Nonetheless, formalin treatment permitted the best retention of HA and NA properties. Triton X-100 treatment proved to be the easiest-to-use influenza virus inactivation protocol for application in combination with phenotypic NA inhibitor susceptibility assays, while formalin treatment preserved B-cell and T-cell epitope antigenicity, allowing the detection of both humoral and cellular immune responses. In conclusion, we demonstrated successful influenza virus characterization using formalin- and Triton X-100-inactivated virus samples. Application of these inactivation protocols limits work under BSL-3 conditions to virus culture, thus enabling more timely determination of public health impact and development of protective measures when a new influenza virus, e.g., pandemic A(H1N1)v virus, is introduced in humans.","Jonges, Marcel; Liu, Wai Ming; van der Vries, Erhard; Jacobi, Ronald; Pronk, Inge; Boog, Claire; Koopmans, Marion; Meijer, Adam; Soethout, Ernst",Journal of clinical microbiology,425,1

DESIGN This was a secondary data analysis of the Optimizing Patient Transfers, Impacting Medical Quality, Improving Symptoms: Transforming Institutional Care project, in which clinical staff employed in the NH setting conducted medical, transitional, and palliative care quality improvement initiatives and gathered data related to resident transfers to the emergency department/hospital setting. R software and Microsoft Excel were used to characterize a subset of transfers prompted by behavioral concerns. SETTING NHs in central Indiana were utilized (N = 19). PARTICIPANTS This study included long-stay NH residents with behavioral concerns prompting transfer for acute emergency department/hospital evaluation (N = 355 transfers). MEASUREMENTS The measures used in this study were symptoms prompting transfer, resident demographics and baseline characteristics (Minimum Data Set 3.0 variables including scores for the Cognitive Function Scale, ADL Functional Status, behavioral symptoms directed toward others, and preexisting psychiatric diagnoses), on-site management (e.g., medical evaluation in person or by phone, testing, and interventions), avoidability rating, transfer disposition (inpatient vs emergency department only), and hospital discharge diagnoses. RESULTS Over half of the transfers, 56%, had a medical evaluation before transfer, and diagnostic testing was conducted before 31% of transfers. After transfer, 80% were admitted. The most common hospital discharge diagnoses were dementia-related behaviors (27%) and altered mental status (27%), followed by a number of medical diagnoses. CONCLUSION Most transfers for behavioral concerns merited hospital admission, and medical discharge diagnoses were common. There remain significant opportunities to improve pretransfer management of NH transfers for behavioral concerns.","Hathaway, Elizabeth E; Carnahan, Jennifer L; Unroe, Kathleen T; Stump, Timothy E; O'Kelly Phillips, Erin; Hickman, Susan E; Fowler, Nicole R; Sachs, Greg A; Bateman, Daniel R",Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,425,12

Socioeconomic status (SES) shapes people’s daily interaction with their social environment, and is known to impact various health outcomes. Using generative probabilistic modeling, we investigated health satisfaction and complementary indicators of socioeconomic lifestyle in the human social brain. In a population cohort of ~10,000 UK Biobank participants, our first analysis probed the relationship between health status and subjective social standing (i.e., financial satisfaction). We identified volume effects in participants unhappy with their health in regions of the higher associative cortex, especially the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and bilateral temporo-parietal junction (TPJ). Specifically, participants in poor subjective health showed deviations in dmPFC and TPJ volume as a function of financial satisfaction. The second analysis on health status and objective social standing (i.e., household income) revealed volume deviations in regions of the limbic system for individuals feeling unhealthy. In particular, low-SES participants dissatisfied with their health showed deviations in volume distributions in the amygdala and hippocampus bilaterally. Thus, our population-level evidence speaks to the possibility that health status and socioeconomic position have characteristic imprints in social brain differentiation.","Suryoputri, Nathania; Kiesow, Hannah; Bzdok, Danilo",bioRxiv,425,16

Using the Gene Ontology (GO), manual curation by experts has provided an important resource for studying gene function, especially within model organisms. Unprecedented expansion of the scientific literature and validation of the predicted proteins have increased both data value and the challenges of keeping pace. Capturing literature-based functional annotations is limited by the ability of biocurators to handle the massive and rapidly growing scientific literature. Within the community-oriented wiki framework for GO annotation called the Gene Ontology Normal Usage Tracking System (GONUTS), we describe an approach to expand biocuration through crowdsourcing with undergraduates. This multiplies the number of high-quality annotations in international databases, enriches our coverage of the literature on normal gene function, and pushes the field in new directions. From an intercollegiate competition judged by experienced biocurators, Community Assessment of Community Annotation with Ontologies (CACAO), we have contributed nearly 5000 literature-based annotations. Many of those annotations are to organisms not currently well-represented within GO. Over a ten-year history, our community contributors have spurred changes to the ontology not traditionally covered by professional biocurators. The CACAO principle of relying on community members to participate in and shape the future of biocuration in GO is a powerful and scalable model used to promote the scientific enterprise. It also provides undergraduate students with a unique and enriching introduction to critical reading of primary literature and acquisition of marketable skills. Significance Statement The primary scientific literature catalogs the results from publicly funded scientific research about gene function in human-readable format. Information captured from those studies in a widely adopted, machine-readable standard format comes in the form of Gene Ontology annotations about gene functions from all domains of life. Manual annotations based on inferences directly from the scientific literature, including the evidence used to make such inferences, represents the best return on investment by improving data accessibility across the biological sciences. To supplement professional curation, our CACAO project enabled annotation of the scientific literature by community annotators, in this case undergraduates, which resulted in contribution of thousands of validated entries to public resources. These annotations are now being used by scientists worldwide.","Ramsey, Jolene; McIntosh, Brenley; Renfro, Daniel; Aleksander, Suzanne A.; LaBonte, Sandra; Ross, Curtis; Zweifel, Adrienne E.; Liles, Nathan; Farrar, Shabnam; Gill, Jason J.; Erill, Ivan; Ades, Sarah; Berardini, Tanya Z.; Bennett, Jennifer A.; Brady, Siobhan; Britton, Robert; Carbon, Seth; Caruso, Steven M.; Clements, Dave; Dalia, Ritu; Defelice, Meredith; Doyle, Erin L.; Friedberg, Iddo; Gurney, Susan M.R.; Hughes, Lee; Johnson, Allison; Kowalski, Jason M.; Li, Donghui; Lovering, Ruth C.; Mans, Tamara L.; McCarthy, Fiona; Moore, Sean D.; Murphy, Rebecca; Paustian, Timothy D.; Perdue, Sarah; Peterson, Celeste N.; Prüß, Birgit M.; Saha, Margaret S.; Sheehy, Robert R.; Tansey, John T.; Temple, Louise; Thorman, Alexander William; Trevino, Saul; Vollmer, Amy Cheng; Walbot, Virginia; Willey, Joanne; Siegele, Deborah A.; Hu, James C.",bioRxiv,425,22

A missing element that has yet to be examined is the language contained within the bioRxiv preprint repository. We sought to compare and contrast linguistic features within bioRxiv preprints to published biomedical text as a whole as this is an excellent opportunity to examine how peer review changes these documents. The most prevalent features that changed appear to be associated with typesetting and mentions of supplementary sections or additional files. In addition to text comparison, we created document embeddings derived from a preprint-trained word2vec model. We found that these embeddings are able to parse out different scientific approaches and concepts, link unannotated preprint-peer reviewed article pairs, and identify journals that publish linguistically similar papers to a given preprint. We also used these embeddings to examine factors associated with the time elapsed between the posting of a first preprint and the appearance of a peer reviewed publication. We found that preprints with more versions posted and more textual changes took longer to publish. Lastly, we constructed a web application (https://greenelab.github.io/preprint-similarity-search/) that allows users to identify which journals and articles that are most linguistically similar to a bioRxiv or medRxiv preprint as well as observe where the preprint would be positioned within a published article landscape.","Nicholson, David N.; Rubinetti, Vincent; Hu, Dongbo; Thielk, Marvin; Hunter, Lawrence E.; Greene, Casey S.",bioRxiv,425,2

It is estimated that one billion people are at risk, with one million cases annually mainly affecting rural areas in Asia-Oceania. Relative to its burden, scrub typhus is understudied, and treatment recommendations vary with poor evidence base. These knowledge gaps could be addressed by establishing an individual participant-level data (IPD) platform, which would enable pooled, more detailed and statistically powered analyses to be conducted. This study aims to assess the characteristics of scrub typhus treatment studies and explore the feasibility and potential value of developing a scrub typhus IPD platform to address unanswered research questions. Methodology/Principal Findings: We conducted a systematic literature review looking for prospective scrub typhus clinical treatment studies published from 1998 to 2020. Six electronic databases (Ovid Embase, Ovid Medline, Ovid Global Health, Cochrane Library, Scopus, Global Index Medicus), ClinicalTrials.gov, and WHO ICTRP were searched. We extracted data on study design, treatment tested, patient characteristics, diagnostic methods, geographical location, outcome measures, and statistical methodology. Among 3,100 articles screened, 127 were included in the analysis. 12,079 participants from 12 countries were enrolled in the identified studies. ELISA, PCR, and eschar presence were the most commonly used diagnostic methods. Doxycycline, azithromycin, and chloramphenicol were the most commonly administered antibiotics. Mortality, complications, adverse events, and clinical response were assessed in most studies. There was substantial heterogeneity in the diagnostic methods used, treatment administered (including dosing and duration), and outcome assessed across studies. There were few interventional studies and limited data collected on specific groups such as children and pregnant women. Conclusions/Significance: There were a limited number of interventional trials, highlighting that scrub typhus remains a neglected disease. The heterogeneous nature of the available data reflects the absence of consensus in treatment and research methodologies and poses a significant barrier to aggregating information across available published data without access to the underlying IPD. There is likely to be a substantial amount of data available to address knowledge gaps. Therefore, there is value for an IPD platform that will facilitate pooling and harmonisation of currently scattered data and enable in-depth investigation of priority research questions that can, ultimately, inform clinical practice and improve health outcomes for scrub typhus patients.","Saraswati, K.; Maguire, B.

In 2020, the travel and gathering bans due to the global COVID-19 pandemic meant that these meetings were held ‘virtually’, primarily via videoconferencing. But can virtual meetings perform the same functions and deliver the same management outcomes as face-to-face meetings? This study is an initial investigation of the experiences, perceptions and attitudes of WCPO region government participants in a number of virtual regional fisheries meetings in 2020. Results indicate a strong preference for face-to-face regional meetings, with the perception that virtual meetings performed comparatively poorly at supporting a number of key meeting processes and outcomes. However, one-quarter to one-third of study participants consistently found no difference between format performance for many meeting processes and outcomes. Virtual formats were considered more appropriate for smaller and non-regional meetings, and allowed for greater staff attendance at meetings as well as cost and time savings for some, but not all, participants. Study participants believe that virtual regional meetings will be more common in the region in the future, despite nearly half indicating that virtual meeting are not a good fit for the region generally. Many of these experiences and perceptions are consistent with organisational behavior, communications media, and information systems literature. Some results appear unique to the region’s socially and culturally diverse Pacific island countries and territories, which are relative newcomers to the global information and communication technology ‘revolution’. A greater use of virtual regional fisheries meetings in the future requires meeting hosts and facilitators to carefully consider the potential impacts of virtual meetings on effective communication and inclusive participation in WCPO regional fisheries management and other governance outcomes.","Campbell, Brooke McIlgorm Alistair Voyer Michelle",Frontiers in Marine Science,425,1

Almost all of the existing work in this area has used perfectly accurate sampling assumptions, which is seldom true in practice. Here we introduce the first known theoretical approach to support estimation in the presence of sampling artifacts, where each sample is assumed to be observed through a Poisson channel that simultaneously captures repetitions and deletions. The proposed estimator is based on regularized weighted Chebyshev approximations, with weights governed by evaluations of Touchard (Bell) polynomials. The supports in the presence of sampling artifacts are calculated via discretized semi-infinite programming methods. The newly proposed estimation approach is tested on synthetic and textual data, as well as on GISAID data for the purpose of estimating the mutational diversity of genes in the SARS-Cov-2 viral genome.

A significant driving factor in the significant reduction in travel in the US was the declaration of varying state-, county-, and city-level stay-at-home orders with varying degrees of reduction. However, it is still not clear how significantly any one of those orders contributed to the reduction in travel. This article looks at continuous count data from the Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota, area to quantify the disruption in terms of reductions in traffic volume as well as the abnormality of the disruption to travel patterns. A nearly 50% reduction in total traffic volume is found, and regional trends both in reductions and the gradual recovery toward normal travel patterns are identified. Furthermore, key dates are identified that led to significant reductions in travel, and this disruptive event is compared with other significantly disruptive events in Minnesota for context. It is found that although the stay-at-home order was a significant milestone in the fight against COVID-19, traffic volumes had already reduced significantly before the order went into effect, and traffic volumes had recovered significantly before the order expired. These findings will be helpful in understand the impact of stay-at-home orders on future outbreaks of COVID-19 or other pandemics. (C) 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Liu, Z.

Purpose-built student accommodation (PBSA) has emerged as a new asset class in Australia, as demanded by international and domestic students. As of 25 October 2020, there were still approximately 400,000 onshore international students and 135,000 offshore students despite the COVID pandemic. Various universities remain optimistic about their returns to Australia. Active PBSA investors remain focussed on the longer-term fundamentals and return of the Australian student market. This study aims to examine the investment potential of the PBSA sector in Sydney. Design/methodology/approach: The triangulation method was used to confirm whether the literature findings on the high potential of PBSA investment apply to the context of the Sydney market. Qualitative expert interviews with two directors of major international real estate consulting firms, one private family trust investor and one director of a development company, were conducted in tandem with a qualitative multiple-case study of three major PBSAs via interviews with their building managers. These selected participants broadly covered the stakeholder settings across the industry. Findings: A positive and solid trend of demand and rental growth was confirmed by the expert interviews and the performance of PBSA cases in Sydney, as supported by the growing number of international students in the longer term. To enhance the rental growth, and hence total returns, self-contained studio-type accommodation with quality facilities and social support should be provided, and operators should consistently track the needs of students and provide them with a better living experience. Research limitations/implications: PBSA is a new asset class and there have been limited supply and sale transactions to enable detailed examination of the capital growth, so this research has focussed on rental growth. When the PBSA market becomes more mature, further research should be conducted to analyse the strength of this emerging investment’s capital growth and total returns. Practical implications: In the longer term, PBSA is a low-risk property investment with potentially high returns in Sydney. Institutional investors and real estate consultants can make informed decisions to build up the property portfolio. PBSA is capital-intensive and has low liquidity, so this type of investment is particularly suitable for institutional investors. Social implications: Universities should provide more suitable PBSA accommodations by themselves or partnerships with private developers. Planning authorities should include more PBSA residential uses in the land zoning plan. This is to provide more affordable accommodations to meet the demand of cost-sensitive students. Originality/value: This research confirms PBSA is a low-risk investment with potentially high returns within the context of the Sydney market. The findings will benefit the major stakeholders of PBSA in their investment decisions, including investors, developers and universities. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Lam, T. Y.

These events can no longer be dismissed as isolated cases, yet a lack of awareness and of basic research makes it impossible to say just how widespread this mode of transmission might be. Virus is transmitted within wastewater systems by the aerosolisation of wastewater and subsequent transport of bioaerosols on naturally occurring airflows within the piped network. Central to the debate around risk to building occupants from SARS-CoV-2 spread via wastewater plumbing systems is the question of infectivity of faeces, urine and associated aerosols. This paper presents an examination of the processes which underlie this mode of transmission, and the existing epidemiological evidence, as well as existing mitigation strategies;significant gaps in the state of the knowledge are also identified. It is hoped that this review will cultivate a wider awareness and understanding of this most overlooked of threats, and to facilitate the selection and adoption of appropriate mitigation strategies. Key gaps in the knowledge span the rate of generation of bioaerosols within the building drainage system, their composition and transport properties, and the viability and infectivity of virions and other pathogens which they carry.

In a very short period, the team developed procedures and executed a remote operations readiness test in parallel with the team's support for nominal operations. Continuing regular rover operations with an entirely remote team had not previously been considered feasible due to a variety of factors. These included both the human factors, such as multiple concurrent person-to-person interactions of the uplink planning team, as well as technical factors, such as reliance on powerful workstations dedicated to graphically intensive software tools used for planning.

MSL stood down the uplink planning originally scheduled for the next day while downlink continued monitoring the rover. Full operations then resumed per schedule with nearly the entire operations team teleworking on Friday, March 20, during which the team planned rover activities for three Martian days (sols). These activities included the successful drilling of the 'Edinburgh' rock target, a highly complex robotic arm contact science activity.

In this period the rover has completed four drilling campaigns and driven over 1160 meters towards its next major science target - a sulfate bearing geologic unit at the foot of Mount Sharp. Success has not been without its challenges. Many of these have been addressed while others will remain in some form until the team can safely return to JPL, which in turn is the largest challenge for the future. © 2021 IEEE.","Gildner, M.; Allbaugh, A.

We evaluated VC and carried out an interventional study to improve VC in cancer patients treated in 3 medical oncology departments in 3 hospitals of North-of- France. Methods: Using a standardized questionnaire, we assessed the VC in adult cancer patients receiving anticancer treatment in day hospital between 02 and 07 Dec. 2019. Then, in each hospital, we organized trainings with physicians to discuss the current vaccination guidelines (January 2020). Finally, to assess the impact of this intervention on Pneumococcal and Influenza VC, we have conducted a similar survey using the same questionnaire in March 2020. Since there were no specific guidelines on Diphtheria-Tetanus-Pertussis (DTP) VC and we did not expect an improvement, we have monitored DTP VC as internal control. Results: 272 patients have been enrolled in the 'before study' in the 3 hospitals, whereas 156 patients have been enrolled in the 'after study' in only 2 hospitals (the after-study was not feasible in 3rd hospital because of COVID-19 pandemic national containment). Predictors associated with DTP VC was age, with Pneumococcal VC was center and with Influenza VC were age, gender and tumor histology (adenocarcinoma vs others). Influenza VC was significantly improved after intervention (42.6 vs 55.1% with p = 0.016) especially in fragile patients, but Pneumococcal VC was not (11.8 vs 15.4% with p = 0.357). Conclusions: As expected, VC was very low in cancer patients, our figures are consistent with literature data. The impact of intervention (training of physicians) is limited without improvement of Pneumococcal VC. We presume that this increase in Influenza VC mainly reflects the overall result of national Influenza vaccination campaign.","Rivière, P.; Penel, N.; Faure, K.; Marie, G.; Panaget, S.",Journal of Clinical Oncology,425,29

Infection despite full vaccination (vaccine breakthrough) has been reported, but characteristics of those with vaccine breakthrough resulting in hospitalization and relative rates of hospitalization in unvaccinated and vaccinated persons are not well described, including during late June and July 2021 when the highly transmissible Delta variant predominated. Methods: From January 1-June 30, 2021, cases defined as adults aged [≥]18 years with laboratory-confirmed Severe Acute Respiratory Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection were identified from >250 acute care hospitals in the population-based COVID-19-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network (COVID-NET). Through chart review for sampled cases, we examine characteristics associated with vaccination breakthrough. From January 24-July 24, 2021, state immunization information system data linked to both >37,000 cases representative cases and the defined surveillance catchment area population were used to compare weekly hospitalization rates in vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. Unweighted case counts and weighted percentages are presented. Results: From January 1 - June 30, 2021, fully vaccinated cases increased from 1 (0.01%) to 321 (16.1%) per month. Among 4,732 sampled cases, fully vaccinated persons admitted with COVID-19 were older compared with unvaccinated persons (median age 73 years [Interquartile Range (IQR) 65-80] v. 59 years [IQR 48-70]; p<0.001), more likely to have 3 or more underlying medical conditions (201 (70.8%) v. 2,305 (56.1%), respectively; p<0.001) and be residents of long-term care facilities [37 (14.5%) v. 146 (5.5%), respectively; p<0.001]. From January 24 - July 24, 2021, cumulative hospitalization rates were 17 times higher in unvaccinated persons compared with vaccinated persons (423 cases per 100,000 population v. 26 per 100,000 population, respectively); rate ratios were 23, 22 and 13 for those aged 18-49, 50-64, and [≥]65 years respectively. For June 27 - July 24, hospitalization rates were [≥]10 times higher in unvaccinated persons compared with vaccinated persons for all age groups across all weeks. Conclusion: Population-based hospitalization rates show that unvaccinated adults aged [≥]18 years are 17 times more likely to be hospitalized compared with vaccinated adults. Rates are far higher in unvaccinated persons in all adult age groups, including during a period when the Delta variant was the predominant strain of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Vaccines continue to play a critical role in preventing serious COVID-19 illness and remain highly effective in preventing COVID-19 hospitalizations.","Havers, F. P.; Pham, H.; Taylor, C.

We aimed to report a series of patients with PCS attending a Post-COVID Unit and offer a comprehensive review on the topic. Adult patients with previously confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were systematically assessed through a semi-structured and validated survey. Total IgG, IgA and IgM serum antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 were evaluated by an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay. A systematic review of the literature and meta-analysis were conducted, following PRISMA guidelines. Univariate and multivariate methods were used to analyze data. Out of a total of 100 consecutive patients, 53 were women, the median of age was 49 years (IQR: 37.8 to 55.3), the median of post-COVID time after the first symptoms was 219 days (IQR: 143 to 258), and 65 patients were hospitalized during acute COVID-19. Musculoskeletal, digestive (i.e., diarrhea) and neurological symptoms including depression (by Zung scale) were the most frequent observed in PCS patients. A previous hospitalization was not associated with PCS manifestation. Arthralgia and diarrhea persisted in more than 40% of PCS patients. The median of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was 866.2 U/mL (IQR: 238.2 to 1681). Despite this variability, 98 patients were seropositive. Based on autonomic symptoms (by COMPASS 31) two clusters were obtained with different clinical characteristics. Levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were not different between clusters. A total of 40 articles (11,196 patients) were included in the meta-analysis. Fatigue/muscle weakness, dyspnea, pain and discomfort, anxiety/depression and impaired concentration were presented in more than 20% of patients reported. In conclusion, PCS is mainly characterized by musculoskeletal, pulmonary, digestive and neurological involvement including depression. PCS is independent of severity of acute illness and humoral response. Long-term antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection and a high inter-individual variability were confirmed. Future studies should evaluate the mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 may cause PCS and the best therapeutic options.","Anaya, J.-M.; Rojas, M.; Salinas, M.

This renders cellular network coverage from outdoor cell sites difficult. Indoor small cells and distributed antennas along train tracks are often considered as a solution, but the cost and the need for optical fiber backhaul are often prohibitive. To alleviate this issue, we describe an out-of-band repeater that converts a sub-6 GHz cell signal from a small cell installed at a cell tower to a mmWave frequency for the fronthaul to buildings or distributed antenna sites, where the signal is downconverted to the original frequency and emitted for example inside a building. This concept does not require fiber deployment, provides backward compatibility to equipment already in use, and additional indoor capacity is gained while outdoor networks are offloaded. The architecture and hardware prototype implementation are described, and measurements are reported to demonstrate the functionality and compatibility with commercial infrastructure and mobile terminals.","Schumacher, Adrian; Merz, Ruben; Burg, Andreas",,425,1

Methods: Using rapid laser planar imaging, we measured droplets while participants exhaled, said ""hello"" or ""snake"", sang a note or ""Happy Birthday"", with and without surgical face masks. We measured mean velocity magnitude (MVM), time averaged droplet number (TADN) and maximum droplet number (MDN). Multilevel regression models were used. Results: In 20 participants, sound intensity was 71 Decibels (dB) for speaking and 85 dB for singing (p<0.001). MVM was similar for all tasks with no clear hierarchy between vocal tasks or people and >85% reduction wearing face masks. Droplet transmission varied widely, particularly for singing. Masks decreased TADN by 99% (p<0.001) and MDN by 98% (p<0.001) for singing and 86-97% for other tasks. Masks reduced variance by up to 48%. When wearing a mask, neither singing task transmitted more droplets than exhaling. Conclusions: Wide variation exists for droplet production. This significantly reduced when wearing face masks. Singing during religious worship wearing a face mask appears as safe as exhaling or talking. This has implications for UK public health guidance during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Ho, K. M.

We reported characteristics of patients with COVID-19 during epidemic ongoing outbreak in Wuhan. Methods Data of COVID-19 patients with clinical outcome in a designated hospital in Wuhan, were retrospectively collected from electronic medical records. Characteristics were compared between patients who died or recovered, and between patients with different disease severity. Results By Feb 25, 2020, 403 patients were enrolled, 100 died and 303 recovered. Most of non-survivors tended to be males, old aged, or with chronic diseases. Duration from illness onset to admission was 9 (7-12) days. Patients with severe or critical illness had more days from onset to admission compared to those with ordinary illness. Lymphopenia, anemia, hypoproteinemia, and abnormal serum sodium were presented in 52.6%, 54.6%, 69.8%, and 21.8% cases, respectively. Patients who died or with severe/critical illness showed increased white blood cell and neutrophil count, serum total bilirubin, creatinine, hypersensitive troponin I, D-dimer, procalcitonin, and C-reactive protein, and decreased red blood cell, lymphocyte, platelet count, and serum albumin on admission compared to those who recovered or with ordinary illness. Complications of acute organ injury and secondary infection were common in patients with COVID-19, especially in non-survivors. Conclusions Multiple homeostasis disturbances were common in patients with severe or critical illness at admission. Early support should be provided, especially for old men with chronic disease, which is vital to control disease progression and reduce mortality of COVID-19 during epidemic ongoing outbreak.","Luo, Xiaomin; Xia, Hongxia; Yang, Weize; Wang, Benchao; Guo, Tangxi; Xiong, Jun; Jiang, Zongping; Liu, Yu; Yan, Xiaojie; Zhou, Wei; Ye, Lu; Zhang, Bicheng",,425,25

Despite having no direct competencies in housing policy, European Union norms and policies shape housing conditions in significant ways. The greater level of public spending on housing renovation enabled by the 2021?2027 multiannual financial framework and NextGeneration European Union funding signals a welcome shift away from austerity. However, investment alone is not enough to advance the right to housing and may even reinforce existing inequalities. Plans like the Renovation Wave and the Affordable Housing Initiative must strive not only for climate neutrality but also for housing cost and tenure neutrality.

The arrival of the Zika and chikungunya viruses to South America increased the complexity of transmission and morbidity caused by these viruses co-circulating in the same vector mosquito species. Here we present an integrated analysis of the reported arbovirus cases between 2007 and 2017 and local climate and socio-economic profiles of three distinct Colombian municipalities (Bello, Cucuta and Moniquira). These locations were confirmed as three different ecosystems given their contrasted geographic, climatic and socio-economic profiles. Correlational analyses were conducted with both generalised linear models and generalised additive models for the geographical data. Average temperature and wind speed were strongly correlated with disease incidence. The transmission of Zika during the 2016 epidemic appeared to decrease circulation of dengue in Cucuta, an area of sustained high incidence of dengue. Socio-economic factors such as barriers to health and childhood services, inadequate sanitation and poor water supply suggested an unfavourable impact on the transmission of dengue, Zika and chikungunya in all three ecosystems. Socio-demographic influencers were also discussed including the influx of people to Cucuta, fleeing political and economic instability from neighbouring Venezuela. Aedes aegypti is expanding its range and increasing the global threat of these diseases. It is therefore vital that we learn from the epidemiology of these arboviruses and translate it into an actionable knowledge base. This is even more acute given the recent historical high of dengue cases in the Americas in 2019, preceding the COVID-19 pandemic, which is itself hampering mosquito control efforts.","Morgan, J.; Strode, C.; Salcedo-Sora, J.

The current study examines the relationship between learners' satisfaction on distance learning and factors (online learning self-efficacy, anxiety, fear of COVID-19) that impact students' remote learning experience among undergraduate engineering students in Jordanian public and private universities. Data was collected via an online survey measuring students' baseline of distance learning satisfaction, online learning self-efficacy, anxiety, and fear of COVID-19 which was distributed between June to August 2020. The participants in this study were 505 undergraduate engineering students (353 males, 152 females) who were mostly Jordanian (92.6%) with an average age of 21 (SD = 1.86). There were 298 participants from public universities (59%) and 207 from private universities (41%). Findings reported a significant gap between public and private universities students' distance learning satisfaction, online learning self-efficacy, and anxiety level while the students' scores on fear of COVID-19 was insignificant. Students in private universities were also reported to have higher baseline rates for all the constructs involved in this study. Furthermore, the online learning self-efficacy scores significantly predicted the distance learning satisfaction level among undergraduate engineering students when other constructs were treated as a constant. The findings of this study offer important implications for instructors in considering self-efficacy skills when working with undergraduate students.

There exists a seasonal cycle in the correlation between AOD, Chlorophyll–a (Chl–a) and NPP in agreement with the seasonal transport of aerosols and dust into these oceanic regions. In Arabian Sea (AS), the highest Chl–a (0.58 mg/m3), NPP (696.57 mg/C/m2/day) and AOD (0.39) are observed in JJAS (June, July, August and September) and In BoB, maximum Chl–a (0.48 mg/m3) and NPP (486.39 mg/C/m2/day) are found in JJAS and AOD (0.27) in MAM (March, April and May). The interannual variability of Chl–a and NPP with wind speed and Sea Surface Temperature (SST) is also examined, where the former has a positive and the latter has a negative feedback to NPP. The interannual variability of NPP reveals a decreasing trend in NPP, which is interlinked with the increasing trend in SST and AOD. The analysis of wind, SST, Chl–a, and AOD for the pre-lockdown, lockdown, and post lockdown periods of 2020 is used to understand the impact of COVID-19 lockdown. The assessment shows the reduction in AOD, decreased wind speeds, increased SST and reduced NPP during the lockdown period as compared to the pre-lockdown, post-lockdown and climatology. The year 2018 is also analysed separately during these periods to understand the influence of lockdown in NIO. This analysis will help to understand the impact of aerosols on the ocean biogeochemistry, nutrient cycles in the ocean biogeochemical models, and to study the effects of climate change on ocean ecosystems.","Sunanda, N.; Kuttippurath, J.; Peter, R.; Chakraborty, Kunal Chakraborty A.",Frontiers in Marine Science,425,16

Methods: To eliminate seasonal differences, the files of 3320 patients who underwent the cesarean section between 2019-2020 March-September were examined. The patients were divided into two groups as those who had cesarean section between March-September 2019 before the pandemic (Group I, n:1941) and those who had cesarean section after the pandemic (March-September 2020) (Group II, n:1379). The demographic information of the patients, whether there was an emergency/elective surgery, anesthesia methods and duration of hospitalization were recorded from the hospital database. Results: ASA scores (p=0.049) and duration of hospitalization (p&lt;0.001) were higher in Group I. Spinal anaesthesia preference was higher in both groups compared to general anaesthesia (p&lt;0.001). Spinal anaesthesia preference was higher than general anaesthesia in emergency and elective operations in both groups (p&lt;0.001). It was found that the PCR results of three emergency cesarean sections under spinal anesthesia were postoperatively positive. The number of patients operated on in all shifts was higher in Group I (p&lt;0.001).

Monitoring COVID-19 infection risk among health care workers (HCWs) is a public health priority. We examined the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 among HCWs following the fall infection surge in Minnesota, and before and after COVID-19 vaccination. Additionally, we assessed demographic and occupational risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods. We conducted two rounds of seroprevalence testing among a cohort of HCWs: samples in round 1 were collected from 11/22/20 - 02/21/21 and in round 2 from 12/18/20 - 02/15/21. Demographic and occupational exposures assessed with logistic regression were age, sex, healthcare role and setting, and number of children in the household. The primary outcome was SARS-CoV-2 IgG seropositivity. A secondary outcome, SARS-CoV-2 infection, included both seropositivity and self-reported SARS-CoV-2 test positivity. Results. In total, 459 HCWs were tested. 43/454 (9.47%) had a seropositive sample 1 and 75/423 (17.7%) had a seropositive sample 2. By time of sample 2 collection, 54% of participants had received at least one vaccine dose and seroprevalence was 13% among unvaccinated individuals.

Managing and monitoring COVID-19 patients is still a challenging issue for advanced technologies. The first and foremost critical issue in COVID-19 is to diagnose it timely and cut off the chain of transmission by isolating the susceptible and patients. COVID-19 spreads through close interaction and contact with an infected person. It has affected the entire world, and every country is facing the challenges of having adequate medical facilities along with the availability of medical staff in rural and urban areas that have a high number of patients due to the pandemic. Due to the invasive method of treatment, SARS-COVID is spreading swiftly. In this paper, we propose an intelligent health monitoring framework using wearable Internet of Things (IoT) and Geo-fencing for COVID-19 susceptible and patient monitoring, and isolation and quarantine management to control the pandemic. The proposed system consists of four layers, and each layer has different functionality: a wearable sensors layer, IoT gateway layer, cloud server layer, and client application layer for visualization and analysis. The wearable sensors layer consists of wearable biomedical and GPS sensors for physiological parameters, and GPS and Wi-Fi Received Signal Strength Indicator acquisition for health monitoring and user Geo-fencing. The IoT gateway layer provides a Bluetooth and Wi-Fi based wireless body area network and IoT environment for data transmission anytime and anywhere. Cloud servers use Raspberry Pi and ThingSpeak cloud for data analysis and web-based application layers for remote monitoring based on user consent. The susceptible and patient conditions, real-time sensor’s data, and Geo-fencing enables minimizing the spread through close interaction. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed framework.","Ullah, Farman Haq Hassan Ul Khan Jebran Safeer Arslan Ali Asif Usman Lee Sungchang",Electronics,425,28

Quality control marker (Q-marker) is always used to confirm the primary effects of herbs or TCM. Thus, the characterization of the metabolism features and subsequently induced effects are essential to reveal the functional consequences. In this work, a strategy by integrating metabolite profiling of a Q-marker and network pharmacology was proposed and applied to explore the potential function of herbs, and prim-O-glucosylcimifugin, the Q-marker of Radix Saposhnikoviae, was used as an example. As a result, 35 metabolites were characterized in rats' plasma, urine, feces, heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, and brain. Among them, M13/M17/M20/M23/M24/M28 were the primary metabolites, and 23 metabolites were reported for the first time. It was found that major metabolic pathways of prim-O-glucosylcimifugin were hydroxylation, dehydrogenation, hydrogenation and glucuronidation. In addition to the above metabolic reactions, methylation, hydrogenation, glycosylation, isomerization, sulfation, and other S-conjunctions were found in prim-O-glucosylcimifugin for the first time. Meanwhile, targets of prim-O-glucosylcimifugin and its major metabolites targeted additional 125 targets with functions of MAPK signaling pathway, proteoglycans in cancer, pathways in cancer, bladder cancer, colorectal cancer, serotonergic synapse and natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Among them, the depression of inflammation by MAPK signaling pathway might be the core mechanism for prim-O-glucosylcimifugin to treat respiratory tract infections. The above results provided vital information for understanding the metabolism and functional mechanism of prim-O-glucosylcimifugin in the treatment of respiratory tract infections, and a new insight for revealing the pharmacological mechanism of the complex system was also provided.","Zhang, F.

Nitrate ingestion has also been shown to reduce blood pressure in some, but not all, studies of older individuals. However, the optimal dose for eliciting these beneficial effects is unknown. Methods: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study was performed to determine the effects of ingesting 3.3 mL/kg of concentrated beetroot juice (BRJ) containing 0, 200, or 400 umol/kg of nitrate in nine healthy older subjects (one man, eight women; mean age 70+/-1 y). Maximal knee extensor power (Pmax) and speed (Vmax) were measured 2 h after BRJ ingestion using isokinetic dynamometry. Blood pressure was monitored periodically throughout each study. Results: Pmax (in W/kg) was higher (P<0.05) after the low dose (3.9+/-0.4) compared to the placebo (3.7+/-0.4) or high dose (3.7+/-0.4). Vmax (in rad/s) also tended higher (P=0.08) in the low (11.9+/-0.7) compared to the placebo (10.8+/-0.8) or high dose (11.20+/-.8) trials. Eight out of nine subjects achieved a higher Pmax and Vmax after the lower vs. the higher dose. These dose-related changes in muscle contractility paralleled changes in nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability, as reflected by changes in breath NO and plasma 3 nitrotyrosine levels. No significant changes were found in systolic, diastolic, or mean arterial pressure. Conclusions: Varying doses of dietary nitrate have differential effects on muscle function and blood pressure in older individuals. A moderate dose of nitrate increases muscle speed and power, but these improvements are lost at a higher dose. Blood pressure, on the other hand, is not reduced even with a higher dose.","Gallardo, E. J.; Gray, D. A.; Hoffman, R. L.; Yates, B. A.; Moorthi, R. N.; Coggan, A. R.",,425,20

Spectral data between 270 and 329 nm are used for the retrieval. A recalibration of the measured radiances is done using ozone profiles from MLS/Aura. Studies with synthetic spectra show that individual profiles in the stratosphere can be retrieved with an uncertainty of about 10 %. In the troposphere, the retrieval errors are larger depending on the a priori profile used. The vertical resolution above 18 km is about 6–10 km, and it degrades to 15–25 km below. The vertical resolution in the troposphere is strongly dependent on the solar zenith angle (SZA). The ozone profiles retrieved from TROPOMI with the TOPAS algorithm were validated using data from ozonesondes and stratospheric ozone lidars. Above 18 km, the comparison with sondes shows excellent agreement within less than ±5 % for all latitudes. The standard deviation of mean differences is about 10 %. Below 18 km, the relative mean deviation in the tropics and northern latitudes is still quite good, remaining within ±20 %. At southern latitudes, larger differences of up to +40 % occur between 10 and 15 km. The standard deviation is about 50 % between 7–18 km and about 25 % below 7 km. The validation of stratospheric ozone profiles with ground-based lidar measurements also shows very good agreement. The relative mean deviation is below ±5 % between 18–45 km, with a standard deviation of 10 %. TOPAS retrieval results for 1 d of TROPOMI observations were compared to ozone profiles from the Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) on the Aura satellite and the Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite Limb Profiler (OMPS-LP).

Outbreaks of the emerging viruses chikungunya and Zika in 2014 and 2016, respectively, demonstrated the rapidity with which these viruses can spread between islands. At the same time, the number of reported dengue fever cases, caused by the endemic dengue virus, has steadily climbed over the past decade, and a large dengue outbreak that began sweeping through this region in 2019 continues in 2020. Sustainable disease and mosquito control measures are urgently needed to quell virus transmission in the long term and prevent future outbreaks from occurring. To improve upon current surveillance methods, we analyzed temporal and spatial patterns of chikungunya, Zika, and dengue outbreaks reported in the Dominican Republic between 2012 and 2018. The viruses that caused these outbreaks are transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, which are sensitive to seasonal climatological variability. In this study, we evaluated whether climate and the spatio-temporal dynamics of past dengue outbreaks could inform when and where future emerging disease outbreaks might occur. We found that the temporal and spatial distribution of emerging disease outbreaks did not conform to those of seasonal dengue outbreaks. Rather, the former occurred when climatological conditions were suboptimal for Aedes activity. Provincial dengue attack rates did not correspond to those of emerging diseases. Our study also provides evidence for under-reporting of dengue cases, especially following the 2016 Zika outbreak. We advocate for the implementation of a sustainable and long-term surveillance system to monitor the spread of known mosquito-borne viruses and to identify emerging threats before they cause outbreaks. Specifically, we recommend the use of febrile illness incidence, case fatality rates, and serosurveys during inter-outbreak periods to better understand rates of transmission and asymptomatic infection.","Petrone, M.

We projected the impact of COVID-19 on future breast cancer mortality.Methods: Three established Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network (CISNET) models projected the impact of pandemic-related care disruptions on breast cancer mortality between 2020 and 2030 vs. prepandemic care patterns. Based on Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium data, we modeled reductions in mammography screening utilization, delays in symptomatic cancer diagnosis, and reduced use of chemotherapy for women with early-stage disease for the first six months of the pandemic with return to pre-pandemic patterns after that time. Sensitivity analyses were performed to determine the effect of key model parameters, including the duration of the pandemic impact. Results: By 2030, the models project 1,297 (model range: 1,054-1,900) cumulative excess deaths related to reduced screening;1,325 (range: 266-2,628) deaths from delayed diagnosis of symptomatic women, and 207 (range: 146-301) deaths from reduced chemotherapy use for early-stage cancer. Overall, the models predict 2,487 (range 1,713- 4,875) excess deaths, representing a 0.56% (range: 0.36%-0.99%) cumulative increase over deaths that would be expected by 2030 in the absence of the pandemic's disruptions. Sensitivity analyses indicated that the impact on mortality would approximately double if the disruptions lasted for a 12-month period. Conclusions: The impact of the initial pandemicrelated disruptions in breast cancer care will have a small long-term cumulative impact on breast cancer mortality. The impact of the initial pandemic-related disruptions on breast cancer mortality will largely be mitigated by the rapid return to usual care. As the pandemic continues it will be important to monitor trends in care and reassess the mortality impact. (Table Presented).","Alagoz, O.; Lowry, K. P.; Kurian, A. W.; Mandelblatt, J. S.; Ergun, M.

Training data is in particular scarce for segmenting infection regions of CT images of COVID-19 patients. Attention models help gather contextual information within deep networks and benefit semantic segmentation tasks. The recent criss-cross-attention module aims to approximate global self-attention while remaining memory and time efficient by separating horizontal and vertical self-similarity computations. However, capturing attention from all non-local locations can adversely impact the accuracy of semantic segmentation networks. We propose a new Dynamic Deformable Attention Network (DDANet) that enables a more accurate contextual information computation in a similarly efficient way. Our novel technique is based on a deformable criss-cross attention block that learns both attention coefficients and attention offsets in a continuous way. A deep segmentation network (in our case a U-Net ) that employs this attention mechanism is able to capture attention from pertinent non-local locations and also improves the performance on semantic segmentation tasks compared to criss-cross attention within a U-Net on a challenging COVID-19 lesion segmentation task. Our validation experiments show that the performance gain of the recursively applied dynamic deformable attention blocks comes from their ability to capture dynamic and precise (wider) attention context. Our DDANet achieves Dice scores of 73.4% and 61.3% for Ground-Glass-Opacity and Consolidation lesions for COVID-19 segmentation and improves the accuracy by 4.9% points compared to a baseline U-Net.","Rajamani, K.

However, without the consideration of the needs of specific populations, public health interventions can exacerbate health inequities. Purpose: The purpose of this rapid review was to determine if and how health inequities were included in the design of contact tracing interventions in epidemic settings. Method: We conducted a search of the electronic databases MEDLINE and Web of Science. Our inclusion criteria included articles that: (i) described the design of contact tracing interventions, (ii) have been published between 2013 and 2020 in English, French, Spanish, Chinese, or Portuguese, (iii) and included at least 50% of empiricism, according to the Automated Classifier of Texts on Scientific Studies (ATCER) tool. We relied on various tools to extract data. Result: Following the titles and abstracts screening of 230 articles, 39 articles met the inclusion criteria. Only seven references were retained after full text review. None of the selected studies considered health inequities in the design of contact tracing interventions. Conclusion: The use of tools/concepts for incorporating health inequities, such as the REFLEX-ISS tool, and 'proportionate universalism' when designing contact tracing interventions, would enable practitioners, decision makers, and researchers to better consider health inequities.","Mathevet, I.; Ost, K.; Traverson, L.; Ridde, V.; Zinszer, K.",,425,15

Occupational exposure to Coccidioides, the causative fungi, typically is associated with soil-disrupting activities. The physicians noted that both workers were cast or crew members filming a television series episode, and the site of possible exposure was an outdoor set in Ventura County, California. On the basis of their job titles, neither would have been expected to have been engaged in soil-disrupting activities. Los Angeles County Department of Public Health (LACDPH) conducted an outbreak investigation by using CDPH-provided occupational surveillance records, traditional infectious disease surveillance, and social media searches. This report describes the results of that investigation, which identified a total of five laboratory-confirmed and five probable cases linked to this filming event. The employer and site manager were interviewed. The site manager stated that they would no longer allow soil-disruptive work at the site and would incorporate information about the potential risk for Coccidioides exposure onsite into work contracts. Public health professionals, clinicians, and the television and film industry should be aware that employees working outdoors in areas where Coccidioides is endemic (e.g., central and southern California), even those not engaged in soil-disruptive work, might be at risk for coccidioidomycosis.","Wilken, Jason A; Marquez, Patricia; Terashita, Dawn; McNary, Jennifer; Windham, Gayle; Materna, Barbara",MMWR.

METHODS Animals at live animal market were sampled for rectal and throat swabs in triplicate. A single step realtime reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) diagnostic kit was performed for screening SARS-CoV like virus, the manual nested RT- PCR and DNA sequencing were performed for confirmation. Only specimens which tested positive for both of the N and P genes by nested RT-PCR were scored as positive. RESULTS In 31 animals sampled in January 5 2004 before culling of wild animals at Guangdong Province, including 20 cats (Felis catus), 5 red fox (Vulpes vulpes) and 6 Lesser rice field rats (Rattus losea), 8 (25.8%) animals were tested positive for SARS-CoV like virus by RT-PCR methods, of which 4 cats, 3 red fox and one Lesser rice field rats were included. However, two weeks after culling of animals and disinfection of the market were implemented, in 119 animals sampled in January 20 2004, including 6 rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus), 13 cats, 46 red jungle fowl (Gallus gallus), 13 spotbill duck (Anas platyrhynchos), 10 greylag goose (Anser anser), 31 Chinese francolin (Franclinus pintadeanus), only rectal swab from one greylag goose was tested positive for SARS-CoV like virus. Furthermore, in 102 animals that including 14 greylag gooses, 3 cats, 5 rabbits, 9 spotbill duck (Anaspoecilorhyncha), 2 Chinese francolin (Franclinus pintadeanus), 8 common pheasant (Phasianus colchicus), 6 pigeons, 9 Chinese muntjac (Muntiacus reevesi), 19 wild boar (Sus scrofa), 16 Lesser rice field rats, 5 dogs, 1 mink (Mustela vison), 3 goats, 2 green peafowl (Pavo muticus) sampled in April, May, June, July, August and November, only rectal swab from one pig was tested positive. However, of 12 and 10 palm civets sampled in November and December including five of which had been at the live animals market for 2 days, none of them was tested positive. CONCLUSION This findings revealed that animals being sampled in April, May, June, July, August and November of 2004, only one rectal swab from a pig was tested positive as SARS-CoV like virus, much lower than the results from the previous year, suggesting that the possibility of re-emerging of human infection from animal origins is low for the winter of 2004-2005.","Wang, Ming; Jing, Huai-qi; Xu, Hui-fang; Jiang, Xiu-gao; Kan, Biao; Liu, Qi-yong; Wan, Kang-lin; Cui, Bu-yun; Zheng, Han; Cui, Zhi-gang; Yan, Mei-ying; Liang, Wei-li; Wang, Hong-xia; Qi, Xiao-bao; Li, Zhen-jun; Li, Ma-chao; Chen, Kai; Zhang, En-min; Zhang, Shou-yin; Hai, Rong; Yu, Dong-zheng; Xu, Jian-guo",Zhonghua liu xing bing xue za zhi = Zhonghua liuxingbingxue zazhi,425,19

However, most of these cleavage sites have not been experimentally confirmed and the proteins have not been identified in vitro or in virus-infected cells. We used specific antibodies to identify and characterize a 22-kDa protein (p1a-22) expressed from gene 1 in MHV A59-infected DBT cells. Processing of p1a-22 from the polyprotein began immediately after translation, but some processing continued for several hours. Amino-terminal sequencing of p1a-22 purified from MHV-infected cells showed that it was cleaved at a putative 3CLpro cleavage site, Gln_Ser4014 (where the underscore indicates the site of cleavage), that is located between the 3CLpro domain and the end of open reading frame (ORF) 1a. Subclones of this region of gene 1 were used to express polypeptides in vitro that contained one or more 3CLpro cleavage sites, and cleavage of these substrates by recombinant 3CLpro in vitro confirmed that amino-terminal cleavage of p1a-22 occurred at Gln_Ser4014. We demonstrated that the carboxy-terminal cleavage of the p1a-22 protein occurred at Gln_Asn4208, a sequence that had not been predicted as a site for cleavage by MHV 3CLpro. Our results demonstrate the usefulness of recombinant MHV 3CLpro in identifying and confirming cleavage sites within the gene 1 polyprotein. Based on our results, we predict that at least seven mature proteins are processed from the ORF 1a polyprotein by 3CLpro and suggest that additional noncanonical cleavage sites may be used by 3CLpro during processing of the gene 1 polyprotein.","Lu, X T; Sims, A C; Denison, M R",Journal of virology,425,1

In ALS, a selective and relentless degeneration of both upper and lower motor neurons occurs, culminating in mortality typically within 5 years of symptom onset. However, survival rates vary among individual patients and can be from a few months to >10 years from diagnosis. Inadequacies in disease detection and treatment, along with a lack of diagnostic and prognostic tools, have prompted many to turn to proteomics-based biomarker discovery efforts. Proteomics refers to the study of the proteins expressed by a genome at a particular time, and the proteome can respond to and reflect the status of an organism, including health and disease states. Although an emerging field, proteomic applications promise to uncover biomarkers critical for differentiating patients with ALS and other MNDs from healthy individuals and from patients affected by other diseases. Ideally, these studies will also provide mechanistic information to facilitate identification of new drug targets for subsequent therapeutic development. In addition to proper experimental design, standard operating procedures for sample acquisition, preprocessing, and storage must be developed. Biological samples typically analyzed in proteomic studies of neurologic diseases include both plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Recent studies have identified individual proteins and/or protein panels from blood plasma and CSF that represent putative biomarkers for ALS, although many of these proteins are not unique to this disease. Continued investigations are required to validate these initial findings and to further pursue the role of these proteins as diagnostic biomarkers or surrogate markers of disease progression. Protein biomarkers specific to ALS will additionally function to evaluate drug efficacy in clinical trials and to identify novel targets for drug design. It is hoped that proteomic technologies will soon integrate the basic biology of ALS with mechanistic disease information to achieve success in the clinical setting.","Kolarcik, Christi; Bowser, Robert",Molecular diagnosis & therapy,425,1

Bali as a tourism destinations and the TS as major incomes of its population is greatly impacted, causing many to be jobless among those involved in TS. This situation may give psychological impact causing anxiety disorder (AD). OBJECTIVE To investigate the association between severe anxiety disorder and other factors with COVID-19 disease severity. METHODS This was cross-sectional study during March - November 2020. The diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 was done by using RT-PCR from throat swabs, based on WHO's interim guidelines. AD was measured using self-reporting Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7). All participants underwent, history taking, physical examinations, blood routine examination and chest radiography. Association between severe AD and other factors with COVID-19 disease severity were analyzed. Chi-square test (bivariate) and Logistic regression (multivariate) with the precision value of 95% was done and p-value less than 5% was considered significant. RESULTS Positive rate of Covid-19 patients was 43% (292 / 678). Among those 292 with Covid-19, 74 (25.3%) participants had severe disease. Multivariate analysis showed severe anxiety (OR 696.11; 95%CI: 78.54 to 6169.98; p<0.001), hypertension (OR 37.02; 95%CI: 4.49 to 305.39; p=0.001) and neutrophyl lymphocyte ratio (NLR) less than 2.89 (OR 0.15; 95%CI: 0.04 to 0.62; p=0.009).

Following MHV-3 infection, macrophages isolated from MHV-3-susceptible and -semisusceptible inbred strains of mice express increased procoagulant activity (PCA), whereas macrophages from resistant strains express no increase in PCA over basal levels. The PCA induced by MHV-3 is a prothrombinase, encoded by the gene Fgl-2, which encodes a fibrinogen-like protein (musfiblp). In this study, MHV-3-resistant A/J mice treated with methylprednisolone prior to infection with MHV-3 developed elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase in serum and died within 10 days of infection, with histological findings of fulminant hepatitis. In vitro, macrophages isolated from A/J mice and pretreated with methylprednisolone produced a marked increase in functional PCA following infection with MHV-3. The PCA was shown to be a prothrombinase by its ability to cleave 125I-prothrombin. Northern blot analysis of RNA transcripts from these macrophages demonstrated increased transcription of the Fgl-2 gene relative to that in macrophages which had not been pretreated with methylprednisolone prior to MHV-3 infection. Methylprednisolone pretreatment of MHV-3-infected macrophages stabilized the Fgl-2 mRNA. Thus, loss of resistance to MHV-3 secondary to methylprednisolone therapy is associated with increased transcription and stability of Fgl-2 mRNA resulting in expression of the Fgl-2 gene product, musfiblp. These results provide further insight into mechanisms of PCA regulation in response to MHV-3 infection in inbred strains of mice.","Fingerote, R J; Abecassis, M; Phillips, M J; Rao, Y S; Cole, E H; Leibowitz, J; Levy, G A",Journal of virology,425,1

Experiences of systemic racism affect the mental health of Canadian young people in multiple complex and intersecting ways including access to care, experience of mental health services, and outcomes of care.

We suggest that a blueprint for improved services for racialized young people in Canada would include: Development of a funded and sustainable research agenda responsive to community expertise, development and implementation of a Canadian Child and Adolescent task force focused on educational strategies on racism and service provision at both the postgraduate and continuing professional development (CPD) levels, and consideration of clinical parameters that improve access to, and experience of, care for Canadian racialized youth.","Gajaria, Amy; Guzder, Jaswant; Rasasingham, Raj",Journal of the Canadian Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry = Journal de l'Academie canadienne de psychiatrie de l'enfant et de l'adolescent,425,24

Currently, no effective antiviral agents exist against this type of virus. A cell-based assay, with SARS virus and Vero E6 cells, was developed to screen existing drugs, natural products, and synthetic compounds to identify effective anti-SARS agents. Of >10,000 agents tested, approximately 50 compounds were found active at 10 microM; among these compounds, two are existing drugs (Reserpine 13 and Aescin 5) and several are in clinical development. These 50 active compounds were tested again, and compounds 2-6, 10, and 13 showed active at 3 microM. The 50% inhibitory concentrations for the inhibition of viral replication (EC(50)) and host growth (CC(50)) were then measured and the selectivity index (SI = CC(50)/EC(50)) was determined. The EC(50), based on ELISA, and SI for Reserpine, Aescim, and Valinomycin are 3.4 microM (SI = 7.3), 6.0 microM (SI = 2.5), and 0.85 microM (SI = 80), respectively. Additional studies were carried out to further understand the mode of action of some active compounds, including ELISA, Western blot analysis, immunofluorescence and flow cytometry assays, and inhibition against the 3CL protease and viral entry. Of particular interest are the two anti-HIV agents, one as an entry blocker and the other as a 3CL protease inhibitor (K(i) = 0.6 microM).","Wu, Chung-Yi; Jan, Jia-Tsrong; Ma, Shiou-Hwa; Kuo, Chih-Jung; Juan, Hsueh-Fen; Cheng, Yih-Shyun E; Hsu, Hsien-Hua; Huang, Hsuan-Cheng; Wu, Douglass; Brik, Ashraf; Liang, Fu-Sen; Liu, Rai-Shung; Fang, Jim-Min; Chen, Shui-Tein; Liang, Po-Huang; Wong, Chi-Huey",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,425,22

Yet, in spite of this therapy, patients with vs. patients without diabetes have an adverse disease course. In fact, glucose homoeostasis has influenced the outcomes of diabetes patients with infectious diseases. Of the 475 Covid-19-positive patients admitted to infectious disease departments (University of Bologna, University Vanvitelli of Napoli, San Sebastiano Caserta Hospital) in Italy since 1 March 2020, 31 (39.7%) hyperglycaemic and 47 (60.3%) normoglycaemic patients (blood glucose levels &#8805;140mg/dL) were retrospectively evaluated at admission and during their hospital stay. Of note, 20 (64%) hyperglycaemic and 11 (23.4%) normoglycaemic patients had diabetes (P<0.01). At admission, hyperglycaemic vs. normoglycaemic patients had fivefold higher IL-6 levels, which persisted even after TCZ administration (P<0.05). Intriguingly, in a risk-adjusted Cox regression analysis, TCZ in hyperglycaemic patients failed to attenuate risk of severe outcomes as it did in normoglycaemic patients (P<0.009). Also, in hyperglycaemic patients, higher IL-6 plasma levels reduced the effects of TCZ, while adding IL-6 levels to the Cox regression model led to loss of significance (P<0.07) of its effects. Moreover, there was evidence that optimal Covid-19 infection management with TCZ is not achieved during hyperglycaemia in both diabetic and non-diabetic patients. These data may be of interest to currently ongoing clinical trials of TCZ effects in Covid-19 patients and of optimal control of glycaemia in this patient subset.","Marfella, R; Paolisso, P; Sardu, C; Bergamaschi, L; D039,; Angelo, E C; Barbieri, M; Rizzo, M R; Messina, V; Maggi, P; Coppola, N; Pizzi, C; Biffi, M; Viale, P; Galié, N; Paolisso, G",Diabetes metab,425,29

A rapid, simple, precise, accurate, and isocratic high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method has been developed for routine quality control of favipiravir in pharmaceutical formulations. Separation was carried out by C18 column. The mobile phase was a mixture of 50 mM potassium dihydrogen phosphate (pH 2.3) and acetonitrile (90:10, v/v) at a flow rate of 1 mL min(-1). The ultraviolet (UV) detection and column temperature were 323 nm, and 30 degrees C, respectively. The run time was 15 min under these chromatographic conditions. Excellent linear relationship between peak area and favipiravir concentration in the range of 10-100 mg mL(-1) has been observed (r(2), 0.9999). Developed method has been found to be sensitive (limits of detection and quantification were 1.20 mg mL(-1) and 3.60 mg mL(-1), respectively), precise (the interday and intraday relative standard deviation (RSD) values for peak area and retention time were less than 0.4 and 0.2%, respectively), accurate (recovery, 99.19-100.17%), specific and robust (% RSD were less than 1.00, for system suitability parameters).

Nevertheless, some patients may not fully recover to their normal muscle strength, while exposing to potential side effects of these drugs. We report thefirst case of IIM and axonal peripheral polyneuropathy in a poorlycontrolled coeliac patient, who made complete recovery withadherence to gluten-free diet.MethodsA 76-year-old white Caucasian lady, who was previously independent, presented with 6-weeks history of pain and weakness in both legs. Sherequired the use of a wheelchair to get around as she was unable toweight bear as the result of the pain. She denied any change to regularmedications, history of trauma, new rash, joint swelling, or Bsymptoms. There was no history of smoking, alcohol, statins, orsteroid use. She was previously diagnosed with coeliac disease 10years ago but had opted not to adhere to a gluten-free diet due topersonal preference.ResultsOn examination, there was significant muscle tenderness on palpationof bilateral lower limbs. The rest of systemic examination wasunremarkable. Duodenal biopsy revealed severe villous atrophy andchronic lymphocytic and plasma cell inflammation, which reinforcedthe diagnosis of coeliac disease. All immunology screen includingANA, ENA, ds-DNA, myositis and vasculitis screen were negativeexcept anti-RO-52. This patient did not have any clinical feature ofSjogren's or systemic lupus erythematosus. EMG revealed fibrillationpotentials, positive sharp waves, and myotonic discharges in theparaspinal, upper and lower limbs muscles. It also demonstratedunderlying axonal peripheral polyneuropathy. Muscle biopsy showedfeatures consistent with the diagnosis of idiopathic inflammatorymyopathy. This patient was started on a gluten-free diet duringadmission. Interestingly, we discovered that her creatinine kinase levelhad improved spontaneously along with the clinical improvement ofher presenting symptoms. As her symptoms have completelyresolved, she was discharged home. She was never started on steroidor immunosuppressant due to her significant clinical improvement. Atthree-month follow up, her creatinine kinase level had normalised, andshe remained in remission while adhering to a gluten-free diet.ConclusionTo the best of our knowledge, there is no reported case of completeclinical resolution of IIM with gluten withdrawal in coeliac diseasepatients, without the need of steroid or immunosuppressants. Inaddition, the concomitant of myopathy and polyneuropathy, as somedescribed as neuromyositis, is extremely rare. The pathophysiologyremains unclear;however, it is proposed that neuropathy could be anextra-muscular manifestation of IIM.The clinical remission of IIM in ourpatient with adherence to a gluten-free diet provide an alternativetreatment option to the current recommended regimes of steroid andimmunosuppressants.

The new virus was later named SARS-CoV-2. The virus has affected tens of thousands of patients in the world. The infection of SARS-CoV-2 causes severe pneumonia and even death. It is urgently needed to find a therapeutic method to treat patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Studies showed that the surface spike (S) protein is essential for the coronavirus binding and entry of host cells. The heptad repeats 1 and 2 (HR1 and HR2) in the S protein play a decisive role in the fusion of the viral membrane with the host cell membrane. We predicted the HR1 and HR2 regions in S protein by sequence alignment. We simulated a computational model of HR1/2 regions and the fusion core. The binding energy of HR1 and HR2 of the fusion core was -33.4 kcal/mol. We then designed antivirus peptides by molecular dynamics simulation of the fusion core. The binding energy of HR2-based antiviral peptide to HR1 was -43.0 kcal/mol, which was stronger than the natural stage of the fusion core, suggesting that the predicted antiviral peptide can competitively bind with HR1 to prevent forming of the fusion core. The antiviral peptides can prevent SARS-CoV-2 membrane fusion and can potentially be used for the prevention and treatment of infections.","Ling, Rongsong; Dai, Yarong; Huang, Boxuan; Huang, Wenjie; Yu, Jianfeng; Lu, Xifeng; Jiang, Yizhou",Peptides,425,24

Despite the Brazilian national guideline protecting breastfeeding practices, there are many concerns about protecting infants from their infected mothers. This study aimed to analyze how the Brazilian hospitals and maternity services promote and support mothers suspected or diagnosed with coronavirus disease (COVID-19). METHODS: This is a descriptive cross-sectional and multicenter study which collected data from 24 Brazilian hospitals and maternity services between March and July 2020. Representatives of the institutions completed a questionnaire based on acts to promote and support breastfeeding, the Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative, and Brazil's federal law recommendations. RESULTS: The results showed that in delivery rooms, 98.5% of the services prohibited immediate and uninterrupted skin-to-skin contact between mothers and their infants and did not support mothers to initiate breastfeeding in the first hour. On the postnatal ward, 98.5% of the services allowed breastfeeding while implementing respiratory hygiene practices to prevent transmission of COVID-19. Companions for mothers were forbidden in 83.3% of the hospitals. Hospital discharge was mostly between 24 and 28 h (79.1%); discharge guidelines were not individualized. Additionally, a lack of support was noticed from the home environment's health community network (83.3%). Hospital and home breast pumping were allowed (87.5%), but breast milk donation was not accepted (95.8%). There was a lack of guidance regarding the use of infant comforting strategies. Guidelines specific for vulnerable populations were not covered in the material evaluated. CONCLUSIONS: In Brazil, hospitals have not followed recommendations to protect, promote, and support breastfeeding during the COVID-19 outbreak. The disagreement between international guidelines has been a major issue. The absence of recommendations on breastfeeding support during the pandemic led to difficulties in developing standards among hospitals in different regions of Brazil and other countries worldwide. The scientific community needs to discuss how to improve maternal and infant care services to protect breastfeeding in the current pandemic.","Gonçalves-Ferri, Walusa Assad; Pereira-Cellini, Fábia Martins; Coca, Kelly; Aragon, Davi Casale; Nader, Paulo; Lyra, João Cesar; do Vale, Maryneia Silva; Marba, Sérgio; Araujo, Katiaci; Dias, Laura Afonso; de Lima Mota Ferreira, Daniela Marques; Nieto, Gislayne; Anchieta, Lêni Marcia; de Cássia Silveira, Rita; de Moura, Marta David Rocha; Tuma Calil, Valdenise Martins L; Moraes, Viviane Christina Cortez; de Almeida, João Henrique Carvalho Leme; Magalhães, Maurício; Sonini, Thaise Cristina Branchee; Javorsky, Juliane Barleta; Ribeiro, Érica Lobato Acaui; Ferreira, Rodrigo; de Almeida, Louise Dantas Cavalcante; Garbers, Rosângela; da Silva Faria, Gabriella Maset; Roosch, Anelise; de Mesquita, Ana Ruth Antunes; de Oliveira Pinto, Rebecca Meirelles",Int Breastfeed J,425,21

METHODS: RNA remnants, purified from diagnostic nasopharyngeal specimens, were used as templates for RT-PCR specific detection of SG E gene RNA. As controls, we also detected viral genomic RNA for the E gene and/or a human housekeeping gene (RNase P). RESULTS: We assessed the samples of 60 RT-PCR-positive cases with a prolonged viral SARS-CoV-2 shedding (24-101 days) since the first diagnostic RT-PCR. SG viral RNA was detected in 12/60 (20%) of the persistent cases, 28-79 days after the onset of symptoms. The age range of the cases with prolonged viral shedding and presence of SG RNA was quite wide (40-100 years), and they were equally distributed between males (42%) and females (58%). None was HIV positive, although seven were immunosuppressed. According to the severity of the COVID-19 episodes they were mild (40%), intermediate (20%), and severe (40%)Conclusion: In a percentage of persistent positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive cases the presence of actively replicating virus may be inferred, far beyond diagnosis.

RESULTS: There were 90 research centers participating in the survey, with 70 of them from Brazil. The majority were partly private or fully private (n = 77; 85.6%) and had confirmed COVID-19 cases at the institution (n = 57; 63.3%). Accruals were suspended at least for some studies in 80% (n = 72) of the responses, mostly because of sponsors' decision. Clinical trials' routine was affected by medical visits cancelation, reduction of patients' attendance, reduction of other specialties' availability, and/or alterations on follow-up processes. Formal COVID-19 mitigation policies were adopted in 96.7% of the centers, including remote monitoring and remote site initiation visits, telemedicine visits, reduction of research team workdays or home office, special consent procedures, shipment of oral drugs directly to patients' home, and increase in outpatient diagnostic studies. Importantly, some of these changes were suggested to be part of future oncology clinical trials' routine, particularly the ones regarding remote methods, such as telemedicine.

We subsequently analyzed a longitudinal time series of 89 settled solids samples from a single plant for SARS-CoV-2 RNA as well as coronavirus recovery (bovine coronavirus) and fecal strength (pepper mild mottle virus) controls. SARS-CoV-2 RNA targets N1 and N2 concentrations correlated positively and significantly with COVID-19 clinically confirmed case counts in the sewershed. Together, the results demonstrate that measuring SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations in settled solids may be a more sensitive approach than measuring SARS-CoV-2 in influent.","Graham, Katherine E; Loeb, Stephanie K; Wolfe, Marlene K; Catoe, David; Sinnott-Armstrong, Nasa; Kim, Sooyeol; Yamahara, Kevan M; Sassoubre, Lauren M; Mendoza Grijalva, Lorelay M; Roldan-Hernandez, Laura; Langenfeld, Kathryn; Wigginton, Krista R; Boehm, Alexandria B",Environ. sci. technol,425,20

METHODS: An international multidisciplinary panel of experts convened to build a virtual learning community for tracheostomy care, comprising a web-based platform, five distance learning (interactive webinar) sessions, and professional discourse over 12 months. Structured pre- and post-webinar surveys were disseminated to global participants including otolaryngologists, intensivists, nurses, allied health professionals, and patients/caregivers. Data were collected on audio-visual fidelity, demographics, and pre- and post-tutorial assessments regarding experience and skill acquisition. Participants reported confidence levels for NICU, pediatric, adult, and family care, as well as technical skills, communication, learning, assessment, and subdomains. RESULTS: Participants from 197 institutions in 22 countries engaged in the virtual education platform, including otolaryngologists, speech pathologists, respiratory therapists, specialist nurses, patients, and caregivers. Significant improvements were reported in communication (P < .0001), clinical assessments (P < .0001), and clinical governance (P < .0001), with positive impact on pediatric decannulation (P = .0008), adult decannulation (P = .04), and quality improvement (P < .0001). Respondents reported enhanced readiness to integrate knowledge into practice. Barriers included time zones, internet bandwidth, and perceived difficulty of direct clinical translation of highly technical skills. Participants rated the implementation highly in terms of length, ability for discussion, satisfaction, applicability to professional practice, and expertise of discussants (median scores: 4, 4, 4, 4 and 5 out of 5). CONCLUSIONS: Virtual learning has dominated the education landscape during COVID-19 pandemic, but few data are available on its effectiveness. This study demonstrated feasibility of virtual learning for disseminating best practices in tracheostomy, engaging a diverse, multidisciplinary audience. Learning of complex technical skills proved a hurdle, however, suggesting need for hands-on experience for technical mastery. While interactive videoconferencing via webinar affords an engaging and scalable strategy for sharing knowledge, further investigation is needed on clinical outcomes to define effective strategies for experiential online learning and virtual in-service simulations.","Swords, Chloe; Bergman, Lina; Wilson-Jeffers, Rachel; Randall, Diane; Morris, Linda L; Brenner, Michael J; Arora, Asit",Ann Otol Rhinol Laryngol,425,23

Here we present a unique case of COVID-19 associated hypercoagulability manifesting as both PE and apical left ventricular (LV) thrombosis in the absence of underlying coronary artery disease (CAD). Case: A 71-year-old female with a diagnosis of mild COVID-19 pneumonia presented with worsening fatigue, cough, shortness of breath, and chest heaviness on the thirteenth day of her illness. The patient was hypoxic on presentation requiring 3 L supplemental oxygen. Laboratory analysis showed an extremely high D-dimer level (greater than 20,000 ng/mL). Hence, computed tomography angiography of the chest was performed, showing evidence of right lower lobe segmental and subsegmental PE along with bilateral multifocal consolidation. Incidentally, the imaging demonstrated a filling defect within the apex of LV, transcending into further cardiac workup. Initial troponin was elevated at 0.04 ng/mL, and electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm without any acute ST-T wave changes. Transthoracic echocardiography confirmed the presence of large, sessile, mobile, 1.3 x 2.1 cm LV thrombus but normal LV systolic function, ejection fraction, and no evidence of regional wall motion abnormalities. However, due to ongoing chest heaviness, the decision was made to perform a diagnostic left heart catheterization, which showed insignificant CAD. The patient received treatment with convalescent plasma, Remdesivir, and dexamethasone as per our institutional protocol and started on unfractionated heparin for anticoagulation. She was discharged on enoxaparin as per the patient's preference on a stable condition with close cardiology follow up. DiscussionLV thrombosis is a well-known complication of LV dysfunction associated with ischemic cardiomyopathy. While PE is an established phenomenon of COVID- 19 induced hypercoagulability, thrombus formation within the cardiac chamber is rarely reported. As cardiovascular complications such as acute myocardial injury, myocarditis, and cardiomyopathy are substantially reported in COVID-19, through this case report, we highlight the rare presentation of COVID 19 hypercoagulability with LV thrombus in the absence of predisposing cardiac conditions such as myocardial infarction or atrial fibrillation. Although the mechanism remains unclear, endothelial dysfunction eliciting local myocardial inflammation and blood stasis is a plausible explanation. Early recognition of LV thrombus and treatment with anticoagulation is of paramount importance to reducing stroke risk and systemic embolization. The detection of LV thrombus mandates anticoagulation with warfarin or heparin due to insufficient evidence to support the use of direct oral anticoagulants.","Azhar, A.; Bk, A.; Hadzipasic, O.",American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,425,16

Unfortunately, there is a non-available effective treatment to combat these viruses. Domain-motif interactions (DMIs) are an essential means by which viruses mimic and hijack the biological processes of host cells. To disentangle how viruses achieve this process can help to develop new rational therapies. Data mining was performed to obtain DMIs stored as regular expressions (regexp) in 3DID and ELM databases. The mined regexp information was mapped on the coronaviruses' proteomes. Most motifs on viral protein that could interact with human proteins are shared across the coronavirus species, indicating that molecular mimicry is a common strategy for coronavirus infection. Enrichment ontology analysis for protein domains showed a shared biological process and molecular function terms related to carbon source utilization and potassium channel regulation. Some of the mapped motifs were nested on B, and T cell epitopes, suggesting that it could be as an alternative way for reverse vaccinology. The information obtained in this study could be used for further theoretic and experimental explorations on coronavirus infection mechanism and development of medicines for treatment.","Martínez, Yamelie A; Guo, Xianwu; Portales-Pérez, Diana P; Rivera, Gildardo; Castañeda-Delgado, Julio E; García-Pérez, Carlos A; Enciso-Moreno, José A; Lara-Ramírez, Edgar E",PLoS One,425,24

Recently, a new case definition has been proposed by the Management of Aortic Graft Infection Collaboration (MAGIC) to close the diagnostic gap. The aim of this study was to validate the MAGIC criteria as a suggested diagnostic standard for the diagnosis of suspected VGEI in the prospective Vascular Graft Cohort study (VASGRA). METHODS: VASGRA is an open, prospective, observational cohort study. Prospective participants in VASGRA between 2013 and 2019 were included (257 patients; 137 with VGEI). The accuracy of the MAGIC criteria for a diagnosis of VGEI was evaluated retrospectively by calculating the sensitivity and specificity vs. the consensually adjudicated VASGRA infection status. RESULTS: The VASGRA cohort categorised 137 (53.3%) patients as ""diseased"" and 120 patients as ""not diseased""; using the MAGIC criteria, 183/257 (71.2%) patients were considered to be ""diseased"". Thus, for the MAGIC criteria, a sensitivity of 99% (95% confidence interval [CI] 96-100) and a specificity of 61% (95% CI 52-70) were calculated. Considering suspected VGEI according to the MAGIC criteria as ""not diseased"" achieved congruent assessments of the VASGRA team and the MAGIC criteria, with a sensitivity of 93% and a specificity of 93%. The accuracy of the MAGIC criteria for the different graft locations were also compared. If the suspected VGEIs were assigned to the ""not diseased"" group, VGEIs of the thoracic aorta seemed to have a poorer sensitivity (86%; 95% CI 73-95) than the other graft locations. CONCLUSION: The current MAGIC criteria offer good sensitivity and specificity in the context of true infections but a reduced specificity for a possible VGEI.","Anagnostopoulos, Alexia; Mayer, Fabienne; Ledergerber, Bruno; Bergadà-Pijuan, Judith; Husmann, Lars; Mestres, Carlos A; Rancic, Zoran; Hasse, Barbara",Eur. j. vasc. endovasc. surg,425,24

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In-hospital patients confirmed COVID-19 from January 18, 2020, to March 7, 2020, were retrospectively enrolled. PA trunk diameters on admission and death events were collected to calculate the optimum cutoff using a receiver operating characteristic curve. According to the cutoff, the subjects on admission were divided into two groups. Then the in-hospital various parameters were compared between the two groups to assess the predictive value of PA trunk diameter. RESULTS: In the 180 enrolled in-hospital patients (46.99 ± 14.95 years; 93 (51.7%) female, 14 patients (7.8%) died during their hospitalization. The optimum cutoff PA trunk diameter to predict in-hospital mortality was > 29 mm with a sensitivity of 92.59% and a specificity of 91.11%. Kaplan-Meier survival curves for PA trunk diameter on admission showed that a PA trunk diameter > 29 mm was a significant predictor of subsequent death (log-rank < 0.001, median survival time of PA > 29 mm was 28 days). CONCLUSION: PA trunk enlargement can be a useful predictive factor for distinguishing between mild and severe COVID-19 disease progression.","Zhu, Qing-Qing; Gong, Tao; Huang, Guo-Quan; Niu, Zhong-Feng; Yue, Ting; Xu, Fang-Yi; Chen, Chao; Wang, Guang-Bin",Jpn J Radiol,425,1

The Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) was used to investigate attitudes, moods and behavior during lockdown in England. ALSPAC participants were invited to complete online questionnaires in May 2020, including a set of questions about frequency of gambling and gambling activities which had been asked three years previously. Mental health and wellbeing data and alcohol use were also collected as part of lockdown questionnaires. Gambling questions were completed by 2632 young adults, 71% female, with a mean age of 27.8 years. Overall, gambling frequency reduced during lockdown for both males and females, but more males engaged in regular (weekly) gambling. Gambling activities became more restricted compared to previous reports, but online gambling (e.g. online poker, bingo, casino games) was more frequent. Previous gambling behaviour predicted gambling frequency during lockdown. No associations were apparent between gambling frequency and measures of mental health and well-being. Heavy alcohol use was strongly linked with regular gambling during lockdown. Gamblers were more than twice as likely as non-gamblers to have experienced financial difficulties pre-COVID, but gambling frequency was not related to employment status during lockdown. Online gambling increased during lockdown, whilst offline gambling activities decreased in frequency. A small minority of regular weekly gamblers, who tended to be male and heavy users of alcohol, participated in a wide range of online and offline gambling activities.","Emond, Alan; Nairn, Agnes; Collard, Sharon; Hollén, Linda",J. gambl. stud,425,10

The WHO/PNIPH, WHO/EMRO, and the Palestinian MoH carried out a serological survey in Palestine in order to estimate the actual number of COVID-19 infections up to the end of December 2020. A sample stratified by region, district, residence area (urban, rural, and refugee camp), and accounting for gender, was taken from Gaza and the West Bank. Data from participants were also collected, including demographic, socio-economic, and health conditions. The results show that 39% of the Palestinian population (38% of the West Bank and 40% of Gaza) had been infected with COVID-19 by the end of December, almost 10 times the number detected by targeted Rt-PCR testing. Several factors were calculated to be significant such as diabetes, smoking, gender, age, and residence. Summary of findingsThe following table is a summary of all findings presented in this report. The P values in green are below 0.05, which makes the result statistically significant; red is not statistically significant. In binary comparisons (when comparing two numbers), the odds were calculated, meaning how much more likely the presence of seropositivity is if the condition is satisfied.

The treatment goal is to reduce the fatality rate in 15% to 20% of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 who develop severe inflammatory conditions that can lead to pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. These conditions are major causes of death in these patients. Convalescent plasma (CP) collected from patients recovered from the novel corona virus disease (COVID-19) has been considered as an effective treatment method for COVID-19. Moreover, low-dose radiation therapy (LDRT) for COVID-19 pneumonia was historically used to treat pneumonia during the first half of the 20th century. The concept of LDRT for COVID-19 pneumonia was first introduced in March 2020. Later scientists from Canada, Spain, United States, Germany and France also confirmed the potential efficacy of LDRT for treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia. The rationale behind introducing LDRT as an effective treatment method for pneumonia in COVID-19 patients is not only due to its anti-inflammatory effect, but also in optimization of the activity of the immune system. Moreover, LDRT, unlike other treatment methods such as antiviral drugs, does not have the key disadvantage of exerting a significant selective pressure on the SARS-CoV-2 virus and hence does not lead to evolution of the virus through mutations. Given these considerations, we believe that a hybrid treatment including both CP and LDRT can trigger synergistic responses that will help healthcare providers in mitigating today's COVID-19 pandemic.","H, Abdollahi; I, Shiri; J J, Bevelacqua; A, Jafarzadeh; A, Rahmim; H, Zaidi; S A R, Mortazavi; S M J, Mortazavi",J Biomed Phys Eng,425,1

Finally, given the unprecedented historical time that the airline industry is facing at the moment of writing, we provided some insights into how the COVID-19 pandemic affected the global capacity of integrators and other cargo airlines. Our results suggest that full-cargo airlines and, much more dramatically, combination airlines were impacted by the pandemic.

BACKGROUND: Nurses play a vital role in managing the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, while confronting enormous challenges and psychological problems. METHODS: Action research design was adopted to develop and provide a targeted psychological support scheme to 1,496 frontline nurses. Data regarding nurses' feedback were collected from WeChat group chat and Moments, letters, and comments on theme lectures. Subsequently, qualitative content analysis was conducted using MAXQDA. RESULTS: A targeted psychological support scheme was formed via three action cycles according to nurses' needs. Frontline nurses received psychological assistance from a research team, which offered (1) a sense of belonging, (2) perceived pride, (3) being touched, confidence, and growth. CONCLUSION: The researchers successfully provided targeted psychological support to nurses, and nurses were motivated and became more confident when their needs were addressed. IMPLICATION FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: Nurses have various types of psychological needs, which could be addressed by targeted support. It is suggested that nurse managers should identify nurses' needs in real time and provide appropriate support through multidisciplinary collaboration to improve their confidence and enhance their resilience.","Chen, Shaohua; Liu, Jun-E; Bai, Xiaoyu; Yue, Peng; Luo, Shixiang",J. nurs. manag,425,1

This study focused on the drivers of China's renewable energy consumption (REC) by an extended production-theoretical decomposition analysis and emphasized REC technical efficiency and technological change in 28 provinces during 1997-2017. We then projected China's REC to 2030 based on nine scenarios using a Monte Carlo simulation approach and specifically considering the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the national economy. The decomposition results showed that economic growth and population scale generally contributed to an increase in REC at national and provincial levels over the period while the overall technical efficiency and technological change in REC played limited roles in prompting REC nationally. The projection results indicated that the target that generates 50% of its electricity from renewable energy sources for China, could be achieved by 2030 if enough actions are taken to accelerate renewable energy development.

This feature renders the &#963;1 receptor an ideal target for the development of multifunctional ligands, whose benefits are now recognized because several pathologies are multifactorial. Indeed, the current therapeutic regimens are based on the administration of different classes of drugs in order to counteract the diverse unbalanced physiological pathways associated with the pathology. Thus, the multi-targeted directed ligand (MTDL) approach, with one molecule that exerts poly-pharmacological actions, may be a winning strategy that overcomes the pharmacokinetic issues linked to the administration of diverse drugs. This review aims to point out the progress in the development of MTDLs directed toward &#963;1 receptors for the treatment of central nervous system (CNS) and cancer diseases, with a focus on the perspectives that are proper for this strategy. The evidence that some drugs in clinical use unintentionally bind the &#963;1 protein (as off-target) provides a proof of concept of the potential of this strategy, and it strongly supports the promise that the &#963;1 receptor holds as a target to be hit in the context of MTDLs for the therapy of multifactorial pathologies.","Abatematteo, Francesca Serena; Niso, Mauro; Contino, Marialessandra; Leopoldo, Marcello; Abate, Carmen",Int. j. mol. sci.

Genetic variation generated through hybridization between distantly related lineages can promote AR. This mechanism, however, requires rare coincidence in space and time between a hybridization event and opening of ecological opportunity, because hybridization generates large genetic variation only locally and it will persist only for a short period. Hence, hybridization seems unlikely to explain recurrent AR in the same lineage. Contrary to these expectations, our evolutionary computer simulations demonstrate that admixture variation can geographically spread and persist for long periods if the hybrid population becomes separated into isolated sub-lineages. Subsequent secondary hybridization of some of these can reestablish genetic polymorphisms from the ancestral hybridization in places far from the birthplace of the hybrid clade and long after the ancestral hybridization event. Consequently, simulations revealed conditions where exceptional genetic variation, once generated through a rare hybridization event, can facilitate multiple ARs exploiting ecological opportunities available at distant points in time and space.","Kagawa, Kotaro; Seehausen, Ole",Proc Biol Sci,425,14

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study included 28 patients (18 with CPPD, 10 controls) who underwent DECT of the wrist. Collagen density maps were reconstructed from the DECT datasets and used to measure densities in regions of interest (ROIs) placed in the scapholunate (SL) ligament (dorsal, palmar, proximal), lunotriquetral (LT) ligament, and extensor carpi radialis (ECR) tendon, (n = 260 measurements). The presence of calcifications on standard CT images in these regions was assessed by a blinded reader. Densities were compared with nonparametric tests, and linear regression analysis was performed to investigate the impact of age, sex, and CT- detected calcium deposition on collagen density. RESULTS: Collagen density in the SL ligament was significantly higher in CPPD patients than in controls (overall mean: 265.4 ± 32.1 HU vs. 196.3 ± 33.8 HU; p < 0.001). In the ECR tendon, collagen densities did not differ significantly (p = 0.672): 161.3 ± 20.1 HU in CPPD vs. 163.6 ± 12.0 HU in controls. Regression analysis showed that diagnosis, but not age or calcification, had a significant impact on collagen density. CONCLUSION: Collagen density of the SL ligament is significantly higher in CPPD patients than in control patients. Further research is needed to understand these changes in the extracellular matrix of ligaments in CPPD.","Ziegeler, Katharina; Richter, Sophia-Theresa; Hermann, Sandra; Hermann, Kay Geert A; Hamm, Bernd; Diekhoff, Torsten",Skelet. radiol,425,24

It remains unclear whether vertical severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) occurs during pregnancy and how such infection will affect fetal development. Here, we performed single-cell transcriptomic analysis of placenta and other tissues from fetuses in comparison with those from adults using public-available datasets. Our analysis revealed that a very small proportion of trophoblast cells expressed the Angiotensin I Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) gene, suggesting a low possibility of vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from mother to fetus during pregnancy. We found that the fetal adrenal gland, heart, kidney and stomach were susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, because these organs contained cell clusters that expressed high levels of the ACE2 gene. In particular, a higher proportion of ACE2-expressing cell clusters in the adrenal gland and kidney also expressed the Transmembrane Serine Protease 2 (TMPRSS2) gene compared with other organs. Surprisingly, ACE2-expressing type II alveolar (AT2) equivalent cells were absent in fetal lungs. This is in sharp contrast to adult lungs. As ACE2 expression is regulated by various conditions, including oxygen concentration, inflammation and smoking, caution is warranted to avoid triggering potential ACE2 expression in fetal and placental tissue.","Lü, Mengdie; Qiu, Li; Jia, Guangshuai; Guo, Rongqun; Leng, Qibin",Aging (Albany NY),425,24

METHODS: In hospitalized patients, the acute phase disease duration was followed using the Brescia-COVID respiratory severity scale. Noninvasive ventilation was administered based on clinical judgment. Patients requiring oropharyngeal intubation were excluded from the study. For parameters to be measured at the hospital entrance, age, clinical history, National Early Warning Score 2 (a multiparametric score system), partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood/fraction of inspired oxygen (P/F ratio), C-reactive protein, and blood cell count were selected. RESULTS: In 64 patients, age (direct relationship), P/F, and platelet number (inverse relationship) independently accounted for 43% of the acute phase duration of the disease (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, the present results revealed that the acute phase duration of noncomplicated pneumonia, resulting from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, is independently predicted from a patient's age, as well as based on the hospital entrance values of P/F ratio and peripheral blood platelet count.","Carallo, Claudio; Pugliese, Fabiola; Tripolino, Cesare; Lenzi, Lorenza; Oliveri, Chiara; Fasani, Giada; Guarrera, Giovanni M; Spagnolli, Walter; Cozzio, Susanna",J Med Virol,425,16

A secondary aim was to investigate whether associations varied by age. METHODS: The cohort comprised COVID-19 positive Veterans Health Administration (VHA) patients (N=9,347). For each outcome, we fit piecewise logistic regression models with restricted cubic splines (knots at BMIs of 23, 30, 39), adjusting for: age, sex, comorbidities, VHA nursing home residence, and race/ethnicity. Supplemental analyses included age-by-BMI interaction terms (alpha=0.05). RESULTS: We found evidence of a nonlinear J-curve association between BMI and likelihood of hospitalization and mortality. BMI was associated with increased odds for hospitalization, ICU admission, and mortality among patients with BMIs 30-39, but decreased odds of hospitalization and mortality for patients with BMIs 23-30. Patients under age 75 with BMIs 30-39 had increased odds for mortality with increasing BMI. CONCLUSION: Odds for severe outcomes with COVID-19 infection increased with increasing BMI for people with, but not without obesity. This non-linear relationship should be tested in future research. COVID-19 public health messages in VHA, and broadly, should incorporate information about risks associated with all classes of obesity, particularly for those under age 75.","Breland, Jessica Y; Wong, Michelle S; Steers, W Neil; Yuan, Anita H; Haderlein, Taona P; Washington, Donna L",Obesity (Silver Spring),425,29

Twenty adult children of an ill person were interviewed via phone and video call, in adherence with the restrictions against COVID-19. Thematic analysis showed five main themes: The caregiver's experience, the care recipient's experience, relationships with care recipients, changes in the care routine and resources. Results pointed out that the time needed in the care routine and everyday activities increased during the pandemic, together with the need to find alternatives to physical activity at home. Depending on one's personal experience of COVID-19 and approach to preventive rules, the availability of resources and formal and informal support, three main approaches to care were identified: Apprehensive, mindful and fatalistic ones. The pandemic amplified the differences among these already-existing approaches to care as well as the typical challenges and difficulties experienced by family caregivers, and it resulted in an increased burden connected to practical difficulties, emotional stress and difficulties in reaching for help. These results underline the importance of strengthening the external support network for older people to help family caregivers, especially during emergencies. © 2021 American Medical Association.

Background While the general issues of business informing, and business intelligence (BI) in particular, have been widely researched, the dynamics of informing, their ability to act in accord with changes in business and preserve the key competencies has not been widely researched. In particular, the research on BI agility is rather scattered, and many issues need to be clarified. Methodology A series of in-depth interviews with BI professionals to determine relations between organizational agility and BI agility, and to round up a set of key factors of BI agility. Contribution The paper clarifies a candidate set of key factors of BI agility and gives ground for future research in relations with areas like corporate and BI resilience and culture. Findings The interview results show the relations between organizational changes, and changes in BI activities. BI has limited potential in recognizing important external changes but can be rather helpful in making decision choices and detecting internal problems. Lack of communication between business and IT people, existence of data silos and shadow BI, and general inadequacy of organizational and BI culture are the key factors impairing BI agility. Recommendations There are practical issues around BI agility that need solving, like the reason-for Practitioners able coverage of standards or creation of a dedicated unit to care about BI potential. Recommendations The research is still in its starting phase, but additional interesting directions for Researchers start to emerge, like relations between BI agility, resilience and corporate agil ity, or the role of informing culture and BI culture for BI agility issues. Impact on Society Agile business, especially in times of global shocks like COVID-19, loses less value and has more chances to survive. Future Research Most likely this will be focused on the relations between BI agility, resilience, and corporate agility, and the role of informing culture and BI culture for BI agility issues. © 2021.

METHODS: The study population included patients who underwent head and neck surgery at an academic tertiary care center between February 2020 and November 2020 and were discharged with one to four drains with instructions for home removal. Prior to discharge, patients received thorough drain removal education. Patients were prospectively followed to evaluate for associated outcomes. RESULTS: One hundred patients were evaluated in the study. There was record for ninety-seven patients receiving education at discharge. The most common methods of education were face-to-face education and written instructions with educational video link provided. Of 123 drains upon discharge, 110 drains (89.4%) were removed at home while 13 (10.6%) were removed in office. Most drains were located in the neck (86.4%). There was one seroma, two hematomas, two drain site infections, and five ED visits; however, none of these complications were directly associated with the action of drain removal at home. Calculated cost savings for travel and lost wages was $259.82 per round trip saved. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate that home drain removal can provide a safe and efficacious option for patients following head and neck surgery. This approach was safe and associated with patient cost savings and better utilization of provider's time. Furthermore, patients and healthcare providers avoided additional in-person encounters and exposures during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings warrant further investigation into cost savings and formal patient satisfaction associated with home drain removal.

Existing studies mainly apply transfer learning and other data representation strategies to generate accurate point estimates. The generalization power of these networks is always questionable due to being developed using small datasets and failing to report their predictive confidence. Quantifying uncertainties associated with DNN predictions is a prerequisite for their trusted deployment in medical settings. Here we apply and evaluate three uncertainty quantification techniques for COVID-19 detection using chest X-Ray (CXR) images. The novel concept of uncertainty confusion matrix is proposed and new performance metrics for the objective evaluation of uncertainty estimates are introduced. Through comprehensive experiments, it is shown that networks pertained on CXR images outperform networks pretrained on natural image datasets such as ImageNet. Qualitatively and quantitatively evaluations also reveal that the predictive uncertainty estimates are statistically higher for erroneous predictions than correct predictions. Accordingly, uncertainty quantification methods are capable of flagging risky predictions with high uncertainty estimates. We also observe that ensemble methods more reliably capture uncertainties during the inference.","Asgharnezhad, Hamzeh; Shamsi, Afshar; Alizadehsani, Roohallah; Khosravi, Abbas; Nahavandi, Saeid; Sani, Zahra Alizadeh; Srinivasan, Dipti",,425,20

The new information on the pandemic emerging daily has made it challenging for healthcare workers (HCWs) to stay current with the latest knowledge, which could influence their attitudes and practices during patient care.This study is a follow-up evaluation of changes in HCWs' knowledge, attitudes, and practices as well as anxiety levels regarding COVID-19 since the beginning of the pandemic. Data were collected through an anonymous, predesigned, self-administered questionnaire that was sent online to HCWs in Saudi Arabia.The questionnaire was sent to 1500 HCWs, with a 63.8% response rate (Nâ=â957). The majority of respondents were female (83%), and the most common age group was 31 to 40âyears (52.2%). Nurses constituted 86.3% of the respondents. HCWs reported higher anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic which increased from 4.91â±â2.84 to 8.6â±â2.27 on an 11-point Likert scale compared to other viral outbreaks. HCWs believed that their own preparedness as well as that of their hospital's intensive care unit or emergency room was higher during the COVID-19 pandemic than during the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus pandemic (2012-2015). About 58% of HCWs attended one or more simulations concerning the management of COVID-19 patients in their intensive care unit/emergency room, and nearly all had undergone N95 mask fit testing. The mean score of HCWs' knowledge of COVID-19 was 9.89/12. For most respondents (94.6%), the perception of being at increased risk of infection was the main cause of anxiety related to COVID-19; the mean score of anxiety over COVID-19 increased from 4.91â±â2.84 before to 8.6â±â2.27 during the pandemic in Saudi Arabia.HCWs' anxiety levels regarding COVID-19 have increased since a pandemic was declared. It is vital that healthcare facilities provide more emotional and psychological support for all HCWs.","Temsah, Mohamad-Hani; Al Huzaimi, Abdullah; Alrabiaah, Abdulkarim; Alamro, Nurah; Al-Sohime, Fahad; Al-Eyadhy, Ayman; Alhasan, Khalid; Kari, Jameela A; Alhaboob, Ali; Alsalmi, Amro; AlMuhanna, Wejdan; Almaghlouth, Ibrahim; Aljamaan, Fadi; Halwani, Rabih; Saddik, Basema; Barry, Mazin; Al-Zamil, Fahad; AlHadi, Ahmad N; Al-Subaie, Sarah; Jamal, Amr; Somily, Ali Mohammed",Medicine (Baltimore),425,5

The relation between radiological changes in CXR and clinical severity of the disease in symptomatic patients with COVID 19 has not been fully studied and there is no scoring system for the severity of the lung involvement, using the plain CXR. AIM OF THE STUDY: Current COVID-19 radiological literature is dominated by CT and a detailed description CXR appearances in relation to the disease time course is lacking. We propose an easy scoring system (CO X-RADS) to describe the severity of chest involvement in symptomatic COVID 19 patients using CXR and to correlate the radiological changes with the clinical severity of the disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The clinical manifestations and CXR findings were recorded in 500 symptomatic COVID-19 positive patients who were admitted to Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC) COVID-19 designated facility Center from January to June 2020. The severity and outcome of the disease included: intensive care unit admission, need for oxygen therapy, mechanical ventilation. and mortality rate. RESULTS: Most of our symptomatic patients (86.8%) had mild and moderate clinical manifestations. The remaining 13.2% had severe manifestations, including: fever, persistent dry cough, shortness of breath, dyspnea, abdominal and generalized body pains. Based on our radiological scoring system (0 to 10) patients were distributed according to their CXR findings into different categories and according to our suggested (CO X-RADS) severity system into five categories (0 to IV). Patients with mild clinical manifestations showed low scoring in CXR (score 0 up to 4) and they represented 72% of our patients. Patients with moderately severe clinical manifestations showed mainly GGO (scoring 5 and 6) and represented about 14.8% of patients. Patients presented with severe clinical manifestations had obvious lung consolidations at the time of presentation with CXR scoring system &#8805; 7 and represented about 13.2% of patients. CONCLUSION: We proposed a simple CXR reporting scoring system (CO X-RADS) to categorize COVID-19 patients according to their radiological severity. This radiological score was correlated well with the clinical severity score of patients. We encourage other centers to test this scoring system in correlation with the clinical status of patients.","De Sanctis, Vincenzo; Bedair, Elsaid M A; Soliman, Ashraf T; Nair, Arun Prabhakaran; Al Masalamani, Muna A; Yassin, Mohamed",Acta Biomed,425,20

The objective of this study is to characterize the clinical dermatological manifestations associated with COVID-19 infection in cases with few or without general symptoms in patients from Latin America. METHODS: Cross-sectional study using a questionnaire that was made for health professionals (physicians with a specialty in dermatology) to investigate dermatological lesions associated with COVID-19 infection in patients from 25 countries of Latin America. The survey was active from June 9 to July 30, 2020. RESULTS: In this study, information was collected from a total of 347 patients. We found a female gender predominance: 179/347 (51.6%). The mean age at presentation was 40.87 years. The most frequent dermatological manifestations were maculopapular rash and urticarial lesions, followed by papulovesicular lesions, vesicular lesions, chilblain-like lesions, papular lesions, ecchymosis, petechial purpura, pityriasis rosea-like lesions, pruritus, palmoplantar dysesthesias, transient livedo, acral necrosis, palpable purpura, livedo racemosa, and retiform purpura. As far as we know, there are no previous reports of pruritus and palmoplantar dysesthesias. CONCLUSIONS: This registry emphasizes skin manifestations as an important criterion for establishing the diagnosis of COVID-19 infection in Latin American countries. This information will be useful for the early identification of suspected cases by health professionals (dermatologists and nondermatologists) and will allow contact tracing to mitigate the impact on health systems at different levels.","Ocampo-Candiani, Jorge; Ramos-Cavazos, Cesar Jair; Arellano-Mendoza, Maria Ivonne; Arenas-Guzmán, Roberto; Beirana-Palencia, Angélica; Salmon-Demongin, Alfredo; Welsh-Hernández, Esperanza; Cabo, Horacio A; Gómez-Flores, Minerva; Dominguez-Cherit, Judith; Criado, Paulo Ricardo; Castro-López, Helena; Alfaro-Sánchez, Abraham Benjamin; García-Vargas, Alejandro; Cohen-Sabban, Emilia N; Del Solar, Manuel; Fich, Félix; Galimberti, Gastón; Gatti, Carlos Fernando; López-Estebaranz, José Luis; Lupi, Omar; Olmos-Pérez, Miguel; Pérez-Alfonzo, Ricardo",Int. j. dermatol,425,1

Time-frequency (T-F) masking is a common technique that aims to improve speech intelligibility by multiplying reverberant speech by a matrix of gain values to suppress T-F bins dominated by reverberation. Recently proposed mask estimation algorithms leverage machine learning approaches to distinguish between target speech and reverberant reflections. However, the spectro-temporal structure of speech is highly variable and dependent on the underlying phoneme. One way to potentially overcome this variability is to leverage explicit knowledge of phonemic information during mask estimation. This study proposes a phoneme-based mask estimation algorithm, where separate mask estimation models are trained for each phoneme. Sentence recognition tests were conducted in normal hearing listeners to determine whether a phoneme-based mask estimation algorithm is beneficial in the ideal scenario where perfect knowledge of the phoneme is available. The results showed that the phoneme-based masks improved the intelligibility of vocoded speech when compared to conventional phoneme-independent masks. The results suggest that a phoneme-based speech enhancement strategy may potentially benefit CI users in reverberant listening environments.","Chu, Kevin M.; Collins, Leslie M.; Mainsah, Boyla O.",,425,1

Evaluating social distancing is critical since it reflects the frequency of close human interactions. While questionnaire surveys or mobility data-based systems have provided valuable insights, social media data can contribute as an additional instrument to help monitor the risk of human interactions during the pandemic. For this reason, this study introduced a social media-based approach that quantifies the pro/anti-lockdown ratio as an indicator of the risk of human interactions. With the aid of natural language processing and machine learning techniques, this study classified the lockdown-related tweets and quantified the pro/anti-lockdown ratio for each state over time. The anti-lockdown ratio showed a moderate and negative correlation with the state-level social distancing index on a weekly basis, suggesting that people are more likely to travel out of the state where the higher anti-lockdown level is observed. The study further showed that the perception expressed on social media could reflect people's behaviors. The findings of the study are of significance for government agencies to assess the risk of close human interactions and to evaluate their policy effectiveness in the context of social distancing and lockdown.","Li, Lingyao; Ma, Zihui; Lee, Hyesoo; Lee, Sangyu",Int J Disaster Risk Reduct,425,15

The most amount of the death toll is accounted by old people affected by age-related diseases that develop a hyper-inflammatory syndrome. In this regard, we hypothesized that COVID-19 severity may be linked to inflammaging. Here, we examined 30 serum samples from patients enrolled in the clinical trial NCT04315480 assessing the clinical response to a single-dose intravenous infusion of the anti-IL-6 receptor drug Tocilizumab (TCZ) in COVID-19 patients with multifocal interstitial pneumonia. In these serum samples, as well as in 29 age- and gender-matched healthy control subjects, we assessed a set of microRNAs that regulate inflammaging, i.e. miR-146a-5p, miR-21-5p, and miR-126-3p, which were quantified by RT-PCR and Droplet Digital PCR. We showed that COVID-19 patients who did not respond to TCZ have lower serum levels of miR-146a-5p after the treatment (p = 0.007). Among non-responders, those with the lowest serum levels of miR-146a-5p experienced the most adverse outcome (p = 0.008). Our data show that a blood-based biomarker, such as miR-146a-5p, can provide clues about the molecular link between inflammaging and COVID-19 clinical course, thus allowing to better understand the use of biologic drug armory against this worldwide health threat.","Sabbatinelli, Jacopo; Giuliani, Angelica; Matacchione, Giulia; Latini, Silvia; Laprovitera, Noemi; Pomponio, Giovanni; Ferrarini, Alessia; Baroni, Silvia Svegliati; Pavani, Marianna; Moretti, Marco; Gabrielli, Armando; Procopio, Antonio Domenico; Ferracin, Manuela; Bonafè, Massimiliano; Olivieri, Fabiola",Mech Ageing Dev,425,24

The study here confronts this problem by developing a global analysis based on more than 160 countries. This paper proposes that Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita, healthcare spending and air pollution of nations are critical factors associated with fatality rate of COVID-19. The statistical evidence seems in general to support that countries with a low average COVID-19 fatality rate have high expenditures in health sector >7.5% of GDP, high health expenditures per capita >$2,300 and a lower exposure of population to days exceeding safe levels of particulate matter (PM2.5). Another relevant finding here is that these countries have lower case fatality rates (CFRs) of COVID-19, regardless a higher percentage of population aged more than 65 years. Overall, then, this study finds that an effective and proactive strategy to reduce the negative impact of future pandemics, driven by novel viral agents, has to be based on a planning of enhancement of healthcare sector and of sustainability in environment that can reduce fatality rate of infectious diseases in society.","Coccia, Mario",Environ Res,425,23

In its basic form, the problem is characterized by data association uncertainty whereby the association between the observations and agents must be deduced in addition to the agent state. In this paper, the large-$M$ limit is interpreted as a problem of collective filtering. This viewpoint is used to derive the equation for the empirical distribution of the hidden agent states. A feedback particle filter algorithm for this problem is presented and illustrated via numerical simulations.

A Significant decrease in CC rate (SMD: -0.28, 95%CI: -0.47 to -0.10) and CC depth (SMD: -0.26, 95%CI: -0.44 to -0.07) were observed in the PPE arm as compared to the no-PPE arm. The difference in CC rate was more prominently seen in adult CPR than in paediatric CPR. Without PPE, the proportion of adequate CC rate delivered was 0.74, which reduced significantly to 0.60 after use of PPE (p - 0.035). Similarly, the proportion of adequate CC depth was significantly lesser (p - 0.001) in PPE arm (0.55), as compared to that of the no-PPE arm (0.78). CONCLUSION: The use of PPE compromises the quality of CC during CPR significantly, and newer ways to deliver chest compression has to be investigated. This study was prospectively registered in PROSPERO (CRD42020192031).","Sahu, Ankit Kumar; Suresh, Soorya; Mathew, Roshan; Aggarwal, Praveen; Nayer, Jamshed",Am. j. emerg. med,425,32

OBJECTIVE: We aim to describe the medical activities initiated and difficulties in implementing quarantine on a cruise ship. METHODS: Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests for SARS-CoV-2 were performed for all 3711 people (2666 passengers and 1045 crew) on board. RESULTS: Of those tested, 696 (18.8%) tested positive for coronavirus disease (COVID-19), of which 410 (58.9%) were asymptomatic. We also confirmed that 54% of the asymptomatic patients with a positive RT-PCR result had lung opacities on chest computed tomography. There were many difficulties in implementing quarantine, such as creating a dividing traffic line between infectious and noninfectious passengers, finding hospitals and transportation providers willing to accept these patients, transporting individuals, language barriers, and supporting daily life. As of March 8, 2020, 31 patients (4.5% of patients with positive RT-PCR results) were hospitalized and required ventilator support or intensive care, and 7 patients (1.0% of patients with positive RT-PCR results) had died. CONCLUSIONS: There were several difficulties in implementing large-scale quarantine and obtaining medical support on the cruise ship. In the future, we need to prepare for patients' transfer and the admitting hospitals when disembarking the passengers. We recommend treating the crew the same way as the passengers to control the infection. We must also draw a plan for the future, to protect travelers and passengers from emerging infectious diseases on cruise ships.","Yamahata, Yoshihiro; Shibata, Ayako",JMIR Public Health Surveill,425,26

In this study, we aimed to investigate the time courses of the anti-severe acute corona respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) IgM and IgG titers and to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of such tests according to the specific day after the onset of COVID-19 among a patient population in Japan. We measured the titers of SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG in sera from 105 subjects, including 26 symptomatic COVID-19 patients, using chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA) methods utilizing magnetic beads coated with SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein and spike protein. The results of a ROC analysis suggested the possibility that the cutoff values in Japan might be lower than the manufacturer's reported cutoff (10 AU/mL): 1 AU/mL for IgM and 5 AU/mL for IgG. The sensitivity of the test before Day 8 after symptom onset was less than 50%; at Days 9-10, however, we obtained a much higher sensitivity of 81.8% for both IgM and IgG. At 15 days or later after symptom onset, the SARS-CoV-2 IgG test had a sensitivity of 100%. These results suggest that if the number of days since disease onset is taken into consideration, these antibody tests could be very useful for the diagnosis of COVID-19 and similar diseases.","Nakano, Yuki; Kurano, Makoto; Morita, Yoshifumi; Shimura, Takuya; Yokoyama, Rin; Qian, Chungen; Xia, Fuzhen; He, Fan; Kishi, Yoshiro; Okada, Jun; Yoshikawa, Naoyuki; Nagura, Yutaka; Okazaki, Hitoshi; Moriya, Kyoji; Seto, Yasuyuki; Kodama, Tatsuhiko; Yatomi, Yutaka",Sci Rep,425,16

Seroconversion rates in unexposed subjects after the first and second doses were 40% and 100%, respectively, showing a significant increase in antibody concentrations from dose 1 to dose 2 (p<0.0001). The highest antibody concentrations were found in younger subjects and women, remaining significantly associated in a multivariable linear regression model (p=0.005). A single dose of the BBIBP-CorV vaccine induced a strong antibody response in individuals with prior SARS-CoV-2infection, while a second dose did not increase this response. A sharp increase in antibody concentrations was observed following SARS-CoV-2 infection in those participants who became infected after the first and second doses (p=0.008). Individuals with SARS-CoV-2 exposure prior to vaccination showed significantly higher anti-spike IgG antibody levels, at all-time points, than those not exposed (p<0.001). Higher antibody titers were induced by a single dose in previously SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals than those induced in naive subjects by two doses of the vaccine (p<0.0001). Three months after the second dose both groups showed a decline in antibody levels, being more abrupt in unexposed subjects. Overall, our results showed a trend towards lower antibody concentrations over time following BBIBP-CorV vaccination. Sex and age seem to influence the magnitude of the humoral response in unexposed subjects while the combination of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 plus vaccination, whatever the sequence of the events was, produced a sharp increase in antibody levels. Evaluation of the humoral responses over time and the analysis of the induction and persistence of memory B and T cell responses, are needed to assess long-term immune protection induced by BBIBP-CorV vaccine.","Badano, Maria Noel; Sabbione, Florencia; Keitelman, Irene; Pereson, Matias Javier; Aloisi, Natalia; Colado, Ana; Ramos, Victoria; Wilczynski, Juan Manuel Ortiz; Pozner, Roberto; Castillo, Luis; Wigdorovitz, Georgina; Bracco, Maria M E de; Fink, Susana; Chuit, Roberto; Bare, Patricia",,425,16

Research limitations/implications: Twitter played many positive roles, mainly through unofficial tweets. Users shared social distancing information, helped build support for social distancing, criticised government responses, expressed support for key workers, and helped each other to cope with social isolation. A few popular tweets not supporting social distancing show that government messages sometimes failed. Practical implications: Public health campaigns in future may consider encouraging grass roots social web activity to support campaign goals. At a methodological level, analysing retweet counts emphasised politics and ignored practical implementation issues.

We aimed to estimate the seroprevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in daycare centres that remained open for key workers' children during a nationwide lockdown in France. METHODS: Children and staff who attended one of 22 daycare centres during a nationwide lockdown in France (between March 15 and May 9, 2020) were included in this cross-sectional, multicentre, seroprevalence study. Hospital staff not occupationally exposed to patients with COVID-19, or to children, were enrolled in a comparator group. The primary outcome was SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in children, daycare centre staff, and the comparator group. The presence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in capillary whole blood was measured with a rapid chromatographic immunoassay. We computed raw prevalence as the percentage of individuals with a positive IgG or IgM test, and used Bayesian smoothing to account for imperfect sensitivity and specificity of the assay. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04413968. FINDINGS: Between June 4 and July 3, 2020, we enrolled 327 children (mean age 1·9 [SD 0·9] years; range 5 months to 4·4 years), 197 daycare centre staff (mean age 40 [12] years), and 164 adults in the comparator group (42 [12] years). Positive serological tests were observed for 14 children (raw seroprevalence 4·3%; 95% CI 2·6-7·1) and 14 daycare centre staff (7·7%; 4·2-11·6). After accounting for imperfect sensitivity and specificity of the assay, we estimated that 3·7% (95% credible interval [95% CrI] 1·3-6·8) of the children and 6·8% (3·2-11·5) of daycare centre staff had SARS-CoV-2 infection. The comparator group fared similarly to the daycare centre staff; nine participants had a positive serological test (raw seroprevalence 5·5%; 95% CI 2·9-10·1), leading to a seroprevalence of 5·0% (95% CrI 1·6-9·8) after accounting for assay characteristics. An exploratory analysis suggested that seropositive children were more likely than seronegative children to have been exposed to an adult household member with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 (six [43%] of 14 vs 19 [6%] of 307; relative risk 7·1 [95% CI 2·2-22·4]). INTERPRETATION: According to serological test results, the proportion of young children in our sample with SARS-CoV-2 infection was low. Intrafamily transmission seemed more plausible than transmission within daycare centres. Further epidemiological studies are needed to confirm this exploratory hypothesis.

METHOD: We undertook a retrospective study based on 347 COVID-19 patients (21 vs. 326 with vs. without chronic HBV infection). With the propensity score matching (PSM) method, we yielded 20 and 51 matched patients for the HBV group and the non-HBV group, respectively. RESULTS: At the end of follow-up, all of these 71 patients achieved SARS-CoV-2 clearance (P = 0.1). During the follow-up, 30% versus 31.4% in the HBV group versus non-HBV group progressed to severe COVID-19 (P = 0.97). After PSM, the longitudinal changes of median values for liver biochemistries were not significantly different between the two groups. In the HBV group versus non-HBV group, 35% (7/20) versus 37.25% (19/51) (P = 0.86) had abnormal alanine aminotransferase at least once during hospitalization, 30% (6/20) versus 31.37% (16/51) had abnormal aspartate aminotransferase (P = 0.91), 40% (8/20) versus 37.25% (19/51) had abnormal Î³-glutamyltransferase (P = 0.83), and 45% (9/20) versus 39.22% (20/51) had abnormal total bilirubin levels (P = 0.91). Moreover, three patients in the HBV group had hepatitis B reactivation. CONCLUSIONS: Liver dysfunction presented in COVID-19 patients with/without chronic HBV. Moreover, those COVID-19 patients co-infected with chronic HBV could have a risk of hepatitis B reactivation. It is necessary to monitor liver function of COVID-19 patients, as well as HBV-DNA levels for those co-infected with HBV during the whole disease course.","Liu, Jiaye; Wang, Tingyan; Cai, Qingxian; Sun, Liqin; Huang, Deliang; Zhou, Guangde; He, Qing; Wang, Fu-Sheng; Liu, Lei; Chen, Jun",Hepatol. res,425,26

AREAS COVERED: The PUBMED database was searched 2016-2020. The clinical manifestation of SAE is delirium, SE additionally is characterized by focal neurological symptoms. SAE is caused by inflammation with endothelial/microglial activation, increase of permeability of the blood-brain-barrier, hypoxia, imbalance of neurotransmitters, glial activation, axonal and neuronal loss. Septic-embolic (SEE) and septic-metastatic encephalitis (SME) are characterized by focal ischemia (SEE) and small abscesses (SME). The continuum between SAE, SME and SEE is documented by imaging techniques and autopsies. The backbone of treatment is rapid optimum antibiotic therapy. Experimental approaches focus on modulation of inflammation, stabilization of the blood-brain barrier and restoration of membrane/mitochondrial function. EXPERT OPINION: The most promising diagnostic approaches are new imaging techniques. The most important measure to fight delirium remains establishment of daily structure and adequate sensory stimuli. Dexmedetomidine and melatonin appear to reduce the frequency of delirium, their efficacy in SAE and SE remains to be established. Drugs already licensed for other indications or available as food supplements which may be effective in SAE are statins, L-DOPA/benserazide, ß-hydroxybutyrate, palmitoylethanolamide and tetracyclines or other bactericidal non-lytic antibiotics.","Tauber, Simone C; Djukic, Marija; Gossner, Johannes; Eiffert, Helmut; Brück, Wolfgang; Nau, Roland",,425,26

Improved understanding and new strategies to cope with novel coronaviruses are urgently needed. Viruses (especially RNA viruses) encode a limited number and size (length of polypeptide chain) of viral proteins and must interact with the host cell components to control (hijack) the host cell machinery. To achieve this goal, the extensive mimicry of SLiMs in host proteins provides an effective strategy. However, little is known regarding SLiMs in coronavirus proteins and their potential targets in host cells. The objective of this study is to uncover SLiMs in coronavirus proteins that are present within host cells. These SLiMs have a high possibility of interacting with host intracellular proteins and hijacking the host cell machinery for virus replication and dissemination. In total, 1,479 SLiM hits were identified in the 16 proteins of 590 coronaviruses infecting humans. Overall, 106 host proteins were identified that may interact with SLiMs in 16 coronavirus proteins. These SLiM-interacting proteins are composed of many intracellular key regulators, such as receptors, transcription factors and kinases, and may have important contributions to virus replication, immune evasion and viral pathogenesis. A total of 209 pathways containing proteins that may interact with SLiMs in coronavirus proteins were identified. This study uncovers potential mechanisms by which coronaviruses hijack the host cell machinery. These results provide potential therapeutic targets for viral infections.","Yang, ChuWen Shi ZhiLing",PLoS ONE,425,1

The strategies based on non-pharmaceutical interventions that were used to contain the outbreak in China appear to be effective2, but quantitative research is still needed to assess the efficacy of non-pharmaceutical interventions and their timings3. Here, using epidemiological data on COVID-19 and anonymized data on human movement4,5, we develop a modelling framework that uses daily travel networks to simulate different outbreak and intervention scenarios across China. We estimate that there were a total of 114,325 cases of COVID-19 (interquartile range 76,776-164,576) in mainland China as of 29 February 2020. Without non-pharmaceutical interventions, we predict that the number of cases would have been 67-fold higher (interquartile range 44-94-fold) by 29 February 2020, and we find that the effectiveness of different interventions varied. We estimate that early detection and isolation of cases prevented more infections than did travel restrictions and contact reductions, but that a combination of non-pharmaceutical interventions achieved the strongest and most rapid effect. According to our model, the lifting of travel restrictions from 17 February 2020 does not lead to an increase in cases across China if social distancing interventions can be maintained, even at a limited level of an on average 25% reduction in contact between individuals that continues until late April. These findings improve our understanding of the effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions on COVID-19, and will inform response efforts across the world.","Lai, Shengjie; Ruktanonchai, Nick W; Zhou, Liangcai; Prosper, Olivia; Luo, Wei; Floyd, Jessica R; Wesolowski, Amy; Santillana, Mauricio; Zhang, Chi; Du, Xiangjun; Yu, Hongjie; Tatem, Andrew J",Nature,425,3

METHOD: The chest CT images of COVID-19 patients were evaluated for the PSS as the ratio of the volume of involved lung parenchyma to the total lung volume. The cross-sectional areas of the pectoralis muscles (PMA, cm2) were also measured automatically on axial CT images, and PMI was calculated as the following formula: PMIâ¯=â¯PMA / patient's height square (m2).

To gain an understanding of the evolution of the newly emerging SARS-CoV-2, we herein analyzed the codon usage pattern of SARS-CoV-2. For this purpose, we compared the codon usage of SARS-CoV-2 with that of other viruses belonging to the subfamily of Orthocoronavirinae. We found that SARS-CoV-2 has a high AU content that strongly influences its codon usage, which appears to be better adapted to the human host. We also studied the evolutionary pressures that influence the codon usage of five conserved coronavirus genes encoding the viral replicase, spike, envelope, membrane and nucleocapsid proteins. We found different patterns of both mutational bias and natural selection that affect the codon usage of these genes. Moreover, we show here that the two integral membrane proteins (matrix and envelope) tend to evolve slowly by accumulating nucleotide mutations on their corresponding genes. Conversely, genes encoding nucleocapsid (N), viral replicase and spike proteins (S), although they are regarded as are important targets for the development of vaccines and antiviral drugs, tend to evolve faster in comparison to the two genes mentioned above. Overall, our results suggest that the higher divergence observed for the latter three genes could represent a significant barrier in the development of antiviral therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2.","Dilucca, Maddalena; Forcelloni, Sergio; Georgakilas, Alexandros G; Giansanti, Andrea; Pavlopoulou, Athanasia",Viruses,425,7

Importantly, up to 25% of the population in western countries is susceptible of suffering from both MAFLD and COVID-19, while none approved treatment is currently available for any of them. Moreover, it is well known that exacerbated innate immune responses are key in the development of the most severe stages of MAFLD and COVID-19. In this review, we focus on the role of the immune system in the establishment and progression of MAFLD and discuss its potential implication in the development of severe COVID-19 in MAFLD patients.

Little was known about the impact of these changes on childbearing women. AIM: To describe childbearing women's experiences of becoming a mother during the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia. METHODS: A qualitative exploratory design using semi-structured interviews was used. Women were recruited through social media and self-nominated to participate in an interview. Maximum variation sampling was used. A total of 27 interviews were conducted with women across Australia. Data were analysed thematically. FINDINGS: The thematic analysis resulted in four primary themes and ten sub-themes. The themes were 'going it alone - having a baby was an isolating experience' ('receiving maternity care alone', 'dealing with government restrictions', and 'desiring social support'), 'advocating for self or others' ('seeking reliable information', 'valuing peersupport', and 'having to be resourceful'), 'finding a way through' ('a changed experience for all', 'managing stress and anxiety', 'requiring constant adjustments', and 'managing fear mongering'), and 'keeping safe'. CONCLUSION: Becoming a mother during the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia was a profound experience for the women. Following the public health initiatives which resulted in physical distancing restrictions, isolation, and the need to provide and receive social and peer support were common experiences. Whilst public health initiatives are implemented to keep people safe, the social and emotional toll on childbearing women should be considered by healthcare professionals. Childbearing women need to be safe but also require support and reassurance.","Sweet, Linda; Bradfield, Zoe; Vasilevski, Vidanka; Wynter, Karen; Hauck, Yvonne; Kuliukas, Lesley; Homer, Caroline S E; Szabo, Rebecca A; Wilson, Alyce N",Midwifery,425,21

Since the virus was first identified in December 2019, the number of deaths have been propagating exponentially, causing countries across the world, including Malaysia, to increase emergency measures to combat the virus. Due to the fact that the COVID-19 pandemic does not discriminate its victims, it is of paramount importance to construct a plan for management of the dead for all suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases, including the unidentified deceased, as an essential portion of the humanitarian forensic action approach. This document provides an overview on ways to maximize the local collective capacity from various government agencies to manage the dead based on the prevailing regulations and legislation in the country, in preparation for possible large scale deaths from this pandemic. The National Institute of Forensic Medicine Malaysia has improvised procedures and guidelines for management of the dead within the existing regulations in order to achieve a balance between medicolegal requirements and the safety of personnel managing the bodies of the deceased with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection; at the site of death, during transport, during postmortem procedures, storage and preparation before and during burial or cremation as well as environmental cleaning and disinfection, involving various agencies in the country. A form of temporary controlled burial is as an option to allow the reinvestigation of a decedent to help formally identify victims of the pandemic such as undocumented migrants or refugees who were previously not identified. Due to the different legal requirements and mortality rates between countries, there is no one-size-fits-all approach to the management of the dead. Whenever possible, every opportunity and assistance must be given to families to mourn their loved ones, even in times of crisis or an outbreak, in order to sustain an appropriate level of dignity and respect.","Khoo, Lay See; Hasmi, Ahmad Hafizam; Ibrahim, Mohamad Azaini; Mahmood, Mohd Shah",Forensic Sci Med Pathol,425,24

Hence, this study was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CP in patients with chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis with moderate-to-severe SARS-CoV2 infection. METHODS: A prospective observational cohort study was conducted in consecutive 68 moderate-to-severe SARS-CoV2 infected patients who were on maintenance hemodialysis or with acute worsening of chronic kidney disease which required initiation of hemodialysis. Patients who received CP were compared with those who did not. The primary outcome was death during hospitalization. Clinical characteristics, duration of hospitalization and inflammatory parameters were compared between the two groups. A subgroup analysis was done to find whether early initiation of plasma was associated with better outcome. RESULTS: Sixteen patients (44%) in the plasma group and 14 (45%) patients in the control group died during hospitalization (p = 0.95). The median duration of hospitalization was 9 (6-14) days in the plasma group and 9 (6-16) in the control group (p = 0.60). There was no difference in mortality or duration of hospitalization with respect to early initiation of CP (p = 0.29). Fistula thrombosis occurred in two patients (11.1%) in the plasma group.

Some amino acids share structural similarities while others vary considerably. These structures determine the chemical and physical properties of amino acids. Grouping amino acids with similar structures potentially improves the ability to identify structurally conserved regions and increases the global structural similarity between proteins. We systematically studied the effects of amino acid grouping on the numbers of Specific/specific, Common/common, and statistically different keys to achieve a better understanding of protein structure relations. Common keys represent substructures found in all types of proteins and Specific keys represent substructures exclusively belonging to a certain type of proteins in a data set. Our results show that applying amino acid grouping to the Triangular Spatial Relationship (TSR)-based method, while computing structural similarity among proteins, improves the accuracy of protein clustering in certain cases. In addition, applying amino acid grouping facilitates the process of identification or discovery of conserved structural motifs. The results from the principal component analysis (PCA) demonstrate that applying amino acid grouping captures slightly more structural variation than when amino acid grouping is not used, indicating that amino acid grouping reduces structure diversity as predicted. The TSR-based method uniquely identifies and discovers binding sites for drugs or interacting proteins. The binding sites of nsp16 of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV that we have defined will aid future antiviral drug design for improving therapeutic outcome. This approach for incorporating the amino acid grouping feature into our structural comparison method is promising and provides a deeper insight into understanding of structural relations of proteins.","Sarkar, Titli; Raghavan, Vijay V; Chen, Feng; Riley, Andrew; Zhou, Sophia; Xu, Wu",Comput Biol Chem,425,26

Based on in vitro data, IVM has recently been proposed for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 infection, a condition for which obesity is a major risk factor. In patients, IVM dosage is based on total body weight and there are no recommendations to adjust dosage in obese patients. The objective of this study was to establish, in a canine model, the influence of obesity on the clearance and steady-state volume of distribution of IVM, MOX, and a third analog, eprinomectin (EPR). An experimental model of obesity in dogs was based on a high calorie diet. IVM, MOX, and EPR were administered intravenously, in combination, to a single group of dogs in two circumstances, during a control period and when body weight had been increased by 50%. In obese dogs, clearance, expressed in absolute values (L/day), was not modified for MOX but was reduced for IVM and EPR, compared to the initial control state. However, when scaled by body weight (L/day/kg), plasma clearance was reduced by 55, 42, and 63%, for IVM, MOX and EPR, respectively. In contrast, the steady-state volume of distribution was markedly increased, in absolute values (L), by obesity. For IVM and MOX, this obese dog model suggests that the maintenance doses in the obese subject should be based on lean body weight rather than total weight. On the other hand, the loading dose, when required, should be based on the total body weight of the obese subject.","Bousquet-Melou, A.; Lespine, A.; Sutra, J. F.; Bargues, I.; Toutain, P.

These measures have been associated with reduced incidence of other respiratory illnesses such as influenza. It is currently unclear what effect these measures have on non-respiratory communicable diseases. The incidence of notifiable non-respiratory communicable diseases within the NT, from 15 March to 15 May 2020, the period of most restrictive physical distancing, was monitored and is here compared with two control periods: (i) the 4 months immediately prior and (ii) the same two-month period from the preceding 5 years. During the study period, there was a decline in incidence of communicable enteric illnesses, particularly in shigellosis and rotavirus where person-to-person spread is the main transmission route. There was an increase in chlamydial conjunctivitis in areas with endemic trachoma, which is under further investigation. There was no observed increase in conditions associated with crowding, such as those related to group A streptococcal infection.","Xie, Ouli; Markey, Peter G; Draper, Anthony D K; Krause, Vicki L",,425,30

It is characterized by deficient or dysfunctional CalDAG-GEFI protein. The distinctive feature of the disease is impaired platelet aggregation in response to multiple physiologic agonists. We here report a family with a platelet-type bleeding disorder and a novel mutation in the RASGRP2 gene. The overall bleeding score for the affected individuals was 15 and 12. Based on the initial diagnosis of Glanzmann thrombasthenia, targeted sequencing of integrin subunit alpha 2b and integrin subunit beta 3 encoding genes ITGA2B and ITGB3 were carried out in both affected members of a family. Sequence alignment failed to identify the disease-causing variant(s) in both genes. Therefore, whole exome sequencing in one affected individual was performed. Data analysis detected a novel homozygous missense variant (c.956C>T; p.Pro319Leu) in the exon 9 of the RASGRP2 gene. Five additional individuals of a family including both parents, an affected individual and two asymptomatic individuals were Sanger sequenced for the variant (c.956C>T). The variant segregates in the family in an autosomal recessive manner. Several in silico tools predicted the variant as pathogenic. Protein modeling studies suggest that the mutation (p.Pro319Leu) cause a conformational change in the loop structure of the RasGEF domain of the CalDAG-GEFI protein. Reported variants in the RasGEF domain impair expression and/or nucleotide exchange activity of CalDAG-GEFI protein and thus inhibit the activation of Rap1 protein required for platelet adhesion and hemostatic plug formation.","Alharby, Essa; Bakhsh, Mohammad A; Albalawi, Alia M; Almutairi, Sultan O; Hashmi, Jamil A; Basit, Sulman",Platelets,425,15

Due to the great demand for effective COVID-19 testing programmes to control the spread of the disease, we have suggested such a testing programme that includes a rapid RT-qPCR approach without RNA extraction. The Direct-One-Step-RT-qPCR (DIOS-RT-qPCR) assay detects severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in less than one hour while maintaining the high sensitivity and specificity required of diagnostic tools. This optimised protocol allows for the direct use of swab transfer media (14 µL) without the need for RNA extraction, achieving comparable sensitivity to the standard method that requires the time-consuming and costly step of RNA isolation. The limit of detection for DIOS-RT-qPCR was lower than seven copies/reaction, which translates to 550 virus copies/mL of swab. The speed, ease of use and low price of this assay make it suitable for high-throughput screening programmes. The use of fast enzymes allows RT-qPCR to be performed under standard laboratory conditions within one hour, making it a potential point-of-care solution on high-speed cycling instruments. This protocol also implements the heat inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 (75 °C for 10 min), which renders samples non-infectious, enabling testing in BSL-2 facilities. Moreover, we discuss the critical steps involved in developing tests for the rapid detection of COVID-19. Implementing rapid, easy, cost-effective methods can help control the worldwide spread of the COVID-19 infection.","Kriegova, Eva; Fillerova, Regina; Kvapil, Petr",,425,1

Changes in genetic material can be evidenced by the frequency of nuclear abnormalities in fish blood cells, in response to genotoxic agents even at low concentrations. Thus, we aimed at comparing the frequencies of nuclear abnormalities of fish kept in acclimation, with fish collected in Timbó river (Santa Cruz do Timbó, Santa Catarina State), under low anthropogenic interference, and fish collected in Iguaçu river (União da Vitória, Paraná State), a polluted river. The highest frequency of changes in nuclear morphology of fish erythrocytes was found in the urbanized area around the Iguaçu river, while, the fish collected in areas with preserved riparian forest surrounding the Timbó river and acclimated fish showed no morphological changes. Our results suggest that genotoxic compounds in the Iguaçu river are acting as stressors to aquatic communities, especially fish. In addition, the absence of nuclear abnormalities in fish from the Timbó river suggests that rivers without significant environmental changes can serve as reference point for comparative studies of genetic modifications for the species studied.(AU)","Melo-Silva, Merieli; Oliveira, Felipe Rafael; Rosa, Jonathan; Gemelli, Emanuelli; Santos, Lilian; Bueno-Krawczyk, Ana Carolina de Deus",Acta Sci.

Yet, the incidence of PA in the general population has not been studied. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the incidence of PA in the general population. DESIGN AND METHODS: Patients who had received a diagnostic code for PA between 1987 and 2016 were identified in the Swedish National Patient Registry. Assessment of clinical and biochemical data was used to validate the diagnosis. The annual incidence of PA was calculated by using the number of inhabitants in the Västra Götaland County as reference. RESULTS: Of 570 identified patients, 473 (83 %) had confirmed PA. Eligible for the incidence analysis were 416 patients, 248 (60%) men and 168 (40%) women, diagnosed with PA between 1987-2016. The mean (±standard deviation) age at diagnosis was 56±12 years. The median (interquartile range) annual incidence was 2 (1-2) cases per million between 1987 and 1996, 6 (4-9) cases per million between 1997 and 2006 and 17 (12-24) cases per million between 2007 and 2016. At the end of the study (December 31 st 2016), 386 patients with confirmed PA were alive and living in the Västra Götaland County, giving a prevalence of 231 cases per million (0.022%). CONCLUSIONS: Despite increasing incidence, the proportion of patients identified with PA is lower than expected. Given the serious consequences of untreated PA, the noticeably low prevalence at the end of the study stresses the need to increase the awareness of PA among health care providers.","Gkaniatsa, Eleftheria; Ekerstad, Eva; Gavric, Manuela; Muth, Andreas; Trimpou, Penelope; Olsson, Daniel S; Johannsson, Gudmundur; Ragnarsson, Oskar",J. clin. endocrinol. metab,425,1

Here we describe the durability and broad-spectrum VOC immunity of a prefusion-stabilized spike (S) protein adjuvanted with liquid or lyophilized CoVaccine HT in cynomolgus macaques. This recombinant subunit vaccine is highly immunogenic and induces robust spike-specific and broadly neutralizing antibody responses effective against circulating VOCs (B.1.351 [Beta], P.1 [Gamma], B.1.617 [Delta]) for at least 3 months after the final boost. Protective efficacy and post-exposure immunity were evaluated using a heterologous P.1 challenge nearly 3 months after the last immunization. Our results indicate that while immunization with both high and low S doses shorten and reduce viral loads in the upper and lower respiratory tract, a higher antigen dose is required to provide durable protection against disease as vaccine immunity wanes. Histologically, P.1 infection causes similar COVID-19-like lung pathology as seen with early pandemic isolates. Post-challenge IgG concentrations were restored to peak immunity levels and vaccine-matched and cross-variant neutralizing antibodies were significantly elevated in immunized macaques indicating an efficient anamnestic response. Only low levels of P.1-specific neutralizing antibodies with limited breadth were observed in control (non-vaccinated but challenged) macaques suggesting that natural infection may not prevent reinfection by other VOCs. Overall, these results demonstrate that a properly dosed and adjuvanted recombinant subunit vaccine can provide long-lasting and protective immunity against circulating VOCs.

METHODS: An online survey was run from February 19 to March 6, 2020; a total of 2,182 Chinese subjects participated. Mental health variables were assessed via the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), the Symptom Check List-revised (SCL-90-R), and the Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4), which included a 2-item anxiety scale and a 2-item depression scale (PHQ-2). RESULTS: Compared with nonmedical health workers (n = 1,255), medical health workers (n = 927) had a higher prevalence of insomnia (38.4 vs. 30.5%, p < 0.01), anxiety (13.0 vs. 8.5%, p < 0.01), depression (12.2 vs. 9.5%; p< 0.04), somatization (1.6 vs. 0.4%; p < 0.01), and obsessive-compulsive symptoms (5.3 vs. 2.2%; p < 0.01). They also had higher total scores of ISI, GAD-2, PHQ-2, and SCL-90-R obsessive-compulsive symptoms (p &#8804; 0.01). Among medical health workers, having organic disease was an independent factor for insomnia, anxiety, depression, somatization, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms (p < 0.05 or 0.01).

We hypothesized that two-dimensional (2D) speckle-tracking assessment of LV global longitudinal strain (GLS) and RV free wall strain (FWS) by transthoracic echocardiography can assist as markers for subclinical cardiac injury predicting increased mortality. Methods: We performed 2D strain analysis via proprietary software in 48 patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Clinical information, demographics, comorbidities, and lab values were collected via retrospective chart review. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality based on an optimized abnormal LV GLS value via ROC analysis and RV FWS. Results: The optimal LV GLS cutoff to predict death was -13.8%, with a sensitivity of 85% (95% CI 55-98%) and specificity of 54% (95% CI 36-71%). Abnormal LV GLSâ¯>â¯-13.8% was associated with a higher risk of death [unadjusted hazard ratio 5.15 (95% CI 1.13-23.45), pâ¯=â¯0.034], which persisted after adjustment for clinical variables.

Conclusion: Abnormal LV strain with a cutoff of >-13.8% in patients with COVID-19 is associated with significantly higher risk of death.

Despite a lack of robust evidence to support the use of HCQ for treatment of COVID-19, it was publicly endorsed and received widespread media coverage and public interest. The purpose of this report is to describe and contextualize the surges in public interest, demand, and adoption of HCQ for treatment of COVID-19 and outline implications for future public health policy and practice. METHODS: Using national and global events and Google Trends data as a measure of public interest, we describe the timeline and trends in the emergence of, interest in, and adoption of HCQ as a treatment of COVID-19. We additionally review reports on public demand for HCQ for treatment of COVID-19 and impacts on medication access among patients with indicated uses. RESULTS: Public interest and demand for HCQ surged in the United States and globally following endorsements from public officials and enaction of policies to facilitate off-label use of HCQ for treatment of COVID-19. Surges in demand for HCQ led to multiple documented shortages and barriers to accessing HCQ treatment for patients with indicated uses for HCQ. Although there have been reversals in policies to support HCQ use for treatment of COVID-19 in some regions, others have continued or expanded recommended uses. CONCLUSION: Insights from the global response to HCQ and COVID-19 can be used to inform prudent decision-making in the future to prevent premature action and promote informed and equitable responses to promote public health.","Englund, Tessa R; Kinlaw, Alan C; Sheikh, Saira Z",,425,5

This mixed methods study explores how PHT applies to the career paths of a clinical anatomy (CA) postgraduate cohort. It provides insight into educational practices designed to equip students for labor markets inside and outside academia. Alumni of CA (n = 12; 2014-2018) were interviewed about career-related events transpiring from graduate studies to present, allowing exploration on how PHT contextualizes their shared experiences. Planned happenstance career inventory (PHCI) enumerated planned happenstance skill (PHS) scores. Total PHS was referenced 527 times across 12 interviews. Of the PHS references, curiosity established highest incidence (154 references, 29%), optimism (132 references, 25%), flexibility (101 references, 19%), risk-taking (85 references, 16%), and persistence (55 references, 10%) and 43 distinct happenstance events were documented. In addition, social networking (52 references) arose as an emergent code and was divided into internal networking (28 references, 54%) and external networking (24 references, 46%). Application of the five-point PHCI scale revealed: curiosity (4.4 ± 0.3; mean ± SD), flexibility (3.6 ± 0.7), persistence (4.4 ± 0.3), optimism (4.3 ± 0.4), and risk-taking (4.1 ± 0.5). Curiosity had the strongest association with happenstance event incidence. Social networking was a key substituent of PHT not yet described in the literature. Educational practices incorporating PHT concepts, with emphasis on curiosity, may provide graduates novel metacognitive skills needed to develop novel career paths.","Bazos, Ethan; Attardi, Stefanie M; Baytor, Jennifer; Wilson, Timothy D",,425,24

With disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) commonly used for RRMS accepted to be less efficacious once progression has occurred, treatment options for progressive forms of MS have been limited. Emergence of new DMTs in SPMS are changing the treatment landscape. There is a need to better understand current practice and the factors underlying it, to facilitate consensus on the overall management of SPMS and optimise diagnostic and management decisions. This survey project aimed to assess current practices for the diagnosis and management of patients with SPMS in the UK. METHODS: Healthcare professionals (HCPs) involved in the management of patients with SPMS from geographically distributed MS neurology centres in the UK participated in face-to-face or telephone interviews, facilitated by a semi-structured questionnaire. The survey data were descriptively analysed using quantitative and qualitative methods. RESULTS: Fifty-nine HCPs (41 neurologists, 15 specialist nurses and 3 'other'), from 59 UK centres took part. Sixty-one percent (n = 36/59) of respondents applied a specific definition for SPMS, although only 6% of these (2/36) used the Lublin 2014 phenotype criteria. Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score increase with an absence of relapses was an important consideration for SPMS diagnosis for 83% (n = 49/59) of respondents, and 36% (n = 21/59) considered this to be the most important piece of evidence that they look for when they suspect a patient is transitioning from RRMS to SPMS. The median (interquartile range [IQR]) estimated time between first suspicion and diagnosis of SPMS was 12 months (12-24 [n = 45/59]), with concerns over withdrawing DMTs and the psychological impact of a diagnosis on patients the most commonly reported reasons for reluctance to diagnose. Seventy-three percent (n = 43/59) of respondents followed specific guidelines for DMT management of patients transitioning from RRMS to SPMS, with most (86%, n = 37/43) using the NHS England algorithm. Ninety-eight percent (n = 58/59) use DMTs to treat patients they suspect may be transitioning to SPMS, and 51% (n = 30/59) reported using DMTs for newly diagnosed SPMS patients. Approximately 1 in 5 HCPs may consider continuing DMTs beyond EDSS 7.0 in certain circumstances. CONCLUSION: The survey highlighted variation across the UK in SPMS definition, diagnosis and reported real-world management. Disparity in practice may result in unnecessary variations in treatment patterns and consequently outcomes. HCPs should be equipped to make timely and accurate decisions, which will be important in improving access to appropriate therapies for patients with SPMS.","Duddy, Martin; Wilkinson, Carmel; Medhurst, Steve; Rhys, Katherine",Mult Scler Relat Disord,425,1

Although there appear to be several early predictors of outcome, there are no currently validated prognostic models or scoring systems applicable specifically to patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2. OBJECTIVE: We aim to create a point-of-admission mortality risk scoring system using an artificial neural network (ANN). METHODS: We present an ANN that can provide a patient-specific, point-of-admission mortality risk prediction to inform clinical management decisions at the earliest opportunity. The ANN analyzes a set of patient features including demographics, comorbidities, smoking history, and presenting symptoms and predicts patient-specific mortality risk during the current hospital admission. The model was trained and validated on data extracted from 398 patients admitted to hospital with a positive real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: Patient-specific mortality was predicted with 86.25% accuracy, with a sensitivity of 87.50% (95% CI 61.65%-98.45%) and specificity of 85.94% (95% CI 74.98%-93.36%). The positive predictive value was 60.87% (95% CI 45.23%-74.56%), and the negative predictive value was 96.49% (95% CI 88.23%-99.02%). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 90.12%. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis demonstrates an adaptive ANN trained on data at a single site, which demonstrates the early utility of deep learning approaches in a rapidly evolving pandemic with no established or validated prognostic scoring systems.","Abdulaal, Ahmed; Patel, Aatish; Charani, Esmita; Denny, Sarah; Mughal, Nabeela; Moore, Luke",J Med Internet Res,425,26

To date, some aspects remain to be investigate about the pathophysiology of this viral infection. One of the aspects to be still clarified is the correlation between the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and SARS-CoV-2 infection. RAS is a physiological system playing a key role in different human body functions regulation. SARS-CoV-2 uses the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2), a component of RAS, as a potential factor of cell penetration and infectivity; in addition, in the different infection stages, a functional variation of the RAS has been noted. In this article, we discuss the correlation between the role of RAS and system-modifying agents, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) and direct renin inhibitors (DRIs), with SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Vitiello, Antonio; Ferrara, Francesco",Eur J Pharmacol,425,20

The effects of the crisis on the retail sector resulted in many brands deferring or cancelling orders from supplier factories without paying workers, which had an instant and calamitous impact on the lives of garment workers in the global South. While activist organizations were quick to launch campaigns demanding that fashion brands #PayUp and take responsibility for their producers, these calls seemed futile in the face of fashion supply chains that have long been structured in ways that absolve brands of responsibility. The stories of worker exploitation and abuse in the garment industry that emerged during the pandemic were not discussed as effects of global capitalism, but rather were recast as evidence of a world suddenly in ‘crisis.’ In this article, we reflect on how the language of ‘crisis’ adopted in the early months of the pandemic produced particular modes and instruments of (ir)responsibility. We present an analysis of the effects of the pandemic on the global fashion industry, as well as the #PayUp and #WeWearAustralian campaigns, and argue that the exceptionalism underpinning the crisis discourse has both diffused and narrowed responsibility for garment worker exploitation, reiterating the very racialised inequalities that allow such exploitation to occur in the first place.","Khan, Rimi Richards Harriette",Cultural Studies,425,0

Many plus-strand RNA viruses employ largescale intra-genomic RNA-RNA interactions as a means to control viral processes. Here, we describe an elaborate RNA structure formed by multiple distant regions in a tombusvirus genome that activates transcription of a viral subgenomic mRNA. The initial step in assembly of this intramolecular RNA complex involves the folding of a large viral RNA domain, which generates a discontinuous binding pocket. Next, a distally-located protracted stem-loop RNA structure docks, via base-pairing, into the binding site and acts as a linchpin that stabilizes the RNA complex and activates transcription. A multi-step RNA folding pathway is proposed in which rate-limiting steps contribute to a delay in transcription of the capsid protein-encoding viral subgenomic mRNA. This study provides an exceptional example of the complexity of genome-scale viral regulation and offers new insights into the assembly schemes utilized by large intra-genomic RNA structures.","Chkuaseli, Tamari; White, K Andrew",Nucleic acids res,425,29

Given the results of previous research on PTSD in epidemic (e.g., SARS) survivors, we suggest that mental health professionals in countries touched by the pandemic should prepare for an increase in the PTSD prevalence, specifically in: individuals who have had severe COVID-19;family members of these patients and of patients who have died;and frontline healthcare workers witnessing COVID-19 patients' sudden deaths, or numerous life-threatening situations. We postulate that these groups at risk should be routinely screened for PTSD in primary medical and pediatric care.

In response, U.S. hospitals altered their care delivery systems, but there are few data regarding specific structural changes. Understanding these changes is important to guide interpretation of outcomes and inform pandemic preparedness. We sought to characterize emergency responses across hospitals in the United States over time and in the context of local case rates early in the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. DESIGN: We surveyed hospitals from a national acute care trials group regarding operational and structural changes made in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic from January to August 2020. We collected prepandemic characteristics and changes to hospital system, space, staffing, and equipment during the pandemic. We compared the timing of these changes with county-level coronavirus disease 2019 case rates. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: U.S. hospitals participating in the Prevention and Early Treatment of Acute Lung Injury Network Coronavirus Disease 2019 Observational study. Site investigators at each hospital collected local data. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Forty-five sites participated (94% response rate). System-level changes (incident command activation and elective procedure cancellation) occurred at nearly all sites, preceding rises in local case rates. The peak inpatient census during the pandemic was greater than the prior hospital bed capacity in 57% of sites with notable regional variation. Nearly half (49%) expanded ward capacity, and 63% expanded ICU capacity, with nearly all bed expansion achieved through repurposing of clinical spaces. Two-thirds of sites adapted staffing to care for patients with coronavirus disease 2019, with 48% implementing tiered staffing models, 49% adding temporary physicians, nurses, or respiratory therapists, and 30% changing the ratios of physicians or nurses to patients. CONCLUSIONS: The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic prompted widespread system-level changes, but front-line clinical care varied widely according to specific hospital needs and infrastructure. Linking operational changes to care delivery processes is a necessary step to understand the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic on patient outcomes.","Mathews, Kusum S; Seitz, Kevin P; Vranas, Kelly C; Duggal, Abhijit; Valley, Thomas S; Zhao, Bo; Gundel, Stephanie; Harhay, Michael O; Chang, Steven Y; Hough, Catherine L",Crit Care Med,425,24

This retrospective, multi-centre, noninterventional, case-control study identified patients with chronic hepatitis C virus infection initiating (control) or not initiating (case) treatment at 43 sites in Germany from September 2017 to June 2018. It aimed to compare characteristics of the two patient populations and to identify factors involved in patient/physician decision to initiate/not initiate chronic hepatitis C virus treatment, with a particular focus on historical barriers. Overall, 793 patients were identified: 573 (72%) who received treatment and 220 (28%) who did not. In 42% of patients, the reason for not initiating treatment was patient wish, particularly due to fear of treatment (17%) or adverse events (13%). Other frequently observed reasons for not initiating treatment were in accordance with known historical barriers for physicians to initiate therapy, including perceived or expected lack of compliance (14.5%), high patient age (10.9%), comorbidities (15.0%), alcohol abuse (9.1%), hard drug use (7.7%), and opioid substitution therapy (4.5%). Patient wish against therapy was also a frequently reported reason for not initiating treatment in the postponed (35.2%) and not planned (47.0%) subgroups; of note, known historical factors were also common reasons for postponing treatment. Real-world and clinical trial evidence is accumulating, which suggests that such historical barriers do not negatively impact treatment effectiveness.

Our inspection is motivated by the renormalization group (RG) framework. Here we propose the RG-inspired logistic function of the form αE(t)=a(1+e-c(t-{t0)-nas an epidemic strength function with n being asymmetry in the modified logistic function. We perform the non-linear least-squares analysis with data from various countries. The uncertainty for model parameters is computed using the squared root of the corresponding diagonal components of the covariance matrix. We carefully divide countries under consideration into 2 categories based on the estimation of the inflection point: the maturing phase and the growth-dominated phase. We observe that long-term estimations of cumulative infected cases of countries in the maturing phase for both n = 1 and nne 1are close to each other. We find from the value of root mean squared error (RMSE) that the RG-inspired logistic model with nne 1 is slightly preferable in this category. We also argue that n determines the characteristic of the epidemic at an early stage. However, in the second category, the estimated asymptotic number of cumulative infected cases contain rather large uncertainty. Therefore, in the growth-dominated phase, we focus on using n = 1 for countries in this phase. Some of them are in an early stage of an epidemic with an insufficient amount of data leading to a large uncertainty on parameter fits. In terms of the accuracy of the size estimation, the results do strongly depend on limitations on data collection and the epidemic phase for each country.","Pongkitivanichkul, Chakrit; Samart, Daris; Tangphati, Takol; Koomhin, Phanit; Pimton, Pimchanok; Dam-O, Punsiri; Payaka, Apirak; Channuie, Phongpichit",Phys Scr,425,5

Accordingly, in this study, an HIV-1 fusion inhibitor called Enfuvirtide (Enf) was selected. The affinity and essential residues involving in the Enf binding to the S2 protein of SARS-CoV-2, HIV-1 gp41 protein and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) as a negative control, was evaluated using molecular docking. Eventually, Enf-S2 and Enf-gp41 protein complexes were simulated by molecular dynamics (MD) in terms of binding affinity and stability. Based on the most important criteria such as docking score, cluster size, energy and dissociation constant, the strongest interaction was observed between Enf with the S2 protein. In addition, MD results confirmed that Enf-S2 protein interaction was remarkably stable and caused the S2 protein residues to undergo the fewest fluctuations. In conclusion, it can be stated that Enf can act as a strong SARS-CoV-2 fusion inhibitor and demonstrates the potential to enter the clinical trial phase of COVID-19. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Secondary HLH is always caused by autoimmune disease, infections, or cancer. The first-line therapy for secondary HLH is the HLH 2004 protocol, including dexamethasone, etoposide, and supportive therapy. However, up to 30% of patients, especially pediatric patients, remain unresponsive to first-line treatment, and the mortality rate reaches 50% in children with HLH. Furthermore, some children who have special conditions, such as an active virus infection, are not suitable for immunosuppressants treatment. Recently, several HLH-promoting cytokines have been identified, including interferon-Î³, interleukin-2, and interleukin-6. Janus kinase 1 and 2 control the signaling of many cytokines, notably interferon-Î³, interleukin-2, and interleukin-6. Janus kinase 1 and 2 inhibitors, such as ruxolitinib, have been successfully used to treat HLH in mice. Here, we report that a boy, diagnosed with HLH and high titer of hepatitis B virus-DNA copies, improved quickly, and the cytokine storm of HLH was alleviated after receiving ruxolitinib. Five days after ruxolitinib treatment, entecavir was introduced and serum titer results of hepatitis B virus-DNA returned negative. With 3 months of ruxolitinib treatment and following-up 1 year, the boy's situation maintained sustained remission. In this study, it is suggested that ruxolitinib might be a first-line drug, which could alleviate the cytokine storm of HLH. This treatment may be ushering in the age of glucocorticosteroid-free HLH treatment, which is particularly meaningful for children because it avoids the side effects of glucocorticosteroid.","Jianguo, Li; Zhixuan, Zhou; Rong, Liu; Xiaodong, Shi",Pediatrics,425,11

Therefore, this study aims to calculate the cost and extra length of stay (LOS) of neonatal BSI. A prospective case-control study was undertaken at the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) of Korle Bu Teaching Hospital (KBTH) in Ghana. METHODS: The clinical data of 357 neonates were prospectively analysed. Overall, 100 neonates with BSI and 100 control neonates without BSI were matched by weight, sex and type of delivery. The direct and indirect costs to neonates and their caregivers was obtained on a daily basis. The cost of drugs was confirmed with the Pharmacy Department at KBTH. A count data model, specifically negative binomial regression, was employed to estimate the extra LOS in the NICU due to neonatal BSI. The study analyzed the total, average and marginal costs of neonatal BSI for the case and control groups from the perspective of the patients/carers/providers. RESULTS: Fifty-four percent of the total sample were born with a low birth weight. Neonates with BSI recorded higher costs compared with neonates without BSI. The highest difference in direct costs was recorded among neonates with extremely low birth weight (US$732), which is 67% higher than similar neonates without BSI. The regression estimates show a significant correlation between neonatal BSI and LOS in the NICU (p < 0.001). Neonates with BSI stayed an additional 10 days in the NICU compared with their matched cohort. The LOS varies significantly depending on the neonate's weight at birth. The extra days range from 1 day for neonates defined as macrosomia to 15 extra days for extremely low birth weight neonates. CONCLUSIONS: Neonatal BSI was significantly associated with prolonged LOS. The continuous presence of experienced medical staff, as well as parents, to monitor newborns during their stay on the ward has enormous economic burden on both hospitals and caregivers.","Fenny, Ama Pokuaa; Otieku, Evans; Labi, Kwaku Appiah-Korang; Asante, Felix Ankomah; Enemark, Ulrika",,425,0

However, this method is not recommended in the current situation with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, because it requires face-to-face and short-distance work. To address this problem, we propose a measurable oral care simulator, where a single force sensor is installed at the bottom of the gum model. We developed a measurement algorithm for estimating the force and contact points of the brush from the force and moment measured by the force sensor. The proposed simulator can be used to practice oral care by oneself without any risk of infection. In addition, the efficiency of practice is expected to improve, because the proposed simulator can be used to objectively evaluate oral care skills. Furthermore, the gum model can be easily adjusted to practice various cases of oral care. Experiments were performed to validate the proposed oral care simulator with two gum models, a real gum model and a displayable gum model that shows the brushing results. The results confirmed that the proposed oral care simulator and algorithm accurately estimate the contact points as well as the normal and tangential forces of the brush with only one force sensor.

Primary AI (PAI) is rare and is caused by direct adrenal failure. Secondary AI (SAI) is more frequent and is caused by diseases affecting the pituitary, whereas in tertiary AI (TAI), the hypothalamus is affected. The most prevalent form is TAI owing to exogenous glucocorticoid use. Symptoms of AI are non-specific, often overlooked or misdiagnosed, and are related to the lack of cortisol, adrenal androgen precursors and aldosterone (especially in PAI). Diagnosis is based on measurement of the adrenal corticosteroid hormones, their regulatory peptide hormones and stimulation tests. The goal of therapy is to establish a hormone replacement regimen that closely mimics the physiological diurnal cortisol secretion pattern, tailored to the patient's daily needs. This Primer provides insights into the epidemiology, mechanisms and management of AI during pregnancy as well as challenges of long-term management. In addition, the importance of identifying life-threatening adrenal emergencies (acute AI and adrenal crisis) is highlighted and strategies for prevention, which include patient education, glucocorticoid emergency cards and injection kits, are described.","Hahner, Stefanie; Ross, Richard J; Arlt, Wiebke; Bancos, Irina; Burger-Stritt, Stephanie; Torpy, David J; Husebye, Eystein S; Quinkler, Marcus",Nat Rev Dis Primers,425,10

However, the literature on transmission routes and risk factors for COVID-19 in HCWs is limited. AIM: To examine the characteristics and transmission dynamics of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in HCWs in a university teaching hospital in London, UK. METHODS: Staff records and virology testing results were combined to identify staff sickness and COVID-19 rates from March to April 2020. Comparisons were made with staff professional groups, department of work, and ethnicity. FINDINGS: COVID-19 rates in our HCWs largely rose and declined in parallel with the number of community cases. White and non-White ethnic groups among our HCWs had similar rates of infection. Clinical staff had a higher rate of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 than non-clinical staff, but total sickness rates were similar. Doctors had the highest rate of infection, but took the fewest sickness days. Critical care had lower rates than the emergency department (ED), but rates in the ED declined when all staff were advised to use personal protective equipment (PPE). CONCLUSION: Sustained transmission of SARS-CoV-2 among our hospital staff did not occur, beyond the community outbreak, even in the absence of strict infection control measures in non-clinical areas. Current PPE appears to be effective when used appropriately. Our findings emphasize the importance of testing both clinical and non-clinical staff groups during a pandemic.","Zheng, C; Hafezi-Bakhtiari, N; Cooper, V; Davidson, H; Habibi, M; Riley, P; Breathnach, A",J Hosp Infect,425,23

Given the opaque processes behind modern search engines, it is important to understand the extent to which the “picture” of the Covid-19 pandemic accessed by users differs. We explore variations in what users “see” concerning the pandemic through Google image search, using a two-step approach. First, we crowdsource a search task to users in four regions of Europe, asking them to help us create a photo documentary of Covid-19 by providing image search queries. Analysing the queries, we find five common themes describing information needs. Next, we study three sources of variation - users’ information needs, their geo-locations and query languages - and analyse their influences on the similarity of results. We find that users see the pandemic differently depending on where they live, as evidenced by the 46% similarity across results. When users expressed a given query in different languages, there was no overlap for most of the results. Our analysis suggests that localisation plays a major role in the (dis)similarity of results, and provides evidence of the diverse “picture” of the pandemic seen through Google.","Paramita, Monica Lestari Orphanou Kalia Christoforou Evgenia Otterbacher Jahna Hopfgartner Frank",Information Processing &amp; Management,425,21

Wearing a mask correctly varied by setting with highest adherence in commercial areas and lowest in playgrounds. Almost 17% wore visible masks that did not cover the nose and/or mouth. There were multiple disparities in correct mask use. Females had higher rates than males (unadjusted relative risk = 1.40, p&lt;.0001) and seniors higher than any other age group (unadjusted chi-square p &lt; .0001). Asians wore masks correctly the most often [adjusted log odds ratio (LOR) = 0.53 compared with non-Hispanic white, p=0.02]. Correct mask-wearing was higher in areas with a higher population density (adjusted LOR =0.03 per one thousand/square mile, p=0.02) and lower in higher poverty areas (adjusted LOR= -0.01, p =.03). Disparities in adherence to mask wearing and physical distancing likely reflect differences in perception of risk by gender, age group, and race/ethnicity. While the risk of COVID-19 transmission is lower in outdoor settings, it is unlikely to be zero. The lower rates of mask use by males and minority groups suggest increased efforts are needed to enhance adherence to recommended guidelines.","Cohen, Deborah A.; Talarowski, Meghan Awomolo Olaitan Han Bing Williamson Stephanie McKenzie Thomas L.",Preventive Medicine Reports,425,17

Patients with Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS) and Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) are highly susceptible to environmental stress. In the current study, we aimed to determine how the COVID-19 pandemic psychologically affected patients with chronic progressive diseases such as AS and RA and the effects of these psychological factors on disease activity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Age and gender-matched patients with AS (n=80), RA (n=80), and healthy controls (n=80) were included in the study. All participants were evaluated with the ?Perceived COVID-19 Threat Form (PCTF)?, ?Suicide-Ideation Scale (SIS)?, ?Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)?, ?The Ability to Cope with Trauma (PACT)? and ?Psychological General Well-Being Index (PGWB)? scales. BASDAI was used in patients with AS and DAS28 was used in patients with RA to assess disease severity. RESULTS: Compared to healthy individuals, patients with RA and AS had lower PGWB scores and higher HADS depression and anxiety subscale scores. Almost all psychometric assessment test scores were worse in AS patients with high-disease activity compared to those in low-disease activity. PACT scores were higher in patients with moderate RA compared to patients with mild RA (p=0.006). While a positive correlation was identified between BASDAI and most of the psychometric assessment test scores (r=0 .36 for PCTF, r= 0.53 for depressive scores, r= 0.54 for anxiety scores, r= 0.57 for suicidal ideation), DAS28 scores were found to be associated only with PACT total and PACT perceived forward-focused subscale scores (r= -.26 and r= .33, respectively). CONCLUSION: Psychologically, AS and RA patients were found to be worse off compared to healthy controls. The perceived COVID threat and psychological status were associated with disease activity in AS, but not RA patients. Patients with chronic illnesses may be more vulnerable to the psychological effects of the pandemic, which can worsen disease activity.","Gica, Sakir; Akkubak, Yasemin; Aksoy, Zakire Kübra; Küçük, Adem; Cüre, Erkan",Turkish journal of medical sciences,425,16

Results: In the outbreaks setting, the number of cases can increase with different patterns. When the number of cases is increasing exponentially, it means that the number of cases is increasing at a certain speed, which is determined by a factor called an exponential growth factor. When this factor is greater than one, it means that the cases are increasing exponentially, and when this coefficient is equal to 1, it means that we have reached an inflection point that we will face a change in the growth rate of the cases. Conclusion: Some factors such as reducing the contact between infected and healthy people, run the social distancing program, and so on can have an effective role in decreasing epidemic growth factor and controlling the epidemic. © 2021 Tehran University of Medical Sciences.","Alimohamadi, Y.; Sepandi, M.; Teymouri, T.; Hosamirudsari, H.",Journal of Biostatistics and Epidemiology,425,12

MethodsIn all Norwegians (N=122 699) who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in three pandemic waves (March 1st-July 31st 2020 (1st wave), August 1st-December 31st 2020 (2nd wave), and January 1st-May 31st 2021 (3rd wave)), we studied the age- and sex-specific share of patients (by age groups 1-19, 20-67, and 68 or more) who had: 1) Relied on self-care, 2) used primary care, and 3) used specialist care. ResultsWe find that a remarkably high and stable share (70-80%) of patients with COVID-19 exclusively had contact with primary care in the acute phase, both in the 1st, 2nd and 3rd wave. The mean number of primary care visits ranged between 2 and 4. We also show that the use of specialist care in the acute 30-day phase of COVID-19 has decreased, from 14% being hospitalized at least once during spring 2020, to 4% during spring 2021. The mean number of hospital bed-days decreased significantly for men from the 1st to the 2nd wave (from 13 days, 95% CI=11.5-14.5 to 10 days (9-11) for men aged [≥]68 years, and from 11 days (10-12) to 9 days (8-10) for men aged 20-67 years), but not for women.

DESIGN: Longitudinal cohort study. SETTING: Academic tertiary care center. PARTICIPANTS: Intervention group (nâ¯=â¯15): residents who completed the intern surgical skills curriculum and had performance evaluations in fall of intern year, spring of intern year, and fall of second year. Control group (nâ¯=â¯8): second-year residents who were 1 year ahead of the intervention group in the same residency program, did not participate in the curriculum, and had performance evaluations in fall of second year. RESULTS: In fall of second year of residency, the intervention group had better performance (presented as median values with interquartile ranges) than the control group on one-hand ties (left hand: 9.1 [6.3-10.1] vs 14.6 [13.5-15.4] seconds, pâ¯=â¯0.007; right hand: 8.7 [8.5-9.6] vs 11.5 [9.9-16.8] seconds, pâ¯=â¯0.039).

According to present literature, the mean seroprevalence of infection was estimated as 14.7%. The seropositivity rate of N. caninum in aborted cows was found to be 18%. The financial costs were estimated in US$ at 2019 prices. The total cost of N. caninum infection was estimated at US$710 (438-1043) per a dairy cow and the annual economic costs were estimated at US$40.5 (24.6-60.3) million for Turkey. In this study, the distribution of economic costs caused by neosporosis per cow was determined to be 67.3% for abortion, 16.8% prolonged calving interval, 4.6% milk loss, 3.5% additional artificial insemination, and 7.7% veterinary and diagnostic costs, respectively. All studies that have been conducted so far on Neosporosis are focused on the prevalence and the diagnosis of the disease in Turkey. In this study, we firstly determined the economic costs due to N. caninum infections and try to attract attention on the economic impacts of the disease. As a result, awareness among breeders regarding the epidemiology, control, and eradication of neosporosis should be raised through training activities; coordination between the relevant institutions and organizations should be ensured; emergency action plans should be prepared; and further spread of the disease should be prevented.","Demir, Pinar Ayvazoglu; Eski, Funda; Ütük, Armagan E",Trop. anim. health prod,425,1

The plasma sample preparation procedure includes a combination of protein precipitation using cold acetonitrile and liquid-liquid extraction with n-hexane-ethyl acetate (7:3, v/v). A good chromatographic separation was achieved with a Phenomenex Gemini column (C18 , 150 mm × 2.0 mm, 5 µm) at 40°C with gradient elution, at 211 nm. Calibration curves were linear in the range 10-10,000 ng/mL, with a lower limit of quantification of 10 ng/mL using 100 µL of plasma. The accuracy and precision in all validation experiments were within the criteria range set by the guidelines of the Food and Drug Administration. This method was successfully applied to a preliminary pharmacokinetic study in rats following an intravenous bolus administration of LPV. Moreover, the method was subsequently fully validated for human plasma, allowing its use in therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM). In conclusion, this novel, simple and cost-efficient bioanalytical method for determination of LPV is useful for pharmacokinetic and drug delivery studies in rats, as well as TDM in human patients.","Qin, Chaolong; Feng, Wanshan; Chu, YenJu; Lee, Jong Bong; Berton, Mattia; Bettonte, Sara; Teo, Yeong Yeu; Stocks, Michael J; Fischer, Peter M; Gershkovich, Pavel",Biomed Chromatogr,425,23

TRIAL DESIGN: Randomized, controlled trial with parallel assignment. Adults will be assigned either to daily use of a meditation app for 30 days or to a control group (no usage of meditation app) with a 1:1 equivalence allocation ratio. PARTICIPANTS: Inclusion Criteria: Participants must be 18 or older, have a smartphone, able to download apps to their smartphone, must be fluent in the English language, able to complete surveys on their own, and must be in the United States for the duration of the study. EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Current regular use of a mindfulness or meditation app, regular practice of mindfulness or meditation, regular therapy sessions, inability to complete surveys independently, or any mental health restrictions that would prevent participation. All data will be collected through the Insight Timer Meditation App and Google Forms. This trial is being conducted through the Lake Erie College of Osteopathic Medicine in Erie, PA, with all data collected digitally. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Intervention: Participants will be sent a link to a pre-intervention survey prior to first use of the mindfulness app. Participants will be instructed to use the Insight Timer app for 10 minutes daily for 30 days. At the end of the 30-day intervention period, participants will be sent a link for the post-intervention survey. Two months after the conclusion of the 30-day intervention period, participants will be sent a link for another post-intervention survey. Comparator: Participants will receive the same surveys, but will not use any mindfulness app for the 30-day intervention period. After this 30-day period, participants are invited to use the Insight Timer app if they so choose. MAIN OUTCOMES: The main outcomes are (1) anxiety as assessed by survey questions adapted from the GAD7, comparing pre-intervention to post-30-days of app usage and (2) well-being as assessed by survey questions adapted from the WHO-5, comparing pre-intervention and post-30-days of app usage. RANDOMIZATION: Participants will be allocated to interventions via a block random sequence generator with a 1:1 allocation ratio in blocks of 8. BLINDING (MASKING): No masking is being used in this study (open label). NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMIZED (SAMPLE SIZE): Approximately 75 participants will be randomized to each group, with an estimated enrollment of 150 participants.

This context has underscored the reality that drivers of customer delight in a “traditional” context are not the same in a crisis context. While research has tended to identify hedonic need fulfillment as key to customer well-being and, ultimately, to invoking customer delight, the majority of studies were conducted in inherently positive contexts, which may limit generalizability to more challenging contexts. Through the combined lens of transformative service research (TSR) and psychological theory on hedonic and eudaimonic human needs, we evaluate the extent to which need fulfillment is the root of customer well-being and that meeting well-being needs ultimately promotes delight. We argue that in crisis contexts, the salience of needs shifts from hedonic to eudaimonic and the extent to which service experiences fulfill eudaimonic needs determines the experience and meaning of delight. Design/methodology/approach: Utilizing the critical incident technique, this research surveyed 240 respondents who were asked to explain in detail a time they experienced customer delight during the COVID-19 pandemic. We analyzed their responses according to whether these incidents reflected the salience of hedonic versus eudaimonic need fulfillment. Findings: The results support the notion that the salience of eudaimonic needs become more pronounced during times of crisis and that service providers are more likely to elicit perceptions of delight when they leverage meeting eudaimonic needs over the hedonic needs that are typically emphasized in traditional service encounters. Originality/value: We discuss the implications of these findings for integrating the TSR and customer delight literatures to better understand how service experiences that meet salient needs produce customer well-being and delight. Ultimately, we find customer delight can benefit well-being across individual, collective and societal levels.","Barnes, Donald C.; Mesmer-Magnus, Jessica; Krallman, Alexandra; Scribner, Lisa L.; Guidice, Rebecca M.",J.

Building on work by Abbey and colleagues about effects of question format, participants in this study (1,253; 621 female; 632 male) were randomly assigned to one of two versions of the Sexual Aggression and Victimization Scale (SAV-S). In Version 1, the coercive tactic (use/threat of physical force, exploitation of the inability to resist, verbal pressure) was presented first, and sexual acts (sexual touch, attempted and completed sexual intercourse, other sexual acts) were presented as subsequent questions. In Version 2, sexual acts were presented first, and coercive tactics as subsequent questions. No version effects emerged for overall perpetration rates reported by men and women. The overall victimization rate across all items was significantly higher in the tactic-first than in the sexual-act-first conditions for women, but not for men. Classifying participants by their most severe experience of sexual victimization showed that fewer women were in the nonvictim category and more men were in the nonconsensual sexual contact category when the coercive tactic was presented first. Sexual experience background did not moderate the findings. The implications for the measurement of self-reported sexual aggression victimization and perpetration are discussed.","Schuster, Isabell; Tomaszewska, Paulina; Marchewka, Juliette; Krahé, Barbara",J Sex Res,425,16

By semi-parametrically combining incomplete observed data from three different sources, namely, the Monthly Longitudinal Labour Force Survey, the Survey of Income and Housing and the administrative payroll data, we estimate the impact of COVID-19 and the associated policy responses on the Australian income distribution between February and June 2020, covering the immediate periods before and after the initial outbreak. Our results suggest that despite the growth in unemployment, the Gini of the equalised disposable income inequality dropped by nearly 0.03 point since February. The reduction is because of the additional wage subsidies and welfare supports offered as part of the policy response, offsetting a potential surge in income inequality. Additionally, the poverty rate, which could have been doubled in the absence of the government response, also reduced by 3 to 4 percentage points. The result shows the effectiveness of temporary policy measures in maintaining both the living standards and the level of income inequality. However, the heavy reliance on the support measures raises the possibility that the changes in the income distribution may be reversed and even substantially worsened off should the measures be withdrawn.","Li, Jinjing; Vidyattama, Yogi; La, Hai Anh; Miranti, Riyana; Sologon, Denisa M",,425,24

Prior studies of telehealth clinical swallowing evaluations provide positive evidence for telemanagement of swallowing. However, the reliability of these measures in clinical practice, as opposed to well-controlled research conditions, remains unknown. This study aimed to investigate the reliability of outcome measures derived from clinical swallowing tele-evaluations in real-world clinical practice (e.g., variability in devices and Internet connectivity, lack of in-person clinician assistance, or remote patient/caregiver training). Method Seven raters asynchronously judged clinical swallowing tele-evaluations of 12 movement disorders patients. Outcomes included the Timed Water Swallow Test (TWST), Test of Masticating and Swallowing Solids (TOMASS), and common observations of oral intake. Statistical analyses were performed to examine inter- and intrarater reliability, as well as qualitative analyses exploring patient and clinician-specific factors impacting reliability. Results Forty-four trials were included for reliability analyses. All rater dyads demonstrated ""good"" to ""excellent"" interrater reliability for measures of the TWST (intraclass correlation coefficients [ICCs] &#8805; .93) and observations of oral intake (&#8805; 77% agreement). The majority of TOMASS outcomes demonstrated ""good"" to ""excellent"" interrater reliability (ICCs &#8805; .84), with the exception of the number of bites (ICCs = .43-.99) and swallows (ICCs = .21-.85). Immediate and delayed intrarater reliability were ""excellent"" for most raters across all tasks, ranging between ICCs of .63 and 1.00. Exploratory factors potentially impacting reliability included infrequent instances of suboptimal video quality, reduced camera stability, camera distance, and obstruction of the patient's mouth during tasks. Conclusions Subjective observations of oral intake and objective measures taken from the TWST and the TOMASS can be reliably measured via telehealth in clinical practice. Our results provide support for the feasibility and reliability of telehealth for outpatient clinical swallowing evaluations during COVID-19 and beyond.

The current pandemic of the novel 2019 coronavirus disease has required hospitals in numerous countries to expand their surge capacity to meet the needs of patients with critical illness. When even surge capacity is exceeded, however, principles of critical care triage may be needed as a means to allocate scarce resources, such as mechanical ventilators or key medications. The goal of a triage system is to direct limited resources towards patients most likely to benefit from them. Implementing a triage system requires careful coordination between clinicians, health systems, local and regional governments, and the public, with a goal of transparency to maintain trust. We discuss the principles of tertiary triage and methods for implementing such a system, emphasizing that these systems should serve only as a last resort. Even under triage, we must uphold our obligation to care for all patients as best possible under difficult circumstances.","Maves, Ryan C; Downar, James; Dichter, Jeffrey R; Hick, John L; Devereaux, Asha; Geiling, James A; Kissoon, Niranjan; Hupert, Nathaniel; Niven, Alexander S; King, Mary A; Rubinson, Lewis L; Hanfling, Dan; Hodge, James G; Marshall, Mary Faith; Fischkoff, Katherine; Evans, Laura E; Tonelli, Mark R; Wax, Randy S; Seda, Gilbert; Parrish, John S; Truog, Robert D; Sprung, Charles L; Christian, Michael D",Chest,425,16

We investigated the effect of inflammatory molecules to identify any marker that is related to lung fibrosis in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Seventy-six COVID-19 patients who were admitted to Youan Hospital between January 21 and March 20, 2020 and recovered were recruited for this study. Pulmonary fibrosis, represented as fibrotic volume on chest CT images, was computed by an artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted program. Plasma samples were collected from the participants shortly after admission, to measure the basal inflammatory molecules levels. At discharge, fibrosis was present in 46 (60.5%) patients whose plasma interferon-Î³ (IFN-Î³) levels were twofold lower than those without fibrosis (p > 0.05). The multivariate-adjusted logistic regression analysis demonstrated the inverse association risk of having lung fibrosis and basal circulating IFN-Î³ levels with an estimate of 0.43 (p = 0.02). Per the 1-SD increase of basal IFN-Î³ level in circulation, the fibrosis volume decreased by 0.070% (p = 0.04) at the discharge of participants. The basal circulating IFN-Î³ levels were comparable with c-reactive protein in the discrimination of the occurrence of lung fibrosis among COVID-19 patients at discharge, unlike circulating IL-6 levels. In conclusion, these data indicate that decreased circulating IFN-Î³ is a risk factor of lung fibrosis in COVID-19.","Hu, Zhong-Jie; Xu, Jia; Yin, Ji-Ming; Li, Li; Hou, Wei; Zhang, Li-Li; Zhou, Zhen; Yu, Yi-Zhou; Li, Hong-Jun; Feng, Ying-Mei; Jin, Rong-Hua",Front Immunol,425,16

Community mitigation measures can help slow the spread of COVID-19; these measures include wearing masks, social distancing, reducing the number and size of large gatherings, pausing operation of businesses where maintaining social distancing is challenging, working from or staying at home, and implementing certain workplace and educational institution controls (1-4). The Arizona Department of Health Services' (ADHS) recommendations for mitigating exposure to SARS-CoV-2 were informed by continual monitoring of patient demographics, SARS-CoV-2 community spread, and the pandemic's impacts on hospitals. To assess the effect of mitigation strategies in Arizona, the numbers of daily COVID-19 cases and 7-day moving averages during January 22-August 7, 2020, relative to implementation of enhanced community mitigation measures, were examined. The average number of daily cases increased approximately 151%, from 808 on June 1, 2020 to 2,026 on June 15, 2020 (after stay-at-home order lifted), necessitating increased preventive measures. On June 17, local officials began implementing and enforcing mask wearing (via county and city mandates),* affecting approximately 85% of the state population. Statewide mitigation measures included limitation of public events; closures of bars, gyms, movie theaters, and water parks; reduced restaurant dine-in capacity; and voluntary resident action to stay at home and wear masks (when and where not mandated).

One of the sources for gaining valuable insight into public sentiment is through social media. This study aims to extract this insight by producing a list of the most discussed topics regarding COVID-19 on Twitter every week and monitoring the evolution of topics from week to week. This research will propose two topic mining that can handle a large-scale dataset-rolling online non-negative matrix factorization (Rolling-ONMF) and sliding online non-negative matrix factorization (Sliding-ONMF)-and compare the insights produced by both techniques. Each algorithm produces 425 topics over the course of 17 weeks. However, topics that have not evolved from one week to the next beyond a certain evolution threshold are consolidated into a single topic. Since the topics produced by the Rolling-ONMF algorithm each week depend on the topics from the previous week, we find that the Sliding-ONMF algorithm produces more varied topics each week; however, the topics produced by the Rolling-ONMF algorithm contain keywords that appear more consistent with each other when reviewing the terms manually. We also observe that the Sliding-ONMF algorithm is able to capture events that have shorter time frames rather than ones that last throughout many months while the Rolling-ONMF algorithm detects more general themes due to a higher average evolution score which leads to more topic consolidation. We have also conducted a qualitative analysis and grouped the detected topics into themes. A number of important themes such as government policy, economic crisis, COVID-19-related updates, COVID-19-related events, prevention, vaccines and treatments, and COVID-19 testing are identified. These reflected the concerns related to the pandemic expressed in social media.","Chang, Chia-Hsuan; Monselise, Michal; Yang, Christopher C",J Healthc Inform Res,425,1

Strong TRPV1 stimulation with capsaicin causes mitochondrial damage in primary sensory neurons. However, the effect of repetitive and moderate exposure to capsaicin on the integrity of neuronal mitochondria remains largely unknown. Our electron microscopic analysis revealed that repetitive stimulation of the facial skin of mice with 10 mM capsaicin induced short-term damage to the mitochondria in small-sized trigeminal ganglion neurons. Further, capsaicin-treated mice exhibited decreased sensitivity to noxious heat stimulation, indicating TRPV1 dysfunction, in parallel with the mitochondrial damage in the trigeminal ganglion neurons. To analyze the capsaicin-induced mitochondrial damage and its relevant cellular events in detail, we performed cell-based assays using TRPV1-expressing PC12 cells. Dose-dependent capsaicin-mediated mitochondrial toxicity was observed. High doses of capsaicin caused rapid destruction of mitochondrial internal structure, while low doses induced mitochondrial swelling. Further, capsaicin induced a dose-dependent loss of mitochondria and autophagy-mediated degradation of mitochondria (mitophagy). Concomitantly, transcriptional upregulation of mitochondrial proteins, cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV, Mic60/Mitofilin, and voltage-dependent anion channel 1 was observed, which implied induction of mitochondrial biogenesis to compensate for the loss of mitochondria. Collectively, although trigeminal ganglion neurons transiently exhibit mitochondrial damage and TRPV1 dysfunction following moderate capsaicin exposure, they appear to be resilient to such a challenge. Our in vitro data show a dose-response relationship in capsaicin-mediated mitochondrial toxicity. We postulate that induction of mitophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis in response to capsaicin stimulation play important roles in repairing the damaged mitochondrial system.","Shibata, Mamoru; Kayama, Yohei; Takizawa, Tsubasa; Ibata, Keiji; Shimizu, Toshihiko; Yuzaki, Michisuke; Suzuki, Norihiro; Nakahara, Jin",Mol Pain,425,24

These firms were pressed to take immediate action to protect their employees' safety and financial well-being. However, firms varied considerably in the degree to which they took action, and stakeholders appeared to take notice. Leveraging attribution theory, we build theory around the impact of firm actions to protect employee safety and compensation on stakeholder sentiment toward the firm. We further examined how firm leadership helped shape stakeholder sentiment by theorizing about the joint impact of actions with Chief Executive Officer (CEO) benevolence. We built a unique, multisourced data set and tested our theory on a sample of public firms in the consumer staples sector. Our longitudinal analysis of positive stakeholder sentiment expressed on social media demonstrated the importance of these immediate firm actions on sentiment in the initial months of the pandemic. Specifically, firm compensation actions were associated with a growth in positive sentiment over these months, particularly when made by CEOs with high benevolence, whereas firm safety actions led to growth in positive sentiment but only when made by CEOs with low benevolence. We discuss the implications of these findings for our understanding of firm actions and leadership at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Therefore, recommendations for the allocation of intensive care resources in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic have been developed by a multidisciplinary group of authors with the support of eight scientific medical societies. The recommendations for procedures and criteria for prioritisations in case of resource scarcity are based on scientific evidence, ethicolegal considerations and practical experience. Medical decisions must always be based on the need and the treatment preferences of the individual patient. In addition to this patient-centred approach, prioritisations in case of resource scarcity require a supraindividual perspective. In such situations, prioritisations should be based on the criterion of clinical prospect of success in order to minimize the number of preventable deaths due to resource scarcity and to avoid discrimination based on age, disabilities or social factors.

These isolations quickly made it possible to carry out the first tests for antiviral agents' susceptibility and drug repurposing. However, it seems important to make an inventory of all the cells that can support the growth of this virus and evaluate possible differences between isolates. In the present work, we tested 4 strains of SARS-CoV-2 locally isolated on a panel of 34 cell lines present in our laboratory and commonly used for the isolation of human pathogenic microorganism. After inoculation, cells were observed for cytopathic effects and quantitative real-time polymerase reaction was used to measure the virus replication on the cells. We were able to obtain growth on 7 cell lines, 6 simian, and the human Caco-2. The cytopathogenic effects are variable, ranging from lysis of the cell monolayer in 48-72 h to no cytopathic effect in spite of intense multiplication, as in Caco-2 cells. Interestingly, effect and multiplication varied widely according to the strain tested. In this paper, we explored the species specificity and tissue tropism of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro on a panel of cells available in our laboratory and identified human and animal cell lines susceptible to support SARS-CoV-2 replication. Our work highlights the importance of testing multiple strains when testing antiviral molecules and performing patho-physiological analyzes.","Wurtz, Nathalie; Penant, Gwilherm; Jardot, Priscilla; Duclos, Nathalie; La Scola, Bernard",Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis,425,20

ACE2 is also the receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Based on the claim that RAS inhibitors (RASIs) cause ACE2 overexpression in some animal experiments, concerns have arisen that RASIs may aggravate SARS-CoV-2 infection and coronavirus disease-2019 severity in RASI-treated patients. To achieve a comprehensive review, a systematic search of MEDLINE/PubMed was conducted regarding the effects of RASIs on tissue ACE2 mRNA/protein expression in healthy animals and animal models of human diseases. We identified 88 eligible articles involving 168 experiments in the heart, kidneys, lungs, and other organs. Three of 38 experiments involving healthy animals showed ACE2 expression greater than twice that of the control (overexpression). Among 102 disease models (130 experiments), baseline ACE2 was overexpressed in 16 models (18 experiments) and less than half the control level (repression) in 28 models (40 experiments). In 72 experiments, RASIs did not change ACE2 levels from the baseline levels of disease models. RASIs caused ACE2 overexpression compared to control levels in seven experiments, some of which were unsupported by other experiments under similar conditions. In 36 experiments, RASIs reversed or prevented disease-induced ACE2 repression, yielding no or marginal changes. Therefore, ACE2 overexpression appears to be a rare rather than common consequence of RASI treatment in healthy animals and disease models. Future studies should clarify the pathophysiological significance of RASI-induced reversal or prevention of ACE2 repression in disease models.","Kai, Hisashi; Kai, Mamiko; Niiyama, Hiroshi; Okina, Norihito; Sasaki, Motoki; Maeda, Takanobu; Katoh, Atsushi",Hypertens. res,425,1

DESIGN: This was a retrospective chart review looking at emergency referrals seen by the ophthalmology service between March 18 to April 17, 2020 (representing the COVID-19 period), and March 18 to April 17, 2019 (representing the pre-COVID-19 period). METHODS: Data gathered from referral records included patient demographics, timing and site of referral, and ophthalmic diagnosis. Referrals were categorized as urgent or nonurgent, with urgent indicating the need for ophthalmic assessment within 24 hours. RESULTS: The total number of referrals decreased by 54.2% in the COVID-19 period versus the pre-COVID-19 period. There was a similar bimodal age distribution in both periods, with fewer patients over 65 years of age presenting during the pandemic. Tertiary hospital referrals decreased by 62% in the pandemic period, while nontertiary emergency department referral trends varied and outpatient clinic referrals increased by 16%. Overall, there was a significant shift in the distribution of referral sites (pâ¯=â¯0.04). The proportion of urgent referrals increased by 14% during the pandemic; this was not statistically significant. There was no significant change in the timing of referrals or in the distribution of diagnostic segments. CONCLUSIONS: This study offers insight into the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on ophthalmology referral patterns in a Canadian context. Moving forward, it helps to guide resource allocation and public education on the importance of seeking necessary eye care.","Schlenker, Amanda; Tadrous, Carol; Ching, Geoffrey; Iovieno, Alfonso; Nathoo, Nawaaz; Liu, Tom; Yeung, Sonia N",Can. j. ophthalmol,425,24

However, the broad restrictive measures typically associated with lockdowns, though effective, also comes at a cost - imposing significant social and economic burdens on individuals and societies, especially for those in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Like most high-income countries (HICs), many LMICs initially adopted broad lockdown strategies for COVID-19 in the first wave of the pandemic. While many HICs experiencing subsequent waves have returned to employing lockdown strategies until they can receive the first shipments of COVID-19 vaccine, many LMICs will likely have to wait much longer to get comparable access for their own citizens. In leaving LMICs vulnerable to subsequent waves for a longer period of time without vaccines, there is a risk LMICs will be tempted to re-impose lockdown measures in the meantime. In response to the urgent need for more policy development around the contextual challenges involved in employing such measures, we propose some strategies LMICs could adopt for safe and responsible lockdown entrance/exit or to avoid re-imposing coercive restrictive lockdown measures altogether.","Eyawo, Oghenowede; Viens, A M; Ugoji, Uchechukwu Chidiebere",Global Health,425,1

Objective: Analyze SARS-CoV-2 infection in pediatric patients with hemoglobinopathy. Methods: Using the online platforms LILACS, PUBMED and EMBASE, on 17- JUL-2020 a search was made for the terms COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 associated with ""sickle cell"", ""thalassemia"" and ""hemoglobinopathy"". Results: There were 623 pediatric and adult patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) or beta thalassemia (BT) and COVID-19. Total mortality rate was 6.42%. No pediatric patient with BT has been described. So, our analysis focused on children and adolescents with SCD: there were 121 pediatric patients, one adolescent died, prophylactic anticoagulation was prescribed to six patients, 11.76% needed intensive care unit, blood transfusion was prescribed in 29.70%. Vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) and acute chest syndrome (ACS) were the main clinical manifestations in SCD. Discussion: Pediatric patients with SCD and COVID-19 have a low mortality rate when compared to adults, although is higher than the global pediatric population with COVID-19 (0-0.67%). The comorbidities associated with age and the long-term complications inherent to hemoglobinopathies may contribute to the increased mortality outside the pediatric age group. In SCD the clinical manifestations, both in children and adults, are VOC and ACS, and there was increase in blood requirement. Pediatric SCD patients with COVID-19 need more intensive care unit than the global pediatric population (3.30%).

The potential to reaerate consolidated lung tissue in COVID-19-related ARDS is heavily debated. This study assessed the potential to reaerate lung consolidations in patients with COVID-19-related ARDS under invasive ventilation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of patients with COVID-19-related ARDS who underwent chest computed tomography (CT) at low positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and after a recruitment maneuver at high PEEP of 20 cm H2O. Lung reaeration, volume, and weight were calculated using both CT scans. CT scans were performed after intubation and start of ventilation (early CT), or after several days of intensive care unit admission (late CT). RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients were analyzed. The median percentages of reaerated and nonaerated lung tissue were 19% [interquartile range, IQR: 10 to 33] and 11% [IQR: 4 to 15] for patients with early and late CT scans, respectively (P=0.049). End-expiratory lung volume showed a median increase of 663 mL [IQR: 483 to 865] and 574 mL [IQR: 292 to 670] after recruitment for patients with early and late CT scans, respectively (P=0.43). The median decrease in lung weight attributed to nonaerated lung tissue was 229 g [IQR: 165 to 376] and 171 g [IQR: 81 to 229] after recruitment for patients with early and late CT scans, respectively (P=0.16). CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients with COVID-19-related ARDS undergoing invasive ventilation had substantial reaeration of lung consolidations after recruitment and ventilation at high PEEP. Higher PEEP can be considered in patients with reaerated lung consolidations when accompanied by improvement in compliance and gas exchange.","Smit, Marry R; Beenen, Ludo F M; Valk, Christel M A; de Boer, Milou M; Scheerder, Maeke J; Annema, Jouke T; Paulus, Frederique; Horn, Janneke; Vlaar, Alexander P J; Kooij, Fabian O; Hollmann, Markus W; Schultz, Marcus J; Bos, Lieuwe D J",J. thorac imaging,425,22

Methods: Anterior Imaging Module (AIM) was constructed based on a 50/50 beam splitter design, to match the magnification drum optics of slit-lamps with a three-step or higher level of magnification. The design fills the smartphone sensor fully at the lowest magnification and matches the fixed focus of the slit-lamp. It comes with a smartphone for instant photo-documentation, an in-built software application for data-management and secure HIPAA compliant cloud storage, and a Bluetooth trigger for a one-tap image capture. The construction of the device is explained, and the optical resolution measured using U.S. air-force resolution test. AIM's performance was characterized with traceability to internationally relevant performance standards for digital slit-lamps after image quality assessment through a pilot study. Results: Clinically useful anterior segment images were obtained with both diffuse and slit illumination at different magnification settings with the highest magnification (40X) resolution of 359 lines per cm and the lowest magnification (16X) resolution of 113 lines per cm. Conclusion: AIM is a novel, wireless, telemedicine-enabled design that digitizes existing, analog slit lamps with at least three-step magnification. The settings ensure the focus is determined purely by the position of the slit-lamp. Hence, the image viewed and captured on the smartphone is exactly what the clinician sees through the eyepiece. This helps in maintaining distance from the patient in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, as well.","Dutt, Sreetama; Vadivel, Siva S; Nagarajan, Shanmuganathan; Galagali, Amrutha; Christy, Josephine S; Sivaraman, Anand; Rao, Divya Parthasarathy",Indian J Ophthalmol,425,16

Currently, the global community is facing emerging virus SARS-CoV-2 belonging to Betacoronavirus, which appears to be more transmissible but less deadly than SARS-CoV. The current study aimed to track the evolutionary ancestors and different evolutionary strategies that were genetically adapted by SARS-CoV-2. Our whole-genome analysis revealed that SARS-CoV-2 was the descendant of Bat SARS/SARS-like CoVs and bats served as a natural reservoir. SARS-CoV-2 used mutations and recombination as crucial strategies in different genomic regions including the envelop, membrane, nucleocapsid, and spike glycoproteins to become a novel infectious agent. We confirmed that mutations in different genomic regions of SARS-CoV-2 have specific influence on virus reproductive adaptability, allowing for genotype adjustment and adaptations in rapidly changing environments. Moreover, for the first time we identified nine putative recombination patterns in SARS-CoV-2, which encompass spike glycoprotein, RdRp, helicase and ORF3a. Six recombination regions were spotted in the S gene and are undoubtedly important for evolutionary survival, meanwhile this permitted the virus to modify superficial antigenicity to find a way from immune reconnaissance in animals and adapt to a human host. With these combined natural selected strategies, SARS-CoV-2 emerged as a novel virus in human society.","Rehman, Saif Ur; Shafique, Laiba; Ihsan, Awais; Liu, Qingyou",Pathogens,425,18

SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are higher in severely or critically ill COVID-19 patients, but studies have not focused on levels in convalescent patients with MetS, which this study aimed to assess. METHODS: This retrospective study focused on adult convalescent outpatients with SARS-CoV-2 positive serology during the COVID-19 pandemic at NewYork Presbyterian/Weill Cornell. Data collected for descriptive and correlative analysis included SARS-COV-2 immunoglobin G (IgG) levels and history of MetS comorbidities from April 17, 2020 to May 20, 2020. Additional data, including SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels, body mass index (BMI), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and lipid levels were collected and analyzed for a second cohort from May 21, 2020 to June 21, 2020. SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies were measured in a subset of the study cohort. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels were significantly higher in convalescent individuals with MetS comorbidities. When adjusted for age, sex, race, and time duration from symptom onset to testing, increased SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels remained significantly associated with obesity (P < 0.0001). SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels were significantly higher in patients with HbA1c &#8805;6.5% compared to those with HbA1c <5.7% (P = 0.0197) and remained significant on multivariable analysis (P = 0.0104). A positive correlation was noted between BMI and antibody levels [95% confidence interval: 0.37 (0.20-0.52) P < 0.0001]. Neutralizing antibody titers were higher in COVID-19 individuals with BMI &#8805; 30 (P = 0.0055).

Although the leading cause of mortality in patients with COVID-19 is hypoxic respiratory failure due to viral pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, accumulating evidence has shown that the risk of thromboembolism is substantially high in patients with severe COVID-19 and that a thromboembolic event is another major complication contributing to the high morbidity and mortality in patients with COVID-19. Endothelial dysfunction is emerging as one of the main contributors to the pathogenesis of thromboembolic events in COVID-19. Endothelial dysfunction is usually referred to as reduced nitric oxide bioavailability. However, failures of the endothelium to control coagulation, inflammation, or permeability are also instances of endothelial dysfunction. Recent studies have indicated the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 can directly infect endothelial cells via the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 pathway and that endothelial dysfunction caused by direct virus infection of endothelial cells may contribute to thrombotic complications and severe disease outcomes in patients with COVID-19. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of relationships between SARS-CoV-2 infection, endothelial dysfunction, and pulmonary and extrapulmonary complications in patients with COVID-19.","Maruhashi, Tatsuya; Higashi, Yukihito",Int. j. mol. sci.

We aimed to observe the dynamic changes of D-dimer levels during disease progression to evaluate their value for thrombosis. In this study, we report the clinical and laboratory results of 57 patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia and 46 patients with confirmed community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CAP). And their concentrations of D-dimer, infection-related biomarkers, and conventional coagulation were retrospectively analyzed. The Padua prediction score is used to identify patients at high risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE). The results found that, on admission, both in COVID-19 patients and CAP patients, D-dimer levels were significantly increased, and compared with CAP patients, D-dimer levels were higher in COVID-19 patients (P < 0.05). Besides, we found that in COVID-19 patients, D-dimer were related with markers of inflammation, especially with hsCRP (R = 0.426, P < 0.05). However, there was low correlation between VTE score and D-dimer levels (Spearman's R = 0.264, P > 0.05) weakened the role of D-dimer in the prediction of thrombosis. After treatments, D-dimer levels decreased which was synchronous with hsCRP levels in patients with good clinical prognosis, but there were still some patients with anomalous increasing D-dimer levels after therapy. In conclusion, elevated baseline D-dimer levels are associated with inflammation but not with VTE score in COVID-19 patients, suggesting that it is unreasonable to judge whether anticoagulation is needed only according to D-dimer levels. However, the abnormal changes of D-dimer and inflammatory factors suggest that anticoagulant therapy might be needed.","Yu, Bilian; Li, Xin; Chen, Jin; Ouyang, Mingqi; Zhang, Hong; Zhao, Xinge; Tang, Liang; Luo, Qin; Xu, Min; Yang, Lizhen; Huang, Guxiang; Liu, Xianling; Tang, Jianjun",J Thromb Thrombolysis,425,5

Side-holes have been shown to increase flow rates and decrease recirculation but have been associated with clotting/increased infection rates. This study investigates the impact of changing the shape, size and number of side-holes on a simple symmetric tip catheter by evaluating the velocity, shear stress and shear rate of inflowing blood. A platelet model is used to examine the residence time and shear history of inflowing platelets. The results show that side-holes improve the theoretical performance of the catheters, reducing the maximum velocity and shear stress occurring at the tip compared to non-side-hole catheters. Increasing the side-hole area improved performance up to a point, past which not all inflow through the hole was captured, and instead a small fraction slowly 'washed-out' through the remainder of the tip resulting in greater residence times and increasing the likelihood of platelet adhesion. An oval shaped hole presents a lower chance of external fibrin formation compared to a circular hole, although this would also be influenced by the catheter material surface topology which is dependent on the manufacturing process. Overall, whilst side-holes may be associated with increased clotting and infection, this can be reduced when side-hole geometry is correctly implemented though; a sufficient area for body diameter (minimising residence time) and utilising angle-cut, oval shaped holes (reducing shear stress and chances of fibrin formation partially occluding holes).","Owen, David G; de Oliveira, Diana C; Qian, Shuang; Green, Naomi C; Shepherd, Duncan E T; Espino, Daniel M",PLoS One,425,9

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of the use of two types of PPE on quality of vision during gastrointestinal endoscopy. METHODS: A cross-sectional observational pilot study in gastroenterologists who undergo an ophthalmological examination of visual acuity and quality of vision when using two types of PPE. Type #1: 3M N95 1860 green respirator + 3M mono safety glasses + protective screen. Type #2: 3M 6800 full facepiece + 3M NIOSH 7093C HF/P100 filters. RESULTS: Visual acuity and quality of vison parameters while using the PPE that is routinely used when performing gastrointestinal endoscopy during the pandemic were evaluated. It was found that Modality #1 was associated with decreases of up to 37% in visual acuity, 25% in colour visualisation and 75% in contrast sensitivity among digestive endoscopists within minutes of placement. These figures worsened over the course of the procedure, rising to 75%, 60% and 100%, respectively. Modality #2 was not associated with any deterioration in quality of vision.

Existing research mainly focuses on indoor droplet dispersion, but the mechanism of its dispersion and exposure in outdoor environment is unclear. By conducting CFD simulations, this paper investigates the evaporation and transport of solid-liquid droplets in an open outdoor environment. Droplet initial sizes (dp = 10 µm, 50 µm, 100 µm), background relative humidity (RH = 35%, 95%), background wind speed (Uref = 3 m/s, 0.2 m/s) and social distances between two people (D = 0.5 m, 1 m, 1.5 m, 3 m, 5 m) are investigated. Results show that thermal body plume is destroyed when the background wind speed is 3 m/s (Froude number Fr ~ 10). The inhalation fraction (IF) of susceptible person decreases exponentially when the social distance (D) increases from 0.5 m to 5 m. The exponential decay rate of inhalation fraction (b) ranges between 0.93 and 1.06 (IF=IF0e-b(D-0.5)) determined by the droplet initial diameter and relative humidity. Under weak background wind (Uref = 0.2 m/s, Fr ~ 0.01), the upward thermal body plume significantly influences droplet dispersion, which is similar with that in indoor space. Droplets in the initial sizes of 10 µm and 50 µm disperse upwards while most of 100 µm droplets fall down to the ground due to larger gravity force. Interestingly, the deposition fraction on susceptible person is ten times higher at Uref = 3 m/s than that at Uref = 0.2 m/s. Thus, a high outdoor wind speed does not necessarily lead to a smaller exposure risk if the susceptible person locating at the downwind region of the infected person, and people in outdoors are suggested to not only keep distance of greater than 1.5 m from each other but also stand with considerable angles from the prevailing wind direction.","Yang, Xia; Yang, Hongyu; Ou, Cuiyun; Luo, Zhiwen; Hang, Jian",Sci Total Environ,425,5

As part of the COVID-19 International Student Wellbeing Study, a survey on socio-demographic situation, study information, living arrangements, lifestyle behaviors, stress, questions about COVID-19 infection and knowledge and concern about COVID-19 infection was sent via email to relevant university students in Denmark in May, 2020 (n = 2.945). Stepwise multiple linear regression analysis was employed. Our results showed that around 60% of the students were not concerned about COVID-19, while 68% reported that they followed governmental measures. The main facilitators for following the recommendations were older age, concern about COVID-19 and depression, while barriers were living in a student hall, being physical active or reporting mental stress. Only 9% of the variation in adhering to governmental recommendations could be explained by the analyzed predictors. Results may inform health communication.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the association between CAD and the incidence of 30-day postoperative mortality and major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) in patients undergoing bariatric surgery. SETTINGS: Multicenter cohort study. METHODS: We used the 2017 MBSAQIP database to study patients undergoing bariatric surgery from accredited centers in the United States and Canada between Jan 1, 2017, and Dec 31, 2017. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine whether established CAD was independently associated with 30-day mortality and MACE, a composite endpoint that included myocardial infarction and/or cardiac arrest. RESULTS: We reviewed data from 167,819 patients from 832 centers. There were 4172 patients with diagnosed CAD, and 163,647 without it. At 30-day follow-up, the endpoints of mortality, cardiac arrest, myocardial infarction, and MACE occurred in 172 (.10%), 82 (.05%), 57 (.03%), and 135 (.08%) patients, respectively. The endpoints occurred more significantly in patients with CAD compared with patients without CAD; 22 (.53%) versus 150 (.09%) for mortality, 13 (.31%) versus 69 (.04%) for cardiac arrest, 17 (.41%) versus 40 (.02%) for myocardial infarction, and 28 (.67%) versus 107 (.07%) for MACE (P < .001 for all comparisons). CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative mortality and MACE following bariatric surgery are higher in patients with CAD than those without; however, the absolute incidence is low (<1%).

Such development is important, for example, in the fight against the SARS-CoV-2 virus, in which covalent inhibitors can provide a promising tool for blocking Mpro, the main protease of the virus. This work develops a reliable and practical protocol for evaluating the binding free energy of covalent inhibitors. Our protocol presents a major advance over other approaches that do not consider the chemical contribution of the binding free energy. Our strategy combines the empirical valence bond method for evaluating the reaction energy profile and the PDLD/S-LRA/ß method for evaluating the noncovalent part of the binding process. This protocol has been used in the calculations of the binding free energy of an &#945;-ketoamide inhibitor of Mpro. Encouragingly, our approach reproduces the observed binding free energy. Our study of covalent inhibitors of cysteine proteases indicates that in the choice of an effective warhead it is crucial to focus on the exothermicity of the point on the free energy surface of a peptide cleavage that connects the acylation and deacylation steps. Overall, we believe that our approach should provide a powerful and effective method for in silico design of covalent drugs.","Mondal, Dibyendu; Warshel, Arieh",Biochemistry,425,16

It would not pose a health risk, but might contaminate the laboratory and affect the test results. When the sterilized medical waste bags were transferred directly by the operators without hand disinfection, re-contamination would happen, which might cause the virus to leak out of the laboratory.

METHODS: We identified 48 440 adult patients with a COVID-19 diagnosis from 1 January 2020 to 21 October 2020, with at least three exercise vital sign measurements from 19 March 2018 to 18 March 2020. We linked each patient's self-reported physical activity category (consistently inactive=0-10 min/week, some activity=11-149 min/week, consistently meeting guidelines=150+ min/week) to the risk of hospitalisation, ICU admission and death after COVID-19 diagnosis. We conducted multivariable logistic regression controlling for demographics and known risk factors to assess whether inactivity was associated with COVID-19 outcomes. RESULTS: Patients with COVID-19 who were consistently inactive had a greater risk of hospitalisation (OR 2.26; 95% CI 1.81 to 2.83), admission to the ICU (OR 1.73; 95% CI 1.18 to 2.55) and death (OR 2.49; 95% CI 1.33 to 4.67) due to COVID-19 than patients who were consistently meeting physical activity guidelines.

They represent 4 to 20% of the total number of cases reported in different geographical areas. Aim: To describe an epidemiological surveillance strategy to detect symptoms compatible with SARS-CoV-2 infection and early case detection among healthcare personnel at a university hospital. Patients and Methods: We assessed 209 healthcare workers reporting symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 in a telephone counseling system. After a structured evaluation, the suggestions ranged from having a SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal swab PCR test, consulting in the emergency room or at outpatient clinic or returning to work. Results: In 61% of assessed workers a coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal swab PCR was requested and 28 (22%) were positive. In a multivariate analysis, the clinical variables associated with a positive PCR test were the presence of fever, sudden loss of smell or taste, and a history of contact with a COVID-19 positive case. Conclusions: The telephone symptom monitoring program allowed the early detection of a significant number of healthcare officials with acute respiratory infection due to coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, it is easy to implement and has a low cost.","Poblete Umanzor, Rodrigo; Saldías Peñafiel, Fernando; Sabatini Ugarte, Natalia; Vite Valverde, Andy; Ceriani Bravo, Alejandro; Schaffeld Pernas, Soledad; Letelier Saavedra, Luz María; Gran Scheuch, José Ignacio; Rabagliati Borie, Ricardo",Rev. méd.

Although organizing pneumonia may be an idiopathic process, it usually occurs secondary to infection, aspiration, autoimmune disease, and post organ transplant or radiation. Here we present a case of a chronic cough after confirmed SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection, with CT imaging consistent with organizing pneumonia. As the current COVID-19 pandemic progresses, more will be learned about long term lung sequela of this novel coronavirus. A 62-yearold man with past medical history of obstructive sleep apnea on Continuous Positive Airway Pressure therapy, sinusitis, and hypothyroidism was referred to Pulmonary clinic for a persistent cough of one month's duration. Recent history was notable for a viral illness with cough, fever, and dyspnea, leading to a diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. He required one week of hospitalization and brief mechanical ventilation support. After clinical improvement, he was discharged home at the end of March 2020. His shortness of breath and fatigue improved, but his cough continued. He was seen at the end of April 2020, after a repeat SARS-CoV-2 test was positive. He was treated for a post-viral cough symptomatically with inhaled fluticasone and benzonatate. COVID antibody testing showed SARS-CoV-2 IgG present. After 3 weeks of symptomatic treatment (May 2020), there was no clinical improvement. The chest radiograph was normal. He was treated for gastroesophageal reflux with a proton pump inhibitor and a course of prednisone. At follow-up in June 2020, pulmonary function testing results were within normal limits without obstructive or restrictive airflow limitation. His cough decreased with prednisone course (40 mg for five days), only to recur when the prednisone course was complete-a total of three prednisone courses prescribed over a month and a half. At the end of July, after two months of chronic cough, CT imaging of the chest was performed. CT imaging showed a pattern of lung disease consistent with organizing pneumonia.","Glass, L.

We investigated this behavior when fears of consumer market disruptions started circulating, to capture human behavior in this unique situation. Based on the stimulus-organism-response (S-O-R) framework, we propose a structural model connecting exposure to online information sources (environmental stimuli) to two behavioral responses: unusual purchases and voluntary self-isolation. To test the proposed model, we collected data from 211 Finnish respondents via an online survey, and carried out analysis using PLS-SEM. We found a strong link between self-intention to self-isolate and intention to make unusual purchases, providing empirical evidence that the reported consumer behavior was directly linked to anticipated time spent in self-isolation. The results further revealed exposure to online information sources led to increased information overload and cyberchondria. Information overload was also a strong predictor of cyberchondria. Perceived severity of the situation and cyberchondria had significant impacts on people's intention to make unusual purchases and voluntarily self-isolate. Future research is needed to confirm the long-term effects of the pandemic on consumer and retail services.","Laato, Samuli; Islam, A.K.M. Najmul; Farooq, Ali; Dhir, Amandeep",J. Retail. Consum.

To observe the Covid-19 protocols of social distancing, the research instrument was designed using google forms and distributed to respondents via social media platforms (emails and WhatsApp). The results revealed that caregiving mothers generally reported to work late from home than if there were in the office and were less effective and productive working from home but were assured of job security because they mostly worked in the public sector. Hours used for domestic activities rose steadily during the lockdown period and social support from non-relatives in caregiving increased. The paper?s finding suggests that mothers working from home are faced with difficult and conflicting roles which puts more pressure on women during the pandemic period. Women who are unable to access social support continue to be stressed and burdened in an attempt to combine family, care giving, and career roles which ultimately affect their overall wellbeing.

Elective surgeries, including orthopedic surgery, were deferred worldwide, allowing hospitals to accommodate higher numbers of COVID-19 patients and reduce the possible risk of infection among healthcare workers. However, healthcare systems aimed to continue providing emergency services at similar standards. In this study, we aim to highlight the impact of lockdowns secondary to the pandemic on orthopedic trauma practice in a country that was described to have one of the strictest lockdowns worldwide. We aim to examine the trends of change in number and type of orthopedic trauma cases and the changes to decision making and patient care among orthopedic surgeons.","Altamimi, A. A. R.; Al-Omari, A.

State-of-the-art approaches to social navigation fall into two categories: model-based social constraints and learning-based approaches. While effective, these approaches have fundamental limitations -- model-based approaches require constraint and parameter tuning to adapt to preferences and new scenarios, while learning-based approaches require reward functions, significant training data, and are hard to adapt to new social scenarios or new domains with limited demonstrations. In this work, we propose Iterative Dimension Informed Program Synthesis (IDIPS) to address these limitations by learning and adapting social navigation in the form of human-readable symbolic programs. IDIPS works by combining program synthesis, parameter optimization, predicate repair, and iterative human demonstration to learn and adapt model-free action selection policies from orders of magnitude less data than learning-based approaches. We introduce a novel predicate repair technique that can accommodate previously unseen social scenarios or preferences by growing existing policies. We present experimental results showing that IDIPS: 1) synthesizes effective policies that model user preference, 2) can adapt existing policies to changing preferences, 3) can extend policies to handle novel social scenarios such as locked doors, and 4) generates policies that can be transferred from simulation to real-world robots with minimal effort.","Holtz, Jarrett; Andrews, Simon; Guha, Arjun; Biswas, Joydeep",,425,1

Several vaccine trial designs may significantly accelerate vaccine testing and approval, but also increase risks to human subjects. Concerns about whether the public would see such designs as ethical represent an important roadblock to their implementation; accordingly, both the World Health Organization and numerous scholars have called for consulting the public regarding them. We answered these calls by conducting a cross-national survey (n = 5920) in Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, New Zealand, South Africa, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The survey explained key differences between traditional vaccine trials and two accelerated designs: a challenge trial or a trial integrating a Phase II safety and immunogenicity trial into a larger Phase III efficacy trial. Respondents' answers to comprehension questions indicate that they largely understood the key differences and ethical trade-offs between the designs from our descriptions. We asked respondents whether they would prefer scientists to conduct traditional trials or one of these two accelerated designs. We found broad majorities prefer for scientists to conduct challenge trials (75%) and integrated trials (63%) over standard trials. Even as respondents acknowledged the risks, they perceived both accelerated trials as similarly ethical to standard trial designs. This high support is consistent across every geography and demographic subgroup we examined, including vulnerable populations. These findings may help assuage some of the concerns surrounding accelerated designs.","Broockman, David; Kalla, Joshua; Guerrero, Alexander; Budolfson, Mark; Eyal, Nir; Jewell, Nicholas P; Magalhaes, Monica; Sekhon, Jasjeet S",Vaccine,425,16

There is an urgent need to develop sensitive and online methods for on-site diagnosing and monitoring of suspected COVID-19 patients. With the huge development of Internet of Things (IoT), the impact of Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) provides an impressive solution to this problem. In this paper, we proposed a 5G-enabled fluorescence sensor for quantitative detection of spike protein and nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 by using mesoporous silica encapsulated up-conversion nanoparticles (UCNPs@mSiO2) labeled lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA). The sensor can detect spike protein (SP) with a detection of limit (LOD) 1.6 ng/mL and nucleocapsid protein (NP) with an LOD of 2.2 ng/mL. The feasibility of the sensor in clinical use was further demonstrated by utilizing virus culture as real clinical samples. Moreover, the proposed fluorescence sensor is IoMT enabled, which is accessible to edge hardware devices (personal computers, 5G smartphones, IPTV, etc.) through Bluetooth. Medical data can be transmitted to the fog layer of the network and 5G cloud server with ultra-low latency and high reliably for edge computing and big data analysis. Furthermore, a COVID-19 monitoring module working with the proposed the system is developed on a smartphone application (App), which endows patients and their families to record their medical data and daily conditions remotely, releasing the burdens of going to central hospitals. We believe that the proposed system will be highly practical in the future treatment and prevention of COVID-19 and other mass infectious diseases.","Guo, Jiuchuan; Chen, Shuqin; Tian, Shulin; Liu, Ke; Ni, Jian; Zhao, Ming; Kang, Yuejun; Ma, Xing; Guo, Jinhong",Biosens Bioelectron,425,26
369180,369180,369180,Surgical Critical Care at the Epicenter of the COVID-19 Pandemic,19.245731,6.287116,2020,"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19, enters human cells by binding of its viral protein to the aminopeptidase angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). This has led to speculation whether treatment with renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors was associated with an increased likelihood of a positive test for COVID-19 and risk of mortality. AIMS: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate whether RAS inhibitors increased the likelihood of a positive test or death/severe illness in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: A systematic search of MEDLINE, PubMed and EMBASE was conducted for studies stratified by the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB). Pooled analysis was performed using a random-effects model. RESULTS: Seven trials of 73 122 patients were included. Overall, 16 624 (22.7%) patients had a positive COVID-19 test and 7892 (10.8%) were on a RAS inhibitor. RAS inhibitors were not associated with higher likelihood of a positive COVID-19 test result (odds ratio (OR) 0.97 (95% CI 0.97-1.05, P = 0.48) with low heterogeneity. This was comparable when stratifying by use of each medication class. The use of RAS inhibitors was also not associated with mortality or severe illness (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.73-1.07, P = 0.21) with moderate heterogeneity. CONCLUSION: Use of ACEI or ARB was not associated with a heightened susceptibility for a positive diagnosis of COVID-19. Furthermore, they were not associated with increased illness severity or mortality due to COVID-19. Randomised controlled trials are needed to address definitively the potential benefits or harms of RAS inhibitors in patients with COVID-19.","Koshy, Anoop N; Murphy, Alexandra C; Farouque, Omar; Ramchand, Jay; Burrell, Louise M; Yudi, Matias B",Intern. med. j,425,25

While a major current focus in vaccine acceptance research is how to model and inform vaccine acceptance based on social-demographic parameters, characteristics of vaccine acceptance are not well understood and in particular, it is not known whether and how information diffusion influences vaccine acceptance. This study examines how information diffusion can change vaccine acceptance by developing a comprehensive computational model with an agent-based simulation technique to overcome the modeling and quantification complexity associated with socio-demographics, vaccine types, population statistics, and information diffusion. Our analyses, calibrated by the vaccine acceptance survey data from the provinces and territories of Canada, provide clear evidence that the propagation of information can greatly influence vaccine acceptance rates. The results illustrate that spread of negative messages about the COVID-19 vaccines can cause significant vaccine hesitancy that challenges the goal of a high public immunity provided by the vaccines.

This outcome was troubling as it portended a potentially cynical public audience in the event of a future emerging infectious disease. As we face a new Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) with COVID-19, public trust in public health information and mediated messaging is more important than ever. Health authorities aim to inform the public through various avenues, particularly by engaging news media as a bridge to deliver pertinent information. We draw on the Trust, Confidence, and Cooperation (TCC) Model to examine how citizens and health officers evaluated news coverage of the H1N1 pandemic in Canada and the impact it had on public trust in public health recommendations. Following the H1N1 pandemic, we conducted interviews (n = 28) with senior health officials in Canadian federal and provincial jurisdictions and focus groups with general population Canadians (n = 130) in three provinces. Findings showed that many health officials and members of the public considered that the pandemic H1N1 was hyped in news coverage and that the immunization campaign was portrayed as chaotic, potentially affecting trust in pandemic messaging and response activities. Our results highlight the key role of news coverage in pandemic communication. Further, we recommend that health authorities complement their media engagement with direct communication with citizens;and increased training for public health officers to engage with news media and promote public trust.

There have been studies on the COVID-19 to find a certain treatment, but yet, there is no certain cure. In this article, we present a possible way to treat severe cases of COVID-19. Based on the previous studies, there are similarities between the spike antigens of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 viruses. It is expected that these similarities (structural and affinity to the receptor of ACE2) can lead to the same pathophysiological activity of the virus by the use of ACE2 and FcÎ³RII (the antibody-dependent enhancement mechanism). Therefore, we propose a way of washing out (by plasmapheresis) the possible antibodies against the spike protein of the virus out of patients' plasma to stop the antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE)-mediated infection of the immune system cells at the first phase of the treatment and simultaneous use of the anti-ACE2 with anti-FcÎ³RII monoclonal antibodies at the second phase.

We validate the framework by (a) showing appropriate convergence analysis and (b) computing the drag coefficient for flow past a sphere for a wide range of Reynolds numbers ($\mathcal{O}(1-10^6)$) encompassing the drag crisis regime. Finally, we deploy the framework on a realistic geometry on a current project to evaluate COVID-19 transmission risk in classrooms.","Saurabh, Kumar; Ishii, Masado; Fernando, Milinda; Gao, Boshun; Tan, Kendrick; Hsu, Ming-Chen; Krishnamurthy, Adarsh; Sundar, Hari; Ganapathysubramanian, Baskar",,425,18

In the present research, the author evaluated amino acid sequences, its abundance and GC content of the genes that corresponds to envelope proteins' of the human coronaviruses, identified from year 2003-2019. It includes SARS-CoV (2003), HCoV-NL-63 (2003), HCoV-HKU-1 (2004), MERSCoV (2013), and SARS-CoV-2 (2019). The present research findings illustrated a point mutation in D2 location of SARS-CoV-2 (2019), representing Arginine in the place of Glutamic acid (SARS-CoV, 2003) where glycine was found deleted. SARS-CoV-2 (2019) coronavirus revealed increased abundance of Glutamic acid (100%), Asparagine (67%), Serine (300%) and Valine (85.7%) in comparison with HCoVNL-63 (2003). We observed lower GC content in the SARS-CoV-2 (2019) among SARS-CoV (2003) and MERS-CoV (2013). The present findings have evolutionary significance and indicate SARS-CoV-2 (2019) adaptation in human.

Here we report a 2.1-Å structure and the drug-binding site of E's transmembrane domain (ETM), determined using solid-state NMR spectroscopy. In lipid bilayers that mimic the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) membrane, ETM forms a five-helix bundle surrounding a narrow pore. The protein deviates from the ideal &#945;-helical geometry due to three phenylalanine residues, which stack within each helix and between helices. Together with valine and leucine interdigitation, these cause a dehydrated pore compared with the viroporins of influenza viruses and HIV. Hexamethylene amiloride binds the polar amino-terminal lumen, whereas acidic pH affects the carboxy-terminal conformation. Thus, the N- and C-terminal halves of this bipartite channel may interact with other viral and host proteins semi-independently. The structure sets the stage for designing E inhibitors as antiviral drugs.","Mandala, Venkata S; McKay, Matthew J; Shcherbakov, Alexander A; Dregni, Aurelio J; Kolocouris, Antonios; Hong, Mei",Nat Struct Mol Biol,425,16

METHODS: This study used cohort and cross sectional data from an academic primary care division in Southcentral Pennsylvania that serves approximately 17,500 patients across 4 practice sites. Early season (prior to November 1) vaccination rates in 2018, 2019 and 2020 were recorded for children, age 6 months to 17 years. To explore the impact of COVID-19 on vaccination, we fit a model with a logit link (estimated via generalized estimating equations to account for clustering by patient over time) on calendar year, adjusted for race, ethnicity, age, and insurance type. We examined interaction effects of demographic covariates with calendar year. RESULTS: Early vaccination rates were lower in 2020 (29.7%) compared with 2018 and 2019 (34.2% and 33.3%). After adjusting for covariates and accounting for clustering over time, the odds of early vaccination in 2020 were 19% lower compared to 2018 (OR 0.81, 95% CI: 0.78-0.85). In 2020, children with private insurance were more likely to receive early vaccination than in 2018 (OR 1.51, 95% CI: 1.04-1.15), whereas children with public insurance were less likely to receive early vaccination in 2020 than in 2018 (OR 0.62, 95% CI: 1.38-1.65). CONCLUSIONS: Early influenza vaccination rates declined in a year with a concurrent COVID-19 pandemic. Modeling that accounts for individual trends and demographic variables identified specific populations with lower odds of early vaccination in 2020. Additional research is needed to investigate whether the COVID-19 pandemic impacted parental intent to obtain the influenza vaccine, or introduced barriers to healthcare access.","Fogel, Benjamin; Schaefer, Eric W; Hicks, Steven D",Vaccine,425,0

In this study, we analyzed cell-free DNA (cfDNA) as a biomarker of injury to define the sources of tissue injury that contribute to such different trajectories.METHODSWe conducted a multicenter prospective cohort study to enroll patients with COVID-19 and collect plasma samples. Plasma cfDNA was subject to bisulfite sequencing. A library of tissue-specific DNA methylation signatures was used to analyze sequence reads to quantitate cfDNA from different tissue types. We then determined the correlation of tissue-specific cfDNA measures to COVID-19 outcomes. Similar analyses were performed for healthy controls and a comparator group of patients with respiratory syncytial virus and influenza.RESULTSWe found markedly elevated levels and divergent tissue sources of cfDNA in COVID-19 patients compared with patients who had influenza and/or respiratory syncytial virus and with healthy controls. The major sources of cfDNA in COVID-19 were hematopoietic cells, vascular endothelium, hepatocytes, adipocytes, kidney, heart, and lung. cfDNA levels positively correlated with COVID-19 disease severity, C-reactive protein, and D-dimer. cfDNA profile at admission identified patients who subsequently required intensive care or died during hospitalization. Furthermore, the increased cfDNA in COVID-19 patients generated excessive mitochondrial ROS (mtROS) in renal tubular cells in a concentration-dependent manner. This mtROS production was inhibited by a TLR9-specific antagonist.CONCLUSIONcfDNA maps tissue injury that predicts COVID-19 outcomes and may mechanistically propagate COVID-19-induced tissue injury.FUNDINGIntramural Targeted Anti-COVID-19 grant, NIH.","Andargie, Temesgen E; Tsuji, Naoko; Seifuddin, Fayaz; Jang, Moon Kyoo; Yuen, Peter St; Kong, Hyesik; Tunc, Ilker; Singh, Komudi; Charya, Ananth; Wilkins, Kenneth; Nathan, Steven; Cox, Andrea; Pirooznia, Mehdi; Star, Robert A; Agbor-Enoh, Sean",JCI insight,425,16

Extensive numerical analysis based on transfer matrix theory as well as finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) technique has been performed to characterize the sensor response considering sensitivity, full width at half maxima, and minimum reflection. About 7.6 times enhanced sensitivity has been obtained using the proposed architecture for SARS-CoV-2 detection, compared to the basic Kretschmann configuration. Notably, the structure provides consistent enhancement over other competitive SPR structures for both angular and wavelength interrogations with a figure-of-merit of 692.28. Additionally, we repeated simulations for various ligate-ligand pairs to assess the range of applicability and robust performance improvement has been observed. As a result, the proposed sensor design provides a suitable configuration for highly sensitive, rapid, noninvasive biosensing which can be useful if adopted in experimental sensing protocols.","Uddin, Syed Mohammad Ashab; Chowdhury, Sayeed Shafayet; Kabir, Ehsan",Plasmonics,425,21

It was first described by Lask in 1991 (Arch Dis Child 66:866-869, 1991). Recently, Otasowie and Collaborators reported a systematic review about PRS. Despite this, PRS has not yet been classified in DSM-5 and ICD-11 and the lack of evidence-based treatment makes this syndrome a real challenge for clinicians. The aim of this paper is to present our experience through the description of a case report and its treatment. METHODS AND RESULTS: The case reported is a girl aged 11 years that fits the clinical picture described in the literature of PRS. In previous reports, behavioural treatment was not used or appreciated; our case adds new knowledge regarding the PRS diagnosis and the successful behavioural treatment during hospitalization, which we describe in all its phases. CONCLUSION: PRS is a rare, life-threatening syndrome; it would be extremely important to have an official and evidence-based treatment guide.

ABLE is a generic, home-based, individualised, 8-week occupational therapy intervention program, developed to be delivered in Danish municipalities. In a previous study, the feasibility of ABLE was evaluated in terms of content and delivery. In this pilot study, the remaining feasibility aspects of a randomised controlled trial including (i) trial procedures (recruitment and retention), (ii) randomisation, (iii) adherence to program, (iv) feasibility of additional outcome measurements, and (iv) access to information on usual occupational therapy were evaluated. METHODS: The study was conducted in a Danish municipality, using a two-armed parallel randomised controlled design, planning a recruitment strategy including 20 persons living with one/more chronic conditions and experiencing problems performing ADL. The following progression criteria were used to determine if a future full-scale randomised controlled trial was feasible: (i) recruitment (50% met the eligibility criteria) and retention (80%), (ii) randomisation (80% accepted randomisation, procedure was executed as planned), (iii) adherence to program (100% followed the treatment protocol), (iv) outcome measurements (80% of the participants delivered relevantly and fully answered questionnaires), and (v) usual occupational therapy (extraction of needed information was successful). RESULTS: Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the study was truncated resulting in limited but sufficient data to answer most of the study questions. (i) Eighteen of 37 eligible persons (48.6%) were recruited; of those treated (n = 6), all remained (100%); (ii) 18 accepted randomisation (100%), and procedure was effective; (iii) ABLE was delivered with adherence (100%); (iv) 92.3-100% of the participants gave relevant and complete answers in two of three questionnaires; and (v) needed information on usual occupational therapy was extractable in seven of nine aspects. CONCLUSIONS: Proceeding to full-scale trial is recommendable; however, a few adjustments on outcome measurements, inclusion criteria and extraction of information on usual occupational therapy are needed.

The data was collected from a large-scale survey conducted in June 2020 after the highest point. Random utility maximization (RUM), random regret minimization (RRM) and generalized regret minimization (GRRM) are employed to examine the effects of various factors on mode choice behaviors. The estimation results reveal that regret aversion psychology doesn't have a dominant proportion of decision choices, even if the congested condition of the mass mobility plays a significant role in the consideration of decision-making. Combined with the statistical results from the official departments, we concluded that public transport displays a great propensity on the long trip, and meanwhile, the industry of ride-hailing services has shocked sharply.

Reports of COVID-19 with central (CNS) and peripheral nervous (PNS) system manifestations are emerging. In this systematic review, we compared and summarized the demographics, clinical features, Brighton criteria, immunological and laboratory findings with a focus on modified Erasmus GBS Outcome Score (mEGOS) in SARS-CoV-2 patients with GBS and its variants. METHODS: Based on PRISMA guidelines, we searched three databases (PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar) for studies on COVID-19 and GBS between December 1, 2019 to July 15, 2020. For descriptive analysis, we studied two groups with: 1) acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (AIDP) variant, and 2) Non-AIDP/Other variants. We compared mEGOS scores for patients in both groups along with other key clinical features. RESULTS: Of the 50 GBS cases identified from 37 studies, 33 (66%) had acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculopolyneuropathy (AIDP) while 17 (34%) were of other (non-AIDP) variants. There mEGOS scores did not differ between AIDP patients and AMAN/AMSAN patients. Majority of the AIDP (66.7%) and AMAN/AMSAN (57.2%) patients belonged to Brighton level 1 indicating maximum diagnostic certainty. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is among the first reviews that includes GBS variants and the clinical prediction tool mEGOS for prognostication in COVID-19 patients. Further research is needed to assess whether IVIG is preferable over plasmapheresis in this population of GBS patients. It would also be crucial to follow these patients over time to identify the long-term disability as well as treatment outcomes.","Sriwastava, Shitiz; Kataria, Saurabh; Tandon, Medha; Patel, Jenil; Patel, Riddhi; Jowkar, Abbas; Daimee, Maha; Bernitsas, Evanthia; Jaiswal, Preeti; Lisak, Robert P",J Neurol Sci,425,20

METHODS: Retrospective cohort study (March 3 to May 2, 2020). Patients were categorized according to the followed clinical management, as maximum care or limited therapeutic effort (LTE). Main outcomes were all-cause mortality and need for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). Baseline factors associated with outcomes were analyzed by multiple logistic regression, estimating odds ratios (OR; 95%CI). RESULTS: Thirty-hundred and six patients were hospitalized, median age 65.0 years, 57.8% males, 53.3% Charlson index &#8805;3. The overall all-cause fatality rate was 15.0% (n = 46). Maximum care was provided in 238 (77.8%), IMV was used in 38 patients (16.0%), and 5.5% died. LTE was decided in 68 patients (22.2%), none received IMV and fatality was 48.5%. Independent risk factors of mortality under maximum care were lymphocytes <790/mm3, troponin T >15ng/L and hypotension. Advanced age, lymphocytes <790/mm3 and BNP >240pg/mL independently associated with IMV requirement. CONCLUSION: Overall fatality in the cohort was 15% but markedly varied regarding the decided approach (maximum care versus LTE), translating into nine-fold higher mortality and different risk factors.","Andrés, Mariano; Leon-Ramirez, Jose-Manuel; Moreno-Perez, Oscar; Sánchez-Payá, José; Gayá, Ignacio; Esteban, Violeta; Ribes, Isabel; Torrus-Tendero, Diego; González-de-la-Aleja, Pilar; Llorens, Pere; Boix, Vicente; Gil, Joan; Merino, Esperanza",PLoS One,425,1

Supplementary data were obtained from the Medicare Benefit Schedule (MBS) to compare health services activity data provided by different health professionals before and after COVID-19 (from January 2019 to June 2020).ResultsThere was variation in access to different health services by patients with chronic conditions during COVID-19. The introduction of telehealth facilitated continuity of general practitioner (GP) services, with a high level of satisfaction among patients. Changes in medicines regulation, including the home delivery of medications, enabled timely access to medications for patients. The use of telehealth was less common for specialist and particularly allied health services. Dental check-ups that are important for the management of some chronic conditions were disrupted the most during COVID-19.ConclusionThe findings of this study suggest that the policy measures introduced in Australia provided an opportunity to maintain multidisciplinary care for patients with chronic diseases during COVID-19. GPs, as core members of the primary healthcare team, as well as pharmacy and pathology services, were highly accessible. Telehealth was less accessed for chronic care services provided by specialists and allied health professionals.What is known about the topic?Access to multidisciplinary care is critical to ensure continuity and quality of care for patients with chronic health conditions. Evidence suggests disruptions in health services can occur during pandemics. To continue access to routine care, the Australian Government introduced several policy initiatives during COVID-19 to enhance access to multidisciplinary care.What does this paper add?Telehealth policy was particularly effective in facilitating patients' access to general practice services during COVID-19 particularly those services that did not need physical examinations. This policy complemented changes in medicines regulations that enabled timely and convenient access to medications for patients with chronic conditions. Allied health services, as important elements of multidisciplinary care, were more likely to be disrupted during COVID-19.What are the implications for practitioners?Continuation of telehealth services is likely to enhance access to general practice services. The acceptability and use of telehealth for allied health services may require more flexibility, and training for both practitioners and patients.","Javanparast, Sara; Roeger, Leigh; Reed, Richard L",,425,13

Following Hyland's framework of stance, this study investigated the distribution of stance markers in two different genres: medical research articles (medical RA) and newspaper opinion columns (newspaper OC). The corpus constructed for the investigation includes 52 medical research articles and 175 newspaper opinion articles, which were both written in English and published from January to April in 2020 with the topic focusing on COVID-19. The findings of this study demonstrated that the occurrences of stance markers in newspaper OC were far more frequent than those in medical RA, indicating the different conventions of these two genres. Despite the significant difference in the occurrences of stance markers between the two sub-corpora, similarities of the most frequent stance markers in two genres were also highlighted. The study indicated that the topic content seems to play an important role in shaping the way of how writers construct their stance. The lack of information or evidence on the topic of COVID-19 could restrain writers from making high degree of commitment to their claims, which make them adopt a more tentative stance to qualify their statements.","Shen, Qian; Tao, Yating",PLoS One,425,5

Consequently, it is not surprising that ones related to the COVID-19 pandemic are proliferating given the lack of scientific consensus on the virus's spread and containment, or on the long-term social and economic ramifications of the pandemic. Among the stories currently circulating in US-focused social media forums are ones suggesting that the 5G telecommunication network activates the virus, that the pandemic is a hoax perpetrated by a global cabal, that the virus is a bio-weapon released deliberately by the Chinese, or that Bill Gates is using it as cover to launch a broad vaccination program to facilitate a global surveillance regime. While some may be quick to dismiss these stories as having little impact on real-world behavior, recent events including the destruction of cell phone towers, racially fueled attacks against Asian Americans, demonstrations espousing resistance to public health orders, and wide-scale defiance of scientifically sound public mandates such as those to wear masks and practice social distancing, countermand such conclusions. Inspired by narrative theory, we crawl social media sites and news reports and, through the application of automated machine-learning methods, discover the underlying narrative frameworks supporting the generation of rumors and conspiracy theories. We show how the various narrative frameworks fueling these stories rely on the alignment of otherwise disparate domains of knowledge, and consider how they attach to the broader reporting on the pandemic. These alignments and attachments, which can be monitored in near real time, may be useful for identifying areas in the news that are particularly vulnerable to reinterpretation by conspiracy theorists. Understanding the dynamics of storytelling on social media and the narrative frameworks that provide the generative basis for these stories may also be helpful for devising methods to disrupt their spread.","Shahsavari, Shadi; Holur, Pavan; Wang, Tianyi; Tangherlini, Timothy R; Roychowdhury, Vwani",J Comput Soc Sci,425,4

Cross sectional study conducted among patients between 18-60 years. Demographics, access to pain killers, dental care (yes/no), duration (> 15 days) and intensity of pain were self reported. Fear of COVID-19 was assessed using fear of corona virus scale (FCV-19S); psychological distress in the last 30 days and oral health related quality of life was evaluated.

For most of such constructions, pedigree analysis was applied to evaluate the system effectiveness of a certain panel. However, such analyses were hard to be compared to each other and could be affected by many factors, such as sample size and sampling randomness. A new indicator named predicted area under ROC curve (AUCP), where ROC curve stood for receiver operating characteristic curve, was derived applying binomial distribution theory and analyzed with simulated and real cases in this study. After comparing between the values of AUCPs and results of pedigree analyses with different loci sets and kinship types, the ability of these two methods evaluating the system effectiveness was proved to be close to each other. The implementation of AUCP was much easier than pedigree analysis, because a secondary sampling or simulation was not needed. Therefore, AUCP can be a better indicator for panels targeted to pairwise distant kinship identification and we are recommending it as an indicator calculated by default for such panels.","Ma, Guanju; Cong, Bin; Li, Shujin",Forensic Sci Int,425,24

We also investigated whether COVID‐19 is associated with a different clinical picture or a more severe course of illness in PWE (compared with others).MethodsAll consecutive patients who referred to and admitted at healthcare facilities anywhere in Fars province (located in the south of Iran with a population of 4,851,000 people) from February 19, 2020 until November 20, 2020 were included.ResultsA total of 37,968 patients were studied. Eighty‐two patients (0.2%) had pre‐existing epilepsy. Seizures were significantly more frequent among PWE as a presenting manifestation of COVID‐19 compared with that in people without epilepsy (Odds Ratio = 27;p = 0.0001). Furthermore, PWE less often reported cough (significantly) and more often had gastrointestinal symptoms (vomiting and anorexia;as trends) compared with those in people without epilepsy. Patients with epilepsy were not differently likely to be intubated or admitted at ICUs. Case fatality rates were not different between the two groups [9.8% in PWE and 8.5% in people without epilepsy;p = 0.690].ConclusionPatients with epilepsy are not susceptible to contracting COVID‐19 more than other individuals. Furthermore, COVID‐19 in PWE is not associated with a more severe illness or a poorer prognosis. However, PWE and COVID‐19 may present somewhat differently than others with such an illness. Why PWE less often present with cough and more often present with gastrointestinal symptoms is not clear yet and should be investigated and clarified in the future studies.","Ali, A.

Current pharmacologic treatments and mechanical ventilation have limited value in targeting the underlying pathophysiology of ARDS. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have shown potent therapeutic advantages in experimental and clinical trials through direct cell-to-cell interaction and paracrine signaling. However, safety concerns and the indeterminate effects of MSCs have resulted in the investigation of MSC-derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) due to their low immunogenicity and tumorigenicity. Over the past decades, soluble proteins, microRNAs, and organelles packaged in EVs have been identified as efficacious molecules to orchestrate nearby immune responses, which attenuate acute lung injury by facilitating pulmonary epithelium repair, reducing acute inflammation, and restoring pulmonary vascular leakage.

This critical first step occurs in dynamic environments, where external forces act on the binding partners and multivalent interactions play critical roles, creating an urgent need for assays that can quantitate SARS-CoV-2 interactions with ACE2 under mechanical load and in defined geometries. Here, we introduce a tethered ligand assay that comprises the RBD and the ACE2 ectodomain joined by a flexible peptide linker. Using magnetic tweezers and atomic force spectroscopy as highly complementary single-molecule force spectroscopy techniques, we investigate the RBD:ACE2 interaction over the whole physiologically relevant force range. We combine the experimental results with steered molecular dynamics simulations and observe and assign fully consistent unbinding and unfolding events across the three techniques, enabling us to establish ACE2 unfolding as a molecular fingerprint. Measuring at forces of 2-5 pN, we quantify the force dependence and kinetics of the RBD:ACE2 bond in equilibrium. We show that the SARS-CoV-2 RBD:ACE2 interaction has higher mechanical stability, larger binding free energy, and a lower dissociation rate in comparison to SARS-CoV-1, which helps to rationalize the different infection patterns of the two viruses. By studying how free ACE2 outcompetes tethered ACE2, we show that our assay is sensitive to prevention of bond formation by external binders. We expect our results to provide a novel way to investigate the roles of mutations and blocking agents for targeted pharmaceutical intervention.","Bauer, Magnus S.; Gruber, Sophia; Hausch, Adina; Milles, Lukas F.; Nicolaus, Thomas; Schendel, Leonard C.; Navajas, Pilar Lopez; Procko, Erik; Lietha, Daniel; Bernardi, Rafael C.; Gaub, Hermann E.; Lipfert, Jan",,425,14

We evaluated the use of D-dimer on all hospital admissions during the peak of the pandemic and evaluated its sensitivity in diagnosing pulmonary embolic disease (PE). Patients without COVID-19 infection were as likely to have evidence of PE as their COVID-positive counterparts. However, the sensitivity of a D-dimer was higher in COVID-positive patients at a lower D-dimer level (>1,500 µg/L, sensitivity 81%, specificity 70%) than in those without clinical, immunological or radiological evidence of COVID-19 infection (D-dimer >2,000 µg/L, sensitivity 80%, specificity 76%).

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) uses an RdRP for the replication of its genome and the transcription of its genes. Here, the silver ions (Ag+) in the hexathia-18-crown-6 (HT18C6) were used for the first time as a redox probe. Then, the HT18C6(Ag) incorporated carbon paste electrode (CPE) was further modified with chitosan and PAMAM dendrimer-coated silicon quantum dots (SiQDs@PAMAM) for immobilization of probe sequences (aminated oligonucleotides). The current intensity of differential pulse voltammetry using the redox probe was found to decrease with increasing the concentration of target sequence. Based on such signal-off trend, the proposed genosensor exhibited a good linear response to SARS-CoV-2 RdRP in the concentration range 1.0 pM-8.0 nM with a regression equation I (µA) = - 6.555 log [RdRP sequence] (pM) + 32.676 (R2 = 0.995) and a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.3 pM. The standard addition method with different spike concentrations of RdRP sequence in human sputum samples showed a good recovery for real sample analysis (> 95%). Therefore, the developed voltammetric genosensor can be used to determine SARS-CoV-2 RdRP sequence in sputum samples. PAMAM-functionalized SiQDs were used as a versatile electrochemical platform for the SARS-CoV-2 RdRP detection based on a signal off sensing strategy.

To easily and rapidly measure titers of neutralizing antibodies in serum or plasma, we developed pseudovirion particles composed of the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 incorporated onto murine leukemia virus capsids and a modified minimal murine leukemia virus genome encoding firefly luciferase. This assay design is intended for use in laboratories with biocontainment level 2 and therefore circumvents the need for the biocontainment level 3 that would be required for replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 virus. To validate the pseudovirion assay, we set up comparisons with other available antibody tests including those from Abbott, Euroimmun and Siemens, using archived, known samples. RESULTS: 11 out of 12 SARS-CoV-2-infected patient serum samples showed neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2-spike pseudotyped MLV viruses, with neutralizing titers-50 (NT50) that ranged from 1:25 to 1:1,417. Five historical samples from patients hospitalized for severe influenza infection in 2016 tested negative in the neutralization assay (NT50 < 25). Three serum samples with high neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2/MLV pseudoviruses showed no detectable neutralizing activity (NT50 < 25) against SARS-CoV-1/MLV pseudovirions. We also compared the semiquantitative Siemens SARS-CoV-2 IgG test, which measures binding of IgG to recombinantly expressed receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein with the neutralization titers obtained in the pseudovirion assay and the results show high concordance between the two tests (R2 = 0.9344). CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 spike/MLV pseudovirions provide a practical means of assessing neutralizing activity of antibodies in serum or plasma from infected patients under laboratory conditions consistent with biocontainment level 2. This assay offers promise also in evaluating immunogenicity of spike glycoprotein-based candidate vaccines in the near future.","Zheng, Yue; Larragoite, Erin T; Williams, Elizabeth S C P; Lama, Juan; Cisneros, Isabel; Delgado, Julio C; Slev, Patricia; Rychert, Jenna; Innis, Emily A; Coiras, Mayte; Rondina, Matthew T; Spivak, Adam M; Planelles, Vicente",Virol J,425,12

During the COVID-19 pandemic confinement period, with a cut off in transportation as well as in occupational and physical activities, we observed a decrease in medical and elective surgical activities but emergency cases of upper limb and hand surgery increased. MATERIALS AND METHODS: we conducted a retrospective epidemiological study to analyze two periods between the same dates in 2019 and 2020, for all the duration of the confinement period. We compared the numbers of consultations in the emergency department, elective surgeries, hand and upper limb emergency cases in our center and urgent limb surgeries in the nearby hospital. Then we compared the mechanisms and severity of injuries and the type of surgery. RESULTS: between 2019 and 2020 there was a decrease of consultations in the emergency department in our institution of 52%, a decrease of total elective surgeries of 75%, a decrease in surgeries for urgent peripheral limb injuries of 50%, whereas the hand and upper limb emergency remained stable or even increased by 4% regard to occupational and domestic accidents. There was a significant difference in the mechanism of injury with an increase of domestic accident and a decrease of occupational, road traffic and sport accidents. Severity of the injuries increased, with augmentation of the number of tissues involved and longer expected time of recovery. CONCLUSION: during the confinement period of the COVID-19 pandemic, despite an important reduction of medical activities, the amount and severity of hand emergency cases increased.

Transfection agents are widely considered to be necessary to protect mRNA and enhance transfection, but they add expense and raise concerns regarding quality control and safety. We found that such complex mRNA delivery systems can be avoided when transfecting epithelial cells by aerosolizing the mRNA into micron-sized droplets. In an equine in vivo model, we demonstrated that the translation of mRNA into a functional protein did not depend on the addition of a polyethylenimine (PEI)-derived transfection agent. We were able to safely and effectively transfect the bronchial epithelium of foals using naked mRNA (i.e., mRNA formulated in a sodium citrate buffer without a delivery vehicle). Endoscopic examination of the bronchial tree and histology of mucosal biopsies indicated no gross or microscopic adverse effects of the transfection.

The purpose of this study was to estimate national hospital reimbursement and net income losses due to elective orthopaedic surgery cancellation during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The National Inpatient Sample (NIS) and the Nationwide Ambulatory Surgery Sample (NASS) were used to identify all elective orthopaedic and musculoskeletal (MSK) surgery performed in the inpatient setting and in hospital owned outpatient surgery departments throughout the USA. Total cost, reimbursement, and net income were estimated for all elective orthopaedic surgery and were compared with elective operations from other specialties. RESULTS: Elective MSK surgery accounted for $65.6-$71.1 billion in reimbursement and $15.6-$21.1 billion in net income per year to the US hospital system, equivalent to $5.5-$5.9 billion in reimbursement and $1.3-$1.8 billion in net income per month. When compared with elective surgery from all other specialties, elective MSK surgery accounted for 39% of hospital reimbursement and 35% of hospital net income. Compared with all hospital encounters for all specialties, elective MSK surgery accounted for 13% of reimbursement and 23% of net income. Estimated hospital losses from cancellation of elective MSK surgery during 8 weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic were $10.9-$11.9 billion in reimbursement and $2.6-3.5 billion in net income. CONCLUSION: Cancellation of elective MSK surgery for 8 weeks during the COVID-19 pandemic has substantial economic implications on the US hospital system.","Best, Matthew J; Aziz, Keith T; McFarland, Edward G; Anderson, Gerard F; Srikumaran, Uma",Int Orthop,425,1

This review discusses racial-ethnic differences in COVID-19 related outcomes with an emphasis on the social determinants of health that are responsible for these disparities. RECENT FINDINGS: Higher hospitalizations and deaths have been reported amongst minority individuals after a COVID-19 infection. Cardiovascular disease and its risk factors are also more common in minority populations and negatively impact clinical outcomes after a COVID-19 illness. The racial disparities seen after COVID-19 infections appear to be driven by multiple preexisting comorbidities, adverse socioeconomic conditions, and lack of access to healthcare. These disadvantages were present before the COVID-19 pandemic. To effectively reduce disparities in outcomes of COVID-19 and the impact of the virus on minority communities, a multifaceted approach will be needed. SUMMARY: Government-backed policies that foster health equity and promote easily accessible testing and fair distribution of COVID-19 therapies and vaccines are necessary to successfully combat racial disparities in COVID-19 outcomes.","Aleligne, Yeabsra Kefyalew; Appiah, Duke; Ebong, Imo A",Curr Opin Cardiol,425,21

At present, there is no specific antiviral drug or vaccine for COVID-19. The pathogenic infectivity of the virus requires the S1 subunit of the spike (S) protein to bind the host cell receptor, angiontensin converting enzyme (ACE2). While the binding to host cell receptor is the first step of infection, the entrance of the virus into the cell needs the cleavage of S1-S2 subunits to expose S2 for fusion to cell membrane via host proteases including cathepsins, cell surface transmembrane protease/serine (TMPRSS) proteases, furin, trypsin and factor Xa. Previous in vitro studies have shown that factor Xa inhibition can decrease viral infectivity. We suppose that host cell proteases including furin (as expressed highly in lungs), factor Xa and cathepsin are possible targets to decrease viral burden, therefore unfractioned heparin and low molecular weight heparin-LMWH (specifically dalteparin and tinzaparin for their anti inflammatory action) can be potential inhibitors of multiple endoproteases involved in virus infectivity. Our hypothesis needs to be tested in in vitro and clinical studies, however as we are in an urgent situation as the burden of SARS-CoV2 is increasing all around the world, we recommend the usage of unfractioned heparin or LMWH in intensive care unit (ICU) and non-ICU hospitalized patients with the risk-benefit judgement of the clinician. Whether our hypothesis is clinically applicable and successful in decreasing viral infection will be evaluated for further studies.","Belen-Apak, F B; Sarialioglu, F",Med Hypotheses,425,4

Several lab parameters have been proposed to help guide clinical decisions. This study aimed to evaluate the association between troponin (TN), N-terminal pro-brain naturietic peptide (BNP), and sodium and adverse clinical outcomes in COVID-19.Methods: This retrospective single-center cohort included consecutive COVID-19 patients admitted to the George Washington University Hospital between March 2020 and May 2020. Patient demographics, cardiovascular comorbidities, and laboratory values were examined. Elevated TN and BNP were defined as &gt;0.02 ng/mL and &gt;150 ng/L, respectively. Primary outcomes included ICU admission and mortality. The presence of underlying cardiovascular disease (CVD) was analyzed to evaluate for relative effect on clinical outcomes. Chi-square and multinomial regression models were utilized to evaluate the association between biomarkers and clinical outcomes.Results: 290 patients were identified with a median age of 62 and the majority were male (52.4%), Black (71.3%), and had CVD risk factors (72.1%). ICU admission occurred in 88 (30.3%) while death occurred in 74 (25.5%) individuals. Patients with both an elevated TN and CVD were more likely to experience ICU admission or death (OR=2.55, p=0.017) while patients with both elevated TN and elevated BNP had markedly increased odds of ICU admission or death (OR=7.53, p&lt;0.001). Among patients with CVD, hypernatremia (Na&gt;145) was associated with over an eight-fold increased odds of ICU admission or death (OR=8.57, p&lt;0.001). An isolated elevated BNP with CVD did not increase the risk of primary events.Conclusion: Among COVID-19 patients with underlying CVD, the presence of an elevated TN or hypernatremia was associated with significantly increased odds of ICU admission or death. Elevated BNP with CVD did not increase risk of events. Identifying these factors on presentation may prove helpful for early triage of high-risk patients.","Roman, A.; Darwish, C.; Smith, S.; Zhang, S.; Dharia, I.; Houle, M.; Gomberg-Maitland, M.; Krepp, J.",American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,425,1

The majority of governments and national health authorities have set the 2-meter physical distancing as a mandatory safety measure in shopping centres, schools and other covered areas. In this research, we develop a generic Deep Neural Network-Based model for automated people detection, tracking, and inter-people distances estimation in the crowd, using common CCTV security cameras. The proposed model includes a YOLOv4-based framework and inverse perspective mapping for accurate people detection and social distancing monitoring in challenging conditions, including people occlusion, partial visibility, and lighting variations. We also provide an online risk assessment scheme by statistical analysis of the Spatio-temporal data from the moving trajectories and the rate of social distancing violations. We identify high-risk zones with the highest possibility of virus spread and infections. This may help authorities to redesign the layout of a public place or to take precaution actions to mitigate high-risk zones. The efficiency of the proposed methodology is evaluated on the Oxford Town Centre dataset, with superior performance in terms of accuracy and speed compared to three state-of-the-art methods.","Rezaei, Mahdi; Azarmi, Mohsen",,425,24

DESIGN: Cross-sectional descriptive study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Queen Elizabeth Hospital, 20 April 2020-13 May 2020. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred and seven (n=107) patients of PCR-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham, between 20 April 2020 and 13 May 2020 were included in the study using consecutive sampling. Data were collected using the Excel audit tool and included age, gender, weight, estimated eGFR, D-dimer values on admission, intensive care unit admission, presence of respiratory failure, imaging results for evaluation of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and anticoagulation received on admission. The data were entered in the SPSS (V.17) and were analysed. Data were summarised as means±SD, number or percentage as appropriate. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: The frequency of VTE was found to be 11.2% in patients hospitalised with COVID-19 pneumonia. The mean D-dimers were 3322.24 ng/mL±9603 ng/mL with the values significantly higher for patients with VTE and those requiring intensive care unit admission. All of the seven patients (100%) with D-dimers value above 2000 ng/mL who underwent imaging were found to have VTE. CONCLUSION: VTE is frequent in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia despite anticoagulation. A higher D-dimers value correlates well with the risk of VTE in these patients and further evaluation of such patients for VTE is necessary especially with D-dimers values above 2000 ng/mL.","Khan, Muhammad Ziaullah; Jamal, Yousaf; Sutton, Benjamin; Rauf, Farrukh",,425,33

The average age at the first operation was 24 months. The average follow-up time was 46 months. All patients achieved reasonable hand function and were able to use the reconstructed thumb to grip small and large objects. The operated thumb achieved an average Kapandji score of 6.7 and average pinch strength of 0.9 kg. There were two cases of graft nonunion. All parents are satisfied with the function and appearance of the reconstructed thumb and donor foot. We conclude that non-vascularized fourth metatarsal transfer is a feasible reconstruction method for patients with Types IIIB and IV hypoplastic thumbs. The reconstruction allows for the preservation of a 5-digit hand with reasonable function and appearance and minimal donor site morbidity, although long-term growth of the metatarsals still need to be monitored.Level of evidence: IV.","Liu, Bo; Chen, Shanlin; Chow, Esther Ching San; Li, Pengcheng; Liu, Kun; Yang, Chen",J Hand Surg Eur Vol,425,1

In the treatment of high flow priapism, super-selective embolization is considered treatment of choice when conservative treatment fails as reported in the ""EAU Guidelines on Priapism"", but there are only few series reporting the outcome, the efficacy of different embolic materials and these studies are uncontrolled and relatively small. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to review the literature to outline the state of the art of this interventional treatment and to analyse the outcome of the different embolic agents. METHODS: Through Medline database we searched all the English-language published articles related to priapism. Keywords were chosen according to MeSH terms. We selected case-series from 1990 to 2020 including at least five cases of high-flow priapism.The variables extracted from the selected articles were: number of patients, mean age, diagnostic imaging modality, mono or bilateral involvement of the arteries, embolization material, technical success, clinical success, complications, recurrence rate and type of reintervention, mean follow up, onset of erectile dysfunction. RESULTS: We analyzed 11 papers.A total of 117 patients, mean age of 30 years, were studied during a period of 8 to 72 months. Technical success average was 99%, varying from 93 to 100%. Clinical success average was 88%, varying from 56 to 100%. After two or more treatments, resolution of priapism was obtained in all patients. No major adverse events registered. Recurrence rate of 21%(25/117) was observed, and only 4 pts underwent surgery. A total of 17 pts (15%) developed erectile dysfunction (ED). CONCLUSION: Our data suggested comparable outcomes using different types of materials.In line with the last evidences we suggest that the choice of the embolic material should be selected basing on the expertise of the operator, the characteristic of the fistula and characteristic of the patients.","Arrichiello, Antonio; Angileri, Salvatore Alessio; Buccimazza, Giorgio; Di Bartolomeo, Francesco; Di Meglio, Letizia; Liguori, Alessandro; Gurgitano, Martina; Ierardi, Anna Maria; Papa, Maurizio; Paolucci, Aldo; Carrafiello, Gianpaolo",Acta Biomed,425,16

METHODS: Patients were enrolled at the emergency department (ED) and outpatient testing centers. Each patient was given a home pulse oximeter and instructed to record their SpO2 every 8 hours. Patients were instructed to return to the ED for sustained home SpO2 < 92% or if they felt they needed emergent medical attention. Relative risk was used to assess the relation between hospitalization and home SpO2 < 92% in COVID-19-positive patients. RESULTS: We enrolled 209 patients with suspected COVID-19, of whom 77 patients tested positive for COVID-19 and were included. Subsequent hospitalization occurred in 22 of 77 (29%) patients. Resting home SpO2 < 92% was associated with an increased likelihood of hospitalization compared to SpO2 &#8805; 92% (relative risk = 7.0, 95% confidence interval = 3.4 to 14.5, p < 0.0001). Home SpO2 < 92% was also associated with increased risk of intensive care unit admission, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and septic shock. In our cohort, 50% of patients who ended up hospitalized only returned to the ED for incidental finding of low home SpO2 without worsening of symptoms. One-third (33%) of nonhospitalized patients stated that they would have returned to the ED if they did not have a pulse oximeter to reassure them at home. CONCLUSIONS: This study found that home pulse oximetry monitoring identifies need for hospitalization in initially nonsevere COVID-19 patients when a cutoff of SpO2 92% is used. Half of patients who ended up hospitalized had SpO2 < 92% without worsening symptoms. Home SpO2 monitoring also reduces unnecessary ED revisits.","Shah, Sonia; Majmudar, Kaushal; Stein, Amy; Gupta, Nita; Suppes, Spencer; Karamanis, Marina; Capannari, Joseph; Sethi, Sanjay; Patte, Christine",Acad. emerg. med,425,16

They remain, however, impacted by far-reaching public health interventions. One crucial question often posed is whether children generally transmit SARS-CoV-2 effectively. METHODS: We assessed the components of transmission and the different study designs and considerations necessary for valid assessment of transmission dynamics. We searched for published evidence about transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by children employing a narrative review methodology through 25 June, 2020. RESULTS: Transmission dynamics must be studied in repre - sentative pediatric populations with a combination of study designs including rigorous epidemiological studies (e.g. in households, schools, daycares, clinical settings) and laboratory studies while taking into account the social and socio-economic contexts. Viral load (VL) estimates from representative pediatric samples of infected children are missing so far. Currently available evidence suggests that the secondary attack rate stratified by age of the infector is lower for children, however this age pattern needs to be better quantified and understood. CONCLUSION: A generalizable pediatric evidence base is urgently needed to inform policy making now, later when facing potential subsequent waves, and extending through a future in which endemicity alongside vaccination may become the enduring reality.","Merckx, Joanna; Labrecque, Jeremy A; Kaufman, Jay S",Dtsch Arztebl Int,425,16

However, the prevalence of repositivity by real-time PCR for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) remains unclear. Methods: A retrospective study was conducted involving 599 discharged patients with COVID-19 in a single medical centre. The clinical features of patients during their hospitalization and 14-day post-discharge quarantine were collected. Results: A total of 122 patients (20.4%) out of 599 patients retested positive after discharge. Specifically, 94 (15.7%) retested positive within 24 h of discharge, and another 28 patients (4.7%) were repositive on day 7 after discharge, although none showed any clinical symptomatic recurrence. Both repositives and non­repositives have similar patterns of IgG and IgM. Notably, the length of hospitalization of non-repositive patients was longer than that of 24-h repositive patients and 7-day repositive patients. In addition, the length of hospitalization of 24-h repositive patients was shorter than that of 7-day repositive patients, indicating that the length of hospitalization was also a determinant of viral shedding. Conclusion: Our study provides further information for improving the management of recovered and discharged patients, and further studies should be performed to elucidate the infectiveness of individuals with prolonged or RNA repositivity.","Huang, Kun; Liu, Wen; Zhou, Jinxia; Wang, Yao; Zhang, Yuxiang; Tang, Xinle; Liang, Jing; Bi, Fang-Fang",Int J Med Sci,425,20

DESIGN: Multicenter retrospective cohort study SETTING:: One Level 1 Trauma Center and one orthopaedic specialty hospital in New York CityPatients/Participants: Fifty-nine consecutive patients (average age 85, range: 65 - 100 years) treated for a hip fracture (OTA/AO 31, 32.1) over a 5-week period, March 20, 2020 to April 24, 2020, during the height of the COVID-19 crisis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: COVID-19 infection status was used to stratify patients. The primary outcome was inpatient mortality. Secondary outcomes were admission to the intensive care unit, unexpected intubation, pneumonia, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolus, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, urinary tract infection, and transfusion. Baseline demographics, comorbidities, treatment characteristics, and COVID-related symptomatology were also evaluated. RESULTS: Ten patients (15%) tested positive for COVID-19 (COVID+) (n=9; 7 preoperatively, 2 postoperatively) or were presumed positive (n=1), 40 (68%) patients tested negative, and 9 (15%) patients were not tested in the primary hospitalization. American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) scores were higher in the COVID+ group (d=-0.83; p=0.04); however, the Charlson Comorbidity Index was similar between the study groups (d=-0.17; p=0.63). Inpatient mortality was significantly increased in the COVID+ cohort (56% vs. 4%; OR 30.0, 95% CI 4.3-207; p=0.001).

Suppressing the activity of telomerase, a telomere-synthesizing enzyme, and maintaining short telomeres is a protective mechanism against cancer in humans. In most human somatic cells, the expression of telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) is repressed and telomerase activity is inhibited. This leads to the progressive shortening of telomeres and inhibition of cell growth in a process called replicative senescence. Most types of primary cancer exhibit telomerase activation, which allows uncontrolled cell proliferation. Previous research indicates that TERT activation also affects cancer development through activities other than the canonical function of mediating telomere elongation. Recent studies have improved the understanding of the structure and function of telomeres and telomerase as well as key mechanisms underlying the activation of TERT and its role in oncogenesis. These advances led to a search for drugs that inhibit telomerase as a target for cancer therapy. The present review article summarizes the organization and function of telomeres, their role in carcinogenesis, and advances in telomerase-targeted therapy.","Trybek, Tomasz; Kowalik, Artur; Gózdz, Stanislaw; Kowalska, Aldona",Oncol Lett,425,20

Furthermore, under stay-at-home orders and with bricks-and-mortar retailers closed, consumers were also forced to adapt. Thus the pandemic offers a unique opportunity to study shifts in behaviour during disruption to industrialised manufacturing and economic contraction, in order to understand the role peer-to-peer production may play in a transition to long-term sustainability of production and consumption, or degrowth. Here, we analyse publicly-available datasets on internet search traffic and corporation financial returns to track the shifts in public interest and consumer behaviour over 2019 – 2020. We find a jump in interest in home-making and small-scale production at the beginning of the pandemic, as well as a substantial and sustained shift in consumer preference for peer-to-peer e-commerce platforms relative to more-established online vendors. In particular we present two case studies – the home-made facemasks supplied through Etsy, and the decentralised efforts of the 3D printer community – to assess the effectiveness of their responses to the pandemic. These patterns of behaviour are related to new modes of production in line with ecological economics and as such add capacity to a broader prefiguration of degrowth. We suggest an adoption of a new “fourth wave” of DIY culture defined by enhanced resilience and degrowth to continue to add capacity to a prefigurative politic of degrowth.","Dartnell, Lewis R.; Kish, Kaitlin",Sustainable Production and Consumption,425,26

School closure, one of the critical changes during the first COVID-19 wave, caused decreases in social contacts and increases in family time for children and adolescents. This can have both positive and negative influences on suicide, which is one of the robust mental health outcomes. However, the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on children and adolescents in terms of suicide is unknown. OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the acute effect of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic on suicide among children and adolescents during school closure in Japan. DATA: Total number of suicides per month among children and adolescents under 20 years old between January 2018 and May 2020. METHODS: Poisson regression was used to examine whether suicide increased or decreased during school closure, which spanned from March to May 2020, compared with the same period in 2018 and 2019. Robustness check was conducted using all data from January 2018 to May 2020. Negative binomial regression, a model with overdispersion, was also performed. RESULTS: We found no significant change in suicide rates during the school closure (incidence rate ratio (IRR) = 1.15, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.81 to 1.64). We found the main effect of month, that is, suicides significantly increased suicides in May (IRR: 1.34, 95% CI: 1.01 to 1.78) compared to March, but the interaction terms of month and school closure were not significant (p > 0.1). CONCLUSIONS: As preliminary findings, this study suggests that the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic has not significantly affected suicide rates among children and adolescents during the school closure in Japan.","Isumi, Aya; Doi, Satomi; Yamaoka, Yui; Takahashi, Kunihiko; Fujiwara, Takeo",Child Abuse Negl,425,6

All cases with suspected MIS-C were reported to the French National Public Health Agency. Confirmed MIS-C cases fulfilling the World Health Organization definition were included. The study started on April 1, 2020, and follow-up ended on January 6, 2021. Exposures: IVIG and methylprednisolone vs IVIG alone. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was persistence of fever 2 days after the introduction of initial therapy or recrudescence of fever within 7 days, which defined treatment failure. Secondary outcomes included a second-line therapy, hemodynamic support, acute left ventricular dysfunction after first-line therapy, and length of stay in the pediatric intensive care unit. The primary analysis involved propensity score matching with a minimum caliper of 0.1. Results: Among 181 children with suspected MIS-C, 111 fulfilled the World Health Organization definition (58 females [52%]; median age, 8.6 years [interquartile range, 4.7 to 12.1]). Five children did not receive either treatment. Overall, 3 of 34 children (9%) in the IVIG and methylprednisolone group and 37 of 72 (51%) in the IVIG alone group did not respond to treatment. Treatment with IVIG and methylprednisolone vs IVIG alone was associated with lower risk of treatment failure (absolute risk difference, -0.28 [95% CI, -0.48 to -0.08]; odds ratio [OR], 0.25 [95% CI, 0.09 to 0.70]; P = .008). IVIG and methylprednisolone therapy vs IVIG alone was also significantly associated with lower risk of use of second-line therapy (absolute risk difference, -0.22 [95% CI, -0.40 to -0.04]; OR, 0.19 [95% CI, 0.06 to 0.61]; P = .004), hemodynamic support (absolute risk difference, -0.17 [95% CI, -0.34 to -0.004]; OR, 0.21 [95% CI, 0.06 to 0.76]), acute left ventricular dysfunction occurring after initial therapy (absolute risk difference, -0.18 [95% CI, -0.35 to -0.01]; OR, 0.20 [95% CI, 0.06 to 0.66]), and duration of stay in the pediatric intensive care unit (median, 4 vs 6 days; difference in days, -2.4 [95% CI, -4.0 to -0.7]). Conclusions and Relevance: Among children with MIS-C, treatment with IVIG and methylprednisolone vs IVIG alone was associated with a more favorable fever course. Study interpretation is limited by the observational design.","Ouldali, Naïm; Toubiana, Julie; Antona, Denise; Javouhey, Etienne; Madhi, Fouad; Lorrot, Mathie; Léger, Pierre-Louis; Galeotti, Caroline; Claude, Caroline; Wiedemann, Arnaud; Lachaume, Noémie; Ovaert, Caroline; Dumortier, Morgane; Kahn, Jean-Emmanuel; Mandelcwajg, Alexis; Percheron, Lucas; Biot, Blandine; Bordet, Jeanne; Girardin, Marie-Laure; Yang, David Dawei; Grimaud, Marion; Oualha, Mehdi; Allali, Slimane; Bajolle, Fanny; Beyler, Constance; Meinzer, Ulrich; Levy, Michael; Paulet, Ana-Maria; Levy, Corinne; Cohen, Robert; Belot, Alexandre; Angoulvant, François",JAMA,425,20

A self-reported questionnaire was provided to ascertain the frequency of various lifestyle activities before and after the coronavirus disease 2019 containment measures in Japan. Among 463 patients, change in glycated hemoglobin was significantly associated with change in bodyweight. After stratification by age 65 years, binary logistic regression analysis showed that increased frequency of snack eating increased bodyweight (odds ratio 1.709, P = 0.007) and glycated hemoglobin (odds ratio 1.420, P = 0.025) in the younger group, whereas in the older patients, reduced walking activities resulted in weight gain (odds ratio 0.726, P = 0.010). In conclusion, changes in eating behavior and physical activity increased bodyweight and reduced glycemic control among diabetes patients, but by different processes depending on age under the coronavirus disease 2019 containment measures in Japan.","Tanaka, Nagaaki; Hamamoto, Yoshiyuki; Kurotobi, Yuri; Yamasaki, Yuji; Nakatani, Susumu; Matsubara, Miho; Haraguchi, Takuya; Yamaguchi, Yuko; Izumi, Kiyohiro; Fujita, Yuki; Kuwata, Hitoshi; Hyo, Takanori; Yamada, Yuichiro; Kurose, Takeshi; Seino, Yutaka",J. diabetes investig.

The Howard Brown Health organization has rapidly expanded to include COVID-19 testing, contact tracing, and linkage to resources since the first cases were identified in Chicago, Illinois. COVID-19 is penetrating the most vulnerable networks in the United States; existing inequities are widening as community resources and organizations have had to place services on hold.Here we address several questions that arise as organizations build capacity for contact tracing, including questions involving the potential impact of contact tracing, stakeholders who could be involved, the timing of contact tracing deployment, and the impact potential for digital technology.Contact tracing is critical at later stages of epidemic decline given the potential for isolated outbreaks as larger events, schools, stadiums, and festivals reopen. Local contact tracing efforts can have other indirect benefits with respect to limiting transmission, such as increasing testing rates and addressing structural barriers through provision of life-saving resources and access to crucial social support.","Schneider, John; Love, Willie; Rusie, Laura; Flores, Ariana; Tadesse, Beth; Hazra, Anu; Munar, David",Am J Public Health,425,16

A long-term culture of hybridomas will inevitably induce a heterogenization of the whole hybridoma population, resulting in a continuous growth of non-producing hybridomas. To overcome the limits of existing methods of screening heterogeneous hybridomas, in which the whole multi-round screening process is performed in multi-well plates or other discrete modules, this study presents a novel method in which all processing steps of a multi-round hybridoma screening are finished in a single microfluidic chip. This microfluidic chip comprehensively performs hybridoma trapping/proliferating/transferring and fluorescent identification of protein-antibody binding at single cell level. By performing a two-round screening of anti-CD45 mAb secreting hybridomas, the novel microfluidic chip was proved capable of screening several single high-producing hybridomas with minimum cell loss/human labor/time cost, and more importantly, enhanced accuracy and definite monoclonality, which is one of the most important properties of mAb production.","Zhang, Weikai; Li, Ren; Jia, Fei; Hu, Zhiyuan; Li, Qin; Wei, Zewen",Lab Chip,425,32

By increasing the amount of globally accessible real-time information, today's ubiquitous producers contribute to a world, where an individual consumes vanishingly smaller fractions of all produced content. In general, consumers preferentially select information that closely matches their individual views and values. The bias inherent in such selection is further magnified by today's information curation services that maximize user engagement (and thus service revenue) by filtering new content in accordance with observed consumer preferences. Consequently, individuals get exposed to increasingly narrower bands of the ideology spectrum. Societies get fragmented into increasingly ideologically isolated enclaves. These enclaves (or echo-chambers) then become vulnerable to misinformation spread, which in turn further magnifies polarization and bias. We call this dynamic the paradox of information access; a growing ideological fragmentation in the age of sharing. This article describes the technical, economic, and socio-cognitive contributors to this paradox, and explores research directions towards its mitigation.","Abdelzaher, Tarek; Ji, Heng; Li, Jinyang; Yang, Chaoqi; Dellaverson, John; Zhang, Lixia; Xu, Chao; Szymanski, Boleslaw K.",,425,2

AREAS COVERED: This collaborative work proposes practical management and follow-up criteria for uveitis patients in the context of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. EXPERT OPINION: Management should proceed as usual when access to health care possible in patients who do not belong to a group at high risk of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, and in uncontrolled uveitis cases. In case of reduced access to eye clinics or high risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, patients' management should be stratified based on their clinical presentation. In non-severe uveitis cases, the use of systemic steroids should be avoided, and local steroids preferred whenever possible. In uncontrolled situations where there is real risk of permanent visual loss, high-dose intravenous steroids and/or systemic immunosuppressants and/or biotherapies can be administered depending on the severity of eye disease. Immunosuppressive therapy should not be withheld, unless the patient develops SARS-CoV2 infection.","Stanescu-Segall, Dinu; Sales de Gauzy, Thomas; Reynolds, Rhianon; Faes, Livia; Pohlmann, Dominika; Pakzad-Vaezi, Kaivon; Ting, Daniel; Saadoun, David; Ambati, Jayakrishna; Loewenstein, Anat; Bodaghi, Bahram; de Smet, Marc D; Touhami, Sara",Expert Rev Clin Immunol,425,23

However, several reports have been published of patients with ischemic strokes in the setting of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The mechanisms of how SARS-CoV-2 results in blood clots and large vessel strokes need to be defined as it has therapeutic implications. SARS-CoV-2 enters the blood stream by breaching the blood-air barrier via the lung capillary adjacent to the alveolus, and then attaches to the angiotensin-converting enzyme II receptors on the endothelial cells. Once SARS-CoV-2 enters the blood stream, a cascade of events (Steps 1-8) unfolds including accumulation of angiotensin II, reactive oxygen species, endothelial dysfunction, oxidation of beta 2 glycoprotein 1, formation of antiphospholipid antibody complexes promoting platelet aggregation, coagulation cascade, and formation of cross-linked fibrin blood clots, leading to pulmonary emboli (PE) and large vessel strokes seen on angiographic imaging studies. There is emerging evidence for COVID-19 being a blood clotting disorder and SARS-CoV-2 using the respiratory route to enter the blood stream. As the blood-air barrier is breached, varying degrees of collateral damage occur. Although antiviral and immune therapies are studied, the role of blood thinners in the prevention, and management of blood clots in Covid-19 need evaluation. In addition to ventilators and blood thinners, continuous aspiration and clot retrieval devices (approved in Europe, cleared in the United States) or cyclical aspiration devices (approved in Europe) need to be considered for the emergent management of life-threatening clots including PE and large vessel strokes.","Janardhan, Vallabh; Janardhan, Vikram; Kalousek, Vladimir",J Neuroimaging,425,20

It is now known to have many extrapulmonary affections including gastrointestinal symptoms associated with high mortality rates. An unusual presentation of bowel perforation in a patient who had recently undergone cesarean delivery prompted us to report this mini review of bowel perforations attributed to coronavirus. Case: Our patient, a 19-year-old primigravida, underwent an emergency cesarean section under spinal anesthesia. Intraoperative events and postoperative period were uneventful, and the patient was discharged on postoperative day 5. On the 10th postoperative day, the patient presented in septic shock to the emergency department with complaints of acute epigastric pain, vomiting, loose stools, and bilious discharge from the wound site. Oral contrast computed tomography was done, which revealed a proximal jejunal perforation. The patient was taken up for laparotomy followed by bowel repair with placement of intraperitoneal drains. Immediate postoperatively, the patient developed high-grade fever for which reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)_ for COVID-19 was sent. The result for the same turned out to be positive. Twenty-four hours after the laparotomy, the intraperitoneal drains again started draining copious bilious discharge along with the deterioration of general condition of the patient. She expired on the third postoperative day. This was followed by a thorough research of the literature into possible etiologies for bowel perforation. In this mini review, we shall be discussing various case reports to determine the cause of such unusual presentation in our patient. © Jaypee Brothers Medical Publishers.","Ramani, M. V.; Saxena, R.

Consequently, SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays with high specificity and positive predictive values are needed to obtain an accurate epidemiological picture. As more data accumulate about the immune responses and the kinetics of neutralizing antibody (nAb) production in SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals, new applications are forecasted for serological assays such as nAb activity prediction in convalescent plasma from recovered patients. This multicenter study, involving six hospital centres, determined the baseline clinical performances, reproducibility and nAb level correlations of ten commercially available immunoassays. In addition, three lateral flow chromatography assays were evaluated as these devices can be used in logistically challenged area. All assays were evaluated using the same patient panels in duplicate thus enabling accurate comparison of the tests. Seven immunoassays examined in this study were shown to have excellent specificity (98 to 100%) and good to excellent positive predictive values (82 to 100%) when used in a low (5%) seroprevalence setting. We observed sensitivity values as low as 74% and as high as 95% at &#8805;15 days post symptom onset. The determination of optimized cut-off values through ROC curves analyses had a significant impact on the diagnostic resolution of several enzyme immunoassays by increasing the sensitivity significantly without a large trade-off in specificity. We found that Spike-based immunoassays seems to be better correlates of nAb activity. Finally, the results reported here will add up to the general knowledge of the inter-laboratory reproducibility of clinical performance parameters of immunoassays and provide new evidence about nAb activity prediction.","Therrien, C; Serhir, B; Bélanger-Collard, M; Skrzypczak, J; Shank, D K; Renaud, C; Girouard, J; Loungnarath, V; Carrier, M; Brochu, G; Tourangeau, F; Gilfix, B; Piche, A; Bazin, R; Guérin, R; Lavoie, M; Martel-Laferrière, V; Fortin, C; Benoit, A; Marcoux, D; Gauthier, N; Laumaea, A M; Gasser, R; Finzi, A; Roger, M",J. clin. microbiol,425,16
433554,433554,433554,COVID-19: Understanding Testing,19.075722,3.938662,2020,"Starting from late 2019, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has emerged as a once-in-a-century pandemic with deadly consequences, which urgently calls for new treatments, cures, and supporting apparatuses. Recently, because of its positive results in clinical trials, remdesivir was approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat COVID-19 through Emergency Use Authorization. Here, we used molecular dynamics simulations and free energy perturbation methods to study the inhibition mechanism of remdesivir to its target SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). We first constructed the homology model of this polymerase based on a previously available structure of SARS-CoV NSP12 RdRp (with a sequence identity of 95.8%). We then built a putative preinsertion binding structure by aligning the remdesivir + RdRp complex to the ATP bound poliovirus RdRp without the RNA template. The putative binding structure was further optimized with molecular dynamics simulations. The resulting stable preinsertion state of remdesivir appeared to form hydrogen bonds with the RNA template when aligned with the newly solved cryo-EM structure of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. The relative binding free energy between remdesivir and ATP was calculated to be -2.80 ± 0.84 kcal/mol, where remdesivir bound much stronger to SARS-CoV-2 RdRp than the natural substrate ATP. The â¼100-fold improvement in the Kd from remdesivir over ATP indicates an effective replacement of ATP in blocking of the RdRp preinsertion site. Key residues D618, S549, and R555 are found to be the contributors to the binding affinity of remdesivir. These findings suggest that remdesivir can potentially act as a SARS-CoV-2 RNA-chain terminator, effectively stopping its RNA replication, with key residues also identified for future lead optimization and/or drug resistance studies.","Zhang, Leili; Zhou, Ruhong",J Phys Chem B,425,17

While little is known about how face masks affect the therapeutic experience of patients and therapists, the effectiveness of telepsychiatry is well documented for several psychiatric disorders. However, research on the benefits of telepsychiatry in adult patients with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) remains scarce. This seems problematic since the symptoms typically associated with ADHD, such as attention problems and distractibility, may lessen the utility of telepsychiatry for this particular group. The present study's aim was to explore how adult patients with ADHD and their therapists experienced therapy sessions during the COVID-19 pandemic in three different settings: face-to-face with the therapist wearing a face mask, via telephone, or via videoconferencing. METHODS: In this exploratory, quantitatively driven mixed-method study (quantitative questionnaire data and qualitative data from open-ended responses), we assessed patients' evaluation of the session, their treatment satisfaction, and patients' and therapists' ratings of therapeutic alliance. We also collected qualitative comments on both sides' experience of the session. Overall, 97 therapist and 66 patient questionnaires were completed. Results are reported for the N = 60 cases for which data from both parties were available. Sequential multiple regressions adjusted for therapist and number of sessions were used for the main quantitative analyses. RESULTS: No statistically significant differences regarding session flow, post-session positivity, satisfaction and therapeutic alliance were observed. The only exception was that telepsychiatric sessions were rated as significantly less deep than face-to-face sessions, an effect that may decline over time, especially in the videoconferencing group. Patients and therapists identified similar facilitating and complicating aspects, but differed in their emphasis of specific elements. CONCLUSIONS: Both settings, on-site with the therapist wearing a face mask and telepsychiatric, seem to be valid options to continue treatment of adults with ADHD during a situation such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Aspects such as patient preference, session content, and therapeutic methods may be useful to identify the most suitable modality.","Wyler, Helen; Liebrenz, Michael; Ajdacic-Gross, Vladeta; Seifritz, Erich; Young, Susan; Burger, Pascal; Buadze, Anna",BMC Psychiatry,425,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The 3-month prospective analytical interventional study sampled 85 undergraduate students from the Department of Preventive Dental Sciences. A WhatsApp group was created, information was sent to the male and female groups, and a written assignment was used as a performance benchmark of knowledge acquisition and application. Perceptions of e-learning through WhatsApp were assessed using a previously validated and published questionnaire. Collected data underwent descriptive and bivariate analyses (unpaired t-test). RESULTS: The average assignment scores of the 85 hybrid learners were statistically significantly higher than those of traditional learners from the previous academic year (34 +/- 1 vs 26 +/- 3;p &lt; 0.05, respectively). Meanwhile, 57 hybrid learners completed the survey, and 73% agreed/strongly agreed that introducing a new method of teaching via WhatsApp was useful, 70% reported that a professional and comfortable learning environment was created, and 70% felt that group distractions were handled appropriately. The top advantages of learning through WhatsApp were availability/immediacy (94.7%) and being simple to operate (91.2%). Males (40.4%) were significantly more likely to report a sense of belonging to the group than females (33.3%, p = 0.01). Respondents agreed that high expectations of teacher availability (71.9%) and some students making no effort (52.6%) were challenges. Message flooding (45.6%) and time-consuming nature of WhatsApp (36.8%) were identified as technical challenges. CONCLUSION: The findings showed significant improvements in student performance using the hybrid learning tool, as reflected in assignment scores. Positive perceptions of hybrid learning and improved academic performance indicate that WhatsApp is a convenient new teaching tool. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The results of this study may be applicable to other clinical dental disciplines.","Alsharif, A. T.; Alsharif, B.; Alsharif, L.; Althagafi, N.; Natto, Z.

In this paper we investigate whether the recent development of language models sensitive to the semantics and context of words, such as Google's BERT, may be useful to overcome this adversarial attack (called""Mad-lib""as per the word substitution game). Using a dataset of 5572 SMS spam messages, we first established a baseline of detection performance using widely known document representation models (BoW and TFIDF) and the novel BERT model, coupled with a variety of classification algorithms (Decision Tree, kNN, SVM, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Multilayer Perceptron). Then, we built a thesaurus of the vocabulary contained in these messages, and set up a Mad-lib attack experiment in which we modified each message of a held out subset of data (not used in the baseline experiment) with different rates of substitution of original words with synonyms from the thesaurus. Lastly, we evaluated the detection performance of the three representation models (BoW, TFIDF and BERT) coupled with the best classifier from the baseline experiment (SVM). We found that the classic models achieved a 94% Balanced Accuracy (BA) in the original dataset, whereas the BERT model obtained 96%. On the other hand, the Mad-lib attack experiment showed that BERT encodings manage to maintain a similar BA performance of 96% with an average substitution rate of 1.82 words per message, and 95% with 3.34 words substituted per message. In contrast, the BA performance of the BoW and TFIDF encoders dropped to chance. These results hint at the potential advantage of BERT models to combat these type of ingenious attacks, offsetting to some extent for the inappropriate use of semantic relationships in language.","Rojas-Galeano, Sergio",,425,16

The challenges of immigration of new infections into regions and asymptomatic infections remain. Standard deterministic compartmental models are inappropriate for sub- or peri-critical epidemics (reproductive number close to or less than one), so individual-based models are often used by simulating transmission from an infected person to others. However, to be realistic, these models require a large number of parameters, each with its own set of uncertainties and lack of analytic tractability. Here, we apply stochastic age-structured Leslie theory with a long history in ecological research to provide some new insights to epidemic dynamics fuelled by external imports. We model the dynamics of an epidemic when R (0) is below one, representing COVID-19 transmission following the successful application of intervention measures, and the transmission dynamics expected when infections migrate into a region. The model framework allows more rapid prediction of the shape and size of an epidemic to improve scaling of the response. During an epidemic when the numbers of infected individuals are rapidly changing, this will help clarify the situation of the pandemic and guide faster and more effective intervention.","Engen, S.; Tian, H.; Yang, R.; Bjørnstad, O.

Medical schools around the United States faced difficult decisions, temporarily suspending hospital-based clerkship rotations for medical students due to potential shortages of personal protective equipment and a need to social distance. This decision created a need for innovative, virtual learning opportunities to support undergraduate medical education. APPROACH: Educators at Yale School of Medicine developed a novel medical student curriculum converting high-fidelity, mannequin-based simulation into a fully online virtual telesimulation format. By using a virtual videoconferencing platform to deliver remote telesimulation as an immersive educational experience for widely dispersed students, this novel technology retains the experiential strengths of simulation-based learning while complying with needs for social distancing during the pandemic. The curriculum comprises simulated clinical scenarios that include live patient actors, facilitator interactions, and real-time assessment of vital signs, labs, and imaging. Each 90-minute session includes two sets of simulation scenarios and faculty-led teledebriefs. A team of three students performs the first scenario while an additional team of three students observes. Teams reverse roles for the second scenario. OUTCOMES: The six-week virtual telesimulation elective enrolled the maximum 48 medical students and covered core clinical clerkship content areas. Communication patterns within the virtual telesimulation format require more deliberate turn-taking than normal conversation. Using the chat function within the video-conferencing platform allowed teams to complete simultaneous tasks. A nurse confederate provided cues not available in the virtual telesimulation format. NEXT STEPS: Rapid dissemination of this program, including online webinars and live demonstration sessions with student volunteers, support the development of similar programs at other universities. Evaluation and process improvement efforts include planned qualitative evaluation of this new format to further understand and refine the learning experience. Future work is needed to evaluate clinical skill development in this educational modality.","Ray, Jessica M; Wong, Ambrose H; Yang, Thomas J; Buck, Samuel; Joseph, Melissa; Bonz, James W; Auerbach, Marc A; Couturier, Katherine; Tomassoni, Anthony J; Schwartz, Michael L; Evans, Leigh V",Acad. med,425,26

OBJECTIVES: We evaluate the experience of ED clinicians with embedded PC in the ED during the coronavirus disease pandemic. METHODS: ED clinicians completed a survey about their perceptions of embedded PC in the ED. We summarized responses to closed-ended items using descriptive statistics and analyzed open-ended items using thematic analysis. RESULTS: There were 134 ED clinicians surveyed. About 101 replied (75% response rate). Of those who had interacted with PC, 100% indicated a benefit of having PC involved. These included freeing up ED clinicians for other tasks (89%), helping them feel more supported (84%), changing the patients care trajectory (67%), and contributing to clinician education (57%) and skills (49%). Among barriers related to engaging PC were difficulty locating them (8%) and lack of time to consult because of ED volume (5%). About 98% of respondents felt that having PC in the ED was either valuable or very valuable. Open-ended responses reflected a positive impact on clinician wellness and improvement in access to high-quality goal-concordant care. Clinicians expressed gratitude for having PC in the ED and noted the importance of having readily available and easily accessible PC in the ED.

DesignThe Contact Adherence Behavioural Insights Study (CABINS) was a 15-minute telephone survey of confirmed contacts of cases of COVID-19 identified through the national NHS Wales Test Trace Protect (TTP) database. MethodsConfirmed contacts of cases of COVID-19 reached by TTP completed a 15-minute telephone survey (N = 2,027). Binary logistic regression models adjusted for age, gender, living alone, survey round, deprivation quintile (defined by the Welsh Index of Multiple Deprivation) and income precarity (financial security) determined which population sub-groups were more likely to experience challenges during self-isolation. ResultsYounger people (aged 18-29 years) were 3 times more likely to report mental health concerns (Adjusted Odds Ratio [aOR]: 3.16, 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 2.05-4.86) and 2 times more likely to report loneliness (aOR: 1.96, CI: 1.37-2.81) compared to people aged over 60 years. Women were 1.5 times more likely to experience mental health concerns (aOR: 1.51, 95% CI: 1.20-1.92) compared to men.

Persistent clinical symptoms following resolution of initial infection, termed long COVID, are also hugely variable, but association with immunological changes has not been described. We investigate changing immunological parameters in convalescent COVID-19 and interrogate their potential relationships with persistent symptoms. Methods: We performed paired immunophenotyping at initial SARS-CoV-2 infection and convalescence (n=40, median 68 days) and validated findings in 71 further patients at median 101 days convalescence. Results were compared to 40 pre-pandemic controls. Fatigue and exercise tolerance were assessed as cardinal features of long COVID using the Chalder Fatigue Scale and 6-minute-walk test. The relationships between these clinical outcomes and convalescent immunological results were investigated. Results: We identify persistent expansion of intermediate monocytes, effector CD8+, activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and reduced naïve CD4+ and CD8+ T cells at 68 days, with activated CD8+ T cells remaining increased at 101 days. Patients >60 years also demonstrate reduced naïve CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and expanded activated CD4+ T cells at 101 days. Ill-health, fatigue, and reduced exercise tolerance were common in this cohort. These symptoms were not associated with immune cell populations or circulating inflammatory cytokines. Conclusion: We demonstrate myeloid recovery but persistent T cell abnormalities in convalescent COVID-19 patients more than three months after initial infection. These changes are more marked with age and are independent of ongoing subjective ill-health, fatigue and reduced exercise tolerance.","Townsend, Liam; Dyer, Adam H; Naughton, Aifric; Kiersey, Rachel; Holden, Dean; Gardiner, Mary; Dowds, Joanne; O039,; Brien, Kate; Bannan, Ciaran; Nadarajan, Parthiban; Dunne, Jean; Martin-Loeches, Ignacio; Fallon, Padraic G; Bergin, Colm; Farrelly, Cliona; Cheallaigh, Cliona Ni; Bourke, Nollaig M; Conlon, Niall",Front Immunol,425,29

We assessed the relation between assets, financial stressors and probable depression during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Between 31 March 2020 and 13 April 2020, we surveyed a probability-based, nationally representative sample of US adults ages 18 and older using the COVID-19 and Life stressors Impact on Mental Health and Well-being survey (n=1441). We calculated the prevalence of probable depression using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (cut-off &#8805;10) and exposure to financial stressors by financial, physical and social assets categories (household income, household savings, home ownership, educational attainment and marital status). We estimated adjusted ORs and predicted probabilities of probable depression across assets categories and COVID-19 financial stressor exposure groups. RESULTS: We found that (1) 40% of US adults experienced COVID-19-related financial stressors during this time period; (2) low assets (OR: 3.0, 95% CI 2.1 to 4.2) and COVID-19 financial stressor exposure (OR: 2.8, 95% CI 2.1 to 3.9) were each associated with higher odds of probable depression; and (3) among persons with low assets and high COVID-19 financial stressors, 42.7% had probable depression; and among persons with high assets and low COVID-19 financial stressors, 11.1% had probable depression. Persons with high assets and high COVID-19 financial stressors had a similar prevalence of probable depression (33.5%) as persons with low assets and low COVID-19 financial stressors (33.5%). The more assets a person had, the lower the level of probable depression. CONCLUSION: Populations with low assets are bearing a greater burden of mental illness during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Ettman, Catherine K; Abdalla, Salma M; Cohen, Gregory H; Sampson, Laura; Vivier, Patrick M; Galea, Sandro",J. epidemiol. community health (1979),425,10

This has been the focus of intense study for many decades without providing consistent supporting data to link CNS findings to epidemiological risk factors or to the usual clinicopathological findings. Despite this, and the apparent oversight of the link between prone sleep position and respiratory infection, papers citing CNS, cardiac and sleep arousal findings continue to be published. Discovery of the prone sleep position risk factor provided tangential support for the cardiorespiratory control hypothesis which defines the mainstream approach. Despite many decades of research and huge expenditure, no aetiological answer has been forthcoming. In asking why?This paper exposes some of the shortcomings regarding this apparent oversight by mainstream SIDS researchers and examines the role of respiratory infection and puts the case for the ""Infection Hypothesis."" In addition, the paper provides encouragement to neuropathologists to examine the potential link between CNS findings and cardiac function (as opposed to respiratory function) in relation to infection and to examine possible correlates between CNS findings and established risk factors such as recent infection, contaminated sleeping surfaces, maternal/obstetric/higher birth, ethnicity, non-breast-feeding, male gender, etc. or with the usual gross pathological findings of SIDS (intrathoracic petechial hemorrhages, liquid blood, congested lungs).

Patients exhibit growth retardation, delayed bone development, anemia, and bradycardia. By using mouse models of RTHalpha much has been learned about the molecular actions of TRalpha 1 mutants that underlie these abnormalities in adults. Using zebrafish models of RTHalpha that we have recently created, we aimed to understand how TRalpha1 mutants affect the heart function during this period. METHODS: In contrast to human and mice, the thra gene is duplicated, thraa and thrab, in zebrafish. Using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated targeted mutagenesis, we created C-terminal mutations in the each of two duplicated thra genes in zebrafish (thraa 8-bp insertion or thrab 1-bp insertion mutations). We recently showed that these mutant fish faithfully recapitulated growth retardation as found in patients and thra mutant mice. In the present studies, we used histological analysis, gene expression profiles, confocal fluorescence and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to comprehensively analyze the phenotypic characteristics of mutant fish heart during development. RESULTS: We found both a dilated atrium and an abnormally shaped ventricle in adult mutant fish. The retention of red blood cells in the two abnormal heart chambers, and decreased circulating blood speed and reduced expression of contractile genes indicated the weakened contractility in the heart of mutant fish. These abnormalities were detected in mutant fish as early as 35 days post fertilization (juveniles). Further, the expression of genes associated with the sarcomere assembly was suppressed in the heart of mutant fish, resulting in abnormalities of sarcomere organization as revealed by TEM. The abnormal sarcomere organization could underlie the bradycardia exhibited in mutant fish. CONCLUSIONS: Using a zebrafish model of RTHalpha, the present studies demonstrated for the first time that TRalpha mutants could act to cause abnormal heart structure, weaken contractility and disrupt sarcomere organization that affect heart functions. These findings provide new insights into the bradycardia found in RTHalpha patients.","Han, Cho Rong; Wang, Hui; Hoffmann, Victoria; Zerfas, Patricia; Kruhlak, Michael; Cheng, Sheue-Yann",Thyroid,425,16

Early in the pandemic, most hospitals required 2 negative RT-PCR tests before discontinuing isolation in patients with Covid-19. Many patients, however, have persistently positive RT-PCR tests for weeks to months following clinical recovery, and multiple studies now indicate that these generally do not reflect replication-competent virus. SARS-CoV-2 appears to be most contagious around the time of symptom onset, and infectivity rapidly decreases thereafter to near-zero after about 10 days in mild-moderately ill patients and 15 days in severely-critically ill and immunocompromised patients. The longest interval associated with replication-competent virus thus far is 20 days from symptom onset.

Maximizing vaccination requires that we track vaccination patterns to measure the progress of the vaccination campaign and target locations that may be undervaccinated. To improve efforts to track and characterize COVID-19 vaccination progress in the United States, we integrate CDC and state-provided vaccination data, identifying and rectifying discrepancies between these data sources. We find that COVID-19 vaccination coverage in the US exhibits significant spatial heterogeneity at the county level and statistically identify spatial clusters of undervaccination, all with foci in the southern US. Vaccination progress at the county level is also variable; many counties stalled in vaccination into June 2021 and few recovered by July, with transmission of the Delta variant rapidly rising. Using a comparison with a mechanistic growth model fitted to our integrated data, we classify vaccination dynamics across time at the county scale. Our findings underline the importance of curating accurate, fine-scale vaccination data and the continued need for widespread vaccination in the US, especially in the wake of the highly transmissible Delta variant.","Tiu, Andrew; Susswein, Zachary; Merritt, Alexes; Bansal, Shweta",,425,16

Although the majority of SARS-CoV-2 infections in pediatric populations result in minimal or mild COVID-19 in the acute phase of infection, a small subset of children develop severe and even critical disease in this phase with concomitant inflammation that may benefit from immunomodulation. Therefore, guidance is needed regarding immunomodulatory therapies in the setting of acute pediatric COVID-19. This document does not provide guidance regarding the recently emergent multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). METHODS: A multidisciplinary panel of pediatric subspecialty physicians and pharmacists with expertise in infectious diseases, rheumatology, hematology/oncology, and critical care medicine was convened. Guidance statements were developed based on best available evidence and expert opinion. RESULTS: The panel devised a framework for considering the use of immunomodulatory therapy based on an assessment of clinical disease severity and degree of multi-organ involvement combined with evidence of hyperinflammation. Additionally, the known rationale for consideration of each immunomodulatory approach and the associated risks and benefits was summarized. CONCLUSIONS: Immunomodulatory therapy is not recommended for the majority of pediatric patients, who typically develop mild or moderate COVID-19. For children with severe or critical illness, the use of immunomodulatory agents may be beneficial. The risks and benefits of such therapies are variable and should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis with input from appropriate specialty services. When available, the panel strongly favors immunomodulatory agent use within the context of clinical trials. The framework presented herein offers an approach to decision-making regarding immunomodulatory therapy for severe or critical pediatric COVID-19 and is informed by currently available data, while awaiting results of placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials.","Dulek, Daniel E; Fuhlbrigge, Robert C; Tribble, Alison C; Connelly, James A; Loi, Michele M; El Chebib, Hassan; Chandrakasan, Shanmuganathan; Otto, William R; Diorio, Caroline; Keim, Garrett; Walkovich, Kelly; Jaggi, Preeti; Girotto, Jennifer E; Yarbrough, April; Behrens, Edward M; Cron, Randy Q; Bassiri, Hamid",Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society,425,16

At present, the traditional methods for identifying genetically modified and non-transgenic soybeans are time-consuming, costly, and complicated to operate, which cannot meet the needs of practical applications. Therefore, it is necessary to discover a fast and accurate method for identifying transgenic soybeans. Terahertz (THz) time domain spectra were collected in sequence from 225 transgenic and non-transgenic soybean samples. Fourier transform was used to convert the terahertz time domain spectrum into a THz frequency domain spectrum with a frequency range of 0.1-2.5 THz. Firstly, the interval partial least squares (iPLS) method was used to remove interference spectral bands and select appropriate spectral intervals. Secondly, 168 samples were selected as the calibration set. Discriminant partial least squares (DPLS), Grid Search support vector machine (Grid Search-SVM) and principal component analysis back propagation neural network (PCA-BPNN) were used to establish a qualitative identification model. Afterwards, 57 test set samples were predicted. By comparing the experimental results, it was found that iPLS could effectively screen and remove the interference THz band, which was more helpful to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the identification model. After the iPLS and mean center pre-treatment technology, the Grid Search-SVM identification model had the best identification effect, with a total accuracy rate of 98.25% (transgenic identification rate was 96.15%, non-transgenic identification rate was 100%). This study shows that after selecting spectra from iPLS, THz spectroscopy combined with chemometrics can more accurately, quickly, and efficiently identify transgenic and non-transgenic soybeans.","Wei, Xiao; Zheng, Wanqin; Zhu, Shiping; Zhou, Shengling; Wu, Weiji; Xie, Zhiyong",Spectrochim Acta A Mol Biomol Spectrosc,425,30

Currently, it has affected more than 2,850,000 people. No vaccine or drug is available yet, and therefore researchers and scientists are striving to identify potential drugs or vaccines for combating this virus. We were unable to find any review of the literature or analysis on ongoing registered clinical trials that reported diagnostic tests, therapeutics, vaccines and devices for COVID-19 along with estimated enrollment, participants' ages, study type, start and completion date, status, treatment/intervention and country. OBJECTIVE: To review ongoing trials relating to COVID-19. METHODS: A systematic search for clinical trials was conducted in the ClinicalTrials.gov database up to April 12, 2020. A total of 339 trials relating to COVID-19 were analyzed and key information on each trial was recorded. RESULTS: Most of the trials were being conducted in the United States and completion of most of them was expected by May 2020. They were mostly on drugs and treatment, while a minority were on diagnostic tests. The analysis showed that hydroxychloroquine was investigated in most of the trials. The trials identified were categorized into five classes: a) diagnostic tests; b) therapeutics; c) biologics and vaccines; d) devices and products; and e) others. CONCLUSION: The trials identified have potential against COVID-19 that can be applied in treatment processes after the necessary investigations and experiments. Additionally, the items identified were organized in a proper way, which can assist in current research activities.","Rabby, Md Insiat Islam; Hossain, Farzad",Säo Paulo med. j,425,1

In this review, we focus on the significance of Receptor for Advanced Glycation End products (RAGE) as a diagnostic or post-therapeutic prognostic marker for various forms of NSCLCs. RECENT FINDINGS: The lungs have the highest levels of basal RAGE expression in mammals. The physiologic RAGE in lungs may be involved in adhesion and spreading of AT-1 cells and maintenance of pulmonary homeostasis. However, high level expression of RAGE complicates various diseases including acute lung injury. In NSCLCs, while a number of studies report decreased RAGE expression, inferring a protective role, others suggest that RAGE expression may contribute to NSCLC pathogenesis. Genetic polymorphisms of RAGE are reportedly associated with NSCLC development and complications. RAGE and its polymorphic variants may be useful diagnostic or post-therapeutic prognostic markers of NSCLCs.","Mukherjee, Tapan K; Malik, Parth; Hoidal, John R",Curr Oncol Rep,425,29

In this study, the WRF-Chem scenario tests were conducted to evaluate the effect of both the emission and meteorological changes on the winter PM2.5 from 2015 to 2019, especially that of regional transport and local emissions on the PM2.5 variations in HB. The results showed that meteorological changes in January 2019 increased the PM2.5 by 24% relative to January 2015, whereas emissions reduced it by 36%, indicating that emission reduction was vital in improving the air quality in HB. However, the meteorological changes increased the concentration of air pollutants by 10–25% relative to January 2018. This led to a rebound of the observed pollutant concentrations in January 2019, highlighting the importance of meteorological conditions on air pollution. Regional transport of air pollutants contributed to the inter-annual increase of wintertime PM2.5 by 78%, driven purely by meteorology from 2015 to 2019. This indicated that regional PM2.5 transport could aggravate PM2.5 levels in winter over HB with the reduction of air pollutant emissions in China. Additionally, the regional transport of air pollutants contributed to the decrease in PM2.5 in HB by 42%, resulting from the non-local emission reduction during COVID-19 lockdown in winter. This indicates the importance of the regional transport of air pollutants in driving regional changes in the atmospheric environment over China.","Bai, Yongqing Zhao Tianliang Zhou Yue Kong Shaofei Hu Weiyang Xiong Jie Liu Lin Zheng Huang Meng Kai",Atmospheric Pollution Research,425,1

These inhibitors render FVIII replacement therapy ineffective and increase the morbidity and mortality risk. The currently accepted method to eradicate inhibitors is immune tolerance induction (ITI), and frequent intensive administration of FVIII until inhibitor titers drop. Current ITI protocols are extremely costly and not effective in all patients. During the last decade, many types of research have been accomplished to clarify the mechanisms that mediate immune tolerance induction. Novel experimental therapies including monoclonal antibodies, viral vector-mediated gene therapy, regulatory T cell induction using immunosuppressive drugs, and nanoparticle-based immune modulation show promising results in hemophilia A clinical trials.

Travellers visiting friends and relatives (VFR) are at higher risk of acquiring infections than other travellers, therefore improving the travel health behaviour of these travellers is important. Ethnic Chinese are one of the largest migrant groups in many countries, yet there have been no published studies regarding this population as VFR travellers. We present findings of a study of Australian Chinese VFR travellers relevant to the pandemic response. METHODS: In 2013, five focus groups were conducted with Australian Chinese VFR travellers, exploring topics such as vaccines, face masks, outbreaks and travel health seeking behaviour. Participants were aged 18 years or older and had travelled to China for VFR purposes in the preceding 18 months. Sessions were recorded and transcribed, and thematic analysis was undertaken. RESULTS: Participants viewed VFR travel as low risk, and underestimated the risks associated with travelling during an outbreak. However, they were generally willing to receive pre-travel vaccination specifically for an outbreak, but not otherwise. Attitudes towards face masks and other infection control measures were mixed. Multiple factors influenced their travel health behaviour, including low risk awareness, misconceptions, and cultural barriers to seeking health care. CONCLUSION: Our research found that Chinese VFR travellers undertake suboptimal precautions related to VFR travel, associated with an underestimation of risks. While they share many characteristics with other VFR travellers, unique cultural health beliefs should be taken into account when developing risk communication and educational interventions as part of a pandemic response.","Ma, Tara; Heywood, Anita; MacIntyre, C Raina",Infect.

METHODS: Secondary analyses of data from 2 clinical trials of antidepressant pharmacotherapy for GAD (escitalopram vs placebo, 2006-2009) or MDD (open treatment with venlafaxine, 2009-2014) were conducted. Participants included 640 adults aged 60+ years with DSM-IV-defined GAD (n = 177) or MDD (n = 463). Benzodiazepine data were collected at baseline. Adherence and treatment response were assessed over 12 weeks. The analysis addressed whether coprescribed benzodiazepines are associated with treatment response, antidepressant medication adherence, dropout, final dose of antidepressant medication, and report of antidepressant-related adverse effects. RESULTS: Participants with GAD and coprescribed benzodiazepines were treated with a lower mean dosage of escitalopram and were less likely to complete the trial; there was no difference in adherence or treatment response. Participants with MDD and coprescribed benzodiazepines were less likely to tolerate a therapeutic dose of venlafaxine and reported more medication-related adverse effects; there was no difference in adherence, dropout, or treatment response. CONCLUSIONS: Coprescription of benzodiazepines was associated with increased dropout in older patients with GAD and more medication-related adverse effects in older patients with MDD. However, with the systematic clinical attention offered in a clinical trial, they do not impede treatment response. Clinicians should be aware that a coprescribed benzodiazepine may be a marker of a more challenging treatment course.","Altmann, Helene; Stahl, Sarah T; Gebara, Marie Anne; Lenze, Eric J; Mulsant, Benoit H; Blumberger, Daniel M; Reynolds, Charles F; Karp, Jordan F",J. clin. psychiatr,425,26

African countries see slower dynamic of COVID-19 cases and deaths. One of the assumptions that may explain this later emergence in Africa, and more particularly in malaria endemic areas, would be the use of antimalarial drugs. We investigated the in vitro antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 of several antimalarial drugs. Chloroquine (EC50 = 2.1 µM and EC90 = 3.8 µM), hydroxychloroquine (EC50 = 1.5 µM and EC90 = 3.0 µM), ferroquine (EC50 = 1.5 µM and EC90 = 2.4 µM), desethylamodiaquine (EC50 = 0.52 µM and EC90 = 1.9 µM), mefloquine (EC50 = 1.8 µM and EC90 = 8.1 µM), pyronaridine (EC50 = 0.72 µM and EC90 = 0.75 µM) and quinine (EC50 = 10.7 µM and EC90 = 38.8 µM) showed in vitro antiviral effective activity with IC50 and IC90 compatible with drug oral uptake at doses commonly administered in malaria treatment. The ratio Clung/EC90 ranged from 5 to 59. Lumefantrine, piperaquine and dihydroartemisinin had IC50 and IC90 too high to be compatible with expected plasma concentrations (ratio Cmax/EC90 < 0.05). Based on our results, we would expect that countries which commonly use artesunate-amodiaquine or artesunate-mefloquine report fewer cases and deaths than those using artemether-lumefantrine or dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine. It could be necessary now to compare the antimalarial use and the dynamics of COVID-19 country by country to confirm this hypothesis.","Gendrot, Mathieu; Andreani, Julien; Boxberger, Manon; Jardot, Priscilla; Fonta, Isabelle; Le Bideau, Marion; Duflot, Isabelle; Mosnier, Joel; Rolland, Clara; Bogreau, Hervé; Hutter, Sébastien; La Scola, Bernard; Pradines, Bruno",Travel Med Infect Dis,425,29

Despite the emergency vigilance plans, health systems in all countries experienced a different ratio of lethality, amount of admissions to intensive care units and quarantine management of positive patients. The aim of this study is to investigate whether some epidemiological estimates could have been useful in understanding the capacity of the Italian Regional Health Services to manage the COVID-19 epidemic. Methods: We have compared data between two different Italian regions in the Northern part of Italy (Lombardy and Veneto) and the national data to determine whether different health strategies might be significant in explaining dissimilar patterns of the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy. Data have been extracted from a public database and were available only in an aggregated form. Results: The regions in question displayed two different health policies to face the COVID-19 epidemic: while Veneto's health service was largely territorially oriented, Lombardy's strategy was more hospital-centered. Discussion: The key to facing epidemics like this one consists in identifying solutions outside of hospitals. This however requires there be well-trained general practitioners and enough healthcare personnel working outside hospitals.","Castaldi, S.; Luconi, E.; Rivieccio, B.

This paper uses a modelling-based scenario analysis to assess the restriction policies relating to air transport in Argentina, Brazil and Colombia during and after the pandemic and their effects on the environment. The simulation results highlight the need to reduce the negative environmental impact produced by the aviation sector and suggest that policymakers should try to focus on creating ways to reduce the impact made by the aviation industry on the environment, through a coordinated environmental policy between countries, including the three that are the subject of the present case study in order to highlight these issues.","Calderon-Tellez, Javier; Herrera, Milton M",Transp Res Interdiscip Perspect,425,9

Method Prevalence study. The presence of IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 was determined in HCP of the HD. Enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) tests were used. Field work took place from April 24, 2020 to May 8, 2020. The age, sex, occupation (physician, nurse, etc.) and the work area (Primary Care, Emergency Room, etc.) were gathered. The IgG antibody prevalence was then calculated with its 95% confidence interval (95% CI). To study the association between HCP characteristics and the presence IgG the Chi Square test was used, and to study the magnitude of association, the Odds Ratio (95% CI) was calculated. Results Of the 4813 HCP in the HD, 4179 (87,1%) participated. Of these, 73,3% (3065) were women and 26,7% (1114) men. The global prevalence of IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 was 6,6% (95% CI: 5,8–7,3). There were statistically significant differences depending on the occupation, from 8,7% (95% CI: 6,9-10,6) on medics down to 3,2% (95% CI: 1,0-8,0) on personnel not associated with health care. The other characteristics did not associate significantly to antibody presence against SARS-CoV-2. Conclusion The SARS-CoV-2 infection frequency in HCP is similar to the estimated in the general population for big cities in Spain. This highlights the effectiveness of the infection control and prevention programme in this healthcare department targeted at healthcare personnel.

The perceived impact of these practices on patients undergoing essential surgeries is less understood. METHODS: Adult (&#8805;18 years) patients who underwent medically necessary surgical procedures spanning multiple surgical specialties from March 23, 2020, to April 24, 2020, during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic were identified as eligible for a phone survey. Survey responses were analyzed using a mixed-methods approach involving descriptive statistics and thematic analysis of coded and annotated survey results. RESULTS: Of the 212 patients who underwent medically necessary surgical procedures during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, the majority of these patients were male (61.3%), White (83.5%), married or with a domestic partner (68.9%), and underwent oncologic procedures (69.3%). Of the 46 patients (21.7%) who completed the survey, the majority of these patients indicated that coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic restrictions had no impact on their inpatient hospital stay and were satisfied with their decision to proceed with surgery. Severity of patient condition (44.4%), the risk/benefit discussion with the surgeon (24.4%), and coronavirus disease 2019 education and testing (19.5%) were the most important factors in proceeding with surgery during the pandemic; 34.4% of patients said their inpatient postoperative course was negatively affected by the lack of visitors. CONCLUSION: Medically necessary, time-sensitive surgical procedures, as determined by the surgeon, can be performed during a pandemic with good patient satisfaction provided there is an appropriate discussion between the surgeon and patient about the risks and benefits.","Shannon, Adrienne B; Roberson, Jeffrey L; Clapp, Justin T; Vaughan, Casey; Kleid, Melanie; Song, Yun; Miura, John T; Dempsey, Daniel T; DeMatteo, Ronald P; Fleisher, Lee A; Karakousis, Giorgos C",Surgery (St. Louis),425,33

During 2012, a total of 4314 normotensive daytime employees (3153 men and 1161 women) were included in this study. Participants had a wide range of occupations and were employed at one of 12 workplaces from various economic sectors in Japan. After a 2-year follow-up, incident hypertension was compared among groups according to household income: <5.0, 5.0-7.9, 8.0-9.9, and &#8805;10.0 million Japanese yen (¥)/year. A Cox proportional hazard model was used to calculate the hazard ratio for incident hypertension in each household income group, compared with the group earning <5.0 million ¥/year. The hazard ratios for men were 1.52 (95% confidence interval, 1.08-2.18) for 5.0-7.9 million ¥/year, 1.49 (0.98-2.27) for 8.0-9.9 million ¥/year, and 1.92 (1.23-3.01) for &#8805;10.0 million ¥/year after adjusting for age, baseline systolic blood pressure, worksite, type of occupation, number of family members, and smoking status. This positive relationship was attenuated but remained significant after further adjustment for alcohol consumption and body mass index, both of which were higher among men with higher household income. Conversely, there was no significant difference for women in the risk of incident hypertension among household income groups, although those with higher household income tended to have a lower risk of incident hypertension. Household income is positively associated with the onset of hypertension in Japanese employed men working daytime hours.","Yanagiya, Shingo; Nakamura, Koshi; Ukawa, Shigekazu; Tsutsumi, Akizumi; Atsumi, Tatsuya; Tamakoshi, Akiko",Hypertens. res,425,20

The subjects were patients receiving pre-dilution on-line HDF (n = 10) or HD (n = 10) at this hospital. Dialysis time was 4 h for all patients. In patients on HD, the blood flow rate was 200 mL/min and the dialysate flow rate was 463 ± 29.3 mL/min. In patients on pre-dilution on-line HDF, the blood flow rate was 240 ± 20 mL/min, the dialysate flow rate was 565.0 ± 42.5 mL/min, and the substitution flow rate (substitution volume) was 252.8 ± 26.4 mL/min (57.0 ± 6.0 L). Kt/V for urea was comparable between patients on HD and patients on pre-dilution on-line HDF (1.46 ± 0.25 vs. 1.46 ± 0.31). Amino acid loss and clear space were evaluated. Patients on pre-dilution on-line HDF lost significantly less glutamine and arginine (p < 0.01 and p = 0.032) and significantly less nonessential amino acids (NEAAs) than patients on HD (p = 0.013).

Here, we conducted experiments to determine the virucidal activity of commercially available Viral Transport Mediums (VTMs) to inactivate SARS-CoV-2. Independent testing methods for viral inactivation testing were applied, including a previously described World Health Organization (WHO) protocol, in addition to a buffer exchange method where the virus is physically separated from the VTM post exposure. The latter method enables sensitive detection of viral viability at higher viral titre when incubated with VTM. We demonstrate that VTM formulations, Primestore® Molecular Transport Medium (MTM) and COPAN eNAT&#8482; completely inactivate high-titre SARS-CoV-2 virus (>1 × 107 copies/mL) and are compatible with POC processing. Furthermore, full viral inactivation was rapidly achieved in as little as 2 min of VTM exposure.

In this study, we present a novel sample pooling procedure based on compressed sensing theory to accurately identify virally infected patients at high prevalence rates utilizing an innovative viral RNA extraction process to minimize sample dilution. At prevalence rates ranging from 0-14.3%, the number of tests required to identify the infection status of all patients was reduced by 75.6% as compared to conventional testing in primary human SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal swabs and a coronavirus model system. Additionally, our modified pooling and RNA extraction process minimized sample dilution which remained constant as pool sizes increased.

However, outcome data on breast cancer subgroups in the Finnish population is limited. This retrospective registry-based study aimed to assess patient characteristics and clinical outcomes of different breast cancer subgroups in early (EBC) and metastatic breast cancer (MBC) in a real-life clinical setting. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study consisted of 6977 adult female breast cancer patients diagnosed in Southwest Finland during 2005-2018. Patients were divided into four mutually exclusive groups: human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive (HER2+), triple negative, HER2-/hormone receptor positive (HR+), and HER2 and/or HR status unknown, and further into EBC and MBC patients. Real-world (rw) clinical outcomes: disease free survival (rwDFS), progression free survival (rwPFS), overall survival (OS) and distant recurrence-free interval (rwDRFI) were assessed. RESULTS: Within EBC 5-year survival was the highest 88% in HER2-/HR+, 85% in HER2+, and 75% in triple negative. The rwDFS varied significantly in EBC (5-year rwDFS HER2+, triple negative, HER2-/HR+: 80%, 71%, 87% respectively). In MBC median survival was 2 years for both HER2-/HR+ and HER2+, and markedly shorter for triple negative (0.8 years). Independent predictors of mortality were age (HR 1.1), other subgroups than HER2-/HR+ (HR 1.2-1.9), metastatic disease (HR 9.8), and other malignancies (HR 2.7). CONCLUSIONS: This registry-based study demonstrates significant differences in breast cancer outcomes on the subgroup level, as well as poorer outcomes compared to clinical trials, giving complementary insight on clinical characteristics in an unselected patient population. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTISE: This retrospective registry-based study assessed the clinical outcomes of different breast cancer subgroups in 6977 adult female breast cancer patients diagnosed in Southwest Finland during 2005-2018. Results demonstrated significant variation in the survival between subgroups in both EBC and MBC, as well as differences between unselected patients representing the standard of care and randomized clinical trials. Although, according to the global comparison of survival trends, the net survival of breast cancer patients in Finland is generally high, there is great variation between subgroups. This real-life breast cancer data provides tools to further evaluate medical need in different breast cancer subgroups.","Teerenhovi, H; Tuominen, S; Nurmi-Rantala, S; Hemmilä, P; Ellonen, A",Oncologist,425,0

For the past 20â¯years, our laboratory has been developing gene delivery systems based on lipid-based delivery systems. One of our efforts has been directed toward developing a multifunctional envelope-type nano device (MEND) by modifying the particle surface with octaarginine, which resulted in a remarkably enhanced cellular uptake and improved intracellular trafficking of plasmid DNA (pDNA). When we moved to in vivo applications, however, we were faced with the PEG-dilemma and we shifted our strategy to the incorporation of ionizable cationic lipids into our system. This resulted in some dramatic improvements over our original design and this can be attributed to the development of a new lipid library. We have also developed a mitochondrial targeting system based on a membrane fusion mechanism using a MITO-Porter, which can deliver nucleic acids/pDNA into the matrix of mitochondria. After the appearance of antibody medicines, Opdivo, an immune checkpoint inhibitor, has established cancer immunology as the 4th strategy in cancer therapy. Our DDS technologies can also be applied to this new field of cancer therapy to cure cancer by controlling our immune mechanisms.

COVID-19 is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-CoronaVirus-2 (CoV-2) that manifests as bronchitis, pneumonia, or a severe respiratory illness. SARS-CoV-2 infects human cells via binding a ""spike"" protein on its surface to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) within the host. ACE2 is crucial for maintaining tissue homeostasis and negatively regulates the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) in the humans. The RAAS is paramount for normal function in multiple organ systems including the lungs, heart, kidney, and vasculature. Given that SARS-CoV-2 internalizes via ACE2, the resultant disruption in ACE2 expression can lead to altered tissue function and exacerbate chronic diseases. The widespread distribution and expression of ACE2 across multiple organs is critical to our understanding of the varied clinical outcomes of COVID-19. This perspective review based on the current literature was prompted to show how disruption of ACE2 by SARS-CoV-2 can affect different organ systems.","Ashraf, Usman M; Abokor, Ahmed A; Edwards, Jonnelle M; Waigi, Emily W; Royfman, Rachel S; Hasan, Syed Abdul-Moiz; Smedlund, Kathryn B; Hardy, Ana Maria Gregio; Chakravarti, Ritu; Koch, Lauren G",Physiol. genomics,425,6

The performance and precision of this equipment are solely dependent on the sensors being used. The advancement in research and development of micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) based sensors during recent years, has resulted in the improvement of the conventional equipment being used in biomedical and health care applications. Microfluidics (Lab-on-a-chip) and MEMS sensors are now being used extensively for quick and accurate detection, progression monitoring, and treatment of various diseases including Covid-19. The ongoing miniaturization and design improvements have resulted in more precise sensors and actuators for healthcare applications, even for micro and nanoscale measurements in drug delivery and other invasive applications. This article aims at reviewing the MEMS sensors being used or which can be used in the important equipment for the detection and treatment of Covid-19 or other pandemics. An insight into various designs and working principles of the research-based and commercially available MEMS sensors is presented. The study highlights the role and importance of MEMS sensors in the improvement of equipment with conventional sensors. MEMS sensors outperform the conventional sensors due to their small size (1&#x03BC;m-1mm), negligible weight, prompt response, precise measurements, portability, and ease of integration with electronic circuitry.

Finally, we build increasingly complex and realistic models, ranging from simple homogeneous models used to estimate local reproduction numbers, to fully coupled inhomogeneous (deterministic or stochastic) models incorporating mobility estimates from cell phone location data. The models are capable of producing forecasts highly consistent with the official number of cases with minimal parameter fitting and fine-tuning. We discuss the strengths and limitations of the proposed models, focusing on the validity of different necessary first approximations, and caution future modeling efforts to exercise great care in the interpretation of long-term forecasts, and in the adoption of non-pharmaceutical interventions backed by numerical simulations.","Tagliazucchi, E; Balenzuela, P; Travizano, M; Mindlin, G B; Mininni, P D",Chaos Solitons Fractals,425,5

Sixty percent of donors had nAb titers &#8805;1:80. Correlates of higher nAb titers included older age (adjusted OR [AOR] 1.03 per year of age, 95% CI 1.00-1.06), male sex (AOR 2.08, 95% CI 1.13-3.82), fever during illness (AOR 2.73, 95% CI 1.25-5.97), and disease severity represented by hospitalization (AOR 6.59, 95% CI 1.32-32.96). Receiver operating characteristic analyses of anti-S1 and anti-NP antibody results yielded cutoffs that corresponded well with nAb titers, with the anti-S1 assay being slightly more predictive. nAb titers declined in 37 of 41 paired specimens collected a median of 98 days (range 77-120) apart (P < 0.001).

Aging and age-related diseases have multiple causes. Parabiosis experiments, in which the circulatory systems of young and old mice were surgically joined, revealed that young plasma counteracts aging and rejuvenates organs in old mice, suggesting the existence of rejuvenating factors that become less abundant with aging. Diverse approaches have identified a large number of plasma proteins whose levels differ significantly between young and old mice, as well as numerous rejuvenating factors that reverse aged-related impairments in multiple tissues. These observations suggest that increasing the levels of key rejuvenating factors could promote restorative biological processes or inhibit pathological degeneration.

We performed an international survey aimed to investigate the medium- and long-term impact on oncology units. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An 82-item survey was distributed from June 17 to July 14, 2020 among medical oncologists worldwide. RESULTS: One hundred nine medical oncologists from 18 countries in Europe (n = 93), United States (n = 5), and Latin America (n = 11) answered the survey. A systematic tracing of COVID-19-positive patients was continued in the postacute phase by 77.1% of the centers; 64.2% of the respondents participated in a local registry and 56% in international or national registries of infected patients. Treatment adaptations were introduced, and surgery was the most affected modality being delayed or canceled in more than 10% of patients in 34% of the centers, whereas early cessation of palliative treatment was reported in 32.1% of the centers; 64.2% of respondents reported paying attention to avoid undertreatments. The use of telemedicine has been largely increased. Similarly, virtual tools are increasingly used particularly for medical education and international or national or multidisciplinary meetings. 60.6% of the participants reduced clinical activity, and 28.4% compensated by increasing their research activity. Significant reduction of clinical trial activities is expected in 37% of centers this year. The well-being of healthcare staff would not recover by the end of the year according to 18% of the participants. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 outbreak has had a major impact on oncologic activity, which will persist in the future, irrespective of geographical areas.","Onesti, Concetta Elisa; Tagliamento, Marco; Curigliano, Giuseppe; Harbeck, Nadia; Bartsch, Rupert; Wildiers, Hans; Tjan-Heijnen, Vivianne; Martin, Miguel; Rottey, Sylvie; Generali, Daniele; Campone, Mario; Cristofanilli, Massimo; Pusztai, Lajos; Peeters, Marc; Berchem, Guy; Cortes, Javier; Ruhstaller, Thomas; Ciruelos, Eva; Rugo, Hope S; Jerusalem, Guy",JCO Glob Oncol,425,26

A few studies have highlighted virus presence on surfaces. We report the evidence of its presence on hospital surfaces, in a single room hosting a patient whose nose-pharyngeal swab resulted positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA at the admission. The surfaces sampling was carried out using pre-wetted swabs followed by extraction and amplification of viral RNA by reverse Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (rRT-PCR). A total of 4/15 (26.66%) surfaces were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA: the right bed rail, the call button, the bed trapeze bar, the stethoscope; moreover, the patient's inner surgical mask was positive, showing the emission of the virus from the patient. This study is a further confirmation that the surfaces represent a potential vehicle of transmission.

METHODS: We retrospectively analysed characteristics, glucometrics and inflammatory markers of patients with diabetes mellitus admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) with COVID-19. RESULTS: Eight patients with diabetes were admitted to ICU with COVID-19. All had type 2 diabetes, with three being newly diagnosed that admission. Mean HbA1c was 9.2%. Glucometric analysis indicated that extremely high insulin doses were required during peak inflammatory response to maintain glycaemic control with a mean peak insulin requirement of 201 units per day (2.2 units/kg/day). CONCLUSIONS: Critically unwell patients with diabetes mellitus and COVID-19 had high insulin requirements and poorer time in target range at the time of peak inflammatory response, and this improved as their illness resolved.","Wu, Linda; Girgis, Christian M; Cheung, Ngai Wah",Clin. endocrinol,425,16

Since most test sets are constructed as an i.i.d. sample from the overall data, this approach overly simplifies the complexity of language and encourages overfitting to the head of the data distribution. As such, rare language phenomena or text about underrepresented groups are not equally included in the evaluation. To encourage more in-depth model analyses, researchers have proposed the use of multiple test sets, also called challenge sets, that assess specific capabilities of a model. In this paper, we develop a framework based on this idea which is able to generate controlled perturbations and identify subsets in text-to-scalar, text-to-text, or data-to-text settings. By applying this framework to the GEM generation benchmark, we propose an evaluation suite made of 80 challenge sets, demonstrate the kinds of analyses that it enables and shed light onto the limits of current generation models.","Mille, Simon; Dhole, Kaustubh D.; Mahamood, Saad; Perez-Beltrachini, Laura; Gangal, Varun; Kale, Mihir; Miltenburg, Emiel van; Gehrmann, Sebastian",,425,16
486815,486815,486815,A Surveillance System for the Maternal and Child Health (MCH) Population During the COVID-19 Pandemic,19.38245,3.963251,2020,"OBJECTIVES: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged and rapidly spread worldwide. Several countries have imposed lockdown and isolation in attempt to mitigate viral spread. However, social isolation has a negative effect on psychological aspects, increasing stress, fear, anxiety, anger and emotional disturbance, as well as affecting sleep pattern and the practice of physical activity. Negative emotions and lifestyle changes trigger overeating, consequently affecting dietary practices. The aim of this study was to verify the prevalence of lifestyle factors (i.e., sleep time/quality and practice of physical exercise), eating behavior dimensions, chronotype, and association with dietary practices (planning, domestic organization, food choice, ways of eating) in home confinement during the COVID-19 pandemic in São Paulo, Brazil. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted between April 27 and May 25, 2020. An anonymous online questionnaire (Microsoft Forms) was used for data collection by the snowball method. We verified dietary practices (outcome), eating behavior, physical exercise practice, sleep quality and duration, and chronotype (exposure variables). Sex, age, educational and social status were assessed as covariates and confounders. We evaluated 724 adults (585 women and 139 men). Mean age was 32.6 y (±11.3) for women and 33.5 y (±10.5) for men. RESULTS: Emotional eating (EE) and binge eating (BE) were positively correlated (r = 0.66; P <0.001). Dietary practices were negatively correlated with BE (r = -0.41; P <0.001), EE (r = -0.33; P <0.001) and body mass index (r = -0.24; P <0.001). Linear regression demonstrated that EE (ß = -0.1351; t = -2.841; P = 0.005; Î·p2 = 0.013), BE (ß = -0.2580; t = -5.612; P < 0.001; Î·p2 = 0.050), no practice of physical exercise at home (ß = -0.4271; t = -5.933; P < 0.001; Î·p2 = 0.055), being vespertine (ß = -0.3435; t = 2.076; P = 0.038; Î·p2 = 0.019), and age (ß = -0.082; t = -2.210; P = 0.027; Î·p2 = 0.008) are negative predictors of dietary practices. Finally, cognitive restraint (ß = 0.1407; t = 3.858; P < 0.001; Î·p2 = 0.024), better sleep quality (ß = 0.1768; t = 2.506; P = 0.012; Î·p2 = 0.010), receiving 4-10 wages per month (according to a minimum wage in Brazil that corresponds to US $ 183.01) (ß = 0.2568; t = 2.573; P = 0.10; Î·p2 = 0.027) and 10 - 20 wages per month (ß = 0.4490; t = 3.726; P < 0.001; Î·p2 = 0.027) are positive predictors of dietary practices. CONCLUSION: Eating behavior, physical exercise, sleep, and social factors can be important predictors for dietary practices during COVID-19 social confinement. Longitudinal studies in Brazil are needed to confirm these findings.","Dos Santos Quaresma, Marcus Vl; Marques, Camila Guazzelli; Magalhães, Ana Carolina Oumatu; Dos Santos, Ronaldo Vagner Thomatieli",Nutrition,425,20

The ""Troubling Trichotomy"" of what can be done technologically, what should be done ethically, and what must be done legally is a reality during these unusual circumstances. Recent ethical considerations regarding allocation of scarce resources, such as mechanical ventilators, have been proposed. These can apply to other disciplines such as nutrition support, although decisions regarding nutrition support have a diminished potential for devastating outcomes. The principal values and goals leading to an ethical framework for a uniform, fair, and objective approach are reviewed in this article, with a focus on nutrition support. Some historical aspects of shortages in nutrition supplies and products during normal circumstances, as well as others during national crises, are outlined. The development and implementation of protocols using a scoring system seems best addressed by multidisciplinary ethics and triage committees with synergistic but disparate functions. Triage committees should alleviate the burdens of unilateral decisions by the healthcare team caring for patients. The treating team should make every attempt to have patients and the public at large update or execute/develop advance directives. Legal considerations, as the third component of the Troubling Trichotomy, are of some concern when rationing care. The likelihood that criminal or civil charges could be brought against individual healthcare professionals or institutions can be minimized, if fair protocols are uniformly applied and deliberations well documented.","Barrocas, Albert; Schwartz, Denise Baird; Hasse, Jeanette M; Seres, David S; Mueller, Charles M",Nutr Clin Pract,425,33

METHODS: Three N95 masks of different makes (A, B and C) were subjected to six decontamination methods: ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, isopropyl alcohol (IPA) dip, plasma sterilization (Sterrad®), ethylene oxide (ETO, 3M®), dry heat sterilization, and moist heat sterilization (autoclaving). The integrity of the N95 masks was assessed by measuring their particle filtering efficiency at particle sizes ranging 0.3-0.5 microns. RESULTS: All the masks decontaminated with ETO and plasma sterilization retained over 95% particle filtering efficiency. Masks decontaminated using IPA dip and autoclaving showed a drop, and UV irradiation showed variations in particle size efficiency degradation after decontamination. CONCLUSIONS: Plasma sterilization is recommended for decontamination of N95 masks in low-resource settings. ETO is not recommended due to hazards associated with handling of ethylene oxide, although the filtering efficiency was retained. Since the UV irradiation method showed variations in results, evaluation of UV decontamination for N95 masks needs to be performed on a case-by-case basis.","Rohit, Anusha; Rajasekaran, Shankar; Shenoy, Suchitra; Rai, Sumit; Iddya, Karunasagar; Dorairajan, Suresh Kumar",Int J Infect Dis,425,24

The samples were tested by specific real-time RT-PCRs targeting SARS-CoV-2, influenza viruses, and RSVs. Results: Of these NPSs, 31% tested positive for influenza viruses, 10% for SARS-CoV-2, and 7% for RSV. No coinfections were detected. Influenza viruses and RSVs circulated throughout the surveillance period until the end of February (week 9-2020), when they suddenly ceased to circulate seven weeks earlier than during the previous five influenza seasons. After the first detection of SARS-CoV-2 in our ILI outpatients at the beginning of March (week 10-2020), SARS-CoV-2 remained the only virus identified throughout the surveillance period. Patients &#8805; 65 years had a 3.2-fold greater risk of being infected with SARS-CoV-2, while school-age children (5-14 years) and children < 5 years proved to be the age groups most at risk of contracting influenza viruses and RSV, respectively. Our experience demonstrates that laboratory-based ILI surveillance networks are essential for identifying SARS-CoV-2 cases that would otherwise remain undetected, in order to stop their spread within our communities.","Galli, Cristina; Pellegrinelli, Laura; Bubba, Laura; Primache, Valeria; Anselmi, Giovanni; Delbue, Serena; Signorini, Lucia; Binda, Sandro; Cereda, Danilo; Gramegna, Maria; Pariani, Elena",Viruses,425,1

The objective of our study was to determine the efficacy of synergistic treatment of daptomycin when given with either cefazolin or cloxacillin for the treatment of MSSA BSI. METHODS: A randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial was performed at two academic hospitals in Montreal, Canada. Patients &#8805; 18 years of age with MSSA BSI receiving either cefazolin or cloxacillin monotherapy were considered for inclusion. In addition to the standard of care treatment, participants received a 5-day course of adjunctive daptomycin or placebo. The primary outcome was the duration of MSSA BSI in days. RESULTS: Of 318 participants screened, 115 were enrolled and 104 were included in the intention to treat analysis (median age 67 years; 34.5% female). The median duration of bacteremia was 2.04 days among patients who received daptomycin versus 1.65 days in those who received placebo (absolute difference 0.39 days, p=0.40).

Therefore, enhancing the quality of health services is needed so as to avoid claims and disappointments. To this end, reducing the patients' waiting times in the oncology units represents one of the main goals of any healthcare manager. Simulation models are considered an effective tool for identifying potential ways to improve the patient flow in an oncology unit. This paper presents a new agent-based simulation model properly designed to be configurable and adaptable to the needs of the oncology departments that have to interact with an external pharmacy. In these cases, a courier service is needed to deliver the therapies, collected in several batches, from the pharmacy to the oncology department. A real oncology unit was studied through the agent-based simulation and alternative scenarios were compared with the aim of selecting the ward configuration capable of reducing the patients' waiting time.","Corsini, R.

The impact of school closures on children with disabilities poses significant ramifications for the medical, behavioral health, and educational systems in which they are served, necessitating the need for pediatric clinicians to collaborate with schools in purposeful ways. This commentary (1) presents an overview of the current guidance for providing school-based services to children with disabilities during the COVID context with many schools operating in virtual or hybrid formats, (2) reviews potential service inequities exacerbated by school closures and lack of on-site services, and (3) offers recommendations for collaborating with school staff and community agencies in support of children and families with disabilities.","Harris, Bryn; McClain, Maryellen Brunson; O039,; Leary, Sonja; Shahidullah, Jeffrey D",J Dev Behav Pediatr,425,22

The number of outward and inward daily commuters was extracted from national census databases related to the population and their commuting habits. For urban area A, with the larger number of daily inward commuters (110,000, compared to 53,000 for B), lockdown was observed to have an effect on the monthly load averages of chemical oxygen demand, biochemical oxygen demand, total Kjeldahl nitrogen, total suspended solids and total phosphorus, all of which decreased (confidence level of 95%). This decrease, which varied between 20% and 40% and reached 45% for COD, can be related to the cessation of catering and activities such as hairdressing, which generate large amounts of graywater. The ammonium loads, due to the use of toilets before leaving for work and after returning from work, remained constant. In the case of urban area B, lockdown had no noticeable effect.

Parental care positively influencesthe outcomesofchildren with T1D, while there are often criticisms in school environment. The COVID-19 pandemic has forced children and parents to spend many hours at home and diabetes care has returned mainly in the hands of parents. AIM OF THE STUDY: To evaluate the effectiveness of exclusive return to parental care in pre-school and school children with T1D treated with Tandem Basal IQ system during the COVID-19 pandemic. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 22 children (M:F = 14:8) with T1D have been evaluated. We compared insulin and CGM data (TIR, TBR and TAR) of two periods: PRE-COV and IN-COV, in which children have transitioned from normal school attendance to the exclusive care of their parents. RESULTS: During the IN-COV period a significantly (p < 0.001) higher median value of TIR (66,41%) was observed as compared to PRE-COV period (61,45%). Patients also showed a statistically significant difference (p < 0.002) between the IN-COV period and the PRE-COV period as concerning the TAR metric: respectively 29,86 ± 10,6% vs 34,73 ± 12,8%. The difference between the bolus insulin doses was statistically significant (PRE-COV 5,3 IU/day, IN-COV 7,9 IU/day - p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Our observational real-life study confirms the positive effect of parental care in T1D very young children and demonstrates that during the COVID-19 pandemic it was possible to obtain a good glycometabolic compensation despite the significant change in lifestyle.","Schiaffini, Riccardo; Barbetti, Fabrizio; Rapini, Novella; Inzaghi, Elena; Deodati, Annalisa; Patera, Ippolita P; Matteoli, Maria C; Ciampalini, Paolo; Carducci, Chiara; Lorubbio, Antonella; Schiaffini, Gabriele; Cianfarani, Stefano",Diabetes Res Clin Pract,425,16

With the escalating impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on society in the United States and around the world, the CDC has become one of the focal points of public discussion. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify the topics and their overarching themes emerging from the public COVID-19-related discussion about the CDC on Twitter and to further provide insight into public's concerns, focus of attention, perception of the CDC's current performance, and expectations from the CDC. METHODS: Tweets were downloaded from a large-scale COVID-19 Twitter chatter data set from March 11, 2020, when the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic, to August 14, 2020. We used R (The R Foundation) to clean the tweets and retain tweets that contained any of five specific keywords-cdc, CDC, centers for disease control and prevention, CDCgov, and cdcgov-while eliminating all 91 tweets posted by the CDC itself. The final data set included in the analysis consisted of 290,764 unique tweets from 152,314 different users. We used R to perform the latent Dirichlet allocation algorithm for topic modeling. RESULTS: The Twitter data generated 16 topics that the public linked to the CDC when they talked about COVID-19. Among the topics, the most discussed was COVID-19 death counts, accounting for 12.16% (n=35,347) of the total 290,764 tweets in the analysis, followed by general opinions about the credibility of the CDC and other authorities and the CDC's COVID-19 guidelines, with over 20,000 tweets for each. The 16 topics fell into four overarching themes: knowing the virus and the situation, policy and government actions, response guidelines, and general opinion about credibility. CONCLUSIONS: Social media platforms, such as Twitter, provide valuable databases for public opinion. In a protracted pandemic, such as COVID-19, quickly and efficiently identifying the topics within the public discussion on Twitter would help public health agencies improve the next-round communication with the public.","Lyu, Joanne Chen; Luli, Garving K",J Med Internet Res,425,16

These calls, like current regulations, focus on individualized risk assessments around consent, coercion, and harm, while ignoring the unnaturalness of deprivation conditions in U.S. prisons. We need new frameworks of analysis that refocus on structural, rather than individual, risk assessments. Integrating structural perspectives-including skepticism of claims of scarcity, avoidance of representational distortions, and attention to institutional agency-into our existing, overly individualistic frameworks might permit the design of more ethical research projects involving people who are incarcerated. Still, the unnatural deprivations of incarceration might be so great that research subjects might need to be removed from prison entirely in order to ethically participate in research.","Reiter, Keramet",Hastings Cent Rep,425,1

Actual data for deposits by holder are unavailable. We use a dataset on banks' financial information and probabilistic generative model to predict industry retail-wholesale deposit split from 2000 to 2020. Our model assumes account balances arise from separate retail and wholesale lognormal distributions and fit parameters of distributions by minimizing error between actual bank metrics and simulated metrics using the model's generative process. We use time-series regression to forward predict retail-wholesale deposits as function of loans, retail loans, and reserve balances at Fed banks. We find increase in reserves (representing QE) increases wholesale but not retail deposits, and increase in loans increase both wholesale and retail deposits evenly. The result shows that QE following the 2008 financial crisis benefited large companies more than average individuals, a relevant finding for economic decision making. In addition, this work benefits bank management strategy by providing forecasting capability for retail-wholesale deposits.","Zhan, Ni",,425,20

Under an epidemic of SARS-CoV-2, the COVID-19 state of emergency in Japan served as a nationwide social experiment to investigate the impact of quarantine or isolation on the incidence of KD. Objective: To assess the role of droplet or contact transmission in the etiopathogenesis of KD. Design, Setting, and Participants: This multicenter, longitudinal, cross-sectional study was conducted from 2015 to 2020 at Fukuoka Children's Hospital and 5 adjacent general hospitals. The number of admissions for KD and infectious diseases were analyzed. Participants were pediatric patients admitted to the participating hospitals for KD or infectious diseases. Exposures: Quarantine and isolation owing to the COVID-19 state of emergency. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary end points were the ratios of patients with KD to patients with respiratory tract or gastrointestinal infections admitted from April to May in 2015 to 2019 and 2020. A Poisson regression model was used to analyze them. Results: The study participants included 1649 patients with KD (median [interquartile range] age, 25 [13-43] months; 901 boys [54.6%]) and 15â¯586 patients with infectious disease (data on age and sex were not available for these patients). The number of admissions for KD showed no significant change between April and May in 2015 to 2019 vs the same months in 2020 (mean [SD], 24.8 [5.6] vs 18.0 [4.0] admissions per month; 27.4% decrease; adjusted incidence rate ratio [aIRR], 0.73; 95% CI, 0.48-1.10; P = .12). However, the number of admissions for droplet-transmitted or contact-transmitted respiratory tract infections (mean [SD], 157.6 [14.4] vs 39.0 [15.0] admissions per month; 75.3% decrease; aIRR, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.17-0.35; P < .001) and gastrointestinal infections (mean [SD], 43.8 [12.9] vs 6.0 [2.0] admissions per month; 86.3% decrease; aIRR, 0.14; 95% CI, 0.04-0.43; P < .001) showed significant decreases between April and May in 2015 to 2019 vs the same months in 2020 (total, 12â¯254 infections). Thus, the ratio of KD to droplet- or contact-transmitted respiratory tract and gastrointestinal infections incidence in April and May 2020 was significantly increased (ratio, 0.40 vs 0.12; &#967;21 = 22.76; P < .001). Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, the significantly increased incidence of KD compared with respiratory tract and gastrointestinal infections during the COVID-19 state of emergency suggests that contact or droplet transmission is not a major route for KD development and that KD may be associated with airborne infections in most cases.","Hara, Takuya; Furuno, Kenji; Yamamura, Kenichiro; Kishimoto, Junji; Mizuno, Yumi; Murata, Kenji; Onoyama, Sagano; Hatae, Ken; Takemoto, Megumi; Ishizaki, Yoshito; Kanno, Shunsuke; Sato, Kazuo; Motomura, Yoshitomo; Sakai, Yasunari; Ohga, Shouichi; Yashiro, Mayumi; Nakamura, Yoshikazu; Hara, Toshiro",JAMA Netw Open,425,20

Here, we present an innovative, stepwise approach to participatory modelling of the COVID-19 pandemic that engaged decision-makers and public health professionals from countries throughout all stages of the modelling process. Our approach consisted of first identifying the relevant policy questions, collecting country-specific data and interpreting model findings from a decision-maker's perspective, as well as communicating model uncertainty.

Our model describes the multiple transmission pathways in the infection dynamics, and emphasizes the role of the environmental reservoir in the transmission and spread of this disease. Our model also employs non-constant transmission rates which change with the epidemiological status and environmental conditions and which reflect the impact of the on-going disease control measures. We conduct a detailed analysis of this model, and demonstrate its application using publicly reported data. Among other findings, our analytical and numerical results indicate that the coronavirus infection would remain endemic, which necessitates long-term disease prevention and intervention programs.","Yang, Cha Yu; Wang, Jin",Math Biosci Eng,425,33

A 2-radiographer mobile radiography team is required to perform bedside Chest X-rays (CXR) for these patients. Hospital guidelines require both radiographers to be in full Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) throughout the image acquisition process and the mobile radiographic unit needs to be disinfected twice after each case. This affects the efficiency of the procedure and an increase usage of limited PPE resources. This study aims to explore the feasibility of performing mobile chest radiography with the mobile radiographic unit in a ""clean"" zone of the hospital ward. METHODS: An anthropomorphic body phantom was used during the test. With the mobile radiographic unit placed in a ""clean"" zone, the phantom and the mobile radiographic unit was segregated by the room door with a clear glass panel. The test was carried out with the room door open and closed. Integrated radiation level and patient dose were measured. A consultant radiologist was invited to review and score all the images acquired using a Barco Medical Grade workstation. The Absolute Visual Grading Analysis (VGA) scoring system was used to score these images. RESULTS: A VGA score of 4 was given to all the 40 test images, suggesting that there is no significant differences in the image quality of the images acquired using the 2 different methods. Radiation exposure received by the patient at the highest kV setting through the glass is comparable to the regular CXR on patient without glass panel at 90 kV, suggesting that there is no significant increase in patient dose. CONCLUSION: The result suggests that acquiring CXR with the X-ray beam attenuating through a glass panel is a safe and feasible way of performing CXR for COVID-19 patients in the newly converted COVID wards. This will allow the mobile radiographic unit as well as one radiographer to be completely segregated from the patient. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This new method of acquiring CXR in an isolation facility set up requires a 2-Radiographer mobile radiography team, and is applicable only for patients who are generally well and not presented with any mobility issues. It is also important to note that a clear glass panel must be present in the barriers set up for segregation between the ""clean"" zone and patient zone in order to use this new method of acquiring CXR.","Sng, L H; Arlany, L; Toh, L C; Loo, T Y; Ilzam, N S; Wong, B S S; Lanca, L",,425,19

A wide variety of liver function test abnormalities and few cases of severe liver failure have been reported. No data on the hepatic phenotype from Europe are available at current. METHODS: We report a case series of 44 consecutive patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in Germany. RESULTS: At the time of admission, aspartate aminotransferase greater than the upper limit of normal was present in 70%, while alanine aminotransferase was elevated in 15.8%. Markers of cholestatic liver injury were altered only in a minority of patients. During hospitalization, 31% and 22% experienced increasing aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase, respectively, when transaminases were normal at admission. Severe liver injury defined by 3×> upper limit of normal was observed in 9.1% over a mean time of 10.5 days.

The effects of obesity on clinical outcomes of COVID-19 warrant systematical investigation. OBJECTIVE: This study explores the effects of obesity with the risk of severe disease among patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Body mass index (BMI) and degree of visceral adipose tissue (VAT) accumulation were used as indicators for obesity status. Publication databases including preprints were searched up to August 10, 2020. Clinical outcomes of severe COVID-19 included hospitalization, a requirement for treatment in an intensive care unit (ICU), invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), and mortality. Risks for severe COVID-19 outcomes are presented as odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95%CI) for cohort studies with BMI-defined obesity, and standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95%CI for controlled studies with VAT-defined excessive adiposity. RESULTS: A total of 45, 650 participants from 30 studies with BMI-defined obesity and 3 controlled studies with VAT-defined adiposity were included for assessing the risk of severe COVID-19. Univariate analyses showed significantly higher ORs of severe COVID-19 with higher BMI: 1.76 (95%: 1.21, 2.56, Pâ¯=â¯0.003) for hospitalization, 1.67 (95%CI: 1.26, 2.21, P<0.001) for ICU admission, 2.19 (95%CI: 1.56, 3.07, P<0.001) for IMV requirement, and 1.37 (95%CI: 1.06, 1.75, Pâ¯=â¯0.014) for death, giving an overall OR for severe COVID-19 of 1.67 (95%CI: 1.43, 1.96; P<0.001). Multivariate analyses revealed increased ORs of severe COVID-19 associated with higher BMI: 2.36 (95%CI: 1.37, 4.07, Pâ¯=â¯0.002) for hospitalization, 2.32 (95%CI: 1.38, 3.90, Pâ¯=â¯0.001) for requiring ICU admission, 2.63 (95%CI: 1.32, 5.25, Pâ¯=â¯0.006) for IMV support, and 1.49 (95%CI: 1.20, 1.85, P<0.001) for mortality, giving an overall OR for severe COVID-19 of 2.09 (95%CI: 1.67, 2.62; P<0.001). Compared to non-severe COVID-19 patients, severe COVID-19 cases showed significantly higher VAT accumulation with a SMD of 0.49 for hospitalization (95% CI: 0.11, 0.87; Pâ¯=â¯0.011), 0.57 (95% CI: 0.33, 0.81; P<0.001) for requiring ICU admission and 0.37 (95% CI: 0.03, 0.71; Pâ¯=â¯0.035) for IMV support. The overall SMD for severe COVID-19 was 0.50 (95% CI: 0.33, 0.68; P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Obesity increases risk for hospitalization, ICU admission, IMV requirement and death among patients with COVID-19. Further, excessive visceral adiposity appears to be associated with severe COVID-19 outcomes. These findings emphasize the need for effective actions by individuals, the public and governments to increase awareness of the risks resulting from obesity and how these are heightened in the current global pandemic.","Huang, Yi; Lu, Yao; Huang, Yan-Mei; Wang, Min; Ling, Wei; Sui, Yi; Zhao, Hai-Lu",Metabolism,425,21

This article summarizes the clinical treatment process and clinical data of patients with COVID-19 and analyzes the predictive factors for mechanical ventilation for these patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective study was carried out from January 5, 2020, to March 23, 2020, including 98 patients with COVID-19 treated at three designated hospitals in Huangshi City, Hubei Province. Data collection included demographics, previous underlying diseases, clinical manifestations, laboratory examinations, imaging examination results, diagnosis, and prognosis. This study presents a summary of the patients' overall clinical characteristics and clarifies the predictive factors for MV in patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: There were 56 males and 42 females included in this study. The mortality rate was 26.53% (26/98). Fever, cough, and chest tightness were the most common symptoms (64.3%, 37.8%, and 12.2%, respectively). Thirty cases required MV, 30.61% of the total cases, and the mortality rate was 73.33%. The univariate comparison showed that dyspnea, acute physiologic assessment, chronic health evaluation (APACHE II) score, and the ratio between arterial blood oxygen partial pressure (PaO2) and oxygen concentration (FiO2) (P/F) were statistically different between the MV group and the non-MV group (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Results showed the following: dyspnea; increased white blood cell count; decreased platelets; lowered albumin levels; increased urea nitrogen; increased levels of myocardial enzymes Creatine Kinase (CK), Creatine Kinase, MB Form (CKMB) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH); increased lactate, and lowered blood calcium tests. These findings may indicate that the patients have an increased probability of needing MV support. A cutoff value for the initial APACHE II score of >11.5 and the initial PaO2/FiO2 ratio of <122.17 mmHg should be considered for MV support for patients with COVID-19.","Chen, J; Zhu, Y-F; Du, Z-Q; Li, W-F; Zhang, M-J; Zhao, S-D; Ying, J-W; Li, Z; Miao, H-J",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,425,1

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has provided funding for evidence-based behavioral interventions (EBIs) at health departments and community-based organizations (CBOs) since 2004. From 2006 to 2015, CDC funded 25 CBOs to evaluate one or more of seven EBIs designed to prevent HIV through the Community-based Organization Behavioral Outcomes Project (CBOP) as implemented outside of a research setting. For each EBI, CBOP showed that most HIV risk behaviors improved after the intervention, and improvements were similar to those observed in research studies. Our findings show that behavioral interventions can be successfully implemented in real-world settings. Although the focus of HIV prevention has largely shifted toward biomedical interventions in recent years, successful implementation often depends on behavioral components.

Guided by a pre-analysis plan, we estimate the effect of COVID-19 cases and deaths on the change in county-level voting for Donald Trump between 2016 and 2020. To account for potential confounders, we include a large number of COVID-19-related controls as well as demographic and socioeconomic variables. Moreover, we instrument the numbers of cases and deaths with the share of workers employed in meat-processing factories to sharpen our identification strategy. We find that COVID-19 cases negatively affected Trump's vote share. The estimated effect appears strongest in urban counties, in states without stay-at-home orders, in swing states, and in states that Trump won in 2016. A simple counterfactual analysis suggests that Trump would likely have won re-election if COVID-19 cases had been 5 percent lower.

Recent studies highlighted the significant role of research leadership in collaborations. However, existing measures of the research leadership do not take into account the intensity of leadership in the co-authorship network. More importantly, the spatial features, which influence the collaboration patterns and research outcomes, have not been incorporated in measuring the research leadership. To fill the gap, we construct an institution-level weighted co-authorship network that has two types of weight on the edges: the intensity of collaborations and the spatial score (the geographic distance adjusted by the cross-border nature). Based on this network, we propose a novel metric, namely the spatial research leadership rank (SpatialLeaderRank), to identify the leading institutions while considering both the collaboration intensity and the spatial features. Harnessing a dataset of 323,146 journal publications in pharmaceutical sciences during 2010-2018, we perform a comprehensive analysis of the geographical distribution and dynamic patterns of research leadership flows at the institution level. The results demonstrate that the SpatialLeaderRank outperforms baseline metrics in predicting the scholarly impact of institutions.

As of July 2020, there were 8,475 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Ethiopia, and a total of 52 cases and 1 death were reported in Debre Berhan where this study was conducted. Under these conditions, we sought to assess what undergraduate students at Debre Berhan University knew about COVID-19 and how it shaped their attitudes and practices regarding this disease. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the current study was to assess undergraduate student knowledge, attitudes and practices towards COVID-19 in Debre Berhan University, Ethiopia. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted from March 18-24, 2020 among undergraduate students at Debre Berhan University. A two-stage cluster sampling technique was employed with a total sample size of 634. Proportional allocation of samples was used to the randomly selected colleges, and a systematic random sampling technique was employed to recruit the students. The data were checked for completeness, coded, entered into Epi-Data VS 3.1, and then exported into STATA&#8482; Version 14 software for analysis. Descriptive statistics were conducted. Binary logistic regression analyses were used to identify factors. Factors were selected with the entry method. Adjusted odds ratios (AORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to assess the associations between variables and knowledge, attitude and practices (KAP). RESULTS: From a total of 546 included participants, more than half of them, 307 (57%) were males. Seventy-three percent of them heard about novel coronavirus from social media. In this study, 73.8% of the participants were knowledgeable, and their overall attitude was favorable. Approximately 71.4% correctly responded that the main clinical symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, fatigue, dry cough, and shortness of breath. Nearly half, 229 (42%) of the students approved that they had no concern of being infected with COVID-19. Moreover, most participants showed poor practices; more than half of the study subjects were not maintaining a physical distance. In multivariable analyses, people older than 25 years (AOR = 1.6, 95% CI; 1.2, 4.6) and those who lived in urban areas (AOR = 4.3, 95% CI; 2.6, 15.8) were significantly more knowledgeable about COVID-19. Furthermore, those students that have information about COVID-19 (AOR = 2.3, 95% CI; 1.6, 8.7) was significantly associated with the attitude undergraduate students had about COVID-19 as compared with its counterpart. CONCLUSION: The undergraduate students at Debre Berhan University were moderately knowledgeable about COVID-19 and had an optimistic attitude towards its resolution. However, this optimism may lead to poor public health practices within this community. Therefore, greater efforts need to be made through more comprehensive and directed actions and awareness campaigns to increase the knowledge, attitude and practice of the students.","Aynalem, Yared Asmare; Akalu, Tadess Yirga; Gebresellassie Gebregiorgis, Birhan; Sharew, Nigussie Tadesse; Assefa, Hilina Ketema; Shiferaw, Wondimeneh Shibabaw",PLoS One,425,16

However, the utility of medical chart writing simulations as a component of the objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) has not been sufficiently evaluated. In this study, medical chart documentation in several clinical simulation settings was performed as part of the OSCE, and its correlation with CC performance was evaluated. METHODS: We created a clinical situation video and images involving the acquisition of informed consent, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and diagnostic imaging in the emergency department, and assessed medical chart documentation performance by medical students as part of the OSCE. Evaluations were conducted utilizing original checklist (0-10 point). We also analyzed the correlation between medical chart documentation OSCE scores and CC performance of 120 medical students who performed their CC in 2019 as 5th year students and took the Post-CC OSCE in 2020 as 6th year students. RESULTS: Of the OSCE components, scores for the acquisition of informed consent and resuscitation showed significant correlations with CC performance (P<0.001 for each). In contrast, scores for diagnostic imaging showed a slightly positive, but non-significant, correlation with CC performance (P = 0.107). Overall scores for OSCE showed a significant correlation with CC performance (P<0.001). CONCLUSION: We conducted a correlation analysis of CC performance and the quality of medical chart documentation in a simulation setting. Our results suggest that medical chart documentation can be one possible alternative component in the OSCE.","Komasawa, Nobuyasu; Terasaki, Fumio; Nakano, Takashi; Kawata, Ryo",PLoS One,425,26

METHOD: This cross-sectional study was performed using a self-administered online survey, covering parents' and their children's characteristics, parents' willingness and attitudes towards the COVID-19 vaccine. A total of 1035 parents participated. RESULTS: Analysis showed that 36.3% of parents were willing to have their children receive the COVID-19 vaccine and that 59.9% were willing to receive it themselves. In addition, 83.9% were willing to have their children vaccinated with the COVID-19 vaccine if the mortality rates associated with COVID-19 in children increased following a mutation. After adjusting for significant variables, willingness to receive the COVID-19 vaccine (AOR = 24.91; 95% CI = 10.93-56.76), willingness for their children to participate in a COVID-19 vaccine trial (AOR = 11â.87; 95% CI = 2.41-58.40] and advising others to receive the COVID-19 vaccine [AOR = 7.82; 95% CI = 2.50-24.49] were associated with greater parents' willingness for their children to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: Parents' willingness for their children to receive the COVID-19 vaccine was low. The only characteristics of either parents or children found to affect the parents' willingness for children to receive the COVID-19 vaccine was the parents being healthcare workers. Parents' willingness and positive attitudes towards the COVID-19 vaccine are factors that increase acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine for their children.","Yilmaz, Meltem; Sahin, Mustafa Kursat",Int J Clin Pract,425,22

A total of 244 COVID-19 patients were recruited from three local hospitals. All the patients were assigned to mild, common and severe types. Semi-quantitative assessment methods, e.g., lobar-, segmental-based CT scores and opacity-weighted score, and quantitative assessment method, i.e., lesion volume quantification, were applied to quantify the lung lesions. All four assessment methods had high inter-rater agreements. At the group level, the lesion load in severe type patients was consistently observed to be significantly higher than that in common type in the applications of four assessment methods (all the p < 0.001). In discriminating severe from common patients at the individual level, results for lobe-based, segment-based and opacity-weighted assessments had high true positives while the quantitative lesion volume had high true negatives. In conclusion, both semi-quantitative and quantitative methods have excellent repeatability in measuring inflammatory lesions, and can well distinguish between common type and severe type patients. Lobe-based CT score is fast, readily clinically available, and has a high sensitivity in identifying severe type patients. It is suggested to be a prioritized method for assessing the burden of lung lesions in COVID-19 patients.","Guan, Xiaojun; Yao, Liding; Tan, Yanbin; Shen, Zhujing; Zheng, Hanpeng; Zhou, Haisheng; Gao, Yuantong; Li, Yongchou; Ji, Wenbin; Zhang, Huangqi; Wang, Jun; Zhang, Minming; Xu, Xiaojun",Sci Rep,425,16

The survey was designed to determine the impact of the pandemic at two specific time points: June and October 2020, and compare them to the previously collected data. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A web-based questionnaire, in the same format as the April 2020 survey was disseminated to nuclear medicine facilities worldwide. Survey data was collected using a secure software platform hosted by the IAEA; it was made available for 6 weeks, from November 23 to December 31, 2020. RESULTS: From 505 replies received from 96 countries, data was extracted from 355 questionnaires (of which 338 were fully completed). The responses came from centres across varying regions of the world and with heterogeneous income distributions. Regional differences and challenges across the world were identified and analysed. Globally, the volume of nuclear medicine procedures decreased by 73.3% in June 2020 and 56.9% in October 2020. Among the nuclear medicine procedures, oncological PET studies showed less of a decline in utilization compared to conventional nuclear medicine, particularly nuclear cardiology. The negative impact was also significantly less pronounced in high-income countries. A trend towards a gradual return to the pre-COVID-19 situation of the supply chains of radioisotopes, generators, and other essential materials was evident. CONCLUSION: The year 2020 has a significant decrease in nuclear medicine diagnostic and therapeutic procedures as a result of the pandemic-related challenges. In June, the global decline recorded in the survey was greater than in October when the situation began to show improvement. However, the total number of procedures remained below those recorded in April 2020 and fell to less than half of the volumes normally carried out pre-pandemic.","Giammarile, Francesco; Delgado Bolton, Roberto C; El-Haj, Noura; Freudenberg, Lutz S; Herrmann, Ken; Mikhail, Miriam; Morozova, Olga; Orellana, Pilar; Pellet, Olivier; Estrada L, Enrique; Vinjamuri, Sobhan; Gnanasegaran, Gopinath; Pynda, Yaroslav; Navarro-Marulanda, Maria C; Choudhury, Partha S; Paez, Diana",Eur. j. nucl. med. mol. imaging,425,16

Covid-19 has already changed the world economic structure, people's religious, political, social life, public health structure, people's daily life structure and also made millions of people jobless. The only way to fight this epidemic is to identify the infected person as soon as possible and separate them from a healthy person, so that they can't infect anyone again. At present, RT-PCR is currently used to detect coronavirus patients around the world. But the World Health Organization (WHO) said that RT-PCR suffers from low sensitivity and low specificity for early-stage cases. Recent research has shown that chest CT scan images play a beneficial role in identifying coronavirus cases.

METHODS: We evaluated the quantitative serologic antibody response following administration of either a single dose or both doses of an mRNA severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine in a cohort of 98 participants (88 healthcare workers [HCW] and 10 solid organ transplant [SOT] recipients). Antibody levels were compared across 3 immunoassays: Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S (Roche Diagnostics), SARS-CoV-2 TrimericS IgG (DiaSorin), and SARS-CoV-2 IgG II Quant (Abbott). RESULTS: Among HCW, sensitivity ranged from 100% (Roche), 99% (Abbott) and 98% (DiaSorin). The SARS-CoV-2 IgG II Quant and SARS-CoV-2 TrimericS IgG assays showed good agreement with a Pearson correlation coefficient of R = 0.95. Pearson correlation coefficients of R = 0.82 and 0.83 were obtained for Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S vs SARS-CoV-2 TrimericS IgG and SARS-CoV-2 IgG II Quant vs Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S, respectively. Significant differences in antibody levels between HCW and SOT recipients were observed. A decrease in antibody levels from time of vaccine administration to blood draw was evident. Among those with a second dose, an increase in antibody levels with increased time between administration of the first and second dose was observed. CONCLUSIONS: The absolute values generated from each of the assay platforms are not interchangeable. Antibody levels differed with increased time between vaccine administration and with increased time between administration of the first and second dose. Further, significant differences in antibody levels between HCW and SOT recipients were observed.","Di Meo, Ashley; Miller, Jessica J; Fabros, Anselmo; Brinc, Davor; Hall, Victoria; Pinzon, Natalia; Ierullo, Matthew; Ku, Terrance; Ferreira, Victor H; Kumar, Deepali; Pasic, Maria D; Kulasingam, Vathany",J Appl Lab Med,425,20

However, sensitivities of tests in routine use are unsatisfactory, due to the characteristically low parasitaemias in naturally infected individuals. We have identified a conserved sequence in the repetitive insertion mobile element (RIME) of the sub-genus Trypanozoon and used it to design primers for a highly specific loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) test. The test was used to analyse Trypanozoon isolates and clinical samples from HAT patients. The RIME LAMP assay was performed at 62 °C using real-time PCR and a water bath. DNA amplification was detectable within 25 min. All positive samples detected by gel electrophoresis or in real-time using SYTO-9 fluorescence dye could also be detected visually by addition of SYBR Green I to the product. The amplicon was unequivocally confirmed through restriction enzyme NdeI digestion, analysis of melt curves and sequencing. The analytical sensitivity of the RIME LAMP assay was equivalent to 0.001 trypanosomes/ml while that of classical PCR tests ranged from 0.1 to 1000 trypanosomes/ml. LAMP detected all 75 Trypanozoon isolates while TBR1 and two primers (specific for sub-genus Trypanozoon) showed a sensitivity of 86.9%. The SRA gene PCR detected 21 out of 40 Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense isolates while Trypanosoma gambiense-specific glycoprotein primers (TgsGP) detected 11 out of 13 T. b. gambiense isolates. Using clinical samples, the LAMP test detected parasite DNA in 18 out of 20 samples which included using supernatant prepared from boiled blood, CSF and direct native serum. The sensitivity and reproducibility of the LAMP assay coupled with the ability to detect the results visually without the need for sophisticated equipment indicate that the technique has strong potential for detection of HAT in clinical settings. Since the LAMP test shows a high tolerance to different biological substances, determination of the appropriate protocols for processing the template to make it a user-friendly technique, prior to large scale evaluation, is needed.","Njiru, Z.K.; Mikosza, A.S.J.; Matovu, E.; Enyaru, J.C.K.; Ouma, J.O.; Kibona, S.N.; Thompson, R.C.A.; Ndung’u, J.M.",Int J Parasitol,425,8

Using this functional form, we perform a data collapse across countries and US states with very different population characteristics and social distancing policies, confirming the universal behavior of the COVID-19 outbreak. We show that the predictive power of statistical models is limited until a few days before curves flatten, forecast deaths and infections assuming current policies continue and compare our predictions to the IHME models.

METHODS: Comprehensive literature searches were executed in MEDLINE, Embase and the Cochrane library. The grey literature was searched via international clinical trial registries for relevant studies published in English in the last 20 years. We included studies in healthy humans of any age that used any dose-sparing strategy to administer intramuscular seasonal influenza vaccines. Title/abstract and full-text screening were carried out by pairs of reviewers independently. Data extraction was conducted by a single reviewer and verified by a second reviewer. Our outcomes were influenza infections, intensive care unit admission, pneumonia, hospitalisations, adverse events and mortality. Results were summarised descriptively. RESULTS: A total of 13 studies with 10 351 participants were included in the review and all studies were randomised controlled trials (RCTs) conducted between 2006 and 2019. The most common interventions were the trivalent influenza vaccine (n=10), followed by the quadrivalent influenza vaccine (n=4). Nine studies included infants/toddlers 6–36 months old and one of these studies also included children and adolescents. In these nine studies, no clinical effectiveness outcomes were reported. Of the four adult studies (≥18 years), two studies reported on effectiveness outcomes, however, only one RCT reported on laboratory-confirmed influenza. CONCLUSIONS: Due to the low number of studies in healthy adults and the lack of studies assessing confirmed influenza and influenza-like illness, there remains a need for further evaluation.","Lunny, Carole; Antony, Jesmin; Rios, Patricia; Williams, Chantal; Ramkissoon, Naveeta; Straus, Sharon E; Tricco, Andrea C",BMJ Open,425,8

Engl J Med 2020a;382:1199–207, Nature 2020;579:270–3). SARS-CoV-2 surveillance is essential to controlling widespread transmission. However, there are several challenges associated with the diagnostic of the COVID-19 during the current outbreak (Liu and Li (2019), Nature 2020;579:265–9, N. Engl J Med 2020;382:727–33). Firstly, the high number of cases overwhelms diagnostic test capacity and proposes the need for a rapid solution for sample processing (Science 2018;360:444–8). Secondly, SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to other important coronavirus species and subspecies, so detection assays can give false-positive results if they are not efficiently specific to SARS-CoV-2. Thirdly, patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection sometimes have a different respiratory viral infection or co-infections with SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses (MedRxiv 2020a;1–18). Confirmation of the COVID-19 is performed mainly by virus isolation followed by RT-PCR and sequencing (N. Engl J Med 2020;382:727–33, MedRxiv 2020a, Turkish J Biol 2020;44:192–202).

However, we lack empirical data about the associations among disorder, mood state, behavioral activation system (BAS) sensitivity, and psychosocial functioning level. Thus, the present study aimed to identify the role of coping flexibility with BAS activating stimuli in relation to mood states among a sample of individuals with BD (n = 90) and a healthy control group (n = 90). Through multiple regressions, the moderating role of coping flexibility was determined. Findings showed that coping flexibility had an additional value in predicting mood states beyond BAS sensitivity and psychosocial functioning level. Specifically, perceived controllability was considerably important for the BD group, whereas fit index was crucial in the controls. In addition, a moderation analysis showed that perceived controllability alleviated the effects of BD diagnosis, BAS sensitivity, and psychosocial functioning level on mood states. Theoretically, this study helps integrate the concept of coping flexibility into the BAS dysregulation theory as it applies to BD. The practical implication for enhancing mindfulness practice is also discussed.","Chan, Sunny H.W.; Tse, Samson",Psychiatry Res,425,29

Circulating unconventional T cells of COVID-19 patients presented with a profound and persistent phenotypic alteration. In the airways, highly activated unconventional T cells were detected, suggesting a potential contribution in the regulation of local inflammation. Finally, expression of the CD69 activation marker on blood iNKT and MAIT cells of COVID-19 patients on admission was predictive of clinical course and disease severity.

We stratified patients into clinically relevant responders (>250 IU/mL), partial responders (50–250 IU/mL, which was above pre-COVID-19 background), and nonresponders (<50 IU/mL). Smoldering MM patients responded better than those with active disease. Only 45% of active MM patients developed an adequate response, while 22% had a partial response. Lower spike antibody levels were associated with older age, impaired renal function, low lymphocyte counts, reduced uninvolved immunoglobulin levels, > second line of treatment, and among those not in complete remission. Patients who received mRNA-1273 vaccine had higher anti-spike antibody levels than those who were vaccinated with BNT162b2.

Health care personnel (HCP), first responders, and other essential and frontline workers (OEWs) are at increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection because of frequent close contact with others. OBJECTIVE: The Arizona Healthcare, Emergency Response, and Other Essential Workers Study (AZ HEROES) aims to examine the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 illness among adults with high occupational exposure risk. Study objectives include estimating the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in essential workers by symptom presentation and demographic factors, determining independent effects of occupational and community exposures on incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, establishing molecular and immunologic characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infection in essential workers, describing the duration and patterns of real-time reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) positivity, and examining postvaccine immunologic response. METHODS: Eligible participants include Arizona residents aged 18 to 85 years who work at least 20 hours per week in an occupation involving regular direct contact (ie, within 3 feet) with others. Recruitment goals are stratified by demographic characteristics (50% aged 40 years or older, 50% women, and 50% Hispanic or American Indian), by occupation (40% HCP, 30% first responders, and 30% OEWs), and by prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (with up to 50% seropositive at baseline). Information on sociodemographics, health and medical history, vaccination status, exposures to individuals with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, use of personal protective equipment, and perceived risks are collected at enrollment and updated through quarterly surveys. Every week, participants complete active surveillance for COVID-like illness (CLI) and self-collect nasal swabs. Additional self-collected nasal swab and saliva specimens are collected in the event of CLI onset. Respiratory specimens are sent to Marshfield Laboratories and tested for SARS-CoV-2 by rRT-PCR assay. CLI symptoms and impact on work and productivity are followed through illness resolution. Serum specimens are collected every 3 months and additional sera are collected following incident rRT-PCR positivity and after each COVID-19 vaccine dose. Incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections will be calculated by person-weeks at risk and compared by occupation and demographic characteristics as well as by seropositivity status and infection and vaccination history. RESULTS: The AZ HEROES study was funded by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Enrollment began on July 27, 2020; as of May 1, 2021, a total of 3165 participants have been enrolled in the study. Enrollment is expected to continue through December 1, 2021, with data collection continuing through at least April 2022, contingent upon funding. CONCLUSIONS: AZ HEROES is unique in aiming to recruit a diverse sample of essential workers and to prospectively follow strata of SARS-CoV-2 seronegative and seropositive adults.

DESIGN: Stepped-wedge cluster randomised trial (unblinded), randomised at hospital-level. SETTING: 12 hospitals in south-west Nigeria. PARTICIPANTS: 7,141 children (aged 28 days to 14 years) admitted with severe pneumonia, severe malaria or diarrhoea with severe dehydration between January 2014 and October 2017. INTERVENTIONS: Phase 1 (pulse oximetry) introduced pulse oximetry for all admitted children. Phase 2 (full oxygen system) (i) standardised oxygen equipment package, (ii) clinical education and support, (iii) technical training and support, and (iv) infrastructure and systems support. OUTCOME MEASURES: We used quantitative QOC scores evaluating assessment, diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring practices against World Health Organization and Nigerian standards. We evaluated mean differences in QOC scores between study periods (baseline, oximetry, full oxygen system), using mixed-effects linear regression. RESULTS: 7,141 eligible participants; 6,893 (96.5%) had adequate data for analysis. Mean paediatric QOC score (maximum 6) increased from 1.64 to 3.00 (adjusted mean difference 1.39; 95% CI 1.08–1.69, p<0.001) for severe pneumonia and 2.81 to 4.04 (aMD 1.53; 95% CI 1.23–1.83, p<0.001) for severe malaria, comparing the full intervention to baseline, but did not change for diarrhoea with severe dehydration (aMD -0.12; 95% CI -0.46–0.23, p = 0.501). After excluding practices directly related to pulse oximetry and oxygen, we found aMD 0.23 for severe pneumonia (95% CI -0.02–0.48, p = 0.072) and 0.65 for severe malaria (95% CI 0.41–0.89, p<0.001) comparing full intervention to baseline. Sub-analysis showed some improvements (and no deterioration) in care processes not directly related to oxygen or pulse oximetry. CONCLUSION: Improvements in hospital oxygen systems were associated with higher QOC scores, attributable to better use of pulse oximetry and oxygen as well as broader improvements in clinical care, with no negative distortions in care practices.

METHODS: We performed a literature search using the term “distributed learning” OR “federated learning” in the PubMed/MEDLINE and EMBASE databases. No start date limit was used, and the search was extended until July 21, 2020. We excluded articles outside the field of interest; guidelines or expert opinion, review articles and meta-analyses, editorials, letters or commentaries, and conference abstracts; articles not in the English language; and studies not using medical data. Selected studies were classified and analysed according to their aim(s). RESULTS: We included 26 papers aimed at predicting one or more outcomes: namely risk, diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment side effect/adverse drug reaction. Distributed learning was compared to centralized or localized training in 21/26 and 14/26 selected papers, respectively. Regardless of the aim, the type of input, the method, and the classifier, distributed learning performed close to centralized training, but two experiments focused on diagnosis. In all but 2 cases, distributed learning outperformed locally trained models. CONCLUSION: Distributed learning resulted in a reliable strategy for model development; indeed, it performed equally to models trained on centralized datasets. Sensitive data can get preserved since they are not shared for model development. Distributed learning constitutes a promising solution for ML-based research and practice since large, diverse datasets are crucial for success.","Kirienko, Margarita; Sollini, Martina; Ninatti, Gaia; Loiacono, Daniele; Giacomello, Edoardo; Gozzi, Noemi; Amigoni, Francesco; Mainardi, Luca; Lanzi, Pier Luca; Chiti, Arturo",Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging,425,24

The viral trans-activator of transcription (Tat) protein uses an archetypal arginine-rich motif (ARM) to recruit the host positive transcription elongation factor b (pTEFb) complex onto the viral trans-activation response (TAR) RNA, leading to activation of HIV transcription. Efforts to block this interaction have stimulated production of biologics designed to disrupt this essential RNA-protein interface. Here, we present four co-crystal structures of lab-evolved TAR-binding proteins (TBPs) in complex with HIV-1 TAR. Our results reveal that high-affinity binding requires a distinct sequence and spacing of arginines within a specific β2-β3 hairpin loop that arose during selection. Although loops with as many as five arginines were analyzed, only three arginines could bind simultaneously with major-groove guanines. Amino acids that promote backbone interactions within the β2-β3 loop were also observed to be important for high-affinity interactions. Based on structural and affinity analyses, we designed two cyclic peptide mimics of the TAR-binding β2-β3 loop sequences present in two high-affinity TBPs (K(D) values of 4.2 ± 0.3 and 3.0 ± 0.3 nm). Our efforts yielded low-molecular weight compounds that bind TAR with low micromolar affinity (K(D) values ranging from 3.6 to 22 μm). Significantly, one cyclic compound within this series blocked binding of the Tat-ARM peptide to TAR in solution assays, whereas its linear counterpart did not. Overall, this work provides insight into protein-mediated TAR recognition and lays the ground for the development of cyclic peptide inhibitors of a vital HIV-1 RNA-protein interaction.","Chavali, Sai Shashank; Mali, Sachitanand M.; Jenkins, Jermaine L.; Fasan, Rudi; Wedekind, Joseph E.",J Biol Chem,425,21

This study investigated risk perception of influenza and the role of sociodemographic and psychological variables on perceived risk. Participants were 442 adults. The research was conducted using three measures: an adjustment of the “Risk Perception of Infectious Disease Questionnaire,” the “General Self-Efficacy Scale,” and the short form of the “Italian Personality Inventory.” The results showed that age, education, self-efficacy, and personality influenced risk perception. The evidence that sociodemographic and psychological factors contribute to risk perception of a disease shows the need to take into account these variables in the planning of informative campaigns, with the aim to achieve favorable changes in public behavior.

The hydatidiform mole is the most common form of GTD, representing 80 % of cases. An invasive mole is a hydatidiform mole characterized by the enlarged hydropic villi invading into the myometrium, into vascular spaces, or into extrauterine sites. CASE PRESENTATION: Here is a case with invasive mole after the evacuation of complete molar pregnancy, presented with an acute abdomen. We desired to preserve the uterine because our 21 years old patient doesn't have a child. CLINICAL DISCUSSION: An emergency abdominal ultrasound scan showed a 47 ∗ 34 ∗ 55 mm ill-defined hyperechoic heterogeneous mass with anechoic cystic vascular spaces within it, in the posterior wall of the uterus away from the endometrium that extended to the serous layer of the uterus. Laparotomy was done. After the evacuation of 2 L of hemoperitoneum, an approximately 5 × 4 metastatic, vesicular mass was seen in the posterior wall of the uterus, which was resected and uterine preservation was successful. CONCLUSION: This case report describes the clinical, imaging, surgical and histopathological findings of Invasive mole after a hydatidiform molar pregnancy. Our case highlights the feasibility of fertility-preserving surgery in the case who experienced life-threatening hemorrhage due to a ruptured uterus.","Zamani, Mehrangiz; Alizadeh, Shima; Mollabashi, Mina",Int J Surg Case Rep,425,16

(Fellows Voice),19.369064,3.8694065,2021-08-08,"Many of the world’s most pressing issues, such as the emergence of zoonotic diseases, can only be addressed through interdisciplinary research. However, the findings of interdisciplinary research are susceptible to miscommunication among both professional and non-professional audiences due to differences in training, language, experience, and understanding. Such miscommunication contributes to the misunderstanding of key concepts or processes and hinders the development of effective research agendas and public policy. These misunderstandings can also provoke unnecessary fear in the public and have devastating effects for wildlife conservation. For example, inaccurate communication and subsequent misunderstanding of the potential associations between certain bats and zoonoses has led to persecution of diverse bats worldwide and even government calls to cull them. Here, we identify four types of miscommunication driven by the use of terminology regarding bats and the emergence of zoonotic diseases that we have categorized based on their root causes: (1) incorrect or overly broad use of terms; (2) terms that have unstable usage within a discipline, or different usages among disciplines; (3) terms that are used correctly but spark incorrect inferences about biological processes or significance in the audience; (4) incorrect inference drawn from the evidence presented. We illustrate each type of miscommunication with commonly misused or misinterpreted terms, providing a definition, caveats and common misconceptions, and suggest alternatives as appropriate. While we focus on terms specific to bats and disease ecology, we present a more general framework for addressing miscommunication that can be applied to other topics and disciplines to facilitate more effective research, problem-solving, and public policy.","Shapiro, Julie Teresa; Víquez-R, Luis; Leopardi, Stefania; Vicente-Santos, Amanda; Mendenhall, Ian H.; Frick, Winifred F.; Kading, Rebekah C.; Medellín, Rodrigo A.; Racey, Paul; Kingston, Tigga",Viruses,425,17

Like most members of this family, the virus is composed of structural and non-structural proteins (NSPs). The non-structural proteins are critical elements of the replication and transcription complex (RTC), as well as immune system evasion. Through hijacking the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, NSPs help the virus establish the RTC, inducing ER stress after membrane rearrangement and causing severe neuronal disturbance. In this review, we focus on the role of Nsp3, 4, and 6 in intracellular membrane rearrangement and evaluate the potential disruption of the central nervous system and the neurodegeneration which it could trigger. Studies of these NSPs will not only bring to light their specific role in viral infection but also facilitate the discovery of novel targeted drugs.","Santerre, Maryline; Arjona, Sterling P.; Allen, Charles NS; Shcherbik, Natalia; Sawaya, Bassel E.",J Neurol,425,3

STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Tertiary care center. METHODS: Patient satisfaction was rated by patients (age ≥18 years) who had encounters from May to July 2020 (n = 407). Physician satisfaction was rated by 15 otolaryngologists for specific encounters delivered from May to June 2020 (n = 1011). Patient satisfaction was measured with a Press Ganey questionnaire and a Telemedicine Satisfaction Questionnaire. Mean Press Ganey satisfaction scores of telemedicine encounters during COVID-19 were compared with the pre-COVID-19 Press Ganey scores from in-person encounters (n = 3059) to test a noninferiority hypothesis. Physician satisfaction was measured with a Provider Satisfaction Questionnaire. RESULTS: The mean Press Ganey patient satisfaction score for telemedicine encounters was 94.5 (SD, 8.8), no worse than that for in-person encounters prior to COVID-19 at 93.7 (SD, 15.5; Δ = 0.8 [95% CI, -0.5 to 2.1, excluding the noninferiority margin of -1]). Encounters with videoconference (vs telephone) and patients reporting higher income were associated with higher Telemedicine Satisfaction Questionnaire scores. Physician satisfaction scores during COVID-19 with telemedicine encounters were overall high at 83.3 (95% CI, 77.5-89.1), slightly lower when compared with the scores with in-person encounters at 88.4 (95% CI, 82.5-94.3; Δ = -5.2 [95% CI, -6.6 to -3.8]). Encounters with videoconference (vs telephone) and patients with English as a preferred language and follow-up visits were associated with higher Provider Satisfaction Questionnaire scores. CONCLUSIONS: Telemedicine is a feasible alternative format in otolaryngology during COVID-19 with overall high patient and physician satisfaction. Patient satisfaction with telemedicine encounters during COVID-19 was no worse than in-person encounters prior to the pandemic. Physician satisfaction with telemedicine was relatively lower in comparison with in-person encounters.","Choi, Janet S; Kim, James H; Park, Soyun; Lin, Matthew; Abdur-Rahman, Faiz; Mack, Wendy J; Volker, Courtney C J",Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,425,16

Methods We retrospectively analyzed data in the China Lung Transplantation Registration from January 23rd, 2020, to March 23rd, 2020 (2020 cohort), compared to the same period in 2019 (2019 cohort). Pre- and post-lung transplantation (LTx) management strategies, including measures aiming to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection, were applied for all recipients, including five post-COVID-19 transplants during the COVID-19 pandemic period in China. Results Twenty-eight LTx procedures were performed, including LTx for five patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to COVID-19-related pulmonary fibrosis. Compared to the 2019 cohort, more patients with urgent conditions were transplanted in 2020, with a shorter pre-LTx admission time and early mobilization post-LTx. A large proportion (60%) of lung donations were transported on high-speed trains and commercial flights or commercial flights and highways. Grafts in the preservation containers were handed over to the receiving staff at the airport for 40% (10/25) of donations, which reduced the unnecessary quarantine of transporting staff entering the city. Listed candidates were urgently transferred to other qualified centers in 17.9% (5/28) of cases, which reduced the risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure in COVID-19 designated hospitals. The 90-day survival rate of the recipients transplanted in 2020 was 85.7%, including 3 of 5 (60%) recipients who were critically severe COVID-19 patients. Conclusion LTx and lung donation amid COVID-19 can be performed safely with coordinated efforts on medical resource sharing and medical staff protection based on stratification of the infection risk. Outcomes were not compromised during the COVID-19 outbreak. LTx can be regarded as salvage therapy for critical COVID-19 patients with a confirmed positive-turned-negative virology status.","Bo, Wu; Man, Huang; Guohui, Jiao; Chunxiao, Hu; Yi, Yang; Jingyu, Chen",J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg,425,16

PPC available in Hong Kong were sorted by their physical properties in the first stage. The second stage was a single-blinded study examining the different usability aspects of the PPC. The third stage was a simulated viral load test. RESULTS: Four types were identified: good water repellency and water resistance, poor air permeability (Type A PPC); good water repellency and air permeability, poor water resistance (Type B PPC); poor water repellency, poor water resistance, and fair air permeability (Type C PPC); and good water repellency, poor air permeability, and fair water resistance (Type D PPC). Type D PPC had a significantly higher number of contamination sites on the subjects' dorsum and palm. Type C PPC had the highest contamination over the trunk. Findings in the viral load test showed that there was a significant difference in the contamination of the face (t = 4.69, df = 38, P<.00) between 1 and 2 strokes. CONCLUSION: Type A PPC is effective in providing a desirable protective function against droplet splash, if a disposable PPC is required. Type C PPC, the surgical gown, is also appropriate, as the cost is low, air permeability is fair, and the level of possible hand contamination is lowest among the 4 groups in the current study.","Wong, Thomas K.S; Chung, Joanne W.Y; Li, Y; Chan, Wai F; Ching, Patricia T.Y; Lam, Conita H.S; Chow, Chun B; Seto, Wing H",Am J Infect Control,425,24

Textual analysis further showed that the detected bots used simpler and more abusive second-person language, as well as hashtags related to COVID-19 and voter activity—pointing to aggressive tactics potentially fuelling online hostility and questioning the legitimacy of the polls. Finally, bots were associated with larger, less dense, and less echo chamber-like communities, suggesting efforts to participate in larger, mainstream conversations. However, despite their distinct narrative and network maneuvers, bots generally did not hold significant influence throughout the social network. Hence, although intersecting concerns of political conflict during a global pandemic may promptly raise the possibility of online interference, we quantify both the efforts and limits of bot-fueled disinformation in the 2020 Singaporean elections. We conclude with several implications for digital disinformation in times of crisis, in the Asia-Pacific and beyond.","Uyheng, Joshua; Ng, Lynnette Hui Xian; Carley, Kathleen M.",Comput Math Organ Theory,425,16

The current indispensable challenge lies in the development of universal virus repudiation systems that are reusable, and capable of inactivating pathogens, thus reducing risk of infection and transmission. In this review, science-based methods, mechanisms, and procedures, which are implemented in obtaining resultant antiviral coated substrates, used in the destruction of the strains of the different viruses, are reviewed. The constituent antiviral members are classified into a few broad groups, such as polymeric materials, metal ions/metal oxides, and functional nanomaterials, based on the type of materials used at the virus contamination sites. The action mode against enveloped viruses was depicted to vindicate the antiviral mechanism. We also disclose hypothesized strategies for development of a universal and reusable virus deactivation system against the emerging COVID-19. In the surge of the current, alarming scenario of SARS-CoV-2 infections, there is a great necessity for developing highly-innovative antiviral agents to work against the viruses. We hypothesize that some of the antiviral coatings discussed here could exert an inhibitive effect on COVID-19, indicated by the results that the coatings succeeded in obtaining against other enveloped viruses. Consequently, the coatings need to be tested and authenticated, to fabricate a wide range of coated antiviral products such as masks, gowns, surgical drapes, textiles, high-touch surfaces, and other personal protective equipment, aimed at extrication from the COVID-19 pandemic.","Pemmada, Rakesh; Zhu, Xiaoxian; Dash, Madhusmita; Zhou, Yubin; Ramakrishna, Seeram; Peng, Xinsheng; Thomas, Vinoy; Jain, Sanjeev; Nanda, Himansu Sekhar",Materials (Basel),425,20

Agents decide whether to ""go out"" (or self-quarantine) and, if so, whether to wear protection such as masks. Three elements distinguish the model from existing work. First, non-symptomatic agents do not know if they are infected. Second, some of these agents unknowingly transmit infections. Third, we permit two-sided prevention via the use of non-pharmaceutical interventions: the probability of a person catching the virus from another depends on protection choices made by each. We find that a mean-preserving increase in pre-existing income inequality unambiguously increases the equilibrium proportion of unprotected, socializing agents and may increase or decrease the proportion who self-quarantine. Strikingly, while higher pre-COVID inequality may or may not raise the overall risk of infection, it increases the risk of disease in social interactions.","Bhattacharya, Joydeep; Chakraborty, Shankha; Yu, Xiumei",,425,20

The aims of this study were to analyse the mental health and health‐related quality of life (HRQoL) of a broad sample of CHWs in Spain and to identify potential factors that have a significant effect on their mental health and HRQoL. METHOD: This descriptive study comprised 210 CHWs who completed the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7‐item Scale, the Patient Health Questionnaire‐9, the Impact Event Scale‐Revised, the Insomnia Severity Index, and the Health‐related Quality of Life Questionnaire. Sociodemographic and clinical data in relation to COVID‐19 were also recorded. Descriptive statistics, univariable analysis and multivariable linear regression models were applied to identify factors associated with mental health and HRQoL. RESULTS: Of total, 86.19% of participants were female; 86.67% were aged under 55 years; 11% were physicians and 64.19% were nurses or auxiliaries; 77.62% have themselves tested positive for Covid‐19; and 67.94% of CHWs have directly treated patients with Covid‐19. 49.28% had clinical depression; over half (58.57%) had clinical anxiety; 70.95% had clinical stress; and 28.57% had clinical insomnia. Increased use of tranquilizers/sedatives appears to be an explanatory variable of suffering greater anxiety, depression, stress and insomnia, and of having a worse HRQoL amongst our CHWs. CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms that symptomatology of anxiety, depression, stress, insomnia and HRQoL were affected amongst CHWs during the Covid‐19 pandemic.","Martín, Josune; Padierna, Ángel; Villanueva, Ane; Quintana, José M.",Int J Geriatr Psychiatry,425,1

METHODS: This study retrospectively investigated 1407 HCWs who were screened for COVID-19 by chest computed tomography (CT) scans and nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid. Demographics, CT features, nasopharyngeal swabs, baseline symptoms, and laboratory data were collected. RESULTS: Of 1407 HCWs, 235 had symptoms and 1172 were asymptomatic close contacts, of which, 107 were symptomatic cases and 84 were close contacts who had abnormal CT findings. Of 152 symptomatic individuals and 908 close contacts tested for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid, 122 symptomatic cases and 38 close contacts had positive reverse-transcriptase real-time polymerase chain (RT-PCR) test results. The rate of confirmed asymptomatic infections was 4.2% (38/908). Both symptomatic and asymptomatic infected cases had high titrations of specific IgG or had ≥four-fold increase in IgG during convalescence compared with the acute phase. Combining the RT-PCR tests and serological findings, the rate of asymptomatic infections was 9.7% (88/908). In terms of the duration of viral shedding, there was no significant difference between symptomatic mild/moderate participants and asymptomatic infections. CONCLUSIONS: The findings demonstrated that a high rate of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers existed among healthcare worker close contacts during the outbreak of COVID-19.","Zhao, Dong; Wang, Mengmei; Wang, Ming; Zhao, Yang; Zheng, Zhishui; Li, Xiaochen; Zhang, Yunting; Wang, Tao; Zeng, Shaolin; Hu, Weihua; Yu, Wenzhen; Hu, Ke",Int J Infect Dis,425,1

To analyze the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic in Latin American and Caribbean countries in its first 90 days and its association with variables related to public health measures, and demographic, health and social characteristics. METHODS. he trend in new daily cases and the crude mortality rate (CMR) from COVID-19 were analyzed through the Joinpoint regression analysis methodology, using the Joinpoint Regression Program 4.8.0.1. Data was obtained from the Our World in Data registry. A multiple correspondence analysis was performed between the public health measures adopted in each country to face the COVID-19 pandemic (measured through the stringency index, Oxford University) and sanitary, demographic and social conditions, and the results of the evolution of the pandemic. SPSS software was used. RESULTS. The Joinpoint regression analysis showed that the highest increase in the number of cases was observed in Brazil (11.3%) and the highest increase in CMR in Mexico (16.2%). The multiple correspondence analysis showed that CMR was associated with the total population, the stringency index, the level of urbanization, the proportion of the population living on less than one dollar a day, the prevalence of diabetes and the number of hospital beds. CONCLUSIONS. The countries of the region show a heterogeneous evolution in the incidence of COVID-19. This heterogeneity is associated with both the public health measures adopted, as well as with the population size, poverty levels and pre-existing health systems.","Acosta, Laura Débora",Rev Panam Salud Publica,425,1

Though spatially concentrated ethnic minority colocations could improve business outcomes in the non-crisis period, with the pandemic affecting all the members in the enclave, the very dependencies in minority enclaves could be a liability.

Although there are many efficient antiviral agents, they still have drawbacks such as development of virus resistance and accumulation within off-target organs. Encapsulation of antiviral agents into nanoparticles (NPs) has been shown to improve bioavailability, control release, and reduce side effects. However, there is little quantitative understanding of how the uptake of NPs into virally infected cells compares to uninfected cells. In this work, the uptake of fluorescently labeled polymer NPs was investigated in several models of rhinovirus (RV) infected cells. Different multiplicities of RV infections (MOI) and timings of NPs uptake were also investigated. In some cases, RV infection resulted in a significant increase of NPs uptake, but this was not universally noted. For HeLa cells, RV-A16 and RV-A01 infection elevated NPs uptake upon increasing the incubation time, whereas at later timepoints (6 h) a reduced uptake was noted with RV-A01 infection (owing to decreased cell viability). Beas-2B cells exhibited more complex trends: decreases in NPs uptake (cf. uninfected cells) were observed at short incubation times following RV-A01 and RV-A16 infection. At later incubation times (4 h), we found a marked decrease of NPs uptake for RV-A01 infected cells but an increase in uptake with RV-A16 infected cells. Where increases in NPs uptake were found, they were very modest compared to results previously reported for a hepatitis C/ Huh7.5 cell line model. An increase in RV dose (MOI) was not associated with any notable change of NPs uptake. We argue that the diverse endocytic pathways among the different cell lines, together with changes in virus nature, size, and entry mechanism are responsible for these differences. These findings suggest that NPs entry into virally infected cells is a complex process, and further work is required to unravel the different factors which govern this. Undertaking this additional research will be crucial to develop potent nanomedicines for the delivery of antiviral agents.","Abo-zeid, Yasmin; Williams, Gareth R.; Touabi, Lila; McLean, Gary R.",Int J Pharm,425,16

Lifestyle indexes included traditional and emerging lifestyle risk factors based on health guidelines and best practice recommendations for: physical activity, sedentary behaviour, sleep quality, diet quality, alcohol consumption, and smoking status. The main outcome was mortality from infectious diseases, including pneumonia, and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Meeting public health guidelines or best practice recommendations among combinations of lifestyle risk factors was inversely associated with mortality. Hazard ratios ranged between 0.26 (0.23-0.30) to 0.69 (0.60-0.79) for infectious disease and pneumonia. Among participants with pre-existing cardiovascular disease or cancer, hazard ratios ranged between 0.30 (0.25-0.34) to 0.73 (0.60-0.89). COVID-19 mortality risk ranged between 0.42 (0.28-0.63) to 0.75 (0.49-1.13). We found a beneficial dose-response association with a higher lifestyle index against mortality that was consistent across sex, age, BMI, and socioeconomic status. There was limited evidence of synergistic interactions between most lifestyle behaviour pairs, suggesting that the dose-response relationship among different lifestyle behaviours is not greater than the sum of the risk induced by each behaviour. Improvements in lifestyle risk factors and meeting public health guidelines or best practice recommendations could be used as an ancillary measure to ameliorate infectious disease mortality.","Ahmadi, Matthew N.; Huang, Bo-Huei; Inan-Eroglu, Elif; Hamer, Mark; Stamatakis, Emmanuel",Brain Behav Immun,425,11

COL − had fewer red blood cells (RBC) (6.5 ± 0.8 × 10(6)/μL) and less hemoglobin (Hgb) (8.3 ± 1.4 g/dL) than COL + (RBC = 7.2 ± 0.8 × 10(6)/μL; Hgb = 9.6 ± 1.3 g/dL) at D14 (P ≤ 0.05). COL − had more anemia on D21 (P = 0.03) and on D28 (P = 0.02). Iron was lower in COL − (5.6 ± 2.7 μM/L) than COL + (10.7 ± 6.2 μM/L) (P = 0.03) on D7. Lymphocytes was lower in COL − than COL + on D7 (3.8 ± 1.0 × 10(3)/μL COL + and 5.4 ± 2.2 × 10(3)/μL COL −, P = 0.02). COL − calves had more anemia and lower serum iron concomitant with diarrhea on D7. The number of leukocytes was relatively consistent in the COL + calves, while COL − calves showed an increasing number of of lymphocytes starting on D7.","Novo, Sylvia Marquart Fontes; Costa, Juliana Fraça dos Reis; Baccili, Camila Costa; Sobreira, Natália Meirelles; Silva, Bruno Toledo; de Oliveira, Pamella Lorenci; Hurley, David John; Gomes, Viviani",Res Vet Sci,425,12

Researchers for this study interviewed 39 parents whose children participated in a three-week structured kindergarten transition program designed to promote parental involvement in school, reduce students’ chronic absenteeism, and increase children’s readiness for kindergarten. All interviewees expressed that participating in the program yielded benefits for themselves and their children. Respondents shared that meeting education staff members early during the summer, familiarizing themselves with the layout and routines of their schools, and building stronger social connections with other families were of particular value in helping them prepare for the start of kindergarten. Similarly, understanding kindergarten expectations more thoroughly and acquiring tools to support their children at home were deemed especially beneficial for those families who had not previously participated in preschool or other structured school opportunities. In addition to positive feedback, participants proposed various ways that adjusting the program could better meet the needs of all stakeholders. Suggestions included increasing the length of the student sessions, improving communication between district and families, re-structuring the parent information sessions to be more conducive to working families, and staffing the program with more individuals who would stay on as teachers during the transition from summer to fall. Parent suggestions from this study were synthesized into multiple implications for practice and substantiated by current relevant literature.","Merideth, Christopher; Cavanaugh, Beth; Romas, Sue; Ralston, Nicole; Arias, Eva; Tarasawa, Beth; Waggoner, Jacqueline",Early Child Educ J,425,16

Cannabidiol (CBD) has anxiolytic and antidepressant properties and may be capable of reducing emotional exhaustion and burnout symptoms. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the safety and efficacy of CBD therapy for the reduction of emotional exhaustion and burnout symptoms among frontline health care professionals working with patients with COVID-19. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This prospective open-label single-site randomized clinical trial used a 1:1 block randomization design to examine emotional exhaustion and burnout symptoms among frontline health care professionals (physicians, nurses, and physical therapists) working with patients with COVID-19 at the Ribeirão Preto Medical School University Hospital in São Paulo, Brazil. Participants were enrolled between June 12 and November 12, 2020. A total of 214 health care professionals were recruited and assessed for eligibility, and 120 participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio by a researcher who was not directly involved with data collection. INTERVENTIONS: Cannabidiol, 300 mg (150 mg twice per day), plus standard care or standard care alone for 28 days. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was emotional exhaustion and burnout symptoms, which were assessed for 28 days using the emotional exhaustion subscale of the Brazilian version of the Maslach Burnout Inventory–Human Services Survey for Medical Personnel. RESULTS: A total of 120 participants were randomized to receive either CBD, 300 mg, plus standard care (treatment arm; n = 61) or standard care alone (control arm; n = 59) for 28 days. Of those, 118 participants (59 participants in each arm; 79 women [66.9%]; mean age, 33.6 years [95% CI, 32.3-34.9 years]) received the intervention and were included in the efficacy analysis. In the treatment arm, scores on the emotional exhaustion subscale of the Maslach Burnout Inventory significantly decreased at day 14 (mean difference, 4.14 points; 95% CI, 1.47-6.80 points; partial eta squared [η(p)(2)] = 0.08), day 21 (mean difference, 4.34 points; 95% CI, 0.94-7.73 points; η(p)(2) = 0.05), and day 28 (mean difference, 4.01 points; 95% CI, 0.43-7.59 points; η(p)(2) = 0.04). However, 5 participants, all of whom were in the treatment group, experienced serious adverse events: 4 cases of elevated liver enzymes (1 critical and 3 mild, with the mild elevations reported at the final 28-day assessment) and 1 case of severe pharmacodermia. In 2 of those cases (1 with critical elevation of liver enzymes and 1 with severe pharmacodermia), CBD therapy was discontinued, and the participants had a full recovery. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, CBD therapy reduced symptoms of burnout and emotional exhaustion among health care professionals working with patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, it is necessary to balance the benefits of CBD therapy with potential undesired or adverse effects. Future double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trials are needed to confirm the present findings.

Our model of city-level transmission of an infectious agent (SEIR model) characterises spread via a (a) scale-free contact network (no control); (b) a random graph (elimination of mass gatherings); and (c) small world lattice (partial to full lockdown—“social” distancing). This model exhibits good qualitative agreement between simulation and data from the 2020 pandemic spread of a novel coronavirus.

However, vast within-country health inequalities remain. We present a baseline of health inequalities in the region, against which progress towards the SDGs can be monitored. SETTING: We studied 21 countries in LAC using data from Demographic and Health Surveys and Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey carried out from 2011 to 2016 PARTICIPANTS: The surveys collect nationally representative data on women and children using multistage sampling. In total, 288 207 women and 195 092 children made part of the surveys in the 21 countries. OUTCOME MEASURES: Five health intervention indicators were studied, related to reproductive and maternal health, along with adolescent fertility and neonatal and under-five mortality rates. Inequalities in these indicators were assessed through absolute and relative measures. RESULTS: In most countries, subnational geographical health gradients were observed for nearly all women, child, and adolescent (WCA) indicators. Coverage of key interventions was higher in urban areas and among the richest, compared with rural areas and poorer quintiles. Analyses by woman’s age showed that coverage was lower in adolescent girls than older women for family planning indicators. Pro-urban and pro-rich inequalities were also seen for mortality in most countries. CONCLUSIONS: Regional averages hide important health inequalities between countries, but national estimates hide still greater inequalities between subgroups of women, children and adolescents. To achieve the SDG3 targets and leave no one behind, it is essential to close health inequality gaps within as well as between countries.","Sanhueza, Antonio; Carvajal-Vélez, Liliana; Mújica, Oscar J; Vidaletti, Luis Paulo; Victora, Cesar G; Barros, Aluisio JD",BMJ Open,425,17

It is suggested that leptin could be the missing link between obesity and severe COVID-19. Our study aimed to unravel the link between adipokines, COVID-19 status, immune response, and outcomes in severe pneumonia. METHODS: In this prospective observational single-center study, 63 immunocompetent patients with severe pneumonia (36 non-COVID-19 and 27 COVID-19) were enrolled, most required intensive care. Clinical and biological characteristics (glucose metabolism, plasma adipokines, and cytokine concentrations) and outcomes were compared. RESULTS: At similar baseline severity, COVID-19 patients required mechanical ventilation for significantly longer than non-COVID-19 patients (p = 0.0049). Plasma concentrations of leptin and adiponectin were respectively positively and negatively correlated with BMI and glucose metabolism (glycemia and insulinemia), but not significantly different between the two groups. Leptin levels were negatively correlated with IL-1β and IL-6, but the adipokines were not correlated with most other inflammatory mediators, baseline severity (SOFA score), or the duration of mechanical ventilation. CONCLUSION: Adipokine levels were correlated with BMI but not with most inflammatory mediators, severity, or outcomes in severe pneumonia, regardless of the origin. The link between obesity, dysregulated immune response, and life-threatening COVID-19 requires further investigation.

In England, infections, hospitalisations and deaths fell during the first two steps of the 'roadmap' for exiting the third national lockdown. The third step of the roadmap in England takes place on 17 May 2021. Methods We report the most recent findings on community infections from the REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission-1 (REACT-1) study in which a swab is obtained from a representative cross-sectional sample of the population in England and tested using PCR. Round 11 of REACT-1 commenced self-administered swab-collection on 15 April 2021 and completed collections on 3 May 2021. We compare the results of REACT-1 round 11 to round 10, in which swabs were collected from 11 to 30 March 2021. Results Between rounds 10 and 11, prevalence of swab-positivity dropped by 50% in England from 0.20% (0.17%, 0.23%) to 0.10% (0.08%, 0.13%), with a corresponding R estimate of 0.90 (0.87, 0.94). Rates of swab-positivity fell in the 55 to 64 year old group from 0.17% (0.12%, 0.25%) in round 10 to 0.06% (0.04%, 0.11%) in round 11. Prevalence in round 11 was higher in the 25 to 34 year old group at 0.21% (0.12%, 0.38%) than in the 55 to 64 year olds and also higher in participants of Asian ethnicity at 0.31% (0.16%, 0.60%) compared with white participants at 0.09% (0.07%, 0.11%). Based on sequence data for positive samples for which a lineage could be identified, we estimate that 92.3% (75.9%, 97.9%, n=24) of infections were from the B.1.1.7 lineage compared to 7.7% (2.1%, 24.1%, n=2) from the B.1.617.2 lineage. Both samples from the B.1.617.2 lineage were detected in London from participants not reporting travel in the previous two weeks. Also, allowing for suitable lag periods, the prior close alignment between prevalence of infections and hospitalisations and deaths nationally has diverged. Discussion We observed marked reductions in prevalence from March to April and early May 2021 in England reflecting the success of the vaccination programme and despite easing of restrictions during lockdown. However, there is potential upwards pressure on prevalence from the further easing of lockdown regulations and presence of the B.1.617.2 lineage. If prevalence rises in the coming weeks, policy-makers will need to assess the possible impact on hospitalisations and deaths. In addition, consideration should be given to other health and economic impacts if increased levels of community transmission occur.","Riley, S.; Haw, D. J.; Walters, C.

For the last three decades, PEDV infection has resulted in significant economic losses in the European and Asian pig industries, but in 2013–2014 the disease was also reported in the US, Canada and Mexico. The PED epidemic in the US, from April 2013 to the present, has led to the loss of more than 10% of the US pig population. The disappearance and re-emergence of epidemic PED indicates that the virus is able to escape from current vaccination protocols, biosecurity and control systems. Endemic PED is a significant problem, which is exacerbated by the emergence (or potential importation) of multiple PEDV variants. Epidemic PEDV strains spread rapidly and cause a high number of pig deaths. These strains are highly enteropathogenic and acutely infect villous epithelial cells of the entire small and large intestines although the jejunum and ileum are the primary sites. PEDV infections cause acute, severe atrophic enteritis accompanied by viremia that leads to profound diarrhea and vomiting, followed by extensive dehydration, which is the major cause of death in nursing piglets. A comprehensive understanding of the pathogenic characteristics of epidemic or endemic PEDV strains is needed to prevent and control the disease in affected regions and to develop an effective vaccine. This review focuses on the etiology, epidemiology, disease mechanisms and pathogenesis as well as immunoprophylaxis against PEDV infection.","Jung, Kwonil; Saif, Linda J.",Vet J,425,1

Although there are several promising drug candidates in clinical trials, none is available clinically. Thus, the drug repurposing approach may help to overcome the current pandemic. Methods The main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2 is crucial for cleaving nascent polypeptide chains. Here, FDA-approved antiviral and anti-infection drugs were screened by high-throughput virtual screening (HTVS) followed by re-docking with standard-precision (SP) and extra-precision (XP) molecular docking. The most potent drug's binding was further validated by free energy calculations (Prime/MM-GBSA) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Results Out of 1397 potential drugs, 157 showed considerable affinity towards Mpro. After HTVS, SP, and XP molecular docking, four high-affinity lead drugs (Iodixanol, Amikacin, Troxerutin, and Rutin) with docking energies -10.629 to -11.776kcal/mol range were identified. Among them, Amikacin exhibited the lowest Prime/MM-GBSA energy (-73.800kcal/mol). It led us to evaluate other aminoglycosides (Neomycin, Paramomycin, Gentamycin, Streptomycin, and Tobramycin) against Mpro. All aminoglycosides were bound to the substrate-binding site of Mpro and interacted with crucial residues. Altogether, Amikacin was found to be the most potent inhibitor of Mpro. MD simulations of the Amikacin-Mpro complex suggested the formation of a complex stabilized by hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, and van der Waals interactions. Conclusion Aminoglycosides may serve as a scaffold to design potent drug molecules against COVID-19. However, further validation by in vitro and in vivo studies are required before using aminoglycosides as an anti-COVID-19 agent.","Ahmed, Mohammad Z.; Zia, Qamar; Haque, Anzarul; Alqahtani, Ali S.; Almarfadi, Omar M.; Banawas, Saeed; Alqahtani, Mohammed S.; Ameta, Keshav Lalit; Haque, Shafiul",J Infect Public Health,425,20

On the one hand, many have argued that they should be kept open, given their importance to youngsters and the future of the country, and the effort many countries have made in establishing protocols to keep them safe. On the other hand, it has been argued that open schools further the spread of the virus, given that these are places with large-scale interaction between teenagers and adults accompanying their children, as well as a major source of congestion on public transportation. We aim to identify the effect of school openings on the spread of COVID-19 contagion. Italy offers an interesting quasi-experimental setting in this regard due to the scattered openings that schools have experienced. By means of a quantitative analysis, employing a synthetic control method approach, we find that Bolzano, the first province in Italy to open schools after the summer break, had far more cases than its synthetic counterfactual, built from a donor pool formed from the other Italian provinces. Results confirm the hypothesis that despite the precautions, opening schools causes an increase in the infection rate, and this must be taken into account by policymakers.","Alfano, Vincenzo; Ercolano, Salvatore; Cicatiello, Lorenzo",Health Policy,425,16

METHODS: Data from 77,075 individuals aged 20 to 59 from three steps of the EPICOVID-19 Brazil (a nationwide serological survey conducted between May and June, 2021) were assessed. The presence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 was examined by rapid tests. Self-reported prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, asthma, cancer, chronic kidney disease and heart disease were investigated. The prevalence of mask use, adherence to isolation measures and antibodies were evaluated separately amid carriers and non-carriers of chronic diseases. The prevalence of symptoms was analyzed among carriers and non-carriers of chronic diseases with antibodies. RESULTS: The prevalence of at least one chronic disease was 43%, higher in the Southeast region, among white and indigenous individuals, women, less schooled and in lower socioeconomic position. The use of masks when leaving home was similar among carriers and non-carriers of chronic diseases (98%). The proportion of participants who reported adherence to isolation measures was higher amid carriers (15.9%) than non-carriers (24.9%) of chronic diseases. The prevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 was similar amongst carriers and non-carriers (2.4% and 2.3%). The prevalence of cough, dyspnea, palpitations and myalgia was significantly higher among carriers, but the proportion of symptomatic patients was similar between groups. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of chronic diseases in Brazil is high and the COVID-19 pandemic affects carriers and non-carriers of chronic diseases similarly. Carriers present more severe forms of COVID-19 and higher prevalence of symptoms. Greater adherence to social distancing measures among chronic patients is disassociated from a lower incidence of COVID-19 in this group.","Mesenburg, Marilia Arndt; Hallal, Pedro Curi; Menezes, Ana Maria Baptista; Barros, Aluísio J D; Horta, Bernardo Lessa; de Barros, Fernando Celso; Hartwig, Fernando Pires; Jacques, Nadège; da Silveira, Mariangela Freitas",Revista de saude publica,425,29

With the current pandemic situation, the testing and detection of this disease are becoming a challenge in many regions across the globe because of the insufficiency of the suitable testing infrastructure. The shortage of kits to test COVID-19 has led to another crisis owing to worldwide supply-demand mismatch, and thereby, widen up a new research area that deals with the detection of COVID-19 without the test kit. In this paper, we investigate medical images, mostly chest X-ray images and thorax computed tomography (CT) scans to identify the attack of COVID-19. In countries, where the number of medical experts is lesser than the expected as recommended by WHO, this computer-aided system can be useful as it requires minimal human intervention. Consequently, this technology reduces the chances of contagious infection. This study may further help in the early detection of people with some similar symptoms of coronavirus. Early detection and intervention can play a pivotal role in coronavirus treatment. The primary goal of our work is to detect COVID-19–affected cases. However, this work can be extended to detect pneumonia because of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, and bacteria-like Streptococcus. In this paper, we employ publicly available medical images obtained from various demographics, and propose a rapid cost-effective test leveraging a deep learning-based framework. Here, we propose a new architecture based on a densely connected convolutional neural network to analyze the COVID-19–affected medical images. We name our proposed architecture as DenserNet, which is an improvisation of DenseNet.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the relationship between DECTPA and disease duration, right ventricular dysfunction (RVD), lung compliance, D-dimer and obstruction index in COVID-19 pneumonia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This institutional review board approved this retrospective study, and waived the informed consent requirement. Between March-May 2020, 27 consecutive ventilated patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia underwent DECTPA to diagnose pulmonary thrombus (PT); 11 underwent surveillance DECTPA 14 ±11.6 days later. Qualitative and quantitative analysis of perfused blood volume (PBV) maps recorded: i) perfusion defect ‘pattern’ (wedge-shaped, mottled or amorphous), ii) presence of PT and CT obstruction index (CTOI) and iii) PBV relative to pulmonary artery enhancement (PBV/PAenh); PBV/PAenh was also compared with seven healthy volunteers and correlated with D-Dimer and CTOI. RESULTS: Amorphous (n=21), mottled (n=4), and wedge-shaped (n=2) perfusion defects were observed (M=20; mean age=56 ±8.7 years). Mean extent of perfusion defects=36.1%±17.2. Acute PT was present in 11/27(40.7%) patients. Only wedge-shaped defects corresponded with PT (2/27, 7.4%). Mean CTOI was 2.6±5.4 out of 40. PBV/PAenh (18.2 ±4.2%) was lower than in healthy volunteers (27 ±13.9%, p = 0.002). PBV/PAenh correlated with disease duration (β = 0.13, p = 0.04), and inversely correlated with RVD (β = -7.2, p = 0.001), persisting after controlling for confounders. There were no linkages between PBV/PAenh and D-dimer or CTOI. CONCLUSION: Perfusion defects and decreased PBV/PAenh are prevalent in severe COVID-19 pneumonia. PBV/PAenh correlates with disease duration and inversely correlates with RVD. PBV/PAenh may be an important marker of vasculopathy in severe COVID-19 pneumonia even in the absence of arterial thrombus.","Ridge, Carole A; Desai, Sujal R; Jeyin, Nidhish; Mahon, Ciara; Lother, Dione L; Mirsadraee, Saeed; Semple, Tom; Price, Susanna; Bleakley, Caroline; Arachchillage, Deepa J; Shaw, Elizabeth; Patel, Brijesh V; Padley, Simon PG; Devaraj, Anand",Radiol Cardiothorac Imaging,425,1

The policy is still however highly debated because of controversial evidence. Moreover, the specific mechanisms leading to mitigation are not clearly identified. METHODS: We introduced a stochastic spatial age-specific metapopulation model to assess the role of holiday-associated behavioral changes and how they affect seasonal influenza dynamics. The model is applied to Belgium, parameterized with country-specific data on social mixing and travel, and calibrated to the 2008/2009 influenza season. It includes behavioral changes occurring during weekend vs. weekday, and holiday vs. school-term. Several experimental scenarios are explored to identify the relevant social and behavioral mechanisms. RESULTS: Stochastic numerical simulations show that holidays considerably delay the peak of the season and mitigate its impact. Changes in mixing patterns are responsible for the observed effects, whereas changes in travel behavior do not alter the epidemic. Weekends are important in slowing down the season by periodically dampening transmission. Christmas holidays have the largest impact on the epidemic, however later school breaks may help in reducing the epidemic size, stressing the importance of considering the full calendar. An extension of the Christmas holiday of 1 week may further mitigate the epidemic. CONCLUSION: Changes in the way individuals establish contacts during holidays are the key ingredient explaining the mitigating effect of regular school closure. Our findings highlight the need to quantify these changes in different demographic and epidemic contexts in order to provide accurate and reliable evaluations of closure effectiveness. They also suggest strategic policies in the distribution of holiday periods to minimize the epidemic impact.

A few reports have showed that mortality due to SARS-CoV-2 is higher in elderly patients and other active comorbidities including cancer. To date, no effective treatment has been identified and management for critically ill patients relies on management in intensive care units. Patients with lung cancer are at risk of pulmonary complications from COVID-19. Furthermore, the use of chemotherapy might have a negative impact in patient’s outcome. Therefore, the risk/benefit ratio of systemic anticancer treatment (SACT) has to be considered.

The Monte Carlo method is used to expand data samples. Then, an ELM method is used to establish the prediction model of the dyeing time of the nonwoven fiber material overlaps with the porous medium, as well as the insertion degree and height of the different quantity of hides. Compared with the back propagation (BP) neural network and radial basis function (RBF) neural network, the results show that the prediction model based on the MCELM method has significant power in terms of accuracy and prediction speed, which is conducive to the precise and rapid manufacture of nonwoven fiber materials in practical applications between liquid seepage characteristics and structural characteristics of porous media. Furthermore, the relationship between the proposed models has certain value for predicting the behavior and use of nonwoven fiber materials with different structural characteristics and related research processes.","Zhang, Jing; Fan, Yiqiang; Zhang, Lulu; Xu, Chi; Dong, Xiaobin; Liu, Luyao; Zhang, Zhongping; Qiu, Xianbo",Sensors (Basel),425,24

Though school aged children are often recognized as driving the transmission of influenza as well as other respiratory viruses, little detailed information is available on the distribution of respiratory infections among children of different ages within this group. Factors other than age including gender and time spent in school may also be important in determining risk of infection but have been little studied in this age group. METHODS: We conducted a cohort study to determine the etiology of influenza like illness (ILI) among 2519 K–12 students during the 2012–13 influenza season. We obtained nasal swabs from students with ILI-related absences. Generalized linear mixed-effect regressions determined associations of outcomes, including ILI and laboratory-confirmed respiratory virus infection, with school grade and other covariates. RESULTS: Overall, 459 swabs were obtained from 552 ILI–related absences. Respiratory viruses were found in 292 (63.6%) samples. Influenza was found in 189 (41.2%) samples. With influenza B found in 134 (70.9%). Rates of influenza B were significantly higher in grades 1 (10.1, 95% CI 6.8–14.4%), 2 (9.7, 6.6–13.6%), 3 (9.3, 6.3–13.2%), and 4 (9.9, 6.8–13.8%) than in kindergarteners (3.2, 1.5–6.0%). After accounting for grade, sex and self-reported vaccination status, influenza B infection risk was lower among kindergarteners in half-day programs compared to kindergarteners in full-day programs (OR = 0.19; 95% CI 0.08–0.45). CONCLUSIONS: ILI and influenza infection is concentrated in younger schoolchildren. Reduced infection by respiratory viruses is associated with a truncated school day for kindergarteners but this finding requires further investigation in other grades and populations.

Mental health service users’ experiences, reflecting on the complex nature of using music participation in recovery are, however, limited. This essay considers literature that explores how music can support mental health service users in a recovery process. We have selected studies that include a broad spectrum of music activities, as well as literature considering various concepts about recovery. The conceptual recovery framework CHIME, that includes five important components in the recovery process, is used as the backdrop for exploring music activities as a contribution to recovery-oriented practice and services in mental health care. Eleven key components are identified in which music can support the recovery process: Feelings of equality; Social and emotional wellbeing; Tolerance; Hope and social agency; Triggering encounters; Redefining and reframing; A social practice; Moments of flow and peak experiences; Moments of meaning; Continuity; and Potentials instead of limitations. This essay concludes that the experiential knowledge of music activities from service users’ perspectives is essential knowledge when developing and using music activities in mental health recovery services. While this essay acknowledges that music activities can also produce unintended negative outcomes, the focus is on the positive contributions of music to mental health recovery processes.","Damsgaard, Janne Brammer; Jensen, Anita",Int J Environ Res Public Health,425,16

Many global communities, international programs, and governmental organizations have been established to mitigate these risks and challenges. In China, for example, the government has systematically implemented long-term plans including a complete country-wide architecture for biosafety management. It includes the establishment of a series of improved biosafety laws/regulations/standards and of a large number of high-level biosafety laboratories. All countries should encourage preparedness and improve surveillance systems to predict, identify, and respond to the next public health crisis. More grants and funds should be established for research into biosafety and biosecurity. Most importantly, international collaborations, partnerships, and communications should be enhanced.

Diagnostic testing remained one of the limiting factors for early identification and isolation of infected patients. This study aimed to evaluate posterior oropharyngeal saliva (POPS) for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) detection among patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19. METHODS: The laboratory information system was searched retrospectively for all respiratory specimens and POPS requested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection between Feb 1, 2020 and Apr 15, 2020. The agreement and diagnostic performance of POPS against NPsp were evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 13772 specimens were identified during the study period, including 2130 POPS and 8438 NPsp. Two hundred and twenty-nine same-day POPS-NPsp paired were identified with POPS and NPsp positivity of 61.5% (95% CI [55.1–67.6%]) and 53.3% (95% CI [46.8–59.6%]). The overall, negative and positive percent agreement were 76.0% (95% CI [70.2–80.9%]), 65.4% (95% CI [55.5–74.2%]), 85.2% (95% CI [77.4–90.8%]). Better positive percent agreement was observed in POPS-NPsp obtained within seven days (96.6%, 95% CI [87.3–99.4%]) compared with after seven days of symptom onset (75.0%, 95% CI [61.4–85.2%)). Among the 104 positive pairs, the mean difference in Cp value was 0.26 (range: 12.63 to -14.74), with an overall higher Cp value in NPsp (Pearson coefficient 0.579). No significant temporal variation was noted between the two specimen types.

Unlike many other disasters which are short-term, single events, this has been an on-going event. Changes at both health systems included workflow alterations for exposure reduction to faculty, trainees, and staff. UHSA was able to quickly divert workflow to previously deployed home workstations, while University of Utah Health Sciences Center required 2 to 3 weeks to procure and initialize enough remote workstations to significantly affect departmental operations. Other measures such as universal masking, temperature screening at facility entrances, virtual appointments, and physical barriers were used by both systems to limit patient-to-patient, patient-to-staff, staff-to-patient, and staff-staff physical interaction to help decrease exposure risk.

METHODS: Pooled rate of each of the rs713598, rs1726866, rs10246939, and PAV/AVI polymorphisms of the TAS2R38 gene was obtained in different countries using a systematic review methodology and its relationship with the mortality of COVID-19. Data were analyzed by the comprehensive meta-analysis software and SPSS. RESULTS: There was only a significant reverse Pearson correlation in death counts and PAV/AVI ratio, p = 0.047, r = −0.503. Also, a significant reverse correlation of PAV/AVI ratio and death rate was seen, r = −0.572 p = 0.021. rs10246939 ratio had a significant positive correlation with death rate, r = 0.851 p = 0.031. Further analysis was not significant. Our results showed that the higher presence of PAV allele than AVI, and a higher rate of G allele than A in rs10246939 polymorphism in a country, could be associated with lower COVID-19 mortality. While assessing all three polymorphisms showed a huge diversity worldwide. CONCLUSION: Due to extraoral activities of bitter taste receptor genes, especially in mucosal immunity, this gene seems to be a good candidate for future studies on COVID-19 pathophysiology. Also, the high worldwide diversity of TAS2R38 genes polymorphism and its possible assassination with mortality raises concerns about the efficiency of vaccine projects in different ethnicities.","Parsa, Shima; Mogharab, Vahid; Ebrahimi, Mohsen; Ahmadi, Sayyed Reza; Shahi, Behzad; Mehramiz, Neema John; Foroughian, Mahdi; Zarenezhad, Mohammad; Kalani, Navid; Abdi, Mohammad Hashem; Javdani, Farshid; Keshavarz, Pouyan; Hatami, Naser",Int J Biol Macromol,425,6

SSA countries bear significantly high proportions of TB and HIV cases reported worldwide, compared to countries in the West. Whilst COVID-19 epidemiology appears to vary across Africa, most countries in this region have reported relatively lower-case counts compared to the West. Nevertheless, the COVID-19 pandemic has added an additional burden to already overstretched health systems in SSA, which, among other things, have been focused on the longstanding dual epidemics of TB and HIV. As with these dual epidemics, inadequate resources and poor case identification and reporting may be contributing to underestimations of the COVID-19 case burden in SSA. Modelling studies predict that the pandemic-related disruptions in TB and HIV services will result in significant increases in associated morbidity and mortality over the next five years. Furthermore, limited empirical evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 coinfections with TB and HIV are associated with increased mortality risk in SSA. However, predictive models require a better evidence-base to accurately define the impact of COVID-19, not only on communicable diseases such as TB and HIV, but on non-communicable disease comorbidities. Further research is needed to assess morbidity and mortality data among both adults and children across the African continent, paying attention to geographic disparities, as well as the clinical and socio-economic determinants of COVID-19 in the setting of TB and/or HIV.","Nachega, Jean B.; Kapata, Nathan; Sam-Agudu, Nadia A.; Decloedt, Eric H.; Katoto, Patrick D.M.C.; Nagu, Tumaini; Mwaba, Peter; Yeboah-Manu, Dorothy; Chanda-Kapata, Pascalina; Ntoumi, Francine; Geng, Elvin H.; Zumla, Alimuddin",Int J Infect Dis,425,27

DESIGN: A multicentre cohort study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: 1542 patients with COVID-19 admitted to ICUs in public hospitals of Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates between 1 March 2020 and 22 July 2020. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was time from ICU admission until death. We used competing risk regression models and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator to identify the factors, and to construct a risk score. Predictive ability of the score was assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), and the Brier score using 500 bootstraps replications. RESULTS: Among patients admitted to ICU, 196 (12.7%) died, 1215 (78.8%) were discharged and 131 (8.5%) were right-censored. The cumulative mortality incidence was 14% (95% CI 12.17% to 15.82%). From 36 potential predictors, we identified seven factors associated with mortality, and included in the risk score: age (adjusted HR (AHR) 1.98; 95% CI 1.71 to 2.31), neutrophil percentage (AHR 1.71; 95% CI 1.27 to 2.31), lactate dehydrogenase (AHR 1.31; 95% CI 1.15 to 1.49), respiratory rate (AHR 1.31; 95% CI 1.15 to 1.49), creatinine (AHR 1.19; 95% CI 1.11 to 1.28), Glasgow Coma Scale (AHR 0.70; 95% CI 0.63 to 0.78) and oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) (AHR 0.82; 95% CI 0.74 to 0.91). The mean AUC was 88.1 (95% CI 85.6 to 91.6), and the Brier score was 8.11 (95% CI 6.74 to 9.60). We developed a freely available web-based risk calculator (https://icumortalityrisk.shinyapps.io/ICUrisk/). CONCLUSION: In critically ill patients with COVID-19, we identified factors associated with mortality, and developed a risk prediction tool that showed high predictive ability. This tool may have utility in clinical settings to guide decision-making, and may facilitate the identification of supportive therapies to improve outcomes.","Alkaabi, Salem; Alnuaimi, Asma; Alharbi, Mariam; Amari, Mohammed A; Ganapathy, Rajiv; Iqbal, Imran; Nauman, Javaid; Oulhaj, Abderrahim",BMJ Open,425,20

Here, we conducted retrospective analyses in two cohorts of patients with acute respiratory distress (ARD, n = 18,547) and three cohorts with pneumonia (n = 400,907). Federated across two ARD cohorts, we find that patients exposed to ⍺(1)-AR antagonists, as compared to unexposed patients, had a 34% relative risk reduction for mechanical ventilation and death (OR = 0.70, p = 0.021). We replicated these methods on three pneumonia cohorts, all with similar effects on both outcomes. All results were robust to sensitivity analyses.

However, most of the assistive systems and technologies for supporting eating and drinking require a residual mobility in arms or hands. For people without residual mobility, different hands-free controls have been developed. For hands-free control, the combination of different modalities can lead to great advantages and improved control. The novelty of this work is a new concept to control a robot using a combination of head and eye motions. The control unit is a mobile, compact and low-cost multimodal sensor system. A Magnetic Angular Rate Gravity (MARG)-sensor is used to detect head motion and an eye tracker enables the system to capture the user’s gaze. To analyze the performance of the two modalities, an experimental evaluation with ten able-bodied subjects and one subject with tetraplegia was performed. To assess discrete control (event-based control), a button activation task was performed. To assess two-dimensional continuous cursor control, a Fitts’s Law task was performed. The usability study was related to a use-case scenario with a collaborative robot assisting a drinking action. The results of the able-bodied subjects show no significant difference between eye motions and head motions for the activation time of the buttons and the throughput, while, using the eye tracker in the Fitts’s Law task, the error rate was significantly higher. The subject with tetraplegia showed slightly better performance for button activation when using the eye tracker. In the use-case, all subjects were able to use the control unit successfully to support the drinking action. Due to the limited head motion of the subject with tetraplegia, button activation with the eye tracker was slightly faster than with the MARG-sensor. A further study with more subjects with tetraplegia is planned, in order to verify these results.","Stalljann, Sarah; Wöhle, Lukas; Schäfer, Jeroen; Gebhard, Marion",Sensors (Basel),425,12

The aim of the present study was to compare the efficacy, safety, and health‐related quality of life (HRQOL) of interferon alfa (IFN‐α) alone or in combination with oral amantadine for treatment of chronic hepatitis C. One hundred nineteen previously untreated patients with chronic hepatitis C were randomly allocated to treatment with IFN‐α2a at a dose of 6 megaunits 3 times a week subcutaneously for 24 weeks, followed by 3 megaunits thrice weekly for an additional 24 weeks plus amantadine sulphate administered orally 100 mg twice a day for 48 weeks or the same IFN regimen plus a matched placebo. The primary endpoint was undectable serum HCV RNA (<1,000 copies/mL) at week 24 after treatment. At the end of treatment and the 24‐week follow‐up period serum HCV RNA was undetectable in 20 (34%) and 6 (10%) of the 59 patients treated with the combination IFN‐α plus amantadine and in 20 (33%) and 13 (22%) of the 60 patients treated with IFN‐α alone, respectively (P = n.s.). Discontinuation of therapy for adverse events was similar in both treatment groups. Although treatment with IFN‐α worsened HRQOL, combination with amantadine showed a substantial trend to improve fatigue and vigor. In conclusion, combination therapy IFN‐α plus amantadine is as effective as IFN‐α monotherapy in previously untreated patients with chronic hepatitis C.","Zeuzem, Stefan; Teuber, Gerlinde; Naumann, Uta; Berg, Thomas; Raedle, Jochen; Hartmann, Susanne; Hopf, Uwe",Hepatology,425,24

This population upheld specific characteristics in terms of age and sex, lack of significant comorbidities, and a general scarcity of risk factors for sustaining a severe COVID-19 illness. We present the measures taken to increase vaccination compliance, and the vaccination rate that followed these actions. Our secondary goal was to compare between vaccination rates in frontline battalions and highly essential military units (group A) and rear administration and support military units (group B). METHODS: This was a retrospective review that included 70 military units that were composed of 18,719 individuals of both sexes, mostly free of significant comorbidities. We divided the challenges of maximizing vaccination rates into two main categories: vaccine compliance (including communication and information) and logistical challenges. We compared the vaccination rates in groups A and B using a multivariable linear regression model. A P-value of .05 was considered significant. RESULTS: The mean age in 70 military units was 22.77 ± 1.35 (range 18-50) years, 71.13% males. A total of 726 (3.88%) individuals have been found positive for SARS-CoV-2 between March 1st, 2020 and February 18th, 2021. On February 18th, 2021, 54 days after the vaccination campaign was launched, 15,871 (84.79%) of the study population have been vaccinated by the first dose of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, expressing an 88.21% compliance rate (excluding recovered COVID-19 cases who were not prioritized to be vaccinated at this stage). Vaccination compliance in military units from group A was found to be higher when compared to group B (P < .001), leading to a 90.02% of group A population being either previously SARS-CoV-2 positive or COVID-19 vaccinated. CONCLUSIONS: A designated army campaign led by a multidisciplinary team could rapidly achieve a high COVID-19 vaccination rate. The information presented can serve organizations worldwide with similar characteristics that plan a mass COVID-19 vaccination campaign.","Segal, David; Arzi, Yonatan Ilibman; Bez, Maxim; Cohen, Matan; Rotschield, Jacob; Fink, Noam; Karp, Erez",Mil Med,425,16

We use an SEIR agent-based model on a graph, with realistic epidemiological parameters. Simulating variations in certain parameters of Testing & Tracing, we find that important determinants of successful containment are: (i) the time from symptom onset until a patient is self-isolated and tested, and (ii) the share of contacts of a positive patient who are successfully traced. Comparatively less important is (iii) the time of test analysis and contact tracing. When the share of contacts successfully traced is higher, the Test & Trace Time rises somewhat in importance. These results are robust to a wide range of values for how infectious presymptomatic patients are, to the amount of asymptomatic patients, to the network degree distribution and to base epidemic growth rate. We also provide mathematical arguments for why these simulation results hold in more general settings. Since real world Test & Trace systems and policies could affect all three parameters, Symptom Onset to Test Time should be considered, alongside test turnaround time and contact tracing coverage, as a key determinant of Test & Trace success.","Reich, O.",,425,26

SARS‐CoV‐2 infection caused mildly to seriously and fatally respiratory, enteric, cardiovascular, and neurological diseases. In this study, we detected and analyzed the main laboratory indicators related to heart injury, creatine kinase isoenzyme‐MB (CK‐MB), myohemoglobin (MYO), cardiac troponin I (ultra‐TnI), and N‐terminal pro‐brain natriuretic peptide (NT‐proBNP), in 273 patients with COVID‐19 and investigated the correlation between heart injury and severity of the disease. It was found that higher concentration in venous blood of CK‐MB, MYO, ultra‐TnI, and NT‐proBNP were associated with the severity and case fatality rate of COVID‐19. Careful monitoring of the myocardiac enzyme profiles is of great importance in reducing the complications and mortality in patients with COVID‐19.","Han, Huan; Xie, Linlin; Liu, Rui; Yang, Jie; Liu, Fang; Wu, Kailang; Chen, Lang; Hou, Wei; Feng, Yong; Zhu, Chengliang",J Med Virol,425,16

This unprecedented situation led to the inception of numerous fundamental research protocols and many clinical trials. It quickly became apparent that although COVID-19, in the vast majority of cases, was a benign disease, it could also develop a severe form with sometimes fatal outcomes. Cytokines are central to the pathophysiology of COVID-19; while some of them are beneficial (type-I interferon, interleukin-7), others appear detrimental (interleukin-1β, -6, and TNF-α) particularly in the context of the so-called cytokine storm. Yet another characteristic of the disease has emerged: concomitant immunodeficiency, notably involving impaired type-I interferon response, and lymphopenia. This review provides an overview of current knowledge on COVID-19 immunopathology. We discuss the defective type-I IFN response, the theoretical role of IL-7 to restore lymphocyte repertoire, as well as we mention the two patterns observed in severe COVID-19 (i.e. interleukin-1β-driven macrophage activation syndrome vs. interleukin-6-driven immune dysregulation). Next, reviewing current evidence drawn from clinical trials, we examine a number of cytokine and anti-cytokine therapies, including interleukin-1, -6, and TNF inhibitors, as well as less targeted therapies, such as corticosteroids, chloroquine, or JAK inhibitors.","Jamilloux, Yvan; Henry, Thomas; Belot, Alexandre; Viel, Sébastien; Fauter, Maxime; El Jammal, Thomas; Walzer, Thierry; François, Bruno; Sève, Pascal",Autoimmun Rev,425,15

Methods >9,000 respondents in an ongoing cross-sectional participatory longitudinal epidemiology study (LoC-19, n=18,581) completed a questionnaire within their personal electronic health record in the week reporting first effective Covid-19 vaccines, and then again after widespread publicity of the increased transmissibility of a new variant (November 13th and December 31st 2020 respectively). Questions covered willingness to receive Covid-19 vaccination and attitudes to prioritisation. Descriptive statistics, unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and natural language processing of free-text responses are reported, and how changes over the first 50 days of both vaccination roll-out and new-variant impact modelling of anticipated transmission rates and the likelihood and time to herd immunity. Findings Compared with the week reporting the first efficacious vaccine there was a 15% increase in acceptance of Covid-19 vaccination, attributable in one third to the impact of the new variant, with 75% of respondents ""shielding"" -- staying at home and not leaving unless essential -- regardless of health status or tier rules. 12.5% of respondents plan to change their behaviour two weeks after completing vaccination compared with 45% intending to do so only when cases have reduced to a low level. Despite the increase from 71% to 86% over this critical 50-day period, modelling of planned uptake of vaccination remains below that required for rapid effective herd immunity -- now estimated to be 90 percent in the presence of a new variant escalating R0 to levels requiring further lockdowns. To inform the public messaging essential therefore to improve uptake, age and female gender were, respectively, strongly positively and negatively associated with wanting a vaccine. 22.7% disagreed with the prioritisation list, though 70.3% were against being able to expedite vaccination through payment. Teachers (988, 12.6%) and Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) (837, 10.7%) groups were most cited by respondents for prioritisation. Interpretation In this sample, the growing impact of personal choice among the increasingly informed public highlights a decrease in Covid-19 vaccine hesitancy over time, with news of a new variant motivating increased willingness for vaccination but at levels below what may be required for effective herd immunity. We identify public preferences for next-in-line priorities, headed by teachers and BAME groups, consideration of which will help build trust and community engagement critical for maximising compliance with not only the vaccination programme but also all other public health measures.","Bachtiger, P.; Adamson, A.; Maclean, W.

This case report with a literature review emphasizes a unique presentation of COVID-19 that is highly important for health care providers to consider when treating their patients. CASE REPORT: A 65-year-old Caucasian male patient presented to the emergency department with a 2-day history of dyspnea on exertion after his wife’s recent diagnosis of COVID-19. He additionally had experienced a couple of episodes of self-resolving diarrhea a few days before presentation. Based on the patient’s clinical presentation and the laboratory workup identifying an elevated D-dimer, a computed tomography angiogram of the chest was obtained, which was significant for moderately large, bilateral pulmonary emboli with a saddle embolus, and an associated small, left lower lobe, pulmonary infarct. Ultrasound of the lower extremity showed non-occlusive deep vein thrombosis at the distal left femoral vein to the left popliteal vein. The patient was additionally diagnosed with COVID-19 when the results of the COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction test returned as positive. The patient was admitted to the COVID unit, and he was started on an intravenously administered, unfractionated heparin drip for management of his bilateral pulmonary emboli and deep vein thrombosis. The patient’s clinical condition improved significantly with anticoagulation, and he was observed in the hospital for 3 days, after which he was discharged home on the enoxaparin bridge with warfarin. Post-discharge telephone calls at day 10 and week 4 revealed that the patient was appropriately responding to anticoagulation treatment and had no recurrence of his symptoms related to venous thromboembolism and COVID-19. CONCLUSION: As COVID-19 continues to lead to significant mortality, more data is emerging that is exposing its perplexing pathogenicity. Meanwhile, the presentation of venous thromboembolism in patients with COVID-19 remains an unusual finding. It is imperative for health care providers to be mindful of this unique association to make necessary diagnostic evaluations and provide appropriate treatment for the patients.","Bhatt, Harshil; Singh, Sandeep",J Med Case Rep,425,1

Understanding the association between loneliness and mortality is therefore critically important. We examined whether combinations of loneliness and social isolation, using a metric named social asymmetry, was associated with increased mortality risk. METHODS: The sample was derived from participants in The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing, a nationally representative sample of community-dwelling older adults aged ≥50. Survey data were linked to official death registration records. Cox proportional hazards regressions and competing risk survival analyses were used to examine the association between social asymmetry and all-cause and cause-specific mortality. RESULTS: Of four social asymmetry groups, concordant low lonely (low loneliness, low isolation) included 35.5% of participants; 26.4% were concordant high lonely (high loneliness, high isolation); 19.2% were discordant robust (low loneliness, high isolation) and 18.9% discordant susceptible (high loneliness, low isolation). The concordant high lonely (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.43, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.09–1.87) and discordant robust (HR = 1.37, 95% CI: 1.04–1.81) groups had an increased mortality risk compared to those in the concordant low lonely group. The concordant high lonely group had an increased risk of mortality due to diseases of the circulatory system (sub-distribution hazard ratio = 1.52, 95% CI: 1.03–2.25). CONCLUSION: We found that social asymmetry predicted mortality over a 7-year follow-up period. Our results confirm that a mismatch between subjective loneliness and objective social isolation, as well as the combination of loneliness and social isolation, were associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk.","Ward, Mark; May, Peter; Normand, Charles; Kenny, Rose Anne; Nolan, Anne",Age Ageing,425,10

It collects epidemiological variables, contagion and diagnosis data, signs and symptoms, treatments and outcomes. It is an “online” registry. Patients were diagnosed with SARS-Cov-2 infection based on the results of the PCR of the virus, carried out both in patients who had manifested compatible symptoms or had suspicious signs, as well as in those who had undergone screening after some contact. acquainted with another patient. Results As of April 11, the Registry had data on 868 patients, from all the Autonomous Communities. The most represented form of TRS is in-center hemodialysis (ICH) followed by transplant patients. Symptoms are similar to the general population. A very high percentage (85%) required hospital admission, 8% in intensive care units. The most used treatments were hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir-ritonavir, and steroids. Mortality is high and reaches 23%; deceased patients were more frequently on ICH, developed pneumonia more frequently, and received less frequently lopinavir-ritonavir and steroids. Age and pneumonia were independently associated with the risk of death. Conclusions SARS-CoV-2 infection already affects a significant number of Spanish patients on RRT, mainly those on ICH, hospitalization rates are very high and mortality is high; age and the development of pneumonia are factors associated with mortality.","Sánchez-Álvarez, J.

Characterizing the dynamics of transmission is essential for identifying which individuals and regions might be most at risk. As data from detailed contact-tracing investigations are not available in many settings, we developed an R package called o2geosocial to reconstruct the transmission clusters and the importation status of the cases from their age, location, genotype and onset date. We compared our inferred cluster size distributions to 737 transmission clusters identified through detailed contact-tracing in the USA between 2001 and 2016. We were able to reconstruct the importation status of the cases and found good agreement between the inferred and reference clusters. The results were improved when the contact-tracing investigations were used to set the importation status before running the model.

In this study we sought to establish what the current spiritual care practices are in hospice palliative care settings in South Africa with a focused view on what spiritual care training is currently offered and what training needs still remain unmet. METHODS: We explored spiritual care practices, and training needs, through a national quantitative online study of palliative care organisations in South Africa registered with the Hospice Palliative Care Association of South Africa. A survey was sent to representatives of all member organisations listed on the national database of Hospice Palliative Care Association of South Africa. Viable data from 41% (n = 40) member organisations were analysed through the use of simple statistics. RESULTS: An expressed need (75%; n = 30) was recorded for the development of a national spiritual care curriculum. Although 48% (n = 20) of the member organisations were willing to participate in the development of a spiritual care curriculum, 37% (n = 14) could not participate, citing financial (n = 27), time (n = 31) and expertise constraints (n = 22). A set of hard and soft skills were suggested to suit the diverse South African context. CONCLUSIONS: Spiritual care was seen by participants as a key component of palliative care.

The Department of Pathology responded by transitioning a fourth-year clinical elective to an all-remote format composed of synchronous didactics, daily clinical sign-out utilizing digital microscopy, and asynchronous learning materials. Thirty-seven medical students completed 2- or 4-week anatomic pathology electives tailored to meet their career goals and allowing them to progress toward graduation. Institutional Review Board approval was granted to survey students’ perceptions of engagement in the remote learning environment. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected using a standardized school-wide end-of-rotation survey, an online survey developed by the authors, and students’ self-directed learning goals. End-of-rotation data showed the remote pathology course performed well (4.88 of possible 5) when compared to all advanced clinical clerkships (4.51, n = 156 courses), all elective rotations (4.41, n = 50 courses), and the traditional in-person pathology elective (4.73). Core strengths in the virtual environment included high educational value, flexibility of content and schedule, organization, tailoring to an individual’s learning goals, and a positive education environment. Deficits included the inability to gross surgical specimens, inadequate observation or feedback about students’ skills, and impaired social connections. Areas for improvement included requests for in-person experiences and development of themed tracks for career exploration. Many aspects of anatomic pathology appear well-suited to the remote learning environment.

METHODS: In this umbrella review (an overview of systematic reviews), we investigated the association between dyslipidemia and COVID-19 severity. A systematic search was performed of 4 main electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library databases) from inception until August 2020. We evaluated the methodological quality of the included studies using the A MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) 2 tool and used the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system to assess the quality of evidence for the outcome. In addition, we evaluated the strengths and limitations of the evidence and the methodological quality of the available studies. RESULTS: Out of 35 articles identified, 2 systematic reviews were included in the umbrella review. A total of 7,951 COVID-19-positive patients were included. According to the AMSTAR 2 criteria and GRADE system, the quality of the included studies was not high. A history of dyslipidemia is likely to be associated with the severity of COVID-19 infection, but the contrary is the case for cholesterol levels at hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: Although existing research on dyslipidemia and COVID-19 is limited, our findings suggest that dyslipidemia may play a role in the severity of COVID-19 infection.

The authors developed a likelihood-based estimation procedure that infers the temporal pattern of effective reproduction numbers from an observed epidemic curve. Precise estimates for the effective reproduction numbers were obtained by applying this estimation procedure to available data for SARS outbreaks that occurred in Hong Kong, Vietnam, Singapore, and Canada in 2003. The effective reproduction numbers revealed that epidemics in the various affected regions were characterized by markedly similar disease transmission potentials and similar levels of effectiveness of control measures. In controlling SARS outbreaks, timely alerts have been essential: Delaying the institution of control measures by 1 week would have nearly tripled the epidemic size and would have increased the expected epidemic duration by 4 weeks.","Wallinga, Jacco; Teunis, Peter",Am J Epidemiol,425,1

Following the IMS, the bacteria were lysed, and the genome was amplified by double-tagging PCR, using a set of primers specific for the 16S rRNA gene for Mycobacterium. During the amplification, the amplicons were labeled with biotin and digoxigenin tags. Moreover, a comparative study of paper-based immunochromatographic platforms, relying on vertical and lateral flow and on the use of streptavidin gold nanoparticles as a signal generating system, was also performed. The visual readout was achieved when the gold-modified amplicons were captured by the anti-DIG antibody in the test line. The analytical performance of both methods, nucleic acid vertical flow (NAVF) and nucleic acid lateral flow (NALF), is also discussed. Although NALF showed lower limit of detections (LODs), both NALF and NAVF combined with IMS were able to detect the required LOD in hemodialysis water, becoming two promising and useful techniques for the rapid screening of water supplies in hemodialysis centers, to prevent the exposure of immunosuppressed patients to contaminated sources.","Ben Aissa, Alejandra; Araújo, Barbara; Julián, Esther; Boldrin Zanoni, Maria Valnice; Pividori, María Isabel",Sensors (Basel),425,32

The epidemiology of MERS-CoV remain enigmatic as human-to-human transmission is not fully understood. One possible scenario that might play a role in the virus transmission is the cultural waterpipe smoking. Cafés providing waterpipe smoking in cities within Saudi Arabia have been moved to areas outside city limits that frequently place them close to camels markets. We report results of a surveillance study wherein waterpipe hoses throughout several regions in Saudi Arabia were tested for the presence of MERS-CoV. A total of 2489 waterpipe samples were collected from cities where MERS-CoV cases were continuously recorded. MERS-CoV RNA wasn’t detected in collected samples. Irrespective of the negative results of our survey, the public health risk of waterpipe smoking should not be underestimated. To avoid a possible transmission within country where MERS-CoV is prevalent, we recommend the replacement of resusable hoses with “one-time-use” hoses in addition to a close inspection of waterpipe components to assure the appropriate cleaning and sanitization.","Alagaili, Abdulaziz N.; Briese, Thomas; Amor, Nabil M.S.; Mohammed, Osama B.; Lipkin, W.

To contextualise these data, we compared mortality related to COVID-19 during the first wave of the pandemic across seven countries in Europe with all and common causes of death, stratifying by age and sex. We also calculated deaths as a proportion of the population by age and sex. STUDY DESIGN: Analysis of population mortality data. METHODS: COVID-19 related mortality and population statistics from seven European countries were extracted: England and Wales, Italy, Germany, Spain, France, Portugal and Netherlands. Available data spanned 14–16 weeks since the first recorded deaths in each country, except Spain, where only comparable stratified data over an 8-week time period was available. The Global Burden of Disease database provided data on all deaths and those from pneumonia, cardiovascular disease combining ischaemic heart disease and stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cancer, road traffic accidents and dementia in 2017. RESULTS: Deaths related to COVID-19, while modest overall, varied considerably by age. Deaths as a percentage of all cause deaths during the time period under study ranged from <0.01% in children in Germany, Portugal and Netherlands, to as high as 41.65% for men aged over 80 years in England and Wales. The percentage of the population who died from COVID-19 was less than 0.2% in every age group under the age of 80. In each country, over the age of 80, these proportions were: England and Wales 1.27% males, 0.87% females; Italy 0.6% males, 0.38% females; Germany 0.13% males, 0.09% females; France 0.39% males, 0.2% females; Portugal 0.2% males, 0.15% females; and Netherlands 0.6% males, 0.4% females. CONCLUSIONS: Mortality rates from COVID-19 during the first wave of the pandemic were low including when compared to other common causes of death and are likely to decline further while control measures are maintained, treatments improve and vaccination is instituted. These data may help people to contextualise their risk and for decision-making by policymakers.","Olabi, Bayanne; Bagaria, Jayshree; Bhopal, Sunil S.; Curry, Gwenetta D.; Villarroel, Nazmy; Bhopal, Raj",Public Health Pract (Oxf),425,16

METHODS: We extracted data on outpatient visits and respiratory infection visits, and tests of respiratory viruses (adenovirus (ADV), influenza A (FluA), influenza B (FluB) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)) from electronic healthcare records in Children’s Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine during the COVID-19 outbreak (January–April, 2020), compared with those in 2018 and 2019 during the same periods. RESULTS: We found that outpatient visits in January, 2020 was comparable with those in 2018 and 2019, but decreased by 59.9% (288,003 vs. 717,983) and 57.4% (288,003 vs. 676,704), respectively during the period of February-April, 2020, as compared with the same periods in 2018 and 2019. The total number of respiratory tract infections from January to April 2020 decreased by 65.7% (119,532 vs.348,762) and 59.0% (119,532 vs.291,557), respectively compared with the same periods in 2018 and 2019. The proportion of respiratory tract infections during the outbreak also dropped compared with the same periods in 2018 and 2019 (P<0.001). We also found significantly decreased number of completed tests for respiratory viruses and positive cases of ADV, FluA, FluB, and RSV during February-April, 2020. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we found that outpatient visits and respiratory tract infections in children significantly decreased during COVID-19 outbreak.

The effect of accidental intravenous injection of this vaccine on the heart is unknown. METHODS: We compared the clinical manifestations, histopathological changes, tissue mRNA expression and serum levels of cytokine/chemokine in Balb/c mice at different time points after intravenous(IV) or intramuscular(IM) vaccine injection with normal saline(NS) control. RESULTS: Though significant weight loss and higher serum cytokine/chemokine levels were found in IM group at 1 to 2 days post-injection(dpi), only IV group developed histopathological changes of myopericarditis as evidenced by cardiomyocyte degeneration, apoptosis and necrosis with adjacent inflammatory cell infiltration and calcific deposits on visceral pericardium, while evidence of coronary artery or other cardiac pathologies was absent. SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen expression by immunostaining was occasionally found in infiltrating immune cells of the heart or injection site, in cardiomyocytes and intracardiac vascular endothelial cells, but not skeletal myocytes. The histological changes of myopericarditis after the first IV-priming dose persisted for 2 weeks and were markedly aggravated by a second IM- or IV-booster dose. Cardiac tissue mRNA expression of IL-1β, IFN-β, IL-6 and TNF-α increased significantly from 1dpi to 2dpi in IV but not IM group, compatible with presence of myopericarditis in IV group. Ballooning degeneration of hepatocytes was consistently found in IV group. All other organs appeared normal. CONCLUSIONS: This study provided in-vivo evidence that inadvertent intravenous injection of COVID-19 mRNA-vaccines may induce myopericarditis. Brief withdrawal of syringe plunger to exclude blood aspiration may be one possible way to reduce such risk.","Li, Can; Chen, Yanxia; Zhao, Yan; Lung, David Christopher; Ye, Zhanhong; Song, Wenchen; Liu, Fei-Fei; Cai, Jian-Piao; Wong, Wan-Man; Yip, Cyril Chik-Yan; Chan, Jasper Fuk-Woo; To, Kelvin Kai-Wang; Sridhar, Siddharth; Hung, Ivan Fan-Ngai; Chu, Hin; Kok, Kin-Hang; Jin, Dong-Yan; Zhang, Anna Jinxia; Yuen, Kwok-Yung",Clin Infect Dis,425,16

Pregnant young women with low incomes have disproportionately high rates of inadequate fruit and vegetable consumption as well as excess weight gains during pregnancy. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to describe the feasibility and acceptability of Special Delivery, a longitudinal nutrition intervention that delivers healthy foods to pregnant youth (aged 14-24 years) with low incomes. METHODS: The Special Delivery pilot study, conducted in Michigan, enrolled pregnant young women with low incomes. Study participants were sent twice-monthly grocery deliveries consisting of US $35 worth of healthy foods, primarily fruits and vegetables. Between grocery deliveries, participants received daily SMS text message prompts to confirm receipt of delivery and document diet and weight. Program feasibility was assessed by the number of grocery orders placed, delivered, and confirmed by participants. Qualitative interviews and SMS text message data were used to determine acceptability by assessing participants’ perspectives on grocery delivery, participants’ perspectives on dietary impact of the program, and foods consumed by participants. RESULTS: A total of 27 participants were enrolled in the pilot study. The mean age was 20.3 years (SD 2.0), and 59.3% (16/27) were African American or Black. During the pilot, 263 deliveries were sent with 98.5% (259/263) successful deliveries and 89.4% (235/263) deliveries confirmed by participants. Participants reported that grocery delivery was convenient; that delivered foods were high quality; and that the program improved their diet, increased access to healthy foods, and promoted healthy habits during pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: A grocery delivery–based weight gain and nutrition intervention is both feasible and acceptable among low-income pregnant youth. Grocery deliveries were successfully completed and participants were willing and able to receive grocery deliveries, eat the healthy foods that were delivered, and communicate via SMS text message with study coordinators. The Special Delivery program warrants further evaluation for efficacy in promoting healthy weight gain for low-income youth during pregnancy.","Locher, Ione; Waselewski, Marika; Sonneville, Kendrin; Resnicow, Ken; Chang, Tammy",JMIR Form Res,425,16

The high morbidity and mortality rates associated with infection and lack of licensed antiviral therapies make the henipaviruses a potential biological threat to humans and livestock. Henipavirus entry is initiated by the attachment of the G envelope glycoprotein to host cell membrane receptors. Previously, henipavirus-neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies (hmAb) have been isolated using the HeV-G glycoprotein and a human naïve antibody library. One cross-reactive and receptor-blocking hmAb (m102.4) was recently demonstrated to be an effective post-exposure therapy in two animal models of NiV and HeV infection, has been used in several people on a compassionate use basis, and is currently in development for use in humans. Here, we report the crystal structure of the complex of HeV-G with m102.3, an m102.4 derivative, and describe NiV and HeV escape mutants.

The epidemiological situation of national importance required infection control measures with the aim of reducing morbidity and mortality. An overburdening of the healthcare system should be avoided. The measures taken to combat the pandemic have had an impact on public and private life. Patients suffering from chronic pain have also been greatly affected. QUESTION: Which impact on their care do patients with chronic pain experience? METHOD: After multimodal inpatient treatment 70 pain patients were interviewed by telephone in a standardized fashion. They were asked about their condition as follows: did the changes due to the pandemic result in an increase in pain levels, a deterioration in mood and did the pandemic have a negative impact on the supply of pain medication? RESULTS: Changes in the biopsychosocial area were experienced by the patients and affected their overall well-being. Chronically ill pain patients were particularly affected by the lockdown. A large number of patients associated a deterioration in mood and aggravation of the chronic pain with measures resulting from the pandemic. The mood deterioration was clearly associated (70% of respondents). An increase in pain was associated with changes caused by the pandemic in 44% of respondents. Of the patients 39% reported a deterioration of the pain management. The measures taken to combat the pandemic have had and still have an impact on the lives of chronically ill pain patients. DISCUSSION: It is necessary to maintain the limited but still existing options of coordinated care for pain patients following a multimodal inpatient stay, even in difficult situations. The negative effects of a reduction in medical care are an argument in favor of multimodal outpatient care, especially after inpatient treatment.","Cegla, Thomas H.; Magner, Astrid",Schmerz,425,8

However, the criteria for defining a TO have not been rigorously defined and patient perspectives on the characteristics of TO are unknown. METHODS: Patients who underwent major abdominal surgery at a single tertiary care center were administered a customized survey designed to ascertain their perspectives on defining TOs. The relationship between patient-reported and clinically defined TO rates was compared. RESULTS: Among 79 patients who underwent gastrointestinal (51%), pancreatic (29%), hepatic (18%), or other major abdominal (3%) operations, 57% were female and 86% had an ASA class ≥3. Most patients underwent surgery for malignancy (87%) with 60% undergoing an open operation. Patients most commonly valued no mortality following surgery (96%), no reoperation (75%), and having a margin negative resection (73%) as “extremely important.” In contrast, those outcomes that were most commonly valued as “not important at all” or “minimally important” were receiving a blood transfusion (24%) and not having any complications (13%). Using previously published criteria for TOs, 47 (60%) patients were classified as having a clinically defined TO; in contrast, 68 patients (86%) self-reported their outcome was textbook. Self-reported responses were concordant with clinically defined TO criteria 63% of the time (McNemar’s test: S=15.2, p<0.01, evidence of disagreement). CONCLUSION: There was significant discordance between patient-reported versus clinically defined measures of TOs, suggesting patients value other considerations beyond traditional factors when evaluating the success of their surgery.

We evaluated implementation of a POCT platform at a large, acute care hospital in the Midwestern United States. METHODS: We used lactate testing as part of a sepsis bundle protocol to evaluate compliance and mortality outcomes. Respiratory team members were surveyed to assess perception of efficiency, ease of use, timely patient care, and overall engagement with the POCT system. Annualized cost per test of a benchtop analyzer and a POCT platform were compared across 3 years for each platform. RESULTS: Lactate testing volume increased from 61% to 91%, which was associated with improved sepsis bundle protocol compliance. Employees reported high levels of engagement, improvements in efficiency and time savings, and better patient care with POCT. Average cost per test was $10.02 for the benchtop system and $6.21 for the POCT platform. POCT saved our institution $88,476 annually in labor costs. DISCUSSION: Combined with a robust training program emphasizing the use of lactate testing in the context of the overall clinical picture, POCT enabled adherence to the sepsis bundle protocol and may have contributed to lower mortality. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has provided us with unanticipated benefits of using POCT; it has enhanced our ability to deal with stringent infectious disease protocols, saving time and minimizing patient and staff exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of a POCT platform was associated with improved compliance to our sepsis protocol, reduced sepsis mortality, high employee engagement, and cost savings.","Chase, Robert A.; DeJuilio, Patricia A.; Huml, Jeffrey P.; Johnson, Alex P.; Kaminski, Ryan M.",Can J Respir Ther,425,1

Methods An open-label parallel randomized controlled trial was performed among healthy migrant workers quarantined in a large multi-storey dormitory in Singapore. Forty clusters (each defined as individual floors of the dormitory) were randomly assigned to receive a 42-day prophylaxis regimen of either oral hydroxychloroquine (400 mg once, followed by 200 mg/day), oral ivermectin (12 mg once), povidone-iodine throat spray (3 times/day, 270 µg/day), oral zinc (80 mg/day)/vitamin C (500 mg/day) combination, or oral vitamin C, 500 mg/day. The primary outcome was laboratory evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection as shown by either: (1) a positive serologic test for SARS-CoV-2 antibody on day 42, or (2) a positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 at any time between baseline and day 42. Results A total of 3,037 asymptomatic participants (mean age, 33.0 years; all men) who were seronegative to SARS-CoV-2 at baseline were included in the primary analysis. Follow-up was nearly complete (99.6%). Compared with vitamin C, significant absolute risk reductions (%, 98.75% confidence interval) were observed for oral hydroxychloroquine (21%, 2–42%) and povidone-iodine throat spray (24%, 7–39%). No statistically significant differences were observed with oral zinc/vitamin C combination (23%, –5 to +41%) and ivermectin (5%, –10 to +22%). Interruptions due to side effects were highest among participants who received zinc/vitamin C combination (6.9%), followed by vitamin C (4.7%), povidone-iodine (2.0%) and hydroxychloroquine (0.7%). Conclusions Chemoprophylaxis with either oral hydroxychloroquine or povidone-iodine throat spray was superior to oral vitamin C in reducing SARS-CoV-2 infection in young and healthy men.

Mapping viral transmission within and between facilities by combining genomic sequencing with epidemiologic investigations enables targeting infection-control interventions. METHODS: We conducted weekly surveillance of residents and staff in LTCFs in Santa Clara County, California, with ≥1 confirmed COVID-19 case between March and July 2020. Positive samples were referred for whole-genome sequencing. Epidemiological investigations and phylogenetic analyses of the largest outbreaks (>30 cases) were carried out in 6 LTCFs (Facilities A through F). RESULTS: Among the 61 LTCFs in the county, 41 had ≥1 confirmed case during the study period, triggering weekly SARS-CoV-2 testing. The 6 largest outbreaks accounted for 60% of cases and 90% of deaths in LTCFs, although the bed capacity of these facilities represents only 11% of the LTCF beds in the county. Phylogenetic analysis of 196 whole-genome sequences recovered from those facilities showed that each outbreak was monophyletic, with staff and residents sharing a common viral lineage. Outbreak investigations revealed that infected staff members often worked at multiple facilities, and in 1 instance, a staff member infected while working in 1 facility was the likely index case in another. CONCLUSIONS: We detected a pattern of rapid and sustained transmission after a single introduction of SARS-CoV-2 in 6 large LTCF outbreaks, with staff playing a key role in transmission within and between facilities. Infection control, testing, and occupational policies to reduce exposure and transmission risk for staff are essential components to keeping facility residents safe.","MacCannell, Tara; Batson, Joshua; Bonin, Brandon; Astha, K C; Quenelle, Rebecca; Strong, Betsy; Lin, Wen; Rudman, Sarah L; Dynerman, David; Ayscue, Patrick; Han, George; Kistler, Amy; Villarino, Margarita Elsa",Clin Infect Dis,425,1

METHODS: We performed a prospective cohort study (2009–2014) in all consecutive adult patients (≥18 years) undergoing lung transplantation in the Hospital Universitari Vall d’Hebron (Barcelona, Spain). We systematically collected nasopharyngeal swabs from asymptomatic patients during seasonal changes, from patients with upper respiratory tract infectious disease, lower respiratory tract infectious disease (LRTID), or acute rejection. Nasopharyngeal swabs were analyzed by multiplex polymerase chain reaction. Primary outcome was to evaluate the potential association of CARVs and development of CLAD. Time-dependent Cox regression models were performed to identify the independent risk factors for CLAD. RESULTS: Overall, 98 patients (67 bilateral lung transplant recipients; 63.3% male; mean age, 49.9 years) were included. Mean postoperative follow-up was 3.4 years (interquartile range [IQR], 2.5–4.0 years). Thirty-eight lung transplant recipients (38.8%) developed CLAD, in a median time of 20.4 months (IQR, 12–30.4 months). In time-controlled multivariate analysis, CARV-LRTID (hazard ratio [HR], 3.00 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.52–5.91]; P = .002), acute rejection (HR, 2.97 [95% CI, 1.51–5.83]; P = .002), and cytomegalovirus pneumonitis (HR, 3.76 [95% CI, 1.23–11.49]; P = .02) were independent risk factors associated with developing CLAD.

A nucleocapsid protein (NP)‐based enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) detection method is not only important in disease diagnosis, but is required for the evaluation of vaccine efficacy during the development of an inactivated SARS‐CoV‐2 vaccine. In this study, we expressed both the NP and N‐terminally truncated NP (ΔN‐NP) of SARS‐CoV‐2 in an Escherichia coli expression system, and described the purification of the soluble recombinant NP and ΔN‐NP in details. The identities of the NP and ΔN‐NP were confirmed with mass spectrometry. We then used IgG detection ELISAs to compare the sensitivity of NP and ΔN‐NP in detecting anti‐SARS‐CoV‐2 antibodies. ΔN‐NP showed greater sensitivity than NP in the analysis of serially diluted sera from mice and rabbits vaccinated with inactive SARS‐CoV‐2 and in human sera diluted 1:400. ΔN‐NP showed a positive detection rate similar to that of the SARS‐CoV‐2 S protein in human sera. We conclude that ΔN‐NP is a better serological marker than NP for evaluating the immunogenicity of inactivated SARS‐CoV‐2. This article is protected by copyright.

Mayhem wrecked by frequent lockdowns, curfews, emergencies, etc. has stoked the high quantum of chaotic movement in equity markets and resulted in perplexed investor behaviour. It, therefore, is of paramount practical relevance to measure predictability of market fear at such a crucial juncture of time. Market fear can effectively be measured in terms of implied and historic volatility of equity markets. The present study chooses India VIX and 20-day rolling standard deviation of NIFTY returns to account for implied and historic volatility respectively during the ongoing COVID-19 timeline. Pertinent macroeconomic constructs, technical indicators and Google search volume index on meaningful keywords have been chosen as raw explanatory features for inspecting predictability. Boruta feature selection methodology has been used in a supervised manner to select significant features. State-Of-The-Art machine and deep learning algorithms namely Gradient Boosting (GB), Extra Tree Regression (ERT), Deep Neural Network (DNN), Long Short Term Memory Network (LSTM) are then used on processed feature set to scrupulously evaluate the quantum of predictability of said assets. The integrated predictive frameworks have been subjected to a battery of numerical and statistical checks to draw inferences. Additionally, Explainable AI frameworks have been used to analyse the nature of influence of respective features. Findings indeed suggest that despite exhibiting high degree of volatile traits, both India VIX and historic volatility can be predicted utilizing the proposed architectures effectively and serve practical actionable insights.","Ghosh, Indranil; Sanyal, Manas K.",International Journal of Information Management Data Insights,425,28

Was it responsible for the defeat of incumbent President Donald Trump? The present study makes an initial attempt at, and provides a model for, understanding the pandemic’s influence on Trump support. The study employed a mixed experimental and correlational design and surveyed separate samples of adults (N = 1,763) in six waves beginning March 23, 2020 and ending June 1, 2020. Participants were randomly assigned to report their Trump support either before or after being reminded of the pandemic with a series of questions gauging their level of concern about it. Results revealed complex and dynamic effects that changed over time. Depending on survey wave, the pandemic seems to have lowered Trump support among Democrats, while (marginally) raising it among independents. Republicans’ reactions also changed over time; of particular note, Republicans who were more concerned about the pandemic reported higher Trump support after being reminded of the pandemic in its early stages, but this effect reversed by the time the economy began reopening (coinciding with a dip in Trump’s approval ratings). Although the correlational results in the present study did not converge neatly with the experimental results, the combined experimental and correlational approach has the potential to increase researchers’ confidence in the causal effects of salient national and international events on political attitudes.","Hart, Joshua",PLoS One,425,16

Considering the relevance of present circumstances, we explored perceptions and attitudes of community members towards their mental well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic. SETTING: We conducted an exploratory qualitative study using a purposive sampling approach, at two communities of Karachi, Pakistan. PARTICIPANTS: In-depth interviews were conducted with community members including, young adults, middle-aged adults and older adults of both genders. Study data were analysed manually using the thematic analysis technique. PRIMARY OUTCOME: The primary outcome is assessing community perception towards their mental well-being amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: A total of 27 in-depth interviews were conducted, between May and June 2020. Three overarching themes were identified: (1) impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of the general communities; (2) current coping mechanisms to adapt to the new reality and (3) recommendations to address the mental health of communities. Generally, community members underwent increased anxiety and fear due to the contagious nature of the virus. Alongside, social, financial and religious repercussions of the pandemic have also heightened psychological distress among community members. However, community members were able to point out some of the coping mechanisms such as getting closer to God, connecting with family, participating in mental health sessions and resetting lives by indulging in diverse activities. Simultaneously, they also recommended the need for remote mental health services for elders and continuous efforts by the government to address the mental health needs of the community. CONCLUSION: COVID-19-associated mental health consequences have hit every individual in society. The study finding has the potential to guide the development of context-specific innovative mental health programmes to overcome the pandemic repercussions.","Ali, Naureen Akber; Feroz, Anam Shahil; Akber, Noshaba; Feroz, Rida; Nazim Meghani, Salima; Saleem, Sarah",BMJ Open,425,20

Data informing whether immune-mediated medications lead to more severe infection are sparse. OBJECTIVE: Determine whether outpatient immunosuppressive therapies that treat autoimmune inflammatory disease or prevent solid organ transplant rejection are associated with severe illness after diagnosis with SARS-CoV-2 DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study PARTICIPANTS: Adults with a positive PCR nasal swab for SARS-CoV-2 from February 25 to September 9, 2020, cared for within a large integrated health care organization MAIN MEASURES: Exposure was defined as an outpatient fill of prednisone, immunomodulator, small-molecule, or biologic therapy in the 105 days prior to a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test. The main outcome was either hospitalization, ICU admission, or death within 45 days after diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. Multivariable logistic regression models were adjusted for age, race, gender, body mass index, comorbidities, and autoimmune disease. KEY RESULTS: A total of 39,686 adults had a positive PCR test. In the primary analysis, prior prednisone use was associated with severe illness after diagnosis with SARS-CoV-2 (odds ratio (OR) 1.31; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08–1.60); however, immunomodulator (OR 0.88; 95% CI 0.57–1.34) and biologic/small-molecule therapy (OR 1.26; 95% CI 0.79–2.00) were not. Secondary analyses showed variable risk among therapies: Janus-kinase inhibitors had an increased odds of severe illness (OR 3.35; 95% CI 1.16–9.67), thiopurines/conventionaldisease-modifying antirheumatic drugs had a reduced odds (OR 0.53; 95% CI 0.32–0.88), and tumor necrosis factor inhibitors were not associated (OR 0.45; 95% CI 0.18–1.08). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Outpatient use of prednisone is associated with severe illness after diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. Immunomodulator and biologic/small-molecule therapy were not associated, but different risk subgroups were identified. Our findings can inform risk-benefit discussions in the clinic and risk-based recommendations for patients on these therapies.

Sixty patients (median age IQR, 65 (52–69), 43 males), hospitalized for COVID-19 at Siena COVID Unit University Hospital, were prospectively enrolled. Twenty-six patients were selected (median age IQR, 63 (55–71), 16 males); all of them underwent follow-up evaluations, including clinical, radiological, functional, and serum KL-6 assessments, after 6 (t1) and 9 (t2) months from hospital discharge. At t0, KL-6 concentrations were significantly higher than those at t1 (760 (311–1218) vs. 309 (210–408) p = 0.0208) and t2 (760 (311–1218) vs 324 (279–458), p = 0.0365). At t0, KL-6 concentrations were increased in patients with fibrotic lung alterations than in non-fibrotic group (755 (370–1023) vs. 305 (225–608), p = 0.0225). Area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) analysis showed that basal KL-6 levels showed good accuracy in discriminating patients with fibrotic sequelae radiologically documented (AUC 85%, p = 0.0404). KL-6 concentrations in patients with fibrotic involvement were significantly reduced at t1 (755 (370–1023) vs. 290 (197–521), p = 0.0366) and t2 (755 (370–1023) vs. 318 (173–435), p = 0.0490).

This finding led to a concern for the implications of potential delays in care for the obstetric population. HYPOTHESIS/PROBLEM: This study examines the impact of the pandemic on prehospital care amongst pregnant women. METHODS: A retrospective observational study was conducted comparing obstetric-related EMS activations in Maryland (USA) during the pandemic (March 10-July 20, 2020) to a pre-pandemic period (March 10-July 20, 2019). Comparative analysis was used to analyze the difference in frequency and acuity of calls between the two periods. RESULTS: There were fewer obstetric-related EMS encounters during the pandemic compared to the year prior (daily average during the pandemic 12.5 [SD = 3.8] versus 14.6 [SD = 4.1] pre-pandemic; P <.001), although the percent of total female encounters remained unchanged (1.6% in 2020 versus 1.5% in 2019; P = .091). Key indicators of maternal status were not significantly different between the two periods. African-American women represented a disproportionately high percentage of obstetric-related activations (36.2% in 2019 and 34.8% in 2020). CONCLUSIONS: In this state-wide analysis of EMS calls in Maryland early in the pandemic, no significant differences existed in the utilization of EMS by pregnant women. Prehospital EMS activations amongst pregnant women in Maryland only decreased slightly without an increase in acuity. Of note, over-representation by African-American women compared to population statistics raises concern for broader systemic differences in access to obstetric care.","Hadley, Megan E.; Vaught, Arthur J.; Margolis, Asa M.; Chizmar, Timothy P.; Alemayehu, Teferra; Halscott, Torre; Jenkins, J.

Proteolytic cleavages of the spike S protein of SARS-CoV-2, mediated by the host cell proteases cathepsin and TMPRSS2, alone or in combination, are key early activation steps required for efficient infection. The PIKfyve kinase inhibitor apilimod interferes with late endosomal viral traffic, and through an ill-defined mechanism prevents in vitro infection through late endosomes mediated by cathepsin. Similarly, inhibition of TMPRSS2 protease activity by camostat mesylate or nafamostat mesylate prevents infection mediated by the TMPRSS2-dependent and cathepsin-independent pathway. Here, we combined the use of apilimod with camostat mesylate or nafamostat mesylate and found an unexpected ~5–10 fold increase in their effectiveness to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection in different cell types. Comparable synergism was observed using both, a chimeric vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) containing S of SARS-CoV-2 (VSV-SARS-CoV-2) and SARS-CoV-2 virus. The substantial ~5 fold or more decrease of half maximal effective concentrations (EC(50) values) suggests a plausible treatment strategy based on the combined use of these inhibitors.","Kreutzberger, Alex J.B.; Sanyal, Anwesha; Ojha, Ravi; Pyle, Jesse D.; Vapalahti, Olli; Balistreri, Giuseppe; Kirchhausen, Tom",bioRxiv,425,18

We assessed the effects of IVM in SARS-CoV-2-intranasally-inoculated golden Syrian hamsters. Even though ivermectin had no effect on viral load, SARS-Cov-2-associated pathology was greatly attenuated. IVM had a sex-dependent and compartmentalized immunomodulatory effect, preventing clinical deterioration and reducing olfactory deficit in infected animals. Importantly, ivermectin dramatically reduced the Il-6/Il-10 ratio in lung tissue, which likely accounts for the more favorable clinical presentation in treated animals.

Acrosome reaction (AR) was suppressed in the presence of aminopeptidase substrate, Phe‐4‐methylcoumaryl‐7‐amide (MCA), and an aminopeptidase inhibitor, bestatin. Treatment of sperm with phosphatidylinositol‐specific phospholipase C (PI‐PLC) released aminopeptidase activity from sperm and suppressed AR. These results suggest that the enzyme is located on the sperm surface via glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)‐anchor and is involved in the AR. Immunoblot analysis showed that tyrosine residues of 40, 59, 68, and 72 kDa proteins were phosphorylated during induction of the AR. The 40 kDa protein was also recognized by anti‐c‐Src antibody by immunoblotting. The tyrosine phosphorylation of these proteins was inhibited when sperm were inseminated in the presence of Phe‐MCA, and by PI‐PLC treatment. Treatment of sperm with tyrosine kinase activator, 9,10‐dimethyl‐1,2‐benzanthracene, induced AR, and its inhibitor, genistein, suppressed AR.

The identification of occupational groups most at risk of exposure is critical in contrasting and preventing the epidemic diffusion. OBJECTIVE: To analyse the compensation claim applications collected by the Italian Workers’ Compensation Authority (INAIL) for identifying the occupational patterns and the temporal trend, in comparison with general population data. METHODS: Daily time series of compensation claim applications for COVID-19 injuries in the period March-October 2020, has been analysed, estimating the epidemiological parameters of interest and comparing findings with general population data. RESULTS: In the period March-October 2020, 65,804 compensation claim applications for COVID-19 have been collected by INAIL. The ratio between compensation claims applications and COVID-19 cases in the general population appears decreasing in the period, passing from 20% in the first pandemic period (March-April) to 3-4% in the September-October period. During the summer period, an increase in male and not Italian component and a decrease in mean age, Northern regions, and health care workers contributions to the occupational claims applications have been observed. DISCUSSION: The comparative analyses between occupational and general population data allowed to describe how the so called “second wave” of COVID-19 epidemic in Italy involved the occupational settings less than the other risk factors. There is a need to go towards an occupational surveillance system for COVID-19 infection, with the aim of monitoring and preventing the occupational risk of infection, supporting insurance system effectiveness and managing vaccination policies.","Marinaccio, Alessandro; Brusco, Adelina; Bucciarelli, Andrea; D’Amario, Silvia; Iavicoli, Sergio",Med Lav,425,20

A minority makes little detectable antibody, generally those with either very mild/asymptomatic disease or those with severe/lethal infection. However, in general, antibody titre correlates with viral load and duration of exposure. There is evidence for cross-reactivity with the other human coronaviruses, though the functional impact of this is as yet unclear. Therapeutic use of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies offers potential for clinical use. While there is evidence for neutralizing antibody as a correlate of protection, some cases indicate the potential for full recovery in the absence of antibody. Studies of T-cell immunity following acute infection show CD4 and CD8 responses to epitopes across diverse viral antigens, possible cross-reactivity with epitopes from the common cold human coronaviruses and large-scale activation. However, in severe cases, there is evidence for T-cell lymphopaenia as well as expression of exhaustion markers. Analysis of serum biomarkers of disease severity implicates a hyperinflammatory contribution to pathogenesis, though this has not been mechanistically delineated beyond a likely role of raised IL-6, considered a therapeutic target. Despite rapid progress, there remain pressing unknowns. It seems likely that immune memory to SARS-CoV-2 may be relatively short lived, but this will need longitudinal investigation. Also, this is a disease of highly variable presentation and time course, with some progressing to protracted, chronic symptoms, which are not understood. The contribution of immunopathological mechanisms to tissue damage, whether in the lung, kidney, heart or blood vessels, is unclear. The immunology underlying the differential susceptibility between the very young and the very old is unresolved, a question with ramifications for vaccine roll-out. The greatest challenge relates to rapid generation, testing and manufacture of vaccines that are immunogenic, protective (at least from symptomatic disease) and safe—a challenge that looks achievable.","Altmann, Daniel M",Oxf Open Immunol,425,1

Prion infectivity may enter soil environments via shedding from diseased animals and decomposition of infected carcasses. Burial of TSE-infected cattle, sheep, and deer as a means of disposal has resulted in unintentional introduction of prions into subsurface environments. We examined the potential for soil to serve as a TSE reservoir by studying the interaction of the disease-associated prion protein (PrP(Sc)) with common soil minerals. In this study, we demonstrated substantial PrP(Sc) adsorption to two clay minerals, quartz, and four whole soil samples. We quantified the PrP(Sc)-binding capacities of each mineral. Furthermore, we observed that PrP(Sc) desorbed from montmorillonite clay was cleaved at an N-terminal site and the interaction between PrP(Sc) and Mte was strong, making desorption of the protein difficult. Despite cleavage and avid binding, PrP(Sc) bound to Mte remained infectious. Results from our study suggest that PrP(Sc) released into soil environments may be preserved in a bioavailable form, perpetuating prion disease epizootics and exposing other species to the infectious agent.","Johnson, Christopher J; Phillips, Kristen E; Schramm, Peter T; McKenzie, Debbie; Aiken, Judd M; Pedersen, Joel A",PLoS Pathog,425,15

They allow for computational case studies on non-pharmaceutical interventions thereby providing an important basis for policy makers. While research is ongoing on the transmission dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, it is important to come up with epidemic models that can describe the main stages of the progression of the associated COVID-19 respiratory disease. We propose an age-stratified discrete compartment model as an alternative to differential equation based S-I-R type of models. The model captures the highly age-dependent progression of COVID-19 and is able to describe the day-by-day advancement of an infected individual in a modern health care system. The fully-identified model for Switzerland not only predicts the overall histories of the number of infected, hospitalized and deceased, but also the corresponding age-distributions. The model-based analysis of the outbreak reveals an average infection fatality ratio of 0.4% with a pronounced maximum of 9.5% for those aged ≥ 80 years. The predictions for different scenarios of relaxing the soft lockdown indicate a low risk of overloading the hospitals through a second wave of infections. However, there is a hidden risk of a significant increase in the total fatalities (by up to 200%) in case schools reopen with insufficient containment measures in place.","Balabdaoui, Fadoua; Mohr, Dirk",Sci Rep,425,30

Whereas the traditional post-occupancy evaluations (POEs) of buildings have typically focussed on investigating users' satisfaction, an earlier study developed the gap theory based post-occupancy evaluation (GTbPOE) method, by which both the users' expectation and satisfaction (viz. performance gap) of a university dormitory were investigated. To validate the applicability of the GTbPOE method, further research was undertaken to evaluate the building performance of another dormitory. Using face-to-face interviews, responses of 104 dormitory users were collected, of which the relative importance ratings of six essential aspects (namely: visual comfort, thermal comfort, aural comfort, fire safety, hygiene, and communication via information technology) were analyzed via the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). A series of gap analyses on the users' expectation and satisfaction levels corroborated the existence of the adaptation effect on the users’ perception: that is, the longer the stay, the smaller the performance gap. A comparative analysis on the findings between the two dormitories - one from the earlier study and the other from the present study - further demonstrated the usefulness of the GTbPOE method in benchmarking building performance. Adoption of this method in future POE studies will enable reliable identification of any shortcoming in building performance and hence, can form the basis for improvement measures to augment the performance of buildings within the built environment.","Hou, Huiying (Cynthia); Lai, Joseph H.K.; Edwards, David",Build Environ,425,1

A resurgence of coronavirus infections has been confirmed in most countries, resulting in a second wave of the deadly virus. The infectious virus has symptoms ranging from an itchy throat to Pneumonia, resulting in the loss of thousands of human lives while globally infecting millions. Detecting the presence of COVID-19 as early as possible is critical, as it helps prevent further spread of disease and helps isolate and provide treatment to the infected patients. Recent radiological imaging findings confirm that lung X-ray and CT scans provide an excellent indication of the progression of COVID-19 infection in acute symptomatic carriers. This investigation aims to rapidly detect COVID-19 progression and non-COVID Pneumonia from lung X-ray images of heavily symptomatic patients. A novel and highly efficient COVID-DeepNet model is presented for the accurate and rapid prediction of COVID-19 infection using state-of-the-art Artificial Intelligence techniques. The proposed model provides a multi-class classification of lung X-ray images into COVID-19, non-COVID Pneumonia, and normal (healthy). The proposed systems’ performance is assessed based on the evaluation metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, precision, and f1 score. The current research employed a dataset size of 7500 X-ray samples. The high recognition accuracy of 99.67% was observed for the proposed COVID-DeepNet model, and it complies with the most recent state-of-the-art. The proposed COVID-DeepNet model is highly efficient and accurate, and it can assist radiologists and doctors in the early clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 infection for symptomatic patients.","Panthakkan, Alavikunhu; Anzar, S.M.; Mansoori, Saeed Al; Ahmad, Hussain Al",Biomed Signal Process Control,425,8

The comparison of attitudes towards CS between dental and medical students based on the taught curriculum (problem-based learning vs. traditional teaching) in Saudi Arabia awaits investigation. Aims: (1) To assess the attitudes of both undergraduate dental and medical students towards communication skills (CS) learning and (2) to compare the attitudes towards CS between Medical and Dental students in relation to sociodemographic and education-related characteristics. Methods and Materials: A cross-sectional study, using an online survey, invited 260 conveniently sampled Taibah university medical and dental undergraduate students. The survey collected data on sociodemographic characteristics, education-related factors, and CS using Communication Skills Attitude Scale (CSAS) that assess positive and negative attitudes (PAS, NAS). Data analysis included descriptive statistics and the Mann–Whitney U test. Results: Of the distributed questionnaire 91% responded (145 dental and 91 medical students).

This study provides a brief and precise review of the current knowledge regarding COVID-19, including disease transmission, clinical characteristics, diagnosis, and potential treatment. The article focused on COVID-19-related information useful in otolaryngologist practice. METHODS: The Medline and Web of Science databases were searched without a time limit using terms “COVID-19”, “SARS-CoV-2” in conjunction with “otorhinolaryngological manifestation”, “ENT”, and “olfaction”. RESULTS: The most common otolaryngological dysfunctions of COVID-19 were cough, sore throat, and dyspnea. Rhinorrhea, nasal congestion and dizziness were also present. COVID-19 could manifest as an isolated sudden hyposmia/anosmia. Upper respiratory tract (URT) symptoms were commonly observed in younger patients and usually appeared initially. They could be present even before the molecular confirmation of SARS-CoV-2. Otolaryngologists are of great risk of becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2 as they cope with URT. ENT surgeons could be easily infected by SARS-CoV-2 during performing surgery in COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSION: Ear, nose and throat (ENT) symptoms may precede the development of severe COVID-19. During COVID-19 pandemic, patients with cough, sore throat, dyspnea, hyposmia/anosmia and a history of travel to the region with confirmed COVID-19 patients, should be considered as potential COVID-19 cases. An otolaryngologist should wear FFP3/N95 mask, glasses, disposable and fluid resistant gloves and gown while examining such individuals. Not urgent ENT surgeries should be postponed. Additional studies analyzing why some patients develop ENT symptoms during COVID-19 and others do not are needed. Further research is needed to determine the mechanism leading to anosmia.","Krajewska, Joanna; Krajewski, Wojciech; Zub, Krzysztof; Zatoński, Tomasz",Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol,425,20

Although this class of therapy has demonstrated impressive clinical efficacy against cancers that were once thought to be incurable, its success is in part limited by unique toxicities which can be severe or even fatal. Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is the most commonly observed toxicity and occurs as a result of non-antigen specific immune activation. Similar to macrophage activation syndrome (MAS)/hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), CRS is associated with elevated levels of several cytokines including interleukin-6 (IL-6) that serve as a driver for host immune dysregulation. As a direct anti-cytokine drug, tocilizumab has been a cornerstone in the treatment of CAR-T-associated CRS through its ability to dampen CRS without compromising CAR-T-cell function.

METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of peer-reviewed papers indexed in PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science and pre-prints in Europe PMC through August 12 (th), 2020 that described cases of human transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Reports of other respiratory virus transmission were included for reference. RESULTS: Five identified studies found that a low proportion of reported global SARS-CoV-2 infections have occurred outdoors (<10%) and the odds of indoor transmission was very high compared to outdoors (18.7 times; 95% CI 6.0, 57.9). Five studies described influenza transmission outdoors and two described adenovirus transmission outdoors. There was high heterogeneity in study quality and individual definitions of outdoor settings which limited our ability to draw conclusions about outdoor transmission risks. In general, factors such as duration and frequency of personal contact, lack of personal protective equipment and occasional indoor gathering during a largely outdoor experience were associated with outdoor reports of infection. CONCLUSION: Existing evidence supports the wide-held belief that the the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission is lower outdoors but there are significant gaps in our understanding of specific pathways.","Bulfone, Tommaso Celeste; Malekinejad, Mohsen; Rutherford, George W; Razani, Nooshin",J Infect Dis,425,1

We aimed to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on psychological status, self-management behaviors, and diabetes care maintenance among Saudi adults with T1DM using insulin pump therapy. METHODS: This cross-sectional study used a web survey to collect data on Saudi adults with T1DM who were treated in the specialized insulin pump clinic at King Abdulaziz Medical City-Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. We used the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and General Anxiety Disorder-7 scales to measure depression and anxiety. RESULTS: Of the 70 patients who received the survey, 65 completed it. Overall, 23.1% and 29.2% of the patients reported moderate to severe and mild depression, respectively; 18.5% and 24.6% reported moderate to severe and mild anxiety, respectively. Compared with pre-lockdown, adherence to a healthy diet and regular physical activity decreased in 67.7% and 41.5% of the patients, respectively. Most patients maintained their adherence to insulin pump behaviors; frequent self-monitoring of blood glucose increased in 47% of glucometer users. Most patients benefited from phone visits or virtual education sessions, but 66.2% of the patients reported difficulty obtaining at least one type of insulin pump supply. CONCLUSIONS: Promoting self-management behaviors and psychological wellbeing of patients with T1DM using insulin pump therapy is crucial during a lockdown. Telemedicine is a useful alternative to in-person appointments, but strategies to ensure that patients have access to adequate resources during lockdown must be developed.","Magliah, Sultan F.; Zarif, Hawazen A.; Althubaiti, Alaa; Sabban, Mahmoud F.",Diabetes Metab Syndr,425,20

They were included if both RT-PCR result for SARS-CoV-2 and cell blood count on the day that infection was suspected were available. We calculated the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic curve. Results: 37 patients were included in the final analysis, of which 16 (43.2%) were COVID-19 positive. For the day of suspected COVID-19, total leukocytes were significantly lower in the COVID-19 positive group (4.1 vs. 7.4 G/L, p = 0.0072) and were characterized by lower neutrophils (2.7 vs. 5.1 G/L, p = 0.021) and eosinophils (0.01 vs. 0.15 G/L, p = 0.0003). Eosinophil count below 0.045 G/L identified SARS-CoV-2 infection with AUC of 0.9 [95% CI 0.81—1] (p < 0.0001), sensitivity of 82%, specificity of 86%, a positive predictive value of 82%, a negative predictive value of 86% and a likelihood ratio of 6.04. Conclusions: Eosinophil count enables rapid routine screening of symptomatic chronic hemodialysis patients suspected of being COVID-19 within a range of low or high probability.","Vial, Romain; Gully, Marion; Bobot, Mickael; Scarfoglière, Violaine; Brunet, Philippe; Bouchouareb, Dammar; Duval, Ariane; Zino, He-oh; Faraut, Julien; Jehel, Océane; Berdad-Haddad, Yaël; Burtey, Stéphane; Jarrot, Pierre-André; Lano, Guillaume; Robert, Thomas",J Clin Med,425,8

To date, the coronavirus pandemic has infected over eighty million people and has killed more than 1.78 million worldwide. This study aims to explore “how useful is Reddit social media platform to surveil COVID-19 pandemic?” and “how do people’s concerns/behaviors change over the course of COVID-19 pandemic in North Carolina?”. The purpose of this study was to compare people’s thoughts, behavior changes, discussion topics, and the number of confirmed cases and deaths by applying natural language processing (NLP) to COVID-19 related data. METHODS: In this study, we collected COVID-19 related data from 18 subreddits of North Carolina from March to August 2020. Next, we applied methods from natural language processing and machine learning to analyze collected Reddit posts using feature engineering, topic modeling, custom named-entity recognition (NER), and BERT-based (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) sentence clustering. Using these methods, we were able to glean people’s responses and their concerns about COVID-19 pandemic in North Carolina. RESULTS: We observed a positive change in attitudes towards masks for residents in North Carolina. The high-frequency words in all subreddit corpora for each of the COVID-19 mitigation strategy categories are: Distancing (DIST)—“social distance/distancing”, “lockdown”, and “work from home”; Disinfection (DIT)—“(hand) sanitizer/soap”, “hygiene”, and ""wipe""; Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)—“mask/facemask(s)/face shield”, “n95(s)/kn95”, and “cloth/gown”; Symptoms (SYM)—“death”, “flu/influenza”, and “cough/coughed”; Testing (TEST)—“cases”, “(antibody) test”, and “test results (positive/negative)”. CONCLUSION: The findings in our study show that the use of Reddit data to monitor COVID-19 pandemic in North Carolina (NC) was effective. The study shows the utility of NLP methods (e.g. cosine similarity, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling, custom NER and BERT-based sentence clustering) in discovering the change of the public's concerns/behaviors over the course of COVID-19 pandemic in NC using Reddit data. Moreover, the results show that social media data can be utilized to surveil the epidemic situation in a specific community.","Liu, Yang; Whitfield, Christopher; Zhang, Tianyang; Hauser, Amanda; Reynolds, Taeyonn; Anwar, Mohd",Health Inf Sci Syst,425,24

In Romania, prenatal education is of recent interest but there is no official information about prenatal courses and their impact on prenatal care and patients in Romania. Material and methods: A prospective study based on the STROBE statement was designed in order to assess the prenatal education delivered in our unit. The study group included women who gave birth at Bucur Maternity, “Saint. John” Hospital, Bucharest, Romania and attended the prenatal courses, compared with a control group (women who gave birth in our unit but did not attend the prenatal lecture). Patients’ perception about the impact of prenatal education was collected by applying a questionnaire. Results: The analysis included 89 women who fulfilled the questionnaire online. In our study, 62 women (69.7%) attended the prenatal education classes and represented the study group while 27 women (30.3%) constituted the control group.

However, in more vulnerable populations, such as newborns, infants, the elderly and immune-compromised individuals, these opportunistic pathogens can also affect the lower respiratory tract, leading to pneumonia, exacerbations of asthma, and various types of respiratory distress syndrome. The respiratory involvement of human coronaviruses has been clearly established since the 1960s. Nevertheless, for almost three decades now, data reported in the scientific literature has also demonstrated that, like it was described for other human viruses, coronaviruses have neuroinvasive capacities since they can spread from the respiratory tract to the central nervous system (CNS). Once there, infection of CNS cells (neurotropism) could lead to human health problems, such as encephalitis and long-term neurological diseases. Neuroinvasive coronaviruses could damage the CNS as a result of misdirected host immune responses that could be associated with autoimmunity in susceptible individuals (virus-induced neuroimmunopathology) and/or viral replication, which directly induces damage to CNS cells (virus-induced neuropathology). Given all these properties, it has been suggested that these opportunistic human respiratory pathogens could be associated with the triggering or the exacerbation of neurologic diseases for which the etiology remains poorly understood. Herein, we present host and viral factors that participate in the regulation of the possible pathogenic processes associated with CNS infection by human coronaviruses and we try to decipher the intricate interplay between virus and host target cells in order to characterize their role in the virus life cycle as well as in the capacity of the cell to respond to viral invasion.","Desforges, Marc; Le Coupanec, Alain; Stodola, Jenny K.; Meessen-Pinard, Mathieu; Talbot, Pierre J.",Virus Res,425,16

For this purpose, a magnetic device generating 7.5 T/m uniform magnetic field gradient was designed and incorporated to a commercial spectrophotometer. Different batches of colloidal superparamagnetic particles (SMPs), with different elemental compositions, were functionalized with twenty-mer complementary oligonucleotides, TB1 and TB2. When the functionalized SMPs-TB1 and SMPs-TB2 are mixed and incubated, the hybridization process of TB1 and TB2 occurs resulting in the formation of colloidal aggregates. When brought under the magnetic field, depending on the magnetic strength (Γ) of the formed aggregates, they separate either faster or slower than the non-functionalized SMPs. The difference in magnetic separation time (Δt) is optically monitored by measuring the real time transparency of the suspension at specific wavelengths. The detection of aggregates at concentrations of 0.001% w/v was achieved, showing [Formula: see text] ranging from 113−228 s. Based on the changes of Δt, the study addresses how electrosteric, magnetic, and hydrogen bonding interactions affect the hybridization process and suggests optimum experimental conditions for accurate monitoring of TB1-TB2 hybridization.","Benelmekki, Maria; Gasso, Sergi; Martinez, Lluis M.",Colloids Surf B Biointerfaces,425,1

However, it suggested, ‘local solutions’ should be sought in order to protect the delivery of cancer services. We aimed to compare surgeons’ practice for the provision of colorectal (CR) cancer surgery across the United Kingdom (UK), against updated Joint Royal Colleges & ACPGBI guidelines and highlight differences in practice, if any. METHOD: An online survey was conducted. It examined surgical practice across the UK against current protocols for CR cancer surgeries, during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: 29 individual responses were received from 23 NHS Trusts across the UK. 23/29 (79%) surgeons ceased or experienced delays in their CR cancer surgeries during the pandemic, with 3/29 (10%) yet to reintroduce these services. 19/26 (73%) surgeons instructed their patients to self-isolate prior to surgery, of which 5/19 (26%) correctly enforced a duration of 14 days. 10/19 (53%) participants adhered to guidelines of performing a CT chest within 24 h of surgery. 10/26 (38%) participants believe their patients are experiencing longer hospital admissions in the COVID-19 setting. CONCLUSION: This snap shot survey highlights the dramatic variations in CR cancer surgery practice within the UK and inconsistent adherence to protocols. Guidelines will no doubt change as our knowledge of COVID-19 increases both nationally and internationally.

In the same time, the availability of technologies should allow patients to receive the best test for the specific individual condition. This is theoretically true, when a specific test is designed for the specific disease condition, while it is difficult to implement in the setting of agnostic therapies. Financial sources availability related to the non homogeneous health systems working in the different countries do not allow for an immediate implementation of the technologies and test commercially available. Future perspectives for targeted oncology include tumor-agnostic drugs, which target a given mutation and could be used in treating cancers from multiple organ types. Therefore, the present paper is aimed to both underline a how much important is this new view and also to sensitize the international bodies that supervise health policies at the decision-making level, with the aim of harmonizing cancer treatment pathways in at least all European countries. ABSTRACT: Rapid and continuing advances in biomarker testing are not being matched by uptake in health systems, and this is hampering both patient care and innovation. It also risks costing health systems the opportunity to make their services more efficient and, over time, more economical. The potential that genomics has brought to biomarker testing in diagnosis, prediction and research is being realised, pre-eminently in many cancers, but also in an ever-wider range of conditions—notably BRCA1/2 testing in ovarian, breast, pancreatic and prostate cancers. Nevertheless, the implementation of genetic testing in clinical routine setting is still challenging. Development is impeded by country-related heterogeneity, data deficiencies, and lack of policy alignment on standards, approval—and the role of real-world evidence in the process—and reimbursement. The acute nature of the problem is compellingly illustrated by the particular challenges facing the development and use of tumour agnostic therapies, where the gaps in preparedness for taking advantage of this innovative approach to cancer therapy are sharply exposed. Europe should already have in place a guarantee of universal access to a minimum suite of biomarker tests and should be planning for an optimum testing scenario with a wider range of biomarker tests integrated into a more sophisticated health system articulated around personalised medicine. Improving healthcare and winning advantages for Europe’s industrial competitiveness and innovation require an appropriate policy framework—starting with an update to outdated recommendations. We show herein the main issues and proposals that emerged during the previous advisory boards organised by the European Alliance for Personalized Medicine which mainly focus on possible scenarios of harmonisation of both oncogenetic testing and management of cancer patients.","Horgan, Denis; Ciliberto, Gennaro; Conte, Pierfranco; Curigliano, Giuseppe; Seijo, Luis; Montuenga, Luis M.; Garassino, Marina; Penault-Llorca, Frederique; Galli, Fabrizia; Ray-Coquard, Isabelle; Querleu, Denis; Riegman, Peter; Kerr, Keith; Van Poppel, Hein; Bjartell, Anders; Codacci-Pisanelli, Giovanni; Koeva-Balabanova, Jasmina; Paradiso, Angelo; Maravic, Zorana; Fotaki, Vassiliki; Malats, Nuria; Bernini, Chiara; Buglioni, Simonetta; Kent, Alastair; Munzone, Elisabetta; Belina, Ivica; Van Meerbeeck, Jan; Duffy, Michael; Jagielska, Beata; Capoluongo, Ettore",Cancers (Basel),425,29

Exposure to live poultry was believed to be the major route of infection. There are limited data on how the general public changes their practices regarding live poultry exposure in response to the early outbreak of this novel influenza and the frequency of population exposure to live poultry in different areas of China. METHODOLOGY: This study investigated population exposures to live birds from various sources during the outbreak of H7N9 in Guangzhou city, China in 2013 and compared them with those observed during the 2006 influenza A(H5N1) outbreak. Adults were telephone-interviewed using two-stage sampling, stratified by three residential areas of Guangzhou: urban areas and two semi-rural areas in one of which (Zengcheng) A(H7N9) virus was detected in a chicken from wet markets. Logistic regression models were built to describe practices protecting against avian influenza, weighted by age and gender, and then compare these practices across residential areas in 2013 with those from a comparable 2006 survey. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Of 1196 respondents, 45% visited wet markets at least daily and 22.0% reported buying live birds from wet markets at least weekly in April-May, 2013, after the H7N9 epidemic was officially declared in late March 2013. Of those buying live birds, 32.3% reported touching birds when buying and 13.7% would slaughter the poultry at home. Although only 10.1% of the respondents reported raising backyard birds, 92.1% of those who did so had physical contact with the birds they raised. Zengcheng respondents were less likely to report buying live birds from wet markets, but more likely to buy from other sources when compared to urban respondents. Compared with the 2006 survey, the prevalence of buying live birds from wet markets, touching when buying and slaughtering birds at home had substantially declined in the 2013 survey. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Although population exposures to live poultry were substantially fewer in 2013 compared to 2006, wet markets and backyard poultry remained the two major sources of live bird exposures for the public in Guangzhou in 2013. Zengcheng residents seemed to have reduced buying live birds from wet markets but not from other sources in response to the detection of H7N9 virus in wet markets.","Liao, Qiuyan; Yuan, Jun; Lau, Eric H.

The most recent occurrence originated in the city of Wuhan, China, where a novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]) emerged causing severe respiratory illness and pneumonia. The continual emergence of novel coronaviruses underscores the importance of developing effective vaccines as well as novel therapeutic options that target either viral functions or host factors recruited to support coronavirus replication. The CoV nonstructural protein 1 (nsp1) has been shown to promote cellular mRNA degradation, block host cell translation, and inhibit the innate immune response to virus infection. Interestingly, deletion of the nsp1-coding region in infectious clones prevented the virus from productively infecting cultured cells. Because of nsp1’s importance in the CoV life cycle, it has been highlighted as a viable target for both antiviral therapy and vaccine development. However, the fundamental molecular and structural mechanisms that underlie nsp1 function remain poorly understood, despite its critical role in the viral life cycle. Here, we report the high-resolution crystal structure of the amino globular portion of SARS-CoV-2 nsp1 (residues 10 to 127) at 1.77-Å resolution. A comparison of our structure with the SARS-CoV-1 nsp1 structure reveals how mutations alter the conformation of flexible loops, inducing the formation of novel secondary structural elements and new surface features. Paired with the recently published structure of the carboxyl end of nsp1 (residues 148 to 180), our results provide the groundwork for future studies focusing on SARS-CoV-2 nsp1 structure and function during the viral life cycle. IMPORTANCE Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic. One protein known to play a critical role in the coronavirus life cycle is nonstructural protein 1 (nsp1). As such, it has been highlighted in numerous studies as a target for both the development of antivirals and the design of live-attenuated vaccines. Here, we report the high-resolution crystal structure of nsp1 derived from SARS-CoV-2 at 1.77-Å resolution. This structure will facilitate future studies focusing on understanding the relationship between structure and function for nsp1. In turn, understanding these structure-function relationships will allow nsp1 to be fully exploited as a target for both antiviral development and vaccine design.","Clark, Lauren K.; Green, Todd J.; Petit, Chad M.",J Virol,425,1

SARS-CoV-2 is the etiological agent of “coronavirus disease 2019”, abbreviated to COVID-19, which despite only being identified at the very end of 2019, has now been classified as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). At this time, no specific prophylactic or postexposure therapy for COVID-19 are currently available. Viral entry is the first step in the SARS-CoV-2 lifecycle and is mediated by the trimeric spike protein. Being the first stage in infection, entry of SARS-CoV-2 into host cells is an extremely attractive therapeutic intervention point. Within this review, we highlight therapeutic intervention strategies for anti-SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and other coronaviruses and speculate upon future directions for SARS-CoV-2 entry inhibitor designs.","Xiu, Siyu; Dick, Alexej; Ju, Han; Mirzaie, Sako; Abdi, Fatemeh; Cocklin, Simon; Zhan, Peng; Liu, Xinyong",J Med Chem,425,1

Previous research on assessment using synchronous virtual visits showed mixed results regarding antibiotic prescription rates, and research on assessment using asynchronous chat-based eVisits is lacking. OBJECTIVE: The goal of the research was to investigate if eVisit management of sore throat, other respiratory symptoms, or dysuria leads to higher rates of antibiotic prescription compared with usual management using physical office visits. METHODS: Data from 3847 eVisits and 759 office visits for sore throat, dysuria, or respiratory symptoms were acquired from a large private health care provider in Sweden. Data were analyzed to compare antibiotic prescription rates within 3 days, antibiotic type, and diagnoses made. For a subset of sore throat visits (n=160 eVisits, n=125 office visits), Centor criteria data were manually extracted and validated. RESULTS: Antibiotic prescription rates were lower following eVisits compared with office visits for sore throat (169/798, 21.2%, vs 124/312, 39.7%; P<.001) and respiratory symptoms (27/1724, 1.6%, vs 50/251, 19.9%; P<.001), while no significant differences were noted comparing eVisits to office visits for dysuria (1016/1325, 76.7%, vs 143/196, 73.0%; P=.25). Guideline-recommended antibiotics were prescribed similarly following sore throat eVisits and office visits (163/169, 96.4%, vs 117/124, 94.4%; P=.39). eVisits for respiratory symptoms and dysuria were more often prescribed guideline-recommended antibiotics (26/27, 96.3%, vs 37/50, 74.0%; P=.02 and 1009/1016, 99.3%, vs 135/143, 94.4%; P<.001, respectively). Odds ratios of antibiotic prescription following office visits compared with eVisits after adjusting for age and differences in set diagnoses were 2.94 (95% CI 1.99-4.33), 11.57 (95% CI 5.50-24.32), 1.01 (95% CI 0.66-1.53), for sore throat, respiratory symptoms, and dysuria, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The use of asynchronous eVisits for the management of sore throat, dysuria, and respiratory symptoms is not associated with an inherent overprescription of antibiotics compared with office visits.

Further, shed infectious virus is detectable in nasal washes, oropharyngeal and rectal swabs, and viral RNA is detectable in feces and occasionally urine. We further show that deer mice are capable of transmitting SARS-CoV-2 to naïve deer mice through direct contact. The extent to which these observations may translate to wild deer mouse populations remains unclear, and the risk of reverse zoonosis and/or the potential for the establishment of Peromyscus rodents as a North American reservoir for SARS-CoV-2 remains unknown.","Griffin, Bryan D.; Chan, Mable; Tailor, Nikesh; Mendoza, Emelissa J.; Leung, Anders; Warner, Bryce M.; Duggan, Ana T.; Moffat, Estella; He, Shihua; Garnett, Lauren; Tran, Kaylie N.; Banadyga, Logan; Albietz, Alixandra; Tierney, Kevin; Audet, Jonathan; Bello, Alexander; Vendramelli, Robert; Boese, Amrit S.; Fernando, Lisa; Lindsay, L.

The aim of the present study protocol is to evaluate whether an intervention consisting of guided DMRs, supported by a remote specialist and audit/feedback on care performance will reduce ICU length of stay compared with a control group. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A multicentre, controlled, cluster-randomised superiority trial including 30 ICUs in Brazil (15 intervention and 15 control), from August 2019 to June 2021. In a parallel assignment, ICUs are randomised to a complex-intervention composed by daily rounds carried out through Tele-ICU by a remote ICU physician; development of local quality indicators dashboards coupled with monthly meetings with local leadership; and dissemination of evidence-based clinical protocols versus usual care. Primary outcome is ICU length of stay. Secondary outcomes include classification of the unit according to the profiles defined by the standardised resource use and the standardised mortality rate, hospital mortality, incidence of healthcare-associated infections, ventilator-free days at 28 days, patient-days receiving oral or enteral feeding, patient-days under light sedation or alert and calm, rate of patients under normoxaemia. All adult patients admitted after the beginning of the study in each participant ICU will be enrolled. Inclusion criteria (clusters): public Brazilian ICUs with a minimum of 8 ICU beds interested/committed to participating in the study. Exclusion criteria (clusters): units with fully established DMRs by an intensivist, specialised or step-down units. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study protocol was approved by the institutional review board (IRB) of the coordinator centre, and by IRBs of each enrolled hospital/ICU.

The capacity of hospitals to deal with the challenge from emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases due to climate change is of great importance to population health. This study aimed to explore the capacity of hospitals in China to deal with such challenges. METHODS: A cross-sectional questionnaire survey was utilized to gauge information regarding capacity of hospitals to deal with infectious diseases in the context of climate change among 611 clinical professionals whose roles pertained to infectious disease diagnosis, treatment and management in Anhui Province of China. Descriptive analysis and logistic regression analysis were performed on the data. RESULTS: More than 90% of participants believed climate change would have an adverse influence on population health and infectious disease control in China. Most indicated that their hospitals were well prepared for emerging infectious diseases at present, and they considered that logistical support in hospitals (e.g. administrative and maintenance services) should be strengthened for future capacity building. The majority of participants suggested that effective prevention and control measures, more interdisciplinary collaborations, more funding in rural areas for health care, and improved access to facilities enabling online reporting of infectious diseases, were extremely important strategies in building capacity to curb the population health impact of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases due to climate change in China. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical professionals recognized that climate change will likely increase the transmission of infectious diseases. Although rural health care and hospitals’ logistical support need to be improved, most professionals believed their hospitals to be capable of dealing with emerging diseases. They thought that interdisciplinary and cross-regional collaborations, together with necessary resource support (e.g. improved facilities for rural health care) would be important control strategies.","Tong, Michael Xiaoliang; Hansen, Alana; Hanson-Easey, Scott; Xiang, Jianjun; Cameron, Scott; Liu, Qiyong; Liu, Xiaobo; Sun, Yehuan; Weinstein, Philip; Han, Gil-Soo; Bi, Peng",Soc Sci Med,425,9

We hereby aim to investigate whether the risk of severe and moderate systemic symptoms (MSS) after vaccination is higher in HCWs with a history of previous COVID-19. METHODS: An online questionnaire was offered to the cohort all HCWs undergoing anti-SARS CoV-2 mRNA BNT162b2 vaccination between January 4th and February 9th 2021 in two large tertiary hospitals (ASST Santi Paolo and Carlo) in Milan, Italy. Previous SARS-CoV-2 infection/COVID-19 was recorded. Local and systemic symptoms after each of the two doses were reported. MSS were those either interfering with daily activities or resulting in time off-work. Factors associated to MSS were identified by logistic regression. FINDINGS: 3,078 HCW were included. Previous SARS-CoV-2 infection/COVID-19 occurred in 396 subjects (12·9%). 59·6% suffered from ≥1 local or systemic symptom after the first and 73·4% after the second dose. MSS occurred in 6·3% of cases (14·4% with previous vs 5·1% with no COVID-19 p<0·001) and in 28·3% (24·5% in COVID-19 vs 28·3% no COVID, p = 0·074) after the first and second dose, respectively. Subjects already experiencing COVID-19 had an independent 3-fold higher risk of MSS after the first and a 30% lower risk after the second dose. No severe adverse events were reported. INTERPRETATION: Our data confirm in a real-world setting, the lack of severe adverse events and the short duration of reactogenicity in already infected HCWs. Possible differences in immune reactivity are drivers of MSS among this group of HCWs, as well as among females and younger individuals.

Vit D deficiency or insufficiency is very common in the general population as well as in patients with COVID-19. It has been shown that low Vit D level is associated with viral infection, and Vit D supplementation is beneficial for people infected with viruses, such as HIV and hepatitis C virus. Although COVID-19 is a respiratory disease, the morbidity and mortality of this disease are driven by coagulopathy. Clinical studies have shown that Vit D can exert anticoagulant effects. Vit D, a lipid-soluble vitamin, can be administered as a draught. Vit D supplementation is safe and has rare toxic events. In addition, the cost of Vit D is fairly low. Based on these observations, we speculate that a single dose of 300,000 IU Vit D may have a role in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.","Liu, Guoqiang; Hong, Tianpei; Yang, Jin",Drug Des Devel Ther,425,10

Consequently, it causes significant economic losses to the pork industry. There are limited studies on the innate immune responses to PED virus (PEDV) in pigs. The aims of our study were to investigate differences in innate immune responses to PEDV infection in suckling and weaned pigs and to examine if disease severity coincides with reduced innate immune responses. Weaned 26-day-old pigs (n = 20) and 9-day-old nursing pigs (n = 20) were assigned to PEDV inoculated or uninoculated control groups. The pigs were observed daily for clinical signs, virus shedding and were euthanized at post-inoculation days (PIDs) 1 and 5 to assay immune responses. Blood samples were collected at PIDs 1, 3 and 5. The natural killer (NK) cell frequencies, NK cell activities (lysis of target K562 tumor cells in vitro), CD3+CD4+ T cell and CD3+CD8+ T cell frequencies were measured in blood and ileum at PIDs 1 and 5. The PEDV infected suckling pigs showed severe diarrhea and vomiting at PID 1, whereas the PEDV infected weaned pigs showed milder clinical signs starting at PID 3. PEDV infected suckling pigs had significantly higher diarrhea scores, earlier fecal PEDV RNA shedding and significantly higher viremia (viral RNA in serum) compared to weaned pigs. There was no mortality in either infected suckling or infected weaned pigs. The control pigs not inoculated with PEDV did not show any clinical signs and no detectable fecal or serum PEDV RNA. Strikingly, PEDV infected suckling pigs had significantly lower NK cell frequencies, undetectable NK cell activity and lower IFNγ producing NK cells in blood and ileum compared to PEDV infected weaned pigs. Pro-inflammatory cytokine profiles of PEDV infected suckling pigs differed from those of PEDV infected weaned pigs and coincided with onset of fecal PEDV RNA shedding and serum PEDV RNA titers. The infected suckling pigs have higher and earlier increases in serum IFNα, but lower serum IL-8 and TNFα levels compared to infected weaned pigs. CD3+CD4+ T cell frequencies were significantly higher in ileum of suckling pigs than in weaned pigs, whereas there was no difference in CD3+CD8+ T cell frequencies. In conclusion, the observations of impaired lytic activity and IFN-γ production by NK cells in suckling pigs coincided with the increased severity of PEDV infection in the suckling pigs compared with the weaned pigs.","Annamalai, Thavamathi; Saif, Linda J.; Lu, Zhongyan; Jung, Kwonil",Vet Immunol Immunopathol,425,23

It is noteworthy that digestive symptoms are also observed in COVID-19 patients. In this article, we describe the immuno-inflammatory characteristics of low severity COVID-19 patients with digestive symptoms. METHODS: Patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19 were split into three groups based on the patients' symptoms. The first group displayed digestive symptoms only, the second group displayed respiratory symptoms only, and the last group displayed both digestive and respiratory symptoms. Patients were discharged based on negative results of rRT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 from at least two sequential respiratory tract specimens collected ≥24 hours apart. Multiorgan function and immuno-inflammatory characteristics were analyzed for all of the three groups. RESULTS: Mild liver damage and activation of the immuno-inflammatory system were the most common abnormalities observed in patients with mild COVID-19 symptoms but no significant differences were found (P > 0.05). Patients with digestive symptoms were more likely to have slightly higher and later peak values of inflammatory cytokines during the subsequent course of disease (P < 0.05). In addition, a significant correlation between IL-2 and TNF level was found in the first group which included patients with digestive symptoms only (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with mild cases of COVID-19 only displaying digestive symptoms are a special subtype. Patients in this group were more likely to have slightly higher and delayed peak values of inflammatory cytokines during the subsequent course of the disease. Prevention and clinical management of this type should be taken into consideration.","Duan, Caihan; Zhang, Shengyan; Wang, Jian; Qian, Wei; Han, Chaoqun; Hou, Xiaohua",Gastroenterol Res Pract,425,22

In our renal service we reduced HD frequency from thrice to twice-weekly in selected patients with the primary aim of reducing COVID 19 exposure and transmission between HD patients. METHODS: Dialysis unit nephrologists identified 166 suitable patients (38.4% of our HD population) to temporarily convert to twice-weekly haemodialysis immediately prior to the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in our area. Changes in pre-dialysis weight, systolic blood pressure (SBP) and biochemistry were recorded weekly throughout the 4-week project. Hyperkalaemic patients (serum potassium > 6.0 mmol/L) were treated with a potassium binder, sodium bicarbonate and received responsive dietary advice. RESULTS: There were 12 deaths (5 due to COVID-19) in the HD population, 6 of which were in the twice weekly HD group; no deaths were definitively associated with change of dialysis protocol. A further 19 patients were either hospitalised and/or developed COVID-19 and thus transferred back to thrice weekly dialysis as per protocol. 113 (68.1%) were still receiving twice-weekly HD by the end of the 4-week project. Indications for transfer back to thrice weekly were; fluid overload (19), persistent hyperkalaemia (4), patient request (4) and compliance (1). There were statistically significant increases in SBP and pre-dialysis potassium during the project. CONCLUSIONS: Short term conversion of a large but selected HD population to twice-weekly dialysis sessions was possible and safe. This approach could help mitigate COVID-19 transmission amongst dialysis patients in centres with similar organisational pressures.","Lodge, Michelle Da Silva; Abeygunaratne, Thilini; Alderson, Helen; Ali, Ibrahim; Brown, Nina; Chrysochou, Constantina; Donne, Rosie; Erekosima, Ibi; Evans, Philip; Flanagan, Emma; Gray, Simon; Green, Darren; Hegarty, Janet; Hyde, Audrey; Kalra, Philip A.; Lamerton, Elizabeth; Lewis, David; Middleton, Rachel; New, David; Nipah, Robert; O’Donoghue, Donal; O’Riordan, Edmond; Poulikakos, Dimitrios; Rainone, Francesco; Raman, Maharajan; Ritchie, James; Sinha, Smeeta; Wood, Grahame; Tollitt, J.",BMC Nephrol,425,11
