288,"Chinese-like Strain of Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus, Thailand",2009-07-11,"Since late 2007, several outbreaks of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) infection have emerged in Thailand. Phylogenetic analysis places all Thai PEDV isolates during the outbreaks in the same clade as the Chinese strain JS-2004-2. This new genotype PEDV is prevailing and currently causing sporadic outbreaks in Thailand.","Puranaveja, Suphasawatt; Poolperm, Pariwat; Lertwatcharasarakul, Preeda; Kesdaengsakonwut, Sawang; Boonsoongnern, Alongkot; Urairong, Kitcha; Kitikoon, Pravina; Choojai, Porjit; Kedkovid, Roongtham; Teankum, Komkrich; Thanawongnuwech, Roongroje",Emerg Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2744260/,135
880,Post-Transcriptional Control of Type I Interferon Induction by Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus in Its Natural Host Cells,2012-05-02,"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is not only a poor inducer of type I interferon but also inhibits the efficient induction of type I interferon by porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and synthetic dsRNA molecules, Poly I:C. However, the mechanistic basis by which PRRSV interferes with the induction of type I interferon in its natural host cells remains less well defined. The purposes of this review are to summarize the key findings in supporting the post-transcriptional control of type I interferon in its natural host cells and to propose the possible role of translational control in the regulation of type I interferon induction by PRRSV.","Wang, Xiuqing; Christopher-Hennings, Jane",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3386621/,135
1313,Comparison of viremia of type II porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus in naturally infected pigs by zip nucleic acid probe-based real-time PCR,2013-09-12,"BACKGROUND: Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is a RNA virus with high genetic variation. This virus causes significant economic losses in most pig-producing countries. The clinical presentation of PRRSV ranges from asymptomatic to devastating. In this study, we developed a sensitive and specific zip nucleic acid probe-based real-time PCR assay to evaluate the viremia of natural PRRSV-infected pigs in Taiwan. Serum samples were collected from 577 pigs aged 5–12 weeks. These include 444 clinically healthy pigs and 133 symptomatic pigs were confirmed to have porcine respiratory disease complex (PRDC). RESULTS: Viremia was quantified in 79 of the 444 (17.8%) clinically healthy pigs and in 112 of the 133 (84.2%) PRDC cases. Viremias were significantly more common in pigs with PRDC compared with the clinically healthy pigs (P <0.0001). These results suggest that a high viral load is a major feature of PRRSV-affected pigs. CONCLUSIONS: ZNA probe-based real-time PCR can be a useful tool to diagnose symptomatic and asymptomatic PRRSV-infected pigs. The presence of this marker in a sample of animals with high PRRSV loads (>10(4.2) PRRSV genomes/μl of serum) seems to indicate that it correlates with the presence of PRDC in pigs.","Lin, Chao-Nan; Lin, Wei-Hao; Hung, Li-Ning; Wang, Sheng-Yuan; Chiou, Ming-Tang",BMC Vet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3847877/,135
1379,"Genetic Variability and Phylogeny of Current Chinese Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus Strains Based on Spike, ORF3, and Membrane Genes",2014-01-22,"Since late 2010, the outbreak of porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) in China has resulted in the deaths of millions of suckling piglets. The main cause of the disease outbreak was unknown. In this study, partial spike (S), ORF3, and membrane (M) genes amplified from these variants were sequenced and analyzed. The results showed that the variants could be clustered into one to three subgroups and suggested that S genes were variable, while M genes were relatively conserved. Moreover, in comparison with the vaccine strain CV777, sequence alignment analyses revealed that the S genes of the newly isolated strains contained several mutations at the aa level. It is possible that these mutations have changed the hydrophobicity of the S protein and influenced the viral antigenicity and virulence. Interestingly, homology analyses based on ORF3 demonstrated that the isolates had an intact opening reading frame (ORF), which were different from the attenuated DR13 strain. In conclusion, the widespread PED virus (PEDV) isolates had virulent characteristics. Additionally, the high degree of variation in the genes, particularly S genes, might provide an explanation for the poor immunity and rapid spread of the disease.","Sun, Ruiqin; Leng, Zhangming; Zhai, Shao-Lun; Chen, Dekun; Song, Changxu",ScientificWorldJournal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3919097/,135
1415,An innovative approach to induce cross-protective immunity against porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus in the lungs of pigs through adjuvanted nanotechnology-based vaccination,2014-03-24,"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is an economically devastating respiratory disease of pigs. The disease is caused by the PRRS virus (PRRSV), an Arterivirus which is a highly mutating RNA virus. Widely used modified live PRRSV vaccines have failed to prevent PRRS outbreaks and reinfections; moreover, safety of the live virus vaccines is questionable. Though poorly immunogenic, inactivated PRRSV vaccine is safe. The PRRSV infects primarily the lung macrophages. Therefore, we attempted to strengthen the immunogenicity of inactivated/killed PRRSV vaccine antigens (KAg), especially in the pig respiratory system, through: 1) entrapping the KAg in biodegradable poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) nanoparticles (NP-KAg); 2) coupling the NP-KAg with a potent mucosal adjuvant, whole cell lysate of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb WCL); and 3) delivering the vaccine formulation twice intranasally to growing pigs. We have previously shown that a single dose of NP-KAg partially cleared the challenged heterologous PRRSV. Recently, we reported that NP-KAg coupled with unentrapped M. tb WCL significantly cleared the viremia of challenged heterologous PRRSV. Since PRRSV is primarily a lung disease, our goal in this study was to investigate lung viral load and various immune correlates of protection at the lung mucosal surfaces and its parenchyma in vaccinated heterologous PRRSV-challenged pigs. Our results indicated that out of five different vaccine-adjuvant formulations, the combination of NP-KAg and unentrapped M. tb WCL significantly cleared detectable replicating infective PRRSV with a tenfold reduction in viral RNA load in the lungs, associated with substantially reduced gross and microscopic lung pathology. Immunologically, strong humoral (enhanced virus neutralization titers by high avidity antibodies) and cell-mediated immune responses (augmented population of interferon-γ secreting CD4(+) and CD8(+) lymphocytes and reduced secretion of immunosuppressive cytokines) in the lungs were observed. In conclusion, combination of NP-KAg and soluble M. tb WCL elicits broadly cross-protective anti-PRRSV immunity in the pig respiratory system.","Binjawadagi, Basavaraj; Dwivedi, Varun; Manickam, Cordelia; Ouyang, Kang; Torrelles, Jordi B; Renukaradhya, Gourapura J",Int J Nanomedicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3969340/,135
1486,Interactome Profile of the Host Cellular Proteins and the Nonstructural Protein 2 of Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus,2014-06-05,"The nonstructural protein 2 (NSP2) is considered to be one of crucial viral proteins in the replication and pathogenesis of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV). In the present study, the host cellular proteins that interact with the NSP2 of PRRSV were immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody from the MARC-145 cells infected by a recombinant PRRSV with 3xMyc tag insertion in its NSP2-coding region, and then 285 cellular proteins interacting with NSP2 were identified by LC-MS/MS. The Gene Ontology and enriched KEGG Pathway bioinformatics analyses indicated that the identified proteins could be assigned to different subcellular locations and functional classes. Functional analysis of the interactome profile highlighted cellular pathways associated with infectious disease, translation, immune system, nervous system and signal transduction. Two interested cellular proteins–BCL2-associated athanogene 6 (BAG6) and apoptosis-inducing factor 1 (AIF1) which may involve in transporting of NSP2 to Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or PRRSV-driven apoptosis were validated by Western blot. The interactome data between PRRSV NSP2 and cellular proteins contribute to the understanding of the roles of NSP2 in the replication and pathogenesis of PRRSV, and also provide novel cellular target proteins for elucidating the associated molecular mechanisms of the interaction of host cellular proteins with viral proteins in regulating the viral replication.","Wang, Li; Zhou, Lei; Zhang, Han; Li, Yan; Ge, Xinna; Guo, Xin; Yu, Kangzhen; Yang, Hanchun",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4047090/,135
1807,Resolution of the cellular proteome of the nucleocapsid protein from a highly pathogenic isolate of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus identifies PARP-1 as a cellular target whose interaction is critical for virus biology,2015-03-23,"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is a major threat to the swine industry and food security worldwide. The nucleocapsid (N) protein is a major structural protein of PRRSV. The primary function of this protein is to encapsidate the viral RNA genome, and it is also thought to participate in the modulation of host cell biology and recruitment of cellular factors to facilitate virus infection. In order to the better understand these latter roles the cellular interactome of PRRSV N protein was defined using label free quantitative proteomics. This identified several cellular factors that could interact with the N protein including poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase 1 (PARP-1), a cellular protein, which can add adenosine diphosphate ribose to a protein. Use of the PARP-1 small molecule inhibitor, 3-AB, in PRRSV infected cells demonstrated that PARP-1 was required and acted as an enhancer factor for virus biology. Serial growth of PRRSV in different concentrations of 3-AB did not yield viruses that were able to grow with wild type kinetics, suggesting that by targeting a cellular protein crucial for virus biology, resistant phenotypes did not emerge. This study provides further evidence that cellular proteins, which are critical for virus biology, can also be targeted to ablate virus growth and provide a high barrier for the emergence of drug resistance.","Liu, Long; Lear, Zoe; Hughes, David J.; Wu, Weining; Zhou, En-min; Whitehouse, Adrian; Chen, Hongying; Hiscox, Julian A.",Vet Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4414928/,135
1891,Identification and pathogenicity of a variant porcine epidemic diarrhea virus field strain with reduced virulence,2015-06-12,"BACKGROUND: Since 2010, a variant Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), which causes an acute, highly contagious, and devastating viral enteric disease with a high mortality rate in suckling pigs, broke out in China and spread rapidly to neighboring countries, even to the North America. This virus gradually became the main subtype of PEDV worldwide. However, there were no reports of mild pathogenicity of a variant porcine epidemic diarrhea virus in China. FINDINGS: In 2013, a PEDV-positive sample from a sow with very mild clinical sign was used to inoculate in Vero cells to isolate the virus. This PEDV field strain, designated FL2013 strain, was successfully propagated and genetically characterized. The phylogenetic trees based upon either the complete genome or S gene showed that the FL2013 strain belongs to the genogroup G2b. The S gene of FL2013 has a 7-aa deletion (FEKVHVQ) in the C-terminus comparison with the other G2 PEDV sequences. Further comparative pathology study indicated that the FL2013 strain had reduced virulence to newborn piglets. CONCLUSIONS: A novel variant PEDV strain FL2013 with reduced virulence, as determined by the pathological study, was identified from east China. This strain is closely related to the genogroup- 2 PEDV strains prevalent in the U.S. and China currently, but had a short deletion at the 3′- end of the spike gene.","Zhang, Xiangbin; Pan, Yongfei; Wang, Dongdong; Tian, Xiaoyan; Song, Yanhua; Cao, Yongchang",Virol J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4504071/,135
1958,The 15N and 46R Residues of Highly Pathogenic Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus Nucleocapsid Protein Enhance Regulatory T Lymphocytes Proliferation,2015-09-23,"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) negatively modulates host immune responses, resulting in persistent infection and immunosuppression. PRRSV infection increases the number of PRRSV-specific regulatory T lymphocytes (Tregs) in infected pigs. However, the target antigens for Tregs proliferation in PRRSV infection have not been fully understood. In this study, we demonstrated that the highly pathogenic PRRSV (HP-PRRSV) induced more CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) Tregs than classical PRRSV (C-PRRSV) strain. Of the recombinant GP5, M and N proteins of HP-PRRSV expressed in baculovirus expression systems, only N protein induced Tregs proliferation. The Tregs assays showed that three amino-acid regions, 15–21, 42–48 and 88–94, in N protein played an important role in induction of Tregs proliferation with synthetic peptides covering the whole length of N protein. By using reverse genetic methods, it was firstly found that the 15N and 46R residues in PRRSV N protein were critical for induction of Tregs proliferation. The phenotype of induced Tregs closely resembled that of transforming-growth-factor-β-secreting T helper 3 Tregs in swine. These data should be useful for understanding the mechanism of immunity to PRRSV and development of infection control strategies in the future.","Fan, Baochao; Liu, Xing; Bai, Juan; Li, Yufeng; Zhang, Qiaoya; Jiang, Ping",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4580451/,135
2264,Nonstructural protein 11 (nsp11) of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) promotes PRRSV infection in MARC-145 cells,2016-06-06,"BACKGROUND: Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) induces one of most important devastating disease of swine worldwide, and the current methods poorly control it. Previous studies have indicated that the nonstructural protein 11 (nsp11) of PRRSV may be an important protein for the immune escape of PRRSV. RESULTS: Here, we firstly explored the effect of over-expression of nsp11 on PRRSV infection and found that over-expression of nsp11 enhanced the PRRSV titers while the small interfering RNA (siRNAs) specifically targeting nsp11 could reduce the PRRSV titers in MARC-145 cells. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, PRRSV nsp11 promotes PRRSV infection in MARC-145 cells and siRNAs targeting nsp11 may be a potential therapeutic strategy to control PRRSV in future.","Shi, Xibao; Zhang, Xiaozhuan; Chang, Yongzhe; Jiang, Bo; Deng, Ruiguang; Wang, Aiping; Zhang, Gaiping",BMC Vet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4895886/,135
2575,Assessment of the efficacy of two novel DNA vaccine formulations against highly pathogenic Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus,2017-02-03,"Since May 2006, a highly pathogenic porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (HP-PRRSV) has emerged and prevailed in mainland China, affecting over 2 million pigs. Commercial PRRSV killed and modified live vaccines cannot provide complete protection against HP-PRRSV due to genetic variation. Development of more effective vaccines against the emerging HP-PRRSV is urgently required. In our previous studies, two formulations of DNA vaccines (pcDNA3.1-PoIFN-λ1-SynORF5 and BPEI/PLGA-SynORF5) based on the HP-PRRSV were constructed and shown to induce enhanced humoral and cellular immune responses in mice. The objective of this study was to evaluate the immune response induced by these novel formulations in piglets. PcDNA3.1-PoIFN-λ1-SynORF5 and BPEI/PLGA-SynORF5 vaccines induced significantly enhanced GP5-specific antibody and PRRSV-specific neutralizing antibody in pigs compared with the pcDNA3.1-SynORF5 parental construct. Though IFN-γ levels and lymphocyte proliferation responses induced by the two DNA vaccine formulations were comparable to that induced by the pcDNA3.1-SynORF5 construct, each of the novel formulations provided efficient protection against challenge with HP-PRRSV. Non-severe clinical signs and rectal temperatures were observed in pigs immunized with BPEI/PLGA-SynORF5 compared with other groups. Thus, these novel DNA constructs may represent promising candidate vaccines against emerging HP-PRRSV.","Du, Luping; Pang, Fengjiao; Yu, Zhengyu; Xu, Xiangwei; Fan, Baochao; Huang, Kehe; He, Kongwang; Li, Bin",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5291100/,135
2764,Mechanisms of Adaptive Immunity to Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus,2017-06-13,"The adaptive immune response is necessary for the development of protective immunity against infectious diseases. Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), a genetically heterogeneous and rapidly evolving RNA virus, is the most burdensome pathogen of swine health and wellbeing worldwide. Viral infection induces antigen-specific immunity that ultimately clears the infection. However, the resulting immune memory, induced by virulent or attenuated vaccine viruses, is inconsistently protective against diverse viral strains. The immunological mechanisms by which primary and memory protection are generated and used are not well understood. Here, we summarize current knowledge regarding cellular and humoral components of the adaptive immune response to PRRSV infection that mediate primary and memory immune protection against viruses.","Rahe, Michael C.; Murtaugh, Michael P.",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5490824/,135
3011,Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus suppresses post-transcriptionally the protein expression of IFN-β by upregulating cellular microRNAs in porcine alveolar macrophages in vitro,2017-10-30,"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) has been recognized to inhibit the response of type I interferon (IFN) both in vivo and in vitro. However, the post-transcriptional mechanism by which PRRSV suppresses type I IFN induction in virus-infected host cells remains unclear. The present study first demonstrated that PRRSV inhibited post-transcriptionally the protein induction of IFN-β in primary porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) during early infection, and the inhibition effect mediated by the Chinese highly pathogenic (HP)-PRRSV was stronger. Next, we analyzed the cellular microRNA (miRNA)-modulated protein expression of porcine IFN-β by dual firefly/Renilla luciferase reporter assay, transfection of miRNA mimics and inhibitor assay and polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly I:C) treatment of PAMs, showing that porcine miRNAs including let-7b, miR-26a, miR-34a and miR-145 are able to inhibit IFN-β protein expression in primary PAMs by directly targeting sequences within the porcine IFN-β 3′UTR locating at 160–181, 9–31, 27–47 and 12–32 bp, respectively. Finally, we confirmed that let-7b, miR-26a, miR-34a and miR-145, were upregulated in PRRSV-infected PAMs early in vitro, and the expression level of these miRNAs in HP-PRRSV JXwn06-infected PAMs were higher than those in low pathogenic PRRSV HB-1/3.9-infected PAMs. The endogenous cellular miRNA-mediated inhibition of IFN-β induction in PRRSV-infected PAMs early could be relieved by miRNA antagonists. Taken together, our findings suggest for the first time that PRRSV can suppress post-transcriptionally protein expression of IFN-β by upregulating cellular miRNAs in PAMs in vitro, providing novel insight into mechanisms in relation to the PRRSV-mediated immunomodulation of porcine innate immunity.","Wang, Lilin; Zhou, Lei; Hu, Dongmei; Ge, Xinna; Guo, Xin; Yang, Hanchun",Exp Ther Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5769220/,135
3478,A unique intra-molecular fidelity-modulating mechanism identified in a viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase,2018-11-16,"Typically not assisted by proofreading, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRPs) encoded by the RNA viruses may need to independently control its fidelity to fulfill virus viability and fitness. However, the precise mechanism by which the RdRP maintains its optimal fidelity level remains largely elusive. By solving 2.1–2.5 Å resolution crystal structures of the classical swine fever virus (CSFV) NS5B, an RdRP with a unique naturally fused N-terminal domain (NTD), we identified high-resolution intra-molecular interactions between the NTD and the RdRP palm domain. In order to dissect possible regulatory functions of NTD, we designed mutations at residues Y471 and E472 to perturb key interactions at the NTD–RdRP interface. When crystallized, some of these NS5B interface mutants maintained the interface, while the others adopted an ‘open’ conformation that no longer retained the intra-molecular interactions. Data from multiple in vitro RdRP assays indicated that the perturbation of the NTD–RdRP interactions clearly reduced the fidelity level of the RNA synthesis, while the processivity of the NS5B elongation complex was not affected. Collectively, our work demonstrates an explicit and unique mode of polymerase fidelity modulation and provides a vivid example of co-evolution in multi-domain enzymes.","Liu, Weichi; Shi, Xiaoling; Gong, Peng",Nucleic Acids Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6237809/,135
3734,Negative Immunomodulatory Effects of Type 2 Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus-Induced Interleukin-1 Receptor Antagonist on Porcine Innate and Adaptive Immune Functions,2019-03-26,"Impaired innate and adaptive immune responses are evidenced throughout the course of PRRSV infection. We previously reported that interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) was involved in PRRSV-induced immunosuppression during an early phase of infection. However, the exact mechanism associated with PRRSV-induced IL-1Ra immunomodulation remains unknown. To explore the immunomodulatory properties of PRRSV-induced IL-1Ra on porcine immune functions, monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MoDC) and leukocytes were cultured with type 2 PRRSV, and the immunological role of IL-1Ra was assessed by addition of anti-porcine IL-1Ra Ab. The results demonstrated that PRRSV-induced IL-1Ra reduced phagocytosis, surface expression of MHC II (SLA-DR) and CD86, as well as downregulation of IFNA and IL1 gene expression in the MoDC culture system. Interestingly, IL-1Ra secreted by the PRRSV-infected MoDC also inhibited T lymphocyte differentiation and proliferation, but not IFN-γ production. Although PRRSV-induced IL-1Ra was not directly linked to IL-10 production, it contributed to the differentiation of regulatory T lymphocytes (Treg) within the culture system. Taken together, our results demonstrated that PRRSV-induced IL-1Ra downregulates innate immune functions, T lymphocyte differentiation and proliferation, and influences collectively with IL-10 in the Treg induction. The immunomodulatory roles of IL-1Ra elucidated in this study increase our understanding of the immunobiology of PRRSV.","Nedumpun, Teerawut; Techakriengkrai, Navapon; Thanawongnuwech, Roongroje; Suradhat, Sanipa",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6443931/,135
4846,Typing of recent infectious bronchitis virus isolates causing nephritis in chicken,1991,"PURPOSE: The increased risk of morbidity and mortality from certain microbial infections and the demonstrated improvements in the clinical course of some autoimmune diseases support the existence of pregnancy-related alterations in immune status. Elucidating the changes in innate and adaptive immunity during gestation may improve pregnancy outcomes and facilitate the development of targeted therapies for autoimmune diseases. METHOD: The Viral Immunity and Pregnancy (VIP) study evaluated over 50 subjects longitudinally at three time points during pregnancy and at two time points post-delivery. Leukocyte enumeration was performed; functional responses of NK cells and CD4 T cells were analyzed, and soluble factors such as cytokines, defensins, and steroid hormones were measured in maternal blood. RESULTS: In comparison to the post-partum period, the latter part of pregnancy was characterized by significant increases in blood phagocytes and pDCs and decreases in the number and activity of NK and T cells. Alterations were found in antimicrobial proteins and serum cytokines. CONCLUSIONS: These data show that pregnancy is not a period of immunosuppression but an alteration in immune priorities characterized by a strengthening of innate immune barriers and a concomitant reduction in adaptive/inflammatory immunity in the later stages of pregnancy.","Kraus, Thomas A.; Engel, Stephanie M.; Sperling, Rhoda S.; Kellerman, Lisa; Lo, Yungtai; Wallenstein, Sylvan; Escribese, Maria M.; Garrido, Jose L.; Singh, Tricia; Loubeau, Martine; Moran, Thomas M.",J Clin Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7086597/,135

4877,Antigenic variation in strains of avian infectious bronchitis virus,1971,"Astrocytes isolated from the brain of newborn Lewis rats and an astrocytic cell line were susceptible to infection with the neurotropic Borna disease virus in vitro. Since astrocytes also have been found to be infected in vivo it seemed appropriate to test this cell type for interaction with a Borna disease virus-specific CD4(+) T cell line. Borna disease virus-infected astrocytes were found to be capable of presenting virus-specific antigen to virus-specific T cells in vitro. However, the response was significantly enhanced if the purified 38/39 kDa Borna disease virus-specific protein was added exogenously to the cultures. Beside the function as antigen-presenting cells for various antigens including virus-specific protein and myelin basic protein, persistently infected astrocytes were also found to act as target cells for a CD4(+) T cell line as shown in conventional(51)Cr release assays after induction of MHC class II expression by gamma interferon. Infection of astrocytes alone did not cause expression of this self antigen. It could be shown that the ability of CD4(+) BDV-specific T cells to mediate lysis was in part dependent on the stage of activation. Lymphocytes “activated” before testing exerted high lysis after only 4h of coincubation with target cells, whereas “resting” T cells did not cause significant lysis until 12h of coincubation. The dependence of the interaction between effector and target cells on MHC class II antigen was demonstrated by the finding that antibodies to Ia antigens reduced lysis of target cells.","Richt, J.

There was 96–100% amino acid sequence identity in the putative M and N genes among U.S. and Canadian PRRSV isolates with differing virulence. However, their amino acid sequences varied extensively from those of European PRRSV isolates, and displayed only 57–59% and 78–81% identity, respectively. The phylogenetic trees constructed on the basis of the putative M and N genes of the proposed arterivirus group were similar and indicated that both U.S. and European PRRSV isolates were related to LDV and were distantly related to EAV.

The ORFs 2, 3 and 4 overlapped each other and encoded polypeptides with predicted M(r) of 29.5 kDa (ORF 2), 28.7 kDa (ORF 3) and 19.5 kDa (ORF 4), respectively. No overlap was found between ORFs 4 and 5, and instead there was a 10 bp sequence which separated these two ORFs. The nucleic acid homology with corresponding ORFs of the European PRRSV isolate Lelystad virus (LV) was 65% for ORF 2, 64% for ORF 3 and 66% for ORF 4. Comparison of the ORF 4 sequences of VR2385 with that of another U.S. isolate MN-1b revealed only 86% amino acid sequence homology and the presence of deletions in the ORF 4 of MN-1b. Our results further strengthen the observation that there is sequence variation between US and European PRRSV isolates.","Morozov, I.; Meng, X. -J.; Paul, P.

Its replication was inhibited by IUDR. Tissue cultured virus proved sensitive to ether, chloroform, 0.5 per cent trypsin, and to pH levels of 4.0 or lower. Infectivity was rapidly destroyed at 56° C. Negatively stained naked virions of 100 nm average diameter were seen, and enveloped virions with 160–250 nm size. The capsid was built up of hollow cyclindrical capsomeres, arranged in equilateral triangles, carrying 5 capsomeres along each edge. Cubical symmetry and icosahedron structure yielded a total number of 162 capsomeres. All these biochemical and biophysical data lead to classification of HSIS virus into the genus herpesvirus. Biological properties described in a foregoing paper sustained such grouping, and indicated that the agent was a new avian herpesvirus for which the nameherpesvirus strigis was proposed.","Sibalin, M.; Gerstl, F.; Pichler, L.; Bürki, F.",Arch Gesamte Virusforsch,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7087248/,135

C57BL/6N mice (7-week-old) were divided into four groups. Each group composed of control, dextran sodium sulfate-treated (DSS), C. rodentium-infected (CT), and DSS-treated and C. rodentium-infected (DSS-CT) mice. The DSS group was administered 1% DSS in drinking water for 7 days. The CT group was supplied with normal drinking water for 7 days and subsequently infected with C. rodentium via oral gavage. The DSS-CT group was supplied with 1% DSS in drinking water for 7 days and subsequently infected with C. rodentium via oral gavage. The mice were sacrificed 10 days after the induction of C. rodentium infection. The DSS-CT group displayed significantly shorter colon length, higher spleen to body weight ratio, and higher histopathological score compared to the other three groups. The mRNA expression levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interferon (INF)-γ were significantly upregulated; however, those of interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10 were significantly downregulated in the DSS-CT group than in the control group. These results demonstrated that a combination of low DSS concentration (1%) and C. rodentium infection could effectively induce inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in mice. This may potentially be used as a novel IBD model, in which colitis is induced in mice by the combination of a chemical and a pathogen.

5542,Development of a chimeric strain of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus with an infectious clone and a Korean dominant field strain,2014-03-29,"To determine dietary selenium (Se) status regulates the transcriptions of selenoproteome and activities of selenoenzymes in chicken kidney, 1-day-old chickens received low Se (0.028 mg Se per kg of diet) or super-nutritional Se (3.0 or 5.0 mg Se per kg of diet) in their diets for 8 weeks. It was observed that dietary low or super-nutritional Se did not make renal appearance pathological changes in chicken. Low Se significantly reduced total antioxidant capability (T-AOC), glutathione (GSH) content, but malondialdehyde (MDA) content in the kidney increased and decreased glutathione peroxidase (Gpx) and thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) activity with changes in their mRNA levels. Super-nutritional Se (3.0 mg/kg) increased T-AOC and GSH contents then made them reduce, but it reduced MDA content significantly, elevated then reduced Gpx activity, and decreased TrxR activity with changes in their mRNA levels. Dietary low Se downregulated the mRNA expressions of Gpx1-4, Txnrd3, Sepn1, Selw, Sepx1, Selh, and SEPSECS. At super-nutritional Se, most selenoproteins were upregulated in chicken kidney, but Sepp2 and Sep15 was only upregulated in Se excess (5.0 mg/kg) bird. These results indicated that dietary Se status stabilizes normal renal physiology function via regulation of the selenoprotemic transcriptions and selenoenzyme activities in avian.

7644,Antigenic differences between European and American isolates of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) are encoded by the carboxyterminal portion of viral open reading frame 3,2000-03-10,"Two strains of bovine rotavirus (BRV), designated strain Nebraska Scottsbluff-1 (NS-1) and NS-2, were isolated from 2 neighboring cow-calf beef cattle ranches where dams had been vaccinated with a commercial vaccine containing group A BRV strain Neonatal Calf Diarrhea Virus (NCDV)-Lincoln (P1:G6). Nothern blot by hybridizations using whole genomic RNA probes indicated that strains NS-1 and NS-2 had identical group A RNA electrophoretic patterns and were homologous at all gene segments. Strain NS-1 was compared with reference group A BRV strains using serological and genotypic methods. In vitro virus neutralization assays indicated that strain NS-1 was neutralized by a G6-specific neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mAb) and guinea pig hyperimmune serum (GPHS) raised against BRV strain B641 (P5:G6), but not by G10-specific neutralizing mAb or GPHS raised against BRV strain BRV strain B223 (P11:G10). Nucleic acid hybridization experiments using whole-genomic RNA probes revealed that gene segment 4 of strain NS-1 differed from BRV strains NCDV-Lincoln and B223, but hybridized with strain B641. Conversely, gene segment 5 of strain NS-1 hybridized with BRV strain B223, but not with BRV strains NCDV-Lincoln and B641. A G-specific cDNA probe produced by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) amplification of strain NS-1 hybridized specifically only with G6 strains NCDV-Lincoln and B641, but not with G10 strain B223. Co-electrophoresis experiments using strains NS-1, B641, and B223 further confirmed these results, suggesting that strain NS-1 was a naturally-occurring reassortant BRV between strains B641 and B223. Taken together these results indicated that a naturally-occurring group A BRV reassortant with a P gene different from the vaccine virus was responsible for the diarrheal syndrome observed on both ranches. Results from this study also indicate the existence of at least 2 different gene segments 5 among group A BRV infecting cattle.","Lu, Wei; Duhamel, Gerald E.; Benfield, David A.; Grotelueschen, Dale M.",Vet Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7117311/,135

One-half of the pigs in each group were orally infected with transmissible gastroenteritis virus; the remaining pigs served as controls. Threeday-old control pigs concentrated the nonabsorbable fluid marker twelve f old along the small and large intestine, indicating an efficiency of about 95% in absorption of the exogenous daily fluid load presented to the intestine. In contrast, the marker concentration in infected pigs showed no change whatsoever along either the small or large intestine, indicating a complete absence of net fluid absorption or secretion in these animals. Three-week-old control pigs concentrated the marker similarly to the 3-day-old group, with the bulk of the fluid absorption occurring in the small intestine. Infected pigs in the 3-wk-old group had marked net fluid secretion in the proximal small intestine, so that about twice the fluid load was presented to the large intestine of the 3-wk-old infected pigs as compared to the 3-day-old infected group. However, in contrast to the 3-day-old infected group, the large intestine of the 3-wk-old infected pigs increased fluid absorption some six times over the control, and this compensatory response prevented diarrhea in these older animals. Analysis of luminal contents indicated that in the older pigs, unabsorbed carbohydrate was almost completely fermented to short-chain fatty acids in the colon, whereas in the younger pigs the carbohydrate passed through the colon unchanged. These results demonstrate that development of microbial digestion, together with rapid short-chain fatty acid absorption, is a primary feature responsible for the colonic compensation in the older pigs with transmissible gastroenteritis.","Argenzio, R.A.; Moon, H.W.; Kemeny, L.J.; Whipp, S.C.",Gastroenterology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7130427/,135

Subclinical infections were established in only 50% of the cats, none of which became long-term carriers of the organism. Cytological examination of vaginal smears was of no diagnostic value in confirming infection in inapparently infected cats. Bacteriological responses after primary or secondary challenge with the CEM organism were essentially similar, with one exception, a female cat in which there was possible evidence of local immunity persisting after the primary infection. Efforts to reactivate shedding subsequent to the immediate post-challenge period were unsuccessful. Throughout the experimental period, the cats remained sero-negative to the complement-fixation test, and they failed to develop any significant increase in the levels of antibody activity as measured by the kinetics-based ELISA or KELA system. On day 89 after primary challenge, the cats were euthanized and various sites in the genitourinary tract and the internal iliac lymphatic glands subjected to bacteriological and pathological examination for evidence of CEM infection with negative results.

METHODS: Rice-based diets, containing 60% ordinary grocery rice, MingHui63, or TT51 by weight, were given to parental rats (15 males/30 females each group) for 70 days prior mating and throughout pregnancy and lactation. After weaning, eight male offspring rats were randomly selected at each group and fed with diets correspondent to their parents’ for 70 days. The effects of exposure to TT51 on male reproductive system of offspring rats were assessed through sperm parameters, testicular function enzyme activities, serum hormones (FSH, LH, and testosterone levels), testis histopathological examination, and the relative expression levels of selected genes along the hypothalamic-pituitary- testicular (HPT) axis. RESULTS: No significant differences were observed in body weight, food intake, organ/body weights, serum hormone, sperm parameters, testis function enzyme ACP, LDH, and SDH activities, testis histopathological changes, and relative mRNA expression levels of GnRH-R, FSH-R, LH-R, and AR along the HPT axis.

9693,A Stable Calcium Alumanyl,2020-01-30,"Depth of dormancy of alpine and subalpine perennial forbs in autumn was investigated, which was judged by the number of days required for growth initiation at 24 °C. The depth of dormancy differed depending on Raunkiaer's life‐form and shoot habits. Chamaephytes with perennial shoot‐axes showed shallower dormancy than hemicryptophytes with annual shoot‐axes, and geophytes with annual shoot‐axes showed the deepest dormancy. The results strongly suggest that the dormancy is more endogenously controlled in forbs less hardy to freezing stress. Potential growth ability of alpine herbaceous chamaephytes in autumn is an adaptive advantage, since they utilize the short vegetative period as long as possible. All of the species with annual shoot‐axes had winter buds covered with scales. In plants with perennial shoot‐axes, percentage of winter buds covered with scales increased with increasing depth of dormancy. The results indicate that the shoot apices are well protected by bud scales in forbs with a long endogeneous‐dormant period.","Yoshie, Fumio",Ecol Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7159367/,135

Data on Centrolepidaceae are important for comparison with other Poales, including grasses and sedges. • Methods: We examined vegetative and reproductive morphology in a global survey of Centrolepidaceae based on light and scanning electron microscopy of 18 species, representing all three genera. We used these data to perform a cladistic analysis to assess character evolution. • Key results: Each of the three genera is monophyletic; Centrolepis is sister to Aphelia. Some Centrolepidaceae show a change from spiral to distichous phyllotaxy on inflorescence transition. In Aphelia and most species of Centrolepis, several morphologically distinct leaf types develop along the primary shoot axis and flowers are confined to dorsiventral lateral spikelets. Centrolepis racemosa displays secondary unification of programs of leaf development, absence of the leaf hyperphyll and loss of shoot dimorphism. Presence or absence of a leaf ligule and features of inflorescence and flower morphology are useful as phylogenetic characters in Centrolepidaceae. • Conclusions: Ontogenetic changes in phyllotaxy differ fundamentally between some Centrolepidaceae and many grasses. Inferred evolutionary transformations of phyllotaxy in Centrolepidaceae inflorescences also differ from those in grasses. In contrast with grasses, some Centrolepidaceae possess ligulate leaves where the ligule represents the boundary between the bifacial hypophyll and unifacial hyperphyll. All the highly unusual features of the morphological‐misfit species Centrolepis racemosa could result from the same saltational event. Centrolepidaceae offer good perspectives for studies of evolutionary developmental biology.","Sokoloff, Dmitry D.; Remizowa, Margarita V.; Barrett, Matthew D.; Conran, John G.; Rudall, Paula J.",Am J Bot,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7159468/,135

This unique feature is discussed in relation to the implications it has on the intracellular infection process and how such a coding arrangement may have evolved. The chapter presents a list of the known members of the arenaviridae, their origins, and the vertebrate hosts from which isolates have been reported. It discusses the structural components, the infection cycle, and genetic attributes of arenaviruses. In order to determine how arenaviruses code for gene products, the S RNA species of Pichinde virus and that of a viscerotropic strain of LCM virus (LCM-WE) have been cloned into DNA and sequenced. The arenavirus S RNA is described as having an ambisense strategy, to denote the fact that both viral and viral-complementary sequences are used to make gene products.

However, little is known about regulation of the membrane-bound protein import machinery. Here, we report that Pex14, a central component of the protein translocation complex in peroxisomal membrane, is phosphorylated in response to oxidative stresses such as H(2)O(2) in mammalian cells. The H(2)O(2)-induced phosphorylation of Pex14 at Ser232 suppresses peroxisomal import of catalase in vivo and selectively impairs in vitro the interaction of catalase with the Pex14-Pex5 complex. A phosphomimetic mutant Pex14-S232D elevates the level of cytosolic catalase, but not canonical PTS1-proteins, conferring higher cell resistance to H(2)O(2). We thus suggest that the H(2)O(2)-induced phosphorylation of Pex14 spatiotemporally regulates peroxisomal import of catalase, functioning in counteracting action against oxidative stress by the increase of cytosolic catalase.","Okumoto, Kanji; El Shermely, Mahmoud; Natsui, Masanao; Kosako, Hidetaka; Natsuyama, Ryuichi; Marutani, Toshihiro; Fujiki, Yukio",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7498260/,135

30942,GENERAL DISCUSSION,2006-12-16,"AIM: Emerging infectious diseases arising from pathogen spillover from mammals to humans constitute a substantial health threat. Tracing virus origin and predicting the most likely host species for future spillover events are major objectives in One Health disciplines. We assessed patterns of virus sharing among a large diversity of mammals, including humans and domestic species. LOCATION: Global. TIME PERIOD: Current. MAJOR TAXA STUDIED: Mammals and associated viruses. METHODS: We used network centrality analysis and trait‐based Bayesian hierarchical models to explore patterns of virus sharing among mammals. We analysed a global database that compiled the associations between 1,785 virus species and 725 mammalian host species as sourced from automatic screening of meta‐data accompanying published nucleotide sequences between 1950 and 2019. RESULTS: We show that based on current evidence, domesticated mammals hold the most central positions in networks of known mammal–virus associations. Among entire host–virus networks, Carnivora and Chiroptera hold central positions for mainly sharing RNA viruses, whereas ungulates hold central positions for sharing both RNA and DNA viruses with other host species. We revealed strong evidence that DNA viruses were phylogenetically more host specific than RNA viruses. RNA viruses exhibited low functional host specificity despite an overall tendency to infect phylogenetically related species, signifying high potential to shift across hosts with different ecological niches. The frequencies of sharing viruses among hosts and the proportion of zoonotic viruses in hosts were larger for RNA than for DNA viruses. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Acknowledging the role of domestic species in addition to host and virus traits in patterns of virus sharing is necessary to improve our understanding of virus spread and spillover in times of global change. Understanding multi‐host virus‐sharing pathways adds focus to curtail disease spread.","Wells, Konstans; Morand, Serge; Wardeh, Maya; Baylis, Matthew",Glob Ecol Biogeogr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7165700/,135

For instance, information displayed in trains, as well as on departure boards in train stations and on platforms, are often not available in acoustic or tactile form. Digital technologies, such as smartphones or smartwatches, can provide an alternative means of access. However, these alternatives do not guarantee that the user experience is comparable in value, quality and efficiency. The present case study details a participatory design process, where travellers with visual impairments co-designed a mobile app. The goal was to tackle information gaps on journeys by public transport and to learn how participatory design can facilitate the provision of comparable experiences for users with disabilities. Travellers with visual impairments were involved in a collaborative process in all project phases, including problem identification, technical feasibility, proof of concept, design and development. Participatory design contributed to a thorough understanding of the user perspective and allowed the app to be optimised for the needs of travellers with visual impairments.

While test kits are used for diagnosis of the disease, the process takes time and the test kits are limited in their availability. However, the COVID-19 disease is also diagnosable using radiological images taken through lung X-rays. This process is known to be both faster and more reliable as a form of identification and diagnosis. In this regard, the current study proposes an expert-designed system called COVIDetectioNet model, which utilizes features selected from combination of deep features for diagnosis of COVID-19. For this purpose, a pretrained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based AlexNet architecture that employed the transfer learning approach, was used. The effective features that were selected using the Relief feature selection algorithm from all layers of the architecture were then classified using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) method. To verify the validity of the model proposed, a total of 6092 X-ray images, classified as Normal (healthy), COVID-19, and Pneumonia, were obtained from a combination of public datasets. In the experimental results, an accuracy of 99.18% was achieved using the model proposed. The results demonstrate that the proposed COVIDetectioNet model achieved a superior level of success when compared to previous studies.","Turkoglu, Muammer",Appl Intell,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7498308/,135
40582,Plant-Derived Trimeric CO-26K-Equivalent Epitope Induced Neutralizing Antibodies Against Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus,2020-09-16,"BACKGROUND: Patients may have signs of hypovolemia, but fluid administration is not always beneficial. We are in need of bedside devices and techniques, which can predict fluid responsiveness effectively and safely. This study is aiming to compare the effectiveness and reliability of the pleth variability index (PVI) and IVC distensibility index (dIVC) as predictors of fluid responsiveness by simultaneous recordings in all sedated mechanically ventilated patients in the surgical intensive care unit (ICU). We used the passive leg raising test (PLR) as a harmless reversible technique for fluid challenge, and patients were considered responders if the cardiac index (CI) measured by transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) increased ≥ 15% after passive leg raising test (PLR). RESULTS: This observational cross-sectional study was performed randomly on 88 intubated ventilated sedated patients. Compared with CI measured by transthoracic echocardiography, the dIVC provided 79.17% sensitivity and 80% specificity at a threshold value of > 19.42% for fluid responsiveness prediction and was statistically significant (P < .0001), with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.886 (0.801–0.944), while PVI at a threshold value of > 14% provided 93.75% sensitivity and 87.5% specificity and was statistically significant (P < .0001), with an AUC of 0.969 (0.889–0.988). CONCLUSION: PVI and dIVC are effective non-invasive bedside methods for the assessment of fluid responsiveness in ICU for intubated ventilated sedated patients with sinus rhythm, but PVI has the advantage of being continuous, operator-independent, and more reliable than dIVC.","Aboelnile, Diaaeldin Badr Metwally Kotb; Elseidy, Mohamed Ismail Abdelfattah; Kenawey, Yasir Ahmed Elbasiony Mohamed; Elsherif, Ibrahim Mohammed Alsayed Ahmed",Ain-Shams J Anesthesiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7538846/,135

Based on online survey data of 1,029 HIV care providers in Guangxi, China, we assessed their perspectives on the challenges for HIV service delivery and perceived impacts of such challenges on patient care during the COVID-19 outbreak. Multivariate regression analysis was conducted to test the association between specific challenges and patient care outcomes controlling for socio-demographics of HIV care providers. The prominent impacts of COVID-19 on patient care outcomes included ""not being able to make follow-up visits on time"", ""not being able to get ARV refills timely"", and ""compromised ART adherence"". Patient care outcome was significantly associated with ""not being able to go to work due to quarantine and traffic restriction"", ""no overall arrangement"", ""no guideline for HIV service"", ""conflicts between HIV care and response to COVID-19"", and ""clinics were overwhelmed by COVID-19 care"". In response to dual epidemics of COVID-19 and HIV, policy makers may consider the potential impact of large-scale preventive strategies (e.g., lockdowns) on HIV care, assist healthcare providers to navigate shifting tasks and resetting priorities effectively, and develop clear guidelines and clinic-level arrangements to best serve both COVID-19 and HIV patients.","Qiao, Shan; Yang, Xueying; Sun, Shufang; Li, Xiaoming; Mi, Tianyue; Zhou, Yuejiao; Shen, Zhiyong",AIDS care,https://doi.org/10.1080/09540121.2020.1849532; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33242981/,135

The study objective is to describe the incidence and characteristics of MS patients with COVID-19, to identify susceptibility and severity risk factors, and to assess the proportion of positive SARS-CoV-2 serologies according to disease modifying treatments (DMTs). METHODS Retrospective study of an MS cohort analysing data collected between February and May 2020. Cases were identified through an email survey and clinical visits. We examined the relationship of demographic and MS characteristics with COVID-19 and of the DMTs with SARS-CoV-2 serostatus. RESULTS We collected data from 48 suspected cases out of 758 valid respondents and from 45 COVID-19 cases identified through clinical visits. Incidence was 6.3%. Nineteen(20.3%) patients were hospitalized and 2(2.2%) died. Multivariable models determined that age (odds ratio per 10 years:0.53[95% CI,0.34-0.85]), contact with a confirmed case (OR:197.02[56.36-688.79]), residence in Barcelona (OR:2.23[1.03-4.80]), MS duration (OR per 5y:1.41[1.09-1.83]), and time on anti-CD20-treatment (OR per 2y: 3.48[1.44-8.45]) were independent factors for presenting COVID-19 and age (OR per 10y:2.71[1.13-6.53]) for a severe COVID-19. Out of the 79 (84.9%) with serological test, 45.6% generated antibodies, but only 17.6% of those on anti-CD20 therapies. Lymphopenia or immunoglobulins levels did not relate with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS MS patients present similar incidence, risk factors, and outcomes for COVID-19 than the general population. Patients treated with an anti-CD20 therapy for a longer period of time might be in a higher risk of COVID-19 and less than 20% generate antibody response. Only age was related with severity.","Zabalza, Ana; Cárdenas-Robledo, Simón; Tagliani, Paula; Arrambide, Georgina; Otero-Romero, Susana; Carbonell-Mirabent, Pere; Rodriguez-Barranco, Marta; Rodríguez-Acevedo, Breogán; Restrepo Vera, Juan Luis; Resina-Salles, Mireia; Midaglia, Luciana; Vidal-Jordana, Angela; Río, Jordi; Galan, Ingrid; Castillo, Joaquin; Cobo-Calvo, Álvaro; Comabella, Manuel; Nos, Carlos; Sastre-Garriga, Jaume; Tintore, Mar; Montalban, Xavier",European journal of neurology,https://doi.org/10.1111/ene.14690; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33340215/,135
67694,Cell Attachment Domains of the Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus Spike Protein Are Key Targets of Neutralizing Antibodies.,2017,"Siderophores are secreted by microorganisms to survive in iron-depleted conditions, and they also possess tremendous therapeutic potential. Genomic-inspired isolation facilitated the identification of eight amphiphilic siderophores, saccharochelins A-H (1-8), from a rare marine-derived Saccharothrix species. Saccharochelins feature a series of fatty acyl groups appended to the same tetrapeptide skeleton. With the help of gene disruption and heterologous expression, we identified the saccharochelin biosynthetic pathway. The diversity of saccharochelins originates from the flexible specificity of the starter condensation (CS) domain at the beginning of the nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) toward various fatty acyl substrates. Saccharochelins showed cytotoxicity against several human tumor cell lines, with IC50 values ranging from 2.3 to 17 μM. Additionally, the fatty acid side chains of the saccharochelins remarkably affected the cytotoxicity, suggesting changing the N-terminal acyl groups of lipopeptides may be a promising approach to produce more potent derivatives.","Shen, Qiyao; Dai, Guangzhi; Ravichandran, Vinothkannan; Liu, Yang; Zhong, Lin; Sui, Haiyan; Ren, Xiangmei; Jiao, Nianzhi; Zhang, Youming; Zhou, Haibo; Bian, Xiaoying",Journal of natural products,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jnatprod.1c00155; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34323485/,135

As there is currently no randomized controlled trial (RCT) reporting long-term patient-reported outcomes between CTEP and STEP, we reviewed patients who were randomized to CTEP or STEP 5 years after surgery. METHODS Telephone interviews were administered to patients with primary unilateral inguinal hernia recruited for the RCT comparing CTEP and STEP in 2011. The modified Body Image Questionnaire was used to measure long-term patient-reported outcomes. RESULTS Forty-two out of forty-nine of the STEP group and forty-one out of fifty of the CTEP group responded to phone interviews. Median follow-up time, demographic data and clinical outcomes were comparable between both groups. The Body Image Score (5-20: 5-least dissatisfied, 20-most dissatisfied; BIS score ± SD, STEP vs. CTEP, 5.33 ± 0.90 vs. 7.17 ± 1.87, p < 0.001) and Cosmetic Score (2-20: 2-least satisfied, 20-most satisfied; CS score ± SD, STEP vs. CTEP, 19.05 ± 1.31 vs. 15.87 ± 1.57, p < 0.001) were superior in the STEP group. Similarly, self-reported scar perception (1-cannot be seen, 2-can barely be seen, 3-visible; scar perception score ± SD, STEP vs. CTEP, 1.29 ± 0.51 vs. 2.55 ± 0.64, p < 0.001) and overall experience score (1-least satisfied, 10-most satisfied; overall satisfaction score ± SD, STEP vs. CTEP, 9.57 ± 0.67 vs. 8.22 ± 0.94, p < 0.001) were superior in the STEP group. CONCLUSION Patients who underwent STEP reported superior cosmetic and satisfaction scores and comparable surgical outcomes 5 years after surgery compared to the CTEP group. STEP should be strongly considered in patients who are concerned about long-term cosmetic outcomes and should be offered if surgical expertise is available.

70849,"The antiviral mechanisms, effects, safety and adverse effects of chloroquine.",2020-06-01,"MDSC are a heterogeneous population of immature myeloid cells that are released by biological stress such as tissue damage and inflammation. Conventionally, MDSC are known for their detrimental role in chronic inflammation and neoplastic conditions. However, their intrinsic functions in immunoregulation, wound healing, and angiogenesis are intended to protect from over-reactive immune responses, maintenance of immunotolerance, tissue repair, and homeostasis. Paradoxically, under certain conditions, MDSC can impair protective immune responses and exacerbate the disease. The transition from protective to harmful MDSC is most likely driven by environmental and epigenetic mechanisms induced by prolonged exposure to unresolved inflammatory triggers. Here, we review several examples of the dual impact of MDSC in conditions such as maternal-fetal tolerance, self-antigens immunotolerance, obesity-associated cancer, sepsis and trauma. Moreover, we also highlighted the evidence indicating that MDSC have a role in COVID-19 pathophysiology. Finally, we have summarized the evidence indicating epigenetic mechanisms associated with MDSC function.","Sanchez-Pino, Maria Dulfary; Dean, Matthew J; Ochoa, Augusto C",Cellular immunology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cellimm.2021.104302; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33592540/,135

MATERIALS AND METHODS A systematic review was carried out through the PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and Cochrane Library databases. Studies published up to 31/05/2020 were included if they made reference to ventilatory therapies used in ICU patients with COVID-19. RESULTS Qualitative analysis was performed on 30 included studies. A total sample of 48,743 patients was analyzed, of which 17.66% were admitted to ICUs, and 6.4% of these patients died. Of the patients analyzed, 44.4% required some type of respiratory support. Specifically, 12.8% of patients received invasive mechanical ventilation, while 9.7% received non-invasive mechanical ventilation, and 29.7% received high-flow nasal oxygen. CONCLUSIONS COVID-19 has led to a high number of ICU admissions and a challenge for ICUs is to provide the best ventilatory therapy available to patients admitted. It has been observed that the available figures for ICU admissions and the use of ventilatory therapies are similar across continents. However, the data suggest that geographic areas with higher rates of ICU admission have lower mortality rates. The lack of information in some of the clinical records limits the ability to obtain more conclusive results.","Morales-Cané, I; Del Rocío Valverde-León, M; González-Gancedo, J; Rodríguez-Muñoz, P M; Hidalgo-Lopezosa, P; Rodríguez-Borrego, M A; López-Soto, P J",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202103_25436; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33829459/,135
74021,Quantitative single cell gene expression profiling in the avian embryo.,2015,"Vitamin D deficiency is associated with immune dysregulation, increased vulnerability to infections, depression, and suicidal behavior. One mediator of vitamin D-dependent immune regulation and antimicrobial defense is the cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide (LL-37), encoded by the cathelicidin-related antimicrobial peptide (CRAMP) gene. We compared the mRNA expression of the CRAMP gene, the vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene, as well as the CYP27B1 and CYP24A1 genes (involved in vitamin D metabolism) in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) between depressed individuals who died by suicide (n = 15) and matched (age, gender, and post-mortem interval) non-psychiatric controls (n = 15). Gene expression was measured through qRT-PCR with TaqMan® primers and probes, with GAPDH and β-actin genes as endogenous controls. Statistical analyses included t-tests and Pearson correlations. CRAMP mRNA expression was downregulated and VDR mRNA expression was upregulated in both dlPFC and ACC in suicides relative to controls, with no significant differences in expression of CYP24A1 and CYP27B1. To our knowledge, this is the first study on brain cathelicidin expression in the human brain in relationship to suicide. Increased VDR and decreased CRAMP expression are consistent with previously reported associations between vitamin D deficiency, immune dysregulation, and suicidal behavior, and should lead to future studies uncovering novel interactive targets for suicide prevention.","Postolache, Teodor T; Akram, Faisal; Lee, Ellen E; Lowry, Christopher A; Stiller, John W; Brenner, Lisa A; Streeten, Elizabeth A; Turecki, Gustavo; Dwivedi, Yogesh",Journal of psychiatric research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2020.02.027; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32213352/,135

We developed a set of 10 improved molecular assays for surveillance of GC-AMR and prediction of susceptibilities in NAAT specimens. METHODS Multiplex real-time PCR (RT-PCR) assays were developed to detect SNPs associated with cephalosporin (ponA, porB, mtrR -35delA, penA A311V, penA A501, N513Y, G545S), ciprofloxacin (gyrA S91, parC D86/S87/S88) and azithromycin [23S (A2059G, C2611T), mtrR meningitidis-like promoter] resistance. The assays were validated on 127 gonococcal isolates, 51 non-gonococcal isolates and 50 NAATs with matched culture isolates. SNPs determined from the assay were compared with SNPs determined from in silico analysis of WGS data. MICs were determined for culture isolates using the agar dilution method. RESULTS SNP analysis of the 50 NAAT specimens had 96% agreement with the matched culture RT-PCR analysis. When compared with MICs, presence of penA A311V or penA A501 and two or more other SNPs correlated with decreased susceptibility and presence of three or more other SNPs correlated with intermediate susceptibility to cephalosporins; presence of any associated SNP correlated with ciprofloxacin or azithromycin resistance. NAAT-AMR predictions correlated with matched-culture cephalosporin, ciprofloxacin and azithromycin MICs at 94%, 100% and 98%, respectively.

MATERIALS AND METHODS This single-centre, retrospective, institutional review board-approved study including 43 consecutive patients with 121 metastases treated by WR and 60 patients with 110 metastases treated by RFA between 2007 and 2014 with 23 and 18.5 months of follow-up, respectively. Demographics and tumour characteristics were compared using the unpaired t-test and chi-square test. Predictive factors for LR (lesion size, depth, relation to hepatic vessels, intervention, margin status) were investigated in uni- and multivariate analyses. RESULTS Patient and CRCLM characteristics were similar in both groups. Mean lesion size and depth in the WR and RFA groups were 18 mm and 15 mm (p = 0.03), and 19 mm and 26 mm (p < 0.001), respectively. LR showed a trend towards difference in favour of RFA (19% and 10% in the WR and RFA groups, respectively, p = 0.06). Positive margins and lesion depth were predictive factors of LR in the WR group (p = 0.03 and p = 0.02, respectively, on uni- and multivariable analyses). Lesion depth and proximity to a vein increased the risk of positive margins on pathology after WR (p = 0.04 and p < 0.001, respectively). Our analysis did not identify any predictive factors of LR following RFA. CONCLUSION Our study showed a trend towards a lower LR rate with RFA compared to WR. Lesions located deep in the liver and/or close to large vessels are at high risk of LR following WR, while curative treatment can be obtained with RFA.","Vietti Violi, Naïk; Duran, Rafael; Demartines, Nicolas; Sempoux, Christine; Guiu, Boris; Bize, Pierre E; Sala, Nathalie; Halkic, Nermin; Knebel, Jean-Francois; Denys, Alban","International journal of hyperthermia : the official journal of European Society for Hyperthermic Oncology, North American Hyperthermia Group",https://doi.org/10.1080/02656736.2017.1372644; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29506424/,135
78793,New insights into RNA packaging in porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus.,2011,"PURPOSE Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has gained popularity for treatment of varicose veins. The diameter of the saphenous vein should be considered before RFA because occlusion of the vein may differ depending on its diameter. Until now, however, there have been few data about the correlation between the diameter of the saphenous vein and the stump length after RFA. The purpose of our study was to investigate its correlation. MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective review was performed from prospectively collected data of RFA patients between March 2009 and December 2011. Preoperatively, the saphenous vein diameter was measured. Ablation was initiated 2 cm distal from the junction. Postoperatively, stump length was measured at 1 week and 6 months. After 2 years, we measured the length from the saphenofemoral junction to the leading point of occlusion for great saphenous vein, and length from the saphenopopliteal junction to the leading point of occlusion for small saphenous vein. The paired t-test, independent t-test, and correlation analysis were used for statistical analysis. P-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS During the study period, RFA was performed in 201 patients. Endovenous heat-induced thrombosis developed in 3 patients (1.5%). After 2 years, the stump length was obtained in 74 limbs. The mean diameter and stump length of the saphenous vein were 6.7±1.8 mm and 12.5±8.5 mm, respectively. Correlation analysis showed that the Pearson correlation coefficient of these factors was -0.017.

78934,Infectious bronchitis virus and brown shell colour: Australian strains of infectious bronchitis virus affect brown eggshell colour in commercial laying hens differently.,2016,"BACKGROUND The pathomechanisms of hypoxemia and treatment strategies for type H and type L acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-induced coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have not been elucidated. MAIN TEXT SARS-CoV-2 mainly targets the lungs and blood, leading to ARDS, and systemic thrombosis or bleeding. Angiotensin II-induced coagulopathy, SARS-CoV-2-induced hyperfibrin(ogen)olysis, and pulmonary and/or disseminated intravascular coagulation due to immunothrombosis contribute to COVID-19-associated coagulopathy. Type H ARDS is associated with hypoxemia due to diffuse alveolar damage-induced high right-to-left shunts. Immunothrombosis occurs at the site of infection due to innate immune inflammatory and coagulofibrinolytic responses to SARS-CoV-2, resulting in microvascular occlusion with hypoperfusion of the lungs. Lung immunothrombosis in type L ARDS results from neutrophil extracellular traps containing platelets and fibrin in the lung microvasculature, leading to hypoxemia due to impaired blood flow and a high ventilation/perfusion (VA/Q) ratio. COVID-19-associated ARDS is more vascular centric than the other types of ARDS. D-dimer levels have been monitored for the progression of microvascular thrombosis in COVID-19 patients. Early anticoagulation therapy in critical patients with high D-dimer levels may improve prognosis, including the prevention and/or alleviation of ARDS. CONCLUSIONS Right-to-left shunts and high VA/Q ratios caused by lung microvascular thrombosis contribute to hypoxemia in type H and L ARDS, respectively. D-dimer monitoring-based anticoagulation therapy may prevent the progression to and/or worsening of ARDS in COVID-19 patients.","Gando, Satoshi; Wada, Takeshi",Shock,https://doi.org/10.1097/shk.0000000000001825; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34172612/,135

Although there are reports on antioxidant toxicity, there is no information on the potential toxicity of ALCAR. Here, using zebrafish embryos, we explored whether ALCAR modulated ATP synthesis, generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and expression of specific genes related to major signaling pathways that control metabolism, growth, differentiation, apoptosis and oxidative stress. First, we show that ALCAR elicits a physiologic response, as ATP levels increased after ALCAR treatment. Simultaneously, an increase in the expression of ROS, a by-product of ATP synthesis, was observed in the ALCAR-treated embryos.

89858,Complete genome sequence of a highly prevalent isolate of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus in South China.,2012,"In comparison to European and American countries, Kenya has been less impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in terms of reported cases and mortalities. However, everyday life has been dramatically affected by highly restrictive government-imposed measures such as stay-at-home curfews, prohibitions on mobility across national and county boundaries, and strict policing, especially of the urban poor, which has culminated in violence. This open letter highlights the effects of these measures on how three community-based organizations (CBOs) deliver HIV programs and services to highly stigmatized communities of men who have sex with men living in the counties of Kisumu, Kiambu and Mombasa. In particular, emphasis is placed on how HIV testing programs, which are supported by systematic peer outreach, are being disrupted at a time when global policymakers call for expanded HIV testing and treatment targets among key populations. While COVID 19 measures have greatly undermined local efforts to deliver health services to members and strengthen existing HIV testing programs, each of the three CBOs has taken innovative steps to adapt to the restrictions and to the COVID-19 pandemic itself. Although HIV testing in clinical spaces among those who were once regular and occasional program attendees dropped off noticeably in the early months of the COVID-19 lockdown, the program eventually began to rebound as outreach approaches shifted to virtual platforms and strategies. Importantly and unexpectedly, HIV self-testing kits proved to fill a major gap in clinic-based HIV testing at a time of crisis.","Odinga, Manas Migot; Kuria, Samuel; Muindi, Oliver; Mwakazi, Peter; Njraini, Margret; Melon, Memory; Kombo, Bernadette; Kaosa, Shem; Kioko, Japtheth; Musimbi, Janet; Musyoki, Helgar; Bhattacharjee, Parinita; Lorway, Robert",Gates open research,https://doi.org/10.12688/gatesopenres.13152.2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32954217/,135

93489,Mapping the Nonstructural Protein Interaction Network of Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus.,2018,"UNLABELLED The papain-like protease (PLpro) domain from the deadly Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was overexpressed and purified. MERS-CoV PLpro constructs with and without the putative ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain at the N terminus were found to possess protease, deubiquitinating, deISGylating, and interferon antagonism activities in transfected HEK293T cells. The quaternary structure and substrate preferences of MERS-CoV PLpro were determined and compared to those of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) PLpro, revealing prominent differences between these closely related enzymes. Steady-state kinetic analyses of purified MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV PLpros uncovered significant differences in their rates of hydrolysis of 5-aminomethyl coumarin (AMC) from C-terminally labeled peptide, ubiquitin, and ISG15 substrates, as well as in their rates of isopeptide bond cleavage of K48- and K63-linked polyubiquitin chains. MERS-CoV PLpro was found to have 8-fold and 3,500-fold higher catalytic efficiencies for hydrolysis of ISG15-AMC than for hydrolysis of the Ub-AMC and Z-RLRGG-AMC substrates, respectively. A similar trend was observed for SARS-CoV PLpro, although it was much more efficient than MERS-CoV PLpro toward ISG15-AMC and peptide-AMC substrates. MERS-CoV PLpro was found to process K48- and K63-linked polyubiquitin chains at similar rates and with similar debranching patterns, producing monoubiquitin species. However, SARS-CoV PLpro much preferred K48-linked polyubiquitin chains to K63-linked chains, and it rapidly produced di-ubiquitin molecules from K48-linked chains. Finally, potent inhibitors of SARS-CoV PLpro were found to have no effect on MERS-CoV PLpro. A homology model of the MERS-CoV PLpro structure was generated and compared to the X-ray structure of SARS-CoV PLpro to provide plausible explanations for differences in substrate and inhibitor recognition. IMPORTANCE Unlocking the secrets of how coronavirus (CoV) papain-like proteases (PLpros) perform their multifunctional roles during viral replication entails a complete mechanistic understanding of their substrate recognition and enzymatic activities. We show that the PLpro domains from the MERS and SARS coronaviruses can recognize and process the same substrates, but with different catalytic efficiencies. The differences in substrate recognition between these closely related PLpros suggest that neither enzyme can be used as a generalized model to explain the kinetic behavior of all CoV PLpros. As a consequence, decoding the mechanisms of PLpro-mediated antagonism of the host innate immune response and the development of anti-CoV PLpro enzyme inhibitors will be a challenging undertaking. The results from this study provide valuable information for understanding how MERS-CoV PLpro-mediated antagonism of the host innate immune response is orchestrated, as well as insight into the design of inhibitors against MERS-CoV PLpro.","Báez-Santos, Yahira M; Mielech, Anna M; Deng, Xufang; Baker, Susan; Mesecar, Andrew D",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01294-14; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25142582/,135
94489,Intranasal delivery of an adjuvanted modified live porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus vaccine reduces ROS production.,2011,"Unlike 3C protease, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) 3C-like protease (3CLpro) is only enzymatically active as a homodimer and its catalysis is under extensive regulation by the unique extra domain. Despite intense studies, two puzzles still remain: (i) how the dimer-monomer switch is controlled and (ii) why dimerization is absolutely required for catalysis. Here we report the monomeric crystal structure of the SARS-CoV 3CLpro mutant R298A at a resolution of 1.75 A. Detailed analysis reveals that Arg298 serves as a key component for maintaining dimerization, and consequently, its mutation will trigger a cooperative switch from a dimer to a monomer. The monomeric enzyme is irreversibly inactivated because its catalytic machinery is frozen in the collapsed state, characteristic of the formation of a short 3(10)-helix from an active-site loop. Remarkably, dimerization appears to be coupled to catalysis in 3CLpro through the use of overlapped residues for two networks, one for dimerization and another for the catalysis.","Shi, Jiahai; Sivaraman, J; Song, Jianxing",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02680-07; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18305031/,135

Five types of experimental resin cement were prepared according to UA concentration (0, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 wt%). Flexural strength, film thickness and in vitro cytotoxicity were measured to confirm whether the resin was appropriate under International Organization for Standardization (ISO) criteria. Fifty extracted human molars were prepared, and indirect resin inlays were cemented with experimental resins. Acid-resistant nail varnish was applied, except for the 2-mm area around the restoration. Artificial caries were induced for 6 days through Streptococcus (S.) mutans (ATCC25175). Quantitative light-induced fluorescence (QLF) was used to evaluate the caries progression. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by the Dunnett correction were used to statistically analyze the data. In all groups, the physical property of flexural strength, film thickness, and cytotoxicity were satisfied for ISO criteria (p > 0.05). On ∆F (-%) and ∆Q (-%⋅Px) values as QLF parameters, there was a tendency of being lower in groups of resin cement containing higher concentration of UA. Resin cement containing UA of greater than or equal to 0.5% significantly inhibited caries in the area around restoration (p < 0.05). There was no difference between the groups containing UA of greater than or equal to 0.5%. Resin cement containing 0.5% or more UA showed anti-carious effect in the limited range of 2% and satisfied the ISO criteria for flexural strength, film thickness and cytotoxicity.","Yoo, Hyunkyung; Kim, So Youn; Shin, Su-Jung; Park, Jeong-Won",Odontology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10266-020-00584-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33423144/,135

For implementation of DR strategies, it is essential to get insight in factors that influence implementation. The objective of this study was to evaluate the attitudes and behaviour regarding dose reduction of biologic therapies for psoriasis among psoriasis expert dermatologists worldwide. A 27-question e-survey was sent through the International Psoriasis Council (IPC) to its 114 dermatologist councilors worldwide. The survey assessed demographics, general and DR prescription behaviour, and motivations for and barriers against application of DR. Of 57 respondents, 53 respondents who prescribed biologics were included for analysis. Thirty-seven (69.8%) applied DR (i.e., 'DR dermatologists'), and 16 (30.2%) did not (i.e., 'Non-DR dermatologists'). DR strategies varied among respondents. Regarding criteria for starting DR, differences were reported in required treatment duration, and interpretation and duration of stable low disease activity. In addition, the prolongation of intervals between injections varied between respondents. For most 'DR dermatologists' (n = 32/37, 86.5%), cost savings were one of the main reasons to apply DR. Fifteen out of 16 'Non-DR dermatologists' (94%) did not apply DR due to lack of scientific evidence. In conclusion, DR of biologics for psoriasis is part of clinical practice in psoriasis experts globally. Barriers for applying DR included lack of evidence or guidelines, and uncertainty on DR effects and risks. Although growing evidence shows DR feasibility, future studies are needed to accumulate and broaden evidence, along with development of (inter)national guidelines on DR strategies.","van Muijen, M E; van der Schoot, L S; van den Reek, J M P A; de Jong, E M G J",Archives of dermatological research,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00403-021-02273-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34467442/,135
103116,Complete genome sequence of a variant porcine epidemic diarrhea virus strain isolated in China.,2012,"Beginning in December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), due to 2019-nCoV infection, emerged in Wuhan and spread rapidly throughout China and even worldwide. Employing combined therapy of modern medicine and traditional Chinese medicine has been proposed, in which Ma Xing Shi Gan Decoction (MXSGD) was recommended as a basic prescription and applied widely in the clinical treatment of COVID-19. We investigated the underlying mechanism of MXSGD in treating COVID-19 utilizing the approaches of integrating network pharmacology. A total of 97 active ingredients of MXSGD were screened out, and 169 targets were predicted. The protein-protein interaction network exhibited hub targets of MXSGD, such as Heat shock protein 90, RAC-alpha serine/threonine-protein kinase, Transcription factor AP-1, Mitogen-activated protein kinase 1, Cellular tumor antigen p53, Vascular endothelial growth factor A, and Tumour necrosis factor. Gene Ontology functional enrichment analysis demonstrated that the biological processes altered within the body after taking MXSGD were closely related to the regulation of such processes as the acute inflammatory response, chemokine production, vascular permeability, response to oxygen radicals, oxidative stress-induced apoptosis, T cell differentiation involved in the immune response, immunoglobulin secretion, and extracellular matrix disassembly. KEGG enrichment analysis indicated that the targets of MXSGD were significantly enriched in inflammation-related pathways, immunomodulation-related pathways, and viral infection-related pathways. The therapeutic mechanisms of MXSGD on COVID-19 may primarily involve the following effects: reducing inflammation, suppressing cytokine storm, protecting the pulmonary alveolar-capillary barrier, alleviating pulmonary edema, regulating the immune response, and decreasing fever.","Wang, Y-X; Ma, J-R; Wang, S-Q; Zeng, Y-Q; Zhou, C-Y; Ru, Y-H; Zhang, L; Lu, Z-G; Wu, M-H; Li, H",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202003_20704; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32271454/,135

MATERIAL AND METHODS Confirmed symptomatic cases of COVID-19 were included in the study. Patients were supposed to receive chloroquine (CQ) 500 mg twice daily for 7 days. Due to a change in institutional protocol, initial patients received chloroquine and subsequent patients who did not receive chloroquine served as negative controls. Clinical effectiveness was determined in terms of timing of symptom resolution and conversion rate of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on day 14 and day 15 of admission. RESULTS Twelve COVID-19 patients formed the treatment arm and 17 patients were included in the control arm. The duration of symptoms among the CQ treated group (6.3 ± 2.7 days) was significantly (p-value = 0.009) lower than that of the control group (8.9 ± 2.2 days). There was no significant difference in the rate of RT-PCR negativity in both groups. 2 patients out of 12 developed diarrhea in the CQ therapy arm.

109476,Functional and genetic studies of the substrate specificity of coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus 3C-like proteinase.,2010,"An individual's experience of COPD is determined by many factors in addition to the pathological features of chronic bronchitis and emphysema and the symptoms that derive directly from them. Multimorbidity is the norm rather than the exception, so most people with COPD are living with a range of other medical problems which can decrease overall quality of life. COPD is caused by the inhalation of noxious particles or gases, in particular tobacco smoke, but also by early life disadvantage impairing lung development and by occupations where inhaled exposures are common (e.g. industrial, farming and cleaning work). Wealthy people are therefore relatively protected from developing COPD and people who do develop the condition may have reduced resources to cope. COPD is also no longer a condition that predominantly affects men. The prevalence of COPD among women has equalled that of men since 2008 in many high-income countries, due to increased exposure to tobacco, and in low-income countries due to biomass fuels. COPD is one of the leading causes of death in women in the USA, and death rates attributed to COPD in women in some countries are predicted to overtake those of men in the next decade. Many factors contribute to this phenomenon, but in addition to socioeconomic and occupational factors, there is increasing evidence of a higher susceptibility of females to smoking and pollutants. Quality of life is also more significantly impaired in women. Although most medications (bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids) used to treat COPD demonstrate similar trends for exacerbation prevention and lung function improvement in men and women, this is an understudied area and clinical trials frequently have a preponderance of males. A better understanding of gender-based predictors of efficacy of all therapeutic interventions is crucial for comprehensive patient care. There is an urgent need to recognize the increasing burden of COPD in women and to facilitate global improvements in disease prevention and management in this specific population. Many individuals with COPD follow a trajectory of both lung function decline and also multimorbidity. Unfavourable lung function trajectories throughout life have implications for later development of other chronic diseases. An enhanced understanding of the temporal associations underlying the development of coexisting diseases is a crucial first step in unravelling potential common disease pathways. Lessons can be learned from exploring disease trajectories of other NCD as well as multimorbidity development. Further research will be essential to explain how early life risk factors commonly influence trajectories of COPD and other diseases, how different diseases develop in relation to each other in a temporal way and how this ultimately leads to different multimorbidity patterns in COPD. This review integrates new knowledge and ideas pertaining to three broad themes (i) the overall burden of disease in COPD, (ii) an unappreciated high burden in women and (iii) the contrast of COPD trajectories and different multimorbidity patterns with trajectories of other NCD. The underlying pathology of COPD is largely irreversible, but many factors noted in the review are potentially amenable to intervention. Health and social care systems need to ensure that effective treatment is accessible to all people with the condition. Preventive strategies and treatments that alter the course of disease are crucial, particularly for patients with COPD as one of many problems.","Buttery, Sara C; Zysman, Maéva; Vikjord, Sigrid A A; Hopkinson, Nicholas S; Jenkins, Christine; Vanfleteren, Lowie E G W",Respirology,https://doi.org/10.1111/resp.14032; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33751727/,135

116976,Characterization of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus infectivity in human embryonic kidney cells.,2017,"OBJECTIVES Despite protocols incorporating spontaneous breathing trials, 31% of ICU patients experience difficult or prolonged weaning from mechanical ventilation. Nonfatiguing modes such as pressure support ventilation are recommended. Proportional assist ventilation provides assistance in proportion to patient effort, which may optimize weaning. However, it is not known how proportional assist ventilation performs relative to pressure support ventilation over a prolonged period in the complex ICU setting. The purpose of this study was to compare the physiologic and clinical performance (failure rate), safety, and feasibility of protocols using daily spontaneous breathing trial plus pressure support ventilation versus proportional assist ventilation until ventilation discontinuation. DESIGN Single-center, unblinded pilot randomized controlled trial. SETTING Medical-surgical ICU of a tertiary-care hospital. PATIENTS Adult patients intubated greater than 36 hours were randomized if they met eligibility criteria for partial ventilatory support, tolerated pressure support ventilation greater than or equal to 30 minutes, and either failed or did not meet criteria for a spontaneous breathing trial. INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomized to the pressure support ventilation or proportional assist ventilation protocol (PAV+, Puritan Bennett 840; Covidien, Boulder, CO). Both protocols used progressive decreases in level of assistance as tolerated, coupled with daily assessment for spontaneous breathing trials. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Of 54 patients randomized, outcome data are available for 50 patients; 27 were randomized to receive proportional assist ventilation and 23 to receive pressure support ventilation. There were no adverse events linked to the study interventions, and protocol violations were infrequent. Recruitment was slower than projected (1.3 patients per month). The median (interquartile range) time from randomization to successful extubation was 3.9 days (2.8-8.4 d) on proportional assist ventilation versus 4.9 days (2.9-26.3 d) on pressure support ventilation (p = 0.39). Time to live ICU discharge was 7.3 days (5.2-11.4 d) on proportional assist ventilation versus 12.4 days (7.5-30.8 d) on pressure support ventilation (p = 0.03). CONCLUSION This pilot study demonstrates the utility, safety, and feasibility of the weaning protocols and provides important information to guide the design of a future randomized controlled trial comparing weaning from mechanical ventilation on pressure support ventilation versus proportional assist ventilation.","Bosma, Karen J; Read, Brooke A; Bahrgard Nikoo, Mohammad J; Jones, Philip M; Priestap, Fran A; Lewis, James F",Critical care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/ccm.0000000000001600; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26807682/,135

Subsequently, it aimed to analyze the risks of infusion pumps and to provide a reference for the risk management of this type of device.

This classification is combined with the Trace Intersecting Theory to form a human-machine-environment interaction model. Such a model was applied to the dataset of 2001 to 2017 class I infusion pump recalls extracted from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website. This dataset does not include cases involving illegal factors. RESULTS The proposed model was used for conducting hazard analysis on 70 cases of class I infusion pump recalls by the FDA. According to the analytical results, an important source of product technical risk was that the infusion pumps did not infuse accurate dosage (ie, over- or underdelivery of fluid). In addition, energy hazard and product component failure were identified as the major hazard form associated with infusion pump use and as the main direct cause for adverse events in the studied cases, respectively. CONCLUSIONS The proposed human-machine-environment interaction model, when applied to adverse event data, can help to identify the hazard forms and direct causes of adverse events associated with medical device use.","Gao, Xuemei; Wen, Qiang; Duan, Xiaolian; Jin, Wei; Tang, Xiaohong; Zhong, Ling; Xia, Shitao; Feng, Hailing; Zhong, Daidi",JMIR human factors,https://doi.org/10.2196/10366; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31066695/,135

He had presented at another hospital with left groin pain and inability to weight bear 4 weeks earlier after a fall from standing height, but had delayed treatment due to his insistence on waiting until he returned to his home country.Successful treatment of residual poliomyelitis fractures requires early union as well as early mobilisation and rehabilitation. This patient presented to the orthopaedic surgeons with a challenging case due to the delay in treatment and the fact that the fracture was basicervical which results in an unstable fracture. Surgical expertise was required to decide on the optimum surgical option and a total hip arthroplasty was performed. The patient made a good recovery following physiotherapy as evidenced clinically and radiologically.","BinHussain, Heba; Elzwai, Eman; Fox, Sarah; Langhi, Salem",BMJ case reports,https://doi.org/10.1136/bcr-2020-240221; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34020986/,135

123790,Recombination between Vaccine and Field Strains of Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus.,2019-12-01,"Mucous epithelia are protected by complex mucus barrier layers, which are part of the innate immune defense. Trefoil factor family peptides TFF1, TFF2, and TFF3 have lectin activities and are predominantly co-secreted together with mucins from these epithelia. TFF1 and TFF2 are mainly expressed in the gastric mucosa; whereas TFF3 is rather widely secreted from most mucous epithelia and their glands. TFF1 and TFF3 consist of a single TFF domain and an additional free 7th cysteine residue; whereas TFF2 contains two TFF domains. Systematic analyses of the molecular forms of TFFs gave new insights into their diverse molecular functions. TFF1 mainly exists as a monomer with an unusual free thiol group and only minor amounts form a disulfide linked homodimer as well as heterodimers with gastrokine-2 and IgG-Fc-binding protein (FCGBP). TFF3 mainly forms a heterodimer with FCGBP in vivo, but binds also Deleted in Malignant Brain Tumors/gp340 (DMBT1gp340) in vitro. In contrast, TFF2 binds as a lectin to a conserved O-linked carbohydrate moiety of the mucin MUC6. Both FCGBP and DMBT1gp340 are secreted from most mucous epithelia and their glands and are involved in mucosal innate immunity. Thus, a new picture emerged pointing to functions of TFF3-FCGBP (and TFF1-FCGBP) for mucosal innate immune defense, e.g. supporting the clearing of microorganisms. Such a function could be well be supported by DMBT1gp340. In contrast, the TFF2/MUC6 complex probably stabilizes physically the inner adherent gastric mucus layer. Furthermore, there are indications that TFF3-FCGBP might play also a role in blood vessels.","Hoffmann, Werner",Current medicinal chemistry,https://doi.org/10.2174/0929867328666210215114140; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33588719/,135

These mutations are present in MERS-CoV spike, explaining why MERS-CoV infects human cells. These mutations therefore played critical roles in the bat-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV, either directly or through intermediate hosts.","Yang, Yang; Liu, Chang; Du, Lanying; Jiang, Shibo; Shi, Zhengli; Baric, Ralph S; Li, Fang",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01279-15; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26063432/,135
125002,Genomic and epidemiological characteristics provide new insights into the phylogeographical and spatiotemporal spread of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus in Asia.,2015,"CONTEXT There have been no animal studies of the health effects of repeated inhalation of mixtures representing downwind pollution from coal combustion. Environmental exposures typically follow atmospheric processing and mixing with pollutants from other sources. OBJECTIVE This was the fourth study by the National Environmental Respiratory Center to create a database for responses of animal models to combustion-derived pollutant mixtures, to identify causal pollutants-regardless of source. METHODS F344 and SHR rats and A/J, C57BL/6, and BALB/c mice were exposed 6 h/day 7 days/week for 1 week to 6 months to three concentrations of a mixture simulating key components of ""downwind"" coal combustion emissions, to the highest concentration filtered to remove particulate matter (PM), or to clean air. Emissions from low-sulfur subbituminous coal were modified to create a mixture recommended by an expert workshop. Sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and PM were the dominant components. Nonanimal-derived PM mass concentrations of nominally 0, 100, 300, and 1000 µg/m(3) were mostly partially neutralized sulfate. RESULTS Only 17 of 270 species-gender-time-outcome comparisons were significantly affected by exposure; some models showed no effects. There was strong evidence that PM participated meaningfully in only three responses. CONCLUSION On a total mass or PM mass basis, this mixture was less toxic overall than diesel and gasoline exhausts or wood smoke. The largely sulfate PM contributed to few effects and was the sole cause of none. The study did not allow identification of causal pollutants, but the potential role of NOx in some effects is suggested by the literature.","Mauderly, Joe L; Barrett, Edward G; Gigliotti, Andrew P; McDonald, Jacob D; Reed, Matthew D; Seagrave, JeanClare; Mitchell, Leah A; Seilkop, Steven K",Inhalation toxicology,https://doi.org/10.3109/08958378.2011.572932; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21605010/,135

This is due to several factors, including increased air travel and uncontrolled mosquito vector populations. Emergence can involve simple spillover from enzootic (wildlife) cycles, as in the case of West Nile virus accompanying geographic expansion into the Americas; secondary amplification in domesticated animals, as seen with Japanese encephalitis, Venezuelan equine encephalitis, and Rift Valley fever viruses; and urbanization, in which humans become the amplification hosts and peridomestic mosquitoes, mainly Aedes aegypti, mediate human-to-human transmission. Dengue, yellow fever, chikungunya, and Zika viruses have undergone such urban emergence. We focus mainly on the latter two, which are recent arrivals in the Western Hemisphere. We also discuss a few other viruses with the potential to emerge through all of these mechanisms.","Weaver, Scott C; Charlier, Caroline; Vasilakis, Nikos; Lecuit, Marc",Annual review of medicine,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-med-050715-105122; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28846489/,135

125956,Antigenic relationships among porcine epidemic diarrhea virus and transmissible gastroenteritis virus strains.,2015,"Methods with which to tailor the morphology of polystyrene-based emulsion-templated (PolyHIPE) materials are presented. Increasing the temperature of the aqueous phase used to prepare the parent emulsion leads to an increase in average void and interconnect size in the resulting porous material. Additionally, the presence in the aqueous phase of small quantities of organic additives that are capable of partitioning between the two emulsion phases also affects the morphology of the porous material obtained. The additives examined were tetrahydrofuran (THF), methanol and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), all of which were found to increase the average void and interconnect diameters. It is suggested that THF and, to a lesser extent, PEG enhance Ostwald ripening, resulting in emulsion coarsening over time. Evidence for this was gleaned from NMR experiments to determine the rates of water diffusion in each emulsion. However, methanol was shown not to affect the rate of water diffusion. An alternative mechanism by which methanol could affect the emulsion stability is by depleting surfactant from the interface. However, higher levels of surfactant in emulsions containing methanol did not have a significant effect on morphology. To explain this, we suggest that methanol may result in depletion of surfactant from the emulsion interface, however additional surfactant serves not only to replace this depleted surfactant but also to increase the number of w/o micelles in the continuous phase. These facilitate transport of water between droplets, thus negating the effect of replacing the surfactant lost from the interface.","Carnachan, Ross J; Bokhari, Maria; Przyborski, Stefan A; Cameron, Neil R",Soft matter,https://doi.org/10.1039/b603211g; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32680240/,135
126632,The trypsin-enhanced infection of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus is determined by the S2 subunit of the spike glycoprotein.,2021-03-10,"OBJECTIVES This study investigated whether comatose patients with greater duration and magnitude of clinically observed mean arterial pressure outside optimal mean arterial blood pressure have worse outcomes than those with mean arterial blood pressure closer to optimal mean arterial blood pressure calculated by bedside multimodal cerebral autoregulation monitoring using near-infrared spectroscopy. DESIGN Prospective observational study. SETTING Neurocritical Care Unit of the Johns Hopkins Hospital. SUBJECTS Acutely comatose patients secondary to brain injury. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS The cerebral oximetry index was continuously monitored with near-infrared spectroscopy for up to 3 days. Optimal mean arterial blood pressure was defined as that mean arterial blood pressure at the lowest cerebral oximetry index (nadir index) for each 24-hour period of monitoring. Kaplan-Meier analysis and proportional hazard regression models were used to determine if survival at 3 months was associated with a shorter duration of mean arterial blood pressure outside optimal mean arterial blood pressure and the absolute difference between clinically observed mean arterial blood pressure and optimal mean arterial blood pressure. A total 91 comatose patients were enrolled in the study. The most common etiology was intracerebral hemorrhage. Optimal mean arterial blood pressure could be calculated in 89 patients (97%), and the median optimal mean arterial blood pressure was 89.7 mm Hg (84.6-100 mm Hg). In multivariate proportional hazard analysis, duration outside optimal mean arterial blood pressure of greater than 80% of monitoring time (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.13; 95% CI, 1.04-4.41; p = 0.04) and absolute difference between clinically observed mean arterial blood pressure and optimal mean arterial blood pressure of more than 10 mm Hg (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.44; 95% CI, 1.21-4.92; p = 0.013) were independently associated with mortality at 3 months, after adjusting for brain herniation, admission Glasgow Coma Scale, duration on vasopressors and midline shift at septum. CONCLUSIONS Comatose neurocritically ill adults with an absolute difference between clinically observed mean arterial blood pressure and optimal mean arterial blood pressure greater than 10 mm Hg and duration outside optimal mean arterial blood pressure greater than 80% had increased mortality at 3 months. Noninvasive near-infrared spectroscopy-based bedside calculation of optimal mean arterial blood pressure is feasible and might be a promising tool for cerebral autoregulation oriented-therapy in neurocritical care patients.","Rivera-Lara, Lucia; Geocadin, Romergryko; Zorrilla-Vaca, Andres; Healy, Ryan J; Radzik, Batya R; Palmisano, Caitlin; Mirski, Marek; White, Mirinda Anderson; Suarez, Jose; Brown, Charles; Hogue, Charles W; Ziai, Wendy",Critical care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/ccm.0000000000003908; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31356469/,135

METHODS After clinical and MRI examination, 16 out of 59 consecutive patients with moderate or severe instability after simple elbow dislocation were addressed to surgical treatment. There were 14 men and 2 women. The mean age was 39.6 years (range 16-69 years). RESULTS MRI showed full-thickness lesion of MCL in 9/16 patients (53.3%) and partial lesion in 6/16 patients (40%), and in 1 case, the MCL was considered intact. On the lateral side, MRI showed complete injury of LCL in 7/16 patients (46.6%) and partial injury in 7/16 patients (40%). No lesions of LCL were observed in 2 patients (13.4%). MCL was surgically explored in all the patients. We observed 10/16 full-thickness lesions (62.5%) and 6/16 partial lesions (37.5%). LCL was surgically explored in 11/16 patients. We observed 6/11 full-thickness lesions (54.6%) and 5/11 partial lesions (45.4%). In 3 cases, associated soft tissue injuries were detected. The rate of concordance between MRI and surgical findings was 87.5% (14/16 cases) on the medial side and 90.9% (10/11 cases) on the lateral side. CONCLUSION Our study demonstrated that MRI is a reliable and useful tool to investigate collateral ligaments and soft tissue injuries around the elbow and to plan the most adequate surgical treatment.","Dutto, E; Artiaco, S; Gallo, A; Borré, A; Sard, A; Battiston, B",Musculoskeletal surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12306-020-00678-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32803410/,135

STUDY DESIGN A prospective cohort study of 20 randomly selected OSA patients. METHODS Fifteen of 20 patients were able to complete spontaneous sleep during MRI. While asleep, dynamic MR images of pharynx were obtained in the midline sagittal view. During the scan, nasal and oral airflow, thoracoabdominal wall effort, and electroencephalogram were synchronously recorded. The physiologic data were retrospectively scored to identify periods of apneas and synchronized with dynamic MR images. RESULTS In all 15 patients, the site of complete airway obstruction occurred at the retropalatal space. We noticed different positions of the soft palate during apneic events. In seven of 15 patients (47%), the soft palate was attached to the tongue base and moved backward, compressing the airway. In five of 15 patients (33%), the soft palate was detached from the tongue base and solely moved backward, compressing the airway. In three patients (20%), we recorded both mechanisms of complete airway obstruction. In cases with attached soft palate to the tongue base, we noticed significant narrowing of the retrolingual space during apneic events. CONCLUSION We describe a novel mechanism of obstruction dependent on the position of soft palate. This mechanism might play an important role in selecting candidates for surgery or treatment with hypoglossal nerve stimulation.

130498,Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus Infection Inhibits Interferon Signaling by Targeted Degradation of STAT1.,2016,"BACKGROUND Surgeons frequently use optical loupes to magnify the surgical field; they are typically unprotected when positioned directly over the wound, where particulate shedding containing microorganisms could potentially lead to surgical site infections (SSIs). SSIs are rare in some orthopaedic subspecialties such as hand surgery; however, in other subspecialties, for example, the spine, where surgeons often use loupes, SSIs can have devastating consequences. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES (1) What is the degree of bacterial and fungi organism colonization of surgical loupes and storage cases? (2) Is there a difference in the degree of colonization at the beginning and the end of a surgery day? (3) Does an alcohol swab reduce bacterial colonization of surgical loupes? METHODS The surgical loupes of 21 orthopaedic surgeons from a large, regional orthopaedic practice were cultured over a 3-month period and form the basis of this study. Five loupe storage cases were also cultured. In two different subgroup comparisons, the presence of microorganisms was evaluated just before the start and immediately after the end of the surgical day (n = 9) and before and 1 minute after cleaning with an alcohol swab (n = 6). A total of 36 cultures were evaluated. Surgeons who declined to participate in the study were excluded. The number of loupes selected for all of the analyses were samples of convenience and limited by surgeon availability. The degree of bacterial and fungal presence was graded using a point system: 0 = no growth; 1 = limited growth (meaning few scattered colonies); 2 = moderate growth; 3 = extensive but scattered growth; and 4 = growth consuming the entire plate. Demographic data were assessed using descriptive statistics. Additionally, the Student's t and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to detect differences in categorical bacterial growth between paired samples. A p value of 0.05 represented statistical significance. Kappa statistics of reliability were performed to evaluate interobserver agreement of microorganism growth in the culture plates. RESULTS Bacteria were present in 19 of 21 (90%) sets of loupes. Five species of bacteria were noted. Fungi were present in 10 of 21 (48%) sets of loupes. Bacterial contamination was identified in two storage cases (40%) and fungi were present in five cases (100%). In a subset of nine loupes tested, the degree of bacterial presence had a median of 2 (range, 1-4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.0-2.6) in samples collected before starting the surgical day compared with 3 (range, 2-4; 95% CI, 2.0-3.3) at the end of the day (p = 0.004). In a separate study arm comprised of six loupes, 1 minute after being cleaned with an alcohol swab, bacterial presence on loupes decreased from a median of 2 (range, 2-3; 95% CI, 1.9-2.5) to a median of 1 (range, 0-2; 95% CI, 0.5-1.5; p = 0.012). CONCLUSIONS Loupes are a common reservoir for bacteria and fungi. Given the use of loupes directly over the surgical field and the lack of a barrier, care should be taken to decrease the bacterial load by cleaning loupes and airing out storage cases, which may decrease the risk of surgical field contamination and iatrogenic wound infections. CLINICAL RELEVANCE Routine cleaning and disinfecting of optical loupes with alcohol pads can reduce microorganism colonization and should be implemented by surgeons who regularly use loupes in the operating room. Theoretically, particulate shedding from the loupes into the surgical field containing microorganisms could increase the risk of SSI, although this has not been proven clinically.","Graham, Jack G; Chen, Antonia F; Hickok, Noreen J; Knott, Samantha; Purtill, Caroline; Martin, Dennis; Beredjiklian, Pedro K",Clinical orthopaedics and related research,https://doi.org/10.1097/corr.0000000000000651; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30801279/,135

METHODS Sixty severe COVID-19 patients admitted to Changsha Public Health Treatment Center (North Hospital of the First Hospital of Changsha City) from January to March in 2020 were randomly divided into routine treatment group, Xuebijing 50 mL group and Xuebijing 100 mL group, with 20 cases in each group. The routine treatment group was treated according to the National Health Commission's guide for COVID-19. On the basis of conventional treatment, Xuebijing injection was injected by 50 mL twice a day for 7 days in Xuebijing 50 mL group, while by 100 mL twice a day for 7 days in Xuebijing 100 mL group. The blood routine test, C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II) score, 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) nucleic acid test and disease classification of three groups before and 8 days after treatment were observed. RESULTS (1) After treatment, the white blood cell count (WBC) and lymphocyte count (LYM) of three groups increased, meanwhile CRP and ESR decreased. Compared with routine treatment group, the WBC count of Xuebijing 100 mL group after treatment significantly increased (×109/L: 7.12±0.55 vs. 5.67±0.51, P < 0.05), and the levels of CRP and ESR in Xuebijing 50 mL and 100 mL groups significantly decreased [CRP (mg/L): 32.3±4.6, 28.0±6.2 vs. 37.3±5.9; ESR (mm/1 h): 45.9±5.7, 40.5±7.4 vs. 55.3±6.6, all P < 0.05]. Compared with Xuebijing 50 mL group, the increase of WBC, and the decrease of CRP and ESR were more significant in Xuebijing 100 mL group [WBC (×109/L): 7.12±0.55 vs. 5.82±0.49, CRP (mg/L): 28.0±6.2 vs. 32.3±4.6, ESR (mm/1 h): 40.5±7.4 vs. 45.9±5.7, all P < 0.05]. (2) After treatment, the APACHE II score of three groups decreased. In Xuebijing 100 mL group, the APACHE II score after treatment was significantly lower than those in routine treatment and Xuebijing 50 mL groups (12.3±1.5 vs. 16.5±1.6, 15.9±1.4, both P < 0.05). After treatment, the 2019-nCoV nucleic acid test in three groups partly turned negative, with 9 cases in routine treatment group, 8 cases in Xuebijing 50 mL group and 9 cases in Xuebijing 100 mL group, without significant difference (P > 0.05). The conditions of patients in the three groups were improved after treatment, among them, 8 cases in the routine treatment group were transformed into common type, 1 case into critical type; 9 cases and 12 cases of Xuebijing 50 mL group and 100 mL group were transformed into common type respectively. Xuebijing 100 mL group was improved more obviously than Xuebijing 50 mL group and routine treatment group (both P < 0.05).

134569,Identification of B-cell epitopes in the NSP1 protein of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus.,2012,"BACKGROUND Periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) is a devastating complication following total joint arthroplasty (TJA). Now, the definition of PJI traditionally used in clinical practice was set out by the International Consensus Meeting (ICM) and Infectious Diseases Society (IDSA). There was a new definition proposed in May 2018 on a paper published in the Journal of Arthroplasty. The new scoring system for PJI demonstrated a higher sensitivity and specificity than Musculoskeletal Infection Society and IDSA criteria. Therefore, we wanted to find further evidence to support the new definition in the Chinese population. METHODS The patients who were included in our study were divided into PJI group and aseptic group. Medical records of patients (98 in PJI group and 165 in aseptic group) were reviewed, and the score of every patient was aggregated based on the new definition and collected data. The sensitivity and specificity were compared between new definition and classical criteria. RESULTS For patients in our hospital, the overall sensitivity and specificity of the new criteria were respectively 94.9% (95% confidence interval [CI] 87.9-98.1%) and 95.2% (95% CI 90.3-97.7%). The new definition demonstrated a higher sensitivity than traditional criteria in Chinese population, and the specificity was similar to existing criteria. CONCLUSION We believe the new scoring system about periprosthetic joint infection could also apply to Chinese population for diagnosing PJI following TJA. It can obviously improve diagnostic efficiency for PJI compared with traditional criteria.","Guan, Haitao; Fu, Jun; Li, Xiang; Chai, Wei; Hao, Libo; Li, Rui; Zhao, Jing; Chen, Jiying",Journal of orthopaedic surgery and research,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13018-019-1185-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31126290/,135

The first cell culture products (viral vaccines) relied largely on the use of in vitro and in vivo virus screening assays that were based upon infectivity of adventitious viral agents. The use of Cohn fractionation and pasteurization by manufacturers of plasma derivatives introduced the concepts that purification and treatment with physical and chemical agents could greatly reduce the risk of viral contamination of human albumin and immunoglobulin products. But the limitations of such approaches became clear for thermolabile products that were removed early in fractionation such as antihemophilic factors, which transmitted hepatitis viruses and HIV-1 to some product recipients. These successes and limitations were taken into account by the early developers of recombinant DNA (rDNA)-derived cell culture products and by regulatory agencies, leading to the utilization of cloning technology to reduce/eliminate contamination due to human viruses and purification technologies to physically remove and inactivate adventitious and endogenous viruses, along with cell banking and cell bank characterization for adventitious and endogenous viruses, viral screening of biological raw materials, and testing of cell culture harvests, to ensure virus safety. Later development and incorporation of nanofiltration technology in the manufacturing process provided additional assurance of viral clearance for safety of biotechnology products. These measures have proven very effective at preventing iatrogenic infection of recipients of biotechnology products; however, viral contamination of production cell cultures has occasionally occurred. Screening tests for viral contamination in raw materials have not proven practical by themselves to prevent contamination of cell cultures, but they can be made more effective by coupling with treatment using physical or chemical agents to further reduce the hypothetical viral loads present in cell culture raw materials. Recent advances in polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology have allowed preharvest testing for specific viral agents to reduce the risk of cell culture contamination by specific viruses in the harvest material. Examples of each of these stages in the evolution of virus detection methods are described and assessed in this paper.","Lubiniecki, Anthony S",PDA journal of pharmaceutical science and technology,https://doi.org/10.5731/pdajpst.2011.00818; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22294576/,135
140076,Swine Dendritic Cell Response to Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus: An Update.,2021,"Introduction Medical schools are now required to address health disparities within their curriculum, with a recent emphasis on social determinants of health (SDOH). However, there is scant evidence that incorporating educational experiences around SDOH impacts health equity for patients. The COVID-19 pandemic provided a unique setting to engage students to address SDOH directly with patients. Methods The authors designed a service-learning experience in which medical students conducted a patient needs assessment survey by phone to assess SDOH in the domains of health care access, economic stability, and social cohesion. We drew descriptive statistics from a deidentified Excel database of call outcomes to quantify health care interactions and community resource referrals generated by callers. Results The call outcomes revealed unmet health and social needs among the patient population and generated a substantial number of actions to improve health care access and awareness of community resources. Conclusion The results of this project show that employing medical students to engage with SDOH through action-oriented service learning positively impacts health care access and referrals to community resources. This initiative provides a flexible model to engage medical trainees in addressing health-related social needs that can be applied to a range of clinical settings and learner levels.","Bickerton, Lucy; Siegart, Nicolle; Marquez, Crystal",PRiMER,https://doi.org/10.22454/primer.2020.225894; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33111054/,135

Although POM is readily used by aquatic fungi and bacteria, there is a limited understanding of POM-associated interactions between these taxa, particularly for early-diverging fungal lineages. Using a model ecological system with the chitin-degrading freshwater chytrid fungus Rhizoclosmatium globosum and chitin microbeads, we assessed the impacts of chytrid fungi on POM-associated bacteria. We show that the presence of chytrids on POM alters concomitant bacterial community diversity and structure, including differing responses between chytrid life stages. We propose that chytrids can act as ecosystem facilitators through saprotrophic feeding by producing 'public goods' from POM degradation that modify bacterial POM communities. This study suggests that chytrid fungi have complex ecological roles in aquatic POM degradation not previously considered, including the regulation of bacterial colonization, community succession and subsequent biogeochemical potential.","Roberts, Cordelia; Allen, Ro; Bird, Kimberley E; Cunliffe, Michael",Biology letters,https://doi.org/10.1098/rsbl.2020.0368; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32991826/,135

During post-mortem, multiple nodules were noted on the wing membranes, and therefore degenerate PCR primers targeting the poxvirus DNA polymerase gene were used to screen for poxviruses. The poxvirus PCR screen was positive and sequencing of the PCR product demonstrated very low, but significant, similarity with the DNA polymerase gene from members of the Poxviridae family. Next-generation sequencing of DNA extracted from the lesions returned a contig of 132 353 nucleotides (nt), which was further extended to produce a near full-length viral genome of 133 492 nt. Analysis of the genome revealed it to be AT-rich with inverted terminal repeats of at least 1314 nt and to contain 143 predicted genes. The genome contains a surprisingly large number (29) of genes not found in other poxviruses, one of which appears to be a homologue of the mammalian TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) gene. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that the poxvirus described here is not closely related to any other poxvirus isolated from bats or other species, and that it likely should be placed in a new genus.","O'Dea, Mark A; Tu, Shin-Lin; Pang, Stanley; De Ridder, Thomas; Jackson, Bethany; Upton, Chris",The Journal of general virology,https://doi.org/10.1099/jgv.0.000538; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27389615/,135

With the COVID-19 pandemic, the opportunity for adoption of novel technology is more relevant. The aims are to assess the technology available, to understand the current evidence regarding the benefit and to consider challenges to implementation in clinical practice. Methods & results PRISMA guidelines were used to filter the literature. Of 1004 articles returned the following exclusion criteria were applied: 1) reviews/commentaries 2) unrelated to orthopaedic surgery 3) use of other AR wearables beyond visual aids leaving 42 papers for review.This review illustrates benefits including enhanced accuracy and reduced time of surgery, reduced radiation exposure and educational benefits. Conclusion Whilst there are obstacles to overcome, there are already reports of technology being used. As with all novel technologies, a greater understanding of the learning curve is crucial, in addition to shielding our patients from this learning curve.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Of 284 patients undergoing surgery for EAC between 2003 and 2013, the 153 selected with locally advanced EAC were 74 MIEs and 79 OEs [median age, 66 for MIE, 63 for OE (p = 0.009)]. Neoadjuvant therapy was given to 82% of MIEs and 78% of OEs. In the OE group, 86% was male, and in the MIE group, 78%. Data assessed were oncologic, intraoperative, and postoperative. RESULTS Mortality at 30 days was 3% for MIE and 1% for OE; and 90-day mortality was 4% for MIE and 5% for OE. The complication rate for MIE was 50%, and 60% for OE (p = 0.181). The pneumonia rate was 18% for MIE and 19% for OE; leak rate was 7% for MIE and 6% for OE; conduit necrosis was 0 for MIE and 3% for OE; and rate of airway-conduit fistula was 3% for MIE and 1 % for OE. Median blood loss (MIE 300 vs. OE 800, p < 0.0001), overall stay (MIE 13 vs. OE 14, p = 0.040), and harvested lymph nodes (MIE 20 vs. OE 22, p = 0.021) all were in favor of MIE. Median ICU stay and operative time did not differ. Neither did overall (OS) nor recurrence-free (RFS) 3-year survival differs significantly (MIE 64% vs. OS OE 49%, MIE 57% vs. RFS OE 53%). CONCLUSIONS In our institution, MIE appears to produce oncologic and survival results similar to those of OE. Shorter length of stay and less operative blood loss may reduce costs for MIE.","Kauppi, Juha; Räsänen, Jari; Sihvo, Eero; Huuhtanen, Riikka; Nelskylä, Kaisa; Salo, Jarmo",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-014-3978-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25480610/,135

Preliminary data are presented from a prospective trial (n=21). Twelve patients were identified with 17 venous leg ulcers (VLU) and nine bearing 13 nonvenous lower-extremity ulcers. Before enrollment, the patients were evaluated for vascular status and received appropriate surgical intervention to optimize arterial and venous circulatory status. None of the ulcers had responded to a variety of standard treatments from 4 months to 53 years. Initial ulcer size ranged from 0.7 to 65 cm(2) (mean, 11.2 cm(2)). Each PRFM-treated patient received up to three applications of either a 35 or 50 mm fenestrated membrane, depending on initial ulcer size. The primary endpoints were percent and rate of complete closure as measured by digital photography, computerized planimetery, and clinical examination. Patients were followed weekly for 12 weeks with a follow-up visit at 16 weeks. At each 4-week interval, the extent of healing was assessed, and those patients with >50% reduction in wound area were allowed to continue to complete closure. Patients with <50% closure received repeated applications. Complete closure was achieved in 66.7% of the VLU patients (64.7% of treated ulcers) in 7.1 weeks (median, 6 weeks) with an average of two applications per patient. Forty-four percent complete closure was seen with non-VLU patients (31% of treated ulcers). From the results of this small-scale pilot study, PRFM shows significant potential for closing of chronic leg ulcers.","O'Connell, Sean M; Impeduglia, Theresa; Hessler, Karen; Wang, Xiu-Jie; Carroll, Richard J; Dardik, Herbert",Wound repair and regeneration : official publication of the Wound Healing Society [and] the European Tissue Repair Society,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1524-475x.2008.00426.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19128245/,135

These compounds reach wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) through sewerage system and are not sufficiently removed by using conventional treatment process. Psychiatric drugs released with WWTP effluent may cause possible risks to the receiving aquatic environment. Also, two antidepressants have been included in the ""watch list"" in 2020. Therefore, simple and relatively cost effective removal of psychiatric drugs from wastewaters becomes important. Magnetite red mud nanoparticles (RM-NPs) synthesized was applied for the removal of psychiatric drugs (fluoxetine, paroxetine, carbamazepine, diazepam, and lorazepam) in WWTP effluent first time in this study. The adsorption of carbamazepine as a model compound was fitted well with pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The Freundlich isotherm model better represented the sorption data than the Langmuir model. High adsorption capacity (90.5 mg/g) was reached at 30 min contact time at pH 6.5-7.0 at 25 °C. The adsorption rate was described by the pseudo second order model and its rate control mechanism was controlled by film diffusion. The magnetite RM-NPs were efficiently used for the removal of carbamazepine from real WWTP effluents. The adsorption capacity and the magnetic separability of the regenerated magnetite RM-NPs were unaffected five cycles. Due to its simple application, low cost and high adsorption capacity, magnetite RM-NPs can be recommended as a better adsorbent comparing to commercial adsorbents to remove psychiatric drugs from WWTP effluents.","Aydın, Senar; Bedük, Fatma; Ulvi, Arzu; Aydın, Mehmet Emin",The Science of the total environment,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.147174; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33905924/,135

The aim of this study was to evaluate the biodistribution profiles of a series of newly developed diarylpyrazole-based NTR1 antagonists regarding their suitability as diagnostic and potentially radiotherapeutic agents. METHODS 3BP-227, 3BP-228, and 3BP-483 were labeled with (111)In and injected intravenously into NTR1-positive HT29 xenograft-bearing nude mice. At 3, 6, 12, and 24 h after administration, SPECT/CT images were acquired or mice were sacrificed for ex vivo determination of tissue-associated radioactivity. RESULTS High-contrast tumor visualization in SPECT/CT images was achieved using the 3 compounds of this study. Ex vivo biodistribution studies confirmed a high and persistent tumor uptake, peaking at 6 h after injection for (111)In-3BP-227 (8.4 ± 3.1 percentage injected dose per gram [%ID/g]) and at 3 h after injection for (111)In-3BP-228 (10.2 ± 5.3 %ID/g) and (111)In-3BP-483 (1.9 ± 0.8 %ID/g). Tumor-to-normal-tissue ratios obtained with (111)In-3BP-227 and (111)In-3BP-228 were consistently greater than 1.

ICH from systemic thrombolysis typically occurs within the first 24-36 hours of treatment initiation and is characterized by rapid hematoma development and growth. Pathophysiological mechanisms of revascularization therapy-induced ICH are complex and involve a combination of several distinct processes, including the direct effect of thrombolytic agents, disruption of the blood-brain barrier secondary to ischemia, and direct vessel damage from wire and microcatheter manipulations during endovascular procedures. Several definitions of ICH secondary to thrombolysis currently exist, depending on clinical or radiological characteristics used. Multiple studies have investigated clinical and laboratory risk factors associated with higher rates of ICH in this setting. Early ischemic changes seen on noncontrast CT scanning are strongly associated with higher rates of hemorrhage. Modern imaging techniques, particularly CT perfusion, provide rapid assessment of hemodynamic parameters of the brain. Specific patterns of CT perfusion maps can help identify patients who are likely to benefit from revascularization or to develop hemorrhagic complications. There are no established guidelines that describe management of revascularization therapy-induced ICH, and great variability in treatment protocols currently exist. General principles that apply to the management of spontaneous ICH might not be as effective for revascularization therapy-induced ICH. In this article, the authors review current knowledge of risk factors and radiological predictors of ICH secondary to stroke revascularization techniques and analyze medical and surgical management strategies for ICH in this setting.","Mokin, Maxim; Kan, Peter; Kass-Hout, Tareq; Abla, Adib A; Dumont, Travis M; Snyder, Kenneth V; Hopkins, L Nelson; Siddiqui, Adnan H; Levy, Elad I",Neurosurgical focus,https://doi.org/10.3171/2012.1.focus11352; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22463112/,135

157565,ATPase and helicase activities of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus nsp13.,2021-04-26,"While combustible cigarette smoking has declined, the use of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) has increased. ENDS are popular among adolescents, and chemical flavorants are an increasing concern due to the growing use of zero-nicotine flavored e-liquids. Despite this, little is known regarding the effects of ENDS flavorants on vaping-related behavior. Following previous studies demonstrating the green apple flavorant, farnesol, enhances nicotine reward and exhibits rewarding properties without nicotine, this work focuses on the green apple flavorant, farnesene, for its impact on vaping-related behaviors. Using adult C57BL/6J mice, genetically modified to contain fluorescent nicotine acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), and farnesene doses of 0.1, 1.0, and 10 mg/kg, we observed farnesene-alone produces reward-related behavior in both male and female mice. We then performed whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology and observed farnesene-induced inward currents in ventral tegmental area (VTA) putative dopamine neurons that were blocked by the nAChR antagonist, DhβE. While the amplitudes of farnesene-induced currents are ∼30% of nicotine's efficacy, this indicates the potential for some ENDS flavorants to stimulate nAChR function. Additionally, farnesene enhances nicotine's potency for activating nAChRs on VTA dopamine neurons. This may be due to changes in nAChR stoichiometry as our data suggests a shift toward high-sensitivity α4β2 nAChRs. Consequently, these data show that the green apple flavorant, farnesene, causes reward-related behavior without nicotine through changes in nAChR stoichiometry that results in an enhanced effect of nicotine on VTA dopamine neurons. These results demonstrate the importance of future investigations into ENDS flavorants and their effects on vaping-related behaviors.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Although combustible cigarette use has decreased by ∼11% in America over the past two decades, the use of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) has increased by 135% and 218% among high school and middle school students, respectively, in the last two years alone (Cullen et al., 2018; 2019). Due to the fact that most ENDS users vape flavored nicotine products and the growing use of zero-nicotine flavored e-liquids, it raises the questions of how chemical flavorants alter nicotine addiction and if they increase abuse liability themselves. We show that one chemical flavorant and odorant of green apple, farnesene, causes reward-related behavior on its own. These results increase our understanding on how flavorants promote neurological changes and affect nicotine addiction.","Cooper, Skylar Y; Akers, Austin T; Henderson, Brandon J",eNeuro,https://doi.org/10.1523/eneuro.0172-20.2020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32747456/,135

We aimed to describe high-risk behaviours and clinical characteristics by adherence status and to identify the factors associated with non-adherence. We included 426 people living with HIV (PLWH) currently or previously involved in HAART. Most participants were men (75.4%), young (33.6 years), with low income and low education levels. Non-adherent PLWH (11.5%) were more likely to have a larger number of sex partners (p-value = 0.053), sex without condom use (p-value = 0.007) and not receive result at hospital or voluntary test centre (p-value = 0.001). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that demographic (education levels), sexual risk behaviours (multiple sex partners and sex without using condom) and clinical characteristics (time and facility at first time received HIV-positive result) were associated with HAART non-adherence. There are differences in associated factors between women (education levels and place of HIV testing) and men (multiple sex partners). Gender-specific programs, changing risky behaviours and reducing harms among PLWH may benefit adherence. We highlight the need to improve the quantity and quality of HIV/AIDS services in Vietnam, especially in pre- and post-test counselling, to achieve better HAART adherence, working towards ending AIDS in 2030.","Le, Phuong M; Nguyen, Phuong T; Nguyen, Huy V; Bui, Duc H; Vo, Son H; Nguyen, Nga V; Nguyen, Tien V; Tran, Anh Tn; Le, Anh Dm; Ha, Nguyet Mt; Dao, An Tm; Gilmour, Stuart",International journal of STD & AIDS,https://doi.org/10.1177/09564624211002405; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33861666/,135

Laboratory test results showed that the lymphocyte counts progressively decreased [0.85 (0.5-1.6) ×10(9)/L,0.51 (0.4-0.9) ×10(9)/L and 0.43 (0.47-0.61) ×10(9)/L, respectively], while LDH [162 (145.1-203.5) U/L,265 (195.3-288.4) U/L and 387 (312.3-415.5) U/L, respectively] and D-dimer [0.15 (0.09-0.40) mg/L,0.4 (0.2-0.6) mg/L and 0.9 (0.5-1.4) mg/L, respectively] were significantly increased (P<0.05), in all the 3 groups. The levels of IL-6 [(43.2±15.4) μg/L, (78.5±31.2) μg/L and (132.4±47.9) μg/L, respectively] and IL-10 [(3.5±3.2) μg/L, (7.6±6.4) μg/L and (9.4±7.2) μg/L respectively] increased significantly with disease severity. Pulmonary imaging of ordinary patients mainly showed unilateral or bilateral multiple infiltrates, while severe and critically ill patients showed diffuse exudation and consolidation of both lungs, and a few patients showed signs of ""white lungs"". Conclusions: Patients with COVID-19 has a definite history of contact with diagnosed patients, and has family aggregation. The clinical symptoms were mainly fever and dry cough. Laboratory results showed that lymphocyte count, LDH, D-dimer, interleukin-6 and interleukin-10 levels had a significant correlation with the severity of the disease, which could be used as markers for disease progression and prognosis. Pulmonary imaging showed unilateral or bilateral ground glass infiltration. In severe and critically ill patients, diffuse infiltration and consolidation or even ""white lung"" were present.","Zeng, Y L; Zhang, C; Gao, F; Ma, L; Ding, G G; Guo, E E; Zhang, X J; Shang, J; Kang, Y",Zhonghua jie he he hu xi za zhi = Zhonghua jiehe he huxi zazhi = Chinese journal of tuberculosis and respiratory diseases,https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn112147-20200225-00184; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32727176/,135

Though oil will remain an important energy resource in the global energy balance, in the long run renewables will become the leading energy. The European Union and China are the leaders in implementation of energy transition strategies from fossil to clean energy. The transformation in the energy market has affected dramatically the relations between producers and consumers, who now actively determine the consumption trends (for example, green energy, electric vehicles, etc.). Distributed generation and blockchain in power industry enable the consumers to play an active part in the electricity production and distribution chains. Digital transformation and climate agenda are changing the structure of energy business from vertically integrated companies to knowledge-intensive networks. Investors almost unanimously vote for renewable energy. The largest oil and gas companies change their long-term strategies and transform into energy holdings with the prevailing share of renewables in the business structure. Hydrogen attracts particular attention as a promising energy source. The EU plans to develop hydrogen transport infrastructure.

We check whether the country and industry in which companies operate, government financial support and loan access matter to the behaviour and performances of companies during the pandemic. We use a microdata set from a worldwide survey of more than 15,729 companies conducted between April and September 2020 by the World Bank. Logistic regression is used to assess which factors increase the likelihood of businesses suffering due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our results show that COVID-19 negatively impacts the performance of companies in almost all countries analysed, but a stronger effect is observed among firms from developing countries. The pandemic is more harmful to firms providing services than those representing the manufacturing sector. Due to the pandemic, firms suffer mainly in sales and liquidity decrease rather than employment reduction. The increase in the number of temporary workers is an important factor that significantly reduces the probability of sales, exports or supply decline. The analysis results indicate policy tools supporting enterprises during the pandemic, such as increasing the flexibility of the labour market or directing aid to developing countries.","Olczyk, Magdalena Kuc-Czarnecka Marta Ewa",Energies,https://doi.org/10.3390/en14144155,135

While there is conservation concern for many long-distance migratory bird populations, the magnitude and geographic range of threats affecting birds along flyways are poorly known, which complicates efficient mitigation. We used an endangered soaring migrant, the Egyptian Vulture Neophron percnopterus, as an example species to assess important threats in 13 countries along the eastern Mediterranean flyway. We tracked 71 birds using satellite telemetry to quantify mortalities, surveyed 4198 km of powerlines to detect dead birds, conducted 910 interviews to quantify the prevalence of poison use, and assessed the magnitude of direct persecution by surveying markets and hunters. We lost 44 birds (50% in Europe and the Mediterranean Sea, 16% in the Middle East, and 34% in Africa), and mortality causes varied geographically. Inadvertent poisoning resulting from rural stakeholders targeting predators occurred along most of the flyway. On the breeding grounds in eastern Europe, poisoning and collision and electrocution continue to be major threats. Electrocution on small and poorly designed electricity pylons was most severe in Turkey, Ethiopia and Saudi Arabia, while direct persecution to meet market demands for belief-based use of vulture products appears to be the largest threat in Nigeria and Niger. Illegal direct persecution for leisure is a major threat in the Middle East and Egypt. Although our work cannot quantitatively estimate which of the identified threats has the greatest demographic impact on Egyptian Vultures, none of threats are species-specific and are therefore relevant for many other migratory birds. Our assessment highlights the key threats per country that range states need to address to meet their obligations under the Convention of Migratory Species to protect migratory birds.","Oppel, Steffen; Arkumarev, Volen; Bakari, Samuel; Dobrev, Vladimir; Saravia, Victoria; Adefolu, Solomon; Sözüer, Lale Aktay; Apeverga, Paul Tersoo; Arslan, Şafak; Barshep, Yahkat; Bino, Taulant; Bounas, Anastasios; Çetin, Turan; Dayyoub, Maher; Dobrev, Dobromir; Duro, Klea; El-Moghrabi, Laith; ElSafoury, Hana; Endris, Ahmed; Asswad, Nabegh Ghazal; Harry, Junior Hanson; Ivande, Sam T; Jbour, Sharif; Kapsalis, Eleftherios; Kret, Elzbieta; Mahamued, Bruktawit A; Manu, Shiiwua A; Mengistu, Solomon; Moussa Zabeirou, Abdoul Razack; Muhammad, Sulaiman Inuwa; Nakev, Slave; Ngari, Alex; Onoja, Joseph; Osta, Maher; Özuslu, Serdar; Petrovski, Nenad; Popgeorgiev, Georgi; Pourchier, Cloé; Ruffo, Alazar; Shobrak, Mohammed; Sidiropoulos, Lavrentis; Skartsi, Theodora; Sözüer, Özgün; Stara, Kalliopi; Tesfaye, Million; Topi, Mirjan; Vavylis, Dimitrios; Velevski, Metodija; Vorpsi, Zydjon; Wondafrash, Mengistu; Xeka, Erald; Yeniyurt, Can; Yordanov, Emil; Nikolov, Stoyan C",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.16.422983,135
184729,Mouse hepatitis virus strain A59 is released from opposite sides of different epithelial cell types.,1997,"Purpose: The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic led education institutions to move all face-to-face (F2F) courses online. The situation is unique in that teachers and students can make a direct comparison of their courses before (F2F) and after COVID-19 (online). This study aims to analyze teachers’ viewpoints for this unprecedented change. Design/methodology/approach: The study followed a mixed-method approach within an ex post facto survey research design. Research tools were distributed among 200 Indian secondary school teachers following a heterogeneous purposive sampling technique. As the study was conducted during the pandemic backdrop researchers used Google forms and telephonic interviews to collect data. Findings: Teachers viewed positively to this shift from F2F to online teaching-learning (OTL). They were found to have an overall moderate level of online teaching efficacy and where good efficacy prevails there found minimal concern for infrastructure, an attitude showing least concern for “what is not” and more concerned with “what they can do with what is having.” A statistically significant effect of teacher efficacy was found on their perception of OTL infrastructure that supports this strong conviction among few teachers. Statistical analysis revealed for every 1 standard unit increase in self-efficacy, the perceived OTL infrastructure was to be increased by 0.997 standard units which support the strong correlation between the two chosen cognitive variables (r = 0.8). Besides, teachers were not found as a homogeneous group concerning their reported readiness for online teaching yet, different subgroups of teachers exist which may require different approaches for support and counseling. Originality/value: The paper reports an original empirical survey conducted in India and the write-up is based strictly on the survey findings only.

Using a model for 21 countries including ASEAN+3, developing East Asia and South Asia, as well as Australia and New Zealand to explain the difference in actual 2019 and forecasted 2020 GDP growth, we find that, ceteris paribus, stronger national capacities to detect and respond to emerging outbreaks (in particular, laboratory capacity) are associated with better shor t term economic outcomes. For the Philippines, up to 3.6 percentage points in lost GDP growth forecasted in 2020 could have been saved. Our results suggest that a dear th in health system capacity should be prioritized over and above any other type of spending, including traditional stimulus (e.g., large-scale infrastructure) spending. Our results also underscore the need to rethink what is necessary for the stability and resilience of an economy—what are the “economic fundamentals”—in an era of global physical shocks, including those brought about by climate hazards.

(2018). Firstly, we refined the evaluation of the impact of OVX changes on stock returns by introducing nonparametric function setting, a technique robust to parametric form assumptions of Xiao et al. (2018). Secondly, we extend the original data sets from May 10, 2007, to April 9, 2020, to assess the consistency of the estimated results. Thirdly, we apply the most recent econometric model, the semiparametric additive quantile regression proposed by Fasiolo et al. (2020), instead of the linear quantile regression used in Xiao et al. (2018) to explore the potential nonlinear relationships between OVX shocks and stock returns from the asymmetric and heterogeneous perspectives. Fourthly, we investigate whether the COVID-19 pandemic mediated the OVX–stock connection, because this pandemic has had a tremendous impact on global financial markets. Our results reveal that the implications of OVX shocks on stock returns are nonlinear and dynamic and exhibit high asymmetry and heterogeneity. In particular, the positive OVX changes have a “U-shaped” effect on Chinese stock rewards in a bearish market, rather than the linear negative effect reported by Xiao et al. (2018). Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic amplified the consequences of the positive and negative OVX variations on Chinese stock returns.","Xie, Qichang Wu Haifeng Ma Yu",Energy Economics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eneco.2021.105495,135

While it will take several years of study and research to understand the true effect of this pandemic on society, it is worthy of noting that it has already transformed our methods of leading lives. One of the areas, highly impacted by a pandemic is education. In order to deliver education in a distance learning manner, more and more academic institutions have been acquiring IT systems to deliver education to the students in the confines and safety of their homes. Saudi Electronic University (SEU) has been pioneering the application of online systems for blended learning in not just Saudi Arabia but the whole middle east and north Africa region. The reliance on systems at SEU for maintaining education standards during pandemics has increased. This has provided the opportunity to researchers in various fields of IT and computing to study evolving role of such systems in traditional and blended models of education. Situational Factors (SFs) are key elements that affect the acceptability of systems by stakeholders. This paper describes the outcome of the study that was carried out to identify critical Situational Factors that play a major role in the acceptance or otherwise of systems in the academic sphere during pandemic times. The results have shown that knowledge, communication, and trust are the most important situational factors for blended learning applications.

The objectives of our study was to phenotype individuals at highest risk of mental health disorders among COVID-19 outpatients. Methods: We conducted a binational online survey study with adult non-hospitalized COVID-19 convalescents (Austria/AT: n=1157, Italy/IT: n= 893). Primary endpoints were positive screening for depression and anxiety (PHQ-4, Patient Health Questionnaire) and self-perceived overall mental health and quality of life rated with 4 point Likert scales. Psychosocial stress was surveyed with a modified PHQ stress module. Associations of the mental health with socio-demographic variables, COVID-19 course and recovery data were assessed by multi-parameter random forest and serial univariable modeling. Mental disorder risk subsets were defined by self-organizing map and hierarchical clustering algorithms. The survey analyses are publicly available (https://im2-ibk.shinyapps.io/mental_health_dashboard/). Results: In the study cohorts, 4.6 (IT)/6% (AT) of participants reported depression and/or anxiety before to infection. At a median of 79 days (AT)/96 days (IT) post COVID-19 onset, 12.4 (AT)/19.3% (IT) of subjects were screened positive for anxiety and 17.3 (AT)/23.2% (IT) for depression. Over one-fifth of the respondents rated their overall mental health (AT: 21.8%, IT: 24.1%) or quality of life (AT: 20.3%, IT: 25.9%) as fair or poor. In both study collectives, psychosocial stress, high numbers of acute and persistent COVID-19 complaints and the presence of acute neurocognitive symptoms (impaired concentration, confusion, forgetfulness) were the strongest correlates of deteriorating mental health and poor quality of life. In clustering analysis, these variables defined a high risk subset with particularly high propensity of post-COVID-19 mental health impairment and decreased quality of life. Pre-existing depression or anxiety was associated with an increased symptom burden during acute COVID-19 and recovery. Conclusion: Our study revealed a bidirectional relationship between COVID-19 symptoms and mental health. We put forward specific acute symptoms of the disease as red flags of mental health deterioration which should prompt general practitioners to identify COVID-19 patients who may benefit from early psychological and psychiatric intervention.

As part of a World Bank project, we estimated excess mortality in Ukraine during 2020. Data on all deaths registered in government-controlled Ukraine from 2016-2020 (N=2,946,505) were utilized. We predicted deaths in 2020 by five-year age groups, sex, and month and calculated the number of deaths that deviated from expected levels (excess deaths). We compared excess deaths with the number of recorded COVID-19 deaths on death certificates and with published estimates for 30 European countries. We estimated 38,095 excess deaths in 2020 (6% of all deaths). Death rates were above expected levels in February and from June-December and lower in January and March-May. From June-December, we estimated 52,124 excess deaths with a peak in November (16,891 deaths). COVID-19 recorded deaths were approximately one-third of excess deaths in June-December (18,959 vs. 52,124). Higher than expected mortality was detected for all age groups 40-44 years and above and for those ages 0-4, 15-19, and 20-24. Ukrainian excess mortality was about average compared to 30 other European countries. Excess deaths may be attributed directly to SARS-COV2 infection or indirectly to death causes associated with social and economic upheavals resulting in from the pandemic. Lower than expected mortality during the early part of 2020 is consistent with low influenza activity and reductions in deaths from restricted movement. Further studies are required to examine the causes of death that have contributed to positive excess mortality, particularly among younger aged groups.","Mehta, N.; Honchar, I.; Doroshenko, O.; Brovenchko, I.; Pak, K.; Danyuk, M.; Polikarchuk, P.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.09.28.21264266v1?rss=1,135

Van Dijk started to develop her own practice and methodology in the late 1990s, and she applies this method to her own choreographies and teaches it to professional dancers and dance students worldwide. A psycho-physical approach to performer training informed by the Alexander Technique and William Forsythe’s space analysis, Countertechnique had a profound impact on twenty-six third-year dance students in 2020 at the Victorian College of the Arts (VCA), University of Melbourne. Following an intensive semester of classes and workshops with van Dijk and Countertechnique teachers, students reported an enhanced capacity to experiment, the enjoyment of full-bodied dancing, increased stamina, lower levels of pain and injury, and a deeper spatial awareness. In this interview with Carol Brown (Head of Dance, VCA), van Dijk discusses Countertechnique in relation to its founding principles, the local and global context, and specific dance tools that support performing artists to sustain long careers.

These resources are being impacted severely by rapid population growth (> 2% yr-1, with expected doubling by 2035) and widespread poverty, coupled with increasing international market demand and rapid technological changes, compounded by inefficiencies in governance and a lack of awareness and/or acceptance of some laws among local populations, particularly in parts of the Philippines and Indonesia. These key root causes all contribute to illegal practices and corruption, and are resulting in severe resource depletion and degradation of water catchments, river, lacustrine, estuarine, coastal, and marine ecosystems.

187014,Isolation of avian infectious bronchitis coronavirus from domestic peafowl (Pavo cristatus) and teal (Anas).,2005,"PROBLEM Preterm, premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) is a dire pregnancy outcome that is frequently associated with infection by the genital mycoplasmas, Mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma parvum, and U. urealyticum. One potential mechanism by which these microorganisms may cause PPROM is by increasing the concentration of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in the membranes and amniotic fluid. We tested this hypothesis in a well-defined model system of genital infection with M. pulmonis, a natural reproductive pathogen of rats. METHOD OF STUDY Timed-pregnant, specific pathogen-free, Sprague-Dawley rats were infected with 10(7) CFU M. pulmonis at gestation day (gd) 14. Controls received an equivalent volume (100 microL) of sterile medium. At gd 18, rats were euthanized, and membranes and amniotic fluids were harvested and stored at -70 degrees C until analysis. Proteinase activity of amniotic fluid and membranes was resolved on discontinuous 7.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gelatin zymography gels. Band intensity was determined using a digital gel documentation system and the manufacturer's software (Kodak). RESULTS Gelatinolytic activity associated with a band similar in molecular weight to ProMMP-9 (92 kDa, the inactive precursor of MMP-9) was significantly increased in amniotic fluids and membranes harvested from M. pulmonis-treated pups at gd 18 when compared with tissues harvested from control pups. Both ProMMP-9 and ProMMP-2 (72 kDa, the inactive precursor of MMP-2) were increased in infected animals at gd 21. CONCLUSION Our study suggests that the genital mycoplasmas can increase MMP-9 production in vivo.","Peltier, Morgan R; Barney, Brandon M; Brown, Mary B",American journal of reproductive immunology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17217365/,135

Ten mature, female, white-tailed deer were inoculated by intratonsilar instillation of 2 x 10(3)or 2 x 10(5)colony-forming units of M. bovis. Lymphocyte proliferation and humoral response to M. bovis PPD and the M. bovis protein, MPB70 were measured. Deer were tested for exposure to M. bovis by the comparative cervical skin test. Biopsy specimens of skin test sites were examined microscopically and immunohistochemically. The comparative cervical skin test correctly identified all M. bovis -inoculated deer as exposed to M. bovis. Lymphocyte proliferative responses to MPB70 were more consistent than responses to M. bovisPPD in M. bovis -inoculated deer. Antibody responses were more prominent in deer with disseminated disease than in deer with localised disease. The cellular components of delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions at skin test sites were similar to tuberculin reactions in other species. T lymphocytes of the gamma/delta phenotype were seen in increased numbers in M. bovisPPD injection sites.","Palmer, M V; Whipple, D L; Olsen, S C; Jacobson, R H",Research in veterinary science,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10684765/,135

In addition, highly attenuated and, therefore, very safe RV-based vectors have been constructed. Here, an RV-based vaccine vehicle was utilized as a novel vaccine against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). For this approach, the SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein (N) or envelope spike protein (S) genes were cloned between the RV glycoprotein G and polymerase L genes. Recombinant vectors expressing SARS-CoV N or S protein were recovered and their immunogenicity was studied in mice. A single inoculation with the RV-based vaccine expressing SARS-CoV S protein induced a strong SARS-CoV-neutralizing antibody response. The ability of the RV-SARS-CoV S vector to confer immunity after a single inoculation makes this live vaccine a promising candidate for eradication of SARS-CoV in animal reservoirs, thereby reducing the risk of transmitting the infection to humans.","Faber, Milosz; Lamirande, Elaine W; Roberts, Anjeanette; Rice, Amy B; Koprowski, Hilary; Dietzschold, Bernhard; Schnell, Matthias J",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15831955/,135

METHODS Two hundred thirty patients with gastric adenocarcinoma admitted t o the Department of Abdominal Surgery at Hospital do Câncer A. C. Camargo (São Paulo) and treated by gastrectomy from January 1992 until December 1996 were included in this retrospective cohort. The prognostic score was created according to the variables identified in the multivariate analysis and by using the regression coefficients generated by the Cox regression. RESULTS The 5-year overall survival rate was 44.5%. The final multivariate model identified six variables with a significant and independent effect on survival: sex, weight loss, lymphocyte count, tumor-node-metastasis staging, lymphadenectomy, and lymph node ratio. Patients were divided into four groups according to their scores, as follows: group 1, 0 to 3.0; group 2, 3.5 to 5.5; group 3, 6.0 to 8.5; and group 4, 9.0 to 14.0. The 5-year survival rates were 91.5%, 49.3%, 20.3%, and .0% for the score groups 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively (P<.001). The score was superior in the assessment of prognosis when compared with tumor-node-metastasis staging alone. CONCLUSIONS It is possible to create a prognostic score that simultaneously includes factors related to the tumor, patient, and treatment, thus generating a more effective system in predicting the prognosis than the morphology-based staging systems.","Costa, Marcelo Leite Vieira; de Cássia Braga Ribeiro, Karina; Machado, Marcel Autran César; Costa, Ana Carolina Leite Vieira; Montagnini, André Luis",Annals of surgical oncology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16614885/,135

METHODS A total of 80 clinically diagnosed SARS patients was enrolled in this study. RESULTS The result showed that 72/80 patients had exposed to SARS patient, and the least contact time was only 20 minutes, the average incubation period was (7.6 +/- 4.3) days (range 2 to 20 days); 53 (66.3%) subjects were hospital stuffs in this group, and 92.5% hospital stuffs (49/53) and 85.2% non-hospital stuffs (23/27) had the history of direct contact with SARS patients, respectively. The incubation period for the hospital stuffs and non-hospital stuffs were similar. More nurses (54.7%) were infected than doctors (34%) and nurse assistance (11.3%). The lack of isolation and self-protection was the most important factor for the hospital infection, and early isolation could efficiently prevent the spread of the disease. CONCLUSION Close exposure was the most important way for the transmission of SARS and the aggregation of the disease is common. The incubation period was around 7 days. The efficient isolation and self-protection could reduce the infection and prevent the spread of the disease.","Lu, Haiying; Huo, Na; Xu, Xiaoyuan; Wang, Guangfa; Li, Jianping; Wang, Guiqiang; Li, Haichao; Wang, Jun; Nie, Ligong",Beijing da xue xue bao.

Dermatology is particularly suited for this virtual modality. The COVID-19 pandemic significantly increased the use of telemedicine worldwide which has demonstrated to be useful in promoting social distancing and in avoiding the overload of the healthcare system. This is an observational study about the use of teledermatology during the pandemic in the area of connective tissue diseases in a public hospital in Buenos Aires City. The main objective was to assess if teledermatology is useful to resolve patient's consultation and thus to avoid the referral to the hospital. There were 120 teledermatological consultations included, from which 93.3% were made by women. The average age was 38.4 years. The 57.5% of the consultations were from patients of the outskirts of Buenos Aires and 33.3% from Buenos Aires City. The 47.5% of consultations were from patients with no medical insurance. Of the total, 17 (14.2%) required referral to a health center. Most of the consultations were follow-up's and in a lower percentage, due to reactivation of the underlying disease or another reason. Patients who completed the survey reported not having difficulties and were able to resolve their consultations through virtual care. Doctors involved in this study were totally satisfied with the experience and they felt that teledermatology was a valid resource to continue with their medical training and would choose to use it in the near future.","Debernardi, María Emilia; Bordón, María Paz; Campastri, Ana; Chequim, Agustina; Cilio, Antonella M; Fava, María Victoria; Kuperman Wilder, Lola; Bendjuia, Gabriela",Medicina,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33481728/,135

Several viruses and bacteria can cause acute pharyngitis; however, Streptococcus pyogenes (also known as Lancefield group A β-hemolytic streptococci) is the only agent that requires an etiologic diagnosis and specific treatment. S. pyogenes is of major clinical importance because it can trigger post-infection systemic complications, acute rheumatic fever, and post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis. Symptom onset in streptococcal infection is usually abrupt and includes intense sore throat, fever, chills, malaise, headache, tender enlarged anterior cervical lymph nodes, and pharyngeal or tonsillar exudate. Cough, coryza, conjunctivitis, and diarrhea are uncommon, and their presence suggests a viral cause. A diagnosis of pharyngitis is supported by the patient's history and by the physical examination. Throat culture is the gold standard for diagnosing streptococcus pharyngitis. However, it has been underused in public health services because of its low availability and because of the 1- to 2-day delay in obtaining results. Rapid antigen detection tests have been used to detect S. pyogenes directly from throat swabs within minutes. Clinical scoring systems have been developed to predict the risk of S. pyogenes infection. The most commonly used scoring system is the modified Centor score. Acute S. pyogenes pharyngitis is often a self-limiting disease. Penicillins are the first-choice treatment. For patients with penicillin allergy, cephalosporins can be an acceptable alternative, although primary hypersensitivity to cephalosporins can occur. Another drug option is the macrolides. Future perspectives to prevent streptococcal pharyngitis and post-infection systemic complications include the development of an anti-Streptococcus pyogenes vaccine.","Anjos, Lais Martins Moreira; Marcondes, Mariana Barros; Lima, Mariana Ferreira; Mondelli, Alessandro Lia; Okoshi, Marina Politi",Revista da Sociedade Brasileira de Medicina Tropical,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25229278/,135

METHODS Data on clinically-diagnosed SARS cases reported to Shanxi Center for Disease Control and Prevention through SARS reporting system of Shanxi province and epidemiological reports were collected from early March to 20 May, 2003. The characteristics of SARS distribution in time, place and population in Shanxi were described. The epidemiological characteristics and related influential factors were analyzed with EPI info 6.0 software. RESULTS Since the first imported SARS case was diagnosed clinically on 7 March and till 20 May in Shanxi province, the number of cumulative clinically-diagnosed SARS cases were 445 with an attack rate of 1.34/10,000. 20 deaths occurred in that period with the mortality rate 4.49%. The number of cases increased from 28 March and formed the first peak. However, the number continued to increase until 18 April to have formed the second peak. Since then, the number of cases has gradually decreased gradually. Since 19 May, there has been no clinically-diagnosed cases being reported. SARS cases were mostly seen in urban areas of the city (83.82% of the total SARS cases) with sporadic cases found in rural areas. Students and medical staff and people from 20 - 59 years of age occupied the large part of the cases. Age specific mortality rate increased with age and the male/female ratio was 1:0.87. CONCLUSION In Shanxi province, the SARS epidemic seemed to have had the following stages: importation of the first case, gradual increase of the number of cases to reach the peak and decreasing. Case identification at early stage as well as taking measures to decrease the chance of transmission were strategically crucial for controlling the spread of SARS virus in the community.","Mei, Zhi-qiang; Guan, Lian-xin; Chai, Zhi-kai; Duan, Fa-yu; Qu, Cheng-yi; Zhang, Jie-min; Zhai, Ru-fang; Wu, Li-ping; Chen, Tao-an; Zhao, Liang-huai; Li, Guo-hua; Sang, Zhi-hong",Zhonghua liu xing bing xue za zhi = Zhonghua liuxingbingxue zazhi,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12848908/,135

One hundred twenty sera collected from cats belonging to catteries or community shelters and to households were tested for FCoV type I and II antibodies. The virus neutralization (VN) was performed and compared with indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Ninety-six sera tested positive for FCoV antibodies by VN and ELISA. Interestingly, ELISA revealed 2 more positive sera than did the VN test and 3 more positive sera than did the IFAT. All results were confirmed by Western blotting. ELISA proved to be more sensitive and detected a seroprevalence of about 82%. Considering the cross-reactivity of FCoV type I and type II, ELISA was able to detect antibodies against both serotypes, allowing the use of the assay as a reference test for sera screening. The high prevalence of antibodies observed indicates that FCoVs are common in southern Italian cat populations.","Pratelli, Annamaria","Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18182507/,135

An important factor permitting the treatment of patients in a prioritized fashion was our pre-existing centralized OR booking (CORB) framework, which already required surgeons to categorize the priority level for each patient. The CORB, in conjunction with the multidisciplinary OR oversight committee that was formed during COVID-19 to review and triage the urgent cases, allowed for prioritization of cases among surgical services. Centralized OR booking provided opportunities that were essential in OR planning during the pandemic, including the ability to plan surgeries to maximize OR efficiency, minimize the number of admissions on any given day to the wards and the intensive care unit, flatten the number of admissions over the week and provide the flexibility to ramp up or down the number of ORs as the crisis changed.","Tanzer, Michael; Racaniello, Stella; Feldman, Liane",Canadian journal of surgery.

The microneutralizing test showed that one clone, designated M1A, had neutralizing activity on Vero E6 cells against SARS-CoV. DNA sequence analysis indicated that the light- and heavy-chain genes of M1A Fab belong to the kappa2a and 4f families, respectively. A neutralizing test on purified M1A demonstrated that 0.5 mg/ml of M1A completely inhibited SARS-CoV activity, with an absence of cytopathic effect for 7 days. Real-time fluorescence reverse transcription-PCR also proved the neutralizing capacity of M1A. These data showed that the number of virus copies was significantly reduced in the M1A-treated group, suggesting an important role for M1A in passive immunoprophylaxis against the SARS virus.","Kang, Xiaoping; Yang, Bao-An; Hu, Yuyang; Zhao, Hui; Xiong, Wei; Yang, Yinhui; Si, Bingyin; Zhu, Qingyu",Clinical and vaccine immunology : CVI,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16893997/,135

Along with CD4, HIV-1 requires a chemokine receptor, CCR5 or CXCR4, as an entry co-receptor, and differential co-receptor selectivity is an important determinant of viral diversity and pathogenesis. CCR5 and CXCR4 blockers have been the focus of much research and are now entering clinical trials. RECENT FINDINGS Several CCR5 antagonists with anti-HIV-1 activity have been developed, including small-molecule agents, monoclonal antibodies and modified chemokines. At least four small-molecule and one antibody CCR5 inhibitor are in various stages of preclinical and clinical testing. Most or all infected individuals harbor CCR5-using variants, and promising findings have been reported from very preliminary clinical studies. CXCR4 antagonists under development include small-molecule and short-peptide inhibitors. Only a subset of late-stage individuals harbor CXCR4-using strains, and early clinical studies of CXCR4 inhibition showed some evidence of suppression in certain individuals. SUMMARY Chemokine receptor antagonists offer great promise as a much-needed new class of antiviral agent. They also raise questions that are unique to agents targeting these cellular receptors, including whether drug resistance will lead to variants with altered co-receptor selectivity, the tolerability of chronically blocking receptors involved in inflammation (CCR5, CXCR4) or essential in development and hematopoesis (CXCR4), and the role of co-receptor phenotyping in selecting blocking agents. In addition to HIV-1 infection, these drugs may also have utility in inflammation, cancer, stem cell transplant and other areas.","Shaheen, Farida; Collman, Ronald G",Current opinion in infectious diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15090884/,135

Recently, more and more studies reported that the degree of liver damages was associated with the severity of COVID-19. Although the exact mechanism of liver injury in COVID-19 patients is unknown, recent studies have made some explorations and investigations. In this review, we summarized the potential mechanisms of liver dysfunction in COVID-19 patients gleaned from recently published research reports, which suggested that the progression of pre-existing liver diseases, direct damage of liver by SARS-CoV-2, systemic inflammation caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, anti-viral drug toxicity, and hypoxia-reperfusion may be associated with liver injury in patients with COVID-19. Hypoxic liver injury due to ischemia and shock, cholestasis-related liver injury due to altered bile metabolism, and hepatocellular injury due to drug toxicity or overwhelming inflammation might occur in severe COVID-19 patients with sepsis. To understand the pathogenesis of liver dysfunction in COVID-19 patients, further research is needed to focus on liver-related comorbidities, the evidence of viral replication in hepatocytes and bile duct cells, histological features of liver injury, and the influence of hepatotoxic antiviral drugs. We also suggested that special attention should be paid to monitoring inflammatory cytokines and hypoxia for the prevention and treatment of liver injury in severe COVID-19 patients. A deep understanding of the mechanism of liver injury is helpful for the management and treatment of COVID-19 patients.","Huang, Chenlu; Li, Qiang; Xu, Wei; Chen, Liang",Discovery medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33382966/,135

Understanding the mechanisms of action of synthetic small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) underlies use as therapeutic agents in the areas of cancer and viral infection. Recent studies have also promoted different theories about cell-specific targeting of siRNAs. Design and delivery strategies for successful treatment of human diseases are becomingmore established and relationships between miRNA and RNAi pathways have been revealed as virus-host cell interactions. Although both are well conserved in plants, invertebrates and mammals, there is also variabilityand a more complete understanding of differences will be needed for optimal application. RNA interference (RNAi) is rapid, cheap and selective in complex biological systems and has created new insight sin fields of cancer research, genetic disorders, virology and drug design. Our knowledge about the role of miRNAs and siRNAs pathways in virus-host cell interactions in virus infected cells is incomplete. There are different viral diseases but few antiviral drugs are available. For example, acyclovir for herpes viruses, alpha-interferon for hepatitis C and B viruses and anti-retroviral for HIV are accessible. Also cancer is obviously an important target for siRNA-based therapies, but the main problem in cancer therapy is targeting metastatic cells which spread from the original tumor. There are also other possible reservations and problems that might delay or even hinder siRNA-based therapies for the treatment of certain conditions; however, this remains the most promising approach for a wide range of diseases. Clearly, more studies must be done to allow efficient delivery and better understanding of unwanted side effects of siRNA-based therapies. In this review miRNA and RNAi biology, experimental design, anti-viral and anti-cancer effects are discussed.","Mollaie, Hamid Reza; Monavari, Seyed Hamid Reza; Arabzadeh, Seyed Ali Mohammad; Shamsi-Shahrabadi, Mahmoud; Fazlalipour, Mehdi; Afshar, Reza Malekpour",Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24460249/,135

Only a weak relationship between BCV positivity (2 or more positive samples, p < 0.05) and cattle contact was demonstrated in this study. Possible transmission routes and other factors that could have affected the result are discussed. In light of our finding that all 5 sheep experimentally exposed to BCV through contact with infectious cow faeces seroconverted, we conclude that the antibodies found in Swedish sheep are probably the result of BCV infections directly or indirectly transmitted from cattle.","Tråvén, M; Carlsson, U; Lundén, A; Larsson, B",Acta veterinaria Scandinavica,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10418197/,135

This led to de novo synthesis of the three major structural proteins of the virus--the G, N, and M proteins--as shown by immunoprecipitation of [35S]methionine-labeled spheroplast lysates. In NaDodSO4/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, M and N proteins comigrated with those of the virion, whereas the yeast-made G protein migrated as two bands with apparent molecular sizes of 60 and 70 kDa. Both polypeptides appeared to be N-glycosylated, since only one polypeptide with the apparent molecular mass of approximately equal to 55 kDa was produced in the presence of tunicamycin. Phase separation into Triton X-114 suggested that the unglycosylated G protein was membrane bound. According to immunofluorescent surface staining of live spheroplasts, at least part of the G protein was transported to the plasma membrane. Spheroplasts expressing the VSV genes could be fused together by low pH to form polykaryons, indicating that G protein synthetized by yeast was fusogenic--i.e., biologically active.","Makarow, M; Nevalainen, L T; Kääriäinen, L",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3022281/,135

MATERIALS AND METHODS Bibliometric analysis of original articles published until September 8, 2020, in journals indexed in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, LILACS, and SciELO. Bibliometric indicators were obtained. Likewise, analysis of the co-citation of authors and co-occurrence of terms with the terms included in the title and the abstract of publications was performed. RESULTS Data from 180 original articles were analyzed. An increase in the number of articles on H. pylori was found (R2 = 0.64, an average annual growth rate of 8.01%). A total of 777 authors were identified, with an average number of articles per author of 0.18, and a collaboration index of 5.64. The average number of citations per original article was 1.91. The Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia was the institution with the highest number of original articles (63.2%). The analysis of co-occurrence of terms found terms related to gastric cancer during the whole study period and, for recent years, terms related to the treatment of H. pylori infection and water sources. CONCLUSION There is an increase in Peruvian production in original articles on H. pylori. In recent years, the study of the eradication of H. pylori and the transmission of the agent from water sources have been topics of interest.","Hernández-Vásquez, Akram; Bautista-Pariona, Anthony; Bendezu-Quispe, Guido",Revista de gastroenterologia del Peru : organo oficial de la Sociedad de Gastroenterologia del Peru,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34087922/,135

Regarding the set of infected nodes as constituting a dynamic network that evolves continuously in time, we ask: how does the order in the collective dynamics of the network vary with time? Utilizing synchronizability as a measure of the order, we find that there exists a time at which a maximum amount of disorder corresponding to a minimum degree of synchronizability can arise before the system settles into a more ordered steady state. This phenomenon of transient disorder occurs for networks of both regular and complex topologies. We present physical analyses and numerical support to establish the generality of the phenomenon.","Yang, Rui; Huang, Liang; Lai, Ying-Cheng","Physical review.

Since 1989, overall influenza vaccination coverage among HCP has never exceeded 49% in any season, according to estimates from the National Health Interview Survey. In August 2009, ACIP recommended that HCP be one of five initial target groups to receive the influenza A (H1N1) 2009 monovalent vaccine when it first became available. This report summarizes results of a population-based panel survey administered via the Internet during January 2010 to a nationally representative sample of 1,417 HCP to assess vaccination coverage. By mid-January 2010, estimated vaccination coverage among HCP was 37.1% for 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) and 61.9% for seasonal influenza. Overall, 64.3% received either of these influenza vaccines, higher coverage than any previous season, but only 34.7% of HCP reported receiving both vaccines. The existence of an employer requirement for vaccination at the facility where the respondent was employed was associated with an eightfold greater likelihood of 2009 H1N1 vaccination compared with respondents employed by facilities with neither requirement nor recommendations; likewise, the existence of a recommendation for vaccination was associated with a fourfold greater probability of 2009 H1N1 vaccination.

194884,The spike protein of infectious bronchitis virus is retained intracellularly by a tyrosine motif.,2008,"Progesterone and cholesterol are both vital to pregnancy. Among other functions, progesterone downregulates inflammatory responses, allowing for maternal immune tolerance of the fetal allograft. Cholesterol a key component of cell membranes, is important in intracellular transport, cell signaling, nerve conduction, and metabolism Despite the importance of each substance in pregnancy, one exercises an antagonistic effect on the other, as periods of peak progesterone correspond with reductions in cholesterol availability, a consequence of progesterone's negative effects on cholesterol biosynthesis. This arrangement is understandable in light of the threat posed by pathogens early in pregnancy. Progesterone-induced immunomodulation entails increased vulnerability to infection, an acute problem in the first trimester, when fetal development is highly susceptible to insult. Many pathogens rely on cholesterol for cell entry, egress, and replication. Progesterone's antagonistic effects on cholesterol thus partially compensate for the costs entailed by progesterone-induced immunomodulation. Among pathogens to which the host's vulnerability is increased by progesterone's effects, approximately 90% utilize cholesterol, and this is notably true of pathogens that pose a risk during pregnancy. In addition to having a number of possible clinical applications, our approach highlights the potential importance of second-order adaptations, themselves a consequence of the lack of teleology in evolutionary processes.","Amir, Dorsa; Fessler, Daniel M T",The Quarterly review of biology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23909226/,135

In an effort to better understand the mechanisms involved in protection from coronavirus infection, we are studying the role of the idiotypic network in the modulation of viral infectivity. We have explored the feasibility of using single-chain antibodies displayed on phage surfaces for the isolation of recombinant anti-idiotypic antibodies (anti-Ids) with antigen-mimicking properties, which has proven to be difficult with conventional hybridoma approaches. A phage-display library containing more than 10(8) different antibody specificities was screened for the presence of anti-Ids by successive rounds of panning with three different in vitro neutralizing and in vivo protective antiviral monoclonal antibodies. After five rounds of panning, between 32% and 84% of all individual clones tested showed antibody-binding in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Although several clones showed identical antibody sequences, a number of different clones were identified and further characterized. None of the selected clones induced the production of antiviral or neutralizing antibodies or conferred reproducible protection from viral challenge in BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice. These results demonstrate that anti-Ids can be isolated from a phage-display library, although high-affinity antigen-mimicking phages with antiviral protective capacities were apparently not represented in this library. This argues for the development of more diverse phage-display libraries.","Lamarre, A; Talbot, P J",Viral immunology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9473148/,135

The purpose of this document is to provide a general framework to assess the performance of FFRs that are only being used as a crisis capacity strategy. The intended audience are those who are responsible for managing large amounts of FFRs. This framework includes a four-step process consisting of: 1) defining the population of FFRs to be sampled; 2) providing sampling strategy options; 3) inspecting and testing the sampled units; and 4) evaluating the results.

The mechanism of translation initiation on hepacivirus/pestivirus (HP) IRESs, which involves factor-independent binding to ribosomal 40S subunits, also differs fundamentally from initiation on these picornavirus IRESs. Ribosomal binding to HP IRESs requires conserved sequences that form a pseudoknot and the adjacent IIId and IIIe domains; analogous elements do not occur in the two principal groups of picornavirus IRESs. Here, comparative sequence analysis was used to identify a subset of picornaviruses from multiple genera that contain 5' UTR sequences with significant similarities to HP IRESs. They are avian encephalomyelitis virus, duck hepatitis virus 1, duck picornavirus, porcine teschovirus, porcine enterovirus 8, Seneca Valley virus, and simian picornavirus. Their 5' UTRs are predicted to form several structures, in some of which the peripheral elements differ from the corresponding HP IRES elements but in which the core pseudoknot, domain IIId, and domain IIIe elements are all closely related. These findings suggest that HP-like IRESs have been exchanged between unrelated virus families by recombination and support the hypothesis that RNA viruses consist of modular coding and noncoding elements that can exchange and evolve independently.","Hellen, Christopher U T; de Breyne, Sylvain",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17392358/,135

METHODS Data of SARS cases notified from Dongcheng District Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and supplemented by other channels were collected. All data were input into dataset files by Microsoft Excel-2000 software and analyzed with SPSS version 10.0 software. RESULTS Totally, 572 cases notified were collected during this period in Dongcheng District, Beijing, and 99 of them were excluded from SARS, because of diagnosis of common cold, pneumonia, measles, or rubella, etc. Actually, 473 SARS cases were analyzed. Attack rate of SARS in permanent residents of Dongcheng was 28.3 per 100,000. Forty-one of them died, with a case-fatality ratio of 8.7%. Outbreak of SARS in Dongcheng District started on March 14, with a peak during mid- and late April, and dropped from May 5, 2003. Persons were all susceptible to SARS, with the highest proportion at ages of 20-50 years, which accounted for 68.7% of the total cases. Average age of the patients at their onset was 40.7 years. No gender difference in SARS cases was found. Number of SARS cases in health care workers (HCWs) accounted for 18.0% and that in the retired persons accounted for 15.4% of the total cases. Cases occurred in all 10 sub-districts of Dongcheng. Totally, 230 of the 572 notified cases (40.2%) hospitalized at local hospitals under the jurisdiction of Dongcheng District. Eighteen of 85 cases of SARS occurred in health care workers of local hospitals, accounting for 4.5% of the total number of health care workers working at the wards caring for SARS patients or at fever clinics. There were 34.7% of SARS cases without any contact histories before their onset. Familial aggregation phenomena were observed in 41.8% of the cases and 18.1% of households. And, 7.4% (attack rate) in those exposed to SARS cases suffered the illness during the periods of quarantine. CONCLUSIONS SARS appeared outbreak in Dongcheng District, Beijing during March to June 2003. People were all susceptible to SARS, which mainly threatened the young adults and the middle-aged, as well as health care workers and the retired workers. Main mode of transmission was exposure to SARS patients in a near distance at hospitals or families. Prevention and control of SARS should be focused on early isolation of patients and quarantine for the contacts. Current available measures to prevent and control SARS proved effective.","Wang, Wei; Huang, Yong; Zhou, Wan-xin; Qiao, Lei; Huang, Jian-hui; Hu, Xin-ai; Yu, Zhen; Liu, Qing-hua; Wu, Zheng-lai",Zhongguo yi xue ke xue yuan xue bao.

In this report, we describe the biosynthesis of the human coronavirus 229E 3C-like proteinase in Escherichia coli and the enzymatic properties, inhibitor profile, and substrate specificity of the purified protein. Furthermore, we have introduced single amino acid substitutions and carboxyl-terminal deletions into the recombinant protein and determined the ability of these mutant 3C-like proteinases to catalyze the cleavage of a peptide substrate. Using this approach, we have identified the residues Cys-3109 and His-3006 as being indispensable for catalytic activity. Our results also support the involvement of His-3127 in substrate recognition, and they confirm the requirement of the carboxyl-terminal extension found in coronavirus 3C-like proteinases for enzymatic activity. These data provide experimental evidence for the relationship of coronavirus 3C-like proteinases to other viral chymotrypsin-like enzymes, but they also show that the coronavirus proteinase has additional, unique properties.","Ziebuhr, J; Heusipp, G; Siddell, S G",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9094676/,135

Sequencing analysis revealed the selection of a single adaptive mutation in the HCV E2 envelope protein that was largely responsible for the variant phenotype. In parallel, as the virus became more aggressive, cells that were resistant to infection emerged, displaying escape mechanisms operative at the level of viral entry, HCV RNA replication, or both. Collectively, these results reveal the existence of coevolutionary events during persistent HCV infection that favor survival of both virus and host.","Zhong, Jin; Gastaminza, Pablo; Chung, Josan; Stamataki, Zania; Isogawa, Masanori; Cheng, Guofeng; McKeating, Jane A; Chisari, Francis V",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16956932/,135
198851,Cross-reactive antibody responses to nsp1 and nsp2 of Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus.,2007,"BACKGROUND The 2003 global outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) provided numerous challenges to the delivery of critical care. The Toronto critical care community has learned important lessons from SARS, which will help in preparation for future disease outbreaks. OBJECTIVES The objectives of this study were to review the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of the Toronto SARS outbreak, the challenges SARS provided to the delivery of critical care, and how we would like to be better organized for a similar challenge in the future. FINDINGS SARS manifests clinically as atypical pneumonia and ranges in severity from minor nonspecific symptoms to adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Approximately 20% of patients with SARS will become critically ill and require admission to the intensive care unit. ARDS develops in the majority of these patients. Mortality from ARDS in SARS is high, and outcome is associated with the presence of comorbid disease and the severity of illness at presentation. The influx of critically ill patients and the transmission of SARS to front line workers created a tremendous strain on Toronto's healthcare system. From a critical care perspective, the most important limitation in the response to SARS was the absence of a coordinated leadership and communication infrastructure. Other challenges encountered during SARS include the following: closure of intensive care unit beds and loss of staff through quarantine and illness, implementing novel infection control protocols, educating staff, conducting research to learn about SARS, system planning, and maintaining staff morale during this very difficult period. CONCLUSIONS Communication and leadership strategies were key components in the critical care response to SARS. Ideally, centers should have systems in place to allow for the rapid expansion and modification of critical care services in the event of a disease outbreak. Other critical care communities should consider their crisis response strategies in advance of similar events.","Booth, Christopher M; Stewart, Thomas E",Critical care medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15640680/,135

237952,Formulating the Electrolyte Towards High-Energy and Safe Rechargeable Lithium-Metal Batteries,2021,"This article describes the semen characteristics from different collection methods between captive and confiscated Malayan pangolins, Manis javanica. Semen was collected from 15 pangolins; two captive and 13 confiscated individuals at the mean weight of 9.36 ± 1.94 kg. The three semen collection methods employed were electroejaculation, rectal massage and a combination of both techniques. The semen characteristics (mean ± standard deviation) of the Malayan pangolin are volume (73.75 ± 144.57 µL), pH (7.63 ± 0.53), spermatozoa concentration (997.19 ± 728.98 × 106 /mL), total motility (59.60% ± 30.00%), progressive motility (48.95% ± 30.93%), mass motility (3.50 ± 1.50) and live spermatozoa (80.25% ± 13.45%). There was no significant difference in semen characteristics between the three collection methods. The percentages of live spermatozoa were significantly different, suggesting better samples from captive compared to confiscated animals. However, there was no significant difference in spermatozoa kinetics between the captive and confiscated samples, suggesting the potential of utilizing confiscated individuals for gamete recovery to conserve the genetic pool of pangolins. All three methods of semen collection were successfully performed in pangolins and should be considered; however, electroejaculation remains the most consistent method of obtaining semen from the species.","Tarmizi, Reza; Keng Chee, Yap; Sipangkui, Symphorosa; Zainuddin, Zainal Zahari; Fitri, Wan-Nor",,,135

Historically, point-of-care tests have involved antigen detection technology with limited sensitivity. The aim of this study was to prospectively evaluate the diagnostic accuracy and model the economic impact of the Roche cobas® Liat® point-of-care influenza A/B and respiratory syncytial virus test. The ""DEC-RSV"" study was a multi-centre, prospective, observational study in children under 2 years presenting with viral respiratory symptoms. A nasopharyngeal aspirate sample was tested using the point-of-care test and standard laboratory-based procedures. The primary outcome was accuracy of respiratory syncytial virus detection. The cost implications of adopting a point-of-care test were modelled using study data. A total of 186 participants were recruited, with both tests performed on 177 samples. The point-of-care test was invalid for 16 samples (diagnostic yield 91%) leaving 161 available for primary analysis. After resolving discrepancies, the cobas® Liat® respiratory syncytial virus test had 100.00% (95% CI 96.07%-100.00%) sensitivity and 98.53% (95% CI 92.08%-99.96%) specificity. Median time to result was 0.6â h (interquartile range (IQR) 0.5-1) for point-of-care testing and 28.9â h (IQR 26.3-48.1) for standard laboratory testing. Estimated non-diagnostic cost savings for 1000 patients, based on isolation decision-making on point-of-care test result, were £57â010, which would increase to £94â847 when cohort nursing is used. In young children the cobas® Liat® point-of-care respiratory syncytial virus test has high diagnostic accuracy using nasopharyngeal aspirates (currently an off-licence sample type). Time to result is clinically important and was favourable compared to laboratory-based testing. The potential exists for cost savings when adopting the point-of-care test.","Allen, A Joy; Gonzalez-Ciscar, Andrea; Lendrem, Clare; Suklan, Jana; Allen, Karen; Bell, Ashley; Baxter, Frances; Crulley, Stephen; Fairlie, Louise; Hardy, Danielle; Johnston, Louise; McKenna, Joanne; Richards, Nicole; Shovlin, Gavin; Simmister, Clare; Waugh, Sheila; Woodsford, Philip; Graziadio, Sara; Power, Michael; Simpson, A John; Kumar, Prashant; Eastham, Katherine; Brodlie, Malcolm",ERJ open res,,135

We describe the measures implemented in the largest cancer centre in Singapore to continue optimal cancer care in spite of the ongoing pandemic, with no nosocomial infections reported in our centre to date. We adopted a multipronged approach, with an overall committee supervising the entire COVID-19 management effort. A screening clinic was setup to triage patients prior to entry to the centre. Each Oncology Division within the cancer centre designed solutions tailored to the specific needs of their discipline. We explore in detail the screening criteria and workflow of the screening clinic, as well as modifications by individual divisions to reduce infection risk to patients and healthcare professionals.

The model also takes into account partial confinement of individuals. This model is coupled with a model of protection against the epidemic by the use of masks. We are studying the effects of combined confinement and protection measures on the dynamics of the epidemic. We consider a constant proportion of asymptomatic people. We assume that symptomatic infected people may change their urban travel behavior due to the disease which causes them to travel less to places where they used to move and to stay at home more often. We present a sensitivity study with respect to the parameters. We show that the combination of the use of masks with almost complete release of confinement makes it possible to avoid the occurrence of a secondary peak of the epidemic. The model predicts that a total release of confinement can be successful for an epidemic of [Formula: see text] if on average a proportion of [Formula: see text] of the population wears masks of [Formula: see text] efficacy.

302575,Crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 nsp10 bound to nsp14-ExoN domain reveals an exoribonuclease with both structural and functional integrity,2021,"BACKGROUND: Contradictory results regarding changes in serum club cell protein 16 (CC16) levels in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) have been reported, challenging the value of CC16 as a diagnostic and prognostic marker for ARDS. We have also observed increased serum CC16 levels in patients with renal dysfunction (RD). Therefore, the present study aimed to determine whether RD affects the diagnostic performance of CC16 for ARDS in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. METHODS: We measured serum CC16 concentrations in 479 ICU patients, who were categorized into six groups according to their diagnoses: control, acute kidney injury (AKI), chronic kidney disease (CKD), ARDS, ARDS+AKI, and ARDS+CKD. The sensitivity, specificity, and cutoff values for serum CC16 were assessed by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. RESULTS: Serum CC16 concentrations were higher in the ARDS group than in the control group, and in ARDS patients with normal renal function, serum CC16 could identify ARDS and predict survival outcomes at 7 and 28 days. However, serum CC16 levels were similar among the ARDS+AKI, ARDS+CKD, AIK, and CKD groups. Consequently, in patients with AKI and/or CKD, the specificity of CC16 for diagnosing ARDS or ARDS+RD decreased from 86.62 to 2.82% or 81.70 to 2.12%, respectively. Consistently, the CC16 cutoff value of 11.57 ng/ml in patients with RD differed from the established values of 32.77-33.72 ng/ml with normal renal function. Moreover, the predictive value of CC16 for mortality in ARDS+RD patients was lost before 7 days but regained by 28 days. CONCLUSION: RD reduces the diagnostic specificity, diagnostic cutoff value, and predictive value for 7-day mortality of serum CC16 for ARDS among ICU patients.","Lin, Jinle; Tao, Wuyuan; Wei, Jian; Wu, Jian; Zhang, Wenwu; Ye, Jianbing; Fu, Xuan; Zeng, Shiyong; Dou, Qingli; Wang, Lijun; Tian, Fang",BMC Pulm Med,,135
302576,Crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 nsp10 bound to nsp14-ExoN domain reveals an exoribonuclease with both structural and functional integrity,2021,"PURPOSE: Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocols have been implemented across a variety of disciplines to improve outcomes. Herein we describe the impact of ERAS on quality of life (QOL) and cost for patients undergoing urologic oncology surgery. METHODS: A systematic literature search using the MEDLINE, Scopus, Clinictrials.gov, and Cochrane Review databases for studies published between 1946 and 2020 was conducted. Articles were reviewed and assigned a risk of bias by two authors and were included if they addressed ERAS and either QOL or cost-effectiveness for patients undergoing urologic oncology surgery. RESULTS: The literature search yielded a total of 682 studies after removing duplicates, of which 10 (1.5%) were included in the review. Nine articles addressed radical cystectomy, while one addressed ERAS and QOL for laparoscopic nephrectomy. Six publications assessed the impact of ERAS on QOL domains. Questionnaires used for assessment of QOL varied across studies, and timing of administration was heterogeneous. Overall, ERAS improved patient QOL during early phases of recovery within the realms of bowel function, physical/social/cognitive functioning, sleep and pain control. Costs were assessed in 4 retrospective studies including 3 conducted in the United States and one from China all addressing radical cystectomy. Studies demonstrated either decreased costs associated with ERAS as a result of decreased length of stay or no change in cost based on ERAS implementation. CONCLUSION: While limited studies are published on the subject, ERAS implementation for radical cystectomy and laparoscopic nephrectomy improved patient-reported QOL during early phases of recovery. For radical cystectomy, there was a decreased or neutral overall financial cost associated with ERAS. Further studies assessing QOL and cost-effectiveness over the entire global period of care in a variety of urologic oncology surgeries are warranted.","Brooks, Nathan A; Kokorovic, Andrea; McGrath, John S; Kassouf, Wassim; Collins, Justin W; Black, Peter C; Douglas, James; Djaladat, Hooman; Daneshmand, Siamak; Catto, James W F; Kamat, Ashish M; Williams, Stephen B",World j. urol,,135

The increasing global health and economic burden of SARS-CoV-2 has necessitated urgent investigations into the pathogenesis of disease and development of therapeutic and vaccination regimens. Human trials of vaccine and antiviral candidates have been undertaken, but basic pathogenetic studies are still required to inform these trials. Gaps in understanding of cellular infection by, and immunity to, SARS-CoV-2 mean additional models are required to assist in improved design of these therapeutics. Human organoids are three-dimensional models that contain multiple cell types and mimic human organs in ex vivo culture conditions. The SARS-CoV-2 virus has been implicated in causing not only respiratory injury but also injury to other organs such as the brain, liver and kidneys. Consequently, a variety of different organoid models have been employed to investigate the pathogenic mechanisms of disease due to SARS-CoV-2. Data on these models have not been systematically assembled. In this review, we highlight key findings from studies that have utilised different human organoid types to investigate the expression of SARS-CoV-2 receptors, permissiveness, immune response, dysregulation of cellular functions, and potential antiviral therapeutics.","Egilmezer, Ece; Rawlinson, William D",Rev. med. virol,,135

We analysed the demographic profile, history, functional assessment and all investigations of this study cohort. Out of the 2,165 patients provided consultation, there were 35 patients of post-COVID-19, which were included in the present study. These patients had a mean duration of 47 days from discharge to first visit to our hospital. Pre-existing respiratory comorbidity was present in 63%. History of hospitalisation was present in 52%. Fatigue (65%) was the most common symptom followed by breathlessness (60%), cough (45.71%) and chest pain (28.57%). Three patients had significant desaturation on 6-minute walk test and one patient had type 2 respiratory failure on presentation. Chest X-ray was abnormal in 34.28% (n=12). On CT thorax (n=17) the most common finding was diffuse reticulations (52.94%) followed by diffuse ground glass opacities (GGOs) (35.29%). One patient each were newly diagnosed as pulmonary tuberculosis and tubercular unilateral hilar lymphadenopathy. Conclusively, post-COVID-19 patients may have remnant symptoms like fatigue, breathlessness and cough. Also, patients with pre-existing respiratory diseases are more symptomatic and even may suffer from deterioration in the clinical course. Further we need to be alert of alternate diagnosis or infections like tuberculosis (TB) in these patients, especially in TB endemic countries like India. Simultaneously, the use of immunosuppressant drugs like steroids for COVID-19 management, predisposes to TB. A proper evaluation with holistic and standardised management plan is the need of the hour for post-COVID-19 patients, until its time course, evolution and manifestations are unravelled.","Goel, Nitin; Goyal, Nitesh; Kumar, Raj",Monaldi arch. chest dis,,135

We provide an epidemiologic and clinical report of SARS-CoV-2 infections in neonates hospitalized in Bangladesh. METHODS: Outborn neonates admitted to Dhaka Shishu Hospital, a tertiary-care referral hospital, between 29 March and 1 July were screened for SARS-CoV-2. We reviewed clinical data, including chest radiograph and laboratory reports, and conducted SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing. Patients were followed-up for 27-75 days. A subset of caregivers was also tested. RESULTS: Of 83 neonates tested, 26 were positive (median age 8 days). Most neonates were admitted with diagnosis unrelated to SARS-CoV-2: 11 presented with serious non-communicable diseases, 7 with early-onset sepsis, 5 with late-onset sepsis and 2 with pneumonia. In 3 of 5 chest radiograph, infiltrates and ground-glass or patchy opacities were noted. Two neonates developed metabolic acidosis, one developed disseminated intravascular coagulation. Most SARS-CoV-2 positive neonates were referred to government-designated COVID-19 hospitals, leading to gaps in treatment. Twenty-three neonates could be followed-up: 12 were healthy, 8 died and 3 were still seeking medical care. Of 9 caregivers tested, 8 were positive. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 may have serious adverse effects on children born in LMICs. The virus likely contributed directly to two deaths, but the remaining 6 neonates who died had serious comorbidities. Positive SARS-CoV-2 test results led to gaps in immediate clinical care for other morbidities, which likely contributed to adverse outcomes.

While highly potent mNAbs have great therapeutic potential, the ability of the virus to mutate and escape recognition and neutralization of mNAbs represents a potential problem in their use for the therapeutic management of SARS-CoV-2. Studies investigating natural or mNAb-induced antigenic variability in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) glycoprotein, and their effects on viral fitness are still rudimentary. In this manuscript we described experimental approaches for the selection, identification, and characterization of SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibody resistant mutants (MARMs) in cultured cells. The ability to study SARS-CoV-2 antigenic drift under selective immune pressure by mNAbs is important for the optimal implementation of mNAbs for the therapeutic management of COVID-19. This will help to identify essential amino acid residues in the viral S glycoprotein required for mNAb-mediated inhibition of viral infection, to predict potential natural drift variants that could emerge upon implementation of therapeutic mNAbs, as well as vaccine prophylactic treatments for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Additionally, it will also enable the assessment of MARM viral fitness and its potential to induce severe infection and associated COVID-19 disease.","Oladunni, Fatai S; Park, Jun-Gyu; Chiem, Kevin; Ye, Chengjin; Pipenbrink, Michael; Walter, Mark R; Kobie, James; Martinez-Sobrido, Luis",J Virol Methods,,135

For several years, we have been teaching an astro-animation class at the Maryland Institute College of Art as a collaboration between students and NASA scientists. Working in small groups, the students create short animations based on the research of the scientists who are going to follow the projects as mentors. By creating these animations, students bring the power of their imagination to see the research of the scientists through a different lens. Astro-animation is an undergraduate-level course jointly taught by an astrophysicist and an animator. In this paper we present the motivation behind the class, describe the details of how it is carried out, and discuss the interactions between artists and scientists. We describe how such a program offers an effective way for art students, not only to learn about science but to have a glimpse of""science in action"". The students have the opportunity to become involved in the process of science as artists, as observers first and potentially through their own art research. Every year, one or more internships at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center have been available for our students in the summer. Two students describe their experiences undertaking these internships and how science affects their creation of animations for this program and in general. We also explain the genesis of our astro-animation program, how it is taught in our animation department, and we present the highlights of an investigation of the effectiveness of this program we carried out with the support of an NEA research grant. In conclusion we discuss how the program may grow in new directions, such as contributing to informal STE(A)M learning.","Arcadias, Laurence; Corbet, Robin H.D.; McKenna, Declan; Potenziani, Isabella",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.06215v1.pdf,135

DESIGN: Online survey open from 2nd June 2020 to 15th July 2020. SETTING: United Kingdom. PARTICIPANTS: Lead Midwives for Education (LMEs). FINDINGS: A total of 38 of 55 LMEs responded (response rate 69%). The majority of Approved Education Institutions (AEIs) offered an extended placement to students, but with some variation in the choices offered, unrelated to geographical location or size of student cohort. AEIs appeared to provide the majority of decisional support for students. Many practice learning environments became unavailable, particularly community, gynaecology/medical wards and neonatal units. LMEs experienced both internal and external pressures to instigate rapid change. KEY CONCLUSIONS: The impact of COVID-19 on midwifery education is significant and will need continual scrutiny to minimise future detriment. The pressures of providing midwifery education throughout the early phase of COVID-19 were substantial, but it is important that we learn from the immediate changes made, value and pursue the changes that have been beneficial, and learn from those that were not. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE/RESEARCH: Student learning experiences have undergone significant change during the pandemic. It is essential to assess what effect the extended placement has had on student readiness for practice, their confidence, resilience, mental health, and attrition and retention. Educators transitioned to remote working, and rapidly assimilated new skills for online education; exploration of the impact of this is recommended.","Cooke, Alison; Hancock, Angela; White, Helen; Clark, Nicky; Gibb, Fiona; McNeill, Jenny; Thomas, Grace; Lloyd, Carmel; Furber, Christine",Midwifery,,135

433833,Immune responses to porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) in swine and protection against subsequent infection,2020,"A core goal of functional neuroimaging is to study how the environment is processed in the brain. The mainstream paradigm involves concurrently measuring a broad spectrum of brain responses to a small set of environmental features preselected with reference to previous studies or a theoretical framework. As a complement, we invert this approach by allowing the investigator to record the modulation of a preselected brain response by a broad spectrum of environmental features. Our approach is optimal when theoretical frameworks or previous empirical data are impoverished. By using a prespecified closed-loop design, the approach addresses fundamental challenges of reproducibility and generalisability in brain research. These conditions are particularly acute when studying the developing brain, where our theories based on adult brain function may fundamentally misrepresent the topography of infant cognition and where there are substantial practical challenges to data acquisition. Our methodology employs machine learning to map modulation of a neural feature across a space of experimental stimuli. Our method collects, processes and analyses EEG brain data in real-time; and uses a neuro-adaptive Bayesian optimisation algorithm to adjust the stimulus presented depending on the prior samples of a given participant. Unsampled stimuli can be interpolated by fitting a Gaussian process regression along the dataset. We show that our method can automatically identify the face of the infant's mother through online recording of their Nc brain response to a face continuum. We can retrieve model statistics of individualised responses for each participant, opening the door for early identification of atypical development. This approach has substantial potential in infancy research and beyond for improving power and generalisability of mapping the individual cognitive topography of brain function.","Costa, Pedro F. da; Haartsen, Rianne; Throm, Elena; Mason, Luke; Gui, Anna; Leech, Robert; Jones, Emily J.H.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.06029v1.pdf,135

Design: Prospective randomized study Materials and Methods: From 22/April/2020 to 25/may/2020, a survey through an online-platform was conducted Participants were randomized by age in one of the two groups: ART-GROUP (n=92), including patients seeking for fertility treatment, but still didn’t start their cycles or INTERESTED-GROUP (n=92), including participants interested in the subject, who accessed the website of a university-affiliated IVF-center Participants in the ART-GROUP were invited via e-mail, with a cover-letter outlining the survey and a link to access it Participants in the INTERESTED-GROUP accessed the questionnaire via website Information on demographic data and their perceptions in face of the COVID-19 pandemics and the motherhood plan was collected Women were asked: (i) How do you see the possibility of becoming pregnant after the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic? (ii) How long do you think that suppression strategies will last? and (iii) Did you postpone your plans to become pregnant? If yes, why? Results: Most patients in the ART-GROUP were married or in a common-law relationship (83 6%), while a half of women in the INTERESTED-GROUP were in the same situation (50 0% p&lt;0 001) When asked about the possibility of becoming pregnant, after the beginning of the pandemic, 47 8% of the ART-GROUP stated to believe the pandemic could affect their plans, while only 28 2% of the INTERESTED-GROUP stated the same (p=0 035) Concerning the duration of the suppression strategies, 64 1% of patients in ART-GROUP stated to believe the suppression strategies will be over by July, while only 18 5% of women in the INTERESTED-GROUP believed the same (p&lt;0 001) The plan to become pregnant was postponed by 41 3% of the ART-GROUP and by 57 6 1% of the INTERESTED-GROUP (p=0 341) The main reasons that led people to this decision were fear of getting sick (52 6% vs 73 6%, p=0 083, for ART-GROUP and INTERESTED-GROUP, respectively) and economic reasons (47 3% vs 24 5%, p=0 085 FOR ART-GROUP and INTERESTED-GROUP, respectively) Conclusions: Besides the fear of becoming sick, the economic burdens are the main reason for the delay in the motherhood plain, especially among women seeking for fertility care This may be due to the fear of future economic instabilities and the fact that, in Brazil, ART do not qualify for reimbursement","Paes de Almeida Ferreira Braga, D.; Setti, A.

Voice therapy faces a double challenge, interventions using telepractice, and delivering rehabilitation services to a growing population of patients at risk of functional impairment related to the COVID-19 disease. Moreover, as COVID-19 is transmitted through droplets, it is critical to understand how to mitigate these risks during assessment and treatment. OBJECTIVE: To promote safety, and effective clinical practice to voice assessment and rehabilitation in the pandemic COVID-19 context for speech-language pathologists. METHODS: A group of 11 experts in voice and swallowing disorders from five different countries conducted a consensus recommendation following the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery rules building a clinical guide for speech-language pathologists during this pandemic context. RESULT: The clinical guide provides 79 recommendations for clinicians in the management of voice disorders during the pandemic and includes advice from assessment, direct treatment, telepractice, and teamwork. The consensus was reached 95% for all topics. CONCLUSION: This guideline should be taken only as recommendation; each clinician must attempt to mitigate the risk of infection and achieve the best therapeutic results taking into account the patient's particular reality.","Castillo-Allendes, Adrián; Contreras-Ruston, Francisco; Cantor, Lady; Codino, Juliana; Guzman, Marco; Malebran, Celina; Manzano, Carlos; Pavez, Axel; Vaiano, Thays; Wilder, Fabiana; Behlau, Mara",J. voice,,135

516154,Porcine epidemic diarrhea altered colonic microbiota communities in suckling piglets,2020,"The COVID-19 is an established threat whose clinical features and epidemiology continues to evolve. In an effort to contain the disease, the National Health Service has adopted a digital first approach in UK general practice resulting in a significant shift away from face-to-face consultations. Consequently, more consultations are being completed without obtaining objective recording of vital signs and face-to-face examination. Some regions have formed hot hubs to facilitate the review of suspected COVID-19 cases and keep their practice site 'clean' including the use of doorstep observations in avoiding the risk of face-to-face examination. To support the safe, effective and efficient remote assessment of suspected and confirmed patients with COVID-19, we established a doorstep assessment service to compliment telephone and video consultations. This allows physiological parameters such as temperature, pulse, blood pressure and oxygen saturation to be obtained to guide further triage. Quality improvement methods were used to integrate and optimise the doorstep assessment and measure the improvements made. The introduction of a doorstep assessment service increased the proportion of assessments for patients with suspected COVID-19 in routine care over weeks. At the same time we were able to dramatically reduce face-to-face assessment over a 6-week period by optimising through a range of measures including the introduction of a digital stethoscope. The majority of patients were managed by their own general practitioner following assessment supporting continuity of care. There were no adverse events during the period of observation; no staff absences related to COVID-19. Quality improvement methods have facilitated the successful integration of doorstep assessments into clinical care.","Irving, Greg; Lawson, David; Tinsley, Adele; Parr, Helen; Whittaker, Cheryl; Jones, Hayley; Cox, Stephen",,,135
516464,Low-level contamination of deoxynivalenol: A threat from environmental toxins to porcine epidemic diarrhea virus infection,2020,"INTRODUCTION: The ongoing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 pandemic has expanded globally. The aim of the current study is to investigate the knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) of health care professionals in Greece towards SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: From 10-25 February 2020, 500 health care workers were approached. Knowledge, attitudes, and practices towards SARS-CoV-2 were assessed via a personal interview questionnaire. For knowledge, each correct answer was given 1 point; attitudes, or concerns aimed at prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and practices, or behaviors towards performing preventive practices, were assigned 1 point each. Points were summed and a score for each category was calculated. RESULTS: A total of 461 health care workers returned the questionnaire and were included in the analysis (mean age ± SD: 44.2 ± 10.78 years, 74% females). The majority were nurses (47.5%), followed by physicians (30.5%) and paramedics (19%). The majority of subjects (88.28%) had a good level of knowledge (knowledge score equal to 4, or more). The majority of participants (71%) agreed with the temporary traveling restrictions ban. The uptake of a future vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 was estimated at 43%. Knowledge score was significantly associated with both attitudes score (p = 0.011) and practices score (p < 0.001), indicating that subjects with a high knowledge score demonstrated a more positive perception on preventive measures and would practice more preventive measures. Attitudes score was significantly associated with practices score (p = 0.009) indicating that subjects with a higher attitudes score are more likely to perform practices towards the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. CONCLUSION: There is a high level of knowledge concerning SARS-CoV-2 pandemic among Greek health care workers and this is significantly associated with positive attitudes and practices towards preventive health measures. The high level of knowledge of health professionals about SARS-CoV-2 may have contributed considerably to the successful management of the pandemic in Greece. Tailored educational campaigns aiming to increase the proportion of health care workers willing to accept a potential SARS-CoV-2 vaccine could be of paramount importance in future proactive vaccine educational campaigns.","Papagiannis, Dimitrios; Malli, Foteini; Raptis, Dimitrios G; Papathanasiou, Ioanna V; Fradelos, Evangelos C; Daniil, Zoe; Rachiotis, Georgios; Gourgoulianis, Konstantinos I",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,135

Although most SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals manifest with a self-limited mild disease that resolves with supportive care in the outpatient setting, patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 will require a multidisciplinary collaborative management approach for optimal care in the hospital setting. Laboratory and radiologic studies provide critical information on disease severity, management options, and overall prognosis. Medical management is mostly supportive with antipyretics, hydration, oxygen supplementation, and other measures as dictated by clinical need. Among its medical complications is a characteristic proinflammatory cytokine storm often associated with end-organ dysfunction, including respiratory failure, liver and renal insufficiency, cardiac injury, and coagulopathy. Specific recommendations for the management of these medical complications are discussed. Despite the issuance of emergency use authorization for remdesivir, there are still no proven effective antiviral and immunomodulatory therapies, and their use in COVID-19 management should be guided by clinical trial protocols or treatment registries. The medical care of patients with COVID-19 extends beyond their hospitalization. Postdischarge follow-up and monitoring should be performed, preferably using telemedicine, until the patients have fully recovered from their illness and are released from home quarantine protocols.","Razonable, Raymund R; Pennington, Kelly M; Meehan, Anne M; Wilson, John W; Froemming, Adam T; Bennett, Courtney E; Marshall, Ariela L; Virk, Abinash; Carmona, Eva M",Mayo Clin Proc,,135

524076,Detection of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus-neutralizing antibody using high-throughput imaging cytometry,2020,"BACKGROUND: Early and accurate detection and staging is critical to managing Alzheimer's disease (AD) and supporting clinical trials. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers for amyloid-ß peptides, tau species, and various neurodegenerative and inflammatory analytes are leading the way in this regard, yet there is room for improved sensitivity and specificity. In particular tau is known to be present in many different fragments, conformations, and post-translationally modified forms. While the exact tau species that might best reflect AD pathology is unknown, a growing body of evidence suggests that forms with high levels of phosphorylation in the mid-region may be especially enriched in AD. OBJECTIVE: Develop an assay for measuring p217tau in CSF. METHODS: Here we describe the development and validation of a novel sELISA for measuring CSF tau species containing phosphorylation at threonines 212 & 217, aka p217â+âtau, using the PT3 antibody. RESULTS: While the analyte is present at extremely low levels the assay is sufficiently sensitive and specific to quantitate p217â+âtau with excellent precision, accuracy, and dilution linearity, allowing good differentiation between diagnostic subgroups. The p217â+âtau measurements appear to track AD pathology better than the commonly used p181tau epitope, suggesting superior diagnostic and staging performance. Finally, the assay can also be configured to differentiate antibody-bound versus antibody-free tau, and therefore can be used to measure target engagement by p217â+âtau-targeting immunotherapeutics. CONCLUSION: The assay for measuring p217â+âtau described here is highly sensitive, accurate, precise, dilution linear, and shows good potential for identifying and staging AD.","Triana-Baltzer, Gallen; Van Kolen, Kristof; Theunis, Clara; Moughadam, Setareh; Slemmon, Randy; Mercken, Marc; Galpern, Wendy; Sun, Hong; Kolb, Hartmuth",J. alzheimers dis,,135

Néanmoins, 71 % des prélèvements reviennent négatifs. En effet, les rhinovirus, coronavirus et adénovirus ne sont pas recherchés en routine. Conclusion Ainsi, 37 cas d’hMPV ont pu être recensés entraînant la mise en place de précautions complémentaires (gouttelettes et contact). Les nourrissons sont principalement touchés. Sans cette détection, les patients n’auraient probablement pas été isolés facilitant, de fait, la transmission nosocomiale du virus.","Cassier, P.; Bertaut, A.; Fournel, I.; Muggeo, E.; Bour, J.-B.; Aho, S.",Médecine et Maladies Infectieuses,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0399077X09743355; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0399077X09743355,135
591413,"Molecular Characterization of Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus, a Member of the Arterivirus Group",1993-03-31,"The present study examined individual characteristics potentially associated with changes in mitigation behaviors (social distancing and hygiene) recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Analysis of online survey responses from 361 adults, ages 20–78, with US IP addresses, identified significant correlates of adaptive behavioral changes, with implications for preventive strategies and mental health needs. The extent to which individuals changed their mitigation behaviors was unrelated to self-rated health or concern regarding the personal effects of COVID-19 but was related to concern regarding the effects of the pandemic on others. Thus, mitigation behaviors do not appear to be primarily motivated by self-protection. Importantly, adaptive changes in mitigation behaviors increased with age. However, these changes, particularly those related to the frequency of close proximity encounters, appear to be due to age-related decreases in anxiety and depression. Taken together, the present results argue against over-reliance on ‘fear appeals’ in public health messages as they may increase anxiety and depression. Instead, the present findings argue for more appeals to people’s concern for others to motivate mitigation as well as indicating an immediate need to address individual mental health concerns for the sake of society as a whole.","Myerson, Joel; Strube, Michael J.; Green, Leonard; Hale, Sandra",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0257658; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34547057/,135
591581,The GPRLQPY motif located at the carboxy-terminal of the spike protein induces antibodies that neutralize Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus,2007-12-11,"OBJECTIVE: At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Netherlands, the Dutch Working Party on Antibiotic Policy constructed an advisory document about off-label drug treatment options that was regularly updated with new scientific findings. The aim of this study is to describe the dynamics in applied COVID-19 pharmacotherapy during the first 100 days of the pandemic and to assess how the national advisory document influenced local hospital policies. METHODS: A multicentre observational cohort study was conducted in six hospitals in the Netherlands. Patients with confirmed COVID-19 admitted between 27 February and 7 June 2020 were studied. Drug prescription data were collected and percentages of patients receiving a specific treatment were calculated. These percentages were plotted together with release dates of the national advisory document. Semi-structured in-depth interviews with hospital pharmacists and infectious diseases specialists were conducted to gain insight into the development and implementation of pharmacotherapy treatment protocols in hospitals. RESULTS: Data from 1511 patients (60% men, mean age 66 years) were analysed. From mid-March (hydroxy)chloroquine was being prescribed in all six hospitals to approximately 70% of patients at admission. Frequencies of other off-label treatments were below 2%. In the week of 6 April 2020, the first hospital discontinued prescribing (hydroxy)chloroquine and the last hospital discontinued in the week of 4 May 2020 (total range −19 to +10 days after the national advisory document advised against its use (1 May 2020)). All interviewees (n=6) stated that the hospitals based their policies mainly on the national advisory document but also assessed scientific literature themselves. Order panels were constructed to support prescribing. CONCLUSION: Dutch hospitals opted en masse for (hydroxy)chloroquine as COVID-19 therapy at the start of the pandemic, although the time until the therapy was no longer prescribed differed by several weeks. The fact that hospitals defined pharmacotherapy regimens based on their own assessment of the scientific literature besides the national advisory document can explain this variation.","Uitvlugt, Elien B; Soeng, Danny Y F; van der Linden, Paul; van de Garde, Ewoudt Meine Walraven",Eur J Hosp Pharm,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34272215/; https://doi.org/10.1136/ejhpharm-2021-002781,135
591865,"Genome characterization, antigenicity and pathogenicity of a novel infectious bronchitis virus type isolated from south China",2017-08-08,"Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) is recognized as the causative agent of porcine circovirus-associated diseases. PCV2 replication could be promoted by low doses of ochratoxin A (OTA) as in our previous study and selenium has been shown to attenuate PCV2 replication. However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of selenomethionine (SeMet), the major component of organic selenium, on OTA-induced PCV2 replication promotion and its potential mechanism. The present study demonstrates that OTA could promote PCV2 replication as measured by cap protein expression, viral titer, viral DNA copies and the number of infected cells. In addition, OTA could activate autophagy as indicated by up-regulated light chain 3 (LC3)-II and autophagy-related protein 5 expressions and autophagosome formation. Further, OTA could down-regulate p-AKT and p-mTOR expressions and OTA-induced autophagy was inhibited when insulin was applied. SeMet at 2, 4 and 6 μM had significant inhibiting effects against OTA-induced PCV2 replication promotion. Furthermore, SeMet could attenuate OTA-induced autophagy and up-regulate OTA-induced p-AKT and p-mTOR expression inhibition. Rapamycin, an inhibitor of AKT/mTOR, could reverse the effects of SeMet on OTA-induced autophagy and the PCV2 replication promotion. In conclusion, SeMet could block OTA-induced PCV2 replication promotion by inhibiting autophagy by activating the AKT/mTOR pathway. Therefore, SeMet supplementation could be an effective prophylactic strategy against PCV2 infections and autophagy may be a potential marker to develop novel anti-PCV2 drugs.","Qian, Gang; Liu, Dandan; Hu, Junfa; Gan, Fang; Hou, Lili; Zhai, Nianhui; Chen, Xingxiang; Huang, Kehe",Vet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29439710/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13567-018-0508-z,135

Although human disease is often asymptomatic, some develop severe illnesses such as pneumonia, respiratory failure, and death. There is an urgent need for a vaccine to prevent its rapid spread as asymptomatic infections accounting for up to 40% of transmission events. Here we further evaluated an inactivated rabies vectored SARS-CoV-2 S1 vaccine CORAVAX in a Syrian hamster model. CORAVAX adjuvanted with MPLA-AddaVax, a TRL4 agonist, induced high levels of neutralizing antibodies and generated a strong Th1-biased immune response. Vaccinated hamsters were protected from weight loss and viral replication in the lungs and nasal turbinates three days after challenge with SARS-CoV-2. CORAVAX also prevented lung disease, as indicated by the significant reduction in lung pathology. This study highlights CORAVAX as a safe, immunogenic, and efficacious vaccine that warrants further assessment in human trials.","Kurup, Drishya; Malherbe, Delphine C.; Wirblich, Christoph; Lambert, Rachael; Ronk, Adam J.; Zabihi Diba, Leila; Bukreyev, Alexander; Schnell, Matthias J.",PLoS Pathog,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1009383; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33765062/,135
593229,Development of transgenic mouse model expressing porcine aminopeptidase N and its susceptibility to porcine epidemic diarrhea virus,2015-02-02,"Accurate, rapid, and low-cost molecular diagnostics is essential in managing outbreaks of infectious diseases, such as the pandemic of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Accordingly, microfluidic paper-based analytical devices (μPADs) have emerged as promising diagnostic tools. Among the extensive efforts to improve the performance and usability of μPADs, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) based sensing mechanisms have shown great promise, because of their high sensitivity and label-free operations. However, the method to improve EIS biosensing on μPADs is less explored. Here, we present an experimental approach to enhancing the biosensing performance of paper-based EIS nanobiosensors with working electrodes (WEs) decorated with vertically grown zinc oxide nanowires (ZnO NWs). Through a comparison among different EIS settings and an examination of ZnO-WE effects on EIS measurements, we show that Faradaic processes with Fe-based electron mediators are more reliable for ZnO-NW-enhanced working electrodes. We calibrate sensors featuring varied morphologies of ZnO NWs and achieve a low limit of detection (0.4 pg ml(−1)) for detecting p24 antigen as a marker for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Through theoretical analysis, imaging, and electrochemical characterizations, we reveal that the total surface area and electrochemical surface area indicate the sensitivity and sensing range of the EIS nanobiosensors. Finally, we demonstrate that the nanobiosensors are capable of differentiating the concentrations (blank, 10 ng ml(−1), 100 ng ml(−1), and 1 μg ml(−1)) of IgG antibody (CR3022) to SARS-CoV-2 in human serum samples, thus confirming the feasibility of applying the devices to COVID-19 diagnosis. This work provides a methodology that can inform the rational design of high-performance EIS-based μPADs and has the potential to facilitate rapid diagnosis in pandemics.","Li, Xiao; Qin, Zhen; Fu, Hao; Li, Ted; Peng, Ran; Li, Zhijie; Rini, James M.; Liu, Xinyu",Biosens Bioelectron,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33461849/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2020.112672; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0956566320306618?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0956566320306618,135

In this case report, we describe the clinical features of 5 rheumatic immune disease patients with the concomitant presence of COVID-19. Amongst these patients, 4 had rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and 1 had systemic sclerosis (SSc). Two patients had a history of close contact with a COVID-19 patient. The age of the patients ranged between 51 and 79 years. Fever (80%), cough (80%), dyspnea (40%), and fatigue (20%) were the most common presenting symptoms. Laboratory investigations revealed leukopenia and lymphopenia in 2 patients. In all the patients, chest computerized tomography (CT) revealed patchy ground glass opacities in the lungs. During the hospital stay, the condition of two patients remained the same (i.e., mild COVID-19), two patients progressed to the severe COVID-19, and one patient worsened to the critically ill COVID-19.

603659,Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea in Europe: In-Detail Analyses of Disease Dynamics and Molecular Epidemiology,2017-07-06,"Background: Many nutrients have powerful immunomodulatory actions with the potential to alter susceptibility to COVID-19 infection, progression to symptoms, likelihood of severe disease and survival. The pandemic has fostered many nutrition-related theories, sometimes backed by a biased interpretation of evidence. Objectives: To provide a systematic review of the latest evidence on how malnutrition across all its forms (under- and over-nutrition and micronutrient status) may influence both susceptibility to, and progression and severity of, COVID-19. Methods: We synthesised information on 13 nutrition-related components and their potential interactions with COVID-19: overweight, obesity and diabetes; protein-energy malnutrition; anaemia; vitamins A, C, D, and E; poly-unsaturated fatty acids; iron; selenium; zinc; anti-oxidants, and nutritional support. For each section we provide: a) a landscape review of pertinent material; b) a systematic search of the literature in PubMed and EMBASE databases, including a systematic search of a wide range of pre-print servers; and c) a screen of six clinical trial registries. Two reviewers were assigned per section for data extraction. All original research was considered, without restriction to study design, and included if it covered: 1) SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV viruses and 2) disease susceptibility or 3) disease progression, and 4) the nutritional component of interest. Searches took place between 16th May and 11th August, 2020. PROSPERO registration CRD42020186194. Results: Across the 13 searches, a total of 2732 articles from PubMed and EMBASE, 4164 articles from the pre-print servers, and 433 trials were returned. A total of 288 published articles and 278 pre-print articles were taken to full text screening. In the final narrative synthesis, we cover 22 published articles, 39 pre-print articles and 79 trials. The review highlights a range of mechanistic and observational evidence to highlight the role nutrition can play in susceptibility and progression of COVID-19. However, to date, there is limited evidence that high-dose supplements of micronutrients will either prevent severe disease or speed up recovery, although results of clinical trials are eagerly awaited. Conclusions: To date there is no conclusive evidence supporting adoption of novel nutritional therapies. However, given the known impacts of all forms of malnutrition on the immune system, public health strategies to reduce micronutrient deficiencies and undernutrition remain of critical importance. There is strong evidence that prevention of obesity, and its consequent type-2 diabetes, will reduce the risk of serious COVID-19 outcomes.","James, P. T.; Ali, Z.; Armitage, A.

604349,Full genome sequence analysis of a newly emerged QX-like infectious bronchitis virus from Sudan reveals distinct spots of recombination,2016-10-26,"Since the early 2000s, there has been a long-term price increase trend in the Istanbul housing market, and this situation also has led to price bubble speculations. Since the housing sector was caught with a high level of unsold housing stock to the economic slowdown emerging in the second half of 2018, housing price bubble speculations have increased even more, especially for the Istanbul market. In this period, housing loan interest reduction campaigns were implemented by the government through state banks to stimulate the housing demand, and a probable collapse in the housing market was prevented. On the other hand, house prices continued to rise during this period due to the stimulated demand. In this paper, we perform a price bubble research on the selected districts in the Istanbul housing market over the 2007–2019 period using LSTM autoencoder model. The first analysis on monthly data is performed by using housing price index, housing rent index, consumer prices index, stock market index, return on government debt securities, USD/TRY exchange rates, BIST price index, monthly deposit interest rates, mortgage interest rates and consumer confidence index, and the second analysis on quarterly data is carried out by adding building construction cost index and GDP data to the previous dataset. In the first analysis, the bubble formations differ regionally and periodically and disappeared toward the end of 2019 in some districts, while in the second analysis, the housing bubble formations have a more common and continuous appearance.

604586,Infectious Bronchitis Virus Nonstructural Protein 4 Alone Induces Membrane Pairing,2018-09-06,"Public health seeks to improve health at a population level through interventions that increase the net health benefit to the population as a whole. Advances in genomics knowledge and technologies can add to this endeavor, but also pose a challenge when faced with often conflicting public health (population) and genomic medicine (individual) perspectives. Combining the fields of genomic, population, and social sciences, population genomics or public health genomics looks at the promotion of health and prevention of disease using genomic knowledge through the lens of populations rather than individuals. In this chapter we will survey the three major disciplines contributing to population genomics (genomics, population, and social sciences) and explore two cross-cutting issues: global health and population versus individual health, using specific examples from diseases such as asthma, colon cancer, and cystic fibrosis.","Wise, A.L.; Manolio, T.A.",Medical and Health Genomics,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B978012420196500023X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B978012420196500023X,135
605071,Identification of the strain-specifically truncated nonstructural protein 10 of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus in infected cells,2018-05-31,"Background: The demonstration that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) enters the cell via the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor has raised concerns that, in hereditary angioedema (HAE), a disease characterized by bradykinin-mediated angioedema attacks, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may trigger angioedema attacks, increase the frequency and/or severity of attacks, or cause more severe symptoms of COVID-19. Objective: The objective was to evaluate the severity of COVID-19 in patients with HAE, the course of HAE attacks, angioedema activity, and the quality-of-life scores during COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Patients diagnosed with HAE for at least 6 months were included in the study. The 7-day Angioedema Activity Score and the Angioedema Quality of Life (AE-QoL) Questionnaire were first completed at the onset of the pandemic between March 12 and June 1, 2020, then during SARS-CoV-2 infection, and in the third month after recovering from COVID-19. Results: Ten of 67 patients with HAE (14.9%) were diagnosed with COVID-19. The median (interquartile range) age of the 10 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 was 35.5 years (28.0-55.0 years). Six of the 10 patients (60%) were women. During COVID-19, five of the 10 patients (50%) had no angioedema attack. Two patients with severe HAE experienced a significant increase in angioedema activity during COVID-19 compared with their basal activity scores. The remaining three patients had a similar or lower attack frequency than their basal level. Four (40%) of the 10 patients had a relative increase in their attacks during the convalescence period. There was no statistically significant difference among pre-COVID-19, during COVID-19 and post-COVID-19 periods in function, mood, fear and/or shame, nutrition, and total scores of the AE-QoL Questionnaire although the fear dimension was relatively more affected (p = 0.06). Conclusion: Although the sample size was small, analysis of our data supported that the symptoms of COVID-19 were not more severe in HAE. Also, there was no significant difference in the AE-QoL Questionnaire scores, the frequency, and severity of angioedema attacks during the course of COVID-19 in the patients with HAE.","Can Bostan, Ozge; Tuncay, Gulseren; Damadoglu, Ebru; Karakaya, Gul; Kalyoncu, Ali Fuat",Allergy and asthma proceedings,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34474710/; https://doi.org/10.2500/aap.2021.42.210066,135

608496,Experimental Evidence of Recombination in Coronavirus Infectious Bronchitis Virus,1995-11-30,"BACKGROUND: Shared care is the preferred model for long-term survivorship care by cancer survivors, general practitioners and specialists. However, survivorship care remains specialist-led. A risk-stratified approach has been proposed to select suitable patients for long-term shared care after survivors have completed adjuvant cancer treatment. This study aims to use patient scenarios to explore views on patient suitability for long-term colorectal cancer shared care across the risk spectrum from survivors, general practitioners and specialists. METHODS: Participants completed a brief questionnaire assessing demographics and clinical issues before a semi-structured in-depth interview. The interviews focused on the participant’s view on suitability for long term cancer shared care, challenges and facilitators in delivering it and resources that would be helpful. We conducted thematic analysis using an inductive approach to discover new concepts and themes. RESULTS: Interviews were conducted with 10 cancer survivors, 6 general practitioners and 9 cancer specialists. The main themes that emerged were patient-centredness, team resilience underlined by mutual trust and stronger system supports by way of cancer-specific training, survivorship care protocols, shared information systems, care coordination and navigational supports. CONCLUSIONS: Decisions on the appropriateness of this model for patients need to be made collaboratively with cancer survivors, considering their trust and relationship with their general practitioners and the support they need. Further research on improving mutual trust and operationalising support systems would assist in the integration of shared survivorship care.

S-layers are generally the most abundantly expressed proteins, have been observed in species of nearly every taxonomical group of walled bacteria, and represent an almost universal feature of archaeal envelopes. The isoporous lattices completely covering the cell surface provide organisms with various selection advantages including functioning as protective coats, molecular sieves and ion traps, as structures involved in surface recognition and cell adhesion, and as antifouling layers. S-layers are also identified to contribute to virulence when present as a structural component of pathogens. In Archaea, most of which possess S-layers as exclusive wall component, they are involved in determining cell shape and cell division. Studies on structure, chemistry, genetics, assembly, function, and evolutionary relationship of S-layers revealed considerable application potential in (nano)biotechnology, biomimetics, biomedicine, and synthetic biology.","Sleytr, Uwe B; Schuster, Bernhard; Egelseer, Eva-Maria; Pum, Dietmar",FEMS Microbiol Rev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24483139/; https://doi.org/10.1111/1574-6976.12063,135

While most of the current understanding of the clinical features of COVID-19 is derived from Chinese studies, there is a relative paucity of reports from the remaining global health community. In this study, we analyze the clinical and radiologic factors that correlate with mortality odds in COVID-19 positive patients from a tertiary care center in Tehran, Iran. A retrospective cohort study of 90 patients with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) positive COVID-19 infection was conducted, analyzing demographics, co-morbidities, presenting symptoms, vital signs, laboratory values, chest radiograph findings, and chest CT features based on mortality. Chest radiograph was assessed using the Radiographic Assessment of Lung Edema (RALE) scoring system. Chest CTs were assessed according to the opacification pattern, distribution, and standardized severity score. Initial and follow-up Chest CTs were compared if available. Multiple logistic regression was used to generate a prediction model for mortality. The 90 patients included 59 men and 31 women (59.4 ± 16.6 years), including 21 deceased and 69 surviving patients. Among clinical features, advanced age (p = 0.02), low oxygenation saturation (p<0.001), leukocytosis (p = 0.02), low lymphocyte fraction (p = 0.03), and low platelet count (p = 0.048) were associated with increased mortality. High RALE score on initial chest radiograph (p = 0.002), presence of pleural effusions on initial CT chest (p = 0.005), development of pleural effusions on follow-up CT chest (p = 0.04), and worsening lung severity score on follow-up CT Chest (p = 0.03) were associated with mortality. A two-factor logistic model using patient age and oxygen saturation was created, which demonstrates 89% accuracy and area under the ROC curve of 0.86 (p<0.0001). Specific demographic, clinical, and imaging features are associated with increased mortality in COVID-19 infections. Attention to these features can help optimize patient management.","Homayounieh, Fatemeh; Zhang, Eric W.; Babaei, Rosa; Karimi Mobin, Hadi; Sharifian, Maedeh; Mohseni, Iman; Kuo, Anderson; Arru, Chiara; Kalra, Mannudeep K.; Digumarthy, Subba R.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32970733/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0239519,135

The present study aims to explore possible relationships between parental beliefs about childhood and adolescence from a longitudinal and qualitative perspective. The beliefs held by parents of teenagers about adolescence are compared with those they hold about childhood at that same moment, and the evolution of these ideas is charted over the course of 16 years as their children grow. A total of 102 parents participated in the longitudinal study. They completed two types of semi-structured interviews: one of them throughout the entire study period and the other once their children became teenagers. The results reveal an association between the type of beliefs parents hold about childhood and their perception of adolescence, and they indicate that these ideas change over time as more adjusted and modern beliefs about child development correlate with a more positive perception of adolescence. These results are interpreted from the perspective of their influence on beliefs about parenting styles, reflecting what is reported in the recent literature regarding the most successful styles for fostering children’s and adolescents’ psychosocial adjustment.","Ridao, Pilar; López-Verdugo, Isabel; Reina-Flores, Carmen",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18041760; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33670282/,135

Convalescent serum and blood were used to treat patients during outbreaks of Zaire ebolavirus (ZEBOV) infection in 1976 and 1995, with inconclusive results. During the recent 2013–2016 West African epidemic, serum/plasma from survivors of ZEBOV infection was used to treat patients in the affected countries and several repatriated patients. The effectiveness of this strategy remains unknown. Methods. Nine rhesus monkeys were experimentally infected with ZEBOV-Makona. Beginning on day 3 after exposure (at the onset of viremia), 4 animals were treated with homologous ZEBOV-Makona convalescent macaque sera, 3 animals were treated in parallel with heterologous Sudan ebolavirus (SEBOV) convalescent macaque sera, and 2 animals served as positive controls and were not treated. Surviving animals received additional treatments on days 6 and 9. Results. Both untreated control animals died on postinfection day 9. All 4 ZEBOV-Makona–infected macaques treated with homologous ZEBOV-Makona convalescent sera died on days 8–9. One macaque treated with heterologous SEBOV convalescent sera survived, while the other animals treated with the heterologous SEBOV sera died on days 7 and 9. Conclusions. The findings suggest that convalescent sera alone is not sufficient for providing 100% protection against lethal ZEBOV infection when administered at the onset of viremia.","Mire, Chad E.; Geisbert, Joan B.; Agans, Krystle N.; Thi, Emily P.; Lee, Amy C.H.; Fenton, Karla A.; Geisbert, Thomas W.",Journal of Infectious Diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27571900/; https://academic.oup.com/jid/article-pdf/214/suppl_3/S367/7937501/jiw333.pdf,135

Hematological ratios are indicators of inflammatory response widely used in viral pneumonia with affordability in developing countries. PURPOSE: Study the role of the neutrophil lymphocyte ratio (NLR), derived NLR ratio (d-NLR), platelet lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and lymphocyte monocyte ratio (LMR) in predicting the outcome of COVID-19 Egyptian patients. METHODS: A retrospective study on 496 COVID-19 Egyptian patients, managed in four tertiary centers, grouped into non-severe, severe, and critical. Patients’ laboratory assessment including total leucocyte count (TLC), absolute neutrophil count (ANC), absolute lymphocyte count (ALC), absolute monocyte count (AMC), NLR, d-NLR, LMR and, PLR were reported as well as C reactive protein (CRP), D-dimer and serum ferritin. RESULTS: TLC, ANC, AMC, NLR, d-NLR and, PLR were highest in the critical group (p<0.001 for all except AMC p=0.033), while this group had the least ALC and LMR (p=0.049 and <0.001, respectively). Higher CRP and d-dimer levels were reported in the critical group (p<0.001). At the same time, higher ferritin was found in the severe group more than the critical and non-severe groups (p<0.001, p=0.005, respectively). We calculated the optimal cut-off values of the hematological ratio; NLR (3.5), d-NLR (2.86), PLR (192), and LMR (3). D-NLR had the highest specificity (89.19%), while NLR had the highest sensitivity (71.38%). By univariate logistic regression, age, DM, HTN, cardiovascular diseases, COPD, NLR, d-NLR, LMR and PLR, CRP, steroid, oxygen aids, and mechanical ventilation were associated with the severity of COVID-19. Still, only age, NLR, CRP, and oxygen aid were independent predictors in multivariate logistic regression. CONCLUSION: NLR is a predictor for severity in COVID-19. LMR, d-NLR, and PLR may assist in risk stratification.","Aly, Mai M; Meshref, Taghreed S; Abdelhameid, Marwa A; Ahmed, Shimaa A; Shaltout, Asmaa S; Abdel-Moniem, Alaa Eldin; Hamad, Dina A",J Blood Med,https://doi.org/10.2147/jbm.s316681; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34234607/,135

Meanwhile, the knowledge regarding their safety has been rapidly changing, which could be a challenge for a medical practitioner. The purpose of this review is to summarize the latest reports and to verify statements on e-cigarettes' influence on health, including the context of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Awareness of the benefits of e-cigarettes can provide vital support for doctors caring for patients who smoke traditional cigarettes. Nevertheless, the attention should be paid to the dangers of the medically unjustified use of electronic cigarettes. Despite the idea of releasing e-cigarettes to the market as a harmless alternative to traditional ones, this product also has a negative impact on health. A replacement of traditional cigarettes with e-cigarettes provides well documented benefits to patients with certain indications, such as hypertension and asthma, as well as to smokers who intend to minimize negative effect of passive smoking on their environment. Moreover, it could be valuable for patients who are willing to permanently overcome a nicotine addiction, especially when previous attempts to quit smoking with nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) monotherapy were unsuccessful. Electronic cigarettes are a rapidly developing technology and an innovative form of a well-known addiction, so it is essential for practitioners to stay informed.","Kruszewski, Jakub; Worobiej, Daniel; Kolasinska, Weronika; Sokolowski, Rafal Andrzej; Rzad, Michal",Adv. respir. med.

This study aims to identify the clinical and demographic factors influencing the time taken for viral clearance in patients with COVID-19 to determine the optimal isolation period. Methods This two-center retrospective observational cohort study was conducted between March 1 and June 31, 2020. Patients with COVID-19, which was confirmed by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, were included. Data were extracted from medical records. The positive duration, which was defined as the period from the day of symptom onset to the negative conversion day, was assessed using a generalized linear model. Results We included 63 patients. The mean positive duration was 20 days. The positive duration was significantly shorter for patients younger than 30 years of age and those between 30 and 60 years of age than for patients older than 60 years of age. We observed a more scattered distribution of the positive duration in older patients than in younger patients. Conclusions Younger patients who recovered from COVID-19 took less time to clear SARS-CoV-2 than older patients; thus, a classification of the isolation periods based on age could be considered. A uniform viral clearance period for older patients may be difficult to determine because of biases such as underlying medical conditions. Further surveillance measures are recommended to determine the viral clearance time and the optimal isolation period.","Hirai, Nobuyasu; Nishioka, Yuichi; Sekine, Takahiro; Nishihara, Yuji; Okuda, Nao; Nishimura, Tomoko; Fujikura, Hiroyuki; Imakita, Natsuko; Fukumori, Tatsuya; Ogawa, Taku; Hishiya, Naokuni; Suzuki, Yuki; Nakano, Ryuichi; Yano, Hisakazu; Sato, Masatoshi; Koichi, Maeda; Imamura, Tomoaki; Kasahara, Kei",J Infect Chemother,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jiac.2021.02.015; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1341321X21000556; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33642249/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1341321X21000556?v=s5,135

We aimed to rapidly evaluate the impact and effectiveness of these communication materials for passengers in the early stages of the pandemic. Methods In stage I (Patient and Public Involvement, PPI) we interviewed seven travellers who had returned from China in January and February 2020. We used these results to develop a questionnaire and topic guides for stage II, a cross-sectional survey and follow-up interviews with passengers arriving at London Heathrow Airport on scheduled flights from China and Singapore. The survey assessed passengers' knowledge of symptoms, actions to take and attitudes towards PHE COVID-19 public health information; interviews explored their views of official public health information and self-isolation. Results In stage II, 121 passengers participated in the survey and 15 in follow-up interviews. 83% of surveyed passengers correctly identified all three COVID-19 associated symptoms listed in PHE information at that time. Most could identify the recommended actions and found the advice understandable and trustworthy. Interviews revealed that passengers shared concerns about the lack of wider official action, and that passengers' knowledge had been acquired elsewhere as much from PHE. Respondents also noted their own agency in choosing to self-isolate, partially as a self-protective measure. Conclusion PHE COVID-19 public health information was perceived as clear and acceptable, but we found that passengers acquired knowledge from various sources and they saw the provision of information alone on arrival as an insufficient official response. Our study provides fresh insights into the importance of taking greater account of diverse information sources and of the need for public assurance in creating public health information materials to address global health threats.

Within S the receptor binding domain (RBD) mediates the interaction with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the SARS-CoV host cell receptor. Both S and the RBD are highly immunogenic and both have been found to elicit neutralizing antibodies. Reported here is the X-ray crystal structure of the RBD in complex with the Fab of a neutralizing mouse monoclonal antibody, F26G19, elicited by immunization with chemically inactivated SARS-CoV. The RBD–F26G19 Fab complex represents the first example of the structural characterization of an antibody elicited by an immune response to SARS-CoV or any fragment of it. The structure reveals that the RBD surface recognized by F26G19 overlaps significantly with the surface recognized by ACE2 and, as such, suggests that F26G19 likely neutralizes SARS-CoV by blocking the virus–host cell interaction.","Pak, John E.; Sharon, Chetna; Satkunarajah, Malathy; Auperin, Thierry C.; Cameron, Cheryl M.; Kelvin, David J.; Seetharaman, Jayaraman; Cochrane, Alan; Plummer, Francis A.; Berry, Jody D.; Rini, James M.",J Mol Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19324051/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022283609003374; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2009.03.042; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283609003374,135

We studied pharmacists’ knowledge, attitude, and practice towards the COVD-19 outbreak compared with other healthcare workers during the pandemic in Saudi Arabia. METHODS: We surveyed pharmacists’ socio-demographics (n=50) compared with other healthcare professionals (n=378) during lockdown starting in June 2020. We measured respondents’ level of knowledge (n=10 questions, maximum score of 10), attitude (n=17 questions, maximum score of 80), and their practices (n=16 questions, maximum score of 80) towards COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: Median knowledge score was 8 (25th–75th percentiles: 7–9), attitude score 76 (70–80) and practice score 74 (68–78). Good knowledge predictors were >20 years working experience [OR: 2.05 (95% CI: 1.03–4.06); P=0.04] and >50% working in clinical practice [OR: 1.72 (95% CI: 1.12–2.66); P=0.01], in inverse relationship with paramedical professions [OR: 0.45 (95% CI: 0.45 (0.28–0.72)); P=0.001] and working in a university hospital [OR: 0.51 (95% CI: 0.33. 0.81); P=0.004]. Availability of pharmaceutical information and treatment options was associated with good attitude [OR: 2.19 (95% CI: 1.04–4.59); P=0.039] and acquaintance as primary information sources negatively associated with good attitude [OR: 0.34 (95% CI: 0.15–0.8); P=0.013]. Good practice predictors were female gender [OR: 3.84 (95% CI: 2.37–6.24); P<0.001], military hospital employment [OR: 2.32 (95% CI: 1.25–4.31); P=0.008], USA [OR: 3.41 (95% CI: 1.03–11.22); P=0.044] or UK [OR: 8.86 (95% CI: 1.91–41.07); P=0.005] qualifications, and information on supportive measures [OR: 2.2 (95% CI: 1.36–3.56); P=0.001].

615876,N-terminal Domain of the Spike Protein of Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus as a New Candidate Molecule for a Mucosal Vaccine,2018-06-15,"BACKGROUND: To date, over 2 million people worldwide have died with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. To describe the experience in Ireland, this study examined associations between underlying conditions and the following outcomes: mortality, admission to hospital or admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) among those infected with COVID-19. METHODS: This study used data from the Health Protection Surveillance Centre in Ireland and included confirmed cases of COVID-19 from the first wave of the pandemic between March and July 2020. Two cohorts were included: all cases (community and hospital) and hospital admissions only. For all cases, health outcome data included mortality and hospitalisation. For hospitalised cases, outcome data included mortality and ICU admission. Logistic regression was used to examine associations between underlying conditions and outcomes across both cohorts. Results are presented as adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). FINDINGS: There were 19,789 cases included in analysis, which encompassed 1,476 (7.5%) deaths, 2,811 (14.2%) hospitalisations, and 438 (2.2%) ICU admissions of whom 90 (20.5%) died. Significantly higher risk of mortality, hospitalisation and ICU admission was associated with having chronic heart disease, a BMI ≥40kg/m(2) and male sex. Additionally, diagnosis of a chronic neurological condition (OR 1.41; 95%CI:1.17, 1.69), chronic kidney disease (OR 1.74; 95%CI:1.35, 2.24) and cancer (OR 2.77; 95%CI:2.21, 3.47) were significantly associated with higher risk of mortality among all cases, with similar patterns of association observed for mortality among hospitalised cases. INTERPRETATION: The identification of underlying conditions among COVID-19 cases may help identify those at highest risk of the worst health outcomes and inform preventive strategies to improve outcomes. FUNDING: This study was supported by the Health Service Executive, Health Protection Surveillance Centre. KEB and MM are funded by the Health Research Board (RL-15-1579 and EIA-2019-012 respectively).","Bennett, Kathleen E.; Mullooly, Maeve; O'Loughlin, Mark; Fitzgerald, Margaret; O'Donnell, Joan; O'Connor, Lois; Oza, Ajay; Cuddihy, John",Lancet Reg Health Eur,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lanepe.2021.100097; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33880459/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2666776221000740; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666776221000740,135

As a result, many researchers have sought to find the most efficient and appropriate methods to detect and treat the SARS-CoV-2 virus over the past few months. Real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing is currently used as one of the most reliable methods to detect the new virus; however, this method is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and requires trained laboratory workers. Moreover, despite its high sensitivity and specificity, false negatives are reported, especially in non-nasopharyngeal swab samples that yield lower viral loads. Therefore, designing and employing faster and more reliable methods seems necessary. In recent years, many attempts have been made to fabricate various nanomaterial-based biosensors to detect viruses and bacteria in clinical samples. The use of nanomaterials plays a significant role in improving the performance of biosensors. Plasmonic biosensors, field-effect transistor (FET)-based biosensors, electrochemical biosensors, and reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) methods are only some of the effective ways to detect viruses. However, to use these biosensors to detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus, modifications must be performed to increase sensitivity and speed of testing due to the rapidly spreading nature of SARS-CoV-2, which requires an early point of care detection and treatment for pandemic control. Several studies have been carried out to show the nanomaterial-based biosensors’ performance and success in detecting the novel virus. The limit of detection, accuracy, selectivity, and detection speed are some vital features that should be considered during the design of the SARS-CoV-2 biosensors. This review summarizes various nanomaterials-based sensor platforms to detect the SARS-CoV-2, and their design, advantages, and limitations.","Pishva, Parsa; Yüce, Meral",Emergent Mater,https://doi.org/10.1007/s42247-021-00184-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33615139/,135

Methods: We conducted a prospective, consecutive, observational study of adult patients from a tertiary referral center with confirmed COVID-19. All patients were screened daily for neurological and neuropsychiatric symptoms during admission, at discharge and at 3-month follow-up. We classified complications as caused by SARS-CoV-2 neurotropism, immune-mediated or critical illness-related. Results: From April-September 2020, we enrolled 61 consecutively admitted COVID-19 patients, 35 (57%) of whom were referred to ICU for respiratory failure. Evaluation revealed a higher frequency of CNS/PNS symptoms in ICU patients compared to non-ICU patients. The most common CNS complication was encephalopathy (n=22, 36.1%), which was severe in 13 patients (GCS[≤]12), including 8 with akinetic mutism. Length of ICU admission was an independent predictor of encephalopathy (OR=1.23). Other CNS complications included ischemic stroke, a biopsy-proven acute necrotizing encephalitis, and transverse myelitis. The most common PNS complication was critical illness polyneuromyopathy (13.1%), with prolonged ICU stay as independent predictor (OR=1.14). Treatment-related PNS complications included meralgia paresthetica. Of 41 complications in total, 3 were classified as para/post-infectious. The remainder included cases secondary to critical illness or other causes (n=34) or without sufficient investigations (n=4). Cerebrospinal fluid was negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in all 5 patients investigated. Conclusions: CNS/PNS complications were common in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, particularly in ICU patients, and often attributable to critical illness. In cases with COVID-19 as the primary cause for neurological disease, there were no signs of viral neurotropism, but laboratory changes suggested autoimmune-mediated mechanisms.","Nersesjan, V.; Amiri, M.; Lebech, A.-M.; Roed, C.; Mens, H.; Russell, L.; Fonsmark, L.; Berntsen, M.; Sigurdsson, S.

Without having antibacterial/antiviral activities, the current masks act only as filtering materials of the aerosols containing microorganisms. Meanwhile, in surgical masks, the viral and bacterial filtration highly depends on the electrostatic charges of masks. These electrostatic charges disappear after 8 h, which leads to a significant decline in filtration efficiency. Therefore, to enhance the masks’ protection performance, fabrication of innovative masks with more advanced functions is in urgent demand. This review summarizes the various functionalizing agents which can endow four important functions in the masks including i) boosting the antimicrobial and self‐disinfectant characteristics via incorporating metal nanoparticles or photosensitizers, ii) increasing the self‐cleaning by inserting superhydrophobic materials such as graphenes and alkyl silanes, iii) creating photo/electrothermal properties by forming graphene and metal thin films within the masks, and iv) incorporating triboelectric nanogenerators among the friction layers of masks to stabilize the electrostatic charges and facilitating the recharging of masks. The strategies for creating these properties toward the functionalized masks are discussed in detail. The effectiveness and limitation of each method in generating the desired properties are well‐explained along with addressing the prospects for the future development of masks.","Seidi, Farzad; Deng, Chao; Zhong, Yajie; Liu, Yuqian; Huang, Yang; Li, Chengcheng; Xiao, Huining",Small,https://doi.org/10.1002/smll.202102453; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34319644/,135

We aimed to use a multimorbidity index developed specifically for COVID-19 to investigate the association between multimorbidity and risk of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods We used data from the UK Biobank linked to laboratory confirmed test results for SARS-CoV-2 infection and mortality data from Public Health England between March 16 and July 26, 2020. By reviewing the current literature on COVID-19 we derived a multimorbidity index including: 1) angina; 2) asthma; 3) atrial fibrillation; 4) cancer; 5) chronic kidney disease; 6) chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; 7) diabetes mellitus; 8) heart failure; 9) hypertension; 10) myocardial infarction; 11) peripheral vascular disease; 12) stroke. Adjusted logistic regression models were used to assess the association between multimorbidity and risk of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection (hospitalisation or death). Potential effect modifiers of the association were assessed: age, sex, ethnicity, deprivation, smoking status, body mass index, air pollution, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, cardiorespiratory fitness, high sensitivity C-reactive protein. Results Among 360,283 participants, the median age was 68 [range, 48-85] years, most were White (94.5%), and 1,706 had severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. The prevalence of multimorbidity was more than double in those with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection (25%) compared to those without (11%), and clusters of several multimorbidities were more common in those with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. The most common clusters with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection were stroke with hypertension (79% of those with stroke had hypertension); diabetes and hypertension (72%); and chronic kidney disease and hypertension (68%). Multimorbidity was independently associated with a greater risk of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection (adjusted odds ratio 1.91 [95% confidence interval 1.70, 2.15] compared to no multimorbidity). The risk remained consistent across potential effect modifiers, except for greater risk among men. Conclusion The risk of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection is higher in individuals with multimorbidity, indicating the need to target research and resources in people with SARS-CoV-2 infection and multimorbidity.","Chudasama, Y.

VCP was shown to affect trafficking of Sindbis virus receptor and functions as a component of Semliki Forest virus (SFV) replicase compartment. However, the role of this cellular protein was not evaluated during replication of alphaviruses including chikungunya virus (CHIKV). Using siRNA, chemical inhibitors, and trans-replication assays, we show here that VCP is a proviral factor involved in the replication of CHIKV. Immunofluorescence assays confirmed that VCP co-localized with non-structural replicase proteins but not with dsRNA foci possibly due to VCP epitope unavailability. VCP pro-viral role is also observed with other alphaviruses such as o’nyong’nyong virus (ONNV) and SFV in different human cell lines. VCP proviral roles on several viral families now extend to replication of alphaviruses CHIKV and ONNV, emphasizing the pivotal role of VCP in virus–host interaction biology.","Carissimo, Guillaume; Chan, Yi-Hao; Utt, Age; Chua, Tze-Kwang; Bakar, Farhana Abu; Merits, Andres; Ng, Lisa F.

622474,Analysis of the swine tracheobronchial lymph node transcriptomic response to infection with a Chinese highly pathogenic strain of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus,2012-10-30,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE AND AIM OF THE STUDY: Tripterygium wilfordii (lei gong teng; Thunder of God Vine), a member of the Celastraceae family, is a medicinal plant used to treat a range of illnesses. Celastrol is a quinone methide triterpene and the most abundant bioactive constituent isolated from the root extracts of T. wilfordii. Previous studies have shown that celastrol exhibits antiviral activity against HIV and SARS-CoV. To date, no investigations of the anti-DENV activity of celastrol have been reported. This work aimed to investigate the anti-DENV effect and possible mechanism of celastrol in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: A four-serotype DENV infection system was performed to determine the anti-DENV effect of celastrol by detecting DENV RNA replication and protein synthesis. The precise anti-DENV replication mechanism of celastrol was clarified using specific RNA silencing and specific inhibitor. In addition, the therapeutic efficacy of celastrol was evaluated by monitoring survival rates and clinical scores in a DENV-infected Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) suckling mouse model. RESULTS: Celastrol inhibited DENV-1, -2, -3, and -4 RNA replication with EC(50) values of 0.19 ± 0.09, 0.12 ± 0.11, 0.16 ± 0.14, and 0.17 ± 0.08 μM, respectively. This antiviral effect of celastrol was associated with celastrol-induced interferon-α (IFN-α) expression and was attenuated by a specific inhibitor of the JAK–STAT signaling pathway downstream of IFN-α or specific shRNA. Furthermore, celastrol protected ICR suckling mice against life-threatening DENV infection. CONCLUSION: Celastrol represents a potential anti-DENV agent that induces IFN-α expression and stimulates a downstream antiviral response, making the therapy a promising drug or dietary supplement for the treatment of DENV-infected patients.","Yu, Jung-Sheng; Tseng, Chin-Kai; Lin, Chun-Kuang; Hsu, Yao-Chin; Wu, Yu-Hsuan; Hsieh, Ching-Liang; Lee, Jin-Ching",Antiviral Res,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354216304351; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2016.11.010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27847245/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354216304351,135

It is a hypothetical gene, which was speculated to encode a 38 aa protein. This hypothetical protein does not share sequence similarity with any other known protein and cannot be associated with a function. While the role of this ORF10 was proposed, there is growing evidence showing that the ORF10 is not a coding region. Here, we identified SARS-CoV-2 variants in which the ORF10 gene was prematurely terminated. The disease was not attenuated, and the transmissibility between humans was maintained. Also, in vitro, the strains replicated similarly to the related viruses with the intact ORF10. Altogether, based on clinical observation and laboratory analyses, it appears that the ORF10 protein is not essential in humans. This observation further proves that the ORF10 should not be treated as the protein-coding gene, and the genome annotations should be amended.","Pancer, Katarzyna; Milewska, Aleksandra; Owczarek, Katarzyna; Dabrowska, Agnieszka; Kowalski, Michał; Łabaj, Paweł P.; Branicki, Wojciech; Sanak, Marek; Pyrc, Krzysztof",PLoS Pathog,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1008959; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33301543/,135

The current study explored these effects in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic after relaxation of governmental measures. An online survey was administered among a representative sample of the Dutch population (n = 1519) in June 2020, ten weeks after the peak of COVID-19 had passed, and five weeks after restrictions were relaxed. Participants were asked about mental health, adverse events during COVID-19, and about any positive effects of the pandemic. Most participants (80%, n = 1207) reported no change in mental health since the COVID-19 pandemic. This was also the case among respondents who had experienced an adverse event. Protective factors of mental health were being male and high levels of positive mental well-being. Risk factors were emotional loneliness and the experience of adverse life events. Social loneliness was positively associated with stable mental health, stressing the importance of meaningful relationships. Note that 58% of participants reported positive effects of the pandemic, the most common of which were rest, working from home, and feeling more socially connected. In summary, 10 weeks after the start of the crisis, and 5 weeks after relaxation of the restrictions, most people remained stable during the crisis, and were even able to report positive effects.","Gijzen, Mandy; Shields-Zeeman, Laura; Kleinjan, Marloes; Kroon, Hans; van der Roest, Henriëtte; Bolier, Linda; Smit, Filip; de Beurs, Derek",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17239073; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33291765/,135

627720,Neutralization of genotype 2 porcine epidemic diarrhea virus strains by a novel monoclonal antibody,2017-07-31,"BACKGROUND: New York City was the first major urban center of the COVID-19 pandemic in the USA. Cases are clustered in the city, with certain neighborhoods experiencing more cases than others. We investigate whether potential socioeconomic factors can explain between-neighborhood variation in the COVID-19 test positivity rate. METHODS: Data were collected from 177 Zip Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTA) in New York City (99.9% of the population). We fit multiple Bayesian Besag-York-Mollié (BYM) mixed models using positive COVID-19 tests as the outcome, a set of 11 representative demographic, economic, and health-care associated ZCTA-level parameters as potential predictors, and the total number of COVID-19 tests as the exposure. The BYM model includes both spatial and nonspatial random effects to account for clustering and overdispersion. RESULTS: Multiple regression approaches indicated a consistent, statistically significant association between detected COVID-19 cases and dependent children (under 18 years old), population density, median household income, and race. In the final model, we found that an increase of only 5% in young population is associated with a 2.3% increase in COVID-19 positivity rate (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.4 to 4.2%, p=0.021). An increase of 10,000 people per km(2) is associated with a 2.4% (95% CI 0.6 to 4.2%, p=0.011) increase in positivity rate. A decrease of $10,000 median household income is associated with a 1.6% (95% CI 0.7 to 2.4%, p<0.001) increase in COVID-19 positivity rate. With respect to race, a decrease of 10% in White population is associated with a 1.8% (95% CI 0.8 to 2.8%, p<0.001) increase in positivity rate, while an increase of 10% in Black population is associated with a 1.1% (95% CI 0.3 to 1.8%, p<0.001) increase in positivity rate. The percentage of Hispanic (p=0.718), Asian (p=0.966), or Other (p=0.588) populations were not statistically significant factors. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate associations between neighborhoods with a large dependent youth population, densely populated, low-income, and predominantly black neighborhoods and COVID-19 test positivity rate. The study highlights the importance of public health management during and after the current COVID-19 pandemic. Further work is warranted to fully understand the mechanisms by which these factors may have affected the positivity rate, either in terms of the true number of cases or access to testing.","Whittle, Richard S.; Diaz-Artiles, Ana",BMC Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32883276/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12916-020-01731-6,135

628155,"Role of CD151, A tetraspanin, in porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus infection",2007-06-16,"BACKGROUND: The context of coronavirus on higher education caused upsetting consequences on students’ lives. The restrictions on social mobility and the consequent reduction of interpersonal contacts brought them unprecedented stressful situations. The extent and quality of adaptation to these situations, due to the uniqueness of each person's resources, needs to be early known preventing eventual and serious psychological disorders. This study aimed to assess stress, anxiety, and depression among undergraduate students from both Santarém and Leiria Polytechnic Institutes. METHODS: A descriptive cross-sectional correlational study was performed in the period immediately after the first lockdown. Participants were 775 students (females = 73.5%), aged between 17 and 55 years. All of them completed measures of the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21; in the Portuguese version EADS, by Pais-Ribeiro, Honrado e Leal, 2004). Collected data were analyzed with IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows software, Version 27.0. RESULTS: According to DASS-21 scoring instructions (Lovibond & Lovibond, 1995), results showed that most participants had experienced a normal level of depression (72.5%), anxiety (79.7%) and stress (87.6%). However, about 4.7% and 1.8% of respondents, respectively, report a severe or extremely severe level of anxiety or depression. We also found significant differences for the three dimensions in terms of polytechnic institute attended, gender, age categories, and marital status. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that higher education institutions must understand this phenomenon experienced and develop strategies for improving students' mental health, especially in vulnerable groups. The importance of a transdisciplinary approach is emphasized and the involvement of all educational stakeholders is encouraged.","Silva, Mário; Gonzaga, Luís; Figueiredo, Maria do Carmo; Rosa, Marta; Matos, Rui; Amendoeira, José",Eur J Public Health,https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckab120.094,135
628830,Comparison of four regions in the replicase gene of heterologous infectious bronchitis virus strains,2004-06-20,"Background Many individuals infected SARS-COV2 never develop significant symptoms. With 24 million Americans already infected and highly transmissible variants rapidly emerging, it is highly probable that post- and pre-symptomatic individuals will form a significant fraction of those seeking dental care. Salivary carriage rates in these populations are not known. Moreover, although preventing transmission is critical for controlling spread, the efficacy of mouthrinses in reducing oral viral load is poorly studied.background Methods 201 asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic, post-symptomatic and symptomatic individuals were recruited and copy numbers of SARS-CoV2 measured in unstimulated saliva using real-time reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR. 41 symptomatic individuals were subsequently inducted into a randomized, triple-blinded study and instructed to rinse with saline, 1% hydrogen peroxide, 0.12% chlorhexidine or 0.5% povidone-iodine for sixty seconds. Viral load was measured 15- and 45-minutes post-rinsing. Results Salivary SARS-CoV2 was detected in 23% of asymptomatic, 60% of post-symptomatic and 28% of pre-symptomatic individuals. Neither carriage rate nor viral load correlated with COVID symptomatology, age, gender or ethnicity. All four mouthrinses decreased viral load by 61-89% at 15 minutes, and by 70-97% at 45 minutes. The extent of reduction correlated significantly with initial viral load.results Conclusions Non-symptomatic individuals can pose a risk for viral transmission, and mouthrinses are simple and efficacious means of reducing this risk, especially when the load is <104 copies/ml.conclusion Practical Implications At a time when resources are stretched, our findings contribute to evidence-based selection of personal protection equipment and simple infection control practices to reduce contagion at source.","Chaudhary, Prem Prashant; Melkonyan, Arsen; Meethil, Archana; Saraswat, Shweta; Hall, David L.; Cottle, James; Wenzel, Mark; Ayouty, Nadine; Bense, Spenser; Casanova, Fabiola; Chaney, Matthew; Chase, Hannah; Hermel, Rebecca; McClement, Matthew; Sesson, Claire; Woolsey, Bryce; Kumar, Purnima",J Am Dent Assoc,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S000281772100355X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34561086/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.adaj.2021.05.021; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000281772100355X?v=s5,135

STUDY DESIGN: The hospital data of 235 patients infected with COVID-19 were analyzed. RESULTS: Based on CDC criteria, among our study patients, 74% had severe COVID-19 infection and 32.8% were vitamin D sufficient. After adjusting for confounding factors, there was a significant association between vitamin D sufficiency and reduction in clinical severity, inpatient mortality serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and an increase in lymphocyte percentage. Only 9.7% of patients older than 40 years who were vitamin D sufficient succumbed to the infection compared to 20% who had a circulating level of 25(OH)D< 30 ng/ml. The significant reduction in serum CRP, an inflammatory marker, along with increased lymphocytes percentage suggest that vitamin D sufficiency also may help modulate the immune response possibly by reducing risk for cytokine storm in response to this viral infection. CONCLUSION: Therefore, it is recommended that improving vitamin D status in the general population and in particular hospitalized patients has a potential benefit in reducing the severity of morbidities and mortality associated with acquiring COVID-19.","Maghbooli, Zhila; Sahraian, Mohammad Ali; Ebrahimi, Mehdi; Pazoki, Marzieh; Kafan, Samira; Tabriz, Hedieh Moradi; Hadadi, Azar; Montazeri, Mahnaz; Nasiri, Mehrad; Shirvani, Arash; Holick, Michael F.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32976513/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0239799,135

This study aimed to determine whether non‐replicating FMDV could induce apoptosis of the host immune cells. In this study, we have demonstrated that bone morrow derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) were induced to undergo apoptosis in a dose‐dependent manner, which was determined by the annexin‐V staining, DNA fragmentation, and TUNEL staining methods, after they were treated with the chemically inactivated FMDV in vitro. The initiation of apoptosis was apparently via an interaction of the integrin receptor on BMDCs and the RGD motif within the VP1 capsid protein of FMDV. The initiation activated a cascade of apoptotic pathway including reduced expression of Bcl‐2, activation of caspases, and release of cytochrome c from mitochondria. Pretreatment with BMDCs with LPS prevented the inactivated FMDV induced apoptosis, suggesting immature BMDCs are susceptible to such apoptosis. Taken together, the data demonstrate that the inactivated FMDV induces the apoptosis in BMDCs via the integrin receptor and subsequently triggers the apoptosis signal, suggesting that such induction of apoptosis is likely to impair immune responses against FMDV infection.

Because of the critical role played by serological assays for SARS diagnosis, an in‐house ELISA based on SARS‐CoV recombinant antigens was developed. The SARS‐CoV nucleocapsid protein (N), three N fragments (N1, N2, and N3) and the intraviral domain of the membrane protein (M2) were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli as histidine‐tagged proteins. Six reference sera from SARS patients were used to detect virus‐specific IgG in an ELISA using each recombinant protein as coating antigen. High‐titre positive reactions were detected in all SARS positive sera. The specificity of the assay appears to be high as no positive reaction was detected in the sera of 20 healthy subjects and 73 patients with non‐SARS, low‐tract respiratory infections. Specific hyper‐immune sera to SARS‐CoV and the recombinant proteins, N, N1, N2, N3, and M2 were also generated in mice and rabbits. The specificity of these sera was confirmed by an immunocytochemical assay on biochips of SARS‐CoV infected and uninfected cells. J. Med.

The large scale explosion of the disease is conventionally traced back to January of this year in the Chinese province of Hubei, the wet markets of the principal city of Wuhan being assumed to have been the specific causative locus of the sudden explosion of the infection. A number of findings that are now coming to light show that this interpretation of the origin and history of the pandemic is overly simplified. A number of variants of the coronavirus would in principle have had the ability to initiate the pandemic well before January of this year. However, even if the COVID-19 had become, so to say, ready, conditions in the local environment would have had to prevail to induce the loss of the biodiversity’s “dilution effect” that kept the virus under control, favoring its spillover from its bat reservoir to the human target. In the absence of these appropriate conditions only abortive attempts to initiate the pandemic could possibly occur: a number of them did indeed occur in China, and probably elsewhere as well. These conditions were unfortunately present at the wet marked in Wuhan at the end of last year.","Platto, Sara; Xue, Tongtong; Carafoli, Ernesto",Cell Death Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32973152/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41419-020-02995-9,135

This may be observed in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and also in patients with coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), that is a pandemic characterized by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) needing mechanical ventilation and intensive care unit treatment. However, the type and rate of thrombosis can vary according to the cause of pneumonia as is more frequently complicated by arterial thrombosis in CAP, while an equal incidence of venous and arterial thrombosis occurs in SARS-CoV-2. The mechanisms of disease are overall platelet-related in CAP while activation of both platelets and clotting system is implicated in the pathogenesis of thrombosis in SARS-CoV-2; this finding could imply a different therapeutic approach of the two settings. Thrombosis may also occur in subjects vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 even if its incidence is not so high (1/100 000); this rare effect occurs more prevalently in young women, is independent from known risk factors of thrombosis, is caused by antibodies against platelet PF4 and is counteracted by treatment with immunoglobulin and glucocorticoids.","Violi, Francesco; Cammisotto, Vittoria; Pastori, Daniele; Pignatelli, Pasquale",Eur Heart J Suppl,https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/suab118; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34650382/,135

In the present study, we further study the role of long-lasting neurodegeneration on the development of neurogenic bladder dysfunction in mice with corona-virus induced encephalitis (CIE). Long-term follow up study revealed three phenotypes of neurodegenerative symptom development: recovery (REC group), chronic progression (C-PRO group) and chronic disease with relapsing-remitting episodes (C-RELAP group). The levels of IL-1β in REC group, IL-10 in C-RELAP group, and IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-α in C-PRO group were diminished in the brain. The levels of TNF-α in REC group and INF-γ, IL-2, TGF-β and TNF-α in the C-PRO group were also diminished in the urinary bladder. Mice in C-RELAP group showed a delayed recovery of voiding function. In vitro contractility studies determined a decreased basal detrusor tone and reduced amplitude of nerve-mediated contractions in C-RELAP group, whereas C-PRO group had elevated muscle-mediated contractions.

However, the definitive diagnosis of feline cardiac disease by echocardiography is limited in some areas. This study was designed to determine the indicators from fluid analysis obtained from pleural effusion to help diagnose cardiac disease in cats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted. Data of 61 cats with pleural effusion were retrieved. The cats were divided into two groups: Cardiac disease (n=34) and non-cardiac disease (n=27) groups. Sex, neuter status, breed, age, weight, physical findings, fluid analysis results, radiographic findings, echocardiographic findings, and the presence of other diseases or conditions were recorded. RESULTS: The Chi-square test showed the relationship between cardiac disease and the presence of abnormal heart sounds (p=0.0003), the N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide-positive result from serum samples (p=0.046), the presence of arterial thromboembolism (p<0.00001), and the presence of radiographic evidence of cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema (p=0.0002 and 0.001, respectively). The Mann–Whitney U-test showed a significant difference in protein concentration and specific gravity between the cardiac and non-cardiac disease groups (p=0.012 and 0.009, respectively). The decision tree classification method showed that protein concentrations of ≤3 g/dL were related to cardiac disease (sensitivity, 41.2% and specificity, 92.6%). CONCLUSION: The protein concentration in the pleural fluid may be used to distinguish cardiac and non-cardiac diseases in cats.","Chobsuk, Nutcha; Pongprasit, Panita; Puangploy, Pralphun; Bunnag, Monnakarn; Keerativitayanant, Luksika; Surachetpong, Sirilak Disatian",Vet World,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34566344/; https://doi.org/10.14202/vetworld.2021.2238-2243,135
641534,Characterization and analysis of an infectious bronchitis virus strain isolated from southern China in 2013,2016-03-09,"BACKGROUND: Many studies suggest that patient satisfaction is significantly negatively correlated with the waiting time. A well-designed healthcare system should not keep patients waiting too long for an appointment and consultation. However, in China, patients spend notable time waiting, and the actual time spent on diagnosis and treatment in the consulting room is comparatively less. METHODS: We developed an artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted module and name it XIAO YI. It could help outpatients automatically order imaging examinations or laboratory tests based on their chief complaints. Thus, outpatients could get examined or tested before they went to see the doctor. People who saw the doctor in the traditional way were allocated to the conventional group, and those who used XIAO YI were assigned to the AI-assisted group. We conducted a retrospective cohort study from August 1, 2019 to January 31, 2020. Propensity score matching was used to balance the confounding factor between the two groups. And waiting time was defined as the time from registration to preparation for laboratory tests or imaging examinations. The total cost included the registration fee, test fee, examination fee, and drug fee. We used Wilcoxon rank-sum test to compare the differences in time and cost. The statistical significance level was set at 0.05 for two sides. RESULTS: Twelve thousand and three hundred forty-two visits were recruited, consisting of 6171 visits in the conventional group and 6171 visits in the AI-assisted group. The median waiting time was 0.38 (interquartile range: 0.20, 1.33) hours for the AI-assisted group compared with 1.97 (0.76, 3.48) hours for the conventional group (p < 0.05). The total cost was 335.97 (interquartile range: 244.80, 437.60) CNY (Chinese Yuan) for the AI-assisted group and 364.58 (249.70, 497.76) CNY for the conventional group (p < 0.05).

This study explored the perceptions and experiences of cigar-smoking cessation and assistance received from healthcare providers among forty Black young-adult cigar smokers (ages 21–29). Semi-structured in-depth phone interviews were transcribed and coded. Qualitative data were analyzed by using thematic analysis. Participants mostly smoked cigarillos, large cigars, and blunts. Overall, many regular cigarillo smokers reported interest in quitting eventually, while large-cigar and blunt smokers shared less interest in quitting because they perceived low harm from smoking these products. The reasons for cigar-smoking cessation were health concerns and financial constraints. Most of the participants who attempted to quit cigars did not use any cessation aids. The reasons for relapse included nicotine withdrawal, stress, and easy access. Additionally, most participants reported their healthcare providers did not ask whether they smoked cigars, and even when they knew, little assistance for cigar-smoking cessation was provided. Informing Black cigar smokers of the harm of cigar smoking and encouraging healthcare providers to screen for and assist with cigar-smoking cessation may alleviate the health burden of cigar smoking in this population.","Ajith, Aniruddh; Broun, Aaron; Duarte, Danielle A.; Jewett, Bambi; Phan, Lilianna; Mead-Morse, Erin L.; Guy, Mignonne C.; Choi, Kelvin; Chen-Sankey, Julia",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18147309; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34299759/,135

Methods Viruses from cell culture materials or clinical specimens were identified following an improved NGS procedure: reduction of background noise by sample preprocessing, viral enrichment by barcoded oligonucleotide (random hexamer or non-ribosomal hexanucleotide) primer-based amplification, fragmentation-free library construction and sequencing of one-tube mixtures, as well as rapid data analysis using an in-house pipeline. Results NGS data demonstrated that both barcoded primer sets were useful to simultaneously capture multiple viral pathogens in cell culture materials or clinical specimens and verified that hexanucleotide primers captured as many viral sequences as hexamers did. Moreover, direct testing of clinical specimens using this improved hexanucleotide primer-based NGS approach provided further detailed genotypes of enteroviruses causing hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) and identified other potential viruses or differentiated misdiagnosis events. Conclusion The improved barcoded oligonucleotide primer-based NGS approach is simplified, time saving, cost effective, and appropriate for direct identification of viral pathogens in clinical practice.","WANG, Chun Hua; NIE, Kai; ZHANG, Yi; WANG, Ji; ZHOU, Shuai Feng; LI, Xin Na; ZHOU, Hang Yu; QI, Shun Xiang; MA, Xue Jun",Biomedical and Environmental Sciences,https://doi.org/10.3967/bes2017.003; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0895398817300156; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0895398817300156; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28245896/,135

Risk factors include septicemia, dehydration, polycythemia, maternal diabetes, asphyxia, and inherited thrombophilias. They present with cyanosis and respiratory distress. Careful echocardiogram assessment helps in identifying the thrombus in the pulmonary artery and its branches. Computed tomography pulmonary angiography confirms the diagnosis. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a case of term neonate who presented with respiratory distress and cyanosis and a detailed echocardiogram revealed thrombus in the origin of left pulmonary artery. The neonate was managed initially with unfractionated heparin and later with low molecular weight heparin with which there was significant resolution of the thrombus CONCLUSION: Spontaneous pulmonary artery thrombosis though rare should be suspected in any cyanotic neonate with respiratory distress. Management in these cases depends on the haemodynamic instability and lung ischemia.","Shrimanth, Y. S.; Prasad, Krishna; Karhtik, Adari Appala; Barwad, Parag; Pruthvi, C.

648346,Effect of temperature and relative humidity on ultraviolet (UV(254)) inactivation of airborne porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus,2012-09-14,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Global malaria elimination has little chance of success without an effective vaccine. The first malaria vaccine, RTS,S/AS01e, demonstrated moderate efficacy against clinical malaria in phase III trials and is undergoing large-scale effectiveness trials in Africa. Importantly, the vaccine did not perform equally well between phase III study sites. Though reasons for the moderate efficacy and this variation are unclear, various mechanisms have been suggested. This review summarizes the recent literature on such mechanisms, with a focus on those involving landscape ecology, parasite antigenic variation, and human host genetic differences. RECENT FINDINGS: Transmission intensity may have a role pre- and post-vaccination in modulating immune responses to the vaccine. Furthermore, malaria incidence may “rebound” in vaccinated populations living in high transmission intensity settings. There is growing evidence that both genetic variation in the parasite circumsporozoite protein and variation of human host genetic factors affect RTS,S vaccine efficacy. These genetic factors may be interacting in complex ways to produce variation in the natural and vaccine-induced immune responses that protect against malaria. SUMMARY: Due to the modest efficacy of RTS,S/AS01e, the combinations of factors (ecological, parasite, human host) impacting its effectiveness must be clearly understood, as this information will be critical for implementation policy and future vaccine designs.","Bell, Griffin J.; Agnandji, Selidji Todagbe; Asante, Kwaku Poku; Ghansah, Anita; Kamthunzi, Portia; Emch, Michael; Bailey, Jeffrey A.",Curr Epidemiol Rep,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40471-021-00271-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34367877/,135

Recent data suggests a high concentration of SARS-Cov2 receptors, ACE2 or TMPRSS2, in nasal epithelium and cornea, which explains person-to-person transmission. We investigated the prevalence of SARS-CoV2 receptors among reproductive tissues by exploring the single-cell sequencing datasets from uterus, myometrium, ovary, fallopian tube, and breast epithelium. We did not detect significant expression of either ACE2 or TMPRSS2 in the normal human myometrium, uterus, ovaries, fallopian tube, or breast. Furthermore, none of the cell types in the female reproductive organs we investigated, showed the co-expression of ACE2 with proteases, TMPRSS2, Cathepsin B (CTSB), and Cathepsin L (CTSL) known to facilitate the entry of SARS2-CoV2 into the host cell. These results suggest that myometrium, uterus, ovaries, fallopian tube, and breast are unlikely to be susceptible to infection by SARS-CoV2.","Goad, Jyoti; Rudolph, Joshua; Rajkovic, Aleksandar",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0243959; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33315943/,135

650265,Aminopeptidase-N-independent entry of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus into Vero or porcine small intestine epithelial cells,2018-03-02,"Small interfering RNA (siRNA) is a class of duplex RNA molecules of 21-25 nt nucleotides in length functioning post-transcriptionally to downregulate targeted gene expression. The membrane (M) protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is highly abundant during viral infections and is a critical element for viral assembly. Nucleotide substitution in the viral genome occurs frequently during SARS-CoV infection. In the current study, we analyzed the M gene sequences derived from 15 SARS-CoV isolates and uncovered six nucleotide substitutions among these isolates. Interestingly, these nucleotide substitutions are all located at the 5’ half of the M gene. Based on this information and previous reports, we created two novel siRNAs targeting two unexplored and well conserved regions in the M gene. The effects of these two siRNAs were tested by semi-quantitative RT-PCR and EGFP-M fusion gene expression. The results demonstrated that both siRNAs effectively and specifically blocked the targeted gene expression. Real time quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) revealed that siRNA targeting the 3’ half of the M gene (si-M2) induced more potent inhibition than that targeting the 5’ half (si-M1). Both si-M1 and si-M2 significantly downregulated M gene mediated upregulation of interferon β expression. Thus, our results indicate that SARS-CoV M gene specific siRNA might function in a sequence-dependent manner.","Wang, Ying; Cao, Ying-Li; Yang, Fan; Zhang, Yun; Wang, Shu-Hui; Liu, Li",Molecules,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20956884/; https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules15107197,135

Observation : Le cas clinique rapporté concerne un patient de 20 ans sans comorbidités, atteint d’une infection sévère à la COVID-19 compliquée d’un Syndrome de Détresse Respiratoire Aigüe, avec manifestations thromboemboliques et surinfection bactérienne. Ce patient souffrait également d'un trouble neurologique non spécifique lié au SARS-Cov-2 avec une paralysie pseudobulbaire (IRM, ENMG et ponction lombaire étaient normaux), associé à des troubles neurologiques persistants 4 mois plus tard, caractérisés par un déficit à prédominance motrice de l'épaule gauche et une insuffisance respiratoire. Le bilan respiratoire et neurologique conclut à un syndrome de Parsonage-Turner, ou amyotrophie névralgique, affectant les racines nerveuses en C5-C6, le nerf pectoral latéral et le nerf phrénique à l'origine de l'amyotrophie de la ceinture scapulaire et de la paralysie du diaphragme gauche. Conclusion : Ce cas montre que la dyspnée persistante après une infection à la COVID-19 doit faire rechercher une cause diaphragmatique et que celle-ci n’est pas toujours secondaire à la neuropathie de réanimation, mais peut aussi être le témoin d’une amyotrophie névralgique. Introduction: Complications following COVID-19 are starting to emerge; neurological disorders are already described in the literature. Case report: This case is about a 20-year old male with a severe COVID-19, hospitalized in a Reanimation and Intensive Care Unit with an Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, thromboembolic complication and secondary bacterial infection. This patient had a non-specific neurological disorder with a pseudobulbar palsy, (MRI, ENMG and lumbar puncture were normal), associated 4 months later with persistent left shoulder motor deficit and respiratory failure. Respiratory and neurological check-up led to a diagnosis of the Parsonage-Turner syndrome or neuralgic amyotrophy affecting C5-C6 nerve roots, the lateral pectoral and phrenic nerves at the origin of the scapular belt, amyotrophy and left diaphragm paralysis. Conclusions: This case shows that persistant dyspnoea after COVID 19 infection should lead to a search for a diaphragmatic cause which is not always the result of Reanimation Neuropathy but may also indicate a neuralgic amyotrophy. It is the fourth case of neuralgic amyotrophy following COVID-19. This brings the medical community to consider the risk of diaphragm paralysis apart from critical illness polyneuropathy. Respiratory muscle evaluation and diaphragmatic ultrasound should be considered in case of persistent dyspnoea.","Viatge, T.; Noel-Savina, E.; Prevot, G.; Faviez, G.; Plat, G.; De Boissezon, X.; Cintas, P.; Didier, A.",Rev Mal Respir,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0761842521003065; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0761842521003065?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34325956/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rmr.2021.06.004,135

As well as in a clinical context, also in a medico-legal setting the diagnosis of sepsis can reveal challenging due to the unspecificity of the signs detected during autopsies, especially when no ante-mortem clinical data, laboratory, and cultural results are available. Thus, a systematic review of literature was performed to provide an overview of the main available and updated forensic tools for the post-mortem diagnosis of sepsis. Moreover, the aim of this review was to evaluate whether a marker or a combination of markers exist, specific enough to allow a correct and definite post-mortem diagnosis. The review was conducted searching in PubMed and Scopus databases, and using variable combinations of the keywords “post mortem sepsis diagnosis”, “macroscopic signs”, “morphology”, “histology”, “immunohistochemical markers”, “biochemical markers”, and “forensic microbiology”. The article selection was carried out following specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. A total of 44 works was identified, providing data on morphological aspects of the organs examined, histological findings, immunohistochemical and biochemical markers, and cultural assays. The review findings suggested that the post-mortem diagnosis of sepsis can be achieved by a combination of data obtained from macroscopic and microscopic analysis and microbial investigations, associated with the increased levels of at least two of three biochemical and/or immunohistochemical markers evaluated simultaneously on blood samples.","Stassi, Chiara; Mondello, Cristina; Baldino, Gennaro; Ventura Spagnolo, Elvira",Diagnostics (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33092081/; https://doi.org/10.3390/diagnostics10100849,135

Coagulation cascade and platelet functions have not been well studied in the COVID-19 patients. METHODS: A total of 178 patients enrolled in Wuhan Huoshenshan Hospital were included for the study. Blood platelets and coagulation functions were analyzed in COVID-19 patients with non-severe and severe subgroups. Other biochemical laboratory parameters were also analyzed. RESULTS: Forty-nine (27.5%) out of 178 patients were diagnosed with severe disease in this study, and 129 patients with non-severe disease. Severe disease group had significant lower platelet count 186.00 (103.50–249.00) ×10(9)/L than 251.00 (202.00–317.00) ×10(9)/L of non-severe group, p = 0.000.

Survival rate of severe disease group was worse than non-severe group, 85.7% vs. 100%, p = 0.000. Thrombocytopenia correlated with coagulation function, DIC rate and survival. Six out of 7 death case had thrombocytopenia during hospitalization, and platelet count decreased subsequently until death. Thrombocytopenia occurred within 1 week after admission in 6 recovered patients. And increased platelet levels followed by positive SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG and negative coronavirus nucleic acid tested in 8 recovered patients.

652223,"Epigallocatechin-3-Gallate, the Main Polyphenol in Green Tea, Inhibits Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus In Vitro",2021-02-22,"INTRODUCTION: Partnerships are essential to creating effective global health leadership training programs. Global pandemics, including the HIV/AIDS pandemic, and more recently the COVID-19 pandemic, have tested the impact and stability of healthcare systems. Partnerships must be fostered to prepare the next generation of leaders to collaborate effectively and improve health globally. OBJECTIVES: We provide key matrices that predict success of partnerships in building global health leadership capacity. We highlight opportunities and challenges to building effective partnerships and provide recommendations to promote development of equitable and mutually beneficial partnerships. FINDINGS: Critical elements for effective partnership when building global health leadership capacity include shared strategic vision, transparency and excellent communication, as well as intentional monitoring and evaluation of the partnership, not just the project or program. There must be recognition that partnerships can be unpredictable and unequal, especially if the end is not defined early on. Threats to equitable and effective partnerships include funding and co-funding disparities between partners from high-income and low-income countries, inequalities, unshared vision and priorities, skewed decision-making levels, and limited flexibility to minimize inequalities and make changes. Further, imbalances in power, privilege, position, income levels, and institutional resources create opportunities for exploitation of partners, particularly those in low-income countries, which widens the disparities and limits success and sustainability of partnerships. These challenges to effective partnering create the need for objective documentation of disparities at all stages, with key milestones to assess success and the environment to sustain the partnerships and their respective goals. CONCLUSIONS: Developing effective and sustainable partnerships requires a commitment to equality from the start by all partners and an understanding that there will be challenges that could derail otherwise well-intended partnerships. Guidelines and training on evaluation of partnerships exist and should be used, including generic indicators of equity, mutual benefit, and the added value of partnering. KEY TAKEAWAYS: Effective partnerships in building global health leadership capacity require shared strategic vision and intentional monitoring and evaluation of goals. Inequalities in partnerships may arise from disparities in infrastructure, managerial expertise, administrative and leadership capacity, as well as limited mutual benefit and mutual respect. To promote equitable and effective partnerships, it is critical to highlight and monitor key measures for success of partnerships at the beginning of each partnership and regularly through the lifetime of the partnership. We recommend that partnerships should have legal and financial laws through executed memoranda of understanding, to promote accountability and facilitate objective monitoring and evaluation of the partnership itself. More research is needed to understand better the contextual predictors of the broader influence and sustainability of partnership networks in global health leadership training.","Nakanjako, Damalie; Kendall, Diane; Sewankambo, Nelson K.; Razak, Myat Htoo; Oduor, Bonface; Odero, Theresa; Garcia, Patricia; Farquhar, Carey",Annals of global health,https://doi.org/10.5334/aogh.3214; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34307069/,135

653726,Deoxynivalenol Promotes Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus Infection and Aggravates Gut Barrier Injury,2019-11-22,"Background: Several recent studies support the notion of excessive complement activation in patients with severe coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), with beneficial results of complement inhibition in case series. In this context, severe COVID-19 shares common characteristics with complement-mediated thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). TMA is commonly characterized by genetic susceptibility, and presents with thrombocytopenia, anemia, increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and organ damage (renal, neurological, cardiac). Aims: We hypothesized that genetic susceptibility would be also evident in patients with severe COVID-19 and would be associated with disease severity. Methods: We prospectively studied consecutive adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in our referral centers (April-May 2020). Diagnosis was confirmed by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). COVID-19 severity was assessed based on World Health Organization's (WHO) criteria into moderate/severe, and critical disease. Additional data on patients' history and course were recorded by treating physicians that followed patients up to discharge or death. Patients' DNA was obtained from peripheral blood samples. Probes were designed using the Design studio (Illumina). Amplicons cover exonic regions of TMA-associated genes (Complement factor H/CFH, CFH-related, CFI, CFB, CFD, C3, CD55, C5, MCP, thombomodulin/THBD, ADAMTS13) spanning 15 bases into the intronic regions. We used 10ng of initial DNA material. Libraries were quantified using Qubit and sequenced on a MiniSeq System in a 2x150 bp run. Analysis was performed using the TruSeq Amplicon application (BaseSpace). Alignment was based on the banded Smith-Waterman algorithm in the targeted regions (specified in a manifest file). We performed variant calling with the Illumina-developed Somatic Variant Caller in germline mode and variant allele frequency higher than 20%. Both Ensembl and Refseq were used for annotation of the output files. Variants clinical significance was based on ClinVar and the current version of the Complement Database, as we have previously described. Results: We studied 60 patients, 40 with moderate/severe disease hospitalized in COVID-19 general ward (GW) and 20 with critical disease hospitalized in intensive care units (ICU). Among them, 11 patients succumbed due to COVID-19 disease. Patients laboratory characteristics are shown in Figure. In genetic analysis, patients presented heterogeneous variant profiles including pathogenic, benign, likely benign, and variants of unknown significance (median number of variants: 62, range: 51-89). Search in the Complement Database revealed seven patients, each carrying one pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant in C3, CD46, DGKE, and CFH. Based on ClinVar, we found a pathogenic variant of ADAMTS13 (rs2301612, missense) in 28 patients. We also detected two missense risk factor variants, previously detected in complement-related diseases: rs2230199 in C3 (13 patients); and rs800292 in CFH (26 patients). Among them, 22 patients had a combination of these characterized variants. This combination was significantly associated with critical disease that required intensive care (p=0.037), as well as low lymphocyte counts (p=0.021) and high neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (p=0.050). In the multivariate model, critical disease was an independent predictor of double heterozygocity in these variants. Furthermore, one patient had a rare germline missense variant in CFI (rs112534524), previously detected in complement-related diseases. This patient suffered from critical disease but survived after long-term ICU hospitalization. Interestingly, five patients showed a likely protective missense variant in CFB (rs641153). Conclusion: We have detected for the first time rare and pathogenic TMA-associated variants in patients with severe COVID-19. Our findings of variants in complement-regulatory genes and ADAMTS13 suggest genetic susceptibility and define proof-of-concept for proper selection of patients that would benefit from complement inhibition.

METHODS: In this study 12 obese adolescents aged 14–18 years were offered a targeted group-specific sports program including a home exercise program of 8 weeks. The group leaders were trained in the SDT and supported to integrate motivational aspects. A SDT-based questionnaire by Kohake and Lehnert was used to evaluate motivational interventions. RESULTS: In total, seven (58%) patients finished the study. In the before-after comparison there were little changes in motivation. Results showed that contrary to expectations the motivation of the obese adolescents to move and to participate in the study was generally high. In the study, more internalized forms of motivation dominated, the highest quality form of motivation. CONCLUSION: Digital technologies could be a successful way to further increase motivation and compliance of our target group.

In addition, STAT3 plays a key role in regulating host immune and inflammatory responses and in the pathogenesis of many cancers. Several studies reported differential regulation of STAT3 in a range of viral infections. Interestingly, STAT3 appears to direct seemingly contradictory responses and both pro- and antiviral roles of STAT3 have been described. This review summarized the currently known functions of STAT3 in the regulation of viral replication and pathogenesis of viral infections. Some of the key unanswered questions and the gap in our current understanding of the role of STAT3 in viral pathogenesis are discussed.","Kuchipudi, Suresh V.",J Immunol Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26199948/; https://doi.org/10.1155/2015/272359,135

660314,Contribution of the porcine aminopeptidase N (CD13) receptor density to porcine epidemic diarrhea virus infection,2010-07-29,"Introduction: Severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic has spread from Wuhan, China in December, 2019 to 216 countries and territories as of September 10, 2020 with 27.74 million cases and 899,911 confirmed deaths. The spectrum of disease is most commonly seen as a viral pneumonia with high grade fevers, shortness of breath, dry cough, and chest pain with radiologic evidence of bilateral, interstitial, ground glass opacities, and peripheral lung consolidation. Liver chemistries are frequently abnormal, with transaminases shown to be one-two times the upper limit of normal in most instances. The full spectrum of gastrointestinal involvement of the SARS-CoV-2 infection has yet to be fully seen. Patient concerns: We present a case of a young woman with SLE who developed severe abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, rapidly progressing to acute hepatic failure and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. She had no respiratory symptoms. Diagnosis: A thorough work-up of acute liver failure including liver biopsy confirmed acute hepatitis with viral like changes. Common viral causes of liver failure were ruled out. The patient had no recent travel history. Interventions: The patient was started on hydroxychloroquine due to SLE, treated with N-Acetyl-Cysteine, and methylprednisolone. Outcomes: The patient improved with resolution of encephalopathy and normalization of her liver chemistries without any development of respiratory illness. Conclusion: This case details a unique presentation of likely SARS-CoV-2 infection. Until now, the literature has primarily described a respiratory illness and liver injury with mild transaminase elevations. Significant liver injury progressing to acute liver failure should be considered in those with SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Melquist, Stephanie; Estepp, Kayla; Aleksandrovich, Yauheni; Lee, Angela; Beiseker, Andrea; Hamedani, Farid Saei; Bassett, John",Medicine (Baltimore),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33120805/; https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000022818,135
660368,Molecular Characterization of Major Structural Protein Genes of Avian Coronavirus Infectious Bronchitis Virus Isolates in Southern China,2013-12-04,"The novel coronavirus is not only causing respiratory problems, but it may also damage the heart, kidneys, liver, and other organs; in Wuhan, 14 to 30% of COVID-19 patients have lost their kidney function and now require either dialysis or kidney transplants. The novel coronavirus gains entry into humans by targeting the ACE2 receptor that found on lung cells, which destroy human lungs through cytokine storms, and this leads to hyperinflammation, forcing the immune cells to destroy healthy cells. This is why some COVID-19 patients need intensive care. The inflammatory chemicals released during COVID-19 infection cause the liver to produce proteins that defend the body from infections. However, these proteins can cause blood clotting, which can clog blood vessels in the heart and other organs; as a result, the organs are deprived of oxygen and nutrients which could ultimately lead to multiorgan failure and consequent progression to acute lung injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and often death. However, there are novel protein modification tools called the QTY code, which are similar in their structure to antibodies, which could provide a solution to excess cytokines. These synthetic proteins can be injected into the body to bind the excess cytokines created by the cytokine storm; this will eventually remove the excessive cytokines and inhibit the severe symptoms caused by the COVID-19 infection. In this review, we will focus on cytokine storm in COVID-19 patients, their impact on the body organs, and the potential treatment by QTY code-designed detergent-free chemokine receptors.","Mustafa, Mujahed I.; Abdelmoneim, Abdelrahman H.; Mahmoud, Eiman M.; Makhawi, Abdelrafie M.",Mediators Inflamm,https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/8198963; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33029105/,135

Thus, there is an unmet clinical need for a non-invasive and reliable test to differentiate between malignant and benign breast lesions in order to avoid subjecting patients with abnormal mammograms to unnecessary follow-up diagnostic procedures. Serum samples from 116 malignant breast lesions and 64 benign breast lesions were comprehensively profiled for 2,083 microRNAs (miRNAs) using next-generation sequencing. Of the 180 samples profiled, three outliers were removed based on the principal component analysis (PCA), and the remaining samples were divided into training (n = 125) and test (n = 52) sets at a 70:30 ratio for further analysis. In the training set, significantly differentially expressed miRNAs (adjusted p < 0.01) were identified after correcting for multiple testing using a false discovery rate. Subsequently, a predictive classification model using an eight-miRNA signature and a Bayesian logistic regression algorithm was developed. Based on the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis in the test set, the model could achieve an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.9542. Together, this study demonstrates the potential use of circulating miRNAs as an adjunct test to stratify breast lesions in patients with abnormal screening mammograms.","Loke, Sau Yeen; Munusamy, Prabhakaran; Koh, Geok Ling; Chan, Claire Hian Tzer; Madhukumar, Preetha; Thung, Jee Liang; Tan, Kiat Tee Benita; Ong, Kong Wee; Yong, Wei Sean; Sim, Yirong; Oey, Chung Lie; Lim, Sue Zann; Chan, Mun Yew Patrick; Ho, Teng Swan Juliana; Khoo, Boon Kheng James; Wong, Su Lin Jill; Thng, Choon Hua; Chong, Bee Kiang; Tan, Ern Yu; Tan, Veronique Kiak-Mien; Lee, Ann Siew Gek",Cancers (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31769433/; https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers11121872,135
662352,"Identification, Expression, and Processing of an 87-kDa Polypeptide Encoded by ORF 1a of the Coronavirus Infectious Bronchitis Virus",1995-04-01,"BACKGROUND: Social science models find the ecological impacts of climate change (EICC) contribute to internal migration in developing countries and, less so, international migration. Projections expect massive climate-related migration in this century. Nascent research calls to study health, migration, population, and armed conflict potential together, accounting for EICC and other factors. System science offers a way: develop a dynamic simulation model (DSM). We aim to validate the feasibility and usefulness of a pilot DSM intended to serve as a proof-of-concept and a basis for identifying model extensions to make it less simplified and more realistic. METHODS: Studies have separately examined essential parts. Our DSM integrates their results and computes composites of health problems (HP), health care (HC), non-EICC environmental health problems (EP), and environmental health services (ES) by origin site and by immigrants and natives in a destination site, and conflict risk and intensity per area. The exogenous variables include composites of EICC, sociopolitical, economic, and other factors. We simulate the model for synthetic input values and conduct sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: The simulation results refer to generic origin and destination sites anywhere on Earth. The effects’ sizes are likely inaccurate from a real-world view, as our input values are synthetic. Their signs and dynamics are plausible, internally consistent, and, like the sizes, respond logically in sensitivity analyses. Climate migration may harm public health in a host area even with perfect HC/ES qualities and full access; and no HP spillovers across groups, conflict, EICC, and EP. Deviations from these conditions may worsen everyone’s health. We consider adaptation options. CONCLUSIONS: This work shows we can start developing DSMs to understand climate migration and public health by examining each case with its own inputs. Validation of our pilot model suggests we can use it as intended. We lay a path to making it more realistic for policy analysis.

662608,Molecular epidemiology and evolution of avian infectious bronchitis virus in Spain over a fourteen-year period,2008-04-25,"Highly sensitive nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) designed to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA are the standard of care for the diagnosis of COVID-19. However, the accuracy of these methods for the quantitation of active virus rather than non-infectious RNA fragments that can persist for extended periods of time has been unclear. This issue is particularly relevant for congregate care patients who are unable to return to their home residence until fully negative by NAATs. We tested paired samples from individual patients for the presence of virus at both early and later stages of disease. Culture of nasopharyngeal swab samples for 10 days in Vero E6 cells revealed active virus in only 4 out of 14 (28.6%) patients. The ability to isolate viral plaque-forming units (PFU) correlated with viral RNA loads of >6.79 log genomic copies/ml and only occurred in samples collected from patients early after symptom onset and before development of antibody. Culture in Vero E6 cells lacking the STAT1-dependent interferon signaling pathway increased the numbers of viral PFU detected but did not affect the incidence of positive cultures. We conclude that culturable virus is correlated with SARS-CoV-2 NAATs detection only during early symptom onset and with high viral titers/low antibody titers in non-immunosuppressed patients.","Singh, Amit K.; Stellrecht, Kathleen A.; Arunachalam, Thilaka; Barman, Tarani K.; Robek, Michael D.; Waxman, Michael J.; Elmendorf, Sarah L.; Metzger, Dennis W.",J Clin Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34153860/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653221001463; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653221001463?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2021.104879,135
664394,Molecular epidemiology and phylogenetic analysis of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) field isolates in Korea,2013-03-06,"Coronaviruses devote more than three quarters of their coding capacity to encode two large polyproteins (1a and 1ab polyproteins), which are proteolytically processed into 15–16 mature, nonstructural replicase proteins (nsp1 to 16). These cleavage products are believed to play essential roles in replication of the giant RNA genome of ∼ 30 kb and transcription of a nested set of 5 to 9 subgenomic RNA species by a unique discontinuous transcription mechanism. In this report, one of these replicase proteins, nsp9 of the coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is systematically studied using both biochemical and reverse genetic approaches. The results showed that substitution mutation of a conserved Gly (G98) residue in the C-terminal α-helix domain with an Asp greatly destabilized the IBV nsp9 homodimer and abolished its RNA-binding activity. Introduction of the same mutation into an infectious IBV clone system showed that the mutation totally abolishes the transcription of subgenomic RNA and no infectious virus could be recovered. Mutation of a semi-conserved Ile (I95) residue in the same region showed moderately destabilizing effect on the IBV nsp9 homodimer but minimal effect on its RNA-binding activity. Introduction of the mutation into the IBV infectious clone system showed recovery of a mutant virus with severe growth defects, supporting that dimerization is critical for the function of this replicase protein. Meanwhile, mutations of some positively charged residues in the β-barrel regions of the IBV nsp9 protein significantly reduced its RNA-binding activity, but with no obvious effect on dimerization of the protein. Introduction of these mutations into the viral genome showed only mild to moderate effects on the growth and infectivity of the rescued mutant viruses.","Chen, Bo; Fang, Shouguo; Tam, James P.; Liu, Ding Xiang",Virology,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682208007071; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682208007071; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2008.10.032; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19022466/,135

The secondary objective is to identify stress management strategies in the work environment during the pandemic time. METHODS This is an integrative review. Phase 1 consisted of a search for 2020 papers regarding mental health, work and the pandemics in free access electronic databases (MEDLINE, SCIELO, Bireme and LILACS). Phase 2 consisted of literature indicated by specialists in occupational psychiatry and positive psychology. These materials were read and critically analyzed. RESULTS As a result of the literature review, 40 references were included. The articles reviewed were divided in the following categories: articles concerning work relationships in Brazil, articles describing the impact of pandemics on mental health and work, articles focusing on the work of health professionals during pandemics, articles about well-being at work, and papers proposing strategies to improve well-being and productivity and promote mental health. DISCUSSION The Covid-19 pandemic can cause a significant impact on workers' mental health and productivity. Most professionals face the need to adapt to changes, which can decrease the feeling of well-being. Consequently, strategies to promote well-being and mental health at the work environment should be a priority.

666669,Erratum to: Immunogenicity and antigenic relationships among spike proteins of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus subtypes G1 and G2,2016-02-03,"INTRODUCTION: N95 or higher filtering respirators have been recommended in healthcare settings, although there is still a risk of infection due to the improper selection and wearing of respirators. We aimed to assess the effects of training with N95 or higher filter respirators on the protection performance of respirators among healthcare providers in the emergency medical center (EMC). METHODS: This randomized crossover study evaluated 23 healthcare providers. Quantitative fit tests (QNFTs) were performed before and after training using three types of N95 or higher filter respirators (cup-type, fold-type, valve-type). Training was performed by lecture, real-time feedback, and fit check. The primary outcome was the fit factor, and the secondary outcomes were overall fit factor, adequate protection rate, and respiratory preference. RESULTS: Fit factors, overall fit factor, and adequate protection rate were higher after training than before training for the 3 types of respirators (all P < .05). For normal breathing, fit factors before and after training were 121 (10–185) vs 192 (161–200) for cup-type, 200 (39–200) vs 200 (200–200) for fold-type, and 85 (18–157) vs 173 (117–200) for valve-type. For normal breathing, the adequate protection rates before and after training were 62 (0–100) vs 100 (90–100) for cup-type, 100 (0–100) vs 100 (100–100) for fold-type, and 19 (0–100) vs 100 (44–100) for valve-type (all P < .05). The most preferred respirator type was the valve-type (10 persons, 45.5%). CONCLUSIONS: Training on wearing an N95 or higher respirator improved the protection performance of respirators among healthcare providers working in the EMC.

Correlations between diversity, environmental parameters and land use patterns were analyzed and significant correlations were highlighted. Overall, the majority (65.5%) of the annotated virome belonged to bacteriophages. The percentage of Caudovirales was higher in reservoirs whereas the percentages of Dicistroviridae, Microviridae and Circoviridae were higher in tributaries. Reservoirs showed a higher Shannon-index virome diversity compared to upstream tributaries. Land use (urbanized, agriculture and parkland areas) influenced the characteristics of the virome distribution pattern. Dicistroviridae and Microviridae were enriched in urbanized tributaries while Mimiviridae, Phycodnaviridae, Siphoviridae and Podoviridae were enriched in parkland reservoirs. Several sequences closely related to the emerging zoonotic virus, cyclovirus, and the human-related virus (human picobirnavirus), were also detected. In addition, the relative abundance of PMMoV (pepper mild mottle virus) sequences was significantly correlated with RT-qPCR measurements (0.588 < r < 0.879, p < 0.05). This study shows that spatial factors (e.g., reservoirs/tributaries, land use) are the main drivers of the viral community structure in tropical freshwater ecosystems.","Gu, Xiaoqiong; Tay, Qi Xiang Martin; Te, Shu Harn; Saeidi, Nazanin; Goh, Shin Giek; Kushmaro, Ariel; Thompson, Janelle R.; Gin, Karina Yew-Hoong",Water Res,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2018.03.017; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0043135418302136; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0043135418302136; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29550725/,135

Prioritizing vaccine rollout, and achievement of herd immunity depend on SARS-CoV-2 transmission reduction. The vaccine's effect on infectivity is thus a critical priority. METHODS: Among all 9650 HCW of a large tertiary medical center in Israel, we calculated the prevalence of positive SARS-CoV-2 qRT-PCR cases with asymptomatic presentation, tested following known or presumed exposure and the infectious subset (N-gene-Ct-value<30) of these. Additionally, infection incidence rates were calculated for symptomatic cases and infectious (Ct<30) cases. Vaccine effectiveness within three months of vaccine rollout was measured as one minus the relative risk or rate ratio, respectively. To further assess infectiousness, we compared the mean Ct-value and the proportion of infections with a positive SARS-CoV-2 antigen test of vaccinated vs. unvaccinated. The correlation between IgG levels within the week before detection and Ct level was assessed. FINDINGS: Reduced prevalence among fully vaccinated HCW was observed for (i) infections detected due to exposure, with asymptomatic presentation (VE(i)=65.1%, 95%CI 45-79%), (ii) the presumed infectious (Ct<30) subset of these (VE(ii)=69.6%, 95%CI 43-84%) (iii) never-symptomatic infections (VE(iii)=72.3%, 95%CI 48-86%), and (iv) the presumed infectious (Ct<30) subset (VE(iv)=83.0%, 95%CI 51-94%). Incidence of (v) symptomatic and (vi) symptomatic-infectious cases was significantly lower among fully vaccinated vs. unvaccinated individuals (VE(v)= 89.7%, 95%CI 84-94%, VE(vi)=88.1%, 95%CI 80-95%). The mean Ct-value was significantly higher in vaccinated vs. unvaccinated (27.3±1.2 vs. 22.2±1.0, p<0.001) and the proportion of positive SARS-CoV-2 antigen tests was also significantly lower among vaccinated vs. unvaccinated PCR-positive HCW (80% vs. 31%, p<0.001). Lower infectivity was correlated with higher IgG concentrations (R=0.36, p=0.01). INTERPRETATION: These results suggest that BNT162b2 is moderately to highly effective in reducing infectivity, via preventing infection and through reducing viral shedding.

The clinical presentation of MIS-C includes fever, severe illness, and the involvement of two or more organ systems, in combination with laboratory evidence of inflammation and laboratory or epidemiologic evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Some features of MIS-C resemble Kawasaki Disease, toxic shock syndrome, and secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis/macrophage activation syndrome. The relationship of MIS-C to SARS-CoV-2 infection suggests that the pathogenesis involves post-infectious immune dysregulation. Patients with MIS-C should ideally be managed in a pediatric intensive care environment since rapid clinical deterioration may occur. Specific immunomodulatory therapy depends on the clinical presentation. The relationship between the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in development and MIS-C requires further study.","Nakra, Natasha A.; Blumberg, Dean A.; Herrera-Guerra, Angel; Lakshminrusimha, Satyan",Children (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/children7070069; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32630212/,135

670302,Mutations in the genome of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus responsible for the attenuation phenotype,2000,"Rolling circle-replicating plasmids constitute a vast family that is particularly abundant in, but not exclusive of, Gram-positive bacteria. These plasmids are constructed as cassettes that harbor genes involved in replication and its control, mobilization, resistance determinants and one or two origins of lagging strand synthesis. Any given plasmid may contain all, some, or just only the replication cassette. We discuss here the family of the promiscuous streptococcal plasmid pMV158, with emphasis on its mobilization functions: the product of the mobM gene, prototype of the MOB(V) relaxase family, and its cognate origin of transfer, oriT. Amongst the subfamily of MOB(V1) plasmids, three groups of oriT sequences, represented by plasmids pMV158, pT181, and p1414 were identified. In the same subfamily, we found four types of single-strand origins, namely ssoA, ssoU, ssoW, and ssoT. We found that plasmids of the rolling-circle Rep_2 family (to which pMV158 belongs) are more frequently found in Lactobacillales than in any other bacterial order, whereas Rep_1 initiators seemed to prefer hosts included in the Bacillales order. In parallel, MOB(V1) relaxases associated with Rep_2 initiators tended to cluster separately from those linked to Rep_1 plasmids. The updated inventory of MOB(V1) plasmids still contains exclusively mobilizable elements, since no genes associated with conjugative transfer (other than the relaxase) were detected. These plasmids proved to have a great plasticity at using a wide variety of conjugative apparatuses. The promiscuous recognition of non-cognate oriT sequences and the role of replication origins for lagging-strand origin in the host range of these plasmids are also discussed.","Lorenzo-Díaz, Fabián; Fernández-López, Cris; Garcillán-Barcia, M.

671151,"Complete genome sequences of novel S-deletion variants of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus identified from a recurrent outbreak on Jeju Island, South Korea",2019-07-26,"Background While public health strategies to contain the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic are primarily focused on social distancing and isolation, emerging evidence suggest that in some regions social isolation failed to lead to further decrease in the number of COVID-19 deaths in the long run. This apparent paradox was particularly observed in the northern region of Brazil, in the state of Amazonas. We hypothesized that the emergence of new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) mutations, leading to more transmissible and pathogenic variants, could explain the lack of further reductions in COVID-19 new cases and related deaths in some regions. Our objective is to determine if social isolation is associated with the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants, particularly the P.1 lineage and E484K mutants, in Brazil and in the state of Amazonas. Materials and methods We assessed the prevailing SARS-CoV-2 genomes present in Brazil available on the GISAID (Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data) database collected between June 1, 2020, and January 31, 2021. Data regarding demographics, lineage, and prevalence of P.1 lineage and E484K mutations were obtained. Social isolation was measured using the Social Isolation Index (SII), which quantifies the percentage of individuals that stayed within a distance of 450 meters from their homes on a given day, between February 1, 2020, and January 24, 2021. The number of daily COVID-19 deaths was obtained from the Brazilian Ministry of Health (OpenDataSUS, 2021) between March 12, 2020, and January 10, 2021. SII was correlated with the prevalence P.1 lineage and E484K mutations in the eight following weeks. All univariate associations were estimated using the Spearman Correlation Index. 3D surfaces were employed to reflect the relationship between time, social isolation, and prevalence of genomic variants simultaneously. Results A total of 773 and 77 samples were obtained in Brazil and in the Amazonas state, respectively. In the state of Amazonas, SII on a given week was positively, significantly, and moderately or strongly (r > 0.6) correlated with the prevalence of both P.1 lineage and other E484K variants in the six following weeks after the SII on a given week. Conversely, in overall Brazil, correlations between SII and P.1 lineage and E484K variants were weaker and shorter, or negative, respectively. When SII was below 40%, P.1 lineage or E484K variants were not detected in the following weeks. When SII was above 40%, apparently exponential positive correlations between SII and prevalence of both P.1 lineage and E484K variants were observed. Conclusion The results of this study indicate that SII above 40% is associated with the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 E484K variants and P.1 lineage in the state of Amazonas, which was not observed in overall Brazil.","Zimerman, Ricardo A; Cadegiani, Flavio A; Pereira e Costa, Rute Alves; Goren, Andy; Campello de Souza, Bruno",Cureus,https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.13819; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33728228/,135
673113,Elevated dietary zinc oxide levels do not have a substantial effect on porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PPRSV) vaccination and infection,2014-08-08,"BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis morbidity and mortality rates in China have decreased since the 2000s. Further analyses of the spatiotemporal and demographic changes occurring in the last decade and its implication on estimates of disease burden are required to inform intervention strategies. In this study, we quantified the epidemiological shift and geographical heterogeneity in the burden of leptospirosis during 2005–2015 in China. METHODS: We used reported leptospirosis case data from 1st January 2005 to 31st of December 2015 that routinely collected by the China Information System for Disease Control and Prevention (CISDCP) to analyze the epidemiological trend and estimate the burden in terms of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) over space, time, and demographical groups. RESULTS: A total of 7763 cases were reported during 2005–2015. Of which, 2403 (31%) cases were the laboratory-confirmed case. Since 2005, the notified incidence rate was gradually decreased (P < 0.05) and it was relatively stable during 2011–2015 (P > 0.05). During 2005–2015, we estimated a total of 10 313 DALYs were lost due to leptospirosis comprising a total of 1804 years-lived with disability (YLDs) and 8509 years-life lost (YLLs). Males had the highest burden of disease (7149 DALYs) compared to females (3164 DALYs). The highest burden estimate was attributed to younger individuals aged 10–19 years who lived in southern provinces of China. During 2005–2015, this age group contributed to approximately 3078 DALYs corresponding to 30% of the total DALYs lost in China. Yet, our analysis indicated a declining trend in burden estimates (P < 0.001) since 2005 and remained relatively low during 2011–2015. Low burden estimates have been identified in the endemic regions where infections principally distributed. Most of the changes in DALY estimates were driven by changes in YLLs. CONCLUSIONS: In the last 11-years, the burden estimates of leptospirosis have shown a declining trend across the country; however, leptospirosis should not be neglected as it remains an important zoonotic disease and potentially affecting the young and productive population in economically less-developed provinces in southern of China. In addition, while in the last five years the incidence has been reported at very low-level, this might not reflect the true incidence of leptospirosis. Strengthened surveillance in the endemic regions is, hence, substantially required to capture the actual prevalence to better control leptospirosis in China.

Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) deeply characterize the genetic diversity among rapidly mutating virus populations at the interspecific as well as the intraspecific level. The diversity of RNA viruses present in faeces of neonatal piglets suffering from diarrhoea in 47 farms, plus 4 samples from non-diarrhoeic piglets has been evaluated by NGS. Samples were selected among the cases submitted to the Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratories of Infectious Diseases of the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona (Barcelona, Spain) and Universidad de León (León, Spain). RESULTS: The analyses identified the presence of 12 virus species corresponding to 8 genera of RNA viruses. Most samples were co-infected by several viruses. Kobuvirus and Rotavirus were more commonly reported, with Sapovirus, Astrovirus 3, 4 and 5, Enterovirus G, Porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus, Pasivirus and Posavirus being less frequently detected. Most sequences showed a low identity with the sequences deposited in GenBank, allowing us to propose several new VP4 and VP7 genotypes for Rotavirus B and Rotavirus C. CONCLUSIONS: Among the cases analysed, Rotaviruses were the main aetiological agents of diarrhoea in neonate pigs. Besides, in a small number of cases Kobuvirus and Sapovirus may also have an aetiological role. Even most animals were co-infected in early life, the association with enteric disease among the other examined viruses was unclear. The NGS method applied successfully characterized the RNA virome present in faeces and detected a high level of unreported intraspecific diversity.","Cortey, Martí; Díaz, Ivan; Vidal, Anna; Martín-Valls, Gerard; Franzo, Giovanni; Gómez de Nova, Pedro José; Darwich, Laila; Puente, Héctor; Carvajal, Ana; Martín, Marga; Mateu, Enric",BMC Vet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31805938/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-019-2204-2,135

It emerges that a country’s trajectory during an initial first month “priming period” largely determines how the situation unfolds subsequently. We also propose a method for forecasting case counts, which takes advantage of the common, latent information in the entire sample of curves, instead of just the history of a single country. Our framework facilitates to quantify the effects of demographic covariates and social mobility on doubling rates and case fatality rates through a time-varying regression model. Decreased workplace mobility is associated with lower doubling rates with a roughly 2 week delay, and case fatality rates exhibit a positive feedback pattern.","Carroll, Cody; Bhattacharjee, Satarupa; Chen, Yaqing; Dubey, Paromita; Fan, Jianing; Gajardo, Álvaro; Zhou, Xiner; Müller, Hans-Georg; Wang, Jane-Ling",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33273598/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-77709-4,135

In March, the disease was declared a ”global pandemic” by the World Health Organization (WHO). Until now, there is no known vaccine or drug, since the unknown things related to the disease are more important than our theoretical and empirical knowledge. However, mathematical modeling and the estimation of the basic number of reproductions can provide clarifications in order to determine the potential and severity of this epidemic and therefore provide essential information to identify the type of measures and interventions to be taken to control the intensity of the spread of the disease. Hence, in this paper, we propose a new deterministic compartmental model based on the clinical progression of the disease, the epidemiological state of the individuals and the intervention for the dynamics of COVID-19 infections. Our approach consists of seven phenotypes: the susceptible humans, exposed humans, infectious humans, the recovered humans, the quarantine population, there recovered-exposed and deceased population. We proved first through mathematical approach the positivity, boundness and existence of a solution to the considered model. We also studied the existence of the disease free equilibrium and corresponding stability. Our work shows, in particular, that the disease will decrease if the number of reproduction R(0) was less than one. Moreover, the impact of the quarantine strategies to reduce the spread of this disease is discussed. The theoretical results are validated by some numerical simulations of the system of the epidemic’s differential equations. It should be mentioned that, the error between the considered model and the official data curve is quite small.","Fredj, Haifa Ben; Chrif, Farouk",Chaos Solitons Fractals,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960077920303684?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chaos.2020.109969; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0960077920303684; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32536761/,135

Currently there is a paucity of information regarding the nature of the immune response to viral infections in bats, partly due to a lack of appropriate bat specific reagents. IFNγ plays a key role in controlling viral replication and coordinating a response for long term control of viral infection. Here we describe the cloning and expression of IFNγ from the Australian flying fox, Pteropus alecto and the generation of mouse monoclonal and chicken egg yolk antibodies specific to bat IFNγ. Our results demonstrate that P. alecto IFNγ is conserved with IFNγ from other species and is induced in bat splenocytes following stimulation with T cell mitogens. P. alecto IFNγ has antiviral activity on Semliki forest virus in cell lines from P. alecto and the microbat, Tadarida brasiliensis. Additionally recombinant bat IFNγ was able to mitigate Hendra virus infection in P. alecto cells. These results provide the first evidence for an antiviral role for bat IFNγ in vitro in addition to the application of important immunological reagents for further studies of bat antiviral immunity.","Janardhana, Vijaya; Tachedjian, Mary; Crameri, Gary; Cowled, Chris; Wang, Lin-Fa; Baker, Michelle L.",Dev Comp Immunol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dci.2011.11.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22093696/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0145305X11003004; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0145305X11003004,135

We report an outbreak that occurred from October 2020 to February 2021 in eastern Senegal, notified and managed through the synergistic effort yellow fever national surveillance implemented by the Senegalese Ministry of Health in collaboration with the World Health Organization, the countrywide 4S network set up by the Ministry of Health, the Institut Pasteur de Dakar, and the surveillance of arboviruses and hemorrhagic fever viruses in human and vector populations implemented since mid 2020 in eastern Senegal. Virological analyses highlighted the implication of sylvatic mosquito species in virus transmission. Genomic analysis showed a close relationship between the circulating strain in eastern Senegal, 2020, and another one from the West African lineage previously detected and sequenced two years ago from an unvaccinated Dutch traveler who visited the Gambia and Senegal before developing signs after returning to Europe. Moreover, genome analysis identified a 6-nucleotide deletion in the variable domain of the 3′UTR with potential impact on the biology of the viral strain that merits further investigations. Integrated surveillance of yellow fever virus but also of other arboviruses of public health interest is crucial in an ecosystem such as eastern Senegal.","Diagne, Moussa Moïse; Ndione, Marie Henriette Dior; Gaye, Alioune; Barry, Mamadou Aliou; Diallo, Diawo; Diallo, Amadou; Mwakibete, Lusajo L.; Diop, Mamadou; Ndiaye, El Hadji; Ahyong, Vida; Diouf, Babacar; Mhamadi, Moufid; Diagne, Cheikh Tidiane; Danfakha, Fodé; Diop, Boly; Faye, Oumar; Loucoubar, Cheikh; Fall, Gamou; Tato, Cristina M.; Sall, Amadou Alpha; Weaver, Scott C.; Diallo, Mawlouth; Faye, Ousmane",Viruses,https://doi.org/10.3390/v13081475; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34452343/,135
679450,The S2 Subunit of Infectious Bronchitis Virus Beaudette Is a Determinant of Cellular Tropism,2018-09-12,"OBJECTIVE: This study investigated clinicians’ perspectives on the feasibility and effectiveness of using telemedicine in the context of providing first aid. It is crucial to identify and explore clinicians’ attitudes and awareness of tele-first-aid in China to keep pace with ongoing global trends. DESIGN: This was a qualitative study. Data gathered from in-depth interviews with 22 clinicians were coded into themes and analyzed. PARTICIPANTS: Participants included hospital-based clinicians: four clinical specialists, eight emergency nurses, four emergency doctors, three general practitioners, and three clinical administrators. SETTING: The study was conducted in university-affiliated hospitals. RESULTS: All clinicians who were invited to participate believed that the use of telemedicine in first aid was promising and effective. Participants stated that relevant technology should be designed to synergize the chain of existing platforms in the industry and that it should be determined who has the authority to utilize such technology and how it should be used to achieve the sought-after benefits. The use of such technology refreshes the role of clinicians and their relationship with patients. Additionally, participants believed that the government could play an important role especially in the reform of medical systems. CONCLUSION: Telemedicine can facilitate the provision of conventional first aid and systematically exploit existing resources due to its feasibility and effectiveness. The social benefits of using tele-first-aid in clinical and community applications, especially when used in coordination with existing resources, make its adoption an inevitable trend in the field.","Fang, Xiaoqun; Jia, Shulei; Wang, Qiuyan; Liu, Hui-fang; Zhou, Yumei; Zhang, Lingling; Dai, Tanghua; Luo, Hui; Peng, Hui; Yuan, Jun; Zhou, Huyan",Int J Gen Med,https://doi.org/10.2147/ijgm.s314901; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34285559/,135

AIM: This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of scoring systems such as emergency department triage early warning score (TREWS) and modified early warning score (MEWS) in predicting mortality in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, PCR positive patients evaluated for COVID-19 and decided to be hospitalized were evaluated. During the first evaluation, MEWS and TREWS scores of the patients were calculated. Intensive care needs as well as 24-h and 28-day mortality rates were evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 339 patients were included in the study. While 30 (8.8%) patients were hospitalized in the intensive care unit, 4 (1.2%) died in the emergency. The number of patients who died within 28 days was found to be 57 (16.8%). In 24-h mortality, the median MEWS value was found to be 7 (IQR 25–75) while the TREWS value was 11.5 (IQR 25–75). In the ROC analysis made for the diagnostic value of 28-day mortality of MEWS and TREWS scores, the area under the curve (AUC) for the MEWS score was found to be 0.833 (95% CI 0.777–0.888, p < 0.001) while it was identified as 0.823 (95% CI 0.764–0.882, p < 0.001) for the TREWS.

Here, we studied 489 SARS-CoV-2 genomes obtained from 32 countries from the Nextstrain database and performed phylogenetic tree analysis by clade, country, and genotype of the surface spike glycoprotein (S protein) at site 614. We found that virus strains from mainland China were mostly distributed in Clade B and Clade undefined in the phylogenetic tree, with very few found in Clade A. In contrast, Clades A2 (one case) and A2a (112 cases) predominantly contained strains from European regions. Moreover, Clades A2 and A2a differed significantly from those of mainland China in age of infected population (P = 0.0071, mean age 40.24 to 46.66), although such differences did not exist between the US and mainland China. Further analysis demonstrated that the variation of the S protein at site 614 (QHD43416.1: p.614D>G) was a characteristic of stains in Clades A2 and A2a. Importantly, this variation was predicted to have neutral or benign effects on the function of the S protein. In addition, global quality estimates and 3D protein structures tended to be different between the two S proteins. In summary, we identified different genomic epidemiology among SARS-CoV-2 strains in different clades, especially in an amino acid variation of the S protein at 614, revealing potential viral genome divergence in SARS-CoV-2 strains.","Cao, Canhui; Huang, Liang; Liu, Kui; Ma, Ke; Tian, Yuan; Qin, Yu; Sun, Haiyin; Ding, Wencheng; Gui, Lingli; Wu, Peng",Genes Dis,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2352304220300714; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32837981/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gendis.2020.05.006; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352304220300714?v=s5,135

Here we report results from the fifth round of observations for swabs collected from the 18th September to 5th October 2020. This report updates and should be read alongside our round 5 interim report. Methods Representative samples of the population aged 5 years and over in England with sample size ranging from 120,000 to 175,000 people at each round. Prevalence of PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, estimation of reproduction number (R) and time trends between and within rounds using exponential growth or decay models. Results 175,000 volunteers tested across England between 18th September and 5th October. Findings show a national prevalence of 0.60% (95% confidence interval 0.55%, 0.71%) and doubling of the virus every 29 (17, 84) days in England corresponding to an estimated national R of 1.16 (1.05, 1.27). These results correspond to 1 in 170 people currently swab-positive for the virus and approximately 45,000 new infections each day. At regional level, the highest prevalence is in the North West, Yorkshire and The Humber and the North East with strongest regional growth in North West, Yorkshire and The Humber and West Midlands. Conclusion Rapid growth has led to high prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 virus in England, with highest rates in the North of England.

The purpose of this study was to examine levels of well-being and mood and their relations with physical (in)activity and eating behaviors in adolescents during a lockdown period in Greece. A total of 950 adolescents (Mean Age = 14.41 years ± 1.63) participated in a web-based survey while education was conducted online and organized sport activities were interrupted. Participants showed poor well-being, insufficient physical activity levels and moderate scores of healthy eating behavior. Hierarchical regression analysis showed that, after controlling for the effect of gender and body mass index, increased physical activity and healthier eating behavior predicted better well-being (b = 0.24, p < 0.01 and b = 0.19, p < 0.01, respectively), whereas sedentariness predicted worse well-being (b = −0.16, p < 0.01). Furthermore, it was revealed that days of physical activity per week was a stronger predictor of well-being than minutes of physical activity per week, and that both in-house and out-of-house physical activity were beneficial. Considering that well-being in our study was below the threshold recommended by the World Health Organization as indicative of possible depressive symptoms, measures to increase physical activity, decrease sedentariness and improve eating behavior should become a priority for communities and policy makers.","Morres, Ioannis D.; Galanis, Evangelos; Hatzigeorgiadis, Antonis; Androutsos, Odysseas; Theodorakis, Yannis",Nutrients,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33923341/; https://doi.org/10.3390/nu13051449,135

The resultant morbidity and mortality of public and healthcare professionals has led to psychological impacts and economic repercussions. We set out to assess the concerns of doctors in training during this crisis. METHODS: A questionnaire was developed and delivered via Survey Monkey to doctors in training from 27 March to 6 April 2020, 2 weeks prior to the expected surge in Ireland and UK. The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) was incorporated to gauge respondent stress as they prepared for the COVID19 impact. RESULTS: A total of 285 participants engaged with 197 (69%) completing all questions. Almost 86% of respondents had been trained in donning and doffing personal protective equipment (PPE), and nearly 85% felt confident in the process. Overall, most respondents felt somewhat prepared (60%) or well prepared (20%) to treat COVID19 patients. However, 42% worried that their hospital would struggle, or not cope at all; in particular, 91% highlighted the risk of running out of PPE. Family health (86%), personal health (72%), and social life (47%) topped the list of junior doctor concerns. According to the PSS, the majority of respondents (62%) had moderate stress. CONCLUSIONS: This survey is the first to measure the concerns of doctors in training in Ireland as regards the COVID19 pandemic. Worries included PPE exhaustion and personal and family health.

In settings of large numbers of patients, a risk assessment tool may guide resource allocation not only for patient care but also for maximum health care and public health benefit. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to determine whether a COVID-19 telemedicine risk assessment tool accurately predicts hospitalizations. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of a COVID-19 telemedicine home monitoring program serving health care workers and the community in Atlanta, Georgia, with enrollment from March 24 to May 26, 2020; the final call range was from March 27 to June 19, 2020. All patients were assessed by medical providers using an institutional COVID-19 risk assessment tool designating patients as Tier 1 (low risk for hospitalization), Tier 2 (intermediate risk for hospitalization), or Tier 3 (high risk for hospitalization). Patients were followed with regular telephone calls to an endpoint of improvement or hospitalization. Using survival analysis by Cox regression with days to hospitalization as the metric, we analyzed the performance of the risk tiers and explored individual patient factors associated with risk of hospitalization. RESULTS: Providers using the risk assessment rubric assigned 496 outpatients to tiers: Tier 1, 237 out of 496 (47.8%); Tier 2, 185 out of 496 (37.3%); and Tier 3, 74 out of 496 (14.9%). Subsequent hospitalizations numbered 3 out of 237 (1.3%) for Tier 1, 15 out of 185 (8.1%) for Tier 2, and 17 out of 74 (23%) for Tier 3. From a Cox regression model with age of 60 years or older, gender, and reported obesity as covariates, the adjusted hazard ratios for hospitalization using Tier 1 as reference were 3.74 (95% CI 1.06-13.27; P=.04) for Tier 2 and 10.87 (95% CI 3.09-38.27; P<.001) for Tier 3.

689936,International Turbulence and Russia,2020-06-14,"The present study delineates the interaction of a typical PRRSV1.1 isolate 3267 (moderate virulence) with in vitro derived pig conventional dendritic cells, cDC1, cDC2, and a CD14(+) population (designated as CD14(+) DCs). cDC1 and cDC2 were not susceptible to 3267 infection, but a fraction of CD14(+) DCs were infected. After exposure to the virus, all three DC types remained immature as determined by no increase of maturation molecules (MHC-I, MHC-II, CD80/86, CCR7), no release of cytokines, no modification of antigen presentation abilities, and no alteration of endocytic/phagocytic capabilities. However, when infected MARC-145 cells were used as a source of viral antigens, cDC2 and CD14(+) DCs showed a significant increase in the expression of maturation molecules and substantial release of cytokines, notably IL-12/IL-23p40 (by both DC types) and IL-10 (by CD14(+) DCs). To address the impact of PRRSV1 3267 on TLR3- and TLR7-mediated activation, cDC1, cDC2, and CD14(+) DCs were inoculated by the virus (live or UV-inactivated) for 6 h prior to or simultaneously with the addition of poly I:C (TLR3 ligand) or gardiquimod (TLR7 ligand; not used for cDC1). Compared with using TLR ligand alone, combination with the virus did not result in any alteration to the maturation markers on all DC types but changed the cytokine response to either TLR3 or TLR7 ligand. Pre-exposure of cDC2 or CD14(+) DCs to the live virus resulted in an increased production of IFN-α upon poly I:C stimulation, while pre-exposure to UV-inactivated virus tended to enhance the release of IL-10 upon gardiquimod stimulation. Simultaneous addition of the live virus and the TLR ligand either had no effect (mainly in cDC2) or impaired most of the cytokine release after gardiquimod stimulation (in CD14(+) DCs). When used as antigen presenting cells, cDC2 pre-inoculated by the live virus before addition of gardiquimod impaired the proliferation of CD4(–)CD8(–) T cells. In the case of CD14(+) DCs, pre-exposure to the live virus or simultaneously added with TLR3 or TLR7 ligand largely decreased the proliferation of CD4(–)CD8(+) and CD4(–)CD8(+) T-cell subsets. For cDC1, no significant changes were observed in cytokine responses or T-cell proliferation after poly I:C stimulation. Of note, cDC1 had a short life during in vitro culturing, for which the results obtained might be biased. Overall, exposure to PRRSV1 did not induce maturation of cDC1, cDC2, or CD14(+) DCs, but modified TLR3 and TLR7-associated responses (except for cDC1), which may affect the development of adaptive immunity during PRRSV1 infection. Moreover, the sensing of infected cells was different from that of the free virus.","Li, Yanli; Mateu, Enric",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34177915/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.674185,135

However, historically, most CV clinical trials have resulted in disappointing outcomes, despite promising signs of immunogenicity across most formulations. In the past decade, technologic advances regarding vaccine delivery platforms, tools for immunogenomic profiling and antigen/epitope selection have occurred. Consequently, the ability of CVs to induce tumor-specific and, in some cases, remarkable clinical responses have been observed in early-phase clinical trials. It is notable that the record-breaking speed of vaccine development in response to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic mainly relied on manufacturing infrastructures and technological platforms already developed for CVs. In turn, research, clinical data, and infrastructures put in place for the SARS-CoV2 pandemic can further speed CV development processes. This review outlines the main technological advancements as well as major issues to tackle in the development of CVs.

Reductions in stroke admissions have been reported, despite many expecting an increase due to the pro-thrombotic nature of 2019 novel coronavirus. Aims: To assess the impact of the pandemic and subsequent lockdown on stroke admissions and transient ischaemic attack referrals at the Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle-Upon-Tyne, and additionally on patient behaviours affecting modifiable risk factors or perspectives related to accessing healthcare. Methods: A single-centre retrospective data analysis was carried out on a “lockdown” cohort of suspected stroke patients admitted between 11 March to 26 May 2020 and a “pre-lockdown” cohort admitted in 2019. Differences in weekly admissions, weekly referrals, onset-to-presentation time and weekly thrombolysis cases were examined. Further analysis interrogated these cohorts separated by Bamford classification and stroke mimics (such as seizure/hemiplegic migraine/functional neurology). A binary-format questionnaire was separately administered to admitted patients from 15 April to 5 June 2020. Results: Significant reductions in weekly posterior circulation infarct (−43%, p = 0.017) and stroke-mimic (−47%, p < 0.001) admissions and weekly referrals diagnosed as non-transient ischaemic attack (−55%, p = 0.002) were observed in the lockdown cohort, with no differences in onset-to-presentation time. Over 25% of questionnaire respondents reported less physical activity, increased isolation and delaying their presentation due to the pandemic. Conclusions: This study provides evidence of reduced stroke-mimic and posterior circulation infarct admissions. Questionnaire findings suggest that patients need to be informed to ensure they appropriately seek medical advice. Significant communication at the stroke-primary care interface is needed to support referral pathways and management of modifiable risk factors.","Carson, Luke; Kui, Christopher; Smith, Gemma; Dixit, Anand K.",J Clin Med,https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10071357; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33806122/,135
