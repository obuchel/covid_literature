5300,5300,5300,Treatment of acute bronchitis in adults without underlying lung disease,20.970352,7.925152,1996-09-11,The results of detection and identification of Bacillus anthracis strains in loop-mediated isothermal DNA amplification (LAMP) reaction performed under optimized conditions with original primers and thermostable DNA polymerase are presented. Reproducible LAMP-based detection of chromosomal and plasmid DNA targets specific for B. anthracis strains has been demonstrated. No cross reactions with DNA from bacterial strains of other species of the B. cereus group were detected. The development of tests for anthrax-pathogen detection based on the optimized reaction of loop isothermal DNA amplification is planned. These tests will be convenient for clinical studies and field diagnostics due to the absence of requirements for sophisticated equipment.,"Shchit, I. Yu.; Ignatov, K. B.; Kudryavtseva, T.

Computed tomography images reveal that these children have abnormal inner ears in the form of a sac, with the semicircular canals missing or truncated. Little is known about how this inner ear abnormality affects central vestibular development. At present, mice with the chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 7 mutation are the most common model for studying congenital vestibular disorders, despite forming multiple diverse inner ear phenotypes and inducing abnormal cerebellar and visual system development. To identify the effects of a sac-like inner ear on central vestibular development, we have designed and implemented a new model, the anterior-posterior axis rotated otocyst (ARO) chick, which forms a sac-like inner ear in 85% of cases. The ARO chick is produced by anterior-posterior rotation of the otocyst at embryonic day 2. Here, we describe for the first time the 15% of ARO chicks that form three small semicircular canals and rename the ARO chicks forming sacs (ARO/s chicks). The basic features of the vestibular sensory organs in ARO/s chicks are similar to those found in patients’ sacs, and ARO/s hatchlings experience balance and walking problems like patients. Thus, ARO/s chicks have a reproducible inner ear phenotype without abnormalities in vestibular-related structures, making the model a relatively simple one to evaluate the relationship between the sac-like inner ear pathology and formation of the central vestibular neural circuitry. Here, we describe unpublished details on the surgical approaches to produce ARO chicks, including pitfalls and difficulties to avoid. NEW & NOTEWORTHY This paper describes simple techniques for chick otocyst rotation resulting in a sac-like inner ear (85%), the common phenotype in congenital vestibular disorders. We now describe anterior-posterior axis rotated otocyst chicks, which form three small canals (15%), and rename chicks forming a sac (ARO/s chicks). Basic protocols and potential complications of otocyst rotation are described. With the use of ARO/s chicks, it will be possible to determine how the vestibular neural circuit is modified by sac-like inner ear formation.","Seal, Hayley E.; Lilian, Sigmund J.; Popratiloff, Anastas; Hirsch, June C.; Peusner, Kenna D.",J Neurophysiol,479,22

However, there are limited records on the exploration of novel biomarkers for seminoma. Hence, we aimed to identify new biomarkers associated with overall survival in seminoma. mRNA-seq and clinical traits of TGCTs were downloaded from UCSC XENA and analyzed by weighted gene co-expression network analysis. After intersection with differentially expressed genes in GSE8607, common genes were subjected to protein-protein interaction (PPI) network construction and enrichment analyses. Then, the top 10 common genes were investigated by Kaplan–Meier (KM) survival analyses and univariate Cox regression analyses. Ultimately, TYROBP, CD68, and ITGAM were considered three prognostic biomarkers in seminoma. Based on correlation analysis between these genes and immune infiltrates, we suggest that the three biomarkers influence the survival of seminoma patients, possibly through regulating the infiltration of immune cells. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that TYROBP, CD68, and ITGAM could be regarded as prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for seminoma patients.","Chen, Hualin; Chen, Gang; Pan, Yang; Jin, Xiaoxiang",PLoS One,479,12

We sequenced Zika virus (ZIKV) from a rhesus macaque fetus that died after inoculation and identified a single intrahost substitution, M1404I, in the ZIKV polyprotein, located in nonstructural protein 2B (NS2B). Targeted sequencing flanking position 1404 in 9 additional macaque mothers and their fetuses identified M1404I at a subconsensus frequency in the majority (5 of 9, 56%) of animals and some of their fetuses. Despite its repeated presence in pregnant macaques, M1404I has occurred rarely in humans since 2015. Since the primary ZIKV transmission cycle is human-mosquito-human, mutations in one host must be retained in the alternate host to be perpetuated. We hypothesized that ZIKV I1404 increases viral fitness in nonpregnant macaques and pregnant mice but is less efficiently transmitted by vectors, explaining its low frequency in humans during outbreaks. By examining competitive fitness relative to that of ZIKV M1404, we observed that ZIKV I1404 produced lower viremias in nonpregnant macaques and was a weaker competitor in tissues. In pregnant wild-type mice, ZIKV I1404 increased the magnitude and rate of placental infection and conferred fetal infection, in contrast to ZIKV M1404, which was not detected in fetuses. Although infection and dissemination rates were not different, Aedes aegypti mosquitoes transmitted ZIKV I1404 more poorly than ZIKV M1404. Our data highlight the complexity of arbovirus mutation-fitness dynamics and suggest that intrahost ZIKV mutations capable of augmenting fitness in pregnant vertebrates may not necessarily spread efficiently via mosquitoes during epidemics. IMPORTANCE Although Zika virus infection of pregnant women can result in congenital Zika syndrome, the factors that cause the syndrome in some but not all infected mothers are still unclear. We identified a mutation that was present in some ZIKV genomes in experimentally inoculated pregnant rhesus macaques and their fetuses. Although we did not find an association between the presence of the mutation and fetal death, we performed additional studies with ZIKV with the mutation in nonpregnant macaques, pregnant mice, and mosquitoes. We observed that the mutation increased the ability of the virus to infect mouse fetuses but decreased its capacity to produce high levels of virus in the blood of nonpregnant macaques and to be transmitted by mosquitoes. This study shows that mutations in mosquito-borne viruses like ZIKV that increase fitness in pregnant vertebrates may not spread in outbreaks when they compromise transmission via mosquitoes and fitness in nonpregnant hosts.","Lemos, Danilo; Stuart, Jackson B.; Louie, William; Singapuri, Anil; Ramírez, Ana L.; Watanabe, Jennifer; Usachenko, Jodie; Keesler, Rebekah I.; Sanchez-San Martin, Claudia; Li, Tony; Martyn, Calla; Oliveira, Glenn; Saraf, Sharada; Grubaugh, Nathan D.; Andersen, Kristian G.; Thissen, James; Allen, Jonathan; Borucki, Monica; Tsetsarkin, Konstantin A.; Pletnev, Alexander G.; Chiu, Charles Y.; Van Rompay, Koen K.

To engage Latinx people in advocacy for health equity based on this population’s heavy share of smartphone, social media, and Twitter users, Salud America! launched the #SaludTues Tweetchat series. In this paper, we explore the use of #SaludTues to promote advocacy for Latinx health equity. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to understand how #SaludTues Tweetchats are used to promote dissemination of culturally relevant information on social determinants of health, to determine whether tweetchats serve to drive web traffic to the Salud America! website, and to understand who participates in #SaludTues Tweetchats and what we can learn about the participants. We also aim to share our own experiences and present a step-by-step guide of how tweetchats are planned, developed, promoted, and executed. METHODS: We explored tweetchat data collected between 2014 and 2018 using Symplur and Google Analytics to identify groups of stakeholders and web traffic. Network analysis and mapping tools were also used to derive insights from this series of chats. RESULTS: We conducted 187 chats with 24,609 reported users, 177,466 tweets, and more than 1.87 billion impressions using the hashtag #SaludTues during this span, demonstrating effective dissemination of and exposure to culturally relevant information. Traffic to the Salud America! website was higher on Tuesdays than any other day of the week, suggesting that #SaludTues Tweetchats acted effectively as a website traffic–driving tool. Most participants came from advocacy organizations (165/1000, 16.5%) and other health care–related organizations (162/1000, 16.2%), whereas others were unknown users (147/1000, 14.7%) and individual users outside of the health care sector (117/1000, 11.7%). The majority of participants were located in Texas, California, New York, and Florida, all states with high Latinx populations. CONCLUSIONS: Carefully planned, culturally relevant tweetchats such as #SaludTues can be a powerful tool for public health practitioners and advocates to engage audiences on Twitter around health issues, advocacy, and policy solutions for Latino health equity. Further information is needed to determine the effect that #SaludTues Tweetchats have on self- and collective efficacy for advocacy in the area of Latino health equity.","Ramirez, Amelie G; Aguilar, Rosalie P; Merck, Amanda; Despres, Cliff; Sukumaran, Pramod; Cantu-Pawlik, Stacy; Chalela, Patricia",JMIR Public Health Surveill,479,5

However, the expression and functions of lncRNAs during early human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (EHI) remain unclear. METHODS: 3 HAART-naive EHI patients and 3 healthy controls (HCs) were recruited in this study to perform RNA sequencing and microRNA (miRNA) sequencing. The expression profiles of lncRNAs, mRNAs and miRNAs were obtained, and the potential roles of lncRNAs were analysed based on discovering lncRNA cis-regulatory target mRNAs and constructing lncRNA–miRNA–mRNA competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks. Then, Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses were performed on 175 lncRNA-associated differentially expressed (DE) mRNAs to investigate the potential functions of DE lncRNAs in ceRNA networks. RESULTS: A total of 242 lncRNAs, 1240 mRNAs and 21 mature known miRNAs were determined as differentially expressed genes in HAART-naive EHI patients compared to HCs. Among DE lncRNAs, 44 lncRNAs were predicted to overlap with 41 target mRNAs, and 107 lncRNAs might regulate their nearby DE mRNAs. Two DE lncRNAs might regulate their cis-regulatory target mRNAs BTLA and ZAP70, respectively, which were associated with immune activation. In addition, the ceRNA networks comprised 160 DE lncRNAs, 21 DE miRNAs and 175 DE mRNAs. Seventeen DE lncRNAs were predicted to regulate HIF1A and TCF7L2, which are involved in the process of HIV-1 replication. Twenty DE lncRNAs might share miRNA response elements (MREs) with FOS, FOSB and JUN, which are associated with both immune activation and HIV-1 replication. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed that lncRNAs might play a critical role in HIV-1 replication and immune activation during EHI. These novel findings are helpful for understanding of the pathogenesis of HIV infection and provide new insights into antiviral therapy.

This study aimed to characterize differences in gastrointestinal endoscopies in the New York metropolitan region before, during, and after the first wave of the pandemic. METHODS: Across 3 hospitals, we compared demographics, indications, and yield of endoscopies before and after March 16, 2020, the date on which elective procedures were canceled, as well as a recovery period for 5 months after they were resumed. RESULTS: A total of 9,401 procedures before and 332 procedures during the first wave were performed. Females comprised 57 and 44% of patients (p < 0.01), respectively. There was a decline in the proportion of Black (15 vs. 7%, p < 0.02) and Hispanic patients (29 vs. 16%, p < 0.02) undergoing outpatient procedures. There was a significant rise in urgent indications such as bleeding and jaundice. There was an increase in the diagnostic yield of all esophagogastroduodenoscopies for bleeding (p < 0.01) and of outpatient endoscopic ultrasounds for malignancy (p = 0.01), but no increase in yield of inpatient colonoscopy for bleeding. A review of 7,475 procedures during the recovery period showed a return to many nonurgent indications, but still showed decreased proportions of Hispanic and male patients compared to the prepandemic period. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: Lower proportions of Black and Hispanic patients underwent outpatient endoscopies during and after the first wave. The proportion of procedures done for emergent indications and their diagnostic yield increased during the pandemic, suggesting a higher threshold to perform endoscopy. In resource-sparing conditions, clinicians should pay attention to thresholds to perform colonoscopy for bleeding and to racial disparities in outpatient healthcare access.","Annadurai, Vasantham; Blackett, John W.; Freedberg, Daniel; Hur, Chin; Green, Peter H.R.; Lebwohl, Benjamin",Dig Dis,479,1

It is particularly developed in the northern part of the country, where 70% of the whole Italian cattle population is reared. The cattle industry development in the rest of the country is hampered by the hard orography of the territories and a variety of socioeconomic features leading to the persistence of the traditional rural farming systems. The differences in the farming systems (industrial vs. traditional) also affect the health status of the farms. Whereas, Enzootic Bovine Leukosis (EBL) is almost eradicated across the whole country, in Southern Italy where Bovine Tuberculosis and Brucellosis are still present and Bluetongue is endemic due to the presence of the competent vector (Culicoides imicola), less investments are aimed at controlling diseases with economic impact or at improving farm biosecurity. On the other hand, with the eradication of these diseases in most part of the country, the need has emerged for reducing the economic burden of non-regulated endemic disease and control programs (CPs) for specific diseases have been implemented at regional level, based on the needs of each territory (for instance common grazing or trading with neighboring countries). This explains the coexistence of different types of programs in force throughout the country. Nowadays in Italy, among cattle diseases with little or no EU regulations only three are regulated by a national CP: Enzootic Bovine Leukosis, Bluetongue and Paratuberculosis, while Bovine Genital Campylobacteriosis and Trichomonosis are nationwide controlled only in breeding bulls. For some of the remaining diseases (Infectious Bovine Rhinotracheitis, Bovine Viral Diarrhea, Streptococcus agalactiae) specific CPs have been implemented by the regional Authorities, but for most of them a CP does not exist at all. However, there is a growing awareness among farmers and public health authorities that animal diseases have a major impact not only on the farm profitability but also on animal welfare and on the use of antibiotics in livestock. It is probable that in the near future other CPs will be implemented.","Tamba, Marco; Pallante, Ivana; Petrini, Stefano; Feliziani, Francesco; Iscaro, Carmen; Arrigoni, Norma; Di Sabatino, Daria; Barberio, Antonio; Cibin, Veronica; Santi, Annalisa; Ianniello, Marco; Ruocco, Luigi; Pozzato, Nicola",Front Vet Sci,479,1

Upon zinc perception, Zur binds to the promoters of zinc responsive genes and controls their transcription. However, the mechanism underlying zinc-mediated Zur activation remains unclear. Here we report a 2.2-Å crystal structure of apo Zur from the phytopathogen Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris (XcZur), which reveals the molecular mechanism that XcZur exists in a closed inactive state before regulatory zinc binding. Subsequently, we present a 1.9-Å crystal structure of holo XcZur, which, by contrast, adopts an open state that has enough capacity to bind DNA. Structural comparison and hydrogen deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) analyses uncover that binding of a zinc atom in the regulatory site, formed by the hinge region, the dimerization domain and the DNA binding domain, drives a closed-to-open conformational change that is essential for XcZur activation. Moreover, key residues responsible for DNA recognition are identified by site-directed mutagenesis. This work provides important insights into zinc-induced XcZur activation and valuable discussions on the mechanism of DNA recognition.","Liu, Fenmei; Su, Zihui; Chen, Peng; Tian, Xiaolin; Wu, Lijie; Tang, Dong-Jie; Li, Peifang; Deng, Haiteng; Ding, Pengfei; Fu, Qiang; Tang, Ji-Liang; Ming, Zhenhua",Nucleic Acids Res,479,1

Previous studies have reported association of volume and colour (bile and blood stained) of gastric residuals (GR) with NEC. We aimed to study this association in our cohort of extremely preterm (EP) infants. In a case–control study using retrospective data (January 2006–December 2011), EP (gestation < 28 weeks) infants with confirmed NEC ≥ stage II (cases) were compared with infants without NEC (controls) matched for birth weight (BW) and gestational age (GA). Forty cases of NEC ≥ stage II diagnosed at a median (IQR) age of 16.5 days (10.3–23) were compared with 40 controls matched for gestation (± 3 days) and birth weight (± 680 g). Median maximum GR volume (GRV) from birth to the day of occurrence of NEC was significantly higher in cases vs. controls (5.9 vs.3.7 ml; p < 0.001). Increased maximum GRV was associated with NEC ≥ Stage II in adjusted analysis (aOR 1.36, 95%CI 1.06–1.75, p = 0.017). There was no significant difference in GRV between cases and controls throughout the clinical course, including 72, 48 and 24 h before the onset of NEC. However, green (65.0% vs. 27.5%, p = 0.001) and haemorrhagic GRs (45.0% vs. 27.5%, p = 0.092) were higher 24 h before the diagnosis of NEC. Conclusion: GRV was not associated with NEC ≥ stage II. However, green and haemorrhagic GRs were significantly higher 24 h before the diagnosis of the illness.

OBJECTIVE: Although health care professionals (HCPs) can provide counseling, no method of providing individualized information on the expected bleeding pattern or continued support is currently available for women experiencing postplacement bleeding changes. We aim to develop a mobile phone–based medical app (MyIUS) to meet this need and provide a digital companion to women after the placement of the intrauterine system. METHODS: The MyIUS app is classified as a medical device and uses an artificial intelligence–based bleeding pattern prediction algorithm to estimate a woman’s future bleeding pattern in terms of intensity and regularity. We developed the app with the help of a multidisciplinary team by using a robust and high-quality design process in the context of a constantly evolving regulatory landscape. The development framework consisted of a phased approach including ideation, feasibility and concept finalization, product development, and product deployment or localization stages. RESULTS: The MyIUS app was considered useful by HCPs and easy to use by women who were consulted during the development process. Following the launch of the sustainable app in selected pilot countries, performance metrics will be gathered to facilitate further technical and feature updates and enhancements. A real-world performance study will also be conducted to allow us to upgrade the app in accordance with the new European Commission Medical Device legislation and to validate the bleeding pattern prediction algorithm in a real-world setting. CONCLUSIONS: By providing a meaningful estimation of bleeding patterns and allowing an individualized approach to counseling and discussions about contraceptive method choice, the MyIUS app offers a useful tool that may benefit both women and HCPs.

For new mothers, the postpartum period is recognized as a critical period for increased risk of both physical and mental health concerns. For this reason, it is imperative that women receive accurate, evidence-based information during this time. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to explore the conversations of new mothers on a web-based parenting forum to investigate what topics or concerns are being discussed. METHODS: A leading Australian web-based support forum for women before and after birth was used to obtain a sample of posts from the mothers of infants aged 0-12 months. Quantitative data (word frequencies and sentiment analysis) and qualitative data (post content) were extracted from discussion threads and examined to determine sentiments and theoretical storylines. RESULTS: In total, 260 posts were sampled. Infant care was the most prominent overarching topic discussed, with feeding and sleep being the most discussed subtopics. Discussions about maternal care were much less frequent but included questions about birth recovery, breastfeeding concerns, and interconception. A pattern of behavior emerged within the posts. This pattern resembled a cycle of learning across five phases: help seeking, solution ideation, testing and skill development, consolidation, and empowerment and improved mental well-being. A dynamic interplay was observed as mothers navigated new concerns or developmental changes. CONCLUSIONS: Engagement in web-based forums to seek help and support during the postpartum period was common, with infant health and well-being being the primary concerns for new mothers during this time. The identification of a maternal learning cycle within the forum underscores the contributory role of web-based communities in maternal peer social support, information seeking, and early parenting practices.","Chivers, Bonnie R; Garad, Rhonda M; Moran, Lisa J; Lim, Siew; Harrison, Cheryce L",J Med Internet Res,479,22

Its efficiency strongly depends on the function and composition of the immune system. If the immune system lacks critical components, patients will not be fully protected despite a completed vaccination schedule. Antigen-specific serum immunoglobulin levels are broadly used correlates of protection. These are the products of terminally differentiated B cells – plasma cells. Here we reviewed the literature on how aberrancies in B-cell composition and function influence immune responses to vaccinations. In a search through five major literature databases, 6,537 unique articles published from 2000 and onwards were identified. 75 articles were included along three major research lines: extremities of life, immunodeficiency and immunosuppression. Details of the protocol can be found in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews [PROSPERO (registration number CRD42021226683)]. The majority of articles investigated immune responses in adults, in which vaccinations against pneumococci and influenza were strongly represented. Lack of baseline information was the most common reason of exclusion. Irrespective of study group, three parameters measured at baseline seemed to have a predictive value in assessing vaccine efficacy: (1) distribution of B-cell subsets (mostly a reduction in memory B cells), (2) presence of exhausted/activated B cells, or B cells with an aberrant phenotype, and (3) pre-existing immunological memory. In this review we showed how pre-immunization (baseline) knowledge of circulating B cells can be used to predict vaccination efficacy. We hope that this overview will contribute to optimizing vaccination strategies, especially in immunocompromised patients.","Diks, Annieck M.; Overduin, Lisanne A.; van Leenen, Laurens D.; Slobbe, Lennert; Jolink, Hetty; Visser, Leonardus G.; van Dongen, Jacques J.

The key issue is that PAH is a form of PH. On the opposite, PH does not automatically imply PAH. Pulmonary arterial hypertension must be differentiated from other causes of PH that are frequently seen in ICU. It was recently emphasized that pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD) must be differentiated from PH and PAH. The prognosis of PAH was consistently improved in the ten past years by introduction of selective pulmonary vasodilators and management by highly specialized medical teams. In ICU patients, PAH remains a severe disease with a high mortality rate. When PAH is suspected, a systematic diagnosis approach is of particular importance in order to rapidly eliminate left cardiac, thromboembolic and pulmonary causes of PH. Left cardiac disease is the most common cause of PH. Early recognition of PAH allows a rapid introduction of selective pulmonary vasodilators that can improve outcome.

We noticed a marked increase in the number of blood cultures positive for coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species (CoNS) that highlights unique challenges that arise with the creation of new units and workflows. METHODS: We reviewed all blood culture results from the COVID-19 intensive care unit (CoVICU) from April 15 to May 29. We reviewed all blood cultures taken from the oncology ward, medical intensive care unit (MICU), and emergency department (ED) for the same time frame as a comparison. We calculated contamination rates, using the clinical microbiology laboratory criteria for possible contaminants based on species and number of positive blood cultures. RESULTS: There were 324 total blood cultures collected from the CoVICU with 27/324 (8.3%) positive for organisms deemed contaminant, 10/324 (3.1%) were positive considered bloodstream infections (BSI); the ratio of BSI:contaminant was 1:2.7. For the MICU, ED, and oncology units contamination rates were 2/197 (1%), 33/747 (4.4%), and 2/334 (0.6%), respectively; and the ratio of BSI:contaminant was 5:1, 2.2:1, and 17.5:1, respectively. There was a significant relationship between contamination rates and unit, X(2)(3, N = 1602) = 30.85, p < 0.001. CONCLUSION: Upon investigation, peripheral blood draw kits were not stocked in the CoVICU. Additionally, certain components of standard work for blood culture collection (e.g. glove exchange) could not be performed per usual practice due to isolation precautions. Peripheral blood draws were routinely performed by nurses in CoVICU and MICU while phlebotomy performed these in other comparison units. We suspect that lack of availability of blood draw kits and disruption of typical workflow in isolation rooms contributed to an unusually high number of contaminated blood cultures among patients admitted to the CoVICU. Notably, the CoVICU and MICU providers were the same pool of caregivers, further supporting a process issue related to isolation precautions. Institutions should be aware of the need for extra attention to supply chain management and examination of disruption to standard work that arise in the management of COVID-19 patients.

There is currently no treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration. Multiple agents have been used off-label to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection based on small observational cohorts and in vitro data. Here we present the experience of a large academic medical center in treating SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients admitted for greater than 24 hours with a nasopharyngeal, oropharyngeal, and/or bronchoalveolar lavage sample positive for SARS-CoV-2 by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Demographic data, comorbidities, clinical data, and treatment data were collected from the electronic medical record. Off-label therapies were used at the discretion of the treating providers guided by regularly updated treatment guidelines assembled by infectious diseases physicians and antimicrobial stewardship pharmacists. The primary outcome assessed was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), endotracheal intubation, initiation of vasopressors, and drug-related adverse events. RESULTS: Data collection was completed for 448 patients admitted between March 18, 2020 and May 8, 2020. All-cause in-hospital mortality was 13.4% (60/448) during this time. Mortality rates increased with age, up to 45% for patients over 80 years old. Male sex, hypertension, chronic pulmonary disease, end-stage renal disease, chronic liver disease were also risk factors for increased mortality. QTc interval prolongation occurred significantly more frequently in patients who received hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) with or without azithromycin(AZM) than those who did not (HCQ 6%, HCQ+AZM 7.8% vs all other patients, 0%, p< .0001).

Chemotherapy use and ICU admission shortly before death were relatively infrequent in the Netherlands. Chemotherapy was used less often in hospitals that treat many patients compared to hospitals that treat fewer patients. In patients that received chemotherapy before their final three months before death, chemotherapy was prescribed four times more often in the last three months before death compared to patients without previous chemotherapy use. ABSTRACT: Since intensive care unit (ICU) admission and chemotherapy use near death impair the quality of life, we studied the prevalence of both and their correlation with hospital volume in incurable gastroesophageal cancer patients as both impair the quality of life. We analyzed all Dutch patients with incurable gastroesophageal cancer who died in 2017–2018. National insurance claims data were used to determine the prevalence of ICU admission and chemotherapy use (stratified on previous chemotherapy treatment) at three and one month(s) before death. We calculated correlations between hospital volume (i.e., the number of included patients per hospital) and both outcomes. We included 3748 patients (mean age: 71.4 years; 71.4% male). The prevalence of ICU admission and chemotherapy use were, respectively, 5.6% and 21.2% at three months and 4.2% and 8.0% at one month before death. Chemotherapy use at three and one months before death was, respectively, 4.3 times (48.0% vs. 11.2%) and 3.7 times higher (15.7% vs. 4.3%), comparing patients with previous chemotherapy treatment to those without. Hospital volume was negatively correlated with chemotherapy use in the final month (r(weighted) = −0.23, p = 0.04). ICU admission and chemotherapy use were relatively infrequent. Oncologists in high-volume hospitals may be better equipped in selecting patients most likely to benefit from chemotherapy.","Besseling, Joost; Reitsma, Jan; Van Erkelens, Judith A.; Schepens, Maike H.

This is to increase the impact on a universities’ ability to lead in technological advancement with goals to enhance innovation and accelerate the concept-to-deployment process. Technological progress in the fields of electronics, wireless communication, cognitive computing, and robotics has caused almost everything which connects to electricity to have a small processor and sensor embedded with itself [1]. Cognitive or Intelligent embedded systems are the ‘core’ of trends such as: reduced energy consumption, deep learning applications, improved security for embedded devices, cloud connectivity and mesh networking, and visualization tools with real time data. This paper is aimed at stimulating design and innovation in electronics education through the rapid prototyping of configurable embedded systems. It also covers remote access functionality is also shown using cloud services. Divided into two parts, this paper gives design examples for both an elevator controller and a Data Acquisition (DAQ) system design. Focus was on the Programmable System on Chip (PSoC) 6 based kit, PSoC Creator software, and Laboratory Virtual Instrumentation Engineering Workbench (LabVIEW) as rapid prototyping and learning platforms for digital and analog system designs. The Universal Digital Block (UDB) editor in PSoC Creator software was used to configure PSoC chip digital blocks and design a Finite State Machine (FSM) based elevator controller, which acquired digital signals and gave corresponding output. LabVIEW was used as a signal analysis tool and was also used to send results for online access and display. The PSoC and LabVIEW ecosystems are utilized here to bring an innovative paradigm into the embedded system design. These two platforms, especially combined with the virtual instrumentation concept, offer configurability and monetary value. This paper shows that the use of these ecosystems for the purpose of electronics education can accelerate learning and bridge the gaps within the online environments that students and universities find increasingly necessary.","Chamunorwa, Tinashe; Ursutiu, D.; Samoila, C.; Modran, Horia Alexandru",Educating Engineers for Future Industrial Revolutions,479,1

Simultaneously, planned renovation of the campus swine teaching farm required depopulation of the existing herd. Hence, animal access for course laboratories was restricted for the 2020 spring and fall semesters. The objective is to present strategies to achieve effective laboratory learning objectives with limited livestock access. Average course enrollment in 2020 spring and fall semesters was 11 students of junior and senior standing. The course laboratory was held for two hours weekly for fifteen weeks. COVID-19 interruption of the spring semester, and arrival of pigs to the campus swine teaching farm in the fall semester, necessitated creation of ten equivalent laboratory sessions per semester. Example laboratory sessions include: panels with swine industry professionals, Pork Quality Assurance version 4.0 certification, virtual farm tours, evaluating genetic merit with National Swine Registry Swine Testing and Genetic Evaluation System EPD data and indexes, understanding least-cost diet formulation with diet formulation software, creating and implementing a Secure Pork Supply enhanced biosecurity plan for the campus swine farm, and multiple case study models of troubleshooting reproductive deficiencies with the US Pork Center of Excellence National Swine Reproduction Guide. Laboratory session execution facilitated achievement of TAMU Department of Animal Science programmatic learning outcomes, specifically: understanding animal breeding programs, animal husbandry, reproductive management, and nutrient conversion, and assessing business models and application of animal management strategies. In future semesters with unrestricted swine access for teaching, live-animal handling will be emphasized in the syllabus, yet preservation of effective classroom-based laboratories will persist. These methods have value for instructors operating without campus swine resources and those whose laboratory content has been impacted by COVID-19 disruption.","Austin, Adrian G; Wiegert, Jeff G",J Anim Sci,479,29

Following on three relevant dimensions—the visibility of political scientists, their partisanship and their impact in the public sphere—and combining press analysis with original survey data, this article has two main aims: first, to assess Italian political scientists’ (IPSs) social relevance in a period of huge political and institutional conflict such as the constitutional referendum held in December 2016; second, to explore the potential factors leading IPSs to be more or less present in the public debate. For the former, we focus on the public visibility of IPSs during the referendum campaign, as well as on the content of their public interventions, both concerning their neutral/partisan stance and their attitudes towards the constitutional reform. For the latter, we empirically test a few personal and institutional factors that are likely to influence individuals’ participation in the referendum debate.","Vicentini, Giulia; Pritoni, Andrea",Eur Polit Sci,479,1

The country is free of all EU-regulated cattle diseases of categories A and B. Infectious bovine rhinotracheitis, enzootic bovine leucosis, bovine viral diarrhea, bluetongue, bovine genital campylobacteriosis, and trichomoniasis do not currently exist in the country. The prevalence of paratuberculosis, Mycoplasma bovis, salmonella infection, and Q-fever is low. The geographic location, cold climate, low cattle density, and limited animal imports have contributed to the favorable disease situation. Besides screening for selected regulated diseases, the national disease-monitoring program includes periodic active monitoring of non-regulated diseases, which allows assessment of the need for new control measures. The detection of diseases through efficient passive surveillance also plays an important part in disease monitoring. The Finnish cattle population totals 850,000 animals kept on 9,300 cattle farms, with 62,000 suckler cows in 2,100 herds and 260,000 dairy cows in 6,300 herds. Animal Health ETT, an association owned by the dairy and meat industry, keeps a centralized cattle health care register. Animal Health ETT supervises cattle imports and trade within the country and runs voluntary control programs (CP) for selected diseases. Active cooperation between authorities, the cattle industry, Animal Health ETT, and herd health experts enables the efficient planning and implementation of CPs. CPs have been implemented for non-EU-regulated diseases such as salmonella, M. bovis, ringworm, and Streptococcus agalactiae. The CP for salmonellosis is compulsory and includes all Salmonella serotypes and all cattle types. It has achieved the goal of keeping the salmonella prevalence under 1% of cattle herds. CPs for M. bovis, ringworm, and S. agalactiae are on a voluntary basis and privately funded. The CP for Mycoplasma was designed in collaboration with national experts and has been implemented since 2013. The CP includes observation of clinical signs, nasal swab sampling from calves, and bulk tank milk and clinical mastitis samples for M. bovis. Mycoplasma bovis-negative herds gradually achieve lower status levels for M. bovis infection. The general challenge facing voluntary CPs is getting farms to join the programs.","Autio, Tiina; Tuunainen, Erja; Nauholz, Hannele; Pirkkalainen, Hertta; London, Laura; Pelkonen, Sinikka",Front Vet Sci,479,0

More than 6000 procedures are performed in the United States annually with excellent survival rates. The shortage of donor organs leads to continued interest in techniques to enlarge the potential donor pool. Patients presenting for liver transplant suffer from important cardiovascular, respiratory, renal, neurological, and gastroenterological comorbidity. In the Western world, liver failure is increasingly caused by steatohepatitis, and transplant candidates are thus becoming older and more comorbid. The role of the transplant anesthesiologist is highly important in the preoperative assessment, intraoperative management, and postoperative care of these complex and sick patients. Appropriate investigation and management of comorbidities such as coronary artery disease and portopulmonary hypertension is controversial and differs between programs. The transplant procedure is a major surgery, and although massive transfusion is no longer commonplace, there is potential for significant hemodynamic instability, coagulopathy, and metabolic disturbance. Liver transplant surgery can be divided into the preanhepatic phase, the anhepatic phase, and the reperfusion phase, with important anesthetic considerations at each point. An understanding of the surgical techniques used for vascular exclusion of the liver and the role of venovenous bypass is crucial for the anesthesiologist. Recent trends in perioperative care include the use of antifibrinolytic drugs and point-of-care coagulation tests, intraoperative renal replacement therapy, and ""fast-track"" extubation and postoperative care. Care of patients with fulminant hepatic failure or those receiving split-liver grafts requires special consideration.","Hall, Timothy H; Dhir, Achal",Seminars in cardiothoracic and vascular anesthesia,479,16

METHODS A database of 100 MT cases was maintained throughout May 2010-February 2015 as part of a statewide service provided across two tertiary hospitals (H1 and H2). Patient demographics, stroke and procedural details, blinded angiographic outcomes, and 90-day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores were recorded. The following time points in stroke treatment were recorded: stroke onset, hospital presentation, CT imaging, arteriotomy, and recanalization. Statistical analysis of outcomes, predictors of outcome, and differences between the hospitals was carried out. RESULTS Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (TICI) 2b/3 reperfusion was 79%. Forty-nine per cent of patients had good clinical outcomes (mRS 0-2). In a subgroup analysis of 76 patients with premorbid mRS 0-1 and first CT performed ≤4.5 h after stroke onset, 60% had good clinical outcomes. Patient and disease characteristics were matched between the two hospitals. H1 had shorter times between hospital presentation and CT (32 vs 55 min, p=0.01), CT and arteriotomy (33 vs 69 min, p=0.00), and stroke onset and recanalization (198 vs 260 min, p=0.00). These time metrics independently predicted good clinical outcome. Median days spent at home in the first 90 days was greater at H1 (61 vs 8, p=0.04) than at H2. A greater proportion of patients treated at H1 were independent (mRS 0-2) at 90 days (54% vs 42%); however, this was not statistically significant (p=0.22). CONCLUSIONS Outcomes similar to randomized controlled trials are attainable in 'real-world' settings. Workflow time metrics were independent predictors of clinical outcome, and differed between the two hospitals owing to site-specific organizational differences.","Kabra, Ruchi; Phillips, Timothy J; Saw, Jacqui-Lyn; Phatouros, Constantine C; Singh, Tejinder P; Hankey, Graeme J; Blacker, David; Ghia, Darshan; Prentice, David; McAuliffe, William",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,479,27

Control of outbreaks may include isolation and/or cohorting, and prophylaxis or treatment with specific antiviral agents may be indicated, all dependent upon the specific cause of the outbreak. Conventional methods of viral diagnosis detect only a limited number of the viruses that are known to cause outbreaks. The availability of sensitive and specific molecular assays has facilitated rapid diagnosis of a wider range of viruses from respiratory outbreaks. Molecular methods have distinct advantages over conventional methods, including the ability to rapidly develop assays for emerging viruses and new variants of existing viruses. In addition, molecular testing allows rapid detection of resistance to antiviral agents or mutations leading to increased virulence.

METHODS We combined individual patient data from 6 randomized clinical trials (CAPRIE, ESPS-2, MATCH, CHARISMA, ESPRIT, and PRoFESS) investigating antiplatelet therapy after TIA or ischemic stroke. Cox regression analyses stratified by trial were performed to study the association between predictors and major bleeding. A risk prediction model was derived and validated in the PERFORM trial. Performance was assessed with the c statistic and calibration plots. RESULTS Major bleeding occurred in 1,530 of the 43,112 patients during 94,833 person-years of follow-up. The observed 3-year risk of major bleeding was 4.6% (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.4%-4.9%). Predictors were male sex, smoking, type of antiplatelet agents (aspirin-clopidogrel), outcome on modified Rankin Scale ≥3, prior stroke, high blood pressure, lower body mass index, elderly, Asian ethnicity, and diabetes (S2TOP-BLEED). The S2TOP-BLEED score had a c statistic of 0.63 (95% CI 0.60-0.64) and showed good calibration in the development data. Major bleeding risk ranged from 2% in patients aged 45-54 years without additional risk factors to more than 10% in patients aged 75-84 years with multiple risk factors. In external validation, the model had a c statistic of 0.61 (95% CI 0.59-0.63) and slightly underestimated major bleeding risk. CONCLUSIONS The S2TOP-BLEED score can be used to estimate 3-year major bleeding risk in patients with a TIA or ischemic stroke who use antiplatelet agents, based on readily available characteristics. The discriminatory performance may be improved by identifying stronger predictors of major bleeding.","Hilkens, Nina A; Algra, Ale; Diener, Hans-Christoph; Reitsma, Johannes B; Bath, Philip M; Csiba, Laszlo; Hacke, Werner; Kappelle, L Jaap; Koudstaal, Peter J; Leys, Didier; Mas, Jean-Louis; Sacco, Ralph L; Amarenco, Pierre; Sissani, Leila; Greving, Jacoba P",Neurology,479,1

One of its advantages is the significant reduction in radiation damage, which is especially useful in synchrotron experiments. Another advantage is that cryopreservation provides simple storage of crystals and easy transportation to a synchrotron. However, this technique sometimes results in the undesirable adhesion of frost to mounted crystals. The frost produces noisy diffraction images and reduces the optical visibility of crystals, which is crucial for aligning the crystal position with the incident X-ray position. To resolve these issues, a computer-controlled device has been developed that drizzles liquid nitrogen over a crystal to remove frost. It was confirmed that the device works properly, reduces noise from ice rings in diffraction images and enables the centering of crystals with low visibility owing to frost adhesion.","Nakamura, Yuki; Baba, Seiki; Mizuno, Nobuhiro; Irie, Takaki; Ueno, Go; Hirata, Kunio; Ito, Sho; Hasegawa, Kazuya; Yamamoto, Masaki; Kumasaka, Takashi","Acta crystallographica.

Thereby, scholars are calling for media literacy as an educative means to cultivate fact-checking behavior among information consumers. Focusing on the critical role of metacognition for education effectiveness, this study examined the underlying mechanism that is conducive to the success of media literacy in the context of health information consumption. Based on the survey data collected from 502 Reddit.com users, our findings showed that media literacy was positively associated with fact-checking behavior for health information. Mediation analysis indicated that metacognition mediated the positive relationship between media literacy and fact-checking behavior. In addition, moderated-mediation analysis demonstrated that the mediating effect was weaker for individuals who had higher exposure to health information. The study sheds light on the factors that are essential for the success of media literacy.

Visual assessment conducted in 2015 and 2016 recorded the prevalence and severity of lesions. Opportunistic sampling for disease testing was conducted on a subset of 39 sun bears, with histopathological examination of lip and tongue biopsies and PCR testing of oral swabs and tissue biopsies collected during health examinations. Lip lesions were similarly prevalent in 2015 (66.0%) and 2016 (68.3%). Degradation of lip lesion severity was seen between 2015 and 2016, and the odds of having lip lesions, having more severe lip lesions, and having lip lesion degradation over time, all increased with age. Cheilitis was found in all lip lesion biopsies, with histological confirmation of squamous cell carcinoma in 64.5% of cases. Single biopsies frequently showed progression from dysplasia to neoplasia. Eighteen of 31 sun bears (58.1%) had at least one sample positive for Ursid gammaherpesvirus 1. The virus was detected in sun bears with and without lip lesions, however due to case selection being strongly biased towards those showing lip lesions it was not possible to test for association between Ursid gammaherpesvirus 1 and lip squamous cell carcinoma. Given gammaherpesviruses can play a role in cancer development under certain conditions in other species, we believe further investigation into Ursid gammaherpesvirus 1 as one of a number of possible co-factors in the progression of lip lesions to squamous cell carcinoma is warranted. This study highlights the progressively neoplastic nature of this lip lesion syndrome in sun bears which has consequences for captive and re-release management. Similarly, the detection of Ursid gammaherpesvirus 1 should be considered in pre-release risk analyses, at least until data is available on the prevalence of the virus in wild sun bears.","Officer, Kirsty; Pruvot, Mathieu; Horwood, Paul; Denk, Daniela; Warren, Kris; Hul, Vibol; Thy, Nhim; Broadis, Nev; Dussart, Philippe; Jackson, Bethany",PloS one,479,16

This was already noted in the first CAP guidelines, published in 1993, and the challenges regarding the outpatient management of CAP persist nowadays. These include the uncertainty of the initial diagnosis and risk stratification, the empirical choice of antibiotics, the overgrowing of antibiotic resistance bacteria and the relative scarcity of novel antibiotics. RECENT FINDINGS New molecular biology methods have changed the etiologic perspective of CAP, unveiling the role of virus. Diagnostic uncertainty may lead to antibiotic overuse and bacteria resistance. Novel antibiotics along with diagnostic improvement, related to the use of lung ultrasound and point-of-care biomarkers testing, may help to improve CAP treatment. Prevention, especially the use of antipneumococcal vaccine, is instrumental in reducing the burden of disease. SUMMARY Most of CAP cases are managed in the outpatient setting. However, most research is focused on hospitalized severe patients. New and awaited advances might contribute to aid diagnosis, cause and assessment of patients with CAP in the community. This knowledge might prove decisive in improving outcomes, as well as to the execution of stewardship programs that maintain current antibiotics, safeguard future ones and reinforce prevention.","Froes, Filipe; Pereira, João Gonçalves; Póvoa, Pedro",Current opinion in pulmonary medicine,479,1

Strains of this virus are a human pandemic threat and a severe economic burden on poultry production. Over the past 20 years they have spread throughout Asia, Africa, Middle East and parts of Europe. As a global industry, a critical need is to re-imagine production and marketing chains, especially in low and middle income countries, where the structure of much of the industry facilitates virus transmission, especially, but not only, in improperly managed live poultry markets and related value chains. Better, appropriately matched vaccines are needed to support this process but such vaccines cannot, alone, overcome the existing defects in biosecurity, including high farm densities.

METHOD An integrative text mining analysis in Medline was performed to identify studies on the mental health of older adults during the pandemic. Subsequently, statistical topic modeling was performed to identify the most prevalent terms and topics discussed in included studies. RESULTS A total of 29 studies were retrieved until July 1st 2020, including a majority of letters (12 studies) and commentaries (8 studies). The most frequent terms overall were: loneliness (n = 137), support (n = 132), home (n = 102), suicide (n = 96) and help (n = 94). The most prevalent terms were then divided in five topics: home (33%), suicide (32%), apps (15%), loneliness (12%) and physical activity (9%). Additionally, a section focused on low- and middle-income countries was included. A summary of strategies to mitigate the effects of pandemic in mental health of older adults was also provided.

Patients not receiving care due to closure of outpatient services suffer a collateral damage. Our aim was to provide first data on impact of Covid-19 on people experiencing disability in Europe. METHODS We developed an estimation from a survey and publicly available data. Thirty-eight countries have been inquired through the European Bodies of Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine - the rehabilitation medical specialty. The 9-questions focused on March 31st, 2020. We used the following indicators: for inpatients, acute and rehabilitative hospital beds; for outpatients, missing uniform European data, we used information from Italy, Belgium and UK, and estimated for Europe basing on population, number of rehabilitation physicians, physiotherapists, and people with self-reported limitations. FINDINGS Thirty-five countries (92%) including 99% of the population (809.9 million) answered. Stop of admissions to rehabilitation, early discharge and reduction of activities involved 194,800 inpatients in 10 countries. Outpatient activities stopped for 87%, involving 318,000 patients per day in Italy, Belgium and UK, leading to an estimate range of 1,3-2,2 million in Europe. Seven countries reported experiences on rehabilitation for acute Covid-19 patients. INTERPRETATION Covid-19 emergency is having a huge impact on rehabilitation of people experiencing disability. This may lead to future cumulative effects due to reduced functional outcome and consequent increased burden of care. When the emergency will fade, rehabilitation demand will probably grow due to an expected return wave of these not well treated patients, but probably also of post-Covid-19 patients' needs.","Negrini, Stefano; Grabljevec, Klemen; Boldrini, Paolo; Kiekens, Carlotte; Moslavac, Sasa; Zampolini, Mauro; Christodoulou, Nicolas",European journal of physical and rehabilitation medicine,479,5

Therefore, this study examined the psychological reactions of aging OHS during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD A convenience sample (N = 297, mean age = 66.85) of North American Jews rated posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms for their parents and for themselves. They further rated their psychological distress, COVID-19-related worries, loneliness, and social support. Respondents were divided into four groups: OHS with two parents with probable PTSD, with one such parent, with no such parent, and comparisons whose parents did not undergo the Holocaust. RESULTS OHS with two parents with PTSD reported the highest levels of PTSD symptoms. Controlling for respondents' own PTSD, OHS with two parents with PTSD reported higher psychological distress relative to comparisons. Moreover, OHS with parental PTSD reported higher loneliness relative to OHS without parental PTSD or comparisons. The groups did not differ in COVID-19-related worries or social support. CONCLUSIONS The distress experienced by OHS with parental PTSD seems more general, and is possibly related to the multiple coalescing crises that occurred since the pandemic began, rather than to the health risk associated directly with COVID-19. Moreover, while OHS acknowledge having good social support, some of them nevertheless feel lonely. This possibly reflects unique interpersonal difficulties characteristic in Holocaust survivor families. These findings suggest that OHS with parental PTSD (especially when both parents had symptoms) represent a group of older adults who are relatively susceptible to negative psychological effects of the current pandemic.

Biplanar radiographies were acquired at baseline, immediate post-operatively, 1-year and 2-year follow-up, and 3D reconstruction of the spine and pelvis was performed. NTK and THK showed different global sagittal alignment, as well as differences compared to controls. AIS with THK at baseline had higher SVA/SFD (2.0 ± 2.9 vs - 0.4 ± 1.9; P < 0.05) and OD-HA (0.2 ± 1.4° vs - 1.3 ± 1.6°; P < 0.05) than controls, indicating that THK had compensated balance with unusual forward leaning posture. Immediately post-operation, SVA/SFD remained high (1.3 ± 3.0) while OD-HA reversed (- 1.2 ± 1.7°), indicating that THK patients had found partially compensated balance. After 2-yeas, both SVA/SFD (- 1.3 ± 2.1) and OD-HA (- 1.4 ± 0.9°) were normalized. The changes in global sagittal alignment and mechanism of balance are different in AIS with or without THK.

Both infections are associated with a variety of clinical signs and can impact quality of life and longevity. SCOPE This document is an update of the 2008 American Association of Feline Practitioners' feline retrovirus management guidelines and represents current knowledge on pathogenesis, diagnosis, prevention and treatment of retrovirus infections in cats. TESTING AND INTERPRETATION Although vaccines are available for FeLV in many countries and for FIV in some countries, identification of infected cats remains an important factor for preventing new infections. The retrovirus status of every cat at risk of infection should be known. Cats should be tested as soon as possible after they are acquired, following exposure to an infected cat or a cat of unknown infection status, prior to vaccination against FeLV or FIV, and whenever clinical illness occurs. It might not be possible to determine a cat's infection status based on testing at a single point in time; repeat testing using different methods could be required. Although FeLV and FIV infections can be associated with clinical disease, some infected cats, especially those infected with FIV, can live for many years with good quality of life. MANAGEMENT OF INFECTED CATS There is a paucity of data evaluating treatments for infected cats, especially antiretroviral and immunomodulatory drugs. Management of infected cats is focused on effective preventive healthcare strategies, and prompt identification and treatment of illness, as well as limiting the spread of infection.","Little, Susan; Levy, Julie; Hartmann, Katrin; Hofmann-Lehmann, Regina; Hosie, Margaret; Olah, Glenn; Denis, Kelly St",Journal of feline medicine and surgery,479,23

Data on treatment are sparse. We systematically evaluated the literature on botulinum antitoxin and other treatments. Methods We conducted a systematic literature review of published articles in PubMed via Medline, Web of Science, Embase, Ovid, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and included all studies that reported on the clinical course and treatment for foodborne botulism. Articles were reviewed by 2 independent reviewers and independently abstracted for treatment type and toxin exposure. We conducted a meta-analysis on the effect of timing of antitoxin administration, antitoxin type, and toxin exposure type. Results We identified 235 articles that met the inclusion criteria, published between 1923 and 2016. Study quality was variable. Few (27%) case series reported sufficient data for inclusion in meta-analysis. Reduced mortality was associated with any antitoxin treatment (odds ratio [OR], 0.16; 95% confidence interval [CI], .09-.30) and antitoxin treatment within 48 hours of illness onset (OR, 0.12; 95% CI, .03-.41). Data did not allow assessment of critical care impact, including ventilator support, on survival. Therapeutic agents other than antitoxin offered no clear benefit. Patient characteristics did not predict poor outcomes. We did not identify an interval beyond which antitoxin was not beneficial. Conclusions Published studies on botulism treatment are relatively sparse and of low quality. Timely administration of antitoxin reduces mortality; despite appropriate treatment with antitoxin, some patients suffer respiratory failure. Prompt antitoxin administration and meticulous intensive care are essential for optimal outcome.","O'Horo, John C; Harper, Eugene P; El Rafei, Abdelghani; Ali, Rashid; DeSimone, Daniel C; Sakusic, Amra; Abu Saleh, Omar M; Marcelin, Jasmine R; Tan, Eugene M; Rao, Agam K; Sobel, Jeremy; Tosh, Pritish K",Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,479,5

This is because the patient, during the lockdown, was forced to leave the house and go several miles away to reach the place where the drug was dispensed. Moreover, very often, the place was placed in covid-19 hospitals, like the one in Perugia, and was also a risk for the patient himself. The logistical organization allows, in addition to the advantages of traceability, efficiency and savings, with the arrival of the drug at home, a very high patient compliance that also translates into greater security in a pandemic period. To the Usl Umbria 1 of Perugia (Italy) has been centralized the activity of warehouse for all the South area that includes three hospitals and four sanitary districts. Such warehouse, through computerized procedure, guarantees the direct distribution with sending of the medicines directly to the district of belonging of the patient. In this way the patient was not forced to make long and risky trips to continue their chronic therapies.

They were referred to the intended centers for COVID-19 diagnosis and management of Shiraz University of Medical Sciences in southern Iran. Two nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal throat swab samples were collected from each patient and tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) using real-time reverse-transcriptase- polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR). The samples were also tested for influenza viruses and the complete respiratory panel. RESULTS In the present report, four patients were diagnosed in the starting days of COVID-19 disease in our center in southern Iran with co-infection of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus.

Interventional treatment with mechanical thrombectomy-often in combination with acute stenting of underlying atherosclerotic stenosis or dissection-is increasingly used. It has been shown that such complex interventions are technically feasible. The lack of optimal management strategies and clinical data encouraged us to review our acute stroke interventions in patient with anterior circulation tandem lesions to determine lesion patterns, interventional approaches, and angiographic or clinical outcomes. PATIENTS AND METHODS We retrospectively analyzed a series of 39 consecutive patients with intracranial vessel occlusion of the anterior circulation simultaneously presenting with high-grade cervical internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis or occlusion. RESULTS Emergency ICA stent implantation was technically feasible in all patients, and intracranial recanalization with TICI ≥ 2b was reached in a large number of patients (64 %). Good clinical outcomes (mRS ≤ 2 at 3 months) were achieved in one third of the patients (36 %). Symptomatic hemorrhages occurred in four patients (10 %). Mortality was 10 %. CONCLUSION Endovascular recanalization of acute cervical carotid artery occlusion was technically feasible in all patients, and resulted in high extra- and intracranial revascularization rates. A trend for favorable clinical outcome was seen in a higher TICI score, younger age, good collateral status, and combined IV rTPA and endovascular therapy.","Lescher, Stephanie; Czeppan, Katja; Porto, Luciana; Singer, Oliver C; Berkefeld, Joachim",Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,479,17

In response to the virus, many clinics across the world abruptly closed their doors to persons with Parkinson's. Fortunately, a niche care model, telemedicine-first described in this journal a generation ago-emerged as the dominant means of providing care. As we adjust to a new normal, we should center future care not on clinics, but on patients. Their needs, guided by clinicians, should determine how care is delivered, whether in the clinic, at home, remotely, or by some combination. Within this patient-centered approach, telemedicine is an attractive care option but not a complete replacement for in-person consultations, which are valuable for specific problems and for those who have access. Now that many clinicians and patients have gained exposure to telemedicine, we can better appreciate its strengths (e.g., convenience) and limitations (e.g., restricted examination). We can also create a new future that utilizes the internet, video conferencing, smartphones, and sensors. This future will bring many clinicians to one patient, connect individual experts to countless patients, use widely available devices to facilitate diagnosis, and apply novel technologies to measure the disease in new ways. These approaches, which extend to education and research, enable a future where we can care for anyone anywhere, and we can begin to stem the tide of Parkinson's.","Dorsey, E Ray; Bloem, Bastiaan R; Okun, Michael S",Movement disorders : official journal of the Movement Disorder Society,479,1

These trends were not influenced by baseline blood pressure, left ventricular ejection fraction and previous MI. Patients with diabetes mellitus had a significantly higher risk of recurrent revascularization when submitted to PCI than CABG. Conclusion Patients with confirmed CAD in elective coronary angiography do not have a better prognosis when submitted to CABG comparatively to medical treatment. Patients treated with PCI had a trend for the lower incidence of combined cardiovascular events, at the expense of additional revascularization procedures. Patients without significant CAD had a similar prognosis than CAD patients treated with medical therapy.","Almeida, Adriana Silveira; Fuchs, Sandra C; Fuchs, Felipe C; Silva, Aline Gonçalves; Lucca, Marcelo Balbinot; Scopel, Samuel; Fuchs, Flávio D",Vascular health and risk management,479,1

The aim of this study were to compare two LAGBP techniques and analyze its postoperative outcomes, in order to standardize the procedure. METHODS Eighty patients who underwent LAGBP were enrolled in this study. Forty patients who underwent LAGBP (group 1) from December 2011 to June 2012 were compared with 40 patients (group 2) who underwent a modified LAGBP technique, which included preserving the right gastroepiploic vessels and uniform plication volume between July 2012 and January 2013. Relevant patient's data were collected and analyzed. RESULTS Both groups were similar in age, gender, preoperative body mass index (BMI), and hospital stay. The median total operative time was shorter in group 2 (100.5 min; range 41-189) compared to group 1 (124 min; range 63-192), p = 0.048. There were two major complications involving gastric fold herniation (GFH) in group 1, while none was seen in group 2, p = 0.07. The minor complications encountered in both groups were similar, p = 0.37. At 6-month follow-up, there was no difference in mean frequency of band adjustments, weight, and BMI reduction in both groups. No mortality was seen in our series. CONCLUSIONS A standardized LAGBP procedure which includes uniform plication volume and preservation of right gastroepiploic vessels could potentially avoid early GFH. However, larger comparative studies with longer follow-up would be needed to evaluate the late outcomes of this procedure and its efficacy in weight loss.","Malapan, Kirubakaran; Ghinagow, Ayham; Vij, Anirudh; Chang, Po-Chih; Hsin, Ming-Che; Huang, Chih-Kun",Obesity surgery,479,29

To date, researchers have focused on descriptive analyses that associate individual factors with health-seeking behaviors, without estimating of the strength of these predictive models. We developed predictive models by applying machine learning methods (i.e., elastic net and lasso regression models) to YARH's self-reports of internet use. The YARH were aged 14-24 years old (N = 1287) from Los Angeles and New Orleans. Models were fit to three binary indicators of YARH's lifetime internet searches for general health, sexual and reproductive health (SRH), and social service information. YARH responses regarding internet health information seeking were fed into machine learning models with potential predictor variables based on findings from previous research, including sociodemographic characteristics, sexual and gender minority identity, healthcare access and engagement, sexual behavior, substance use, and mental health. About half of the YARH reported seeking general health and SRH information and 26% sought social service information. Areas under the ROC curve (≥ .75) indicated strong predictive models and results were consistent with the existing literature. For example, higher education and sexual minority identification was associated with seeking general health, SRH, and social service information. New findings also emerged. Cisgender identity versus transgender and non-binary identities was associated with lower odds of general health, SRH, and social service information seeking. Experiencing intimate partner violence was associated with higher odds of seeking general health, SRH, and social service information. Findings demonstrate the ability to develop predictive models to inform targeted health information dissemination strategies but underscore the need to better understand health disparities that can be operationalized as predictors in machine learning algorithms.","Comulada, W Scott; Goldbeck, Cameron; Almirol, Ellen; Gunn, Heather J; Ocasio, Manuel A; Fernández, M Isabel; Arnold, Elizabeth Mayfield; Romero-Espinoza, Adriana; Urauchi, Stacey; Ramos, Wilson; Rotheram-Borus, Mary Jane; Klausner, Jeffrey D; Swendeman, Dallas",Prevention science : the official journal of the Society for Prevention Research,479,16

We sought to determine whether computed tomographic perfusion (CTP) selection improves endovascular therapy outcomes compared with noncontrast computed tomography alone. METHODS Review of a prospectively collected registry of anterior circulation stroke patients undergoing stent-retriever thrombectomy at a tertiary care center between September 2010 and March 2016. Patients undergoing CTP were compared with those with noncontrast computed tomography alone. The primary outcome was the shift in the 90-day modified Rankin scale (mRS). RESULTS A total of 602 patients were included. CTP-selected patients (n=365, 61%) were younger (P=0.02) and had fewer comorbidities. CTP selection (n=365, 61%) was associated with a favorable 90-day mRS shift (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]=1.49; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.06-2.09; P=0.02), higher rates of good outcomes (90-day mRS score 0-2: 52.9% versus 40.4%; P=0.005), modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction-3 reperfusion (54.8% versus 40.1%; P<0.001), smaller final infarct volumes (24.7 mL [9.8-63.1 mL] versus 34.6 mL [13.1-88 mL]; P=0.017), and lower mortality (16.6% versus 26.8%; P=0.005). When matched on age, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score, and glucose (n=424), CTP remained associated with a favorable 90-day mRS shift (P=0.016), lower mortality (P=0.02), and higher rates of reperfusion (P<0.001). CTP better predicted functional outcomes in patients presenting after 6 hours (as assessed by comparison of logistic regression models: Akaike information criterion: 199.35 versus 287.49 and Bayesian information criterion: 196.71 versus 283.27) and those with an Alberta Stroke Program Early Computed Tomography Score ≤7 (Akaike information criterion: 216.69 versus 334.96 and Bayesian information criterion: 213.6 versus 329.94).

This is mostly due to fact that the anaesthesiologists work in close contact with patients' airways, and the aerosol-generating nature of some procedures they perform. Fortunately, despite the occupational hazard, the incidence of COVID-19 among anaesthesiologists and intensivists remains relatively low. Current evidence suggests that the majority of SARS-CoV-2 infections in this group were either contracted outside of the work environment or can be attributed to personal protective equipment (PPE) malfunction. This article focuses on different aspects of anaesthesiologists' safety, risks connected with different clinical scenarios and procedures, issues related to testing and screening, as well as modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors for severe illness or from COVID-19. This analysis is accompanied by a review of guidelines dedicated to mitigating said risks.

Although numerous case reports exist, the findings appear heterogenous and providing accurate patient counselling remains challenging. METHODS A systematic literature review was conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidance1 . RESULTS Thirty-one studies including 78 patients were included in this review. No association with maternal or neonatal coagulopathy, infection or trauma was found. The average gestational age at diagnosis was 25 weeks (range 17-34 weeks). Approximately half of foetuses affected were female (48.7%); one quarter were male (25.6%) and one quarter had no sex stated (25.6%). Termination of pregnancy was chosen in 25.6% of cases (20/78). In continuing pregnancies,10.3% (6/58) experienced a perinatal death. Antenatally, the majority of lesions either decreased in size (38.5%) or completely resolved (32.7%). The neonatal or childhood outcome was normal in 88.0% of survivors (44/50). The average age at follow up was 16.4 months, ranging from birth to 6 years. CONCLUSION This review found that ten percent of DST cases experience in-utero or neonatal death. In survivors, the majority of cases reduce in size or completely resolve in pregnancy and 85% are reported to have a good outcome.

However, it is unknown in the lateral decubitus position. We thus compared forced-air warming on the upper and lower bodies in the lateral position. METHODS Patients (n=123) were randomised to receive forced-air warming on the upper body or lower body during thoracoscopic surgery in the lateral position. We measured the nasopharyngeal temperature at 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min after lateral positioning during surgery and the infrared tympanic membrane temperature at 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min after surgery. Patients received both upper and lower body warming at a temperature of <35.5°C. The primary outcome was the incidence of intraoperative hypothermia with a temperature of <36.0°C. RESULTS Intraoperative hypothermia was less frequent with the upper body warming than with the lower body warming {21/62 vs 35/61, risk ratio [95% confidence interval (CI)] 0.6 (0.4-0.9), P=0.011}. The intraoperative temperature was higher with the upper body warming than with the lower body warming at 30 (P=0.002), 60 (P<0.001), and 90 (P<0.001) min after lateral positioning, and the postoperative temperature was higher at 0 (P<0.001) and 30 (P=0.001) min after surgery. Fewer patients received both upper and lower body warming in the upper body warming group than in the lower body warming group during surgery (1 vs 7, P=0.032).

The purpose of this study was to verify the feasibility of using ultrasound to measure the distance between the upper edge of saline-inflated cuff and the vocal cords. DESIGN Prospective case-control study. SETTING A tertiary hospital in Beijing, China. METHODS In this prospective study, 105 adult patients who required general anaesthesia were enrolled. Prior to induction, ultrasound was used to identify the position of the vocal cords. After intubation, the endotracheal tube (ETT) was fixed at a depth of 23 cm at the upper incisors in men and 21 cm in women. The depth of intubation was verified by video-assisted laryngoscopy. The distance between the upper edge of the saline-inflated cuff and the vocal cords was measured by ultrasound; the ideal distance was considered to be 1.9-4.1 cm. RESULTS Among the 105 cases, two cuffs were too close to the vocal cords and one too far away from the vocal cords. These diagnoses were made by ultrasound and were in agreement with results from direct laryngoscopy. The overall accuracy of ultrasound in identifying malposition of the cuff was 100.0% (95% CI: 96.6% to 100%). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of ultrasound were, respectively, 100% (95% CI: 96.5% to 100%), 100% (95% CI: 29.2% to 100%), 100% (95% CI: 96.5% to 100%) and 100% (95% CI: 29.2% to 100%). CONCLUSION Identification of the upper edge of the saline-inflated cuff and the vocal cords by ultrasound to assess the location of the ETT is a reliable method. It can be used to avoid malposition of the ETT cuff and reduce the incidence of vocal cords injury after intubation.

We recently determined the crystal structures of NL63 coronavirus (NL63-CoV) and SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) receptor-binding domains (RBDs), each complexed with their common receptor, human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), and proposed the existence of a virus-binding hot spot on hACE2. Here we investigated the function of this hypothetical hot spot using structure-guided biochemical and functional assays. The hot spot consists of a salt bridge surrounded by hydrophobic tunnel walls. Mutations that disturb the hot spot structure have significant effects on virus/receptor interactions, revealing critical energy contributions from the hot spot structure. The tunnel structure at the NL63-CoV/hACE2 interface is more compact than that at the SARS-CoV/hACE2 interface, and hence RBD/hACE2 binding affinities are decreased either by NL63-CoV mutations decreasing the tunnel space or by SARS-CoV mutations increasing the tunnel space. Furthermore, NL63-CoV RBD inhibits hACE2-dependent transduction by SARS-CoV spike protein, a successful application of the hot spot theory that has the potential to become a new antiviral strategy against SARS-CoV infections. These results suggest that the structural features of the hot spot on hACE2 were among the driving forces for the convergent evolution of NL63-CoV and SARS-CoV.","Wu, Kailang; Chen, Lang; Peng, Guiqing; Zhou, Wenbo; Pennell, Christopher A; Mansky, Louis M; Geraghty, Robert J; Li, Fang",Journal of virology,479,1

METHODS A systematic literature search was performed across several databases (PsycINFO, PubMed, Embase) and reference lists of included studies. RESULTS Twenty studies were included across two independent meta-analyses, with 7373 participants. Random effects meta-analyses showed that there was a positive correlation between health anxiety and online health information seeking [r = 0.34, 95% CI (0.20, 0.48), p < .0001], and between health anxiety and cyberchondria [r = 0.62, 95% CI (0.52, 0.71), p < .0001]. A meta-regression indicated that the age of study participants [Q(1) = 4.58, p = .03] was partly responsible for the heterogeneity found for the relationship between health anxiety and cyberchondria.

We therefore tested the primary hypothesis that perioperative IV lidocaine and/or ketamine in patients undergoing open abdominal hysterectomy improves rehabilitation as measured by a 6-minute walk distance (6-MWD) on the second postoperative morning. METHODS Women having open hysterectomy were anesthetized with sevoflurane, followed by patient-controlled morphine. Patients were factorially randomized to one of the following groups: (1) lidocaine and placebo, (2) placebo and ketamine, (3) placebo and placebo, or (4) lidocaine and ketamine. Lidocaine was given as a bolus (1.5 mg/kg), followed by lidocaine infusion of 2 mg/kg/h for the first 2 hours, and then 1.2 mg/kg/h for 24 postoperative hours. Ketamine was given as a bolus (0.35 mg/kg), followed by ketamine infusion of 0.2 mg/kg/h for the first 2 hours, and then 0.12 mg/kg/h for 24 postoperative hours. The primary double-blind outcome was 6-MWD on the second postoperative morning; secondary outcomes included pain scores, opioid consumption, postoperative nausea and vomiting, and fatigue score. RESULTS The study was stopped after a planned interim analysis of 64 patients showed that lidocaine crossed the preplanned futility boundary, with mean ± SD of 202 ± 66 m versus 202 ± 73 m for lidocaine versus placebo, respectively, and mean difference (interim adjusted 97.5% confidence interval) of 0.93 m (-52, 54) (P = 0.96); the ketamine effect also crossed the futility boundary, with mean ± SD of 193 ± 77 m versus 210 ± 61 m for ketamine versus placebo, respectively, and mean difference (interim adjusted 97.5% confidence interval) of -11 m (-65, 44) (P = 0.54). No interaction between the 2 intervention effects was observed (P = 0.96). Neither intervention significantly influenced any of the secondary outcomes. CONCLUSION Our results do not support use of lidocaine or ketamine for improving 6-MWD on the second postoperative day after open hysterectomy.","Grady, Martin V; Mascha, Edward; Sessler, Daniel I; Kurz, Andrea",Anesthesia and analgesia,479,1

This study investigates a new method for reducing anastomotic failure using antitraction sutures. METHODS In 2007, the authors began routine placement of three sutures at every one-third of the circular end-to-end anastomosis to reduce traction. Before the start of the new protocol, 76 patients received laparoscopic colorectal left sided surgery, 21 (28%) of whom received a defunctioning stoma. After the start of the new protocol, 77 patients received laparoscopic colorectal surgery, 6 (8%) of whom received a defunctioning stoma. RESULTS Placement of a defunctioning stoma was significantly reduced (n = 21 vs. 6; P = 0.01). Only one patient (1%) in the sutured group experienced anastomotic leakage compared with six patients in the control group (P = 0.025). Other anastomosis-related complications during the follow-up period, including anastomotic stenosis and intraabdominal abscess, occurred more frequently in the control group, although the difference did not reach significance. CONCLUSION The use of antitraction sutures to support the anastomosis seems to reduce the occurrence of anastomotic leakage in laparoscopic left colorectal surgery. A prospective randomized trial is necessary to prove the decreasing effect of antitraction sutures on anastomotic leakage as well as the major decreasing effect on the necessity of placement of defunctioning stomas.","Gadiot, Ralph P M; Dunker, Michalda S; Mearadji, Amir; Mannaerts, Guido H H",Surgical endoscopy,479,0

Amongst the neuronal CaV2 channel family, CaV2.2 is of particular importance due to its general role for signal transmission from the periphery to the central nervous system, but also due to its significance for pain perception. Thus, CaV2.2 is an ideal target candidate to search for pharmacological inhibitors but also for novel modulatory interactors. In this review we summarize the last years findings of our intense screenings and characterization of the six CaV2.2 interaction partners, tetraspanin-13 (TSPAN-13), reticulon 1 (RTN1), member 1 of solute carrier family 38 (SLC38), prostaglandin D2 synthase (PTGDS), transmembrane protein 223 (TMEM223) and transmembrane BAX inhibitor motif 3 (Grina/TMBIM3) containing protein. Each protein shows a unique way of channel modulation as shown by extensive electrophysiological studies. Amongst the newly identified interactors, Grina/TMBIM3 is most striking due to its modulatory effect which is rather comparable to G-protein regulation.","Lacinova, Lubica; Mallmann, Robert Theodor; Jurkovičová-Tarabová, Bohumila; Klugbauer, Norbert",Channels,479,7

Probing the host factors contributing to disease severity, we found that lower levels of plasma inflammatory cytokines on hospital admission correlated with faster recovery in 18 patients with A/H7N9 influenza virus, whereas high concentrations of (in particular) IL-6, IL-8, and macrophage inflammatory protein-1β were predictive of a less favorable or fatal outcome. Analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage samples showed up to 1,000-fold greater cytokine/chemokine levels relative to plasma. Furthermore, patients with the rs12252-C/C IFN-induced transmembrane protein-3 (IFITM3) genotype had more rapid disease progression and were less likely to survive. Compared with patients with the rs12252-T/T or rs12252-T/C genotype of IFITM3, patients with the C/C genotype had a shorter time from disease onset to the time point when they sought medical aid (hospital admission or antiviral therapy) and a shorter interval to development of the acute respiratory distress syndrome stage (reflected by shorter intervals between clinical onset and methylprednisolone treatments and higher rates of mechanical ventilator use), as well as experiencing elevated/prolonged lung virus titers and cytokine production and higher mortality. The present analysis provides reported data on the H7N9 influenza-induced ""cytokine storm"" at the site of infection in humans and identifies the rs12252-C genotype that compromises IFITM3 function as a primary genetic correlate of severe H7N9 pneumonia. Together with rs12252 sequencing, early monitoring of plasma cytokines is thus of prognostic value for the treatment and management of severe influenza pneumonia.","Wang, Zhongfang; Zhang, Anli; Wan, Yanmin; Liu, Xinian; Qiu, Chao; Xi, Xiuhong; Ren, Yanqin; Wang, Jing; Dong, Yuan; Bao, Meijuan; Li, Liangzhu; Zhou, Mingzhe; Yuan, Songhua; Sun, Jun; Zhu, Zhaoqin; Chen, Liang; Li, Qingsheng; Zhang, Zhiyong; Zhang, Xiaoyan; Lu, Shuihua; Doherty, Peter C; Kedzierska, Katherine; Xu, Jianqing",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,479,5

We model the interaction in 58 human cell lines, where IFN-γ in vitro exposure leads to a conserved transcriptome response unless cells have IFN-γ receptor alterations. This conserved IFN-γ transcriptome response in melanoma cells serves to amplify the antitumor immune response. Therefore, the magnitude of the antitumor T cell response and the corresponding downstream IFN-γ signaling are the main drivers of clinical response or resistance to immune checkpoint blockade therapy.","Grasso, Catherine S; Tsoi, Jennifer; Onyshchenko, Mykola; Abril-Rodriguez, Gabriel; Ross-Macdonald, Petra; Wind-Rotolo, Megan; Champhekar, Ameya; Medina, Egmidio; Torrejon, Davis Y; Shin, Daniel Sanghoon; Tran, Phuong; Kim, Yeon Joo; Puig-Saus, Cristina; Campbell, Katie; Vega-Crespo, Agustin; Quist, Michael; Martignier, Christophe; Luke, Jason J; Wolchok, Jedd D; Johnson, Douglas B; Chmielowski, Bartosz; Hodi, F Stephen; Bhatia, Shailender; Sharfman, William; Urba, Walter J; Slingluff, Craig L; Diab, Adi; Haanen, John B A G; Algarra, Salvador Martin; Pardoll, Drew M; Anagnostou, Valsamo; Topalian, Suzanne L; Velculescu, Victor E; Speiser, Daniel E; Kalbasi, Anusha; Ribas, Antoni",Cancer cell,479,16

A growing number of studies are utilizing randomized controlled trials (RCT) to examine whether responsive parenting interventions lead to positive gains in children's academic readiness. A synthesis of the extant literature is warranted to gain a precise estimate of the causal influence of responsive parenting on academic readiness, as well as to examine moderators that may serve to strengthen or weaken this effect. The main objective of this study will be to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs evaluating the use of responsive parenting interventions to target academic readiness: problem-solving/reasoning, language proficiency, executive functioning, and pre-academic skills (e.g., numeracy/literacy). METHODS Studies that took place in the early childhood period (< 6 years at baseline), targeted responsive parenting behaviours using an RCT (with control group, waitlist, or treatment as usual as a comparator), and included an outcome assessment of academic readiness will be considered for eligibility. Children and/or parents with special needs and/or disabilities will be excluded. The primary outcome is the effect of responsive parenting interventions on academic readiness. Secondary outcomes include substantive and methodological moderators and parent-mediated effects on outcomes. We will search MEDLINE, PsycINFO, ERIC, and ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global databases from their inception onwards and we will also conduct backward/forward searching of eligible studies. Published and unpublished works will be considered. Screening, full-text assessments, and data extraction will be completed by two independent reviewers. Risk of bias will be assessed using the CLARITY tool for RCTs. Effect sizes will be calculated based on study-level standardized differences between experimental and control groups and entered into random effects models to obtain a pooled effect (meta-analysis). Moderation will be examined through Q-statistics and meta-regression to study sources of between-study variation in effect sizes. A pooled path model of mediation will be used to study parent-mediated effects. DISCUSSION Findings will illuminate causal relations between responsive parenting and academic readiness, with implications for developmental science. Findings will also guide decision making in policy and practice for supporting early childhood development and reducing social disparities in children prior to school-entry.

METHODS Forty patients with mediastinal tumors were treated with single-port thoracoscopic mediastinal resection at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital between April 2014 and September 2015. The surgical intervention was performed through the fourth or fifth intercostal space at the anterior axillary line. A 5 or 10 mm 30 degree video camera and working instruments were employed simultaneously at this incision site throughout the surgery. RESULTS Among the 40 cases included in the final analysis, 10 extended thymectomies, 7 limited thymectomies, nine cyst excisions and 14 tumor excisions were performed successfully without the need for conversion. For the 40 patients who underwent single-port video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS), the mean operation time was 97.3±31.2 min and the average blood loss was 29.75±39.77 mL.

This study was designed to detect the influences and regulatory mechanism of lncRNA PDCD4-AS1 in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). METHODS qRT-PCR and Western blot were utilized to investigate the expression levels of PDCD4-AS1, miR-10b-5p and IQGAP2 in TNBC tissues and cells. Online software and luciferase reporter gene system were employed to testify the interactions among these molecules. Loss and gain of function of PDCD4-AS1, miR-10b-5p or IQGAP2 were performed before MTT and colony formation assay, TUNEL staining in addition to Transwell and scratch assays were applied to measure the cell biological functions. RESULTS In this work, PDCD4-AS1 and IQGAP2 were lowly expressed while miR-10b-5p was strongly expressed in TNBC tissues and cells. PDCD4-AS1 or IQGAP2 overexpression effectively attenuated TNBC cell proliferation, migration and invasion, and increased the apoptosis rate, while this effect was abandoned in response to miR-10b-5p mimics transfection. miR-10b-5p bound to IQGAP2 and acted as a downstream target of PDCD4-AS1. CONCLUSION Our findings identified lncRNA PDCD4-AS1 as a tumor suppressor in TNBC by regulating IQGAP2 expression via miR-10b-5p, giving a novel insight into the regulatory mechanism of PDCD4-AS1 in the pathogenesis of TNBC.","Wang, Daoliang; Wang, Zhuo; Zhang, Lijun; Sun, Shengrong",Translational oncology,479,1

Breast lesion localization is moving away from the traditional wire technique, which requires an on-site radiologist to support theater scheduling. In North Wales, the introduction of Magseed for impalpable breast lesion localization has facilitated theater scheduling in the absence of same day radiology presence. We audited our first 200 Magseed cases to assess the safety and efficacy of the technique, the ease of use, and patient experience. Data were entered prospectively into an excel data base relating to Magseed cases. Data collected included demographics, pre and postoperative lesion size, histology, margin positivity, and re-excision rates. Data were submitted in real time by the radiologist performing Magseed insertion to ascertain degree of difficulty. A PROMS questionnaire was designed and sent to patients undergoing Magseed vs wire localizations. Two hundred patients underwent Magseed-guided wide local excision between May 2018 and January 2020 across 2 district general hospital sites in North Wales. Histology: 69% IDC, 20% ILC, and 11% others. Mean preoperative size 12.3 mm, postoperative size 19 mm. Re-excision rate 15%. Re-excision for DCIS was significantly more likely than for invasive disease (p < 0.0001). A significant difference was also observed between radiological mean preoperative tumor size estimate and actual histological tumor size in patients undergoing margin re-excision (p = 0.000019). Wire-guided re-excision rate was 21% in the same unit. PROMs found the procedure well tolerated by patients. Surgeons and radiologists reported Magseed to be user-friendly with minimal learning curve. Magseed use for impalpable breast lesion localization is safe, user friendly, and well tolerated by patients. It produces favorable re-excision rates when compared to published figures for wire-guided excision. The presence of DCIS and preoperative radiological size underestimation was associated with margin re-excision.","Powell, Meena; Gate, Tim; Kalake, Onneile; Ranjith, Carmen; Pennick, Mandana O",The breast journal,479,11

Perinephric abscess presenting as rash.,20.730785,8.10147,2010,"Background Neoadjuvant therapy followed by esophagectomy has been recognized as an effective treatment for locally advanced esophageal cancer, though still has a dismal prognosis. Antibodies against programmed death 1 (PD-1) protein improve survival in patients with advanced or metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) compared with chemotherapy in second-line therapy. However, neoadjuvant PD-1 inhibitor combined with chemotherapy has not been tested in locally advanced ESCC. We conducted this study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pd-1 inhibitor in neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Methods In this study, we administered 28 adults with untreated, surgically resectable locally advanced ESCC. PD-1 inhibitor with chemotherapy [albumin paclitaxel 100 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8 + carboplatin with an area under the curve (AUC) of 5 on day 1] were administered every 3 weeks intravenously, and surgery was performed approximately 3-5 weeks after the second dose. The primary purpose of the study was to evaluate the feasibility and safety of this regimen. Results In all, 28 locally advanced ESCC patients were enrolled, 27 patients received surgery, 9 (33.3%) patients' postoperative pathological specimens suggested pCR, and 11 (40.7%) patients' primary tumor suggested complete response. Neoadjuvant PD-1 inhibitor with chemotherapy had an acceptable side-effect profile, 26 patients' tumors were completely resected (96.3% were R0). According to the RESIST v.1.1, the response in all 27 patients was evaluated by a computed tomography (CT) scan before surgery, showing 12 patients with complete response (CR), 12 with partial response (PR), and 3 with stable disease (SD). For surgical procedures, 15 (55.6%) patients underwent minimal invasive surgery, 4 (14.8%) underwent right transthoracic open esophagectomy, and 8 (29.6%) underwent hybrid approaches. Conclusions The novel treatment of PD-1 inhibitor with chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting for locally advanced ESCC produced satisfactory outcomes: an unprecedentedly high pCR rate for neoadjuvant chemotherapy, a high R0 resection rate, and a low-toxicity profile were achieved. The long-term efficiency of this novel treatment and the validity of the present findings should be confirmed with longer follow-up and prospective comparative trials.","Shen, Dijian; Chen, Qixun; Wu, Jie; Li, Jianqiang; Tao, Kaiyi; Jiang, Youhua",Journal of gastrointestinal oncology,479,2

However, the yield of a 25G Franseen needle when acquiring histological core tissue has been unclear. Patients and Methods We performed a prospective, multicenter, and observational cohort study that included 100 solid lesions scheduled for EUS-FNB using a 25G Franseen needle at eight centers in Hokkaido, Japan. Only EUS-FNB specimens acquired at the first pass were evaluated without a rapid on-site evaluation. The tissue acquisition rate, acquisition rate of an adequate specimen for histological assessment, the quality of tissue sample, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), diagnostic accuracy, and adverse events were evaluated. Results We analyzed a total of 100 solid lesions in 100 patients. The patients were 57 males and 43 females with a median age of 70 years. The technical success rate was 100%. The tissue acquisition rate was 95.0%. The acquisition rate of an adequate specimen for histological assessment was 82.0%. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and diagnostic accuracy were 87.0%, 100%, 100%, 40.0%, and 88.0%, respectively.

The virulent nature of the virus makes it necessary for us to identify promising therapeutic agents in a time-sensitive manner. The current study utilises an in silico based drug repurposing approach to identify potential anti-viral drug candidates targeting non-structural protein 15 (NSP15), i.e. a uridylate specific endoribonuclease of SARS-CoV-2 which plays an indispensable role in RNA processing and viral immune evasion from the host immune system. The NSP15 protein was screened against an in-house library of 123 antiviral drugs obtained from the DrugBank database from which three promising drug candidates were identified based on their estimated binding affinities (ΔG), estimated inhibition constants (Ki), the orientation of drug molecules in the active site and the key interacting residues of NSP15. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed for the screened drug candidates in complex with NSP15 as well as the apo form of NSP15 to mimic their physiological states. Based on the stable MD simulation trajectories, the binding free energies of the screened NSP15-drug complexes were calculated using the MM/PBSA approach. Two candidate drugs, Simeprevir and Paritaprevir, achieved the lowest binding free energies for NSP15, with a value of -259.522 ± 17.579 and -154.051 ± 33.628 kJ/mol, respectively. In addition, their complexes with NSP15 also exhibited the strongest structural stabilities. Taken together, we propose that Simeprevir and Paritaprevir are promising drug candidates to inhibit NSP15 and may act as potential therapeutic agents against SARS-CoV-2. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) is associated with LSCC and can impact its prognosis. Local factors, particularly pH, can affect cancer growth by altering TIME and tumor associated macrophages phenotype. However, it is still unknown whether and how LPR affects TIME and macrophages polarization in LSCC. In this study we compared macrophage polarization in LSCC of patients with and without coexisting LPR. Methods A total of 63 patients with T1-2 LSCC without (the 1st group, 30 patients) and with coexisting LPR (the 2nd group, 33 patients) were enrolled in the study. Only HPV-negative cases of males were included in the study. Immunohistochemistry was performed to visualize CD68 and CD163 macrophages. The number of macrophages was counted at the central tumor clusters (TC), peritumor stroma (TS) and at the intact laryngeal mucosa (IM) taken from the tumor-negative edge. Results Samples of the 2nd group patients with LSCC and LPR demonstrated significantly (P<0.05) higher inflammatory infiltration of all the evaluated compartments (TC, TS and IM). CD68+ cells count was comparable in TC and IM of the 1st and the 2nd group patients. In contrast, CD163+ cells were more numerous in the 2nd group patients in TC, TS and IM (P<0.001). Moreover, the number of M2 macrophages was significantly higher than M1 macrophages in patients with coexisting LPR. As a result, CD163/CD68 ratio was significantly (P<0.001) higher in LSCC with coexisting LPR. Conclusion LPR is associated with altered macrophages polarization and increase of M2-type macrophages in LSCC. The shift in macrophage polarization towards the M2 type in patients with LPR could facilitate LSCC development and progression.","Zabolotnyi, Dmytro; Kizim, Yaroslav; Zabolotna, Diana; Sulaieva, Oksana; Kizim, Volodymyr",Clinical and experimental otorhinolaryngology,479,16

This has prompted the emergence of critical just-in-time COVID-19 education, including rapid simulation preparedness, evaluation and training across all healthcare sectors. Simulation has been proven to be pivotal for both healthcare provider learning and systems integration in the context of testing and integrating new processes, workflows, and rapid changes to practice (e.g., new cognitive aids, checklists, protocols) and changes to the delivery of clinical care. The individual, team, and systems learnings generated from proactive simulation training is occurring at unprecedented volume and speed in our healthcare system. Establishing a clear process to collect and report simulation outcomes has never been more important for staff and patient safety to reduce preventable harm. Our provincial simulation program in the province of Alberta, Canada (population = 4.37 million; geographic area = 661,848 km2), has rapidly responded to this need by leading the intake, design, development, planning, and co-facilitation of over 400 acute care simulations across our province in both urban and rural Emergency Departments, Intensive Care Units, Operating Rooms, Labor and Delivery Units, Urgent Care Centers, Diagnostic Imaging and In-patient Units over a 5-week period to an estimated 30,000 learners of real frontline team members. Unfortunately, the speed at which the COVID-19 pandemic has emerged in Canada may prevent healthcare sectors in both urban and rural settings to have an opportunity for healthcare teams to participate in just-in-time in situ simulation-based learning prior to a potential surge of COVID-19 patients. Our coordinated approach and infrastructure have enabled organizational learnings and the ability to theme and categorize a mass volume of simulation outcome data, primarily from acute care settings to help all sectors further anticipate and plan. The goal of this paper is to share the unique features and advantages of using a centralized provincial simulation response team, preparedness using learning and systems integration methods, and to share the highest risk and highest frequency outcomes from analyzing a mass volume of COVID-19 simulation data across the largest health authority in Canada.","Dubé, Mirette; Kaba, Alyshah; Cronin, Theresa; Barnes, Sue; Fuselli, Tara; Grant, Vincent",Advances in simulation,479,1

We conducted a cadaveric randomized crossover study to compare the novice learning curves for multiport laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) and single incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SILC), and to investigate the acquisition of transferable skills. PARTICIPANTS Twenty medical students were randomized into SILS or LC groups. METHODS After baseline assessment and cognitive learning modules, groups completed 5 cadaveric porcine cholecystectomies in their designated modality, followed by one using the other approach. Performance was assessed using a validated surgical assessment device (ICSAD) and by expert video analysis with generic and procedure-specific rating scales [modified global rating scale (mGRS) and procedure-specific rating scales (PSRS)]. RESULTS Analysis of the first case revealed significant differences between LC and SILS groups for time-taken (median 46.00 vs 68.19 min, p = 0.019), and path length (216 vs 348 m, p = 0.034). Intergroup analysis of the remaining group cases showed no difference for any of the performance metrics. Outlying performance of the 4th case in the LC group rendered learning curve comparison unviable. At crossover, performance of the SILS group on their LC compared with the 5th LC performed by the LC group showed no significant difference. However, comparing the LC group's SILC to the 5th SILC performed by the SILS group showed significant difference for all performance metrics (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS This study suggests that the difference between novice performance for SILC and LC becomes negligible after the first procedure. Furthermore, dedicated SILC training appears to develop competencies for both SILC and LC, therefore its addition to the early surgical curriculum is likely to extend the access of SILC to patients without reducing multiport laparoscopic skill acquisition.","Kwasnicki, Richard M; Aggarwal, Rajesh; Lewis, Trystan M; Purkayastha, Sanjay; Darzi, Ara; Paraskeva, Paraskevas A",Journal of surgical education,479,1

The PENG block is a novel motor- and opioid-sparing technique, which offers long-lasting analgesia and requires less volume than other blocks. In all of the cases in this series, the blocks were performed successfully in a short period of time, without complication. All patients reported a clinically important reduction in pain scores. Patients with hip fracture are often medically complex, and while early surgery is not always possible, pain management should be addressed from an early point in their hospital admission.

We identified up to a 10,480-fold higher expression of viral attachment factors AXL, GAS6, and PROS1 and a 3880-fold increase in ZIKV infectiousness/propagation in human term decidual stromal cells versus trophoblasts. Moreover, levels of viral attachment factors and ZIKV are significantly increased, whereas expression of innate immune response genes are significantly decreased, in human first trimester versus term decidual cells. ZIKV-infected decidual cell supernatants increased cytotrophoblasts infection up to 252-fold compared with directly infected cytotrophoblasts. Tizoxanide treatment efficiently inhibited Zika infection in both maternal and fetal cells. We conclude that ZIKV permissiveness, as well as innate immune responsiveness of human decidual cells, are gestational age dependent, and decidual cells augment ZIKV infection of primary human cytotrophoblast cultures, which are otherwise ZIKV resistant. Human decidual cells may act as reservoirs for trimester-dependent placental transmission of ZIKV, accounting for the higher Zika infection susceptibility and more severe fetal sequelae observed in early versus late pregnancy.

The COVID-19 pandemic has led to an enormous increase in patients with respiratory symptoms. Nurse competence is essential for ensuring quality treatment and care for these patients; however, research on nursing strategies for patients with respiratory insufficiency is limited. AIM This study explored nurses' perspectives on and nursing strategies in patients with respiratory insufficiency when admitted to three different intensive care units. DESIGN The study had an exploratory, descriptive, qualitative design. METHODS Four focus group interviews with a total of 20 nurses, critical care nurses, and critical care nursing students were conducted. Data were analysed using content analysis. RESULTS Participants' perspectives fell into two main themes: ""nurse competence"" and ""the art of balancing."" ""Nurse competence"" incorporated the sub-themes ""observations and assessments,"" ""to make decisions,"" and ""collaboration."" The theme 'the art of balancing' incorporated the sub-themes ""nursing interventions,"" ""patients feeling safe,"" and ""patient participation."" CONCLUSION This study contributes new knowledge about nurses' perspectives on patients with respiratory insufficiency. Nurse competence was assumed essential to observe, assess, and treat patients with respiratory insufficiency. Nursing strategies included balancing nursing interventions, conducting medical treatment, and taking a whole-person approach to patients' needs. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE The COVID-19 pandemic has shown the need for nurse competence in caring for patients with respiratory insufficiency. This study adds to existing literature emphasizing the need for competence in health care services. Caring for patients with respiratory insufficiency requires nurses with experience; competence in observation, assessment, and medical treatment; and a whole-person approach to patients' needs.","Leonardsen, Ann-Chatrin; Gulbrandsen, Tove; Wasenius, Catrin; Fossen, Linn Therese",Nursing in critical care,479,16

Our investigation aims to evaluate the impact of the pandemic on the home duties and workplace productivity of academic radiologists with respect to gender. MATERIALS AND METHODS A 49-question survey was distributed to 926 members of Association of University Radiologists in October 2020. Several categories were addressed: demographics; workplace changes; stress levels and personal experiences with illness; time spent on domestic obligations; and perception of productivity during COVID-19. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4 software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). RESULTS A total of 96 responses across 30 states, 53.1% male and 46.9% female were received. Women report spending more time on unpaid domestic duties than men prior to COVID-19, with men spending a median of 5-10 h/wk and women spending a median of 10-15 h/wk (p = 0.043). With pandemic onset, both genders reported that women did more of the homecare, when not split equally. Women with young children reported a significant decrease in work-from-home productivity compared to men with young children (p = 0.007). Men reported they had more time to be productive compared to women (p = 0.012). CONCLUSION The COVID-19 pandemic threatens to disrupt the advancement of women in radiology leadership roles by creating disparate effects on productivity due to increased workloads at home for women. This could potentially lead to decreases in promotions and research productivity in years to come that far outlast the acute phases of the pandemic.","Plaunova, Anastasia; Heller, Samantha L; Babb, James S; Heffernan, Cathleen C",Academic radiology,479,1

METHODS A retrospective analysis of patients undergoing IPV injection at two centres between 2015-2018 was conducted. Demographics, CEAP classification and IPV location were collected. Outcomes were assessed at two follow-up appointments. RESULTS A total of 83 perforator vein injections were completed. CEAP classifications include C2 - C6 classes. Location of perforators were posteromedial (6%), femoral canal (9%), paratibial (14%), and posterior-tibial (71%). IPV closure rates were 96.3% at initial follow-up (16 ± 2 days). Closure rates decreased to 86.5% at second follow-up (72 ± 9 days). There were no deep vein thromboses during follow-up. One patient developed septic thrombophlebitis that was successfully managed with antibiotics.

PVP at different concentrations were used to treat different groups of fibroblasts from TAO patients and normal persons. Dexamethasone (Dex) was used as a positive control drug, and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) was used as a positive stimulant. The effects of PVP on the proliferation of orbital fibroblasts, the secretion of hyaluronic acid (HA), the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1/CD54) and apoptosis in orbital fibroblasts were determined. The experimental results showed when the concentration of PVP was greater than 400 μg/mL, it could significantly inhibit the proliferation of orbital fibroblasts from patients with TAO (P < 0.05). However, no definite inhibitory effect was observed in the orbital fibroblasts from the normal people. Dex could significantly inhibit the proliferation of orbital fibroblasts from patients with TAO and the normal people (P < 0.05). In contrast, every concentration of IFN-γ could promote the orbital fibroblasts from patients with TAO and the normal people proliferation. No groups had statistically significant stimulatory effect on HA secretion by orbital fibroblasts from normal people (P > 0.05). But the Dex group, IFN-γ+PVP-1600 group and IFN-γ+Dex group could significantly inhibit the secretion of HA from orbital fibroblasts of TAO patients. And there were no groups had statistically significant stimulatory effect on the expression of ICAM-1/CD54 in orbital fibroblasts from TAO patients (P > 0.05). PVP and Dex at all concentrations could significantly promote orbital fibroblast co-cultured with IFN-γ apoptosis (P < 0.05). But without IFN-γ, PVP and Dex at all concentrations could only significantly promote orbital fibroblast from TAO patients apoptosis (P < 0.05). These results suggest that PVP exerts its therapeutic effect by inhibiting the proliferation of orbital fibroblasts and promoting the apoptosis of orbital fibroblasts in TAO patients. In addition, in this process, HA secretion is suppressed. But the participation of IFN-γ is required. This effect is similar to that of Dex. And in the MTT experiment, the efficacy of PVP showed selectivity for TAO patients. This is different from Dex. This may be a feature of PVP that deserves attention.","Li, Bei; Guo, Jinlin; Wang, Fang; Cheng, Shuanghua; Zeng, Liuzhi",Experimental eye research,479,31

In this report, we firstly presented a patient with mild COVID-19 disease who developed paracentral acute middle maculopathy (PAMM) due to CRAO. CASE PRESENTATION A 54-year-old male patient who reported a contact with a COVID-19 patient applied to the hospital and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by polimerase chain reaction testing. He had no significant past medical history. Chest computed tomography was not notable. He had a mild COVID-19 course during hospitalization. Two weeks following COVID-19 diagnosis, he reported profund vision loss (counting fingers) in his right eye where central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) was detected on fundoscopic examination. Coagulation profile was within normal limits. Hypercoagulable work up was also not notable. Treatment was given for CRAO. Visual acuity was counting fingers at 30 cm. Five days following treatment. Optical coherence tomography analysis showed increased diffuse reflectance and thickening at the level of inner nuclear layer consistent with PAMM. Fluorescein angiography illustrated no perfusion defect. CONCLUSION This is the first case that reports PAMM in the setting of CRAO following COVID-19 diagnosis. Viral induced microangiopathy may involve in the development of CRAO in our patient without a hypercoagulable state and additional risk factors. Physicians should be vigilant to seek for retinal evaluation in patients with significant visual loss even after a mild COVID-19 history.","Turedi, Neslihan; Onal Gunay, Betul",European journal of ophthalmology,479,1

RECENT FINDINGS The rise of the COVID-19 virus saw a dramatic reduction in elective surgery and outpatient services with a subsequent reduction in experiential learning for trainees. This has spurred the rising trend to maintain the mission of education and clinical service, virtually. There have been unprecedented levels of international collaboration in the 'pandemic year of 2020' that has seen various platforms conceived to harmonize varying practices from global experts towards the ultimate goal of education propagation and improved patient care. The continent of Africa, amidst its own unique challenges, has boldly stepped into the virtual realm in form of a resident-centred platform coined University Of Cape Town-Africa Virtual ENT, and two multidisciplinary team (MDT) meetings: the African Head and Neck Society Virtual Tumour Board and the African Virtual Cochlear Implant Meeting. SUMMARY The COVID-19 pandemic will have long-lasting effects on clinical practice and training programs globally. This has demanded academicians to re-imagine novel ways to buoy academia and maintain international collaboration in an inexpensive and convenient way to nourish the sacred mission of education and clinical service within our spirited continent.","Din, Taseer F; Macharia, Chege; Harris, Tashneem",Current opinion in otolaryngology & head and neck surgery,479,1

DESIGN Cross-sectional study with a representative sample (development) and a case-control sample (validation). SETTING The two largest Swiss prisons. PARTICIPANTS (1) Development sample: all male persons detained in Pöschwies, Zurich (n = 365); (2) Validation sample: case-control sample of male persons detained in Champ-Dollon, Geneva (n = 192, matching 1:3 for participants at risk for severe course of COVID-19 and participants without risk factors). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The CIRA combined seven risk factors identified by the World Health Organization and the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health as predictive of severe COVID-19 to derive an absolute risk increase in mortality rate: Age ≥60 years, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension, chronic respiratory disease, immunodeficiency and cancer. RESULTS Based on the development sample, we proposed a three-level classification: average (<3.7), elevated (3.7-5.7) and high (>5.7) risk. In the validation sample, the CIRA identified all individuals identified as vulnerable by national recommendations (having at least one risk factor). The category “elevated risk” maximised sensitivity (1) and specificity (0.97). The CIRA had even higher capacity in discriminating individuals vulnerable according to clinical evaluation (a four-level risk categorisation based on a consensus of medical staff). The category “elevated risk” maximised sensitivity and specificity (both 1). When considering the individuals classified as extremely high risk by medical staff, the category “high risk” had a high discriminatory capacity (sensitivity =0.89, specificity =0.97). CONCLUSIONS The CIRA scores have a high discriminative ability and will be important in custodial settings to support decisions and prioritise actions using a standardised valid assessment method. However, as knowledge on risk factors for COVID-19 mortality is still limited, the CIRA may be considered preliminary. Underlying data will be updated regularly on the website (http://www.prison-research.com), where the CIRA algorithm is freely available.","Gonçalves, Leonel Cunha; Baggio, Stéphanie; Weber, Michael; Gétaz, Laurent; Wolff, Hans; Singh, Jay; Naegeli, Andreas; Rossegger, Astrid; Endrass, Jérôme",Swiss medical weekly,479,1

Methods Pediatric medical staff (n=534) from nine hospitals in Jiangsu province were enrolled. Their anxiety levels and quality of sleep were assessed using the online SAS and PSQI questionnaires. Results The prevalence of anxiety was 14.0% among the medical staff. In children's hospital staff, anxiety levels in outpatient and emergency departments were significantly higher than those in inpatient departments, except for the intensive care unit. The SAS scores were significantly associated with educational background, professional title, lifestyle, and physical condition. Stepwise multiple linear regression showed that physical condition, lifestyle, attention to the epidemic, professional title, and educational background all had a linear relationship with the individual's anxiety levels. Pearson correlation analysis showed that sleep quality was moderately associated with anxiety levels. Conclusions The prevalence of anxiety was 14.0% in pediatric medical staff in Jiangsu province during an outbreak of COVID-19. Department, professional title, and educational background were associated with anxiety levels in these workers. More attention should be paid to staff who are in poor health, and this anxiety can also be accompanied by poor sleep quality. Peer support can assist with anxiety relief.","Cheng, Fang-Fang; Zhan, Shi-Hong; Xie, An-Wei; Cai, Shi-Zhong; Hui, Li; Kong, Xiao-Xing; Tian, Jian-Mei; Yan, Wen-Hua",Translational pediatrics,479,8

The most common species causing pulmonary disease are members of Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC). MAC pulmonary disease (MAC-PD) can be chronic, debilitating, costly, and associated with a high mortality. However, MAC diagnoses are often delayed due to the nonspecific presentation of MAC-PD and radiological findings that overlap with other pulmonary diseases. Patients with risk factors and who meet the diagnostic criteria-which include clinical, radiological, and microbiologic criteria-should be considered for treatment. Diagnosis requires 2 or more positive sputum cultures or 1 bronchoscopic specimen culture. The recommendation for those who are treated is a 3-drug regimen including macrolide, rifamycin, and ethambutol that is continued for 12 months beyond sputum culture conversion to negative. MAC-PD is difficult to treat, with frequent drug-related side effects and suboptimal treatment outcomes. Refractory and recurrent disease is common, leading to lifelong follow-up of patients. There are limited treatment options for patients with macrolide-resistant or refractory disease. Amikacin liposome inhalation suspension is recommended for treatment-refractory patients whose cultures remain positive after 6 months of guideline-based therapy. Among the research priorities to improve patient outcomes and quality of life are developing new, more rapid diagnostic tests, investigating biomarkers associated with disease progression, and identifying new drugs and routes of administration as well as new, shorter, and better-tolerated regimens.","Daley, Charles L; Winthrop, Kevin L",The Journal of infectious diseases,479,2

Both the World Health Organization and the United Nations consider prevention of PTB as central to improving health care for pregnant women and newborn babies. Current preventative clinical strategies show varied efficacy in different populations of pregnant women, frustrating women and health providers alike, while researchers call for better understanding of the underlying mechanisms that lead to PTB. OBJECTIVES We aimed to summarise all evidence for interventions relevant to the prevention of PTB as reported in Cochrane systematic reviews (SRs). We intended to highlight promising interventions and to identify SRs in need of an update. METHODS We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2 November 2017) with key words to capture any Cochrane SR that prespecified or reported a PTB outcome. Inclusion criteria focused on pregnant women without signs of preterm labour or ruptured amniotic membranes. We included reviews of interventions for pregnant women irrespective of their risk status. We followed standard Cochrane methods.We applied GRADE criteria to evaluate the quality of SR evidence. We assigned graphic icons to classify the effectiveness of interventions as: clear evidence of benefit; clear evidence of harm; clear evidence of no effect or equivalence; possible benefit; possible harm; or unknown benefit or harm. We defined clear evidence of benefit and clear evidence of harm to be GRADE moderate- or high-quality evidence with a confidence interval (CI) that does not cross the line of no effect. Clear evidence of no effect or equivalence is GRADE moderate- or high-quality evidence with a narrow CI crossing the line of no effect. Possible benefit and possible harm refer to GRADE low-quality evidence with a clear effect (CI does not cross the line of no effect) or GRADE moderate- or high-quality evidence with a wide CI. Unknown harm or benefit refers to GRADE low- or very low-quality evidence with a wide CI. MAIN RESULTS We included 83 SRs; 70 had outcome data. Below we highlight key results from a subset of 36 SRs of interventions intended to prevent PTB. OUTCOME preterm birthClear evidence of benefitFour SRs reported clear evidence of benefit to prevent specific populations of pregnant women from giving birth early, including midwife-led continuity models of care versus other models of care for all women; screening for lower genital tract infections for pregnant women less than 37 weeks' gestation and without signs of labour, bleeding or infection; and zinc supplementation for pregnant women without systemic illness. Cervical cerclage showed clear benefit for women with singleton pregnancy and high risk of PTB only.Clear evidence of harmNo included SR reported clear evidence of harm.No effect or equivalenceFor pregnant women at high risk of PTB, bedrest for women with singleton pregnancy and antibiotic prophylaxis during the second and third trimester were of no effect or equivalent to a comparator.Possible benefitFour SRs found possible benefit in: group antenatal care for all pregnant women; antibiotics for pregnant women with asymptomatic bacteriuria; pharmacological interventions for smoking cessation for pregnant women who smoke; and vitamin D supplements alone for women without pre-existing conditions such as diabetes.Possible harmOne SR reported possible harm (increased risk of PTB) with intramuscular progesterone, but this finding is only relevant to women with multiple pregnancy and high risk of PTB. Another review found possible harm with vitamin D, calcium and other minerals for pregnant women without pre-existing conditions. OUTCOME perinatal deathClear evidence of benefitTwo SRs reported clear evidence of benefit to reduce pregnant women's risk of perinatal death: midwife-led continuity models of care for all pregnant women; and fetal and umbilical Doppler for high-risk pregnant women.Clear evidence of harmNo included SR reported clear evidence of harm.No effect or equivalenceFor pregnant women at high risk of PTB, antibiotic prophylaxis during the second and third trimester was of no effect or equivalent to a comparator.Possible benefitOne SR reported possible benefit with cervical cerclage for women with singleton pregnancy and high risk of PTB.Possible harmOne SR reported possible harm associated with a reduced schedule of antenatal visits for pregnant women at low risk of pregnancy complications; importantly, these women already received antenatal care in settings with limited resources. OUTCOMES preterm birth and perinatal deathUnknown benefit or harmFor pregnant women at high risk of PTB for any reason including multiple pregnancy, home uterine monitoring was of unknown benefit or harm. For pregnant women at high risk due to multiple pregnancy: bedrest, prophylactic oral betamimetics, vaginal progesterone and cervical cerclage were all of unknown benefit or harm. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Implications for practiceThe overview serves as a map and guide to all current evidence relevant to PTB prevention published in the Cochrane Library. Of 70 SRs with outcome data, we identified 36 reviews of interventions with the aim of preventing PTB. Just four of these SRs had evidence of clear benefit to women, with an additional four SRs reporting possible benefit. No SR reported clear harm, which is an important finding for women and health providers alike.The overview summarises no evidence for the clinically important interventions of cervical pessary, cervical length assessment and vaginal progesterone because these Cochrane Reviews were not current. These are active areas for PTB research.The graphic icons we assigned to SR effect estimates do not constitute clinical guidance or an endorsement of specific interventions for pregnant women. It remains critical for pregnant women and their healthcare providers to carefully consider whether specific strategies to prevent PTB will be of benefit for individual women, or for specific populations of women.Implications for researchFormal consensus work is needed to establish standard language for overviews of reviews and to define the limits of their interpretation.Clinicians, researchers and funders must address the lack of evidence for interventions relevant to women at high risk of PTB due to multiple pregnancy.","Medley, Nancy; Vogel, Joshua P; Care, Angharad; Alfirevic, Zarko",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,479,9

Although highly specific, IGRAs have a relatively high false-negative rate in active TB patients. A more sensitive assay is needed. IP-10 is an alternative biomarker with a 100 fold high expression level compared to IFN-γ, allowing for different analysis platforms including molecular detection. The PCR technique is already an integrated tool in most TB laboratories and thus an obvious platform to turn to. In this case-control study, we investigated the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of a molecular assay detecting IP-10 mRNA expression following antigen stimulation of a blood sample. We included 89 TB patients and 99 healthy controls. Blood was drawn in QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT) tubes. Eight hours post-stimulation IP-10 mRNA expression was analyzed and 20 hours post-stimulation IP-10 and IFN-γ protein plasma levels were analyzed using an in-house IP-10 ELISA and the official QFT ELISA, respectively. The IP-10 mRNA assay provided a high specificity (98%) and sensitivity (80%) and AUC=0.97, however, the QFT assay provided a higher overall diagnostic potential with specificity (100%) and sensitivity (90%) and AUC=0.99.

Additionally, some programs have created websites to provide information about their fellowship program. There has been limited research on the amount and breadth of information provided by these different resources. PURPOSE To assess and compare the scope of information provided by the North American Spine Society (NASS) fellowship directory and individual fellowship program websites. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING Web Content Accessibility Study PATIENT SAMPLE: There were no patient data used in this study. All reported data were accessed from public websites and the NASS fellowship directory (August 2022 fellowships). OUTCOME MEASURES Outcome measures were reported as the presence or lack thereof of 22 topics pertaining to the specifics of each individual spine fellowship program on both the NASS fellowship directory and individual fellowship program websites. METHODS The NASS fellowship directory (August 2022 fellowships) and individual program websites were evaluated by two independent reviewers. Program websites were identified via Google search with a systematic protocol. Within each platform, the availability of various data were recorded. Twenty-four different data points were assessed for each program and were categorized into four main categories - general program information, fellow profiles, clinical roles, and non-clinical roles of the fellow. Chi-squared tests were used to compare differences in the availability of specific data provided by the NASS fellowship directory and individual program websites. RESULTS Seventy-four fellowship programs were identified. The NASS fellowship directory was more likely to provide information about the application process, a description of the program, fellow salary, faculty members, case descriptions, and research requirements (p<0.05). The program websites were more likely to provide information about current and previous fellows - including a list of current fellow(s), their education/training, and a list of the previous fellows and their job choice (p<0.05). Program websites were also more likely to discuss rotation schedules, clinic expectations, research opportunities, journal club, institutional meetings, sponsored national meetings, and current/previous research (p<0.05). However, certain information, including specific clinical responsibilities (e.g. rotation schedule, call expectations, clinic expectations) and the profiles of current and previous fellows, were not well represented on either platform. CONCLUSIONS There were significant differences in the type of information provided by the NASS fellowship directory and program websites.

A scoping review protocol.",20.927197,7.777046,2020-06-22,"The prognosis of the liver transplant patients was frequently deteriorated by ischemia and reperfusion injury (IRI) in the liver. Infiltration of inflammatory cells is reported to play critical roles in the pathogenesis of hepatic IRI. Although T lymphocytes, neutrophils and monocytes infiltrated into the liver underwent IRI, we found that neutrophil depletion significantly attenuated the injury and serum liver enzyme levels in a murine model. Interestingly, the expression of CD321/JAM-A/F11R, one of essential molecules for transmigration of circulating leukocytes into inflammatory tissues, was significantly augmented on hepatic sinusoid endothelium at 1 h after ischemia and maintained until 45 min after reperfusion. The intraportal administration of anti-CD321 monoclonal antibody (90G4) significantly inhibited the leukocytes infiltration after reperfusion and diminished the damage responses by hepatic IRI (serum liver enzymes, inflammatory cytokines and hepatocyte cell death). Taken together, presented results demonstrated that blockade of CD321 by 90G4 antibody significantly attenuated hepatic IRI accompanied with substantial inhibition of leukocytes infiltration, particularly inhibition of neutrophil infiltration in the early phase of reperfusion. Thus, our work offers a potent therapeutic target, CD321, for preventing liver IRI.","Yin, Enzhi; Fukuhara, Takeshi; Takeda, Kazuyoshi; Kojima, Yuko; Fukuhara, Kyoko; Ikejima, Kenichi; Bashuda, Hisashi; Kitaura, Jiro; Yagita, Hideo; Okumura, Ko; Uchida, Koichiro",Scientific reports,479,5

There was no significant difference in the lymph node harvest, estimated blood loss, conversion rate, length of stay, or incidence of complications and wound infection between the 2 groups. A robotic procedure was associated with a longer operative time (P < .001) and a higher cost (P = .003). CONCLUSION Robotic assistance in right hemicolectomy is safe and feasible but is associated with a longer operative time and, at present, with a higher cost compared with laparoscopy. However, right hemicolectomy serves as an ideal procedure to begin the learning curve in robotic colorectal surgery, which can subsequently progress to robotic rectal resections where the robot has the greatest potential for benefit.","deSouza, Ashwin L; Prasad, Leela M; Park, John J; Marecik, Slawomir J; Blumetti, Jennifer; Abcarian, Herand",Diseases of the colon and rectum,479,26

The aim of this study was to evaluate the direct impact of mechanical ventilation per se on sleep quantity and quality in patients who were able to tolerate separation from mechanical ventilation over prolonged periods. DESIGN AND SETTING Randomized crossover clinical trial in a medical ICU. PATIENTS Sixteen conscious patients, free of sedation and tracheostomized because of prolonged weaning from mechanical ventilation, were included in the study when able to tolerate at least 5 hours of spontaneous ventilation. INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomized to receive either spontaneous ventilation or mechanical ventilation at low levels of pressure support for two crossover periods of 5-hour duration each, from 22:00 to 08:00. Polysomnography was performed throughout the study. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS Total sleep time was higher during mechanical ventilation than during spontaneous ventilation (183 min vs 132 min, p = 0.04). No significant differences between mechanical ventilation and spontaneous ventilation were observed in slow wave sleep time (45 min vs 28 min), rapid eye movement sleep time (11 min vs 3 min), or the fragmentation index (25 vs 23 arousals and awakenings per hr). In four patients, however, our analysis of patient-ventilator interaction suggested that the ventilatory settings were suboptimal and could have been improved to potentially improve sleep. CONCLUSIONS In difficult-to-wean tracheostomized patients, sleep quality was similar with or without the ventilator. Sleep quantity was higher during mechanical ventilation. Reconnection to the ventilator during the night period may favor sleep efficiency in tracheostomized patients in prolonged weaning.","Roche-Campo, Ferran; Thille, Arnaud W; Drouot, Xavier; Galia, Fabrice; Margarit, Laurent; Córdoba-Izquierdo, Ana; Mancebo, Jordi; d'Ortho, Marie-Pia; Brochard, Laurent",Critical care medicine,479,1

Collaborative research efforts have enabled investigators to respond to the demands of an increasingly complex 21st century landscape, including pressing scientific challenges such as the COVID-19 pandemic. A major contributing factor to the success of team science is the mobilization of core facilities and shared research resources (SRRs), the scientific instrumentation and expertise that exist within research organizations that enable widespread access to advanced technologies for trainees, faculty, and staff. For over 40 years, SRRs have played a key role in accelerating biomedical research discoveries, yet a national strategy that addresses how to leverage these resources to enhance team science and achieve shared scientific goals is noticeably absent.

Magnetic resonance imaging has clarified the natural history of lumbar disc lesions and has documented that disc lesions can become smaller and can even be completely resorbed. Previous studies have confirmed that some traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) therapies can promote resorption of the protrusion. However, high-quality research evidence is needed to support the effectiveness of the protocol. OBJECTIVE This clinical trial aims to establish whether TCM can promote the resorption of LDH and to assess the efficacy of such therapy for LDH, thereby evaluating its clinical effect. METHODS The present study design is for a single-center, 2-arm, open-label randomized controlled trial. A total of 150 eligible LDH patients will be randomly assigned to either a TCM treatment group or a control group in a 1:1 ratio. Patients in the TCM group will be administered a TCM decoction for 4 weeks. Patients in the conventional drug control group will be instructed to take a specific daily dose of celecoxib. The primary outcome measure is the change from baseline in the volume of the protrusion, as assessed using MR images. Secondary outcome measures include visual analog scale pain scores and Japanese Orthopaedic Association scores assessed at 3 and 6 months. DISCUSSION The design and methodological rigor of this trial will allow evaluation of the basic clinical efficacy and safety data for TCM in the treatment of patients with LDH. The trial will also assess whether TCM can promote the resorption of LDH. This research will therefore help provide a solid foundation for the clinical treatment of LDH and for future research in TCM therapy.

METHODS Full-text journal articles were identified through searches of PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, and Cochrane databases and hand searching of journals. RESULTS A total of 4,714 articles were retrieved from searching databases; 1,165 were duplicates. Titles and abstracts of 3,549 were screened, with 171 being selected for full-text review. During full-text review, 101 articles were deemed suitable for inclusion. An additional 24 articles were identified as suitable for inclusion through a hand search of reference lists. Data were extracted from 125 studies. A total of 220 outcome measures were identified. Considered in reference to the World Health Organization International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF), the majority of outcomes were measured at a Body Function level (n = 212, 96%). Outcomes that explored communication and participation in everyday life and attitudes toward communication (ie, activity and participation domains) were infrequent (n = 8; 4%). Quality of life, a construct not measured within the ICF, was also captured by four outcome measures. No instruments evaluating communication partners' perspectives or burden/disability were identified. CONCLUSIONS The outcome measures used in SD treatment studies are many and varied. The outcome measures identified predominately measure constructs within the Body Functions component of the ICF. In order to facilitate data synthesis across trials, the development of a core outcome set is recommended.","Rumbach, Anna; Aiken, Patrick; Novakovic, Daniel",Journal of voice : official journal of the Voice Foundation,479,5

OBJECTIVE to synthesise the existing evidence base on the association between frailty, AF and clinical outcomes. METHODS a systematic review of studies examining the association between validated measures of frailty, AF and clinical outcomes, and meta-analysis of the association between frailty and oral anticoagulation (OAC) prescription. RESULTS twenty studies (30,883 patients) were included, all observational. Fifteen were in hospital, four in the community, one in nursing care. Risk of bias was low-to-moderate. AF prevalence was 3%-38%. In people with AF, frailty was associated with increased stroke incidence, all-cause mortality, symptom severity and length of hospital stay.Meta-analysis of six studies showed frailty was associated with decreased OAC prescription at hospital admission (pooled adjusted OR 0.45 [95%CI 0.22-0.93], three studies), but not at discharge (pooled adjusted OR 0.40 [95%CI 0.13-1.23], three studies). A community-based study showed increased OAC prescription associated with frailty (OR 2.33 [95%CI 1.03-5.23]). CONCLUSION frailty is common, and associated with adverse clinical outcomes in patients with AF. There is evidence of an association between frailty status and OAC prescription, with different direction of effect in community compared with hospital cohorts. Despite the majority of care for older people being provided in the community, there is a lack of evidence on the association between frailty, AF, anticoagulation and clinical outcomes to guide optimal care in this setting.","Wilkinson, Chris; Todd, Oliver; Clegg, Andrew; Gale, Chris P; Hall, Marlous",Age and ageing,479,17

In the setting of a worsening pandemic, there is an urgent need to provide practical guidance to the clinicians on management of the coagulopathy, while waiting for the results from large systematic trials to establish best practices. At our institution, we convened an interdisciplinary group of 25 experts in the field of thrombosis from different medical specialties to review available literature and brainstorm management strategies. The group provided a 3-tiered anticoagulation algorithm for patients with COVID-19 along with a pathway for multidisciplinary review of difficult or refractory cases, which are described in this manuscript.

A 4-year-old multiparous queen with a substernal hernia was admitted for evaluation of a mammary mass. During CT examination, a bifid sternum, the abdominal hernia containing the intestines, spleen, omentum, three fetuses, a mammary mass and an incidental peritoneopericardial diaphragmatic hernia were identified. Surgery consisted of a standard ovariohysterectomy and repair of the peritoneopericardial hernia. Primary closure of the abdominal hernia was attempted but deemed impossible even after the ovariohysterectomy, splenectomy and a partial omentectomy. An external abdominal oblique muscle flap was used to close with no tension on the cranial part of the hernia. One month postoperatively, the queen had no respiratory abnormalities and the herniorrhaphy was fully healed. Relevance and novel information This case is the first description of a 4-year-old multiparous pregnant queen with complex congenital malformations and surgical correction of a peritoneopericardial hernia and a 6 × 8 cmsubsternal hernia with an external abdominal oblique muscle flap. Life-threatening sequelae associated with large abdominal hernias can be attributed to space-occupying effects known as loss of domain and compartment syndrome, which is why a muscle flap was used in this case. The sternal cleft was not repaired because of the size of the cleft and the age of the cat.","Bismuth, Camille; Deroy, Claire",JFMS open reports,479,33

REduce Driveline Trauma through StabIlization and Exit Site ManagemenT (RESIST) was a multicenter, prospective, nonrandomized study designed to evaluate the feasibility of the PLMK for managing the HM2 driveline exit site. Fifty patients were enrolled at five sites at a median of 495 days post-HM2 implant; 92% (46 of 50) of patients used the PLMK for a minimum of 30 days. At 30 days, more patients found the PLMK to be extremely comfortable (80% vs. 37%, p < 0.001) and extremely effective at stabilizing the driveline (82% vs. 40%, p < 0.001) compared with each center's standard of care.

The aim of this study was to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on pet dogs’ behaviour, as reported by their owners, as well as the owners’ experience in relation to their dogs. We hypothesized that dog owners who underwent lockdown or quarantine would indicate more behavioural changes in their dogs and experience support in having a dog during the pandemic. An international online survey asked dog owners questions regarding their household, the dog, and dog-related changes during the pandemic. A total of 688 surveys, collected May-June 2020, were analysed. Respondents were from across Europe (87%), the Americas (9%), and Asia and Australia (together 4%). Data were analysed in GLMM models with a binary distribution and country included as random variable. The main predictor variable was whether the respondent experienced lockdown (300 respondents, 44%), quarantine (76 respondents, 11%) or no restrictions (312 respondents, 45%). Respondents who underwent lockdown or quarantine were 1.8 times more likely to report behavioural changes in their dogs (p = 0.02), with more negative behavioural changes in the dogs reported by respondents in lockdown than expected by chance. However, overall behavioural changes were more often positive (30%) than negative (24%). Respondents in lockdown were 2.6 times more likely to report health changes in their dogs (p = 0.02). The dog was perceived as a source of support during the pandemic: 65% of the respondents indicated reduced tension due to their dog and 47% indicated that the ability to walk the dog outside was another benefit. Advantages were reported more by respondents in lockdown and quarantine as compared to respondents who did not face these restrictions (p &lt; 0.001). Difficulties in dog care were increased for respondents who experienced lockdown or quarantine (p &lt; 0.01) and those who had no garden as compared to those who did (p &lt; 0.001). One-third of the respondents took dog-related measures to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, and this was associated with more behavioural changes and more difficulties. In conclusion, lockdown, and to a lesser extent quarantine, may influence the dogs’ behaviour and health, or the owners’ awareness of it, and can contribute to a perceived tension-reduction in the owners.","Jezierski, Tadeusz Camerlink Irene Peden Rachel S.

Design Qualitative cross-sectional survey. Setting New Zealand community cohort. Participants 1040 respondents entered the study (18-90 years, M = 48.18.11, SD = 15.52, 76% women). 966 completed the questions relevant to this article. Participants were recruited via online advertisement campaigns designed to maximise variation in the sample as far as practicably possible. Main outcome measures Thematic analysis of participants' narratives. Results A majority of participants reported that the elimination of SARS-CoV-2 had allowed their life to go back to being ""more or less the same"" as before the pandemic. A small number indicated the pandemic had inspired them to become more social following elimination. Nevertheless, a sizeable minority of respondents reported being less social, even many months after SARS-CoV-2 had been eliminated. This was often because of fears that the virus might be circulating undetected, or because the March-May 2020 lockdown had led to changes in relationships and personal habits that were not easily reversed. Becoming less social was associated with having an underlying health condition that heightened one's vulnerability to COVID-19 (p = 0.00005) and older age (p = 0.007). Conclusions Elimination strategies can successfully allow the public to return to a pre-pandemic ""normal"" - or reinvent and improve their social lives should they wish. However, such outcomes are not inevitable. Re-establishing social connections after elimination can sometimes be a challenging process, with which people may need support. Plans for providing such support should be an integral part of elimination strategies.","Long, N. J.; Appleton, N. S.; Davies, S.

In this mini-review, we have discussed why the Faculty of Medicine, University of Gezira (FMUG), Sudan, can lead in social accountability in Africa and the Middle East. This critical analysis is based on searching the literature published in PubMed, Medline, Scopus and Google scholar. We added sections about reflection on opportunities and future direction for FMUG on social accountability. Many unique features in the curriculum that led to excellence in teaching, research and service, will qualify FMUG to lead in social accountability. The location in the heart of Sudan and being community-oriented medical education meant that FMUG, over the last 45 years, gained and mastered the art of social accountability. FMUG continues to be a leader in medical education and has a pioneer master's program in medical education. The majority of the graduates who are not staff members continued to support the medical school many years after their graduation (teaching, research and donation) and promote the concept of social accountability at the national and international level. The curriculum meets all of the competencies of social medicine. Hence, graduates are influential leaders in all medical specialties, and most importantly, in addressing the priority health concerns of the community in rural and urban areas. Therefore, through research and innovations, FMUG can establish social accountability alliance for medical schools and consider adding more unique components to the concept of social accountability (promotion of concept health made at home, especially during COVID-19 pandemic). For instance, retention and recruitment of doctors (training and promotion) and brain drain are main challenges to many health authorities in African and Middle East countries. Another area of innovation, is environmental social accountability of medical schools in order to develop environmentally sustainable solutions to address health concerns especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. This of considerable importance as Gezira state has one of the largest irrigation agriculture schemes in the world. We believe that medical schools' concept of social accountability will continue to evolve, likely depending on the community's needs. © Journal of Public Health and Emergency.

Virus and host cell dynamics are strictly connected, and convey in virion assembly to ensure virus spread in the body. Study of the systemic behavior of virus-host interaction at the single-cell level is a scientific challenge, considering the difficulties of using experimental approaches and the limited knowledge of the behavior of emerging novel virus as a collectivity. This work focuses on positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses, like human coronaviruses, in their virus-individual host interaction, studying the changes induced in the host cell bioenergetics. A systems-thinking representation, based on stock-flow diagramming of virus-host interaction at the cellular level, is used here for the first time to simulate the system energy dynamics. We found that reducing the energy flow which fuels virion assembly is the most affordable strategy to limit the virus spread, but its efficacy is mitigated by the contemporary inhibition of other flows relevant for the system. Summary Positive-single-strand ribonucleic acid ((+)ssRNA) viruses can cause multiple outbreaks, for which comprehensive tailored therapeutic strategies are still missing. Virus and host cell dynamics are strictly connected, generating a complex dynamics that conveys in virion assembly to ensure virus spread in the body. This work focuses on (+)ssRNA viruses in their virus-individual host interaction, studying the changes induced in the host cell bioenergetics. A systems-thinking representation, based on stock-flow diagramming of virus-host interaction at the cellular level, is used here for the first time to simulate the energy dynamics of the system. By means of a computational simulator based on the systemic diagramming, we identifid host protein recycling and folded-protein synthesis as possible new leverage points. These also address different strategies depending on time setting of the therapeutic procedures. Reducing the energy flow which fuels virion assembly is addressed as the most affordable strategy to limit the virus spread, but its efficacy is mitigated by the contemporary inhibition of other flows relevant for the system. Counterintuitively, targeting RNA replication or virion budding does not give rise to relevant systemic effects, and can possibly contribute to further virus spread. The tested combinations of multiple systemic targets are less efficient in minimizing the stock of virions than targeting only the virion assembly process, due to the systemic configuration and its evolution overtime. Viral load and early addressing (in the first two days from infection) of leverage points are the most effective strategies on stock dynamics to minimize virion assembly and preserve host-cell bioenergetics. As a whole, our work points out the need for a systemic approach to design effective therapeutic strategies that should take in account the dynamic evolution of the system.","Romano, Alessandra; Casazza, Marco; Gonella, Francesco",bioRxiv,479,27

Patients with systemic rheumatic diseases may be at increased risk for respiratory failure with COVID-19. Therefore, we investigated the relationship between rheumatic disease, hyperinflammation, and clinical outcomes among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Objectives: To compare laboratory values, hyperinflammation, and clinical outcomes of hospitalized COVID-19 rheumatic patients and matched comparators. Methods: We performed a comparative cohort study of patients with polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed COVID-19 requiring hospitalization between 3/1/20-7/7/20 at a large health care system. We compared each systemic rheumatic disease case to up to 5 matched (by age, sex, and date of +SARS-CoV-2 PCR) comparators without systemic rheumatic disease. We extracted laboratory values from their hospitalization to compare peaks/troughs of individual laboratory results by case status and derived the COVID-19-associated hyperinflammation score (cHIS), a composite of 6 laboratory domains (0-6, ≥2 indicating hyperinflammation), as previously developed1. We used multivariable logistic regression to estimate ORs for COVID-19 outcomes by hyperinflammation and case status. Results: We identified 57 hospitalized rheumatic disease cases (mean age 67 years, 67% female) and 232 matched comparators hospitalized with PCR-confirmed COVID-19. Among cases, 26 (46%) had rheumatoid arthritis and 14 (25%) had systemic lupus erythematosus. Most cases (34, 60%) had active rheumatic disease. At baseline, 15 (27%) of cases were treated with biologic DMARDs, and 32 (56%) were using glucocorticoids. We analyzed 39,900 total laboratory results (median 85 per patient). Cases had higher peak neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (9.6 vs 7.8, p=0.02), LDH (421 vs 345 U/L, p=0.04), creatinine (1.2 vs 1.0 mg/dL, p=0.01), and BUN (31 vs 23 mg/dL, p=0.03) than comparators but similar peak CRP (149 vs 116 mg/L, p=0.11, Figure 1). Cases had higher peak median cHIS (3 vs 2, p=0.01). Peak cHIS ≥2 had higher odds of intensive care unit (ICU) admission (OR 3.45, 95%CI 1.98-5.99), mechanical ventilation (OR 66.0, 95%CI 9.0-487.8), and mortality (OR 16.4, 95%CI 4.8-56.4) compared to cHIS <2 (Table 1). Cases had increased risk of ICU admission (OR 2.0, 95%CI 1.1-3.7) and mechanical ventilation (OR 2.7, 95%CI 1.4-5.2) than comparators Conclusion: Patients with systemic rheumatic disease hospitalized for COVID-19 had higher risk for hyperinflammation, kidney injury, and mechanical ventilation than non-rheumatic comparators. We validated the cHIS in our cohort, which was strongly associated with poor COVID-19 outcomes. These findings highlight that hospitalized patients with rheumatic diseases may be vulnerable to poor COVID-19 outcomes.","Hsu, T.; D'Silva, K.; Serling-Boyd, N.; Wang, J.; Mueller, A.; Fu, X.; Prisco, L.; Martin, L.; Vanni, K.; Zaccardelli, A.; Cook, C.; Choi, H.; Zhang, Y.; Gravallese, E.; Wallace, Z.; Sparks, J.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,479,24

The rise of telepractice, telesupervision, and distance learning, adapted as solutions to the obstacles caused by the pandemic, are explained in detail, while the benefits and limitations are discussed at each step. The professional development that had to take place before this rise is also described. Conclusions: The utilization of online/telecommunication technology for education, practical training, and speech-language pathologist service delivery during the time of COVID-19 in Cyprus is here to stay and will probably affect the future of the profession's clinical practice, and consequently, training programs in Cyprus in the years to come. It is uncertain if the effects of such adaptations can generalize in other populations or countries, especially where regulations and policies are already in place, or where the technological foundation is not similar.

During the first phase of the 2020 lockdown (from the beginning of March 2020 - to the beginning of May 2020), a real-time dataset was built, linking data scratching to three events related to the introduction of the Prime Minister's decrees and his press conferences. The chosen observation point is Twitter, platform that allows us to monitor the emergence of discussions on public issues, extremely synchronized with events and news - which is, moreover, a feature of use of this platform. The coronavirus hashtag was chosen as a mechanism to track the development of Italian reactions, following the evolution of its sense and sensemaking and considering it as a polysemic collector. The aim is to identify within the tweets the actors, the topics, and the tone of the debate in an open public space. Furthermore, the analysis is carried out in search of the Italians' perception of the lockdown and whether they are in favor of it because of the defense of public health or they see it as a restriction of their individual freedom. The analysis, which used the socio-constructivist approach of Emotional Text Mining, reveals two explanatory-dimensions in the governance of the crisis: lockdown and breakdown and allows us to understand the reasons for Twitter's instinct-reactions.","Artieri, G.

On March 11, 2020, World Health Organization (WHO) declared NCOVID-19 as a pandemic. The Government of India (GOI) took several actions to control the spread of the pandemic in the country and issued several guidelines for public and organizations. The adversity caused by pandemic required continuity of electric supply to consumers. The latter was achieved through proper planning and execution. The Indian Power System Operator, POSOCO through its National and Regional Load Dispatch Centers (NLDC and RLDCs) assessed the situation early and took all planned efforts for the Indian power system operation which is essential for keeping 'lights ON' during these hours of crisis. Strategic team at the top management level and tactical teams at the individual control center level were formed to handle any unforeseen circumstances. This paper has discussed the various actions taken by POSOCO during NCOVID-19 scenario and impact of it on Indian power system. Impact of exceptional events as faced during pandemic period, like, Janata Curfew, Lights-Off event, Super Cyclonic Storms 'Amphan', 'Nisarga', and Solar eclipse is also discussed in the paper.

Scholars exerted the mixed findings are largely influenced by several factors and contexts where different markets, type of companies, industries, and countries would show different results. On that basis, this study examines how the dimensions of objective environment influence the relationship between CSR dimensions and the business performance of Takaful agencies in Malaysia. Malaysia was chosen as the country because it is among the largest Takaful contributors in the world. Stakeholder and contingency theory are used to analyze the hypothetical relationship between the variables. Questionnaires were distributed to Takaful agency managers who operate their businesses in Kuala Lumpur, Putrajaya, and Selangor state. About 211 of them participated in this study. The empirical findings suggest that economic and ethical activities have a direct influence on Takaful agencies’ business performance. Further results imply that while environmental dynamism influences business performance directly, environmental complexity significantly moderates the relationship between legal, philanthropy, and business performance. This research considered only the direct effect of CSR activities and the moderating effect of environmental dimensions on business performance with only the agency managers’ perspective studied. It adds new insights to the CSR and Takaful literature by revealing the relationship between the dimensions of CSR and business performance in the Takaful context, and sheds light on how governing authorities and Takaful operators should implement the CSR strategy and activities to make the industry successful in Malaysia and around the world, as Takaful businesses are heading towards becoming a global industry.","Muhamad Azrin, Nazri Omar Nor Asiah Aman Aini Ayob Abu Hanifah Ramli Nur Ainna",Sustainability,479,16

Experiential learning-through simulation or direct patient contact-is essential for the development of clinical skills and procedural knowledge. Adapting this type of teaching for remote delivery is a major challenge for undergraduate medical education. It is also an opportunity for innovation in technology enhanced learning and prompts educators to embrace new ways of thinking. In this article, the authors explored how educators from different disciplines (medicine, music and performing arts) are using technology to enhance practical skills-based learning remotely. The authors, five experienced educators from different fields (surgery, medicine, music and magic), jointly documented the transition to technology enhanced remote teaching through a series of five structured conversations. Drawing from literature on distance learning in medicine and professional experience in education, the authors identified seven practice-enhancing recommendations for optimising teaching of procedural knowledge and skills. These are: (1) make a virtue out of necessity;(2) actively manage your environment;(3) make expectations clear;(4) embrace purposeful communication;(5) use digital resources;(6) be prepared for things to go wrong and (7) personalise the approach. The authors argue that widening the discourse in technology enhanced learning to include cross-disciplinary perspectives adds richness and depth to discussions.

With the reorganization of the entire Healthcare system to deal with COVID-19, Regional Health Authorities recognized mental health as a priority and authorized the continuation of mental health services for the general population. Objectives: To review the initiatives and procedures implemented in Lombardy during the Covid-19 pandemic in relation to the organization of Psychiatric Services and continuity of psychopharmacological treatment. Results: Hospital admissions for acute psychiatric disorders in patients positive for COVID-19 required a dedicated area in the psychiatric ward or alternatively, a medical ward supported by psychiatric staff. Psychiatric hospital activity for patients negative for Covid-19 has been maintained as usual. The activity in the Mental Health Centers has been maintained in patients suffering from severe mental disorders as well as in those with serious social problems or judicial sentences. Particular attention was paid to patients’ clinical monitoring and drug administration. Long-acting Injection antipsychotics were often preferred to oral treatment to ensure adherence and continuity of care. Appropriate e-health technologies were used to reach patients and their families, for monitoring patients and avoiding drop-outs of patients with serious diseases. Conclusions: Maintaining continuous monitoring of patients in contact with mental health services is essential for a careful assessment of their condition from both a psychopathological and medical point of view during pandemic.DisclosureNo significant relationships.","Vita, A.",European Psychiatry,479,16

As a result, most children receive antibiotics that do not need. This study aims to build and validate a diagnostic tool combining clinical, analytical and radiographical features to sequentially differentiate viral from bacterial CAP, and among bacterial CAP, typical from atypical bacteria, to improve choice of treatment. Methods Consecutive hospitalized children between 1 month and 16 years of age with CAP were enrolled. An extensive microbiological workup was performed. A score was built with a training set of 70% patients, to first differentiate between viral and bacterial CAP and secondly, typical from atypical bacterial CAP. To select variables, a Ridge model was used. Optimal cut-off points were selected to maximize specificity setting a high sensitivity (80%). Weights of each variable were calculated with a multivariable logistic regression. The score was validated with the rest of the participants. Results In total, 262 (53%) children (median age, 2 years, 52.3% male) had an etiological diagnosis. The step 1 discriminates viral from bacterial CAP. Bacterial CAPs were classified with a sensitivity=97%, a specificity=48%, and a ROC area under the curve (AUC)=0.81. If a CAP was classificated as bacterial, it was assessed with step 2. The step 2 differentiates typical vs. atypical bacterial CAP. Typical bacteria were classified with a sensitivity=100%, a specificity=64%, and AUC=0.90.

The aim of our work was to assess the impact of this 2-month confinement on the clinical and biological profile of diabetic patients hospitalized in diabetology. Patients and Methods: This is a cross-sectional, observational, descriptive study that involved 110 diabetic patients hospitalized in department A of the National Institute of Nutrition and Food Technology of Tunis (Tunisia) from June 1 until June 30, 2020. Results : The mean age of the patients was 49.72±11.99years with ranges ranging from 16 to 77 years old;63.6% of patients were female and 73.6% of patients were type 2. The average duration of diabetes was 11.53±8.62years, with extremes ranging from 0to24 years. The mean level of glycated hemoglobin was 12.03±3.97% and the Body-Mass-Index was 29.44kg/m² with extremes ranging from 16.26to40.19kg/m². Weight gain was reported in 73% of patients with an average of 4.77±1.98kg within 2 months of confinement, with extremes ranging from 2to11kg. Two patients (1.8%) were hospitalized for inaugural diabetic ketosis. The others were admitted for an imbalance(81.8%) or an acute decompensation of their diabetes(16.4%). The factors of imbalance or decompensation were: a poor compliance with hygienic-dietetic measures(90.9%);a medication poor compliance(41.8%), more than half of which(54.3%) was due to the inability of the patient to go to the local health center to obtain his medication;lipodystrophies(42.7% of patients on insulin);a stomatological infection(8.2%);an urinary tract infection(4.5%) and an acute coronary syndrome(0.9%). Conclusions : The diabetic patient is at high risk of a severe form of Covid-19. However, the confinement imposed by the pandemic seems to be one of the factors of diabetes imbalance (in particular by weight gain and poor adherence to therapy). It is therefore essential to strengthen the education and treatment of diabetic patients.","Mahjoub, Faten Amor Nadia Ben Berriche Olfa Jamoussi Henda",Diabetes,479,33

Deletion analysis showed that efficient internal initiation required a segment of the HCV genome extending from about nucleotides 40-370 and that deletions from the 3'-end of this element were highly deleterious. As the authentic initiation codon for HCV polyprotein synthesis is at nucleotide 342, this demonstrates that, besides 5'-UTR sequences, a short length of HCV coding sequences is required for internal initiation. This finding was confirmed in transfection assays of BT7-H cells and was shown to be independent of the nature of the downstream reporter cistron. The strong requirement for coding sequences is in sharp contrast to internal initiation of picornavirus RNA translation. As a probable correlate with this, it was also found that the efficiency of internal initiation was only marginally compromised when the authentic initiation codon was mutated to a non-AUG codon, again in sharp contrast with the picornaviruses. The finding that coding sequences are required for internal initiation has important implications for the design of experiments to test for internal initiation of translation of cellular mRNAs.","Reynolds, J E; Kaminski, A; Kettinen, H J; Grace, K; Clarke, B E; Carroll, A R; Rowlands, D J; Jackson, R J",,479,33

Trends and concepts of clinical diagnosis and handling will be evaluated and their implications for muscle physiology and nutritional/metabolic intervention discussed. RECENT FINDINGS Conventional electrophysiology was combined with direct muscle stimulation to better differentiate critical illness myopathy from other neuromuscular disorders in critical illness. Muscle weakness was the result of impaired excitation-contraction-coupling at the level of the sarcolemma and the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane. Critical illness may alter sodium and ryanodine receptor calcium-release channels. Also, increased muscle proteolysis contributes to weakness in critical illness myopathy. Myosin loss is due to the risk factors systemic inflammatory response syndrome/sepsis, steroids and neuromuscular blocking agents. Steroids can also induce necrosis and apoptosis in muscle. Inflammatory mediators aggravated muscle metabolic failure in critical illness myopathy. Ubiquitin-proteasome pathways, cyclooxygenase activation, altered glucose transporter expression, MyoD suppression, impaired respiratory chain enzymes, ATP depletion, glucose toxicity and insulin resistance can all contribute to the critical illness myopathy pathomechanism. SUMMARY The search for pathomechanisms is an important task for both clinical and basic sciences. Targets for treatment or prevention of critical illness myopathy include systemic inflammatory response, increased proteolysis and reduced antioxidative capacitance in critically ill patients.","Friedrich, Oliver",Current opinion in clinical nutrition and metabolic care,479,12

An IBV D-RNA, CD-61, derived from a naturally occurring IBV Beaudette D-RNA, CD-91, is being developed as a D-RNA vector for IBV. In order to use CD-61 as a vector it will require rescue by heterologous strains in addition to Beaudette. Rescue will be determined by recognition of replication and packaging signals within the D-RNA by the helper virus. The 5' and 3' UTRs are believed to contain sequences involved in replication and transcription. The 5' and 3' UTRs of six strains of IBV have been sequenced and experiments performed using six strains of helper virus for rescue of CD-61 to determine whether rescue correlates with sequence conservation within the 5' and 3' UTRs. Results indicate that all strains of helper virus rescued the D-RNA to varying degrees. Sequence comparisons show a high degree of sequence identity in the UTRs, but enough strain differences exist to be used as markers.

For characterization of the pre-S2 glycosylation, pre-S2 (glyco)peptides were released from native, patient-derived hepatitis B virus subviral particles by tryptic digestion, separated from remaining particles, purified by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography, and identified by amino acid and N-terminal sequence analysis as well as matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS).

In addition, the pre-S2 domain of M protein, but not that of L protein, was found to be partially O-glycosylated by a Gal(beta1-3)GalNAcalpha-, Neu5Ac(alpha2-3)Gal(beta1-3)GalNAcalpha-, or GalNAcalpha-residue. The respective O-glycosylation site was assigned to Thr-37 by digestion with carboxypeptidases in combination with MALDI-TOF-MS and by quadrupole time-of-flight electrospray mass spectrometry. Analytical data further revealed that about 90% of M protein is N-terminally acetylated.","Schmitt, S; Glebe, D; Alving, K; Tolle, T K; Linder, M; Geyer, H; Linder, D; Peter-Katalinic, J; Gerlich, W H; Geyer, R",The Journal of biological chemistry,479,20

Based, in both cases, on mathematical models employing the incidence/window-period method, the relative risk of transmission from pooled versus apheresis platelets (2.2 or 2.75 for HIV, 2.7 or 3.375 for HCV, and 3.2 or 4.0 for HBV, with pools of 4 or 5 concentrates, respectively) is similar to the difference in risk before (versus after) introduction of HIV-1 and HCV RNA screening. The absolute increase in the risk from pools (1 to 2 HIV-, HCV-, or HBV-infectious platelet doses annually) is much smaller than the yield from HIV-1 and HCV RNA screening projected in the 1990s, but it becomes similar to that yield (with up to 88 infectious platelet doses intercepted) when we consider the next transfusion-transmitted pathogen to emerge in the future. Although pathogen reduction (PR) of platelets would eliminate the difference in risk between pooled and apheresis platelets vis-a-vis viral transmission, PR is not ready for implementation because the safety of PR needs to be investigated further. German transfusion guidelines should be revised to indicate the difference in risk associated with pooled versus apheresis platelets, and transition toward an all-apheresis platelet supply should commence. These actions are consistent with and proportionate to the action taken in the 1990s when screening for HIV-1 and HCV RNA was implemented.","Vamvakas, E C; Hitzler, W E",Clinical laboratory,479,26

Infection of mammalian cells with poliovirus and other picornaviruses results in the accumulation of dramatically rearranged and vesiculated membranes. Poliovirus-induced membranes did not cofractionate with endoplasmic reticulum (ER), lysosomes, mitochondria, or the majority of Golgi-derived or endosomal membranes in buoyant density gradients, although changes in ionic strength affected ER and virus-induced vesicles, but not other cellular organelles, similarly. When expressed in isolation, two viral proteins of the poliovirus RNA replication complex, 3A and 2C, cofractionated with ER membranes. However, in cells that expressed 2BC, a proteolytic precursor of the 2B and 2C proteins, membranes identical in buoyant density to those observed during poliovirus infection were formed. When coexpressed with 2BC, viral protein 3A was quantitatively incorporated into these fractions, and the membranes formed were ultrastructurally similar to those in poliovirus-infected cells. These data argue that poliovirus-induced vesicles derive from the ER by the action of viral proteins 2BC and 3A by a mechanism that excludes resident host proteins. The double-membraned morphology, cytosolic content, and apparent ER origin of poliovirus-induced membranes are all consistent with an autophagic origin for these membranes.","Suhy, D A; Giddings, T H; Kirkegaard, K",Journal of virology,479,33

IGD is an area of concern in the Diagnostic and Statistics Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), which can be objectively assessed by dysfunctional behaviour and the increasing time of being online, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Electroencephalography (EEG) identifies amplitude changes in the evoked response potential (ERP) among IGDs, correlated with underlying comorbidities. MATERIALS AND METHODS A scoping review was performed to elaborate on the research regarding resting-state EEG and task-based EEG, particularly for Go/No-go paradigms pertaining to subjects with IAD or specifically IGD. The role of EEG was identified in its diagnostic capability to identify the salient changes that occurred in the response to reward network and the executive control network, using restingstate and task-based EEG. The implication of using EEG in monitoring the therapy for IAD and IGD was also reviewed. RESULTS EEG generally revealed reduced beta waves and increased theta waves in addicts. IGD with depression demonstrated increased theta and decreased alpha waves. Whereas increased P300, a late cognitive ERP component, was frequently associated with impaired excessive allocation of attentional resources of the IAD towards addiction-specific cues. IGD had increased whole brain delta waves at baseline, which showed significant reduction post therapy. CONCLUSION EEG can identify distinct neurophysiological changes among Internet Addiction Disorder and Internet Gaming Disorder that are akin to substance abuse disorders.","Sharifat, H; Suppiah, S",The Medical journal of Malaysia,479,20

The mean follow-up duration was 25.4 months. The fused segment angle was measured on serial radiographs. Whole cervical spine alignment changed from 12.8° to 9.9°. The alignment of the fused segment worsened by mean 3.3°. To elucidate the characteristics of worsening of the fused segment, the 30 patients were divided into 2 groups: Group I (n = 20) without and Group II (n = 10) with postoperative worsening of the fused segment. The loss in the fused segment angle was significantly greater in Group II (8.0°) than Group I (0.9°). Preoperative range of motion and disc height were significantly greater in Group II than Group I. Worsening of the fused segment angle occurred within 1 month in Group I, whereas stabilization was observed after 3 months in Group II. Graft subsidence was primarily posterior and inferior. Our results indicate that the preoperative range of motion and disc height of the fused segment must be considered to prevent worsening in that segment after anterior fusion.

Novel risk factors, often new to science, were identified, the role and significance of already known factors better comprehended, and occupational groups endangered by biological hazards more thoroughly recognized. Novel viruses and prions, emerging in different parts of the world, may pose a particular threat to health and life of health care workers, agriculture workers and veterinarians. A new coronavirus (SCoV) that evoked a rapid outbreak of disease described as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in the first half of 2003 may serve as an example. The disease was particularly common among health care workers. Previously discovered zoonotic viruses, Nipah virus in pigs and Hendra virus in horses, may be a cause of fatal encephalitis in animal farmers. Hantaviruses (Puumala, Hantaan, Sin Nombre and others) infecting field rodents may be a cause of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) or pulmonary syndrome (HPS) in farmers and laboratory workers. Prions responsible for inducing a zoonotic variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) are considered to be a potential cause of work-related infections in agricultural and health care workers, however, this assumption has not as yet been supported by any conclusive evidence. In many countries, blood-borne occupational infections with hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the major epidemiological problem among health care workers, mostly because no vaccine against this virus has been produced to date. Vaccinations effectively restricted the number of occupational infections with hepatitis B virus (HBV), and work-related infections with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) causing acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) are very rare. Hazardous bioserosols, occurring in many work environments, pose an occupational health hazard of particular importance. Many new biological factors present in organic dusts that may induce work-related allergic and immunotoxic diseases among farmers and workers of the agricultural and wood industries have been identified. Droplet aerosols, which are generated from water, oils, oil-water emulsions and other liquids in various work environments, may contain infectious agents (Legionella spp.) as well as allergic and/or toxic agents. It has been shown that allergens and endotoxins produced by Gram-negative bacteria occurring in oil mist from metalworking fluids may cause occupational respiratory diseases in workers of the metallurgic industry.","Dutkiewicz, Jacek",Medycyna pracy,479,7

However, whether these new infections cease to occur in the future in Japan, similar to abroad, is unclear. To evaluate the feasibility of this achievement, we conducted a time series analysis using Bayesian local linear trend model to evaluate the possibility of zero new infection of HIV/AIDS in Japan. METHODS We used quarterly data on HIV/AIDS from the first quarter, 2001 to the second quarter, 2020. Bayesian analyses were conducted using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, and a local linear trend model was constructed for number of newly diagnosed HIV infection without AIDS diagnosis, AIDS cases, and their aggregate. Predictions for the following 60 quarters until the second quarter of 2035 were also made for all models. RESULTS The mean aggregate cases of HIV/AIDS patients became 0 by the fourth quarter of 2031 (90% credible interval 0-535). For HIV infections alone, mean cases became 0 by the second quarter of 2030 (90%CrI 0-472). For AIDS alone mean cases were 9 at the second quarter of 2035 (90%CrI 0-231). CONCLUSION Our local linear trend model suggested that number of HIV/AIDS cases in Japan could decrease to zero by the first quarter of 2031, if the trend of the infections followed the local linear trend model, yet with rather wide credible interval. Achieving zero new transmission of HIV in Japan is a realistic goal but measures to make it faster may be needed.","Iwata, Kentaro; Miyakoshi, Chisato",The Kobe journal of medical sciences,479,16

ANIMALS 50 specific pathogen-free (SPF) embryonated chicken eggs, 30 White Leghorn SPF chickens, and 12 clinically normal pigeons. PROCEDURES Pancreatic tissue specimens from sick pigeons were inoculated into SPF embryonated chicken eggs for viral isolation and investigation of morphologic and hemagglutinating properties of the isolate, called PSH050513. Furthermore, virulence studies in SPF chickens and experimental pigeons were performed. The spike (S) glycoprotein gene of PSH050513 was further sequenced and analyzed. RESULTS PSH050513 was isolated and identified from the experimentally infected pigeons by a routine method, which was in accordance with Koch's postulates. The complete S protein (1,167 amino acids) was compared with published S protein sequences of other avian and mammalian coronaviruses. A high degree of sequence identity (79.3% to 99.6%) was observed between the S protein sequence of PSH050513 and published sequences of avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV); only limited identity (< 37.8%) was observed with turkey coronavirus and mammalian coronaviruses. Furthermore, when the virus was inoculated into SPF chickens, pancreatitis developed. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE PSH050513 has been tentatively identified as a novel member of group 3 coronaviruses that have close genetic relationships with IBV strains.","Qian, Dong H; Zhu, Guo J; Wu, Li Z; Hua, Guo X",American journal of veterinary research,479,1

We aimed to estimate the impact of hypothetical disruptions to organised faecal immunochemical test-based colorectal cancer screening programmes on short-term and long-term colorectal cancer incidence and mortality in three countries using microsimulation modelling. METHODS: In this modelling study, we used four country-specific colorectal cancer microsimulation models-Policy1-Bowel (Australia), OncoSim (Canada), and ASCCA and MISCAN-Colon (the Netherlands)-to estimate the potential impact of COVID-19-related disruptions to screening on colorectal cancer incidence and mortality in Australia, Canada, and the Netherlands annually for the period 2020-24 and cumulatively for the period 2020-50. Modelled scenarios varied by duration of disruption (3, 6, and 12 months), decreases in screening participation after the period of disruption (0%, 25%, or 50% reduction), and catch-up screening strategies (within 6 months after the disruption period or all screening delayed by 6 months). FINDINGS: Without catch-up screening, our analysis predicted that colorectal cancer deaths among individuals aged 50 years and older, a 3-month disruption would result in 414-902 additional new colorectal cancer diagnoses (relative increase 0·1-0·2%) and 324-440 additional deaths (relative increase 0·2-0·3%) in the Netherlands, 1672 additional diagnoses (relative increase 0·3%) and 979 additional deaths (relative increase 0·5%) in Australia, and 1671 additional diagnoses (relative increase 0·2%) and 799 additional deaths (relative increase 0·3%) in Canada between 2020 and 2050, compared with undisrupted screening. A 6-month disruption would result in 803-1803 additional diagnoses (relative increase 0·2-0·4%) and 678-881 additional deaths (relative increase 0·4-0·6%) in the Netherlands, 3552 additional diagnoses (relative increase 0·6%) and 1961 additional deaths (relative increase 1·0%) in Australia, and 2844 additional diagnoses (relative increase 0·3%) and 1319 additional deaths (relative increase 0·4%) in Canada between 2020 and 2050, compared with undisrupted screening. A 12-month disruption would result in 1619-3615 additional diagnoses (relative increase 0·4-0·9%) and 1360-1762 additional deaths (relative increase 0·8-1·2%) in the Netherlands, 7140 additional diagnoses (relative increase 1·2%) and 3968 additional deaths (relative increase 2·0%) in Australia, and 5212 additional diagnoses (relative increase 0·6%) and 2366 additional deaths (relative increase 0·8%) in Canada between 2020 and 2050, compared with undisrupted screening. Providing immediate catch-up screening could minimise the impact of the disruption, restricting the relative increase in colorectal cancer incidence and deaths between 2020 and 2050 to less than 0·1% in all countries. A post-disruption decrease in participation could increase colorectal cancer incidence by 0·2-0·9% and deaths by 0·6-1·6% between 2020 and 2050, compared with undisrupted screening. INTERPRETATION: Although the projected effect of short-term disruption to colorectal cancer screening is modest, such disruption will have a marked impact on colorectal cancer incidence and deaths between 2020 and 2050 attributable to missed screening. Thus, it is crucial that, if disrupted, screening programmes ensure participation rates return to previously observed rates and provide catch-up screening wherever possible, since this could mitigate the impact on colorectal cancer deaths.

METHODS: We used an age-structured, expanded SEIR model with social contact matrices to assess age-specific vaccine allocation strategies in India. We used state-specific age structures and disease transmission coefficients estimated from confirmed incident cases of COVID-19 between 1 July and 31 August 2020. Simulations were used to investigate the relative reduction in mortality and morbidity of vaccine allocation strategies based on prioritizing different age groups, and the interactions of these strategies with concurrent non-pharmaceutical interventions. Given the uncertainty associated with COVID-19 vaccine development, we varied vaccine characteristics in the modelling simulations. RESULTS: Prioritizing COVID-19 vaccine allocation for older populations (i.e., >60 years) led to the greatest relative reduction in deaths, regardless of vaccine efficacy, control measures, rollout speed, or immunity dynamics. Preferential vaccination of this group often produced relatively higher total symptomatic infections and more pronounced estimates of peak incidence than other assessed strategies. Vaccine efficacy, immunity type, target coverage, and rollout speed significantly influenced overall strategy effectiveness, with the time taken to reach target coverage significantly affecting the relative mortality benefit comparative to no vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support global recommendations to prioritize COVID-19 vaccine allocation for older age groups. Relative differences between allocation strategies were reduced as the speed of vaccine rollout was increased.

METHODS: A comparison was made among the number of first cellular pathological diagnoses of malignancy made from the 11th to the 20th week of the years 2018-2020. RESULTS: Cancer diagnoses fell in 2020 by 39% compared with the average number recorded in 2018 and 2019. Prostate cancer (75%) bladder cancer (66%) and colorectal cancer (CRC; 62%) had the greatest decrease. CRC was identified as carrying a potentially important diagnostic delay. CONCLUSIONS: For CRC corrective procedures (continuing mass screening tests; patient triage by family physicians; diagnostic procedures alternative to colonoscopy; predictive evaluation on biopsy samples) were advised. Our simple audit model is widely applicable to avoid pandemic-related delay in clinical diagnosis of cancer.,"De Vincentiis, Ludovica; Carr, Richard A; Mariani, Maria Paola; Ferrara, Gerardo",J. clin. pathol,479,24

The aim of this study was to identify which blood tests could be used to assist in diagnosing COVID-19. METHOD: A retrospective review was performed on consecutive patients referred to hospital with a clinical suspicion of COVID-19 over a period of four weeks. The patient's clinical presentation and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR) were recorded. The patients were divided by diagnosis into COVID (COVID-19 infection) or CONTROL (an alternate diagnosis). A retrospective review of consecutive patients over a further two-week period was used for the purposes of validation. RESULTS: Overall, 399 patients (53% COVID, 47% CONTROL) were analysed. White cell count, neutrophils and lymphocytes were significantly lower, while lactate dehydrogenase and ferritin were significantly higher, in the COVID group in comparison to CONTROL. Combining the white cell count, lymphocytes and ferritin results into a COVID Combined Blood Test (CCBT) had an area under the curve of 0.79. Using a threshold CCBT of -0.8 resulted in a sensitivity of 0.85 and a specificity of 0.63. Analysing this against a further retrospective review of 181 suspected COVID-19 patients, using the same CCBT threshold, resulted in a sensitivity of 0.73 and a specificity of 0.75. The sensitivity was comparable to the SARS-CoV-2 RT PCR. DISCUSSION: Mathematically combining the blood tests has the potential to assist clinical acumen allowing for rapid streaming and more accurate patient flow pending definitive diagnosis. This may be of particular use in low-resource settings.","Parsons, I T; Parsons, A T; Balme, E; Hazell, G; Gifford, R; Stacey, M; Woods, D R; Russell-Jones, D",Ann Clin Biochem,479,1

This pathogenic virus has been identified in swabs performed on the throat and nose of patients who suffer from or are suspected of the disease. When COVI-19 infect the upper and lower respiratory tract it can cause mild or highly acute respiratory syndrome with consequent release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-1ß and IL-6. The binding of COVI-19 to the Toll Like Receptor (TLR) causes the release of pro-IL-1ß which is cleaved by caspase-1, followed by inflammasome activation and production of active mature IL-1ß which is a mediator of lung inflammation, fever and fibrosis. Suppression of pro-inflammatory IL-1 family members and IL-6 have been shown to have a therapeutic effect in many inflammatory diseases, including viral infections. Cytokine IL-37 has the ability to suppress innate and acquired immune response and also has the capacity to inhibit inflammation by acting on IL-18R&#945; receptor. IL-37 performs its immunosuppressive activity by acting on mTOR and increasing the adenosine monophosphate (AMP) kinase. This cytokine inhibits class II histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules and inflammation in inflammatory diseases by suppressing MyD88 and subsequently IL-1ß, IL-6, TNF and CCL2. The suppression of IL-1ß by IL-37 in inflammatory state induced by coronavirus-19 can have a new therapeutic effect previously unknown. Another inhibitory cytokine is IL-38, the newest cytokine of the IL-1 family members, produced by several immune cells including B cells and macrophages. IL-38 is also a suppressor cytokine which inhibits IL-1ß and other pro-inflammatory IL-family members. IL-38 is a potential therapeutic cytokine which inhibits inflammation in viral infections including that caused by coronavirus-19, providing a new relevant strategy.","Conti, P; Ronconi, G; Caraffa, A; Gallenga, C; Ross, R; Frydas, I; Kritas, S",J. biol. regul. homeost. agents,479,21

(Special issue on COVID-19.),21.1401,8.210599,2020,"BACKGROUND: Viral respiratory infections are the main causes of asthma exacerbation. The susceptibility of patients with asthma to develop an exacerbation when they present with severe pneumonia due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is unknown. The objective of this study was to investigate the characteristics and outcomes of asthmatic patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia who required hospitalisation during the spring 2020 outbreak in Paris, France. METHODS: A prospective cohort follow-up was carried out from 15 March to 15 April 2020 in Bicêtre Hospital, University Paris-Saclay, France. All hospitalised patients with a SARS-CoV-2 infection who reported a history of asthma were included. RESULTS: Among 768 hospitalised patients, 37 (4.8%) reported a history of asthma, which had been previously confirmed by a pulmonologist in 85% of cases. These asthmatic patients were mainly female (70%) and nonsmokers (85%), with a median age of 54â years (interquartile range (IQR) 42-67â years). None of them presented with an asthma exacerbation. 22 (59%) had major comorbidities and 31 (84%) had a body mass index &#8805;25â kg·m-2. The most common comorbidities were obesity (36%), hypertension (27%) and diabetes (19%). All patients had a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia on computed tomography of the chest. Eosinopenia was a typical biological feature with a median count of 0â cells·mm-3 (IQR 0-0â cells·mm-3). 11 patients (30%) were admitted into the intensive care unit, with three deaths (8.1%) occurring in the context of comorbidities. CONCLUSION: Asthma patients were not overrepresented among those with severe pneumonia due to SARS-CoV-2 infection who required hospitalisation. The worst outcomes were observed mainly in patients with major comorbidities.","Beurnier, Antoine; Jutant, Etienne-Marie; Jevnikar, Mitja; Boucly, Athénaïs; Pichon, Jérémie; Preda, Mariana; Frank, Marie; Laurent, Jérémy; Richard, Christian; Monnet, Xavier; Duranteau, Jacques; Harrois, Anatole; Chaumais, Marie-Camille; Bellin, Marie-France; Noël, Nicolas; Bulifon, Sophie; Jaïs, Xavier; Parent, Florence; Seferian, Andrei; Savale, Laurent; Sitbon, Olivier; Montani, David; Humbert, Marc",Eur. respir. j,479,26

We extend the SIR epidemiological model to include endogenous meeting rates. Individuals benefit from economic activity, but higher activity also leads to more interactions with potentially infected individuals. The main focus is a theoretical analysis of the contagion dynamics with a population of optimizing agents reacting myopically to the current disease prevalence. In the leading case, the infection prevalence is single-peaked. We obtain a simple condition for when several types of public-health interventions or changes in disease prevalence will paradoxically increase infection rates due to risk compensation. This condition implies that behavioral responses are most likely to undermine public-health interventions near the peak of severe diseases. We also derive an explicit formula for the behavior of a heterogeneous population. A key difference from the homogeneous case is that high-risk individuals may choose to temporarily stop all activity when they are likely to encounter infected low-risk individuals.","Dasaratha, Krishna",,479,8

Hospital length of stay (LOS) has been used as a surrogate marker for quality of care delivery. Longer duration of hospitalization can lead to increased morbidity, increased risk in hospital acquired infections, and can result in health related productivity loss for patients. The differences in hospital length of stay between various racial/ethnic groups has not been investigated in COVID-19. We explored these differences. Methods: We performed a nationwide registry study of US Hospital in 2020. We extracted the number of COVID-19 patients by race (Asian, African-American(AA), Caucasian) and also the patients who declined to provide race, as well those whose race was unavailable. We collected the case-mix index (CMI) for each hospital, the average length of stay (LOS) and the number of patients in each group. We applied multi-level, mixed-effects generalized linear models (GLM) to evaluate the average length of stay, adjusting for volume in cases and CMI, and a random-effect equation for each individual hospital which was deidentified and coded randomly. We back transformed the results to the original metric of LOS in days. Results: Among 583 US Hospitals, the average COVID-19 LOS was 8.5 days (95% CI 8-8.4). African Americans had an average LOS of 8.5 days (95% CI 8.1-8.8 days), Caucasians 8 days, (95% CI 7.6-8.3), while Asians 8.8 days (95% CI 8.4-9.2). Caucasians had an average of 0.5 days shorter LOS (95% -0.95 to -0.1, p=0.02). Asians had an average non-statistically significant 0.3 days longer LOS (95% CI -0.2 to 0.8, p=0.24). Conclusion: Our large nationwide sample of 583 US hospitals showed that African-American patients have longer hospital length of stay compared to Caucasian patients, after adjusting for the number of COVID-19 cases and the case mix index of each individual hospital. In our study, age, gender, and comorbidities were not adjusted for. There are a number of variables that could contribute to longer LOS for various racial/ethnic groups, including access to healthcare and healthcare utilization, health insurance status, wealth gaps, etc. Further investigation into social determinants of health and their impact on COVID-19 disease burden among various racial/ethnic groups is warranted.","Macmillan, A.; Kashiouris, M.

While vaccines constitute a vital part of the public health strategy to reduce the burden of COVID-19, the management of this disease will continue to rely heavily on pharmacotherapy. This study aims to provide an updated review of pharmacological agents that have been developed and/or repurposed for the treatment of COVID-19. To this end, a comprehensive literature search was conducted using the PubMed, Google Scholar, and LitCovid databases. Relevant clinical studies on drugs used in the management of COVID-19 were identified and evaluated in terms of evidence of efficacy and safety. To date, the FDA has approved three therapies for the treatment of COVID-19 Emergency Use Authorization: convalescent plasma, remdesivir, and casirivimab/imdevimab (REGN-COV2). Drugs such as lopinavir/ritonavir, umifenovir, favipiravir, anakinra, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, tocilizumab, interferons, tissue plasminogen activator, intravenous immunoglobulins, and nafamosat have been used off-label with mixed therapeutic results. Adjunctive administration of corticosteroids is also very common. The clinical experience with these approved and repurposed drugs is limited, and data on efficacy for the new indication are not strong. Overall, the response of the global scientific community to the COVID-19 pandemic has been impressive, as evident from the volume of scientific literature elucidating the molecular biology and pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 and the approval of three new drugs for clinical management. Reviewed studies have shown mixed data on efficacy and safety of the currently utilized drugs. The lack of standard treatment for COVID-19 has made it difficult to interpret results from most of the published studies due to the risk of attribution error. The long-term effects of drugs can only be assessed after several years of clinical experience;therefore, the efficacy and safety of current COVID-19 therapeutics should continue to be rigorously monitored as part of post-marketing studies.","Heustess, A.

This study examined whether serum Krebs von den Lungen-6 (KL-6) level is a useful biomarker for evaluating the severity of COVID-19. METHODS: We retrospectively examined patients diagnosed with COVID-19 at the Japanese Red Cross Medical Center between February 1, 2020, and May 15, 2020. Patients were divided into four categories based on clinical and radiological findings: mild, moderate, severe, and critical. Patients who presented with a mild or moderate illness and patients who started with or worsened to a severe or critical illness were classified as the non-severe and severe groups, respectively. The two groups were compared for patient characteristics, including serum KL-6 levels. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to define the optimum cut-off value of serum KL-6 level to evaluate COVID-19 severity. RESULTS: A total of 54 patients were enrolled, including 33 in the non-severe group and 21 in the severe group, of which four died. Compared with those in the non-severe group, more patients in the severe group were significantly older and had comorbidities. Serum KL-6 levels were significantly higher in the severe group than in the non-severe group both at diagnosis (median, 338 U/mL) and at peak levels within one week after diagnosis (median, 781 U/mL) (both p < 0.001). Serum KL-6 value at peak level (371 U/mL) was used as the optimal cut-off to evaluate disease severity (sensitivity, 85.7%; specificity, 96.6%). CONCLUSIONS: Serum KL-6 levels were significantly elevated in severe COVID-19 and is useful for evaluating its severity.","Awano, Nobuyasu; Inomata, Minoru; Kuse, Naoyuki; Tone, Mari; Takada, Kohei; Muto, Yutaka; Fujimoto, Kazushi; Akagi, Yu; Mawatari, Momoko; Ueda, Akihiro; Izumo, Takehiro",Respiratory investigation (Online),479,24

Various SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks in healthcare facilities have been reported. Healthcare workers (HCWs) may play a critical role in the spread of the virus, particularly when asymptomatic. We examined four healthcare-associated outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 infections that occurred at a university hospital in Berlin, Germany. We aimed to describe and analyze the spread of the virus in order to draw conclusions for effective containment of SARS-CoV-2 in healthcare facilities. METHODS: Healthcare-associated outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 infections were defined as two or more laboratory confirmed infections with SARS-CoV-2 where an epidemiological link within the healthcare setting appeared likely. We focused our analysis on one of three sites of the Charité-University Medicine hospital within a 2 month period (March and April 2020). RESULTS: We observed four healthcare-associated outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 infections, with a total of 24 infected persons (23 HCWs and one patient). The outbreaks were detected in the departments of nephrology and dialysis (n = 9), anesthesiology (n = 8), surgical pediatrics (n = 4), and neurology (n = 3). Each outbreak showed multiple unprotected contacts between infected HCWs. A combination of contact tracing, testing, physical distancing and mandatory continuous wearing of face masks by all HCWs was able to contain all four outbreaks. CONCLUSIONS: HCW to HCW transmission represented the likely source of the four outbreaks. Ensuring proper physical distancing measures and wearing of protective equipment, also when interacting with colleagues, must be a key aspect of fighting COVID-19 in healthcare facilities.","Schneider, Sandra; Piening, Brar; Nouri-Pasovsky, Pauline Assina; Krüger, Anne Caroline; Gastmeier, Petra; Aghdassi, Seven Johannes Sam",Antimicrob Resist Infect Control,479,16

Here, we investigate anticipatory and reactive effects of feature-based attention using separate fMRI and EEG recordings, while participants attended to one of two spatially overlapping visual features (motion and orientation). We focused on EEG source analysis of local neuronal rhythms and nested oscillations and on graph analysis of connectivity changes in a network of fMRI-defined regions of interest, and characterized a cascade of attentional effects at multiple spatial scales. We discuss how the results may reconcile several theories of selective attention, by showing how ß rhythms support anticipatory information routing through increased network efficiency, while reactive &#945;-band desynchronization patterns and increased &#945;-Î³ coupling in task-specific sensory areas mediate stimulus-evoked processing of task-relevant signals.","Pagnotta, Mattia F; Pascucci, David; Plomp, Gijs",Neuroimage,479,32

OBJECTIVES: Follow-up on the global publication activity within the course of the COVID-19 pandemic in a comparison of national contexts with regards to local infection rates and the involvement of the discipline of pathology. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Comparative analysis of the number of publications in the PubMed® database concerning COVID-19 with respect to publication type, date and place of publication, affiliation to an institute of pathology, and correlation with the number of SARS-CoV­2 infections over the same timeframe. RESULTS: After an initial peak with regards to the number of publications in the months of May and June 2020, a slight decrease was observed, followed by another increase starting in August/September 2020. Further, the time between data collection and publication contracted to approximately 3-4 months. Countries faced with early SARS-CoV­2 infections published promptly, even though there was no overall association between the number of publications and COVID-19 case numbers. On average, 4% of authors were affiliated to an institute of pathology, with a steady increase of this percentage within the course of the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 altered global publication activity by providing for an unprecedented number of publications combined with an acceleration of publication times irrespective of the geographical location and overall case numbers.","Strobl, Stephanie; Roth, Wilfried",Pathologe,479,20

It is known that, assuming $\mathsf{P} \neq \mathsf{NP}$ and the Unique Games Conjecture, the best polynomial time approximation algorithm for any CSP is given by solving and rounding a specific semidefinite programming relaxation. We prove an analogue of this result for algorithms that are definable as FPC-interpretations, which holds without the assumption that $\mathsf{P} \neq \mathsf{NP}$. While we are not able to drop (an FPC-version of) the Unique Games Conjecture as an assumption, we do present some partial results toward proving it. Specifically, we give a novel construction which shows that, for all $\alpha>0$, there exists a positive integer $q = \text{poly}(\frac{1}{\alpha})$ such that no there is no FPC-interpretation giving an $\alpha$-approximation of Unique Games on a label set of size $q$.","Tucker-Foltz, Jamie",,479,14

BACKGROUND: Cardiometabolic comorbidities are common in patients with severe COVID-19. Patients with HF may be particularly susceptible to COVID-19 complications. METHODS: The Premier Healthcare Database was used to identify patients with at least 1 HF hospitalization or 2 HF outpatient visits between January 1, 2019, and March 31, 2020, who were subsequently hospitalized between April and September 2020. Baseline characteristics, health care resource utilization, and mortality rates were compared between those hospitalized with COVID-19 and those hospitalized with other causes. Predictors of in-hospital mortality were identified in HF patients hospitalized with COVID-19 by using multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: Among 1,212,153 patients with history of HF, 132,312 patients were hospitalized from April 1, 2020, to September 30, 2020. A total of 23,843 patients (18.0%) were hospitalized with acute HF, 8,383 patients (6.4%) were hospitalized with COVID-19, and 100,068 patients (75.6%) were hospitalized with alternative reasons. Hospitalization with COVID-19 was associated with greater odds of in-hospital mortality as compared with hospitalization with acute HF; 24.2% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 died in-hospital compared to 2.6% of those hospitalized with acute HF. This association was strongest in April (adjusted odds ratio [OR]: 14.48; 95% confidence interval [CI]:12.25 to 17.12) than in subsequent months (adjusted OR: 10.11; 95% CI: 8.95 to 11.42; pinteraction <0.001). Among patients with HF hospitalized with COVID-19, male sex (adjusted OR: 1.26; 95% CI: 1.13 to 1.40) and morbid obesity (adjusted OR: 1.25; 95% CI: 1.07 to 1.46) were associated with greater odds of in-hospital mortality, along with age (adjusted OR: 1.35; 95% CI: 1.29 to 1.42 per 10 years) and admission earlier in the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with HF hospitalized with COVID-19 are at high risk for complications, with nearly 1 in 4 dying during hospitalization.","Bhatt, Ankeet S; Jering, Karola S; Vaduganathan, Muthiah; Claggett, Brian L; Cunningham, Jonathan W; Rosenthal, Ning; Signorovitch, James; Thune, Jens J; Vardeny, Orly; Solomon, Scott D",JACC Heart Fail,479,16

In this study, data from UK Biobank participants who were tested for COVID-19 infection (16 March to 7 September 2020) were used to explore the link between shift work and COVID-19 infection. Using the baseline occupational information, participants were categorised as non-shift workers, day shift workers, mixed shift workers and night shift workers. Multivariable regression models were used to assess the association between shift work and COVID-19 infection. Among the 18,221 participants (9.4% positive cases), 11.2% were health workers, and 16.4% were involved in shift-work-based jobs. Ethnic minorities (18%) and people in night-shift-based jobs (18.1%) had a significantly higher prevalence of COVID-19 infection than others. Adjusted logistics regression model suggest that, compared with their counterparts, people employed in a night-shift-based job were 1.85-fold (95% CI: 1.42-2.41) more likely to have COVID-19 infection. Sensitivity analysis focusing on people working in a non-healthcare setting suggests that people in shift-work-based jobs had 1.81-fold (95% CI: 1.04%-3.18%) higher odds of COVID-19 infection than their counterparts. Shift workers, particularly night shift workers, irrespective of their occupational group, seem to be at high risk of COVID-19 infection. If similar results are obtained from other studies, then it would mandate to revisit the criteria for defining high-risk groups for COVID-19 and implementing appropriate interventions to protect people in shift-based jobs.","Fatima, Yaqoot; Bucks, Romola S; Mamun, Abdullah A; Skinner, Isabelle; Rosenzweig, Ivana; Leschziner, Guy; Skinner, Timothy C",J Sleep Res,479,30

Few studies have attempted to calculate years of life lost (YLL) to COVID-19 and compare it with YLL due to other causes in different countries. METHODS: We calculated YLL to COVID-19 from week10 to week52 in 2020 for eight European countries by methods defined by the WHO. We calculated excess YLL by subtracting the average YLL from 2017 to 2019 to the YLL in 2020. Our analysis compared YLL to COVID-19 and the excess YLL of non-COVID-19 causes across countries in Europe. RESULTS: Portugal registered 394,573 cases and 6619 deaths due to COVID-19, accounting for 25,395 YLL in just 10 months. COVID-19 was responsible for 6.7% of all deaths but accounted for only 4.2% of all YLL. We estimate that Portugal experienced an excess of 35,510 YLL (+ 6.2%), of which 72% would have been due to COVID-19 and 28% due to non-COVID-19 causes. Spain, Portugal, and the Netherlands experienced excess YLL to non-COVID-19 causes. We also estimated that Portugal experienced an excess of 10,115 YLL due to cancer (3805), cardiovascular diseases (786) and diseases of the respiratory system (525). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 has had a major impact on mortality rates in Portugal, as well as in other European countries. The relative impact of COVID-19 on the number of deaths has been greater than on the number of YLL, because COVID-19 deaths occur mostly in advanced ages.","Vieira, André; Ricoca, Vasco Peixoto; Aguiar, Pedro; Sousa, Paulo; Nunes, Carla; Abrantes, Alexandre",BMC Public Health,479,23

The main adverse event of EST is bleeding and perforation and that of EPBD is post-endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) pancreatitis. To reduce these adverse events we employed minimal EST followed by papillary dilation (ESBD), and retrospectively evaluated its efficacy and safety compared with EST. Patients and Methods: CBDS patients who underwent EST (n = 114) or ESBD (n = 321) at Juntendo University Hospital from January 2009 to December 2018 were consecutively enrolled, retrospectively. The exclusion criteria were large-balloon dilation (&#8805; 12 mm), large CBDS (>12 mm), and previous EST/EPBD. We compared the overall stone removal rate, incidence of adverse event, procedure time, number of ERCP procedures, and rate of mechanical lithotripsy (ML) between the two groups. Results: Complete stone removal was successful in both ESBD and EST group. However, the rate of multiple ERCP sessions was significantly lower (35.1% vs. 12.8%, P < 0.001), procedure time was shorter (31.6 vs. 25.8 min, P = 0.01), and rate of ML was lower (16.7% vs. 7.8%, P = 0.01) in ESBD group. Bleeding was significantly more frequent in the EST group (9.6% vs. 1.2%, P < 0.001), particularly acute bleeding (7.9% vs. 0.9%, P < 0.001). Conclusions: ESBD is more efficient and safer in the management of CBD stones than EST. A prospective randomized study comparing ESBD with EST is needed to establish this combination technique.","Ishii, Shigeto; Fujisawa, Toshio; Ushio, Mako; Takahashi, Sho; Yamagata, Wataru; Takasaki, Yusuke; Suzuki, Akinori; Okawa, Yoshihiro; Ochiai, Kazushige; Tomishima, Ko; Kanazawa, Ryo; Saito, Hiroaki; Shiina, Shuichiro; Isayama, Hiroyuki",,479,22

This study analyzed whether different variables (executive functions and physical activity levels, gender and academic year) of 177 Spanish Compulsory Secondary School students contributed to their academic performance. The Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function 2 (BRIEF-2), Physical Activity Questionnaire for Adolescents (PAQ-A) and an ad hoc questionnaire were used to determine the students' executive functioning, physical activity level, gender and academic year, respectively. Students' grades were considered to be indicators of their academic achievement. Seven multiple linear regression models were constructed using the R computing language to examine the association between academic achievement (considered in each of the 5 subjects: Language, Mathematics, Geography and History, English and Physical Education; the mean of the instrumental subjects-Language and Mathematics-and the mean of all the subjects) and the independent variables. The results indicated that executive functions, physical activity and gender contributed to academic performance, but academic year did not. This suggests that students with good executive functions, who perform physical activity and are female, would have better academic achievement. This information should be considered when designing interventions to improve student academic achievement.","Escolano-Pérez, Elena; Bestué, Marta",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),479,1

In response to this Letter, the authors of Cumpstey et al (Feelisch, Cumpstey, Clarka, Santolinic and Jacksondargue) argue that what matters for human resilience against SARS-CoV-2 and other stressors is not simply determined by what is ingested/inhaled but also by how these substances can be handled by the body. The ability to cope with competing demands is determined by the extent to which the building blocks essential for cell/organ protection, function, adjustment and healing can continue to be made available in sufficient quantities. To this end, dietary quality and nutrient status are fundamental determinants of the metabolic background against which all of the factors (including over-the-counter medications such as paracetamol) operate and either support or compromise the balanced functioning of the reactive species interactome.","Verd, Sergio; Verd, Mateo",Antioxid. redox signal,479,29

The statistical properties of the models, in particular the correlation functions and the probability density functions, were duly computed. Our models take into account the adoption of lockdown measures as well as the crucial role of hospitals and health care institutes. To accomplish this work we adopt a kinetic-type reaction approach where the modelling of the lockdown measures is obtained by introducing a new mathematical basis and the intensity of the stochastic noise is derived by statistical mechanics. We analysed two scenarios: the stochastic SIS-model (Susceptible ⇒ Infectious ⇒ Susceptible) and the stochastic SIS-model integrated with the action of the hospitals;both models take into account the lockdown measures. We show that, for the case of the stochastic SIS-model, once the lockdown measures are removed, the Coronavirus infection will start growing again. However, the combined contributions of lockdown measures with the action of hospitals and health institutes is able to contain and even to dampen the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. This result may be used during a period of time when the massive distribution of vaccines in a given population is not yet feasible. We analysed data for USA and France. In the case of USA, we analysed the following situations: USA is subjected to the first wave of infection by Coronavirus and USA is in the second wave of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Due to the Covid-19, the whole world needs to sit on lockdown in different periods. Many things need to be done in all kinds of business including the education sector of countries. To sustain the education development teaching methods had to switch from traditional face-to-face teaching to online courses. The government made decisions in a short time and educational institutions had no time to prepare the materials for the online teaching. All courses of the Mongolian University of Pharmaceutical Sciences switched to online lessons. Challenges were raised before professors and tutors during online teaching. Our university did not have a specific learning management system for online teaching and e-learning. Therefore professors used different platforms for their online teaching such as Zoom, Microsoft teams for instance. Moreover, different social networking platforms played an active role in communication between students and professors. The situation is very difficult for professors and students. To measure the quality of online courses and to figure out the positive and weak points of online teaching we need an evaluation of e-learning. The focus of this paper is to share the evaluation process of e-learning based on a structure-oriented evaluation model.","Tudevdagva, Uranchimeg; Sodnom, Bazarragchaa; Erdenechimeg, Selenge",,479,16

The horses were housed in individual boxes, while the goats in two indoor pens, under natural photoperiod and natural environmental temperature. In each animal, skin temperature was recorded with the use of a digital infrared camera and a non-contact infrared thermometer, in five regions: neck, shoulder, ribs, flank and croup. Recorded values were compared with the well-established daily rhythm of rectal temperature. Rectal temperature was recorded at the same time by means of a digital thermometer. In horses, a lower value of skin temperature was recorded using the infrared thermometer for the croup region compared to shoulder and flank; a lower value of skin temperature was recorded using thermography for the croup region compared to the shoulder. In goats, a lower value of skin temperature was recorded using the infrared thermometer for the croup region compared to the flank. In both species, higher values of rectal temperature were observed, compared to the temperature recorded at the skin regions using the other two methodologies. Cosinor rhythmometry showed a daily rhythm of rectal and skin temperature recorded using both methodologies in all the examined regions. General linear model (GLM) showed statistically significant effect of breed on all rhythmic parameters; of day of monitoring on amplitude; of site of recording (rectal vs skin regions) on mesor, amplitude and acrophase; and no effect of methodologies used. The results of this study show the differences in rhythmicity of various body regions temperature and their differences in comparison with daily rhythm rectal temperature. The use of infrared methodologies was inaccurate in assessing body core temperature, but its use could be considered for the evaluation of inflammation in the different body sites.","Giannetto, Claudia; Arfuso, Francesca; Giudice, Elisabetta; Gianesella, Matteo; Fazio, Francesco; Panzera, Michele; Piccione, Giuseppe",J Therm Biol,479,24

The current method of detection involves a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)-based technique, which identifies the viral nucleic acids when present in sufficient quantity. False-negative results can be achieved and failure to quarantine the infected patient would be a major setback in containing the viral transmission. We aim to describe the time kinetics of various antibodies produced against the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and evaluate the potential of antibody testing to diagnose COVID-19. METHODS: The host humoral response against SARS-CoV-2, including IgA, IgM, and IgG response, was examined by using an ELISA-based assay on the recombinant viral nucleocapsid protein. 208 plasma samples were collected from 82 confirmed and 58 probable cases (qPCR negative but with typical manifestation). The diagnostic value of IgM was evaluated in this cohort. RESULTS: The median duration of IgM and IgA antibody detection was 5 (IQR, 3-6) days, while IgG was detected 14 (IQR, 10-18) days after symptom onset, with a positive rate of 85.4%, 92.7%, and 77.9%, respectively. In confirmed and probable cases, the positive rates of IgM antibodies were 75.6% and 93.1%, respectively. The detection efficiency by IgM ELISA is higher than that of qPCR after 5.5 days of symptom onset. The positive detection rate is significantly increased (98.6%) when combining IgM ELISA assay with PCR for each patient compared with a single qPCR test (51.9%). CONCLUSIONS: The humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 can aid in the diagnosis of COVID-19, including subclinical cases.","Guo, Li; Ren, Lili; Yang, Siyuan; Xiao, Meng; Chang, De; Yang, Fan; Dela Cruz, Charles S; Wang, Yingying; Wu, Chao; Xiao, Yan; Zhang, Lulu; Han, Lianlian; Dang, Shengyuan; Xu, Yan; Yang, Qi-Wen; Xu, Sheng-Yong; Zhu, Hua-Dong; Xu, Ying-Chun; Jin, Qi; Sharma, Lokesh; Wang, Linghang; Wang, Jianwei",Clin Infect Dis,479,16

Since then cold-atom gravity gradiometers, or matter-wave gravity gradiometers, had been under development at almost every physics department of top-rated universities around the globe. After another 30 years since the Kasevich and Chu publication in 1992, which had led to the first ever quantum gravity gradiometer, the corresponding research and development ceased from being profoundly active a few years back.

The pandemic may result in a long-term disproportionate negative impact to students applying to Medical School from a low-socioeconomic background. In addition, the upsurge in Medical School applications increases the likelihood of stricter University entry criteria over the coming years. There is no current research to determine how widening participation of Medicine to students from low-socioeconomic backgrounds can be improved virtually. The aim of this study is to establish the impact of COVID-19 on students enrolled in UK widening access schemes and the role of virtual student led initiatives in widening participation. METHODS: A voluntary online survey was distributed to UK Sixth Form students (N = 31) enrolled in a widening access scheme who attended Sheffield Neuroscience Society International Virtual Conference in February 2021. The event was free to attend. The five-domain survey consisted of questions determining demographics, career aspirations, impact of COVID-19, academic skillsets and an educational manipulation check. RESULTS: There were 30 pre-conference and 26 post-conference responses. 76.7 % had work experience cancelled due to COVID-19. A total of 36.7 % of participants reported participating in virtual work experience. 'Observe GP' and 'Medic Mentor' were each specified as attended virtual opportunities in 20 % of answers. Post conference, students felt significantly more confident in applying to Medical School (p = 0.008) and more prepared to undertake a presentation (p = 0.002). Educational manipulation check scores increased significantly (p = 0.003). 100 % of students felt inspired to do further CV building activities. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 has negatively impacted pupils enrolled in UK Medical School widening access schemes. Virtual student led initiatives can instill confidence in delegates from low socio-economic backgrounds, increase their career knowledge and inspire them to take part in further CV building exercises. Both Medical Schools and medical students play a key role in widening participation. This study recommends Medical Schools promote access to virtual events, urge private and state schools to declare offered opportunities and act mindfully when determining student's academic potential in the context of their socioeconomic and/or educational background.","Bligh, Emily R; Courtney, Ellie; Stirling, Rebecca; Rajananthanan, Asveny",BMC Med Educ,479,10

The article focuses on the factors associated with social vulnerability. The results of the survey data show that men, working age people and entrepreneurs are the least concerned about the threat of COVID-19. At the same time, statistics show that economically active people and those living in more crowded households are the most vulnerable to the spread of infection. The results of this study point to the greatest discrepancies between objectively assessed and subjectively perceived vulnerabilities, thus helping decision-makers to optimise their efforts and manage the risk of COVID-19 more effectively, prioritising those areas where vulnerabilities are the highest.","Telesiene, A.; Balzekiene, A.; Budzyte, A.; Zolubiene, E.",Filosofija-Sociologija,479,1

The impact of COVID-19 on urological services in different geographical areas is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the global impact of COVID-19 on urological providers and the provision of urological patient care. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A cross-sectional, web-based survey was conducted from March 30, 2020 to April 7, 2020. A 55-item questionnaire was developed to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on various aspects of urological services. Target respondents were practising urologists, urology trainees, and urology nurses/advanced practice providers. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The primary outcome was the degree of reduction in urological services, which was further stratified by the geographical location, degree of outbreak, and nature and urgency of urological conditions. The secondary outcome was the duration of delay in urological services. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: A total of 1004 participants responded to our survey, and they were mostly based in Asia, Europe, North America, and South America. Worldwide, 41% of the respondents reported that their hospital staff members had been diagnosed with COVID-19 infection, 27% reported personnel shortage, and 26% had to be deployed to take care of COVID-19 patients. Globally, only 33% of the respondents felt that they were given adequate personal protective equipment, and many providers expressed fear of going to work (47%). It was of concerning that 13% of the respondents were advised not to wear a surgical face mask for the fear of scaring their patients, and 21% of the respondents were advised not to discuss COVID-19 issues or concerns on media. COVID-19 had a global impact on the cut-down of urological services, including outpatient clinic appointments, outpatient investigations and procedures, and urological surgeries. The degree of cut-down of urological services increased with the degree of COVID-19 outbreak. On average, 28% of outpatient clinics, 30% of outpatient investigations and procedures, and 31% of urological surgeries had a delay of >8 wk. Urological services for benign conditions were more affected than those for malignant conditions. Finally, 47% of the respondents believed that the accumulated workload could be dealt with in a timely manner after the COVID-19 outbreak, but 50% thought the postponement of urological services would affect the treatment and survival outcomes of their patients. One of the limitations of this study is that Africa, Australia, and New Zealand were under-represented. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 had a profound global impact on urological care and urology providers. The degree of cut-down of urological services increased with the degree of COVID-19 outbreak and was greater for benign than for malignant conditions. One-fourth of urological providers were deployed to assist with COVID-19 care. Many providers reported insufficient personal protective equipment and support from hospital administration. PATIENT SUMMARY: Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) has led to significant delay in outpatient care and surgery in urology, particularly in regions with the most COVID-19 cases. A considerable proportion of urology health care professionals have been deployed to assist in COVID-19 care, despite the perception of insufficient training and protective equipment.","Teoh, Jeremy Yuen-Chun; Ong, William Lay Keat; Gonzalez-Padilla, Daniel; Castellani, Daniele; Dubin, Justin M; Esperto, Francesco; Campi, Riccardo; Gudaru, Kalyan; Talwar, Ruchika; Okhunov, Zhamshid; Ng, Chi-Fai; Jain, Nitesh; Gauhar, Vineet; Wong, Martin Chi-Sang; Wroclawski, Marcelo Langer; Tanidir, Yiloren; Rivas, Juan Gomez; Tiong, Ho-Yee; Loeb, Stacy",Eur Urol,479,23

We sought to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 in the overall screening for acute stroke utilizing a commercial clinical artificial intelligence platform. METHODS: Data were derived from the Viz Platform, an artificial intelligence application designed to optimize the workflow of patients with acute stroke. Neuroimaging data on suspected patients with stroke across 97 hospitals in 20 US states were collected in real time and retrospectively analyzed with the number of patients undergoing imaging screening serving as a surrogate for the amount of stroke care. The main outcome measures were the number of computed tomography (CT) angiography, CT perfusion, large vessel occlusions (defined according to the automated software detection), and severe strokes on CT perfusion (defined as those with hypoperfusion volumes >70 mL) normalized as number of patients per day per hospital. Data from the prepandemic (November 4, 2019 to February 29, 2020) and pandemic (March 1 to May 10, 2020) periods were compared at national and state levels. Correlations were made between the inter-period changes in imaging screening, stroke hospitalizations, and thrombectomy procedures using state-specific sampling. RESULTS: A total of 23 223 patients were included. The incidence of large vessel occlusion on CT angiography and severe strokes on CT perfusion were 11.2% (n=2602) and 14.7% (n=1229/8328), respectively. There were significant declines in the overall number of CT angiographies (-22.8%; 1.39-1.07 patients/day per hospital, P<0.001) and CT perfusion (-26.1%; 0.50-0.37 patients/day per hospital, P<0.001) as well as in the incidence of large vessel occlusion (-17.1%; 0.15-0.13 patients/day per hospital, P<0.001) and severe strokes on CT perfusion (-16.7%; 0.12-0.10 patients/day per hospital, P<0.005). The sampled cohort showed similar declines in the rates of large vessel occlusions versus thrombectomy (18.8% versus 19.5%, P=0.9) and comprehensive stroke center hospitalizations (18.8% versus 11.0%, P=0.4). CONCLUSIONS: A significant decline in stroke imaging screening has occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic.

In this context, focusing on the proteome of Trypanosoma cruzi, we investigated the link between the probabilities for pathogen peptides to be presented on a cell surface and their distance from human self. We found a reasonable but, as far as we know, undiscovered property: the farther the distance between a peptide and the human-self the higher the probability for that peptide to be presented on a cell surface. We also found that the most distant peptides from human self bind, on average, a broader collection of HLAs than expected, implying a potential immunological role in a large portion of individuals. Finally, introducing a novel quantitative indicator for a peptide to measure its potential immunological role, we proposed a pool of peptides that could be potential epitopes and that can be suitable for experimental testing.

Failure to distinguish the 2 diseases may increase the risk of transmission. A fast and convenient differential diagnosis between COVID-19 and influenza has significant clinical value, especially for low- and middle-income countries with a shortage of nucleic acid detection kits. We aimed to establish a diagnostic model to differentiate COVID-19 and influenza based on clinical data. MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 493 patients were enrolled in the study, including 282 with COVID-19 and 211 with influenza. All data were collected and reviewed retrospectively. The clinical and laboratory characteristics of all patients were analyzed and compared. We then randomly divided all patients into development sets and validation sets to establish a diagnostic model using multivariate logistic regression analysis. Finally, we validated the diagnostic model using the validation set. RESULTS We preliminarily established a diagnostic model for differentiating COVID-19 from influenza that consisted of 5 variables: age, dry cough, fever, white cell count, and D-dimer. The model showed good performance for differential diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS This initial model including clinical features and laboratory indices effectively differentiated COVID-19 from influenza. Patients with a high score were at a high risk of having COVID-19, while patients with a low score were at a high risk of having influenza. This model could help clinicians quickly identify and isolate cases in the absence of nucleic acid tests, especially during the cocirculation of COVID-19 and influenza. Owing to the study's retrospective nature, further prospective study is needed to validate the accuracy of the model.","Li, Jingwen; Li, Simin; Qiu, Xiaoming; Zhu, Wenyan; Li, Linfeng; Qin, Bo",Med Sci Monit,479,22

Mortality and case-fatality rates vary widely depending on incidence of COVID-19 and the testing policy in affected countries. To date, data comparing hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and influenza is scarce. METHODS: Data from patients with COVID-19 were compared to patients infected with influenza A (InfA) and B (InfB) virus during the 2017/18 and 2018/19 seasons. All patients were &#8805; 18 years old, had PCR-confirmed infection and needed hospital treatment. Demographic data, medical history, length-of-stay (LOS), complications including in-hospital mortality were analyzed. RESULTS: In total, 142 patients with COVID-19 were compared to 266 patients with InfA and 300 with InfB. Differences in median age (COVID-19 70.5 years vs InfA 70 years and InfB 77 years, p < 0.001) and laboratory results were observed. COVID-19 patients had fewer comorbidities, but complications (respiratory insufficiency, pneumonia, acute kidney injury, acute heart failure and death) occurred more frequently. Median length-of-stay (LOS) was longer in COVID-19 patients (12 days vs InfA 7 days vs. InfB 7 days, p < 0.001). There was a fourfold higher in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients (23.2%) when compared with InfA (5.6%) or InfB (4.7%; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: In hospitalized patients, COVID-19 is associated with longer LOS, a higher number of complications and higher in-hospital mortality compared to influenza, even in a population with fewer co-morbidities. This data, a high reproduction number and limited treatment options, alongside excess mortality during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, support the containment strategies implemented by most authorities.","Erich, Pawelka; Mario, Karolyi; Theresa, Mader; Sara, Omid; Hasan, Kelani; Sebastian, Baumgartner; Sarah, Ely; Wolfgang, Hoepler; Bernd, Jilma; Franz, Koenig; Hermann, Laferl; Marianna, Traugott; Michael, Turner; Tamara, Seitz; Christoph, Wenisch; Alexander, Zoufaly",Infection,479,14

In this study, we examined the effects of endothelial-specific HDAC2 overexpression on endothelial-dependent vasorelaxation and atherogenesis in vivo. METHODS: Endothelial-specific HDAC2-overexpressing transgenic mice (HDAC2-Tg) were generated under control of the Tie2 promoter. An atherosclerosis model was produced by injecting HDAC2-Tg and wild-type (WT) mice with adeno-associated virus encoding a PCSK9 gain-of-function mutant under control of a liver-specific promoter and feeding them a high-fat diet for 12 weeks. Aortic stiffness in vivo was determined by measuring pulse wave velocity. Wire myography was used to measure endothelium dependent (acetylcholine) and independent (sodium nitroprusside) relaxation in isolated mice aortas. Atherosclerotic plaque burden in aortas was determined by Oil Red O staining and protein expression was determined by western blotting. RESULTS: At baseline, HDAC2-Tg mice had normal mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) and body weight, but pulse wave velocity (PWV), an inverse measure of vascular health and stiffness, was decreased, suggesting that their vessels were more compliant. Moreover, basal nitric oxide production was enhanced in the vessels of HDAC2-Tg mice as compared to that in WT controls, although no significant differences in acetylcholine (endothelial component)- or sodium nitroprusside (non-endothelial component)-mediated relaxation were observed. However, after exposure to OxLDL, aortas from HDAC2-Tg mice exhibited greater acetylcholine-induced relaxation than did those from WT mice. Thus, endothelial-specific vasodilator production was enhanced despite oxidative injury. Atherosclerosis induction in WT mice led to a significant increase in PWV, but in HDAC2-Tg mice, PWV and MAP remained unchanged. Further, aortic rings from HDAC2-Tg exhibited better endothelial-dependent vascular relaxation than did those from WT mice, but not when treated with nitric oxide synthase inhibitor L-NAME. Finally, plaque burden, determined by Oil red O staining, was significantly increased in WT, but not HDAC2-Tg mice, subjected to the atherogenic model. Deletion of endothelial HDAC2 led to impaired endothelial cell-dependent vascular relaxation and increased PWV, compared with those in littermate controls. CONCLUSION: HDAC2 protects against endothelial dysfunction and atherogenesis induced by oxidized lipids. Hence, overexpression or activation of HDAC2 represents a novel therapy for endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis. HDAC2-Tg mice provide an opportunity to determine the role of endothelial HDAC2 in vascular endothelial homeostasis.","Hori, Daijiro; Nomura, Yohei; Nakano, Mitsunori; Han, Mingming; Bhatta, Anil; Chen, Ke; Akiyoshi, Kei; Pandey, Deepesh",Cell Physiol Biochem,479,24

Compared to other diagnosis methodologies, chest X-ray (CXR) imaging is an advantageous tool since it is fast, low-cost, and easily accessible. Thus, CXR has a great potential not only to help diagnose COVID-19 but also to track the progression of the disease. Numerous studies have proposed to use Deep Learning techniques for COVID-19 diagnosis. However, they have used very limited CXR image repositories for evaluation with a small number, a few hundreds, of COVID-19 samples. Moreover, these methods can neither localize nor grade the severity of COVID-19 infection. For this purpose, recent studies proposed to explore the activation maps of deep networks. However, they remain inaccurate for localizing the actual infestation making them unreliable for clinical use. This study proposes a novel method for the joint localization, severity grading, and detection of COVID-19 from CXR images by generating the so-called infection maps that can accurately localize and grade the severity of COVID-19 infection. To accomplish this, we have compiled the largest COVID-19 dataset up to date with 2951 COVID-19 CXR images, where the annotation of the ground-truth segmentation masks is performed on CXRs by a novel collaborative expert human-machine approach. Furthermore, we publicly release the first CXR dataset with the ground-truth segmentation masks of the COVID-19 infected regions. A detailed set of experiments show that state-of-the-art segmentation networks can learn to localize COVID-19 infection with an F1-score of 85.81%, that is significantly superior to the activation maps created by the previous methods. Finally, the proposed approach achieved a COVID-19 detection performance with 98.37% sensitivity and 99.16% specificity.","Degerli, Aysen; Ahishali, Mete; Yamac, Mehmet; Kiranyaz, Serkan; Chowdhury, Muhammad E.

Hence, we implemented an innovative online and remote pathology curriculum, anchored on virtual microscopy and Zoom videoconferencing: ideal tools to support online teaching. Objective: To assess a new curriculum implementation at Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar. Materials and Methods: This for-credit, 2-week elective included 6 synchronous Zoom sessions where complex clinicopathological cases were discussed in small groups. We used open access digital microscopy slides from the University of Leeds' Virtual Pathology Library (http://www.virtualpathology.leeds.ac.uk/slides/library/). Students independently prepared for these sessions by reviewing cases, slides, readings, and questions in advance (asynchronous self-directed learning anchored on a flipped classroom model), and wrote a final review of a case. An assessment and feedback were given to each student. Results: Four elective iterations were offered to a total of 29 students, with learners and faculty spread over 4 countries. During the Zoom sessions, students controlled the digital slides and offered their own diagnoses, followed by group discussions to strengthen autonomy and confidence. We surveyed learners about the elective's performance (program evaluation). Students conveyed high levels of satisfaction about the elective's overall quality, their pathology learning and online interactions, with minimal challenges related to the remote nature of the course. Discussion and Conclusions: Technological innovations mitigate sudden disruptions in medical education. A remote curriculum allows instruction at any distance, at any time, from anywhere, enhancing educational exchanges, flexibility and globalization in medical education.","Guiter, Gerardo E; Sapia, Sandra; Wright, Alexander I; Hutchins, Gordon G A; Arayssi, Thurayya",Med Sci Educ,479,16

As the COVID-19 pandemic has continued to spread globally, increasing numbers of pregnant women have become infected, raising concern not only for their health but also for the health of their infants. This chapter discusses the effects of coronavirus infections, e.g., MERS, SARS, and COVID 19, on pregnancy and describes the evolving knowledge of COVID 19 among pregnant women. The physiological changes that occur in pregnancy, especially changes in the immune system, are reviewed in terms of their effect on susceptibility to infectious diseases. The effects of COVID-19 on the placenta, fetus, and neonate are also reviewed, including potential clinical outcomes and issues relating to testing and diagnosis. The potential mechanisms of vertical transmission of the virus between pregnant women and their infants are analyzed, including intrauterine, intrapartum, and postpartum infections. Several recent studies have reported the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in tissues from the fetal side of the placenta, permitting the diagnosis of transplacental infection of the fetus by SARS-CoV-2.

METHODS: Latent class analysis were used to explore the optimal numbers of clusters. Multinomial logistic regression and multiple correspondence analysis were used to analyze the demographic variables of the latent categories. MANOVA was used to analyze the difference of knowledge of COVID-19 obtained among clusters and their psychological status, and chi-square test was used determine the relationship between the latent clusters and the participant's COVID-19 worry level. RESULTS: Five clusters were found: the first cluster (n = 120, 39%) was unthreatened and confident. Cluster 2(n = 84, 28%) was unthreatened but not confident. Cluster 3 (n = 49, 17%) was threatened but confident. Cluster 4 (n = 25, 9%) was threaten, not confident and knowledgeable, and Cluster 5 (n = 20, 7%) was threatened, not confident and lacking knowledge. Three demographic variables were shown an effect on the classification, they were support from work, family support and intrapartum and postpartum complications. CONCLUSION: This study can help assess the mental health risks of pregnant women during an epidemic. The results could be helpful for families, work units, communities and medical institutions to make targeted intervention decisions for pregnant women.","Qi, Mengsha; Li, Xiaozhe; Liu, Shuyun; Li, Yonghong; Huang, Wei",PLoS One,479,1

Due to the multi-targeted nature of the virus, it is clear that drugs providing anti-COVID-19 effects need to be developed at an accelerated rate, and a combinatorial approach may stand to be more successful than a single drug therapy. Among several targets and pathways that are under investigation, the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and specifically angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), and Ca2+-mediated SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry and replication are noteworthy. A combination of ACE inhibitors and calcium channel blockers (CCBs), a critical line of therapy for pulmonary hypertension, has shown therapeutic relevance in COVID-19 when investigated independently. To that end, we conducted in silico modeling using BIOiSIM, an AI-integrated mechanistic modeling platform by utilizing known preclinical in vitro and in vivo datasets to accurately simulate systemic therapy disposition and site-of-action penetration of the CCBs and ACEi compounds to tissues implicated in COVID-19 pathogenesis.","Chakravarty, Kaushik; Antontsev, Victor G; Khotimchenko, Maksim; Gupta, Nilesh; Jagarapu, Aditya; Bundey, Yogesh; Hou, Hypatia; Maharao, Neha; Varshney, Jyotika",Molecules (Basel),479,18

However, due to the great volatility and uncertainty of natural wind, wind power also fluctuates, seriously affecting the reliability of wind power system and bringing challenges to large-scale grid connection of wind power. Wind speed prediction is very important to ensure the safety and stability of wind power generation system. In this paper, a new wind speed prediction scheme is proposed. First, improved hybrid mode decomposition is used to decompose the wind speed data into the trend part and the fluctuation part, and the noise is decomposed twice. Then wavelet analysis is used to decompose the trend part and the fluctuation part for the third time. The decomposed data are classified. The long- and short-term memory neural network optimized by the improved particle swarm optimization algorithm is used to train the nonlinear sequence and noise sequence, and the autoregressive moving average model is used to train the linear sequence. Finally, the final prediction results were reconstructed. This paper uses this system to predict the wind speed data of China's Changma wind farm and Spain's Sotavento wind farm. By experimenting with the real data from two different wind farms and comparing with other predictive models, we found that (1) by improving the mode number selection in the variational mode decomposition, the characteristics of wind speed data can be better extracted. (2) According to the different characteristics of component data, the combination method is selected to predict modal components, which makes full use of the advantages of different algorithms and has good prediction effect. (3) The optimization algorithm is used to optimize the neural network, which solves the problem of parameter setting when establishing the prediction model. (4) The combination forecasting model proposed in this paper has clear structure and accurate prediction results. The research work in this paper will help to promote the development of wind energy prediction field, help wind farms formulate wind power regulation strategies, and further promote the construction of green energy structure.","Zhang, Yagang; Li, Ruixuan; Zhang, Jinghui",,479,14

STUDY DESIGN: This is an observational study wherein public health surveillance systems are evaluated. METHODS: Data were collected in the Public Health England's Second-Generation Surveillance System through routine laboratory reporting processes, as well as via enhanced testing in collaboration with commercial partners. Three periods were chosen to present developments in disease surveillance around the first pandemic wave in England. Completeness of valid entries for key demographic and epidemiological fields was summarised. Timeliness was assessed using recorded date intervals: from sample collection to the laboratory reporting a positive result, the positive result being received by the national surveillance system and the data being available for epidemiological analysis. RESULTS: In each period, demographic variables were more than 95% complete and enhanced ethnicity more than 85%, allowing a rich understanding of the general characteristics of COVID-19 cases in England. The proportion of cases completing all reporting stages of the national system within 3 days of when the specimen was taken increased from 69.1% in period 1 to 76.6% in period 3. In period 3, the median number of days to complete all reporting stages decreased to 2, from 3 in previous periods. Analysis of each reporting stage offers suggestive evidence that timeliness of the system has improved as reporting has become established over time. CONCLUSIONS: Timely processing of data for epidemiological use was consistent and rapid once received by the national system. Delays in timeliness were most likely to occur in the first stage of the reporting process, before laboratory input to the surveillance platform. Existing national surveillance mechanisms enhanced during the response have succeeded in providing rapid collection and reporting of case data to facilitate epidemiological monitoring and analysis and guide public health policy and strategy.","Clare, T; Twohig, K A; O039,; Connell, A-M; Dabrera, G",Public Health,479,1

However, data concerning the epidemiological features, viral shedding, and antibody dynamics between asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers and COVID-19 patients remain controversial. METHODS: We enrolled 193 SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects in Ningbo and Zhoushan, Zhejiang, China, from January 21 to March 6, 2020. All subjects were followed up to monitor the dynamics of serum antibody immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG against SARS-CoV-2 using colloidal gold-labeled and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. RESULTS: Of those, 31 were asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers, 148 symptomatic COVID-19 patients, and 14 presymptomatic COVID-19 patients. Compared to symptomatic COVID-19 patients, asymptomatic carriers were younger and had higher levels of white blood cell and lymphocyte, lower level of C-reactive protein, and shorter viral shedding duration. Conversion of IgM from positive to negative was shorter in asymptomatic carriers than in COVID-19 patients (7.5 vs. 25.5 days, P = 0.030). The proportion of those persistently seropositive for IgG against SARS-CoV-2 was higher in COVID-19 patients than in asymptomatic carriers (66.1% vs. 33.3%, P = 0.037). Viral load was higher in symptomatic patients than presymptomatic patients (P = 0.003) and asymptomatic carriers (P = 0.004). Viral shedding duration was longer in presymptomatic COVID-19 patients than in asymptomatic carriers (48.0 vs. 24.0 days, P = 0.002). Asymptomatic carriers acquired infection more from intra-familial transmission than did COVID-19 patients (89.0% vs. 61.0%, P = 0.028). In 4 familial clusters of SARS-CoV-2 infection, asymptomatic carriers were mainly children and young adults while severe COVID-19 was mainly found in family members older than 60 years with comorbidities. CONCLUSION: Asymptomatic carriers might have a higher antiviral immunity to clear SARS-CoV-2 than symptomatic COVID-19 patients and this antiviral immunity should be contributable to innate and adaptive cellular immunity rather than humoral immunity. The severity of COVID-19 is associated with older age and comorbidities in familial clustering cases.","Chen, Yi; Li, Ping; Ding, Yibo; Liu, Miao; Liu, Leijie; Yi, Bo; Wu, Ting; Dong, Hongjun; Lao, Xuying; Ding, Keqing; Wang, Haibo; Zhang, Dongliang; Tan, Xiaojie; Wang, Zhongfa; Xu, Guozhang; Cao, Guangwen",J Infect Public Health,479,20

These measures carry a high economic and social cost, and might have little effect on COVID-19 epidemics if there are many more cases resulting from local transmission compared with imported cases. Our study aims to investigate the extent to which imported cases contribute to local transmission under different epidemic conditions. METHODS: To inform decisions about international travel restrictions, we calculated the ratio of expected COVID-19 cases from international travel (assuming no travel restrictions) to expected cases arising from internal spread, expressed as a proportion, on an average day in May and September, 2020, in each country. COVID-19 prevalence and incidence were estimated using a modelling framework that adjusts reported cases for under-ascertainment and asymptomatic infections. We considered different travel scenarios for May and September, 2020: an upper bound with estimated travel volumes at the same levels as May and September, 2019, and a lower bound with estimated travel volumes adjusted downwards according to expected reductions in May and September, 2020. Results were interpreted in the context of local epidemic growth rates. FINDINGS: In May, 2020, imported cases are likely to have accounted for a high proportion of total incidence in many countries, contributing more than 10% of total incidence in 102 (95% credible interval 63-129) of 136 countries when assuming no reduction in travel volumes (ie, with 2019 travel volumes) and in 74 countries (33-114) when assuming estimated 2020 travel volumes. Imported cases in September, 2020, would have accounted for no more than 10% of total incidence in 106 (50-140) of 162 countries and less than 1% in 21 countries (4-71) when assuming no reductions in travel volumes. With estimated 2020 travel volumes, imported cases in September, 2020, accounted for no more than 10% of total incidence in 125 countries (65-162) and less than 1% in 44 countries (8-97). Of these 44 countries, 22 (2-61) had epidemic growth rates far from the tipping point of exponential growth, making them the least likely to benefit from travel restrictions. INTERPRETATION: Countries can expect travellers infected with SARS-CoV-2 to arrive in the absence of travel restrictions. Although such restrictions probably contribute to epidemic control in many countries, in others, imported cases are likely to contribute little to local COVID-19 epidemics. Stringent travel restrictions might have little impact on epidemic dynamics except in countries with low COVID-19 incidence and large numbers of arrivals from other countries, or where epidemics are close to tipping points for exponential growth. Countries should consider local COVID-19 incidence, local epidemic growth, and travel volumes before implementing such restrictions.

The subsequent loneliness and concerns of the pandemic during social distancing, quarantine, and lockdown are psychosocial stressors that negatively affect the immune system. These effects occur through mechanisms controlled by the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis that alter immune regulation, namely the conserved transcriptional response to adversity (CTRA), which promotes inflammation and diminishes antiviral responses, leading to inadequate protection against viral disease. Unhealthy eating habits, physical inactivity, sleep disturbances, and mental health consequences of COVID-19 add on to the pathological effects of loneliness, making immunity against this ferocious virus an even tougher fight. Therefore, social isolation, with its unintended consequences, has inherently paradoxical effects on immunity in relation to viral disease. Though this paradox can present a challenge, its acknowledgment can serve as an opportunity to address the associated issues and find ways to mitigate the adverse effects. In this review, we aim to explore, in detail, the pathological effects of the new social norms on immunity and present suggested methods to improve our physical, psychological, and healthcare abilities to fight viral infection in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Pourriyahi, Homa; Saghazadeh, Amene; Rezaei, Nima",J Neuroimmunol,479,22

To seek more effective VOCs control strategies, we investigated 107 VOC species in a typical coastal city (Beihai) of South China, from August to November 2018. Meanwhile, a high-resolution anthropogenic VOCs monthly emission inventory (EI) was established for 2018. For source apportionments (SAs) reliability, comparisons of source structures derived from positive matrix factorization (PMF) and EI were made mainly in terms of reaction losses, uncertainties and specific ratios. Finally, for the source-end control, a comprehensive reactivity control index (RCI) was established by combing SAs with reactive speciation profiles. Ambient measurements showed that the average concentration of VOCs was 26.38 ppbv, dominated by alkanes (36.7%) and oxygenated volatile organic compounds (OVOCs) (29.4%). VOC reactivity was estimated using ozone formation potential (52.35 ppbv) and propylene-equivalent concentration (4.22 ppbv). EI results displayed that the entire VOC, OFP, and propylene-equivalent emissions were 40.98 Gg, 67.98 Gg, and 105.93 Gg, respectively. Comparisons of source structures indicated that VOC SAs agreed within ±100% between two perspectives. Both PMF and EI results showed that petrochemical industry (24.0% and 33.0%), food processing and associated combustion (19.1% and 29.2%) were the significant contributors of anthropogenic VOCs, followed by other industrial processes (22.2% and 13.3%), transportation (18.9% and 12.0%), and solvent utilization (9.1% and10.5%). Aimed at VOCs abatement according to RCI: for terminal control, fifteen ambient highly reactive species (predominantly alkenes and alkanes) were targeted; for source control, the predominant anthropogenic sources (food industry, solvent usage, petrochemical industry and transportation) and their emitted highly reactive species were determined. Particularly, with low levels of ambient VOC and primary emissions, in this VOC and NOx double-controlled regime, crude disorganized emission from food industry contributed a high RCI.","Fu, Shuang; Guo, Meixiu; Luo, Jinmin; Han, Deming; Chen, Xiaojia; Jia, Haohao; Jin, Xiaodan; Liao, Haoxiang; Wang, Xin; Fan, Linping; Cheng, Jinping",Sci Total Environ,479,10

METHODS: An online survey was conceived and circulated to members of the Indonesian Society of Digestive Surgeons. The survey was conducted in two phases, in April 2020 and July 2020, to evaluate changes in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Early in the pandemic (April 2020), the median number of major digestive surgeries performed monthly declined from 20 cases (range. 3-100 cases) to 1 case (range. 0-10 cases) (P < .001; Wilcoxon signed-rank test). Most of the cases in April 2020 addressed emergency problems, but more definitive surgeries were performed during the later period of the survey. The importance of screening for COVID-19 with polymerase chain reaction has increased over time, and a more comprehensive screening methodology incorporating real-time polymerase chain reaction, chest CT, and rapid antibody test were evident in 31.37% of July 2020 responses.

However, it is currently unknown if obesity plays a role in the clinical manifestations and prognosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infected patients. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether obesity played a role in clinical manifestations and prognosis in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: This is a retrospective multicenter clinical study. A total of 96 patients hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled from Dongguan People's Hospital, Nanfang hospital and the First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University between 23 January and 14 February 2020. Demographic and clinical data were extracted from medical records. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was defined as oxygenation index (PaO2/FiO2) &#8804; 300 mmHg. We grouped patients through the body mass index (BMI). Associations were examined using the t test, &#967;2 test and multivariate logistic forward regression test. RESULTS: Patients with BMI < 24 were significantly younger (P = 0.025) with lower creatine kinase (P = 0.013), lower diastolic pressure blood (P = 0.035), lower serum creatinine (P = 0.012), lower lactate dehydrogenase (P = 0.001) and higher platelet count (P = 0.002). The BMI level was 20.78 ± 3.15 in patients without pneumonia compared with the patients with pneumonia (23.81 ± 3.49, P = 0.001). For patients without ARDS, an average BMI level of 22.65 ± 3.53 was observed, significantly lower than patients with ARDS (24.57 ± 3.59, P = 0.022). The mean BMI was 22.35 ± 3.56 in patients experienced with relieving the clinical symptoms or stable condition by radiographic tests, lower than patients with disease exacerbation with 24.89 ± 3.17 (P = 0.001). In addition, lymphocyte count (r = - 0.23, P = 0.027) and platelet count (r = - 0.44, P < 0.001) were negatively correlated with BMI. While hemoglobin (r = 0.267, P = 0.008), creatine kinase (r = 0.331, P = 0.001), serum creatinine (r = 0.424, P < 0.001) and lactate dehydrogenase (r = 0.343, P = 0.001) were significantly positive correlated with BMI. Multivariate analysis showed that older age (OR = 1.046, P = 0.009) and BMI &#8805; 24 (OR = 1.258, P = 0.005) were independent risk factors associated ICU admission while BMI &#8805; 24 (OR = 4.219, P = 0.007) was independent risk factor associated with radiographic disease exacerbation. CONCLUSIONS: Our study found BMI was significantly associated with clinical manifestations and prognosis of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Adverse outcomes with COVID-19 have been linked to cytokine storm but the most effective way to address exaggerated inflammatory response is complex and unclear. The Expert Working Group on the Commission of Human Medicines in the UK and other organizations have stated that there is insufficient evidence to establish a link between ibuprofen and susceptibility to or exacerbation of COVID-19. NSAID use must also be categorized by whether the drugs are relatively low-dose over-the-counter oral products taken occasionally versus higher-dose or parenteral NSAIDs. Even if evidence emerged arguing for or against NSAIDs in this setting, it is unclear if this evidence would apply to all NSAIDs at all doses in all dosing regimens. Paracetamol (acetaminophen) has been proposed as an alternative to NSAIDs but there are issues with liver toxicity at high doses. There are clearly COVID-19 cases where NSAIDs should not be used, but there is no strong evidence that NSAIDs must be avoided in all patients with COVID-19; clinicians must weigh these choices on an individual basis.","Pergolizzi, Joseph V; Varrassi, Giustino; Magnusson, Peter; LeQuang, Jo Ann; Paladini, Antonella; Taylor, Robert; Wollmuth, Charles; Breve, Frank; Christo, Paul",Pain Ther,479,5

Here, we firstly find that the survival outcome of female patients is better to male patients through analyzing the 3044 COVID-19 cases. Secondly, we identify many important master regulators [e.g. STAT1/STAT2 and zinc finger (ZNF) proteins], in particular female patients can express more ZNF proteins and stronger transcriptional activities than male patients in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Thirdly, we discover that ZNF protein activity is significantly negative correlation with the SARS-CoV-2 load of COVID-19 patients, and ZNF proteins as transcription factors can also activate their target genes to participate in anti-SARS-CoV-2 infection. Fourthly, we demonstrate that ZNF protein activity is positive correlation with the abundance of multiple immune cells of COVID-19 patients, implying that the highly ZNF protein activity might promote the abundance and the antiviral activity of multiple immune cells to effectively suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection. Taken together, our study proposes an underlying anti-SARS-COV-2 role of ZNF proteins, and differences in the amount and activity of ZNF proteins might be responsible for the distinct prognosis of different gender COVID-19 patients.","Qin, Shijie; Xu, Weijun; Wang, Canbiao; Jiang, Sizhu; Dai, Wei; Yang, Yang; Shen, Jiawei; Jin, Ping; Ma, Fei; Xia, Xinyi",Brief. bioinform,479,16

At inference, these networks cannot predict an unseen disease class. Incorporating a new class requires the collection of labeled data, which is not a trivial task, especially for less frequently-occurring diseases. As a result, it becomes inconceivable to build a model that can diagnose all possible disease classes. Here, we propose a multi-label generalized zero shot learning (CXR-ML-GZSL) network that can simultaneously predict multiple seen and unseen diseases in CXR images. Given an input image, CXR-ML-GZSL learns a visual representation guided by the input's corresponding semantics extracted from a rich medical text corpus. Towards this ambitious goal, we propose to map both visual and semantic modalities to a latent feature space using a novel learning objective. The objective ensures that (i) the most relevant labels for the query image are ranked higher than irrelevant labels, (ii) the network learns a visual representation that is aligned with its semantics in the latent feature space, and (iii) the mapped semantics preserve their original inter-class representation. The network is end-to-end trainable and requires no independent pre-training for the offline feature extractor. Experiments on the NIH Chest X-ray dataset show that our network outperforms two strong baselines in terms of recall, precision, f1 score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve.

SETTING: An international collaboration of authors and participants. METHODS: Two identical surveys (one in English and one in Spanish) were distributed via the internet. Responses from both surveys were pooled and analyzed for demographic and response data. RESULTS: Three hundred and sixty-six respondents were gathered from multiple continents and regions. The majority (63.1%) were rehabilitation physicians and only 12.1% had patients with spinal cord injury/disease (SCI/D) that they knew had COVID-19. Participants reported that the COVID-19 pandemic had caused limited access to clinician and support services and worsening medical complications. Nearly 40% of inpatient clinicians reported that ""some or all"" of their facilities' beds were being used by medical and surgical patients, rather than by individuals requiring inpatient rehabilitation. Respondents reported a 25.1% increase in use of telemedicine during the pandemic (35% used it before; 60.1% during), though over 60% felt the technology incompletely met their patients' needs. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the ability of individuals with SCI/D to obtain their ""usual level of care."" Moving forward into a potential ""second wave"" of COVID-19, patient advocacy and efforts to secure access to thorough and accessible care are essential.","Gustafson, Kristin; Stillman, Michael; Capron, Maclain; O039,; Connell, Colleen; Longoni Di Giusto, Melina; Tyagi, Nishu; Scivoletto, Giorgio",Spinal Cord Ser Cases,479,14

One of the most difficult challenges that nurses faced in the midst of the crisis was the lack of proper personal protective equipment (PPE). The lack of PPE left health care professionals with a complicated ethical dilemma: Is there an ethical duty to care for patients in the absence of proper PPE? This article seeks to help the individual nurse (a) understand the ethical dilemma and the tensions that it brings, (b) look to the literature for guidance, and (c) understand how individuals can apply these ethical principles. After careful analysis, the recommendation is for the individual nurse to make a thorough assessment of their personal situation. This will include consideration for their family, community, financial responsibilities, legal protections, organizational policies, and personal health risk. Finally, this article serves as a call to organizations and professional leaders to increase their support of frontline health care workers and provide the individual nurse with the information they need in order to make sound decisions.","Rasmussen, Amy; Dambrino, Kathryn",J. hosp. palliat. nurs,479,22

This has led to the development of different surgical techniques to restore knee stability. MATERIAL Y METHODS: Clinical study, randomized, blind comparing ACL reconstruction techniques with One Band and «U-Two¼ using clinical scales and arthrometria with KT-1000 and Pivot Shift Meter. RESULTS: Of 36 patients, 52.94% was drawn for the One Band technique and 47.06% for «U-Two¼. 11.76% of patients had a displacement greater than 11mm in the affected knee with KT-1000. 8.82% showed an equal anterior displacement on both knees. One patient had a major previous displacement after reconstruction surgery with the one band technique, but with improvement on clinical scales. Pivot Shift measurements found a difference in displacement greater than 4,000 m/s on the X axis following the One Band technique compared to the healthy knee calculating integrals, while with U-Two the difference was less than 600 m/s. On the Y axis a difference of 3,500 m/s was found between the healthy and the injured leg, which decreases to less than 2,000 m/s after reconstruction using U-Two technique. CONCLUSIONS: Differences have been found throughout the study in patient evolution, indicating that repair using the U-Dos technique has better results in recovering the anteroposterior and rotational stability of the affected limb.","Berumen-Nafarrate, E; Carmona-González, J; Tonche-Ramos, J J; Carmona-Máynez, O; Aguirre-Madrid, A; Moreno-Brito, V; Leal-Berumen, I",Acta Ortop Mex,479,21

To address this challenge, using computational fluid dynamics, we conducted a systematic investigation of airborne transmission in a classroom equipped with a single horizontal unit ventilator (HUV) and evaluate the performance of a low-cost box fan air cleaner for risk mitigation. Our study shows that placing box fan air cleaners in the classroom results in a substantial reduction of airborne transmission risk across the entire space. The air cleaner can achieve optimal performance when placed near the asymptomatic patient. However, without knowing the location of the patient, the performance of the cleaner is optimal near the HUV with the air flowing downwards. In addition, we find that it is more efficient in reducing aerosol concentration and spread in the classroom by adding air cleaners in comparison with raising the flow rate of HUV alone. The number and placement of air cleaners need to be adjusted to maintain their efficacy for larger classrooms and to account for the thermal gradient associated with a human thermal plume and hot ventilation air during cold seasons. Overall, our study shows that box fan air cleaners can serve as an effective low-cost alternative for mitigating airborne transmission risks in poorly ventilated spaces. © 2021 Author(s).","He, R.; Liu, W.; Elson, J.; Vogt, R.; Maranville, C.; Hong, J.",Physics of Fluids,479,30

Early in the pandemic, contact tracing apps generated significant enthusiasm due to their potential for automating tracing and reducing transmission rates, while enabling targeted confinement strategies. However, while surveys demonstrate public interest in using such apps, their actual uptake remains limited. Their social acceptability is challenged by issues around privacy, fairness, and effectiveness, among other concerns. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to (1) examine the extent to which design and implementation considerations for contact tracing apps are detailed in the available literature, focusing on aspects related to participatory and responsible eHealth innovation, and (2) synthesize recommendations that support the development of successful COVID-19 contact tracing apps and related eHealth technologies. METHODS: Searches were performed on five databases and articles were selected based on eligibility criteria. Papers pertaining to the design, implementation and/or acceptability of contact tracing apps were included. Articles published since 2019, written in English or French and for which the full articles were available were considered eligible for analysis. To assess the scope of the knowledge found in the current literature, we used three complementary frameworks: (1) the Holistic Framework to Improve the Uptake and Impact of eHealth Technologies, (2) the Montreal Model and (3) the Responsible Innovation in Health (RIH) Assessment Tool. RESULTS: A total of 63 articles qualified for the final analysis. Less than half of the selected articles cited the need for a participatory process (40%), which nonetheless was the most frequently referenced item of the Framework to Improve the Uptake and Impact of eHealth Technologies. In regard to the Montreal Model, stakeholder consultation was the most frequently described level of engagement in the development of contact tracing apps (38%), while collaboration and partnership were cited the least (3%). As for the RIH framework, all the articles (100%) addressed population health, whereas only 2% covered environmental considerations. CONCLUSIONS: Most studies lacked fundamental aspects of eHealth development and implementation. Our results demonstrate that stakeholders of COVID-19 contact tracing apps lack important information to be able to critically appraise this eHealth innovation. This may have contributed to the modest uptake of contact tracing apps worldwide. We make evidence-informed recommendations regarding data management, communication, stakeholder engagement, user experience and implementation strategies for the successful and responsible development of contact tracing apps.","Osmanlliu, Esli; Rafie, Edmond; Bédard, Sylvain; Paquette, Jesseca; Gore, Genevieve; Pomey, Marie-Pascale",,479,6

METHODS: Students (aged 11-14; grades 7-8) who received a 3-month teacher-delivered intervention embedded in the language arts curriculum (N=200) were compared to a wait-list control group (N=230) in the largest urban school board in Canada. Suicidality defined as a composite measure of self-reported suicidal ideation and attempts [primary outcome], self-reported emotion dysregulation, interpersonal chaos, confusion about self, and impulsivity [Life Problems Inventory (LPI)] and self-reported depression and anxiety symptoms [Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale (RCADS)] were the outcomes of interest. Measurements occurred prior to and after curriculum delivery with independent t-tests used to compare mean change scores between groups clustered by class. RESULTS: Thirty-seven English teachers in 46 classes across 15 schools comprised the planned study cohort. Composite suicidality scores were significantly worse in the control than intervention group at endpoint (0.05±0.54 vs. 0.17±0.47, t= -2.60, df=428, p=0.01). There were also significant improvements in LPI and RCADS scores in the intervention group compared to controls (LPI:-3.74±7.98 vs. 1.16±10.77 t=5.28, df=428, p<.001; RCADS: (-3.08±5.49 vs. -1.51±6.53 t=2.96, df=429, p=0.01). Sub-analyses revealed that these improvements were largely driven by a significant difference in scores in girls.

All-cause death was the outcome end-point. RESULTS: 1075 patients were lean (BMI 18.5-24.9 kg/m2), 1523 overweight (BMI 25.0-29.9 kg/m2), and 651 obese (&#8805;30.0 kg/m2). Ischemic test result for RWMA occurred in 28 (3%) lean, 69 (4%) overweight, and 28 (4%) obese patients (p = 0.03). An abnormal CFVR (&#8804;2.0) was found in 281 (26%) lean, 402 (26%) overweight and 170 (26%) obese patients (p = 0.99). During 68 ± 44 months of follow-up, 496 (15%) patients died. At multivariable Cox analysis, BMI &#8805; 30 was an independent predictor of reduced mortality in the 878 patients with stress-induced (&#8805;2 segments) RWMA and/or CFVR abnormality (HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.40-0.84; p = 0.003), while showed no effect at univariate analysis in the 2371 patients with no RWMA and normal CFVR (HR 1.04, 95% CI 0.74-1.46; p = 0.84). CONCLUSIONS: Obesity exerts a ""paradoxical"" protective effect in patients with stress-induced ischemia and/ or coronary microvascular dysfunction, and shows a neutral effect in patients with normal CFVR and no stress-induced RWMA.","Cortigiani, Lauro; Haberka, Maciej; Ciampi, Quirino; Bovenzi, Francesco; Villari, Bruno; Picano, Eugenio",,479,20

The aim was to assess the association between physical activity and self-reported CR fitness on COVID-19 infection characteristics. METHODS: Participants formerly testing positive for COVID-19 completed an online questionnaire measuring COVID-19 infection characteristics and complications, self-reported CR fitness level, physical activity, and sociodemographic and health-related characteristics. Self-reported CR fitness was determined as the pace to cover 4.8 km without becoming overly fatigued (with slow walking, brisk walking, jogging, and running corresponding to low, moderate, good, and excellent levels of fitness, respectively). RESULTS: A total of 263 individuals completed the survey. Compared with the lowest level of self-reported CR fitness, the odds of hospitalization significantly decreased by 64% (odds ratio = 0.36; 95% confidence interval, 0.13-0.98; P = .04) in individuals reporting the ability to maintain a brisk walk. In individuals reporting the ability to maintain a jogging pace, the further reduction in hospitalization was not significant (odds ratio = 0.22; 95% confidence interval, 0.05-1.04; P = .05). For COVID-19 symptom severity and number, there were no significant associations with self-reported CR fitness or physical activity levels. CONCLUSIONS: For individuals with low self-reported CR fitness, improving CR fitness represents a strategy to reduce the risk of hospitalization from COVID-19.","Brandenburg, Jason P; Lesser, Iris A; Thomson, Cynthia J; Giles, Luisa V",J Phys Act Health,479,16

COVID-19 is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. The mode of transmission of COVID-19 is a subject of intense research. The airborne transmission is one prime possibility. Breathing and talking are natural processes which generate exhaled particles. The exhaled air is an aerosol/droplet composed of naturally produced particulates of varying size. The duration over which the aerosols/droplets are suspended in the air is an important factor. Long suspended aerosols/droplets are potential source of transmission, particularly in confined spaces. We have calculated times of suspension by considering various environmental factors, namely, the ambient temperature and relative humidity in a confined space, in this work. Both temperature and relative humidity affect the suspension time of the exhaled aerosols/droplets with varying degree. The effects of environmental factors are significant for aerosols, particularly for those with small radii. We have discussed the possible implications of our findings in this paper.

To better understand the state of RBM implementation across the clinical trial industry, the Association of Clinical Research Organizations (ACRO) conducted a landscape survey among its member companies across 6,513 clinical trials ongoing at the end of 2019. Of these trials, 22% included at least 1 of the 5 RBM components: key risk indicators (KRIs), centralized monitoring, off-site/remote-site monitoring, reduced source data verification (SDV), and reduced source document review (SDR). The implementation rates for the individual RBM components ranged 8%-19%, with the most frequently implemented component being centralized monitoring and the least frequently implemented being reduced SDR. When the COVID-19 pandemic emerged in early 2020, additional data were collected to assess its impact on trial monitoring, focusing specifically on trials switching from on-site monitoring to off-site/remote-site monitoring. These mid-pandemic data show that the vast majority of monitoring visits were on-site in February 2020, but an even higher percentage were off-site in April, corresponding with the first peak of the pandemic. Despite this shift, similar numbers of non-COVID-related protocol deviations were detected from February through June, suggesting little or no reduction in monitoring effectiveness. The pre- and mid-pandemic data provide two very different snapshots of RBM implementation, but both support the need to promote adoption of this approach while also highlighting an opportunity to capitalize on the recent shift toward greater RBM uptake in a post-pandemic environment.","Barnes, Brian; Stansbury, Nicole; Brown, Debby; Garson, Lauren; Gerard, Geoff; Piccoli, Nickolas; Jendrasek, Debra; May, Nick; Castillo, Vanesa; Adelfio, Anina; Ramirez, Nycole; McSweeney, Andrea; Berlien, Ruth; Butler, Paula Jo",Ther Innov Regul Sci,479,26

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 225 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 who were admitted to the North Hospital of First Hospital in Changsha, China, from 9th February 2020 to 7th March 2020 were enrolled. Their general data, laboratory test results and levels of SAA, CRP and FERR were extracted from electronic medical records. RESULTS: Age was an important risk factor for the severity of COVID-19 in the patients. Compared with the non-severe group, the severe group showed statistical significance in the levels of total protein, albumin, ALT and AST in liver function, UA in renal function, myocardial enzyme CK-MB and LDH, and immunoglobulin IgG and IgM. The levels of SAA, CRP, and FERR were significantly increased in patients with severe COVID-19. ROC curve analysis results showed that the AUC, from small to large, was as follows: SAA+CRP+FERR, CRP + FERR, SAA + CRP, SAA + FERR, SAA, FERR, and CRP, which indicated the benefit of the combination of the three indicators. The sensitivity and specificity of the combined detection of the three indicators were higher than those of the detection of any single indicator or two combined indicators. A Spearman correlation analysis of the data showed that the initial CRP/SAA, SAA/FERR, and CRP/FERR were positively correlated. The continuous results of SAA, CRP and FERR throughout the study period showed that the values of the severe group on a given day were higher than those of the non-severe group; the values of the two groups peaked on the 5th or 7th day and then decreased, and the decreasing trend of the severe group was more evident. CONCLUSIONS: SAA, CRP and FERR are sensitive serological indicators used to evaluate the severity of COVID-19. The combined detection of serum SAA, FERR, and CRP, which are positively related to COVID-19 infection, offers guiding significance for the occurrence of COVID-19 infection and the severity of the disease. Such detection provides effective detection indicators for the progress and prognosis of COVID-19; these indicators will enable effective intervention measures to be implemented in time and the rates of severe illness and mortality to be reduced.","Liu, S-L; Wang, S-Y; Sun, Y-F; Jia, Q-Y; Yang, C-L; Cai, P-J; Li, J-Y; Wang, L; Chen, Y",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,479,1

In the United States (US), state governments have implemented various non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), such as physical distance closure (lockdown), stay-at-home order, mandatory facial mask in public in response to the rapid spread of COVID-19. To evaluate the effectiveness of these NPIs, we propose a nested case-control design with propensity score weighting under the quasi-experiment framework to estimate the average intervention effect on disease transmission across states. We further develop a method to test for factors that moderate intervention effect to assist precision public health intervention. Our method takes account of the underlying dynamics of disease transmission and balance state-level pre-intervention characteristics. We prove that our estimator provides causal intervention effect under assumptions. We apply this method to analyze US COVID-19 incidence cases to estimate the effects of six interventions. We show that lockdown has the largest effect on reducing transmission and reopening bars significantly increase transmission. States with a higher percentage of non-white population are at greater risk of increased $R_t$ associated with reopening bars.","Xie, Shanghong; Wang, Wenbo; Wang, Qinxia; Wang, Yuanjia; Zeng, Donglin",,479,26

The method is applicable to a class of discretetime, finite-population compartmental models with partial, randomly under-reported or missing count observations. In contrast to state-of-the-art alternatives such as Approximate Bayesian Computation techniques, no forward simulation of the model is required and there are no tuning parameters. Evaluating the approximate marginal likelihood of model parameters is achieved through a computationally simple filtering recursion. The accuracy of the approximation is demonstrated through analysis of real and simulated data using a model of the 1995 Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo. We show how the method can be embedded within a Sequential Monte Carlo approach to estimating the time-varying reproduction number of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, recently published by Kucharski et al.

Data are needed regarding the clinical course of hospitalised patients, particularly in the USA. We aimed to compare clinical characteristic of patients with COVID-19 who had in-hospital mortality with those who were discharged alive. DESIGN: Demographic, clinical and outcomes data for patients admitted to five Mount Sinai Health System hospitals with confirmed COVID-19 between 27 February and 2 April 2020 were identified through institutional electronic health records. We performed a retrospective comparative analysis of patients who had in-hospital mortality or were discharged alive. SETTING: All patients were admitted to the Mount Sinai Health System, a large quaternary care urban hospital system. PARTICIPANTS: Participants over the age of 18 years were included. PRIMARY OUTCOMES: We investigated in-hospital mortality during the study period. RESULTS: A total of 2199 patients with COVID-19 were hospitalised during the study period. As of 2 April, 1121 (51%) patients remained hospitalised, and 1078 (49%) completed their hospital course. Of the latter, the overall mortality was 29%, and 36% required intensive care. The median age was 65 years overall and 75 years in those who died. Pre-existing conditions were present in 65% of those who died and 46% of those discharged. In those who died, the admission median lymphocyte percentage was 11.7%, D-dimer was 2.4 µg/mL, C reactive protein was 162 mg/L and procalcitonin was 0.44 ng/mL. In those discharged, the admission median lymphocyte percentage was 16.6%, D-dimer was 0.93 µg/mL, C reactive protein was 79 mg/L and procalcitonin was 0.09 ng/mL. CONCLUSIONS: In our cohort of hospitalised patients, requirement of intensive care and mortality were high. Patients who died typically had more pre-existing conditions and greater perturbations in inflammatory markers as compared with those who were discharged.","Paranjpe, Ishan; Russak, Adam J; De Freitas, Jessica K; Lala, Anuradha; Miotto, Riccardo; Vaid, Akhil; Johnson, Kipp W; Danieletto, Matteo; Golden, Eddye; Meyer, Dara; Singh, Manbir; Somani, Sulaiman; Kapoor, Arjun; O039,; Hagan, Ross; Manna, Sayan; Nangia, Udit; Jaladanki, Suraj K; Reilly, Paul; Huckins, Laura M; Glowe, Patricia; Kia, Arash; Timsina, Prem; Freeman, Robert M; Levin, Matthew A; Jhang, Jeffrey; Firpo, Adolfo; Kovatch, Patricia; Finkelstein, Joseph; Aberg, Judith A; Bagiella, Emilia; Horowitz, Carol R; Murphy, Barbara; Fayad, Zahi A; Narula, Jagat; Nestler, Eric J; Fuster, V; Cordon-Cardo, Carlos; Charney, Dennis; Reich, David L; Just, Allan; Bottinger, Erwin P; Charney, Alexander W; Glicksberg, Benjamin S; Nadkarni, Girish N",BMJ Open,479,9

Delirium is frequent in SARS-COV2 patients and it is associated with increased mortality; however, no information is available on the association between delirium duration in SARS-COV2 patients and related outcomes. AIMS: The aim of this study is to investigate the association between the duration of delirium symptoms and in-hospital mortality in older patients with SARS-COV2 infection. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of patients 65 years of age and older with SARS-CoV 2 infection admitted to two acute geriatric wards and one rehabilitation ward. Delirium symptoms duration was assessed retrospectively with a chart-based validated method. In-hospital mortality was ascertained via medical records. RESULTS: A total of 241 patients were included. The prevalence of delirium on admission was 16%. The median number of days with delirium symptoms was 4 (IQR 2-6.5) vs. 0 (IQR 0-2) in patients with and without delirium on admission. In the multivariable Cox regression model, each day with a delirium symptom in a patient with the same length of stay was associated with a 10% increase in in-hospital mortality (Hazard ratio 1.1, 95% Confidence interval 1.01-1.2; p = 0.03). Other variables associated with increased risk of in-hospital death were age, comorbidity, CPAP, CRP levels and total number of drugs on admission. CONCLUSIONS: The study supports the necessity to establish protocols for the monitoring and management of delirium during emergency conditions to allow an appropriate care for older patients.","Morandi, Alessandro; Rebora, Paola; Isaia, Gianluca; Grossi, Eleonora; Faraci, Bianca; Gentile, Simona; Bo, Mario; Valsecchi, Maria Grazia; Deiana, Valentina; Ghezzi, Nives; Miksza, Julia; Blangiardo, Paolo; Bellelli, Giuseppe",Aging Clin Exp Res,479,9

To gauge the potential for widespread contagion, to cope with associated uncertainty and to inform its mitigation, more accurate and robust modelling is centrally important for policy making. We provide a flexible modelling approach that increases the accuracy with which insights can be made. We use this to analyse different scenarios relevant to the COVID-19 situation in the UK. We present a stochastic model that captures the inherently probabilistic nature of contagion between population members. The computational nature of our model means that spatial constraints (e.g., communities and regions), the susceptibility of different age groups and other factors such as medical pre-histories can be incorporated with ease. We analyse different possible scenarios of the COVID-19 situation in the UK. Our model is robust to small changes in the parameters and is flexible in being able to deal with different scenarios. This approach goes beyond the convention of representing the spread of an epidemic through a fixed cycle of susceptibility, infection and recovery (SIR). It is important to emphasise that standard SIR-type models, unlike our model, are not flexible enough and are also not stochastic and hence should be used with extreme caution. Our model allows both heterogeneity and inherent uncertainty to be incorporated. Due to the scarcity of verified data, we draw insights by calibrating our model using parameters from other relevant sources, including agreement on average (mean field) with parameters in SIR-based models.","Zhigljavsky, Anatoly; Whitaker, Roger; Fesenko, Ivan; Kremnizer, Kobi; Noonan, Jack; Harper, Paul; Gillard, Jonathan; Woolley, Thomas; Gartner, Daniel; Grimsley, Jasmine; Arruda, Edilson de; Fedorov, Val; MBE, Tom Crick",,479,26

Alcohol now also poses specific concerns, such as increased risk of severe lung infections, domestic violence, child abuse, depression and suicide. Its use is unlikely to aid physical distancing or other preventative behavioural measures. Globally, alcohol contributes to 20% of injury and 11.5% of non-injury emergency room presentations. We provide some broad comparisons between alcohol-attributable and COVID-19-related hospitalisations and deaths in North America using most recent data. For example, for Canada in 2017 it was recently estimated there were 105 065 alcohol-attributable hospitalisations which represent a substantially higher rate over time than the 10 521 COVID-19 hospitalisations reported during the first 5 months of the pandemic. Despite the current importance of protecting health-care services, most governments have deemed alcohol sales to be as essential as food, fuel and pharmaceuticals. In many countries, alcohol is now more readily available and affordable than ever before, a situation global alcohol producers benefit from and have helped engineer. We argue that to protect frontline health-care services and public health more generally, it is essential that modest, evidence-based restrictions on alcohol prices, availability and marketing are introduced. In particular, we recommend increases in excise taxation coupled with minimum unit pricing to both reduce impacts on health-care services and provide much-needed revenues for governments at this critical time.","Stockwell, Tim; Andreasson, Sven; Cherpitel, Cheryl; Chikritzhs, Tanya; Dangardt, Frida; Holder, Harold; Naimi, Timothy; Sherk, Adam",Drug alcohol rev,479,29

They are known to fundamentally change the electronic states of the layers, but similar effects on their mechanical and vibrational properties have not been discussed so far. Here we show that the moiré potential shifts the radial breathing mode in double-walled carbon nanotubes (DWCNTs). The change in frequency is expected to be proportional to the shift in optical transition energies, which are induced by the moiré patterns. To verify our model, we performed resonance Raman scattering on purified and sorted semiconducting DWCNTs. We find that the radial breathing mode shifts up to 14 cm-1 higher in energy followed by displacement of optical transition energies of up to 200 meV to lower energies, in comparison to the single-walled tubes. We show how to identify the strong coupling condition in DWCNTs from their phonon frequencies and construct a Kataura plot to aid their future experimental assignment.","Gordeev, Georgy; Wasserroth, Sören; Li, Han; Flavel, Benjamin; Reich, Stephanie",Nano lett,479,24

Plans are now being formulated for restarting bariatric surgery. The aim of this survey is to capture the practice during the pandemic and the readiness to restart to provide a framework to deal with the backlog of bariatric cases. METHOD: A survey was delivered to consultant surgeon members of the British Obesity and Metabolic Surgery Society and non-bariatric surgery consultant members of the Association of Upper GI Surgeons. RESULTS: The survey elicited a response rate of 40% (n = 66) among bariatric surgeons and 15.5% (n = 34) between non-bariatric surgeons. The average question response rate was 93% (88-100%). Most of the elective bariatric surgeries and clinics were cancelled early after declaration of the pandemic. Remote technologies for patient education evolved and were used heavily during the pandemic. The average cancelled elective bariatric surgery operations per week was 9. Nearly a quarter of responders reported performing emergency bariatric surgery during the pandemic. Most of the bariatric surgeons reported being ready to restart the service within 1-2 months. Responders recommended using private sector beds to increase NHS capacity and using the link between obesity and poor COVID-19 outcomes to push for prioritisation of bariatric patients. CONCLUSION: This survey is an attempt to understand the impact of COVID-19 on UK bariatric service and the preparedness to restart. It expressed the bariatric surgery consultants' view of prioritisation of bariatric patients on clinical basis rather than the first-come-first-served basis.","Ghanem, Ahmed; Emile, Sameh; Cousins, Jonathan; Kerrigan, David; Ahmed, Ahmed Rashid",Surg. endosc,479,13

To reduce screen-time for patients, the nonverbal therapies were shortened. Four patients, aged 64-70 years, started our online program. RESULTS: Therapists were positive about the online capabilities and resilience of patients to adapt to the new situation. Prejudices on limited effectiveness of online psychotherapy were counteracted. Sending homework by email and mail seems to facilitate therapy adherence.

This case series study was conducted to determine the incidence rate and the course of Covid-19 infection in MS/NMOSD patients treated with Rituximab. METHODS: In this study, we designed a web-based questionnaire. Baseline information such as patient- reported walking disability, total number of Rituximab infusions received, delayed injections, occurrence of any relapse, and the use of corticosteroids during the pandemic were collected. Also, information regarding the Covid-19 pandemic such as adherence to self-isolation, any recent exposure to an infected individual and the presence of suggestive symptoms were collected. In case of positive test results, patients were grouped into 2 categories; mild to moderate and seriously ill and outcomes were evaluated as favorable (improved/ discharged) and unfavorable (expired). RESULTS: Two hundred fifty-eight patients with Multiple Sclerosis were enrolled in this study, 9 of the subjects (3.4%) were confirmed positive for Covid-19, five of which required hospitalizations (55.5%), two patients required ICU admission (22.2%) and 2 two patients died (22.2%). None of these patients ever mentioned using corticosteroids during the pandemic. In comparison to MS patients who were not receiving disease modifying therapy (DMT), our study indicated a higher incidence of Covid-19 infection, higher ratio of serious illness and a higher fatality ratio. CONCLUSIONS: Rituximab seems not to be safe enough during the pandemic.","Esmaeili, Sara; Abbasi, Mohammad Hossein; Abolmaali, Meysam; Mojtahed, Mohammad; Alavi, Seyedeh Niloufar Rafiei; Soleimani, Sevim; Mokhtari, Mahisa; Hatam, Jaber; Khotbehsara, Samaneh Tanhapour; Motamed, Mohammad Reza; Joghataei, Mohammad Taghi; Mirzaasgari, Zahra; Moghaddasi, Mehdi",BMC Neurol,479,20

Knowing the intended uptake of the vaccine will inform supply and public health messaging to maximize vaccination. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to measure the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the acceptance of influenza vaccination in the 2020-2021 season, specifically focusing on people who were previously eligible but routinely declined vaccination and newly eligible people. METHODS: Intention to receive the influenza vaccine in 2020-2021 was asked of all registrants of the largest electronic personal health record in the NHS by a web-based questionnaire on July 31, 2020. Of those who were either newly or previously eligible but had not previously received an influenza vaccination, multivariable logistic regression and network diagrams were used to examine their reasons to undergo or decline vaccination. RESULTS: Among 6641 respondents, 945 (14.2%) were previously eligible but were not vaccinated; of these, 536 (56.7%) intended to receive an influenza vaccination in 2020-2021, as did 466 (68.6%) of the newly eligible respondents. Intention to receive the influenza vaccine was associated with increased age, index of multiple deprivation quintile, and considering oneself to be at high risk from COVID-19. Among those who were eligible but not intending to be vaccinated in 2020-2021, 164/543 (30.2%) gave reasons based on misinformation. Of the previously unvaccinated health care workers, 47/96 (49%) stated they would decline vaccination in 2020-2021. CONCLUSIONS: In this sample, COVID-19 has increased acceptance of influenza vaccination in previously eligible but unvaccinated people and has motivated substantial uptake in newly eligible people. This study is essential for informing resource planning and the need for effective messaging campaigns to address negative misconceptions, which is also necessary for COVID-19 vaccination programs.","Bachtiger, Patrik; Adamson, Alexander; Chow, Ji-Jian; Sisodia, Rupa; Quint, Jennifer K; Peters, Nicholas S",JMIR Public Health Surveill,479,24

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a relatively common condition affecting young females that could lead to permanent blindness if not properly treated. In this article, we provide some insight and recommendations regarding the management of IIH during the pandemic. METHODS: The diagnosis, follow-up, and treatment methods of IIH during the COVID-19 pandemic period are reviewed. COVID-19 as a mimic of IIH is also discussed. RESULTS: Diagnosis and follow-up of papilledema due to IIH during the COVID-19 pandemic can be facilitated by nonmydriatic fundus photography and optical coherence tomography. COVID-19 may mimic IIH by presenting as cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, papillophlebitis, or meningoencephalitis, so a high index of suspicious is required in these cases. When surgical treatment is indicated, optic nerve sheath fenestration may be the primary procedure of choice during the pandemic period. CONCLUSION: IIH is a serious vision threatening condition that could lead to permanent blindness and disability at a relatively young age if left untreated. It could be the first presentation of a COVID-19 infection. Certain precautions during the diagnosis and management of this condition could be taken that may allow appropriate care to be delivered to these patients while minimizing the risk of coronavirus infection.","Elnahry, Ayman G; Elnahry, Gehad A",Reviews on recent clinical trials (Online),479,24

The requirement of patients on dialysis for regular treatment in settings typically not conducive to social distancing may increase their vulnerability to COVID-19. METHODS: Over a 6-week period, we recorded new COVID-19 infections and outcomes for all adult patients receiving dialysis in a large dialysis center. Rapidly introduced control measures included a two-stage routine screening process at dialysis entry (temperature and symptom check, with possible cases segregated within the unit and tested for SARS-CoV-2), isolated dialysis in a separate unit for patients with infection, and universal precautions that included masks for dialysis nursing staff. RESULTS: Of 1530 patients (median age 66 years; 58.2% men) receiving dialysis, 300 (19.6%) developed COVID-19 infection, creating a large demand for isolated outpatient dialysis and inpatient beds. An analysis that included 1219 patients attending satellite dialysis clinics found that older age was a risk factor for infection.

Hence, this paper proposes weight vector tuning of a generic binary linear classifier through the parameterization of a decomposition of the discriminant by a scalar which controls the trade-off between conflicting informative and noisy terms. By varying this parameter, the original weight vector is modified in a meaningful way. Applying this method to a number of linear classifiers under a variety of data dimensionality and sample size settings reveals that the classification performance loss due to non-optimal native hyperparameters can be compensated for by weight vector tuning. This yields computational savings as the proposed tuning method reduces to tuning a scalar compared to tuning the native hyperparameter, which may involve repeated weight vector generation along with its burden of optimization, dimensionality reduction, etc., depending on the classifier. It is also found that weight vector tuning significantly improves the performance of Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) under high estimation noise. Proceeding from this second finding, an asymptotic study of the misclassification probability of the parameterized LDA classifier in the growth regime where the data dimensionality and sample size are comparable is conducted. Using random matrix theory, the misclassification probability is shown to converge to a quantity that is a function of the true statistics of the data. Additionally, an estimator of the misclassification probability is derived. Finally, computationally efficient tuning of the parameter using this estimator is demonstrated on real data.","Niyazi, Lama B.; Kammoun, Abla; Dahrouj, Hayssam; Alouini, Mohamed-Slim; Al-Naffouri, Tareq",,479,16

Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of these factors on fresh sperm motility in piracanjuba ( Brycon orbignyanus ) and streaked prochilod ( Prochilodus lineatus ). Twenty four media, as a combination of six extenders (BTS and glucose solutions at 270, 315 and 360 mOsm/kg) with the CPAs DMSO, methanol, methyl glycol (MG) and a control without CPA, were prepared. Immediately after dilution, samples were observed under a light microscope to confirm whether different extender-CPA combinations would suppress the initiation of sperm motility. Motility was then triggered in 92 mOsm/kg NaCl and evaluated immediately after dilution (non-equilibrated samples) and after a 30-min equilibration time at 4°C for motility rate and motility quality score (0 = no movement; 5 = rapidly swimming sperm). In both species, motility was initiated in all samples diluted in BTS-270-control, Glu-270-MG, Glu- 270-control and in all combinations containing DMSO. In B. orbignyanus , motility rate (77 to 92%) and motility quality score (3.3 to 4.7) of non-equilitrated samples was not significantly affected by any parameter.

The study design includes three districts, enabling comparison between diverse agro-ecological zones and geographical contexts. The methodology consists of primary data collection, modelling and quantitative analysis. The analysis is based on actual school meal food baskets which represent culturally and nutritionally optimised food baskets, developed by the local community and notional typical household food baskets. End May/early June 2020 is the 'Post-COVID-19' reference point, the same time period in 2019 i.e. June 2019 is the 'Pre-COVID-19' reference point. The study finds a substantial increase in food commodity prices across food groups and districts with marked inter-district variation. For school meal basket, all micronutrients show large average declines ranging from 9â 5 % for zinc to 11 % for vitamin-A. For household food baskets on average, vitamin-A reduced 37 % followed by iron at 19 %, reduction in zinc is low due to the high zinc content in whole grain cereals.

The COVID-19 triggers a lung infection with a multiple proinflammatory cytokine storm in severe patients. Without effective and safe treatments, COVID-19 has killed thousands of people, becoming a pandemic. Stem cells have been suggested as a therapy for lung-related diseases. In particular, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been successfully tested in some clinical trials in patients with COVID-19. The encouraging results positioned MSCs as a possible cell therapy for COVID-19. The amniotic membrane from the human placenta at term is a valuable stem cell source, including human amniotic epithelial cells (hAECs) and human mesenchymal stromal cells (hAMSCs). Interestingly, amnion cells have immunoregulatory, regenerative, and anti-inflammatory properties. Moreover, hAECs and hAMSCs have been used both in preclinical studies and in clinical trials against respiratory diseases. They have reduced the inflammatory response and restored the pulmonary tissue architecture in lung injury in vivo models. Here, we review the existing data about the stem cells use for COVID-19 treatment, including the ongoing clinical trials. We also consider the non-cellular therapies that are being applied. Finally, we discuss the human amniotic membrane cells use in patients who suffer from immune/inflammatory lung diseases and hypothesize their possible use as a successful treatment against COVID-19.","Riedel, Rodrigo N; Pérez-Pérez, Antonio; Sánchez-Margalet, Víctor; Varone, Cecilia L; Maymó, Julieta L",Stem Cell Res Ther,479,1

OBJECTIVES: We sought to rapidly investigate the clinical characteristics, population structure and mechanisms of resistance of CPE causing secondary infections in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We retrospectively identified CPE clinical isolates collected from patients testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 between March and April 2020 at our medical centre in New York City. Available isolates underwent nanopore sequencing for rapid genotyping, antibiotic resistance gene detection and phylogenetic analysis. RESULTS: We identified 31 CPE isolates from 13 patients, including 27 Klebsiella pneumoniae and 4 Enterobacter cloacae complex isolates. Most patients (11/13) had a positive respiratory culture and 7/13 developed bacteraemia; treatment failure was common. Twenty isolates were available for WGS. Most K. pneumoniae (16/17) belonged to ST258 and encoded KPC (15 KPC-2; 1 KPC-3); one ST70 isolate encoded KPC-2. E. cloacae isolates belonged to ST270 and encoded NDM-1. Nanopore sequencing enabled identification of at least four distinct ST258 lineages in COVID-19 patients, which were validated by Illumina sequencing data. CONCLUSIONS: While CPE prevalence has declined substantially in New York City in recent years, increased detection in patients with COVID-19 may signal a re-emergence of these highly resistant pathogens in the wake of the global pandemic. Increased surveillance and antimicrobial stewardship efforts, as well as identification of optimal treatment approaches for CPE, will be needed to mitigate their future impact.","Gomez-Simmonds, Angela; Annavajhala, Medini K; McConville, Thomas H; Dietz, Donald E; Shoucri, Sherif M; Laracy, Justin C; Rozenberg, Felix D; Nelson, Brian; Greendyke, William G; Furuya, E Yoko; Whittier, Susan; Uhlemann, Anne-Catrin",J. antimicrob. chemother,479,17

SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binds with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a key protein for the viral entry into the host cells. Here, we report an efficient computational approach, including the simple energy minimizations and binding free energy calculations, starting from an experimental structure of the binding complex along with experimental calibration of the calculated binding free energies, to rapidly and reliably predict the binding affinities of the N501Y mutant with human ACE2 (hACE2) and recently reported miniprotein and hACE2 decoy (CTC-445.2) drug candidates. It has been demonstrated that the N501Y mutation markedly increases the ACE2-spike protein binding affinity (Kd) from 22 to 0.44 nM, which could partially explain why the UK variant is more infectious. The miniproteins are predicted to have â¼10,000- to 100,000-fold diminished binding affinities with the N501Y mutant, creating a need for design of novel therapeutic candidates to overcome the N501Y mutation-induced drug resistance. The N501Y mutation is also predicted to decrease the binding affinity of a hACE2 decoy (CTC-445.2) binding with the spike protein by â¼200-fold. This convenient computational approach along with experimental calibration may be similarly used in the future to predict the binding affinities of potential new variants of the spike protein.","Williams, Alexander H; Zhan, Chang-Guo",J Phys Chem B,479,29

Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have become crucial for reducing morbidity and mortality. In this study, in vitro and in vivo safety and efficacy analyzes of lyophilized vaccine candidates inactivated by gamma-irradiation were performed. The candidate vaccines in this study were OZG-3861 version 1 (V1), an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus vaccine, and SK-01 version 1 (V1), a GM-CSF adjuvant added vaccine. The candidate vaccines were applied intradermally to BALB/c mice to assess toxicity and immunogenicity. Preliminary results in vaccinated mice are reported in this study. Especially, the vaccine models containing GM-CSF caused significant antibody production with neutralization capacity in absence of the antibody-dependent enhancement feature, when considered in terms of T and B cell responses. Another important finding was that the presence of adjuvant was more important in T cell in comparison with B cell response. Vaccinated mice showed T cell response upon restimulation with whole inactivated SARS-CoV-2 or peptide pool. This study shows that the vaccines are effective and leads us to start the challenge test to investigate the gamma-irradiated inactivated vaccine candidates for infective SARS-CoV-2 virus in humanized ACE2 + mice.","Sir Karakus, Gozde; Tastan, Cihan; Dilek Kancagi, Derya; Yurtsever, Bulut; Tumentemur, Gamze; Demir, Sevda; Turan, Raife Dilek; Abanuz, Selen; Cakirsoy, Didem; Seyis, Utku; Ozer, Samed; Elibol, Omer; Elek, Muhammer; Ertop, Gurcan; Arbak, Serap; Acikel Elmas, Merve; Hemsinlioglu, Cansu; Kocagoz, Ayse Sesin; Hatirnaz Ng, Ozden; Akyoney, Sezer; Sahin, Ilayda; Ozbek, Ugur; Telci, Dilek; Sahin, Fikrettin; Yalcin, Koray; Ratip, Siret; Ovali, Ercument",Sci Rep,479,26

Such restrictions on mobility interrupted the normal functioning of agricultural value chains. For a sample of 1767 tomato and wheat producers in the state of Haryana, we study to what extent the lockdown limited access to inputs, labor, machinery, and markets to produce, harvest, and sell their crops. We quantify crop income reductions during the first months of the lockdown and analyze to what extent these are associated with borrowing and food insecurity. We find that wheat producers, for whom state-led procurement guaranteed market access at fixed prices, suffered minimal declines in income. For tomato producers?an already more vulnerable population?income fell by 50% relative to their expected income in a normal year, largely due to a steep fall of tomato prices as they shifted from wholesale markets to local retail markets, resulting in a sharp increase in local supply. Relative to wheat producers affected by the lockdown, reduced income for tomato producers was associated with an increase in borrowing and reduced food security. We conclude that targeting producers of crops that face substantial price risk and introducing policies that stabilize market prices are important in efforts to aid recovery and build resilience of smallholder farmers.","Ceballos, Francisco Kannan Samyuktha Kramer Berber",Agricultural Economics,479,15

EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Evidence from previous reports from SARS and MERS, and from COVID-19 cases were reviewed. Concepts from guidelines from the government and academic societies were collected as well. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: The evidences were described and summarized. CONCLUSIONS: Principles to minimize the risk of infection as well as optimize patients' safety during obstetric anesthesia were found to include careful evaluation, tight protection, and multi-discipline-based strategy. Though vertical transmission of COVID-19 still needs more definitive evidences, strict isolation is necessary for the newborn of COVID-19 mothers.

We sought to determine the pandemic's impact on CTS trainees' educational experiences. METHODS: A survey was developed and distributed to members of the Thoracic Surgery Residents Association and other international CTS trainees. Trainees were asked to evaluate their cumulative experiences and share their overall perceptions of how CTS training had been impacted during the earliest months of the COVID-19 pandemic (i.e., since March 01, 2020). Surveys were distributed and responses were recorded June 25-August 05, 2020. In total, 748 surveys were distributed and 166 responses were received (overall response rate 22.2%). Of these, 126 of 166 responses (75.9%) met inclusion criteria for final analysis. RESULTS: Final responses analyzed included 45 of 126 (35.7%) United States (US) and 81 of 126 (64.3%) international trainees, including 101 of 126 (80.2%) senior and 25 of 126 (19.8%) junior trainees. Most respondents (76/126, 43.2%) lost over 1 week in the hospital due to the pandemic. Juniors (12/25, 48.0%) were more likely than seniors (20/101, 19.8%) to be reassigned to COVID-19-specific units (p < .01). Half of trainees (63/126) reported their case volumes were reduced by over 50%. US trainees (42/45, 93.3%) were more likely than international trainees (58/81, 71.6%) to report reduced operative case volumes (p < .01). Most trainees (104/126, 83%) believed their overall clinical acumen was not adversely impacted by the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: CTS trainees in the United States and abroad have been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, with time lost in the hospital, decreased operative experiences, less time on CTS services, and frequent reassignment to COVID-19-specific care settings.","Smood, Benjamin; Spratt, John R; Mehaffey, J Hunter; Luc, Jessica G Y; Vinck, Eric E; Lehtinen, Miia L; Wallen, Tyler J; Jenkinson, Charles G; Kim, Woojung; Kesieme, Emeka B; Han, Jason J; Helmers, Mark R; Iyengar, Amit; Patrick, William L; Kelly, John J; Watkins, Ammara A; Cevasco, Marisa; Williams, Matthew L",J Card Surg,479,1

In the academic environment, hypoxia is a current topic of research in biology, physiology and medicine: in October 2020, there were more than 150,000 occurrences of ""hypoxia"" in the PubMed database. However, the first occurrence is dated in 1945, while the interest for the effects of oxygen lack on the living organisms started in the mid 19thcentury, when scientists explored high altitude regions and mainly used the terms ""anoxia"" or ""anoxemia"". I therefore made an Internet research through multiple databases to look for the first appearance of ""hypoxia"" and related terms ""hypoxemia"" and ""hypoxybiosis"" in the scientific literature published in English, German, French, Italian and Spanish. Viault and Jolyet used ""Hypohématose"" in 1894, but this word was never used since. Hypoxybiosis appeared first in 1909 in Germany, then hypoxemia in 1923 in Austria and hypoxia in 1938 in Holland. It was then exported to United States where it appeared in 1940 in cardiology and anesthesiology. The clinical distinction between anoxia and hypoxia was clearly defined by Carl Wiggers in 1941. Hypoxia (decrease in oxygen), by essence variable in time and in localization in the body, in contrast with anoxia (absence of oxygen), illustrates the concept of homeodynamics that defines a living organism as a complex system in permanent instability, exposed to environmental and internal perturbations.","Richalet, Jean-Paul",,479,15

Providing family interventions is hampered by patient resistance, social stigma, logistics and factors related to the capacity of the treatment programmes. AIMS: The purpose of the study was to examine the association between family engagement in treatment, and opioid use defined by percentage negative opioid screen and rate retention in treatment defined by completion of study period. METHODS: Data from a 16-week outpatient randomised controlled trial (RCT) of 141 adults with opioid use disorder (OUD) receiving Opioid Assisted Treatment (OAT) using buprenorphine/naloxone film (BUP/NX-F) was, used to examine the association between family engagement in and opioid use and rate of retention in treatment. Multiple logistic regression was, applied to examine the independent prediction of family engagement on opioid use and rate retention in treatment. RESULTS: Family engagement was significantly associated with retention in treatment (Spearman's rho 0.25, p < 0.01) and was subsequently found to increase the likelihood of retention in treatment by approximately 3-fold (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 2.95, 95% CI 1.31-6.65). CONCLUSION: Family engagement in treatment is an independent predictor of retention in treatment but not opioid use in adults receiving OAT. It is, recommended that SUD treatment programmes integrate family related interventions in mainstream treatment. Delivering a personalised multicomponent family programme using digitised virtual communications that has been increasingly utilised during the Covid-19 pandemic is highly suggested.","Al Ghafri, Hamad; Hasan, Nael; Elarabi, Hesham Farouk; Radwan, Doa; Shawky, Mansour; Al Mamari, Samya; Abdelgawad, Tarek; El Rashid, Abuelgasim; Kodera, Ayman; Al Kathiri, Helal; Lee, Amanda J; Wanigaratne, Shamil",Int J Soc Psychiatry,479,16

Here, we report a new CRISPR-mediated test, called CRISPR-top (CRISPR-mediated testing in one-pot), which integrates simultaneous target pre-amplification with CRISPR/cas12b-mediated detection into a one-pot reaction mixture, performed at a constant temperature. The novel CRISPR-top assay was applied to detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent for COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019). COVID-19 CRISPR-top targets the ORF1ab (opening reading frame 1a/b) and NP (nucleoprotein) genes of SARS-CoV-2, and operates at 59 °C for 40 min with minimal instrument. The COVID-19 CRISPR-top assay can return results within 60-min and is easily interpreted by visual fluorescence or lateral flow readouts. The analytical limit of detection (LoD) for COVID-19 CRISPR-top is 10 copies (for each detection target) per reaction with no cross-reactivity observed from non-SARS-CoV-2 templates. Among clinically collected non-COVID-19 samples, the assay's specificity was 100% (80/80 oropharynx swab samples). Among 52 COVID-19 positive clinical samples collected, the COVID-19 CRISPR-top assay yielded 38 (73.1%) positive results using fluorescence readout and 35 (67.3%) positive results with lateral-flow readout. These diagnostic results were similar to those obtained using RT-PCR (34 positive (65.4%)). These data indicate that COVID-19 CRISPR-top is a simple, rapid, accurate and highly sensitive method for SARS-CoV-2 detection which can be used in the clinic, field laboratories and primary care facilities in resource-challenged settings.","Li, Shijun; Huang, Junfei; Ren, Lijuan; Jiang, Weijia; Wang, Ming; Zhuang, Li; Zheng, Qinni; Yang, Rui; Zeng, Yi; Luu, Laurence Don Wai; Wang, Yi; Tai, Jun",Talanta,479,16

We discuss the merits and disadvantages of each approach, we interpret the parameters of the model and assess the realistic nature of the parameters resulting from the optimization procedure. Importantly, we explore a model involving two sub-populations (younger and older than a specific age), to more accurately reflect the observed impact as concerns symptoms and behavior in different age groups. For definiteness and to separate people that are (typically) in the active workforce, our partition of population is with respect to members younger vs. older than the age of 65. The basic reproduction number of the model is computed for both the single- and the two-population variant.

Alongside other specialized pharmacists, we re-evaluated daily processes and therapies used to treat COVID-19 patients within our institutions from a cardiovascular perspective and share what we have learned. Objectives: To develop a collaborative approach for cardiology issues and concerns in the care of confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients by drawing on the experiences of cardiology pharmacists across the country. Methods: On March 26, 2020, a conference call was convened composed of 24 cardiology residency-trained pharmacists (23 actively practicing in cardiology and 1 in critical care) from 16 institutions across the United States to discuss cardiology issues each have encountered with COVID-19 patients. Discussion centered around providing optimal pharmaceutical care while limiting staff exposure. Results: The collaborative of pharmacists found for the ST-elevation myocardial infarction patient, many institutions were diverting COVID-19 rule-out patients to their Emergency Department (ED). Thrombolytics are an alternative to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) allowing for timely treatment of patients and decreased staff exposure. An emergency response grab and go kit includes initial drugs and airway equipment so the patient can be treated and the cart can be left outside the room. Cardiology pharmacists have developed policies and procedures to address monitoring of QT prolonging medications, the use of inhaled prostacyclins, and national drug shortages. Technology has allowed us to practice social distancing, while staying in close contact with our teams, patients, and colleagues and continuing to teach. Residents are engaged in unique decision-making processes with their preceptors and assist as pharmacist extenders. Conclusion: Cardiology pharmacists are in a unique position to work with other pharmacists and health care professionals to implement safe and effective practice changes during the COVID-19 pandemic.

We present a case of delayed clinical progression of COVID-19 associated respiratory failure on day 25 after initial symptom onset and, notably, after initial full resolution of symptoms and negative RT-PCR nasopharyngeal testing. The patient's delayed presentation of exertional dyspnea and the utilization of specific characteristics of chest radiography in confirmation with laboratory cytokine measurement allowed for clinical re-categorization of the patient's status to active COVID-19 clinical disease and changed acute management. COVID-19 positive patients should be advised to continue to monitor for respiratory deterioration for a greatly extended period of time, even if RT-PCR testing is negative and initial clinical symptoms have resolved. Frontline healthcare workers, including first responders and primary care providers, also need to be aware to monitor for and recognize this delayed presentation.","Hedges, Mary S; Jackson, Kensler D; Matcha, Gautam V; Ramakrishna, Jahanavi M; Libertin, Claudia R",Rom. j. intern. med,479,24

Morphologies, textures, surface functionalities, and thermal stabilities of both adsorbents were explored using SEM, EDX, TEM, BET, FT-IR, Raman, XRD and TGA analyses. SEM analysis showed meso- and macroporous surfaces. BET data showed that the MAG–OSBC possesses a larger surface area (33.82 m2/g) and pore volume. Batch adsorption studies were conducted following the experimental scenario of Box–Behnken (BB) design. The adsorption efficiency of both adsorbents was evaluated in terms of the % removal (%R) and the sorption capacity (qe, mg/g). Dependent variables (%R and qe) were maximized as a function of four factors: pH, sorbent dose (AD), the concentration of CLOF ([CLOF]), and contact time (CT). A %R of 98.10% and 98.61% could be obtained using OSBC and MAG–OSBC, respectively. Equilibrium studies indicated that both Langmuir and Freundlich models were perfectly fit for adsorption of CLOF. Maximum adsorption capacity (qmax) of 174.03 mg/g was obtained using MAG–OSBC. Adsorption kinetics could be best illustrated using the pseudo-second-order (PSO) model. The adsorption–desorption studies showed that both adsorbents could be restored with the adsorption efficiency being conserved up to 92% after the sixth cycles.","Nabil, Iman Hassan Siham S.; El-Shafie, Ahmed S.",Nanomaterials,479,30

The COVID-19 pandemic has addressed the first of the 2 problems-technology solutions, such as telemedicine, that were struggling to find traction are now closely aligned with health-seeking behavior. The second problem (poorly designed solutions) persists, as demonstrated by a plethora of poorly designed epidemic prediction tools and digital contact-tracing apps, which were deployed at scale, around the world, with little validation.

It is obvious that SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is needed to control the global COVID-19 public health crisis. Since obvious advantages including fast manufacturing speed, potent immunogenicity and good safety profile, six mRNA vaccines have been used to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infections in clinic with lipid nanoparticles (LNP) formulation via intramuscular injection. In this work, we first constructed RBD-encoding mRNA (RBD-mRNA) formulated in liposomes (LPX/RBD-mRNA) and investigated the influence of administration routes on the immunogenicity. LPX/RBD-mRNA can express RBD in vivo and successfully induced SARS-CoV-2 RBD specific antibodies in the vaccinated mice, which efficiently neutralized SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virus. Moreover, the administration routes were found to affect the virus neutralizing capacity of sera derived from the immunized mice and the types (Th1-type and Th2-type) of cellular immune responses. This study indicated that liposome-based RBD-mRNA vaccine with optimal administration route might be a potential candidate against SARS-CoV-2 infection with good efficacy and safety.","Huang, Hai; Zhang, Caili; Yang, Shuping; Xiao, Wen; Zheng, Qian; Song, Xiangrong",J Control Release,479,16

Based on two seemingly disparate cases, South Africa and Canada, I suggest that these expansions provide valuable opportunities for rethinking existing approaches to livelihoods, labour and social protection. These interventions also provide political possibilities through which a more radically redistributive politics can be articulated. In both contexts, state responses have provoked new challenges, dialogues, and experiments in distribution at multiple scales, from the neighbourhood to the nation state. This reflection calls for deeper inquiry into the multiple meanings of cash transfers and the political openings they provide.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using a representative healthcare claims database of approx. 4 million adults to estimate the incidence rates (IR) and associated mortality of CAP in 2015. IR and mortality were stratified by treatment setting, age group, and risk group status. A pneumonia coded in the primary diagnosis position or in the second diagnosis position with another pneumonia-related condition coded in the primary position was used as the base cases definition for the study. Sensitivity analyses using broader and more restrictive case definitions were also performed. RESULTS: The overall IR of CAP in adults &#8805;18 years was 1,054 cases per 100,000 person-years of observation. In adults aged 16 to 59 years, IR for overall CAP, hospitalized CAP and outpatient CAP was 551, 96 and 466 (with a hospitalization rate of 17%). In adults aged &#8805;60 years, the respective IR were 2,032, 1,061 and 1,053 (with a hospitalization rate of 52%). If any pneumonia coded in the primary or secondary diagnosis position was considered for hospitalized patients, the IR increased 1.5-fold to 1,560 in the elderly &#8805;60 years. The incidence of CAP hospitalizations was substantially higher in adults &#8805;18 years with at-risk conditions and high-risk conditions (IR of 608 and 1,552, respectively), compared to adults without underlying risk conditions (IR 108). High mortality of hospitalized CAP in adults &#8805;18 was observed in-hospital (18.5%), at 30 days (22.9%) and at one-year (44.5%) after CAP onset. Mortality was more than double in older adults in comparison to younger patients. CONCLUSION: CAP burden in older adults and individuals with underlying risk conditions was high. Maximizing uptake of existing vaccines for respiratory diseases may help to mitigate the disease burden, especially in times of strained healthcare resources.","Theilacker, Christian; Sprenger, Ralf; Leverkus, Friedhelm; Walker, Jochen; Häckl, Dennis; von Eiff, Christof; Schiffner-Rohe, Julia",PLoS One,479,26

AKI is associated with high mortality in the clinical setting and contributes to the transition of AKI to chronic kidney disease (CKD). Up to date, the underlying mechanisms are obscure and there is no effective and specific treatment for COVID-19-induced AKI. In the present study, we investigated the mechanisms and interactions between Quercetin and SARS-CoV-2 targets proteins by using network pharmacology and molecular docking. The renal protective effects of Quercetin on COVID-19-induced AKI may be associated with the blockade of the activation of inflammatory, cell apoptosis-related signaling pathways. Quercetin may also serve as SARS-CoV-2 inhibitor by binding with the active sites of SARS-CoV-2 main protease 3CL and ACE2, therefore suppressing the functions of the proteins to cut the viral life cycle.

The results of the analysis suggest a possible relationship between COVID-19 and hearing loss, with no evidence of a similar relationship between this virus and the balance system. The possible existence of such a relationship should be especially remembered by hospital emergency room doctors, otolaryngologists and audiologists, especially as regards the possibility of a sudden sensironeural hearing loss as the first symptom of COVID-19. This also applies to doctors of other specialties. The authors indicate the need for further, intensive and multifaceted research on this issue.

Herein, we will focus on some recently studied forms of human adaptation to infectious agents, including hybridization with now-extinct hominins, such as Neanderthals and Denisovans, and admixture between modern human populations. These studies, which are partly enabled by the technological advances in the sequencing of DNA from ancient remains, provide new insight into the sources of immune response variation in contemporary humans, such as the recently reported link between Neanderthal heritage and susceptibility to severe COVID-19 disease. Furthermore, ancient DNA analyses, in both humans and pathogens, allow to measure the action of natural selection on immune genes across time and to reconstruct the impact of past epidemics on the evolution of human immunity.","Kerner, Gaspard; Patin, Etienne; Quintana-Murci, Lluis",Curr Opin Immunol,479,16

METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 857 PLWH and 1048 HIV negative individuals were enrolled from the Wuchang district in Wuhan, China. We compared the total rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the rate of COVID-19, asymptomatic carriers, and unapparent infectors in the two groups. The risk factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection among PLWH were explored. RESULTS: Fourteen out of 857 (1.63%) PLWH were infected with SARS-CoV-2, while 68 of 1048 (6.49%) HIV negative individuals were infected. In PLWH, there were 6 confirmed COVID-19 (0.70%), 4 asymptomatic carriers (0.47%) and 4 unapparent infectors (0.47%). In the HIV negative group, the cases of COVID-19, asymptomatic carrier, and unapparent infector were 5 (0.48%), 0 (0.00%), and 63 (6.01%), respectively. After adjusting for age, gender, and chronic comorbidities, the rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection in PLWH was lower than that in HIV negative group (1.96% vs 5.74%, P=0.001). The morbidity of COVID-19 was similar between the two groups (P=0.107), but the rate of unapparent infection in PLWH was lower than that in the HIV negative group (0.54% vs 5.46%, P=0.001). Older age (aOR=4.50, 95%CI: 1.34-15.13, P=0.015) and OIs (aOR=9.59, 95%CI: 1.54-59.92, P=0.016) were risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection among PLWH. CONCLUSIONS: PLWH has different infection forms of SARS-CoV-2 compared with the general population. Older age and OIs were considered to driving causes of SARS-CoV-2 infection among PLWH.","Wu, M.; Ming, F.; Wu, S.; Liu, Y.; Zhang, X.; Guo, W.; Marly, G.; Tang, W.; Liang, K.",,479,20

The rapid global spread of COVID-19 is attributed to the increased human mobility of today's world, yet the threat of viral infections to global public health is expected to increase continuously in part due to increasing human-animal interface. Development of antiviral agents is crucial to combat both existing and novel viral infections. Recently, there is a growing interest in peptide/protein-based drug molecules. Antibodies are becoming especially predominant in the drug market. Indeed, in a remarkably short period, four antibody therapeutics were authorized for emergency use in COVID-19 treatment in the US, Russia, and India as of November 2020. Phage display has been one of the most widely used screening methods for peptide/antibody drug discovery. Several phage display-derived biologics are already in the market, and the expiration of intellectual property rights of phage-display antibody discovery platforms suggests an increment in antibody drugs in the near future. This review summarizes the most common phage display libraries used in antiviral discovery, highlights the approaches employed to enhance the antiviral potency of selected peptides/antibody fragments, and finally provides a discussion about the present status of the developed antivirals in clinic.","Sokullu, Esen; Gauthier, Marie-Soleil; Coulombe, Benoit",Viruses,479,1

The proposed method has been used for the diagnosis of pneumonia caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) using chest X-ray image (CXI) and chest computer tomography image (CCTI). The FBSED method is used to decompose CXI and CCTI into sub-band images (SBIs). The SBIs are then used to train various pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) models separately using a transfer learning approach. The combination of SBI and CNN is termed as one channel. Deep features from each channel are fused to get a feature vector. Different classifiers are used to classify pneumonia caused by COVID-19 from other viral and bacterial pneumonia and healthy subjects with the extracted feature vector. The different combinations of channels have also been analyzed to make the process computationally efficient. For CXI and CCTI databases, the best performance has been obtained with only one and four channels, respectively. The proposed model was evaluated using 5-fold and 10-fold cross-validation processes. The average accuracy for the CXI database was 100% for both 5-fold and 10-fold cross-validation processes, and for the CCTI database, it is 97.6% for the 5-fold cross-validation process. Therefore, the proposed method may be used by radiologists to rapidly diagnose patients with COVID-19.","Chaudhary, Pradeep Kumar; Pachori, Ram Bilas",Comput Biol Med,479,16

We consider the ways in which soft political factors operate in guideline development processes at NICE such that guidelines are not truly led by science. We suggest that while NICE procedures explicitly incorporate scientific principles and mechanisms, including independent committees and quality assurance, these fail to operate as scientific practices because, for example, decisions may only be challenged through the courts, which regard NICE as a scientific authority. We then examine what the NICE rapid guideline procedure for COVID-19 reveals about the practical reality of claims about the scientific integrity of NICE guidelines. Changes to guideline development processes during the COVID-19 emergency demonstrated how easy it is to undermine the scientific integrity of NICE's decision-making. The cancellation of the guideline programme and the publication of a rapid guideline process specifically to address the COVID-19 pandemic removed scientific checks and balances, including independent committees, stakeholder consultation and quality assurance, demonstrating that the relationship between NICE and the UK government is more complex than a scientific principle truism. We suggest that NICE is not (and indeed cannot be) truly independent of government in practice, nor can it be truly led by science, in part because of its relationship to the state, which it is simultaneously constituted by and constitutive of.","McPherson, S J; Speed, Ewen",BMJ Evid.

This decrease leads to less time in the surgical room to develop and improve the surgical skills of residents. In this study, we developed a training program to obtain and maintain microsurgical skills at home, using a smartphone camera and low-cost materials, affordable for everyone. METHODS: Using a smartphone camera as a magnification device, 6 participants performed 5 exercises (coloring grids, grouping colors, unraveling of a gauze, knots with suture threads, and tower of Hanoi), both with the dominant and with the nondominant hand, for 4 weeks. We compared performance at the beginning and at the end of the training process. Each participant filled out an anonymous survey. RESULTS: When we compared the performance at the beginning and at the end of the training process, we found significant improvements (P = 0.05) with the dominant as well as the nondominant hand in all the exercises. All participants were satisfied or very satisfied with the definition of the objectives of the training process, material availability, the exercises performed, the choice of the time to train, and general satisfaction with the training program.

The impact of prone position in critically ill patients with coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) remains to be determined. In this review, we describe the mechanisms of action of prone position, systematically appraise the current experience of prone position in COVID-19 patients, and highlight unique considerations for prone position practices during this pandemic. METHODS: For our systematic review, we searched PubMed, Scopus and EMBASE from January 1, 2020, to April 16, 2020. After completion of our search, we became aware of four relevant publications during article preparation that were published in May and June 2020, and these studies were reviewed for eligibility and inclusion. We included all studies reporting clinical characteristics of patients admitted to the hospital with COVID-19 disease who received respiratory support with high-flow nasal cannula, or noninvasive or mechanical ventilation and reported the use of prone position. The full text of eligible articles was reviewed, and data regarding study design, patient characteristics, interventions and outcomes were extracted. RESULTS: We found seven studies (total 1899 patients) describing prone position in COVID-19. Prone position has been increasingly used in non-intubated patients with COVID-19; studies show high tolerance and improvement in oxygenation and lung recruitment. Published studies lacked a description of important clinical outcomes (e.g., mortality, duration of mechanical ventilation). CONCLUSIONS: Based on the findings of our review, we recommend prone position in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 ARDS as per existing guidelines. A trial of prone position should be considered for non-intubated COVID-19 patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure, as long as this does not result in a delay in intubation.","Qadri, Syeda Kashfi; Ng, Priscilla; Toh, Theresa Shu Wen; Loh, Sin Wee; Tan, Herng Lee; Lin, Cheryl Bin; Fan, Eddy; Lee, Jan Hau",Pulm Ther,479,20

At the time of its arrival in Italy, available literary data were meager, and most of them concerned its epidemiology. World Health Organization proposed guidelines in march 2020, a strategy of treatment has been developed, and a significant number of subsequent articles have been published to understand, prevent, and cure COVID patients. METHODS: From the observation of two patients, we performed a careful analysis of scientific literature to unearth the relation between COVID infection, clinical manifestations as pneumonia and thrombosis, and to find out why it frequently affects obese, diabetics, and elderly patients. RESULTS: The analysis shows that hepcidin could represent one of such correlating factors. Hepcidin is most elevated in older age, in non-insulin diabetics patients and in obese people. It is the final target therapy of many medicaments frequently used. Viral disease, and in particular SARS-CoV19, could induce activation of the hepcidin pathway, which in turn is responsible for an increase in the iron load. Excess of iron can lead to cell death by ferroptosis and release into the bloodstream, such as free iron, which in turn has toxic and pro-coagulative effects. CONCLUSIONS: Overexpression of hepcidin and iron overload might play a crucial role in COVID infection, becoming potential targets for treatment. Hepcidin could also be considered as a biomarker to measure the effectiveness of our treatments and the restoration of iron homeostasis the final intent.

Methods: During December 2019-April 2020, the sequential CT images of 30 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were retrospectively analyzed from admission to follow-up. The qualitative evolution tendency of lung abnormalities and semi-quantitative CT scores were analyzed for temporal change. Results: The mean hospitalized period was 24.5 ± 9.6 days (range 6-49 days). The average time from the first, second, third, fourth and follow-up CT examination to the initial symptom onset were 4.2 ± 3.1 days, 10.7 ± 4.4 days, 17.1 ± 3.9 days, 24.6 ± 7.5 days, and 42.4 ± 15.6 days, respectively. During illness day 0-5, groundglass opacity (GGO) was the main pattern. The following illness day 6-11, the main CT pattern was consolidation and reticular pattern. The consolidation and reticular pattern gradually dissipate during illness day 12-23, and the reticular pattern and light GGO increased. When illness day was &#8805; 24 days, the reticular pattern and light GGO gradually decrease until complete dissipation. The highest CT score was at illness day 6-11. Pearson correlation analysis showed that the mean and maximum CT score were not correlated with the length of fever (r = 0.018, p = 0.923 and r = 0.086, p = 0.652) and hospitalization (r = 0.192, p = 0.31 and r = 0.273, p = 0.144). Conclusions: The dynamic evolution of CT manifestation in moderate to severe COVID-19 pneumonia patients followed a specific pattern over time. During illness day 6-11, the extent of lung abnormalities on chest CT was the most severe.

METHODS: This retrospective cohort study examined data from every patient who tested positive for COVID-19 and was admitted to White Plains Hospital between March 9, 2020, and June 3, 2020. We used binomial logistic regression to analyze data for all patients, and propensity score matching for those treated with hydroxychloroquine and convalescent plasma (CP). The primary outcome of interest was inpatient mortality. RESULTS: 1,108 admitted patients with COVID-19 were available for analysis, of which 124 (11.2%) were excluded due to incomplete data. Of the 984 patients included, 225 (22.9%) died. Risk for death decreased for each day later a patient was admitted [OR 0.970, CI 0.955 to 0.985; p < 0.001]. Elevated initial C-reactive protein (CRP) value was associated with a higher risk for death at 96 hours [OR 1.007, 1.002 to 1.012; p = 0.006]. Hydroxychloroquine and CP administration were each associated with increased mortality [OR 3.4, CI 1.614 to 7.396; p = 0.002, OR 2.8560, CI 1.361 to 6.160; p = 0.006 respectively]. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated CRP carried significant odds of early death. Hydroxychloroquine and CP were each associated with higher risk for death, although CP was without titers and was administered at a median of five days from admission. Randomized or controlled studies will better describe the impact of CP. Mortality decreased as the pandemic progressed, suggesting that institutional capacity for dynamic evaluation of process and outcome measures may benefit COVID-19 survival.","Sammartino, Daniel; Jafri, Farrukh; Cook, Brennan; La, Lisa; Kim, Hyemin; Cardasis, John; Raff, Joshua",PLoS One,479,5

Smokers have higher risk of mortality and have a more severe clinical course. There is paucity of data available on this issue, and a definitive link between smoking and COVID-19 prognosis has yet to be established. Methods: We included 5224 patients with COVID-19 with an available smoking history in a multicentre international registry Health Outcome Predictive Evaluation for COVID-19 (NCT04334291). Patients were included following an in-hospital admission with a COVID-19 diagnosis. We analysed the outcomes of patients with a current or prior history of smoking compared with the non-smoking group. The primary endpoint was all-cause in-hospital death. Results: Finally, 5224 patients with COVID-19 with available smoking status were analysed. A total of 3983 (67.9%) patients were non-smokers, 934 (15.9%) were former smokers and 307 (5.2%) were active smokers. The median age was 66 years (IQR 52.0-77.0) and 58.6% were male. The most frequent comorbidities were hypertension (48.5%) and dyslipidaemia (33.0%). A relevant lung disease was present in 19.4%. In-hospital complications such sepsis (23.6%) and embolic events (4.3%) occurred more frequently in the smoker group (p&lt;0.001 for both). All cause-death was higher among smokers (active or former smokers) compared with non-smokers (27.6 vs 18.4%, p&lt;0.001). Following a multivariate analysis, current smoking was considered as an independent predictor of mortality (OR 1.77, 95% CI 1.11 to 2.82, p=0.017) and a combined endpoint of severe disease (OR 1.68, 95% CI 1.16 to 2.43, p=0.006).

In the United States, COVID-19 is not only causing physical suffering to patients, but also great levels of adverse sentiment (e.g., fear, panic, anxiety) among the public. Such secondary threats can be anticipated and explained through sentiment analysis of social media, such as Twitter. MethodsWe obtained a dataset of geotagged tweets on the topic of COVID-19 in the contiguous United States during the period of 11/1/2019 - 9/15/2020. We classified each tweet into ""adverse"" and ""non-adverse"" using the NRC Emotion Lexicon and tallied up the counts for each category per county per day. We utilized the space-time scan statistic to find clusters and a three-stage regression approach to identify socioeconomic and demographic correlates of adverse sentiment. ResultsWe identified substantial spatiotemporal variation in adverse sentiment in our study area/period. After an initial period of low-level adverse sentiment (11/1/2019 - 1/15/2020), we observed a steep increase and subsequent fluctuation at a higher level (1/16/2020 - 9/15/2020). The number of daily tweets was low initially (11/1/2019 - 1/22/2020), followed by spikes and subsequent decreases until the end of the study period. The space-time scan statistic identified 12 clusters of adverse sentiment of varying size, location, and strength. Clusters were generally active during the time period of late March to May/June 2020. Increased adverse sentiment was associated with decreased racial/ethnic heterogeneity, decreased rurality, higher vulnerability in terms of minority status and language, and housing type and transportation. ConclusionsWe utilized a dataset of geotagged tweets to identify the spatiotemporal patterns and the spatial correlates of adverse population sentiment during the first two waves of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. The characteristics of areas with high adverse sentiment may be relevant for communication of containment measures. The combination of spatial clustering and regression can be beneficial for understanding of the ramifications of COVID-19, as well as disease outbreaks in general.","Hohl, Alexander; Choi, Moongi; Medina, Richard; Wan, Neng; Wen, Ming",,479,16

It helps the entry of novel coronavirus (n-CoV) or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the host cell. Successful inhibition of the TMPRSS2 can be one of the crucial strategies to stop the SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the present study, a set of bioactive molecules from Morus alba Linn. were screened against the TMPRSS2 through two widely used molecular docking engines such as Autodock vina and Glide. Molecules having a higher binding affinity toward the TMPRSS2 compared to Camostat and Ambroxol were considered for in-silico pharmacokinetic analyses. Based on acceptable pharmacokinetic parameters and drug-likeness, finally, five molecules were found to be important for the TMPRSS2 inhibition. A number of bonding interactions in terms of hydrogen bond and hydrophobic interactions were observed between the proposed molecules and ligand-interacting amino acids of the TMPRSS2. The dynamic behavior and stability of best-docked complex between TRMPRSS2 and proposed molecules were assessed through molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Several parameters from MD simulation have suggested the stability between the protein and ligands. Binding free energy of each molecule calculated through MM-GBSA approach from the MD simulation trajectory suggested strong affection toward the TMPRSS2. Hence, proposed molecules might be crucial chemical components for the TMPRSS2 inhibition.","Shakya, Anshul; Chikhale, Rupesh V; Bhat, Hans Raj; Alasmary, Fatmah Ali; Almutairi, Tahani Mazyad; Ghosh, Surajit Kumar; Alhajri, Hassna Mohammed; Alissa, Siham A; Nagar, Shuchi; Islam, Md Ataul",Mol. divers,479,26

Myeloid skewing of hematopoietic cells is a prominent promoter of metastasis. However, the reservoir of these cells in the bone marrow (BM) compartment and their differentiation pattern from hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) have not been explored. METHODS: We used a unique model system consisting of tumor cell clones with low metastatic potential or high metastatic potential (met-low and met-high, respectively) to investigate the fate of HSPC differentiation using murine melanoma and breast carcinoma. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis was performed on HSPC obtained from the BM of met-low and met-high tumors. A proteomic screen of tumor-conditioned medium integrated with the scRNA-seq data analysis was performed to analyze the potential cross talk between cancer cells and HSPCs. Adoptive transfer of tumor-educated HSPC subsets obtained from green fluorescent protein (GFP)+ tagged mice was then carried out to identify the contribution of committed HSPCs to tumor spread. Peripheral mononuclear cells obtained from patients with breast and lung cancer were analyzed for HSPC subsets. RESULTS: Mice bearing met-high tumors exhibited a significant increase in the percentage of HSPCs in the BM in comparison with tumor-free mice or mice bearing met-low tumors. ScRNA-seq analysis of these HSPCs revealed that met-high tumors enriched the monocyte-dendritic progenitors (MDPs) but not granulocyte-monocyte progenitors (GMPs). A proteomic screen of tumor- conditioned medium integrated with the scRNA-seq data analysis revealed that the interleukin 6 (IL-6)-IL-6 receptor axis is highly active in HSPC-derived MDP cells. Consequently, loss of function and gain of function of IL-6 in tumor cells resulted in decreased and increased metastasis and corresponding MDP levels, respectively. Importantly, IL-6-educated MDPs induce metastasis within mice bearing met-low tumors-through further differentiation into immunosuppressive macrophages and not dendritic cells. Consistently, MDP but not GMP levels in peripheral blood of breast and lung cancer patients are correlated with tumor aggressiveness. CONCLUSIONS: Our study reveals a new role for tumor-derived IL-6 in hijacking the HSPC differentiation program toward prometastatic MDPs that functionally differentiate into immunosuppressive monocytes to support the metastatic switch.","Magidey-Klein, Ksenia; Cooper, Tim J; Kveler, Ksenya; Normand, Rachelly; Zhang, Tongwu; Timaner, Michael; Raviv, Ziv; James, Brian P; Gazit, Roi; Ronai, Ze039; ev, A; Shen-Orr, Shai; Shaked, Yuval",J. immunotherap. cancer,479,24

It was evident in our research that animal models only mimic limited signs and symptoms experienced in COVID infection as compared to infections in humans. However, they are still essential to understand the pathogenesis, transmissibility of viral particles, and vaccine testing.","Moothedath, Muhamood Muhamood Muhaseena Bhosale Yadnit Bhatia Aseem Gupta Pranav Reddy Medapati Tiwari Rahul",Journal of Pharmacy and Bioallied Sciences,479,30

The COVID-19 pandemic caused a mass transition to online learning, removed students from clinical settings, and underscored students' desires for meaningful VAME opportunities. The authors introduced the Stanford Frontline COVID-19 Consult Service (SFCS), through which off-service medical and physician assistant (PA) students provided assistance to clinicians in the form of rapid research regarding COVID-19 clinical questions. APPROACH: The SFCS, a student-derived VAME initiative, was implemented from March to May 2020 by Stanford University medical students, PA students, and faculty. SFCS aligned with not only the interests of clinicians and students, but also national accreditation standards. Students attended weekly editorial meetings, didactic sessions on literature reviews and information management, and they underwent rigorous training on the peer-review process. After two months, the authors expanded the service to local community clinicians. OUTCOMES: The SFCS enrolled 16 students, was supported by 13 faculty members, and produced 87 peer-reviewed evidence syntheses. Of the 16 SFCS students, 13 (81%) completed evaluations; of 128 Stanford Primary Care and Population Health clinicians, 48 (38%) completed evaluations. Overall student satisfaction with the SFCS was 4.9/5 (standard deviation [SD] 0.3). Self-assessed achievement of SFCS learning objectives exceeded 90% for all objectives. Overall faculty satisfaction with the SFCS was 4.4/5 (SD 0.8). Most faculty (40/46 [87%]) planned to use the database to answer future COVID-19 questions. NEXT STEPS: The SFCS is a novel, student-initiated VAME curriculum focused on increasing students' meaningful contributions to patient care. The authors will track SFCS students throughout their clerkships to gauge clerkship performance/preparedness, and they will develop training for integrating VAME into preclerkship curricula at other institutions. Given its adaptive, student-driven design, the VAME framework used to develop the SFCS empowers students to create their own personalized, experiential learning.","Zhou, Bright; Calkins, Christopher; Jayaraman, Tanvi; Cassells, Sandrene; Rotto, Torsten; Vaughan, Laura; Srinivasan, Malathi; Schillinger, Erika",Acad. med,479,12

Previous surveys have been conducted regarding these questions, and guidelines from national organizations have been issued, but practices remain varied among institutions. METHODS: We conducted a narrative review of the literature related to the timing of CLP rotations and generated consensus recommendations based on our experience as program directors, rotation leaders, and residents. RESULTS: Explicit goals of CLP training in residency include identifying and treating psychiatric manifestation of medical illness and communicating effectively with primary teams. Implicit goals of training may includeconflict management, limit setting, and ""thinking dirty."" DISCUSSION: Although CLP rotations earlier in residency often create a better fit within the overarching curriculum and allow for generating early interest in the field, significant amounts of supervision are required, and consultees may look to attendings as the primary consultant. Conversely, while later rotations are sometimes challenging to structure with other outpatient responsibilities, they allow for greater autonomy and may map better onto the informal curriculum. A hybrid model, with training spread across multiple years, is another approach that may mitigate some of the disadvantages of confining consultation-liaison training to a single year. Compelling arguments can be made for placing the core CLP rotation in postgraduate year 2 or 3 or using a hybrid model. Regardless of placement, program directors and rotation leaders should be mindful of tailoring the rotation to the trainees' developmental stage.","Beach, Scott R; Shalev, Daniel; Fischel, Steven V; Boland, Robert J; Ernst, Carrie L",Psychosomatics,479,16

This was the case in with both the SARS and MERS epidemics and has also recently been described with the massive surveillance of the SARS-CoV-2 genome since its emergence. During routine molecular surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 performed at the National Reference Center of Respiratory Viruses (Lyon, France) (n=229 sequences collected Feb-April 2020), two frameshifting deletions were detected in the open reading frame 6, starting at the same position (27267). While a 26-nucleotide deletion variant (D26) was only found in one nasopharyngeal sample in March 2020, the 34-nucleotide deletion variant D34) was found within a single geriatric hospital unit in 5/9 patients and one health care worker in April 2020. Phylogeny analysis strongly suggested a nosocomial transmission between patients for D34, with potential fecal transmission, as D34 was also identified in a stool sample. No difference in disease severity was observed within the patients hospitalized in the geriatric unit and infected with WT (n=4) or D34 (n=5). In vitro characterization of D26 and D34 revealed comparable replication kinetics with the wild-type (WT), but differential host immune responses. While interferon-stimulated genes were similarly upregulated after infection withWTand ORF6 deletion variants, the latter specifically induced overexpression of 9 genes coding for inflammatory cytokines in the NF-kB pathway, including CCL2/MCP1, PTX3, and TNF, for which high plasma levels of these cytokines have been associated with severe Covid-19. Given the heterogeneous clinical manifestations of Covid-19 and the growing global prevelance of certain SARS-CoV-2 variants, our findings emphasize the need to monitor the occurrence of ORF6 deletions and assess their impact on the host immune response.","Queromes, G.; Destras, G.; Bal, A.; Regue, H.; Burfin, G.; Brun, S.; Fanget, R.; Morfin, F.; Valette, M.; Trouillet-Assant, S.; Lina, B.; Frobert, E.; Josset, L.",Virologie,479,29

Since COVID-19 became a global pandemic, the ""super spread"" of the virus has continued to amaze policymakers despite measures put in place by public health officials to sensitize the general public on the need for social distancing, personal hygiene, etc. In this work, we have reviewed the literature to demonstrate, by investigating the historical and present circumstances, that indoor spread of infectious diseases may be assisted by the conditions of the HVAC systems. While little consideration has been given to the possibility of indoor airborne transmission of the virus, the available reports have demonstrated that the virus, with average aerodynamic diameter up to 80-120 nm, is viable as aerosol in indoor atmosphere for more than 3 h, and its spread may be assisted by the HVAC systems.

Recently, it was reported to exert a renoprotective effect in the HK-2 cells and kidneys of diabetic rats, which was induced by one type of GLP-1 analogues liraglutide in the presence of high glucose. However, most of the previous findings mainly focused on its indirect effect in inhibiting the advanced glycation end products. Here, besides glycemic control, we also demonstrated a stimulatory role of liraglutide in promoting autophagy and relieving oxidative stress in Zucker diabetic fatty(ZDF) rats. The renoprotective effect of liraglutide has been demonstrated by significantly decreasing urinary albumin (P<0.01) and ameliorating renal pathological changes (P<0.001) in vivo. Besides that, proliferation of Hkc8 and HEK293 cells have been increased after treating with exendin-4, a GLP-1 receptor agonist. Moreover, the GLP-1 could positively improve the progression of autophagy in vivo and in vitro through regulating the autophagy-related protein LC3 and P62 via AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway. Simultaneously, it could reverse Nrf2 translocation into the nuclei, then suppress oxidative stress. In terms of mechanism, the renoprotective effect of the GLP-1 would be exerted via the GLP1R-AMPK-mTOR-autophagy-ROS signaling axis. The present study not only illustrates the renoprotective effect of the GLP-1 in DKD rats but also in the first time elucidates the underlying mechanism that is independent of controlling glucose, which implies that the GLP-1 might be a novel therapeutic strategy for the prevention and treatment of DKD.","Yang, Shuangli; Lin, Chuman; Zhuo, Xiaoyun; Wang, Jiyu; Rao, Shitao; Xu, Wen; Cheng, Yanzhen; Yang, Li",Am. j. physiol. endocrinol. metab,479,22

Nowadays, it represents a higher risk of severe COVID-19 infection, which may lead to the requirement of a mechanical ventilation in intensive care units and premature death. The increase in relative risk of poor prognosis in presence of obesity is particularly high in patients at a younger age. The underlying mechanisms are multiple: alteration of the respiratory performance, presence of frequent comorbidities (diabetes, hypertension or obstructive sleep apnea), finally inadequate and excessive immunological responses, with massive liberation of cytokines (especially interkeukin-1 and interleukin-6). Thus, COVID-19 may challenge the so-called «obesity paradox» in intensive care units among patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome where obesity is commonly reported as associated with a better prognosis.

While most of the mAbs target the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) binding surface on the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, mAb 47D1 binds only to one side of the receptor binding surface on the RBD. Neutralization by 47D1 is achieved independent of interfering RBD-ACE2 binding. A crystal structure of the mAb-RBD complex shows that the IF motif at the tip of 47D1 CDR H2 interacts with a hydrophobic pocket in the RBD.

Material and methods: We collected demographic, chronological, and clinical data for all patients seen for a possible STI at Hospital La Paz, Centro Sanitario Sandaval, and Centro de Diagnóstico Médico in Madrid and Hospital Costa del Sol in Malaga between March 14, 2020 and June 30, 2020. Results: We identified 674 STI diagnoses. The median age of the patients was 33 years. Most cases were observed among people aged 30 to 40 years and among men who have sex with men. The most common diagnoses were proctitis (36.5%), syphilis (16%), nongonococcal (13.3%) and gonococcal (11.3%) urethritis, genital herpes (8.8%), vulvovaginitis/cervicitis (8.3%), and genital warts (4.2%). A microbiologically confirmed diagnosis was on record for 77% of cases. The main microorganisms identified were Chlamydia trachomatis (35.7%), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (31.4%), and Treponema pallidum (17.2%). The number of STI diagnoses increased after the easing of lockdown restrictions, which resulted in greater freedom of movement and more consultations. On comparing the 2019 and 2020 STI registries from Centro Sanitario Sandoval and Hospital La Paz for the period March to June, we observed reductions (of up to 81%) in all STI diagnoses.

The increase in lipid deposition might be explained by elevated adipogenesis of marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). However, it remains unclear whether there is a close association between elevated adipogenesis and steroid-associated ON development. OBJECTIVE: The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that there might be a close association between elevated adipogenesis and steroid-associated ON development. METHODS: ON rabbit model was induced based on our established protocol. Dynamic-MRI was employed for local intra-osseous perfusion evaluation in bilateral femora. Two weeks after induction, bone marrow was harvested for evaluating the ability of adipogenic differentiation of marrow MSCs at both cellular and mRNA level involving adipogenesis-related gene peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma2 (PPARγ2). The bilateral femora were dissected for examining marrow lipid deposition by quantifying fat cell number, fat cell size, lipid deposition area and ON lesions. For investigating association among adipogenesis, lipid deposition and perfusion function with regard to ON occurrence, the rabbits were divided into ON(+ )(with at least one ON lesion) group and ON(- )(without ON lesion) group. For investigating association among adipogenesis, lipid deposition and perfusion function with regard to ON extension, the ON(+ )rabbits were further divided into sub-single-lesion group (SON group: with one ON lesion) and sub-multiple-lesion group (MON group: with more than one ON lesion). RESULTS: Local intra-osseous perfusion index was found lower in either ON(+ )or MON group when compared to either ON(- )or SON group, whereas the marrow fat cells number and area were much larger in either ON(+ )or MON group as compared with ON(- )and SON group. The adipogenic differentiation ability of MSCs and PPARγ2 expression in either ON(+ )or MON group were elevated significantly as compared with either ON(- )or SON group. CONCLUSION: These findings support our hypothesis that there is a close association between elevated adipogenesis and steroid-associated osteonecrosis development.","Sheng, Hui H; Zhang, Ge G; Cheung, Wing Hoi WH; Chan, Chun Wai CW; Wang, Yi Xiang YX; Lee, Kwong Man KM; Wang, Hong Fu HF; Leung, Kwok Sui KS; Qin, Ling L",J Orthop Surg,479,1

This study aimed to investigate the association between air pollution, assessed as concentrations of particulate matter PM2.5 and PM10 on the upper respiratory tract symptoms (URTS) in children. A nation-wide, questionnaire-based study was conducted in Poland in winter 2018/2019 in a population of 1475 children, comparing URTS throughout the study period with publicly available data on airborne particulate matter. A general regression model was used to evaluate the lag effects between daily changes in PM10 and PM2.5 and the number of children reporting URTS and their severity. PM10 and PM2.5 in the single-pollutant models had significant effects on the number of children reporting URTS. The prevalence of URTS: “runny nose”, “sneezing” and “cough” was positively associated with 12-week mean PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations. In the locations with the highest average concentration of PM, the symptoms of runny nose, cough and sneezing were increased by 10%, 9% and 11%, respectively, compared to the cities with the lowest PM concentrations. This study showed that moderate-term exposure (12 week observation period) to air pollution was associated with an increased risk of URTS among children aged 3–12 years in Poland. These findings may influence public debate and future policy at the national and international levels to improve air quality in cities and improve children’s health.","Ratajczak, Aleksandra; Badyda, Artur; Czechowski, Piotr Oskar; Czarnecki, Adam; Dubrawski, Michał; Feleszko, Wojciech",J Clin Med,479,22

We propose that both conditions arise because innate immune responses generated in the absence of effective adaptive immune responses lead to monocyte/macrophage activation that is amplified by the emergence of a pathogen-specific adaptive immune response skewed towards monocyte/macrophage activating activity by the immunomodulatory effects of cytokines produced during the innate response, particularly interleukin-18. In mycobacterial IRIS, that disease-enhancing immune response is dominated by a Th1 CD4(+) T cell response against mycobacterial antigens. By analogy, it is proposed that in severe COVID-19, amplification of monocyte/macrophage activation results from the effects of a SARS-CoV-2 spike protein antibody response with pro-inflammatory characteristics, including high proportions of IgG3 and IgA2 antibodies and afucosylation of IgG1 antibodies, that arises from B cell differentiation in an extra-follicular pathway promoted by activation of mucosa-associated invariant T cells. We suggest that therapy for the hyperinflammation underlying both COVID-19 and mycobacterial IRIS might be improved by targeting the immunomodulatory as well as the pro-inflammatory effects of the ‘cytokine storm’.","Seddiki, Nabila; French, Martyn",Front Immunol,479,15

Inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine has been mainly used in Indonesia to induce HCWs antibody response against SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, information regarding the kinetics of antibody-induced by this vaccine remains scarce. Objective To investigate the magnitude and durability of antibodies against spike (S) protein (anti-S) after complete dose of vaccination among HCWs by using the electrochemiluminescence immunoassay. Results Seroconversion of anti-S antibodies was observed among 159 (99.4%) of 160 HCWs after 14 days of full-dose vaccination. The levels of anti-S antibodies significantly decreased after day 42 compared to day 14 post-vaccination, but it persisted up to 98 days following vaccination. In contrast, the vaccinated HCWs with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection had significantly higher and stably elevated anti-S antibodies concentrations than vaccinated HCWs without SARS-CoV-2 infection history. Conclusion The remarkable decline and lower anti-S antibodies concentration among infection-naïve HCWs potentially indicate the additional booster dose of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination may be required to ascertain COVID-19 protection among HCWs by this vaccine. This early study of antibody response induced by inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine among HCWs potentially contributes to the future policy decision regarding vaccination.","Cucunawangsih, Cucunawangsih; Wijaya, Ratna Sari; Lugito, Nata Pratama Hardjo; Suriapranata, Ivet",Int J Infect Dis,479,20

Three scales were used to determine adolescents’ TA awareness, attitude, and behavior. The results of the dual-moderated mediation model show that gender and duration of technology use (h) moderated the full mediation of attitude on awareness and behavior in TA (F = 39.29, df = 9;372, p < .01). The indirect effect in males with 16.04 h per day of technology use is stronger (.24) than the indirect effect in males with 4.90 h per day of technology use (.13).

RT-PCR requires highly specialized, expensive, and advanced bulky equipment that is difficult to use in the field or in a point of care setting. There is need for a simpler, inexpensive, convenient, portable and accurate test. Our aims were to: (i) design primer-probe pairs for use in isothermal amplification of the S1, ORF3 and ORF8 regions of the SARS-CoV2 virus; (ii) optimize the recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) assay for the isothermal amplification of the named SARS-COV2 regions; (iii) detect amplification products on a lateral flow device. and (ii) perform a pilot field validation of RPA on RNA extracted from nasopharyngeal swabs.

This study aimed to measure potential spatial access to COVID-19 vaccination centres in Mashhad, the second-most populous city in Iran. METHODS: The 2021 age structure of the urban census tracts was integrated into the enhanced two-step floating catchment area model to improve accuracy. The model was developed based on three different access scenarios: only public hospitals, only public healthcare centres and both (either hospitals or healthcare centres) as potential vaccination facilities. The weighted decision-matrix and analytic hierarchy process, based on four criteria (i.e. service area, accessibility index, capacity of vaccination centres and distance to main roads), were used to choose potential vaccination centres looking for the highest suitability for residents. Global Moran’s index (GMI) was used to measure the spatial autocorrelation of the accessibility index in different scenarios and the proposed model. RESULTS: There were 26 public hospitals and 271 public healthcare centres in the study area. Although the exclusive use of public healthcare centres for vaccination can provide the highest accessibility in the eastern and north-eastern parts of the study area, our findings indicate that including both public hospitals and public healthcare centres provide high accessibility to vaccination in central urban part. Therefore, a combination of public hospitals and public healthcare centres is recommended for efficient vaccination coverage. The value of GMI for the proposed model (accessibility to selected vaccination centres) was calculated as 0.53 (Z = 162.42, P < 0.01). Both GMI and Z-score values decreased in the proposed model, suggesting an enhancement in accessibility to COVID-19 vaccination services. CONCLUSIONS: The periphery and poor areas of the city had the least access to COVID-19 vaccination centres. Measuring spatial access to COVID-19 vaccination centres can provide valuable insights for urban public health decision-makers. Our model, coupled with geographical information systems, provides more efficient vaccination coverage by identifying the most suitable healthcare centres, which is of special importance when only few centres are available.

Specifically, individuals with a pre-existing mental health disorder seem more impaired by lockdown measures posing as major stress factors. Medical rehabilitation treatment can help people cope with these stressors. The internet and digital apps provide a platform to contribute to regular treatment and to conduct research on this topic. OBJECTIVE: Making use of internet-based assessments, this study investigated individuals from the general population and patients from medical, psychosomatic rehabilitation clinics. Levels of depression, anxiety, loneliness, and perceived stress during the COVID-19 pandemic, common COVID-19–related worries, and the intention to use digital apps were compared. Furthermore, we investigated whether participating in internet-delivered digital trainings prior to and during patients’ rehabilitation stay, as well as the perceived usefulness of digital trainings, were associated with improved mental health after rehabilitation. METHODS: A large-scale, online, cross-sectional study was conducted among a study sample taken from the general population (N=1812) in Germany from May 2020 to April 2021. Further, a longitudinal study was conducted making use of the internet among a second study sample of psychosomatic rehabilitation patients at two measurement time points—before (N=1719) and after (n=738) rehabilitation—between July 2020 and April 2021. Validated questionnaires and adapted items were used to assess mental health and COVID-19–related worries. Digital trainings were evaluated. Propensity score matching, multivariate analyses of covariance, an exploratory factor analysis, and hierarchical regression analyses were performed. RESULTS: Patients from the psychosomatic rehabilitation clinics reported increased symptoms with regard to depression, anxiety, loneliness, and stress (F(4,2028)=183.74, P<.001, η(2)(p)=0.27) compared to the general population. Patients perceived greater satisfaction in communication with health care professionals (F(1,837)=31.67, P<.001, η(2)(p)=0.04), had lower financial worries (F(1,837)=38.96, P<.001, η(2)(p)=0.04), but had higher household-related worries (F(1,837)=5.34, P=.02, η(2)(p)=0.01) compared to the general population. Symptoms of depression, anxiety, loneliness, and perceived stress were lower postrehabilitation (F(1,712)=23.21, P<.001, η(2)(p)=0.04) than prior to rehabilitation. Psychosomatic patients reported a higher intention to use common apps and digital trainings (F(3,2021)=51.41, P<.001, η(2)(p)=0.07) than the general population. With regard to digital trainings offered prior to and during the rehabilitation stay, the perceived usefulness of digital trainings on rehabilitation goals was associated with decreased symptoms of depression (β=–.14, P<.001), anxiety (β=–.12, P<.001), loneliness (β=–.18, P<.001), and stress postrehabilitation (β=–.19, P<.001). Participation in digital group therapy for depression was associated with an overall change in depression (F(1,725)=4.82, P=.03, η(2)(p)=0.01) and anxiety (F(1,725)=6.22, P=.01, η(2)(p)=0.01) from pre- to postrehabilitation. CONCLUSIONS: This study validated the increased mental health constraints of psychosomatic rehabilitation patients in comparison to the general population and the effects of rehabilitation treatment. Digital rehabilitation components are promising tools that could prepare patients for their rehabilitation stay, could integrate well with face-to-face therapy during rehabilitation treatment, and could support aftercare.

We systematically assessed these relationships. Unrestricted searches of the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were conducted, with an end date of May 9, 2020, to identify relevant studies that met predetermined inclusion criteria. Random-effects models were adopted to estimate the overall relative risk. Fourteen articles involving more than 19000 COVID-19 cases were included. Our results showed that ACEI/ARB exposure is not associated with a higher risk of COVID-19 infection (OR = 0.99; 95% CI, 0.95-1.04; P = 0.672). Among those with COVID-19 infection, ACEI/ARB exposure is not associated with a higher risk of severity (OR = 0.98; 95%CI 0.87-1.09; P = 0.69) or mortality (OR = 0.73, 95%CI 0.5-1.07; P = 0.111). However, ACEI/ARB exposure was associated with a lower risk of mortality compared those with non-ACEI/ARB antihypertensive drugs (OR = 0.48, 95% CI 0.29-0.81; P = 0.006). In conclusion, current evidence did not confirm previous concern regarding a harmful role of ACEI/ARB in COVID-19 patients.

As patients entering a doctor’s practice can potentially infect medical staff and other patients, using digital alternatives wherever possible is a potential solution to avoiding face-to-face encounters. In these conditions, telemedicine is becoming increasingly relevant. Hence, the aim of this study was to examine telemedicine use and gathered experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic in Austria. Materials and Methods: In June 2020, a representative group of Austrian respondents (n = 1000) was asked via online survey whether they had contacted a doctor during spring of 2020, and, if so, whether they had used a telemedical method to do so. The survey also reflected gathered experiences and degrees of satisfaction with the use of telemedicine. Results: A third (33%) of those who contacted a doctor during the target period did so using telemedical tools. The majority of those with previous telehealth experience were satisfied with the help they received. Patients commonly used a telephone to contact their doctors. The overall assessment of telemedical aids tended to be positive, with more than half (53%) of those surveyed seeing significant advantages, and a 90% satisfaction rate among the respondents who used telehealth services. Conclusion: The outcomes from this work hint at fairly high acceptance of telemedical communication tools in the studied group of the Austrian population. Based on the high rate of satisfaction among patients who used telehealth, it is expected that the use of telehealth services will increase further in the near future.","Kletečka-Pulker, Maria; Völkl-Kernstock, Sabine; Fassl, Anna; Klager, Elisabeth; Willschke, Harald; Klomfar, Sophie; Wochele-Thoma, Thomas; Schaden, Eva; Atanasov, Atanas G.",Healthcare (Basel),479,30

We aimed to determine whether the COVID-19 pandemic changed patient response, hospital treatment and mortality from AMI. METHODS AND RESULTS: Admission were classified as non ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) or STEMI at 99 hospitals in England through live feeding from the Myocardial Ischaemia National Audit Project between 1(st) January, 2019 and 22(nd) May, 2020. Time series plots were estimated using a 7-day simple moving average, adjusted for seasonality. From 23(rd) March, 2020 (UK lockdown) median daily hospitalisations decreased more for NSTEMI (69 to 35; IRR 0.51, 95% CI 0.47-0.54) than STEMI (35 to 25; IRR 0.74, 95% CI 0.69-0.80) to a nadir on 19th April, 2020. During lockdown, patients were younger (mean age 68.7 years vs. 66.9 years), less frequently diabetic (24.6% vs. 28.1%) or had cerebrovascular disease (7.0% vs. 8.6%). STEMI more frequently received primary PCI (81.8% vs 78.8%%), thrombolysis was negligible (0.5% vs. 0.3%), median admission-to-coronary angiography duration for NSTEMI decreased (26.2 vs. 64.0 hours), median duration of hospitalisation decreased (4 to 2 days), secondary prevention pharmacotherapy prescription remained unchanged (each >94.7%). Mortality at 30 days increased for NSTEMI (from 5.4% to 7.5%; OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.08-1.80), but decreased for STEMI (from 10.2% to 7.7%; OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.54-0.97). CONCLUSIONS: During COVID-19, there was a substantial decline in admissions with AMI. Those who presented to hospital were younger, less co-morbid and, for NSTEMI, had higher 30-day mortality.","Wu, Jianhua; Mamas, Mamas; Rashid, Muhammad; Weston, Clive; Hains, Julian; Luescher, Tom; de Belder, Mark A; Deanfield, John E; Gale, Chris P",Eur Heart J Qual Care Clin Outcomes,479,9

STR and SNP genotyping analysis provides data regarding the genetic and geographical ancestry of the populations studied. This study focused on the analysis of the Y-chromosome in Maronite Cypriots and Armenian Cypriots, who came to the island as a result of different historical events. The aim was to provide information on the paternal genetic ancestry of Maronites and Armenians of Cyprus and investigate any affinity with the Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots of the island. Since there is limited information in the current literature, we proceeded and used 23 Y-chromosome STRs and 28 Y-chromosome SNPs to genotype 57 Maronite Cypriots and 56 Armenian Cypriots, which were then compared to data from 344 Greek Cypriots and 380 Turkish Cypriots. All samples were assigned to eight major Y-haplogroups but the most frequent haplogroup among all Cypriots is haplogroup J in the major subclade J2a-L559. The calculated pairwise genetic distances between the populations show that Armenian Cypriots are genetically closer to Greek and Turkish Cypriots compared to Maronite Cypriots. Median Joining Network analysis in 17 Y-STR haplotypes of all Cypriots assigned to J2a-L559, revealed that Cypriots share a common paternal ancestor, prior to the migration of the Armenians and Maronites to Cyprus, estimated in the Late Bronze Age and Early Iron Age.","Moutsouri, Irene; Keravnou, Anna; Manoli, Panayiotis; Bertoncini, Stefania; Michailidou, Kyriaki; Christofi, Vasilis; Xenophontos, Stavroulla; Cariolou, Marios A.; Bashiardes, Evy",PLoS One,479,20

The present investigation summarizes the clinical characteristics and early prognosis of COVID-19 infection in a cohort of patients with fractures. METHODS: Data on 10 patients with a fracture and COVID-19 were collected from 8 different hospitals located in the Hubei province from January 1, 2020, to February 27, 2020. Analyses of early prognosis were based on clinical outcomes and trends in laboratory results during treatment. RESULTS: All 10 patients presented with limited activity related to the fracture. The most common signs were fever, cough, and fatigue at the time of presentation (7 patients each). Other, less common signs included sore throat (4 patients), dyspnea (5 patients), chest pain (1 patient), nasal congestion (1 patient), headache (1 patient), dizziness (3 patients), abdominal pain (1 patient), and vomiting (1 patient). Lymphopenia (<1.0 × 10(9) cells/L) was identified in 6 of 10 patients, 9 of 9 patients had a high serum level of D-dimer, and 9 of 9 patients had a high level of C-reactive protein. Three patients underwent surgery, whereas the others were managed nonoperatively because of their compromised status. Four patients died on day 8 (3 patients) or day 14 (1 patient) after admission. The clinical outcomes for the surviving patients are not yet determined. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical characteristics and early prognosis of COVID-19 in patients with fracture tended to be more severe than those reported for adult patients with COVID-19 without fracture. This finding may be related to the duration between the development of symptoms and presentation.

There is currently no approved therapeutics for treating COVID-19. The SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein is considered a key therapeutic target by many researchers. Here we describe the identification of several monoclonal antibodies that target SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. One human antibody, CA521(FALA), demonstrated neutralization potential by immunizing human antibody transgenic mice. CA521(FALA) showed potent SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralization activity against SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus and authentic SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro. CA521(FALA) also demonstrated having a long half-life of 9.5 days in mice and 9.3 days in rhesus monkeys. CA521(FALA) inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection in SARS-CoV-2 susceptible mice at a therapeutic setting with virus titer of the lung reduced by 4.5 logs. Structural analysis by cryo-EM revealed that CA521(FALA) recognizes an epitope overlapping with angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)-binding sites in SARS-CoV-2 RBD in the Spike protein. CA521(FALA) blocks the interaction by binding all three RBDs of one SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer simultaneously. These results demonstrate the importance for antibody-based therapeutic interventions against COVID-19 and identifies CA521(FALA) a promising antibody that reacts with SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein to strongly neutralize its activity.","Song, Deyong; Wang, Wenbo; Dong, Chuangchuang; Ning, Zhenfei; Liu, Xiu; Liu, Chuan; Du, Guangying; Sha, Chunjie; Wang, Kailin; Lu, Jun; Sun, Baiping; Zhao, Yanyan; Wang, Qiaoping; Xu, Hongguang; Li, Ying; Shen, Zhenduo; Jiao, Jie; Wang, Ruiying; Tian, Jingwei; Liu, Wanhui; Wang, Lan; Deng, Yong-Qiang; Dou, Changlin",Commun Biol,479,1

A better understanding of antibiotic therapy in COVID-19 is necessary. METHODS: 6457 SARS-CoV-2-infected cases, documented from March 18, 2020, until February 16, 2021, in the LEOSS cohort were analyzed. As primary endpoint, the correlation between any antibiotic treatment and all-cause mortality/progression to the next more advanced phase of disease was calculated for adult patients in the complicated phase of disease and procalcitonin (PCT) ≤ 0.5 ng/ml. The analysis took the confounders gender, age, and comorbidities into account. RESULTS: Three thousand, six hundred twenty-seven cases matched all inclusion criteria for analyses. For the primary endpoint, antibiotic treatment was not correlated with lower all-cause mortality or progression to the next more advanced (critical) phase (n = 996) (both p > 0.05). For the secondary endpoints, patients in the uncomplicated phase (n = 1195), regardless of PCT level, had no lower all-cause mortality and did not progress less to the next more advanced (complicated) phase when treated with antibiotics (p > 0.05). Patients in the complicated phase with PCT > 0.5 ng/ml and antibiotic treatment (n = 286) had a significantly increased all-cause mortality (p = 0.029) but no significantly different probability of progression to the critical phase (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: In this cohort, antibiotics in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients were not associated with positive effects on all-cause mortality or disease progression. Additional studies are needed.

It is spread from human to human and has resulted in a global pandemic, posing a disastrous public health risk worldwide. Patients with chronic kidney disease, especially those on dialysis, are considered to be at higher risk of developing severe COVID-19 due to their immunocompromised status and frail condition. The home treatment setting of peritoneal dialysis (PD) has advantages in terms of implementing self-care when routine hospital visits and social activities are restricted, thus greatly reducing exposure of PD patients to the virus. METHODS AND RESULTS: We outline general operational considerations in PD management during the COVID-19 pandemic, including precautionary measures for PD patients and healthcare staff. Precautionary measures for PD patients include education on prevention of, and screening for, COVID-19, preclinic screening, in-clinic management, meticulous remote patient management and special hospitalization arrangements. The diagnosis and treatment of PD patients with COVID-19 are discussed. Precautionary measures for PD staff include continuous education on, and training in, COVID-19, exposure history surveillance and self-monitoring for COVID-19 among healthcare personnel, appropriate personal protective equipment and hand hygiene, organization of medical activities and staffing, and adequate environment cleaning. CONCLUSIONS: This is a battle of the entire human society against the novel coronavirus. Integrated teamwork among healthcare providers, supported by society as a whole, is needed as part of the ongoing public health response to try to slow the spread of COVID-19.","Yang, Zhikai; Dong, Jie",Clin Kidney J,479,1

The resulting data provide a rare opportunity to measure key metrics of disease course, transmission, and the impact of control. Methods The Shenzhen CDC identified 391 SARS-CoV-2 cases from January 14 to February 12, 2020 and 1286 close contacts. We compare cases identified through symptomatic surveillance and contact tracing, and estimate the time from symptom onset to confirmation, isolation, and hospitalization. We estimate metrics of disease transmission and analyze factors influencing transmission risk. Findings Cases were older than the general population (mean age 45) and balanced between males (187) and females (204). Ninety-one percent had mild or moderate clinical severity at initial assessment. Three have died, 225 have recovered (median time to recovery is 21 days). Cases were isolated on average 4.6 days after developing symptoms; contact tracing reduced this by 1.9 days. Household contacts and those travelling with a case where at higher risk of infection (ORs 6 and 7) than other close contacts. The household secondary attack rate was 15%, and children were as likely to be infected as adults. The observed reproductive number was 0.4, with a mean serial interval of 6.3 days. Interpretation Our data on cases as well as their infected and uninfected close contacts provide key insights into SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology. This work shows that heightened surveillance and isolation, particularly contact tracing, reduces the time cases are infectious in the community, thereby reducing R. Its overall impact, however, is uncertain and highly dependent on the number of asymptomatic cases. We further show that children are at similar risk of infection as the general population, though less likely to have severe symptoms; hence should be considered in analyses of transmission and control.","Bi, Qifang; Wu, Yongsheng; Mei, Shujiang; Ye, Chenfei; Zou, Xuan; Zhang, Zhen; Liu, Xiaojian; Wei, Lan; Truelove, Shaun A; Zhang, Tong; Gao, Wei; Cheng, Cong; Tang, Xiujuan; Wu, Xiaoliang; Wu, Yu; Sun, Binbin; Huang, Suli; Sun, Yu; Zhang, Juncen; Ma, Ting; Lessler, Justin; Feng, Teijian",,479,16

Methods: Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, imaging, treatment, and outcome data of patients were collected. Follow-up lasted until April 6, 2020. Results: All 55 patients included 47 (85.5%) non-severe patients and 8 (14.5%) severe patients. Common comorbidities were hypertension and diabetes. Common symptoms were fever, cough and sputum. Lymphopenia was a common laboratory finding, and ground-glass opacity was a common chest CT feature. All patients received antiviral therapy of α-interferon inhalation and lopinavir-ritonavir tablets. Common complications included acute liver injury and respiratory failure. All patients were discharged. No death was occurred and no medical staff got infected. Patients with severe COVID-19 showed significantly older age, decreased lymphocytes, increased C reactive protein, and higher frequency of bilateral lung infiltration compared to non-severe patients. Significantly more treatments including antibiotic therapy and mechanical ventilation, longer hospitalization stay and higher cost were shown on severe patients. Conclusions: Our study suggested that patients with severe COVID-19 may be more likely to have an older age, present with lymphopenia and bilateral lung infiltration, receive multiple treatments and stay longer in hospital.","Jiang, Xiufeng; Tao, Jianxin; Wu, Hui; Wang, Yixin; Zhao, Wei; Zhou, Min; Huang, Jiehui; You, Qian; Meng, Hua; Zhu, Feng; Zhang, Xiaoqing; Qian, Meifang; Qiu, Yuanwang",,479,20

It also leads to substantial unintended impacts when introduced species become invasive, causing environmental disturbance or transmitting diseases that affect people, livestock, other wildlife or the environment. Policy responses are usually only implemented after these species become established and damages are already incurred. International agreements to control trade are likewise usually based on selection of species with known impacts. We aim to further develop quantitative invasive species risk assessment for bird imports and extend the tool to explicitly address disease threats. LOCATION: United States of America. METHODS: We use a two‐step approach for rapid risk assessment based on the expected biological risks due to both the environmental and health impact of a potentially invasive wildlife species in trade. We assess establishment probability based on a model informed by historical observations and then construct a model of emerging infectious disease threat based on economic and ecological characteristics of the exporting country. RESULTS: We illustrate how our rapid assessment tool can be used to identify high‐priority species for regulation based on a combination of the threat they pose for becoming established and vectoring emerging infectious diseases. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Our approach can be executed for a species in a matter of days and is nested in an economic decision‐making framework for determining whether the biological risk is justified by trade benefits.","Springborn, Michael R.; Keller, Reuben P.; Elwood, Sarah; Romagosa, Christina M.; Zambrana‐Torrelio, Carlos; Daszak, Peter",Divers Distrib,479,11

The gender dimension of COVID-19 has attracted the attention of researchers and policymakers: while women seem to be less severely hit by the virus and are more compliant with the restricting rules imposed to reduce the spread of the contagion, they risk to suffer more the economic consequences of the pandemic, because they are more vulnerable on the labor market and because they are carrying on most of the burden of housework and childcare which increased substantially during the lockdown. Public policies are required to address the emergency and to deal with its gender implications. Anecdotal evidence suggests that women leaders have performed better than men in dealing with the emergency. This paper explores the evidence on the gender dimension of the pandemic under a new perspective proposed by Profeta (2020), focused on the double relationship between gender equality and public policy: on one side, I show which policies can support gender equality in times of COVID-19 and, on the other side, I explore whether women leadership can promote successful measures.

A mobile phone app‐based survey was conducted among registered nurses in Jiangsu province via a region‐stratified sampling method. The questionnaire consisted of items on the demographic characteristics of the nursing staff and their Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale‐21 (DASS‐21) along with questions for self‐assessment of stressors that are associated with COVID‐19. STROBE guideline was used. Among 1803 nurses who were working in the low‐risk areas in Jiangsu, 22.0%, 29.8%, and 16.1% of them reported moderate to extreme levels of depression, anxiety, and stress, respectively. Having 11–15 years of working experience and being a fixed‐term contract nurse were associated with experiencing worse mental health outcomes while supporting‐Wuhan working experience and having mental health preparation course training were independent factors that had beneficial impact on their psychological well‐being afterward. In terms of source of pressure, a key finding of this study is that the main stressor among these nurses was the lack of patient’s understanding and cooperation (71.2%) which calls for better psychosocial communication between nurses and patients. The present findings would provide information for other regions at low risk of COVID‐19 and may aid the provision of support and interventions for the benefit of the psychological well‐being of nurses who are exposed to life‐threatening occupational risks and are more vulnerable to the pandemic than others.","Chen, Xian; Arber, Anne; Gao, Junyu; Zhang, Li; Ji, Meili; Wang, Dan; Wu, Jinfeng; Du, Junjie",Int J Ment Health Nurs,479,20

Polymorphism of MBL and MASP-2 genes may affect the serum concentration of MBL and MASP-2. This study explores the association between MBL and MASP-2 gene polymorphism and their interactions and the susceptibility to tuberculosis (TB). METHOD: A total of 503 patients with TB and 419 healthy controls were recruited to participate in this case-control study. PCR-SSP technology was applied to genotype rs7096206 of MBL genes and rs2273346 and rs6695096 of MASP-2 genes. Demographic data and some exposure information were also obtained from study participants. Unconditional logistic regression analysis was used to identify association between the various factors and TB whilst Marginal Structural Linear Odds Models were used to estimate the interactions. RESULTS: Both genotype GC at rs7096206 of MBL genes and genotype TC at rs2273346 and rs6695096 of MASP-2 genes were more prevalent in the TB patient group than the healthy control group (P < 0.05, OR 1.393, 1.302 and 1.426 respectively). The relative excess risk of interaction (RERI) between rs7096206 of MBL genes and rs2273346 and rs6695096 of MASP-2 genes was 0.897 (95% CI: 0.282, 1.513) and 1.142 (95% CI: 0.755, 1.530) respectively (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Polymorphisms of MBL (rs7096206) and MASP-2 (rs2273346 and rs6695096) were associated with the susceptibility of TB, and there were gene-gene interactions among them.","Chen, Mengshi; Liang, Ying; Li, Wufei; Wang, Mian; Hu, Li; Abuaku, Benjamin Kwaku; Huang, Xin; Tan, Hongzhuan; Wen, Shi Wu",BMC Infect Dis,479,1

The factors which determine the characteristics of VLP monomers assembly are provided in detail. Analysis of the literature demonstrates that the development of the techniques of VLP production and immobilization of target antigens on their surface have led to the development of universal platforms which make it possible for virtually any known antigen to be exposed on the particle surface in a highly concentrated form. As a result, the focus of attention has shifted from the approaches to VLP production to the development of a precise interface between the organism’s immune system and the peptides inducing a strong immune response to pathogens or the organism’s own pathological cells.

While early cases of the disease were linked to a wet market, human-to-human transmission has driven the rapid spread of the virus throughout China. The Chinese government has implemented containment strategies of city-wide lockdowns, screening at airports and train stations, and isolation of suspected patients; however, the cumulative case count keeps growing every day. The ongoing outbreak presents a challenge for modelers, as limited data are available on the early growth trajectory, and the epidemiological characteristics of the novel coronavirus are yet to be fully elucidated. We use phenomenological models that have been validated during previous outbreaks to generate and assess short-term forecasts of the cumulative number of confirmed reported cases in Hubei province, the epicenter of the epidemic, and for the overall trajectory in China, excluding the province of Hubei. We collect daily reported cumulative confirmed cases for the 2019-nCoV outbreak for each Chinese province from the National Health Commission of China. Here, we provide 5, 10, and 15 day forecasts for five consecutive days, February 5th through February 9th, with quantified uncertainty based on a generalized logistic growth model, the Richards growth model, and a sub-epidemic wave model. Our most recent forecasts reported here, based on data up until February 9, 2020, largely agree across the three models presented and suggest an average range of 7409–7496 additional confirmed cases in Hubei and 1128–1929 additional cases in other provinces within the next five days. Models also predict an average total cumulative case count between 37,415 and 38,028 in Hubei and 11,588–13,499 in other provinces by February 24, 2020. Mean estimates and uncertainty bounds for both Hubei and other provinces have remained relatively stable in the last three reporting dates (February 7th – 9th). We also observe that each of the models predicts that the epidemic has reached saturation in both Hubei and other provinces. Our findings suggest that the containment strategies implemented in China are successfully reducing transmission and that the epidemic growth has slowed in recent days.","Roosa, K.; Lee, Y.; Luo, R.; Kirpich, A.; Rothenberg, R.; Hyman, J.M.; Yan, P.; Chowell, G.",Infect Dis Model,479,16

This study analysed the spatiotemporal patterns and clusters of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases reported in Saudi Arabia between June 2012 and March 2019. Temporal, seasonal, spatial and spatiotemporal cluster analyses were performed using Kulldorff’s spatial scan statistics to determine the time period and geographical areas with the highest MERS-CoV infection risk. A strongly significant temporal cluster for MERS-CoV infection risk was identified between April 5 and May 24, 2014. Most MERS-CoV infections occurred during the spring season (41.88%), with April and May showing significant seasonal clusters. Wadi Addawasir showed a high-risk spatial cluster for MERS-CoV infection.

It is very rarely centred on the temporomandibular joint (TMJ). Fungi cause NOE in approximately 5–20% of patients, and a high index of suspicion is required for diagnosis, particularly when there is no improvement with prolonged topical and intravenous antibiotic therapy. OBJECTIVE: To report a novel case of fungal NOE centred on the left TMJ in an immunocompromised adult male with a focus on investigations and optimal management. Case Report. A 67-year-old male with comorbid chronic renal impairment presented to our otolaryngology department with prolonged left otalgia and otorrhoea. Subsequent cross-sectional imaging demonstrated left NOE centred on the TMJ. Poor resolution with prolonged courses of systemic and topical anti-pseudomonal antibiotics prompted maxillofacial surgical input for left TMJ exploration, washout, and biopsy from the joint capsule. The causative organism was identified as Aspergillus flavus on PCR analysis. The patient was successfully treated with oral posaconazole and repeated topical insertions of amphotericin B-soaked ribbon gauze to the left ear. Discussion. A combination of various imaging modalities including CT, MRI, Tc-99, and gallium-67 are utilised in clinical practice both to diagnose NOE and subsequently monitor disease progression or resolution. Immunocompromised patients with confirmed fungal NOE may require a combination of treatments including surgical debridement and prolonged antifungal therapy for a number of months, if not lifelong, treatment. Initiating empirical antifungal therapy may be justified in some patients. However, this should be judged on a case-by-case basis and guided by discussion with the local microbiology and infectious diseases departments. However, there is no national guideline or consensus regarding treatment of these patients, especially in cases of fungal NOE.","Khan, A.; Omakobia, E.; Hasnie, S.; Barton, R.; Gopalan, P.; Oktseloglou, V.; Smith, I.",Case Rep Otolaryngol,479,23

Despite the medical importance of this disease, some crucial steps in the development of encephalitis remain poorly understood. In particular, the basis of the disease severity is largely unknown. METHODS: TBE virus growth, neutralizing antibody response, key cytokine and chemokine mRNA production and changes in mRNA levels of cell surface markers of immunocompetent cells in brain were measured in mice with different susceptibilities to TBE virus infection. RESULTS: An animal model of TBE based on BALB/c-c-STS/A (CcS/Dem) recombinant congenic mouse strains showing different severities of the infection in relation to the host genetic background was developed. After subcutaneous inoculation of TBE virus, BALB/c mice showed medium susceptibility to the infection, STS mice were resistant, and CcS-11 mice were highly susceptible. The resistant STS mice showed lower and delayed viremia, lower virus production in the brain and low cytokine/chemokine mRNA production, but had a strong neutralizing antibody response. The most sensitive strain (CcS-11) failed in production of neutralizing antibodies, but exhibited strong cytokine/chemokine mRNA production in the brain. After intracerebral inoculation, all mouse strains were sensitive to the infection and had similar virus production in the brain, but STS mice survived significantly longer than CcS-11 mice. These two strains also differed in the expression of key cytokines/chemokines, particularly interferon gamma-induced protein 10 (IP-10/CXCL10) and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1/CCL2) in the brain. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that the genetic control is an important factor influencing the clinical course of TBE. High neutralizing antibody response might be crucial for preventing host fatality, but high expression of various cytokines/chemokines during TBE can mediate immunopathology and be associated with more severe course of the infection and increased fatality.","Palus, Martin; Vojtíšková, Jarmila; Salát, Jiří; Kopecký, Jan; Grubhoffer, Libor; Lipoldová, Marie; Demant, Peter; Růžek, Daniel",J Neuroinflammation,479,0

Besides being highly versatile due to multiplex capabilities, the assay was highly specific and sensitive and adaptable to measuring both total antibodies and antibody isotypes. While determining the assay performance characteristics, we were able to identify antibody production patterns (e.g., kinetics of isotypes, individual variations) for total antibodies and individual antibody classes.

RESULTS: We observed an important reduction in elective and urgent interventions compared to the same period of the previous year; in parallel, we observed an increase in the diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in hospitalized patients, especially with severe infection. In our department, four infections were reported among health workers. CONCLUSIONS: The impact of the COVID19 pandemic on health-care delivery has been massive. A wave of vascular-related complications is expected. Regular SARS-CoV-2 screening, adequate protection, and quick reorganization of health-care resources are still needed.","Bozzani, Antonio; Pallini, Maura; Arici, Vittorio; Tavazzi, Guido; Ticozzelli, Giulia; Franciscone, Mila Maria; Danesino, Vittorio; Mojoli, Francesco; Ragni, Franco; Sterpetti, Antonio V.",Ann Vasc Surg,479,13

Objective We aimed to assess how mutations in RBD affected recognition of immune sera by antibodies induced by natural infection versus immunization with BNT162b2, a mRNA-based vaccine against COVID-19. Methods We produced SARS-CoV-2 RBD mutants with single mutations in the receptor binding domain (RBD) region (E484K, K417N, N501Y) or with all 3 mutations combined, as occurring in the newly emerged variants B.1.351 (South Africa) and P.1 (Brazil). Using standard and avidity ELISAs, we determined the binding capacities to mutant RBDs of antibodies induced by infection versus vaccination. Results These binding assays showed that vaccination induced antibodies recognize both wildtype and mutant RBDs with higher avidities than those raised by infection. Nevertheless, recognition of mutants RBDK417N and RBDN501Y was 2.5-3-fold reduced while RBDE484K and the triple mutant were 10-fold less well recognized, demonstrating that the mutation at position 484 was key for the observed loss in cross-reactivity. Conclusion Our binding data demonstrate improved recognition of mutant viruses by BNT162b2-induced antibodies compared to those induced by natural infection. Recognition may, however, be 10-fold reduced for the variants B.1.351/P.1, suggesting that the development of a new vaccine is warranted. The E484K mutation is an key hurdle for immune recognition, convalescent plasma and monoclonal antibody therapy as well as serological assays based on the wildtype sequence may therefore seriously impaired.

This pandemic has become a disaster since the spreading rate from person to person is incredibly high and many techniques have come forth to aid in stopping the infection. Although various types of methods have been put into implementation, the search and suggestions of new approaches to reduce the increasing rate of infection will never come to an end until a vaccine terminates this pandemic. This study focuses on proposing a new framework that is based on Deep Learning algorithms for recognizing the COVID-19 cases, mostly in public places. The algorithms include Background Subtraction for extracting the foreground of thermal images from thermal videos generated by Thermal Cameras through the Thermal Imaging process and the Convolutional Neural Network for detecting people infected with the virus. This automated prototype works in a real-time scenario that helps identify people with the disease and will try to trace it while separating them from having any other contact. This proposal intends to achieve a satisfying growth in determining the real cases of COVID-19 and minimize the spreading rate of this virus to the max, ultimately avoiding more deaths.","Peddinti, Bharati; Shaikh, Amir; K.R., Bhavya; K.C., Nithin Kumar",Biomed Signal Process Control,479,23

Faced with this threat and no effective treatment, most countries adopted some form of enforced social distancing (lockdown) to reduce transmission - in most cases successfully reducing the reproductive number,R, below one. However, given the large pool of susceptible individuals that remain, complete relaxation of controls is likely to generate a substantial second wave. Vaccination remains the only foreseeable means of both containing the infection and returning to normal interactions and behaviour. Here, we consider the optimal targeting of vaccination with the aim of minimising future deaths or quality adjusted life year (QALY) losses. We show that, for a range of assumptions on the action and efficacy of the vaccine, targeting older age groups first is optimal and can avoid a second wave if the vaccine prevents transmission as well as disease.","Moore, S.; Hill, E.

Mathematics and statistics are still at the cutting edge of technology where scientific experts, health facilities, and government deal with infection and disease transmission issues. The model has implicitly applied to COVID-19, a transmittable disease by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The SIR model (Susceptible-Infection-Recovered) used as a context for examining the nature of the pandemic. Though, some of the mathematical model assumptions have been improved evaluation of the contamination-free from excessive predictions. The objective of this study is to provide a simple but effective explanatory model for the prediction of the future development of infection and for checking the effectiveness of containment and lock-down. We proposed a SIR model with a flattening curve and herd immunity based on a susceptible population that grows over time and difference in mortality and birth rates. It illustrates how a disease behaves over time, taking variables such as the number of sensitive individuals in the community and the number of those who are immune. It accurately model the disease and their lessons on the importance of immunization and herd immunity.

We aimed to assess the experience of patients with IBD during the COVID-19 lockdown. DESIGN: We designed a survey focused on the impact of COVID-19 on IBD healthcare, social and psychological well-being and quality of life. To capture those most likely to be affected we targeted survey invitations at our British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) defined high and moderate-risk IBD population. Access to the survey was also available via our trust’s social media pages. RESULTS: 685 responses were received. 76% of respondents categorised themselves in BSG defined moderate or high-risk groups, requiring stringent social distancing or shielding. 87% did not change their IBD medication, with most reported changes initiated by the IBD team. 39% were worried about their IBD care, but most services were largely uninterrupted. 90% received ‘at-risk’ notification often from multiple sources, but 17% not until May. The majority reported a negative impact of COVID-19 on their quality of life and significantly increased perceived stress. Patients expressed a strong wish of having future care delivered remotely. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 has had a significant negative impact on psychological well-being of patients with IBD. Local IBD services must have a robust data set of vulnerable patients and be designated future responsibility for prompt communication of advice to avoid delayed and sometimes conflicting information. Remote patient management systems should be further developed and embedded in clinical practice.","Harris, Richard James; Downey, Louise; Smith, Trevor R; Cummings, J R Fraser; Felwick, Richard; Gwiggner, Markus",BMJ Open Gastroenterol,479,24

Understanding the interaction between mycoviruses and plant pathogenic fungi is necessary for preventing damage caused by F. graminearum. Therefore, we investigated important cellular regulatory processes in a host containing FgV1-DK21 as compared to an uninfected parent using a transcriptional approach. RESULTS: Using a 3′-tiling microarray covering all known F. graminearum genes, we carried out genome-wide expression analyses of F. graminearum at two different time points. At the early point of growth of an infected strain as compared to an uninfected strain, genes associated with protein synthesis, including ribosome assembly, nucleolus, and ribosomal RNA processing, were significantly up-regulated. In addition, genes required for transcription and signal transduction, including fungal-specific transcription factors and cAMP signaling, respectively, were actively up-regulated. In contrast, genes involved in various metabolic pathways, particularly in producing carboxylic acids, aromatic amino acids, nitrogen compounds, and polyamines, showed dramatic down-regulation at the early time point. Moreover, genes associated with transport systems localizing to transmembranes were down-regulated at both time points. CONCLUSION: This is the first report of global change in the prominent cellular pathways in the Fusarium host containing FgV1-DK21. The significant increase in transcripts for transcription and translation machinery in fungal host cells seems to be related to virus replication. In addition, significant down-regulation of genes required for metabolism and transporting systems in a fungal host containing the virus appears to be related to the host defense mechanism and fungal virulence. Taken together, our data aid in the understanding of how FgV1-DK21 regulates the transcriptional reprogramming of F. graminearum.","Cho, Won Kyong; Yu, Jisuk; Lee, Kyung-Mi; Son, Moonil; Min, Kyunghun; Lee, Yin-Won; Kim, Kook-Hyung",BMC Genomics,479,1

A Google(®) Forms Internet survey was completed by 1156 HCW. Of the people who wore face masks (three layers of surgical, cloth, respirators and half-face masks), 31.6% reported itch. Sensitive skin, atopic predisposition and facial dermatoses significantly predisposed users to the development of itch. The vast majority of subjects reported itch of moderate intensity. Itch in HCW may cause scratching and decrease the effectiveness of the necessary protection. The results indicate that face-mask-associated itch is an important problem, which should be addressed in future studies. The decreased protection may lead to the spread of the virus among health care workers and their shortage during the pandemic. ABSTRACT: Background: Face mask use has increased significantly due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Health care workers (HCW) wear masks for prolonged periods and are prone to adverse effects. Very little is known about face-mask-associated itch. Methods: This Internet survey study investigated the prevalence, intensity and clinical characteristics of itch related to the use of face masks by HCW during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results were subsequently compared to the students’ group. Results: A total of 1156 HCW completed the survey. Among them, 31.6% (365) reported suffering from itch associated with face mask use. Itch was more frequent among females. Moreover, subjects who reported sensitive skin, atopic predispositions and facial dermatoses tended to report itch more frequently. The worst case of itch in the seven days prior to the study, assessed with the numeric rating scale (NRS), was 4.6 ± 2.0 points. Itch prevalence increased along with the duration of face mask use, being 34.6% among those who wore masks for more than 4 h. HCW reported itch significantly more frequently than students. Conclusions: Face-mask-associated itch is a frequent problem among HCW in the COVID-19 pandemic. Itch sensation may cause scratching, which may decrease necessary protection during the pandemic.","Krajewski, Piotr K.; Matusiak, Łukasz; Szepietowska, Marta; Białynicki-Birula, Rafał; Szepietowski, Jacek C.",Biology (Basel),479,24

The Utah Department of Health (UDOH) analyzed COVID-19 surveillance data to describe workplace outbreaks by industry sectors. In this report, workplaces refer to non-health care, noncongregate-living, and noneducational settings. As of June 5, 2020, UDOH reported 277 COVID-19 outbreaks, 210 (76%) of which occurred in workplaces. Approximately 12% (1,389 of 11,448) of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Utah were associated with workplace outbreaks. The 210 workplace outbreaks occurred in 15 of 20 industry sectors;* nearly one half of all workplace outbreaks occurred in three sectors: Manufacturing (43; 20%), Construction (32; 15%) and Wholesale Trade (29; 14%); 58% (806 of 1,389) of workplace outbreak-associated cases occurred in these three sectors. Although 24% of Utah's workforce in all 15 affected sectors identified as Hispanic or Latino (Hispanic) or a race other than non-Hispanic white (nonwhite†) (1), 73% (970 of 1,335) of workplace outbreak-associated COVID-19 cases were in persons who identified as Hispanic or nonwhite. Systemic social inequities have resulted in the overrepresentation of Hispanic and nonwhite workers in frontline occupations where exposure to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, might be higher (2); extra vigilance in these sectors is needed to ensure prevention and mitigation strategies are applied equitably and effectively to workers of racial and ethnic groups disproportionately affected by COVID-19. Health departments can adapt workplace guidance to each industry sector affected by COVID-19 to account for different production processes and working conditions.","Bui, David P.; McCaffrey, Keegan; Friedrichs, Michael; LaCross, Nathan; Lewis, Nathaniel M.; Sage, Kylie; Barbeau, Bree; Vilven, Dede; Rose, Carolyn; Braby, Sara; Willardson, Sarah; Carter, Amy; Smoot, Christopher; Winquist, Andrea; Dunn, Angela",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,479,24

METHODS: Multiple databases were searched to identify articles on COVID-19. An unadjusted odds ratio (OR) was used to calculate the safety and efficacy of HCQ on a random effect model. RESULTS: Twelve studies comprising 3,912 patients (HCQ 2,512 and control 1400) were included. The odds of all-cause mortality (OR: 2.23, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.58 - 3.13, P value < 0.00001) were significantly higher in patients on HCQ compared to patients on control agent. The response to therapy assessed by negative repeat polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (OR: 1.83, 95% CI: 0.50 - 6.75, P = 0.36), radiological resolution (OR: 1.98, 95% CI: 0.47 - 8.36, P value = 0.36) and the need for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) (OR: 1.21, 95% CI: 0.34 - 4.33, P value = 0.76) were identical between the two groups. Overall, four times higher odds of net adverse events (NAEs) were observed in the HCQ group (OR: 4.59, 95% CI 1.73 - 12.20, P value = 0.02). The measures for individual safety endpoints were also numerically lower in the control arm; however, none of these values reached the level of statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: HCQ might offer no benefits in terms of decreasing the viral load and radiological improvement in patients with COVID-19. HCQ appears to be associated with higher odds of all-cause mortality and NAEs.","Ullah, Waqas; M.

A total of 74 patients were included in our study. Patients were divided into two groups. Patients with the COVID-19 group (n = 31), and individuals without a history of serious illness or infection used as the control group (n = 43). The serum concentrations of interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, IL-10, IL-21, and TNF-α were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Levels of serum vitamin D were detected with Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) methodologies. TNF-α, IL-1, IL-6, IL-10, IL-21, and vitamin D levels were measured in all patients. The serum cytokine levels in COVID-19 pateint group were significantly higher (151.59± 56.50, 140.37 ± 64.32, 249.02± 62.84, 129.04 ± 31.64, and 123.58 ± 24.49, respectively) from control groups. Serum vitamin D was also significantly low (6.82 ± 3.29) in patients with the COVID-19 group than the controls (21.96 ± 5.39). Regarding the correlation of vitamin D with cytokine levels, it was significantly variable. Our study shows that COVID-19 patients are associated with lower serum vitamin D and higher pro-inflammatory cytokines associated with increased virus presence. Our data provide more evidence of the anti-inflammatory effect of vitamin D on COVID-19 patients and the protective effects of vitamin D on risk have been demonstrated.

In February of 2014, PDCoV was detected in pigs with clinical diarrheal symptoms for the first time in the USA. Since then, it has been detected in more than 20 states in the USA and in other countries, including Canada, South Korea, and mainland China. So far, histological lesions in the intestines of pigs naturally infected with PDCoV under field conditions have not been reported. In this report, we describe the characteristic histological lesions in the small intestine that were associated with PDCoV infection, as evidenced by detection of viral nucleic acid by RT-PCR. In addition, we performed genomic analysis to determine the genetic relationship of all PDCoV strains from the four countries. We found that PDCoV mainly caused histological lesions in the small intestines of naturally infected piglets. Sequence analysis demonstrated that the PDCoV strains of different countries are closely related and shared high nucleotide sequence similarity; however, deletion patterns in the spike and 3’ untranslated regions are different among the strains from mainland China, Hong Kong, the USA, and South Korea. Our study highlights the fact that continual surveillance is needed to trace the evolution of this virus.","Wang, Leyi; Hayes, Jeff; Sarver, Craig; Byrum, Beverly; Zhang, Yan",Arch Virol,479,33

The spread of pandemic influenza A (A(H1N1)pdm09) in 2009 around the globe had a huge impact on global health. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of A(H1N1)pdm09 on pediatric ARI in Vietnam. STUDY DESIGN: An ongoing population-based prospective surveillance in central Vietnam was used. All children aged <15 years residing in Nha Trang city, enrolled to the ARI surveillance in Khanh Hoa General Hospital, from February 2007 through March 2011 were studied. Clinical data and nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected. Influenza A was detected and genotyped by multiplex polymerase chain reaction assays and sequencing. RESULTS: Among enrolled 2736 hospitalized ARI cases, 354 (13%) were positive for influenza A. Genotyping results revealed that seasonal H3N2 and H1N1 (sea-H1N1) viruses were cocirculating before A(H1N1)pdm09 appeared in July 2009. The A(H1N1)pdm09 replaced the sea-H1N1 after the pandemic. The majority of influenza A cases (90%) were aged <5 years with incidence rate of 537 (387–775) per 100 000 population. Annual incidence rates of hospitalized influenza cases for pre-, initial and post-pandemic periods among children aged <5 year were 474, 452, and 387 per 100 000, respectively. Children with A(H1N1)pdm09 were elder, visited the hospital earlier, less frequently had severe signs, and were less frequently associated with viral coinfection compared with seasonal influenza cases. CONCLUSIONS: The A(H1N1)pdm09 did not increase the influenza annual hospitalization incidence or disease severity compared with seasonal influenza among pediatric ARI cases in central Vietnam.","Le, Minh Nhat; Yoshida, Lay Myint; Suzuki, Motoi; Nguyen, Hien Anh; Le, Huu Tho; Moriuchi, Hiroyuki; Dang, Duc Anh; Ariyoshi, Koya",Influenza Other Respir Viruses,479,29

Caused by pathogens including bacteria, viruses, parasites, or fungi, they are known to pose serious health threats to the world's population dating back to ancient Egypt. In the 14th Century alone, infectious diseases were responsible for decimating 20–45% of the world's population. The discovery of vaccines, coupled with improved sanitation, hygiene, and health care, witnessed the eradication of several infectious diseases, although some have resurfaced or are resurfacing since the latter part of the 20th Century. While geography partly define hotspots for emerging and infectious diseases, low socioeconomic development, poverty, and underfunded health care systems remain driving forces for the reoccurrence of these diseases among vulnerable populations who experience material deprivation. To eradicate infectious diseases, a global response will have to prioritize the allocation of resources by way of expertise and technology to areas that are most affected. Furthermore, an effective surveillance system, and a rigorous vaccine deployment regime targeting vulnerable persons and regions is desirable in mitigating the impacts of these diseases.","Antabe, Roger; Ziegler, Bianca Rosa",International Encyclopedia of Human Geography,479,25

We studied the temporal dynamics and geographic distribution of SARS-CoV-2 subtypes in India. Moreover, we analysed the RGD motif and D614G mutation in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. We used a previously proposed viral subtyping method based upon informative subtype markers (ISMs). The ISMs were identified on the basis of information entropy using 94,515 genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 available publicly at the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID). We identified 11 distinct positions in the SARS-CoV-2 genomes for defining ISMs resulting in 798 unique ISMs. The most abundant ISM in India was transferred from European countries. In contrast, the second most abundant ISM in India was found to be transferred via Australia. Moreover, the eastern regions in India were infected by the ISM most abundant in China due to geographical linkage. Our analysis confirmed higher rates of new cases in the countries abundant with S-G614 strain compared to countries with abundant S-D614 strain. In India, overall S-G614 was most prevalent compared to S-D614, except a few regions including New Delhi, Bihar, and Rajasthan.","Mathur, Piyush; Goyal, Pratik; Verma, Garima; Yadav, Pankaj",Sci Rep,479,27

The main goal of this study is to show the non-trivial consequences of providing alternative food in a disease induced predator–prey system. Numerical simulation results illustrate that there exists a critical infection rate above which disease free system cannot be reached in absence of alternative food whereas supply of suitable alternative food makes the system disease free up to certain infection level.

Here we quantitatively evaluate use and potential of modern information and communication technology (ICT) in solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients. We conducted a structured, questionnaire-based, cross-sectional study that was addressed to patients after kidney, liver, pancreas, or combined transplantation. We focused on: sociodemographic data, present use of digital technologies in daily life and for health reasons, patients’ eHealth literacy, and their overall attitude towards eHealth. A total of 234 patients completed the questionnaire. Most of the patients (90%) have a web-enabled computer, 78.2% have a smartphone, and 71.8% regularly search the internet for health-related information. Sixty-eight percent would like to receive discharge summaries online, and 54% would like to chat online with their physicians. Even though ICT use in daily life was age-related, no significant difference could be shown for health reasons or the type of transplanted organ. Modern ICT use is predominantly accepted for health reasons by SOT recipients. Regardless of the transplanted organ, a deeper integration of eHealth has potential for improving cross-sectoral care. To successfully implement eHealth technologies in cross-sectoral care future research should include online physician–patient communication, data security, data safety, and the aspects of quality and safety of care.","Holderried, Martin; Hoeper, Ansgar; Holderried, Friederike; Heyne, Nils; Nadalin, Silvio; Unger, Oliver; Ernst, Christian; Guthoff, Martina",Sci Rep,479,22

The participants included nurses working in hospice care units in general hospitals in South Korea. Data collected from August 1 to 31, 2020 were analyzed using t-test, ANOVA, Pearson′s correlation coefficients, and hierarchical multiple regression. The performance of terminal care was positively correlated with attitudes toward nursing care of the dying (r = 0.45, p < 0.001) and nurses’ characteristics (r = 0.60, p < 0.001). There was also a positive correlation (r = 0.58, p < 0.001) between attitudes toward nursing care for dying patients and nurses′ characteristics. Nurses’ characteristics had a significant moderating effect on the relationship between attitudes toward nursing care of the dying and performance of terminal care. This means that the nurses’ character had a buffering effect on the relationship between attitudes toward nursing care of the dying and performance of terminal care in hospice care units. These findings suggest that continuous and repetitive educational programs on terminal care need to be enhanced, and strategies to strengthen attitudes toward nursing care of the dying and nurses’ character need to be included in these programs.","Seo, Kawoun",Healthcare (Basel),479,16

WNV infections are acutely controlled by innate immunity in peripheral tissues outside of the central nervous system (CNS) but WNV can evade the actions of interferon (IFN) to facilitate CNS invasion, causing encephalitis, encephalomyelitis, and death. Recent studies indicate that STimulator of INterferon Gene (STING), canonically known for initiating a type I IFN production and innate immune response to cytosolic DNA, is required for host defense against neurotropic RNA viruses. We evaluated the role of STING in host defense to control WNV infection and pathology in a murine model of infection. When challenged with WNV, STING knock out (-/-) mice displayed increased morbidity and mortality compared to wild type (WT) mice. Virologic analysis and assessment of STING activation revealed that STING signaling was not required for control of WNV in the spleen nor was WNV sufficient to mediate canonical STING activation in vitro. However, STING-/- mice exhibited a clear trend of increased viral load and virus dissemination in the CNS. We found that STING-/- mice exhibited increased and prolonged neurological signs compared to WT mice. Pathological examination revealed increased lesions, mononuclear cellular infiltration and neuronal death in the CNS of STING-/- mice, with sustained pathology after viral clearance. We found that STING was required in bone marrow derived macrophages for early control of WNV replication and innate immune activation. In vivo, STING-/- mice developed an aberrant T cell response in both the spleen and brain during WNV infection that linked with increased and sustained CNS pathology compared to WT mice. Our findings demonstrate that STING plays a critical role in immune programming for the control of neurotropic WNV infection and CNS disease.","McGuckin Wuertz, Kathryn; Treuting, Piper M.; Hemann, Emily A.; Esser-Nobis, Katharina; Snyder, Annelise G.; Graham, Jessica B.; Daniels, Brian P.; Wilkins, Courtney; Snyder, Jessica M.; Voss, Kathleen M.; Oberst, Andrew; Lund, Jennifer; Gale, Michael",PLoS Pathog,479,16

Rotavirus-specific IgM ASC occurred by post-inoculation day (PID) 3, and numbers peaked in spleen and MLN tissues by PID 7 and in intestinal LP by PID 7–14. Numbers of rotavirus specific IgA and IgG ASC in these tissues peaked at PID 14–21. Rotavirus specific IgA ASC were predominant in the gut and IgA to IgG rotavirus specific ASC ratios were highest for all rotavirus antigen coatings in the gut LP. However, the relative ratios of specific IgA to IgG ASC were lower (ratios of 5 to 7) against combined structural and nonstructural viral antigens (rotavirus-infected fixed cell ELISPOT plates) than ratios (13 to 46) against only viral structural antigens (rotavirus-coated ELISPOT plates), indicating that there were proportionately more specific IgG ASC to the nonstructural viral antigens in the LP, the tissue adjacent to the site of rotavirus replication in the intestine. In the node cells (spleen and MLN) rotavirus-specific IgA to IgG ASC ratios were lowest and against the various ELISPOT rotavirus coatings ranged from 0.7 to 4. Gnotobiotic piglets inoculated at different ages with porcine rotaviruses generally showed similar specific immunoglobulin (Ig) ASC responses to rotavirus infection, along with similar diarrhea and virus shedding patterns in the different age groups. However, the numbers of specific IgA ASC in the MLN of 3–4 week old pigs were higher than those of 3–5 day old pigs. Although challenge of SB1A or Gottfried rotavirus-inoculated pigs with SB1A (G4P7) or Gottfried (G4P6) rotavirus revealed a high degree of protection from diarrhea and virus shedding, greater numbers of specific IgM ASC were observed in spleen after challenge of SB1A-inoculated pigs with Gottfried rotavirus (same G type, distinct P type). Thus, by using the ELISPOT technique, we successfully measured intestinal mucosal antibody-related responses to rotavirus in gnotobiotic pigs. Moreover, our results support the use of gnotobiotic piglets as an animal model to evaluate active antibody responses and protection against rotavirus infection and disease.","Chen, Wei-Kang; Campbell, Thomas; VanCott, John; Saif, Linda J.",Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology,479,16

We describe a case of a middle-aged male with extensive acute lower limb ischemia and severe pneumonia related to COVID-19 infection. This case highlights the role of prophylactic anticoagulation in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection regardless of co-morbidities and D- dimer levels.","Ahsan, Tasnim; Rani, Bharta; Siddiqui, Roomana S; Lutfi, Irfan",Cureus,479,1

Since the emergence in Hubei province, China, during late 2019 the situation evolved to pandemic level. Following China, Europe was the second epicenter of the pandemic. To better comprehend the detailed founder mechanisms of the epidemic evolution in Central-Eastern Europe, particularly in Hungary, we determined the full-length SARS-CoV-2 genomes from 32 clinical samples collected from laboratory confirmed COVID-19 patients over the first month of disease in Hungary. We applied a haplotype network analysis on all available complete genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from GISAID database as of the 21th of April, 2020. We performed additional phylogenetic and phylogeographic analyses to achieve the recognition of multiple and parallel introductory events into our region. Here we present a publicly available network imaging of the worldwide haplotype relations of SARS-CoV-2 sequences and conclude the founder mechanisms of the outbreak in Central-Eastern Europe.","Kemenesi, Gabor; Zeghbib, Safia; Somogyi, Balazs; Toth, Gabor E; Banyai, Krisztian; Solymosi, Norbert; Szabo, Peter M; Szabo, Istvan; Balint, Adam; Urban, Peter; Herczeg, Robert; Gyenesei, Attila; Nagy, Agnes; Pereszlenyi, Csaba I; Babinszky, Gergely; Dudas, Gabor; Terhes, Gabriella; Zoldi, Viktor; Lovas, Robert; Tenczer, Szabolcs; Kornya, Laszlo; Jakab, Ferenc",bioRxiv,479,27

Although a strong psychological impact is possible, scant evidence is available to date. Past studies have shown that resilience decreases the negative effects of stress. This study aimed to examine depression, anxiety, and stress among the Italian general population during the phase characterized by lockdown, and to investigate the role of resilience as a potential predictor. METHODS: A total sample of 6,314 Italian people participated in this study. Participants were recruited between March 29 and May 04 2020 through an online survey. The Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-21 (DASS-21) and the Resilience Scale (RS) were administered. Demographic data and lockdown related information were also collected. A correlational analysis was carried out to examine relationships between psychopathological domains and resilience. Three hierarchical regression analyses were conducted using the depression, anxiety, and stress as dependent variables and the resilience as independent variable controlling for age, gender, and education. COVID-19 specific variables were also included in the three regression analyses. A further exploratory analysis was carried out to examine which aspects of resilience predict depression, anxiety, and stress. RESULTS: The prevalence of moderate to extremely severe symptoms among participants was 32% for depression, 24.4% for anxiety, and 31.7% for stress. The sample mean scores on depression, anxiety, and stress were higher than the normal scores reported in the literature. Results of correlational analysis showed that resilience factors, such as meaningfulness, self-reliance, existential aloneness, and equanimity, are inversely associated with depression, anxiety, and stress. Results of regression analyses indicated that resilience was statically significant in predicting depression, anxiety, and stress. Geographic area of residence and infected acquaintances were also significant predictors. Regarding the resilience factors, results revealed that meaningfulness, perseverance, and equanimity were statistically significant in predicting all the DASS-21 scales. CONCLUSION: About a third of respondents reported moderate to extremely severe depression, anxiety, and stress. The present study suggests that psychological resilience may independently contribute to low emotional distress and psychological ill-being. These findings can help explain the variability of individual responses during the COVID-19 outbreak.","Lenzo, Vittorio; Quattropani, Maria C.; Musetti, Alessandro; Zenesini, Corrado; Freda, Maria Francesca; Lemmo, Daniela; Vegni, Elena; Borghi, Lidia; Plazzi, Giuseppe; Castelnuovo, Gianluca; Cattivelli, Roberto; Saita, Emanuela; Franceschini, Christian",Front Psychol,479,12

COVID-19 disease severity shows variation depending on demographic characteristics like age, history of chronic illnesses such as cardio-vascular/renal/respiratory disease; pregnancy; immune-suppression; angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor medication use; NSAID use etc but the pattern of disease spread is uniform – human to human through contact, droplets and fomites. Up to 3.5% of health care workers treating COVID-19 contact an infection themselves with 14.8% of these infections severe and 0.3% fatal. The situation has spread panic even among health care professionals and the cry for safe patient care practices are resonated world-wide. Surgeons, anesthesiologists and intensivists who very frequently perform endotracheal intubation, tracheostomy, non-invasive ventilation and manual ventilation before intubation are at a higher odds ratio of 6.6, 4.2, 3.1 and 2.8 respectively of contacting an infection themselves. Elective surgery is almost always deferred in fever/infection scenarios. A surgeon and an anesthesiologist can anytime encounter a situation where in a COVID-19 patient requires an emergency surgery. COVID-19 cases requiring surgery predispose anesthesiologists and surgeons to cross-infection threats. This paper discusses, the COVID-19 precautionary outlines which has to be followed in the operating room; personal protective strategies available at present; methods to raise psychological preparedness of medical professionals during a pandemic; conduct of anesthesia in COVID-19 cases/suspect cases; methods of decontamination after conducting a surgery for COVID-19 case in the operating room; and post-exposure prophylaxis for medical professionals.","Suresh, Varun",J Indian Assoc Pediatr Surg,479,16

METHODS: In this cross‐sectional study, we recruited pregnant women and puerperal women who delivered between January and September 2020 in Japan, using an online questionnaire. Participants were divided into low, middle, and high groups according to the degree of the epidemic in their region of residence. Related factors were analyzed using the chi‐squared test. The relationship between COVID‐19 epidemic regions and depression risks and anxiety using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and Kessler 6 scale (K6) was evaluated using a univariate and multivariable logistic regression model. RESULTS: Overall, 7775 cases, including 4798 pregnant and 2977 puerperal women, were analyzed. The prevalence of high EPDS and K6 scores was significantly increased in pregnant women in the high than those in the low epidemic regions (EPDS: adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.453, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.205–1.753; K6: aOR 1.601, 95% CI 1.338–1.918). There was no difference in EPDS score, but the prevalence of high K6 scores was significantly increased in puerperal women in the high than those in the low epidemic regions (aOR 1.342, 95% CI 1.066–1.690). Further, restriction on going to their hometown for delivery increased the prevalence of high EPDS scores among pregnant (aOR 1.663, 95% CI 1.296–2.133) and puerperal women (aOR 1.604, 95% CI 1.006–2.557).

A large number of patients with atrial fibrillation, venous thromboembolism, or valvular heart disease are chronically anticoagulated with vitamin K antagonists and rely on frequent follow ups at anticoagulation clinics for management of their anticoagulation therapy. The need for isolation during COVID-19 pandemic can potentially limit access to health care including anticoagulation clinics and directly affect the care of patients on chronic anticoagulation. Therefore, we created a drive-through clinic to bridge the gap of continuation of care and preservation of social distancing precautions. In this manuscript, we report the steps in implementing such initiative which can be applied to other clinics during a pandemic.","Rezaei Bookani, Kaveh; Minga, Iva; Chander, Manisha; Hankewych, Ksenia; Plassmeier, Matthew; Tafur, Alfonso",Clin Appl Thromb Hemost,479,27

The present article offers guidance and examples of how each of us as behavior analysts might build individualized self-management behavior change plans that support initiating and sustaining socially significant antiracism work as we move from allies to accomplices within our own sphere of influence. This article introduces the concept of self-managed antiracism behavior change plans that (a) operationally define antiracist action using measurable outcomes and strategies for data collection on specific antiracist and support actions, (b) provide choices to improve engagement and reduce barriers to adherence, and (c) use effective behavioral interventions to alter the availability of discriminative stimuli or reduce their influence, and increase the availability of reinforcers that are compatible with the goal of the behavior change plan for increasing antiracism behavior and dismantling structures perpetuating racial inequities.","Machalicek, Wendy; Strickland-Cohen, Kathleen; Drew, Christine; Cohen-Lissman, Dana",Behav Anal Pract,479,20

However, their uptake has been low and slow due to privacy concerns, the lack of trust and motivational affordances, and their minimalist design. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this article is to present a protocol for a systematic review of the main factors, including facilitators and barriers, that influence the adoption of contact tracing apps. METHODS: We searched seven databases, namely, Scopus, CINAHL, PubMed (MEDLINE), IEEE Xplore Digital Library, Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Digital Library, Web of Science, and Google Scholar, for relevant publications between October 30, 2020, and January 31, 2021. Three authors were involved in removing duplicates, screening, and selection of relevant articles according to the PRISMA-P (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Protocols) guidelines. RESULTS: Altogether, we retrieved 777 articles from the seven databases. As of May 14, 2021, we have completed the screening process and arrived at 13 eligible articles to be included in the systematic review. We hope to elicit, summarize, and report the main findings in the systematic review article by the end of August 2021. We expect to uncover facilitators and barriers related to app utility, data security, ease of use, and persuasive design that are deemed important to adoption of contact tracing apps. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the systematic review will help researchers to uncover the gaps in the adoption of contact tracing apps, and decision makers and designers to focus on the principal adoption factors necessary to create better and more effective contact tracing apps.

They are considered as protective equipment to preserve the respiratory system against the non-desirable air droplets and aerosols such as the viral or pollution particles. The aerosols can be pollution existence in the air, or the infectious airborne viruses initiated from the sneezing, coughing of the infected people. The filtration efficiency of the different masks against these aerosols are not the same, as the particles have different sizes, shapes, and properties. Therefore, the challenge is to fabricate the filtration masks with higher efficiency to decrease the penetration percentage at the nastiest conditions. To achieve this concept, knowledge about the mechanisms of the penetration of the aerosols through the masks at different effective environmental conditions is necessary. In this paper, the literature about the different kinds of face masks and respiratory masks, common cases of their application, and the advantages and disadvantages of them in this regard have been reviewed. Moreover, the related mechanisms of the penetration of the aerosols through the masks are discussed. The environmental conditions affecting the penetration as well as the quality of the fabrication are studied. Finally, special attention was given to the numerical simulation related to the different existing mechanisms.","Tcharkhtchi, A.; Abbasnezhad, N.; Zarbini Seydani, M.; Zirak, N.; Farzaneh, S.; Shirinbayan, M.",Bioactive Materials,479,1
