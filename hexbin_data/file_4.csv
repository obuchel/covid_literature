4,4,4,Gene expression in epithelial cells in response to pneumovirus infection,11.964405,7.800829,2001-05-11,"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and pneumonia virus of mice (PVM) are viruses of the family Paramyxoviridae, subfamily pneumovirus, which cause clinically important respiratory infections in humans and rodents, respectively. The respiratory epithelial target cells respond to viral infection with specific alterations in gene expression, including production of chemoattractant cytokines, adhesion molecules, elements that are related to the apoptosis response, and others that remain incompletely understood. Here we review our current understanding of these mucosal responses and discuss several genomic approaches, including differential display reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and gene array strategies, that will permit us to unravel the nature of these responses in a more complete and systematic manner.","Domachowske, Joseph B; Bonville, Cynthia A; Rosenberg, Helene F",Respir Res,4,1
108,108,108,Natural Killer Cells Promote Early CD8 T Cell Responses against Cytomegalovirus,11.598344,8.070103,2007-08-24,"Understanding the mechanisms that help promote protective immune responses to pathogens is a major challenge in biomedical research and an important goal for the design of innovative therapeutic or vaccination strategies. While natural killer (NK) cells can directly contribute to the control of viral replication, whether, and how, they may help orchestrate global antiviral defense is largely unknown. To address this question, we took advantage of the well-defined molecular interactions involved in the recognition of mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) by NK cells. By using congenic or mutant mice and wild-type versus genetically engineered viruses, we examined the consequences on antiviral CD8 T cell responses of specific defects in the ability of the NK cells to control MCMV. This system allowed us to demonstrate, to our knowledge for the first time, that NK cells accelerate CD8 T cell responses against a viral infection in vivo. Moreover, we identify the underlying mechanism as the ability of NK cells to limit IFN-α/β production to levels not immunosuppressive to the host. This is achieved through the early control of cytomegalovirus, which dramatically reduces the activation of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) for cytokine production, preserves the conventional dendritic cell (cDC) compartment, and accelerates antiviral CD8 T cell responses. Conversely, exogenous IFN-α administration in resistant animals ablates cDCs and delays CD8 T cell activation in the face of NK cell control of viral replication. Collectively, our data demonstrate that the ability of NK cells to respond very early to cytomegalovirus infection critically contributes to balance the intensity of other innate immune responses, which dampens early immunopathology and promotes optimal initiation of antiviral CD8 T cell responses. Thus, the extent to which NK cell responses benefit the host goes beyond their direct antiviral effects and extends to the prevention of innate cytokine shock and to the promotion of adaptive immunity.","Robbins, Scott H; Bessou, Gilles; Cornillon, Amélie; Zucchini, Nicolas; Rupp, Brigitte; Ruzsics, Zsolt; Sacher, Torsten; Tomasello, Elena; Vivier, Eric; Koszinowski, Ulrich H; Dalod, Marc",PLoS Pathog,4,8
160,160,160,No Longer an Innocent Bystander: Epithelial Toll-Like Receptor Signaling in the Development of Mucosal Inflammation,11.796868,7.794018,2008-06-17,"Diseases of mucosal inflammation represent important causes of morbidity and mortality, and have led to intense research efforts to understand the factors that lead to their development. It is well accepted that a breakdown of the normally impermeant epithelial barrier of the intestine, the lung, and the kidney is associated with the development of inflammatory disease in these organs, yet significant controversy exists as to how this breakdown actually occurs, and how such a breakdown may lead to inflammation. In this regard, much work has focused upon the role of the epithelium as an “innocent bystander,” a target of a leukocyte-mediated inflammatory cascade that leads to its destruction in the mucosal inflammatory process. However, recent evidence from a variety of laboratories indicates that the epithelium is not merely a passive component in the steps that lead to mucosal inflammation, but is a central participant in the process. In addressing this controversy, we and others have determined that epithelial cells express Toll-like receptors (TLRs) of the innate immune system, and that activation of TLRs by endogenous and exogenous ligands may play a central role in determining the balance between a state of “mucosal homeostasis,” as is required for optimal organ function, and “mucosal injury,” leading to mucosal inflammation and barrier breakdown. In particular, activation of TLRs within intestinal epithelial cells leads to the development of cellular injury and impairment in mucosal repair in the pathogenesis of intestinal inflammation, while activation of TLRs in the lung and kidney may participate in the development of pneumonitis and nephritis respectively. Recent work in support of these concepts is extensively reviewed, while essential areas of further study that are required to determine the significance of epithelial TLR signaling during states of health and disease are outlined.","Gribar, Steven C; Richardson, Ward M; Sodhi, Chhinder P; Hackam, David J",Mol Med,4,22
250,250,250,Mapping the sequence mutations of the 2009 H1N1 influenza A virus neuraminidase relative to drug and antibody binding sites,11.92968,8.179378,2009-05-20,"In this work, we study the consequences of sequence variations of the ""2009 H1N1"" (swine or Mexican flu) influenza A virus strain neuraminidase for drug treatment and vaccination. We find that it is phylogenetically more closely related to European H1N1 swine flu and H5N1 avian flu rather than to the H1N1 counterparts in the Americas. Homology-based 3D structure modeling reveals that the novel mutations are preferentially located at the protein surface and do not interfere with the active site. The latter is the binding cavity for 3 currently used neuraminidase inhibitors: oseltamivir (Tamiflu(®)), zanamivir (Relenza(®)) and peramivir; thus, the drugs should remain effective for treatment. However, the antigenic regions of the neuraminidase relevant for vaccine development, serological typing and passive antibody treatment can differ from those of previous strains and already vary among patients.

383,383,383,Elevation of Intact and Proteolytic Fragments of Acute Phase Proteins Constitutes the Earliest Systemic Antiviral Response in HIV-1 Infection,12.11247,7.823002,2010-05-06,"The earliest immune responses activated in acute human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection (AHI) exert a critical influence on subsequent virus spread or containment. During this time frame, components of the innate immune system such as macrophages and DCs, NK cells, β-defensins, complement and other anti-microbial factors, which have all been implicated in modulating HIV infection, may play particularly important roles. A proteomics-based screen was performed on a cohort from whom samples were available at time points prior to the earliest positive HIV detection. The ability of selected factors found to be elevated in the plasma during AHI to inhibit HIV-1 replication was analyzed using in vitro PBMC and DC infection models. Analysis of unique plasma donor panels spanning the eclipse and viral expansion phases revealed very early alterations in plasma proteins in AHI. Induction of acute phase protein serum amyloid A (A-SAA) occurred as early as 5–7 days prior to the first detection of plasma viral RNA, considerably prior to any elevation in systemic cytokine levels. Furthermore, a proteolytic fragment of alpha–1-antitrypsin (AAT), termed virus inhibitory peptide (VIRIP), was observed in plasma coincident with viremia. Both A-SAA and VIRIP have anti-viral activity in vitro and quantitation of their plasma levels indicated that circulating concentrations are likely to be within the range of their inhibitory activity. Our results provide evidence for a first wave of host anti-viral defense occurring in the eclipse phase of AHI prior to systemic activation of other immune responses. Insights gained into the mechanism of action of acute-phase reactants and other innate molecules against HIV and how they are induced could be exploited for the future development of more efficient prophylactic vaccine strategies.","Kramer, Holger B.; Lavender, Kerry J.; Qin, Li; Stacey, Andrea R.; Liu, Michael K.

438,438,438,Role of Host Immune Response and Viral Load in the Differential Outcome of Pandemic H1N1 (2009) Influenza Virus Infection in Indian Patients,11.98399,7.9636416,2010-10-01,"BACKGROUND: An unusually high number of severe pneumonia cases with considerable mortality is being observed with the pandemic H1N1 2009 virus infections globally. In India, all mild as well as critically ill cases were admitted and treated in the government hospitals during the initial phase of the pandemic. The present study was undertaken during this early phase of the pandemic. METHODOLOGY: The role of viral load and host factors in the pathogenesis were assessed by examining 26 mild (MP), 15 critically ill patients (CIP) and 20 healthy controls from Pune, India. Sequential blood and lung aspirate samples were collected from CIP. Viral load and cytokines/chemokine levels were determined from the plasma and lung aspirates of the patients. TLR levels were determined by staining and FACS analysis. Gene profiling was done for both cells in the lung aspirates and PBMCs using TaqMan Low Density arrays. Antibody titres and isotyping was done using HA protein based ELISAs. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: 13/15 critically ill patients expired. All plasma samples were negative for the virus irrespective of the patient's category. Sequential lung samples from CIP showed lower viral loads questioning association of viral replication with the severity. Anti-rpH1N1-09-HA-IgG titres were significantly higher in critically ill patients and both categories circulated exclusively IgG1 isotype. Critically ill patients exhibited increase in TLR-3, 4, 7 and decrease in TLR-2 expressions. The disease severity correlated with increased plasma levels of IL1RA, IL2, IL6, CCL3, CCL4 and IL10. Majority of the immune-function genes were down-regulated in the PBMCs and up-regulated in the cells from lung aspirates of critically ill patients. No distinct pattern differentiating fatal and surviving patients was observed when sequential samples were examined for various parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Disease severity was associated with pronounced impairment of host immune response.","Arankalle, Vidya A.; Lole, Kavita S.; Arya, Ravi P.; Tripathy, Anuradha S.; Ramdasi, Ashwini Y.; Chadha, Mandeep S.; Sangle, Shashi A.; Kadam, Deelip B.",PLoS One,4,28
477,477,477,Liposome-Coupled Antigens Are Internalized by Antigen-Presenting Cells via Pinocytosis and Cross-Presented to CD8(+) T Cells,11.8329935,8.150857,2010-12-17,"We have previously demonstrated that antigens chemically coupled to the surface of liposomes consisting of unsaturated fatty acids were cross-presented by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) to CD8(+) T cells, and that this process resulted in the induction of antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes. In the present study, the mechanism by which the liposome-coupled antigens were cross-presented to CD8(+) T cells by APCs was investigated. Confocal laser scanning microscopic analysis demonstrated that antigens coupled to the surface of unsaturated-fatty-acid-based liposomes received processing at both MHC class I and class II compartments, while most of the antigens coupled to the surface of saturated-fatty-acid-based liposomes received processing at the class II compartment. In addition, flow cytometric analysis demonstrated that antigens coupled to the surface of unsaturated-fatty-acid-liposomes were taken up by APCs even in a 4°C environment; this was not true of saturated-fatty-acid-liposomes. When two kinds of inhibitors, dimethylamiloride (DMA) and cytochalasin B, which inhibit pinocytosis and phagocytosis by APCs, respectively, were added to the culture of APCs prior to the antigen pulse, DMA but not cytochalasin B significantly reduced uptake of liposome-coupled antigens. Further analysis of intracellular trafficking of liposomal antigens using confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed that a portion of liposome-coupled antigens taken up by APCs were delivered to the lysosome compartment. In agreement with the reduction of antigen uptake by APCs, antigen presentation by APCs was significantly inhibited by DMA, and resulted in the reduction of IFN-γ production by antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells. These results suggest that antigens coupled to the surface of liposomes consisting of unsaturated fatty acids might be pinocytosed by APCs, loaded onto the class I MHC processing pathway, and presented to CD8(+) T cells. Thus, these liposome-coupled antigens are expected to be applicable for the development of vaccines that induce cellular immunity.","Tanaka, Yuriko; Taneichi, Maiko; Kasai, Michiyuki; Kakiuchi, Terutaka; Uchida, Tetsuya",PLoS One,4,1

Although PALS1 is a central component of the cell polarity network, its expression and function in lymphocytes remains unknown. Here we investigated whether PALS1 is present in T cells and whether it contributes to T Cell-Receptor (TCR)-mediated activation. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: By combining RT-PCR and immunoblot assays, we found that PALS1 is constitutively expressed in human T lymphocytes as well as in Jurkat T cells. siRNA-based knockdown of PALS1 hampered TCR-induced activation and optimal proliferation of lymphocyte. We further provide evidence that PALS1 depletion selectively hindered TCR-driven activation of the transcription factor NF-κB. CONCLUSIONS: The cell polarity protein PALS1 is expressed in T lymphocytes and participates to the optimal activation of NF-κB following TCR stimulation.","Carvalho, Gabrielle; Poalas, Konstantinos; Demian, Catherine; Hatchi, Emeline; Vazquez, Aimé; Bidère, Nicolas",PLoS One,4,8

However, a diagnostic microarray containing probes for all human pathogens could replace hundreds of individual PCR-reactions and remove the need for a clear clinical hypothesis regarding a suspected pathogen. We have established such a diagnostic platform for random amplification and subsequent microarray identification of viral pathogens in clinical samples. We show that Phi29 polymerase-amplification of a diverse set of clinical samples generates enough viral material for successful identification by the Microbial Detection Array, demonstrating the potential of the microarray technique for broad-spectrum pathogen detection. We conclude that this method detects both DNA and RNA virus, present in the same sample, as well as differentiates between different virus subtypes. We propose this assay for diagnostic analysis of viruses in clinical samples.","Erlandsson, Lena; Rosenstierne, Maiken W.; McLoughlin, Kevin; Jaing, Crystal; Fomsgaard, Anders",PLoS One,4,28

The role of NKG2D-mediated augmentation in the clearance of central nervous system viral infections has not been explored.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a ubiquitous herpesvirus, and Kaposi’s sarcoma–associated herpesvirus (KSHV) has a restricted seroprevalence. Both viruses are associated with malignancies that have an increased frequency in individuals who are coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Methods. To obtain an overview of humoral immune responses to these viruses, we generated a protein array that displayed 174 EBV and KSHV polypeptides purified from yeast. Antibody responses to EBV and KSHV were examined in plasma from healthy volunteers and patients with B cell lymphoma or with AIDS-related Kaposi’s sarcoma or lymphoma. Results. In addition to the commonly studied antigens, IgG responses were frequently detected to the tegument proteins KSHV ORF38 and EBV BBRF and BGLF2 and BNRF1 and to the EBV early lytic proteins BRRF1 and BORF2. The EBV vIL-10 protein was particularly well recognized by plasma IgA. The most intense IgG responses to EBV antigens occurred in HIV-1–positive patients. No clear correlation was observed between viral DNA load in plasma and antibody profile. Conclusions.

787,787,787,Suppression of Adenosine-Activated Chloride Transport by Ethanol in Airway Epithelia,11.764247,7.9675884,2012-03-19,"Alcohol abuse is associated with increased lung infections. Molecular understanding of the underlying mechanisms is not complete. Airway epithelial ion transport regulates the homeostasis of airway surface liquid, essential for airway mucosal immunity and lung host defense. Here, air-liquid interface cultures of Calu-3 epithelial cells were basolaterally exposed to physiologically relevant concentrations of ethanol (0, 25, 50 and 100 mM) for 24 hours and adenosine-stimulated ion transport was measured by Ussing chamber. The ethanol exposure reduced the epithelial short-circuit currents (I(SC)) in a dose-dependent manner. The ion currents activated by adenosine were chloride conductance mediated by cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a cAMP-activated chloride channel. Alloxazine, a specific inhibitor for A(2B) adenosine receptor (A(2B)AR), largely abolished the adenosine-stimulated chloride transport, suggesting that A(2B)AR is a major receptor responsible for regulating the chloride transport of the cells. Ethanol significantly reduced intracellular cAMP production upon adenosine stimulation. Moreover, ethanol-suppression of the chloride secretion was able to be restored by cAMP analogs or by inhibitors to block cAMP degradation. These results imply that ethanol exposure dysregulates CFTR-mediated chloride transport in airways by suppression of adenosine-A(2B)AR-cAMP signaling pathway, which might contribute to alcohol-associated lung infections.","Raju, Sammeta V.; Wang, Guoshun",PLoS One,4,1
925,925,925,Toll-like receptors are critical for clearance of Brucella and play different roles in development of adaptive immunity following aerosol challenge in mice,11.7544775,8.116981,2012-09-07,"Brucella spp. cause undulant fever in humans and brucellosis in variety of other animals. Both innate and adaptive immunity have been shown to be important in controlling Brucella infection. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) represent a group of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that play critical roles in the host innate immune response, as well as development of adaptive immunity. In the current report, we investigated the role of TLR signaling in the clearance of Brucella and development of adaptive immunity in TLR2(−/−), TLR4(−/−), or MyD88(−/−) mice following aerosol exposure to B. melitensis 16 M. Consistent with previous reports, MyD88 is required for efficient clearance of Brucella from all three organs (lung, spleen, and liver). The results reveal Th2-skewed immune responses in TLR2(−/−) mice late in infection and support a TLR2 requirement for efficient clearance of Brucella from the lungs, but not from the spleen or liver. Similarly, TLR4 is required for efficient clearance of Brucella from the lung, but exhibits a minor contribution to clearance from the spleen and no demonstrable contribution to clearance from the liver. Lymphocyte proliferation assays suggest that the TLRs are not involved in the development of cell-mediated memory response to Brucella antigen. Antibody detection reveals that TLR2 and 4 are required to generate early antigen-specific IgG, but not during the late stages of infection. TLR2 and 4 are only transiently required for IgM production and not at all for IgA production. In contrast, MyD88 is essential for antigen specific IgG production late in infection, but is not required for IgM generation over the course of infection. Surprisingly, despite the prominent role for MyD88 in clearance from all tissues, MyD88-knockout mice express significantly higher levels of serum IgA. These results confirm the important role of MyD88 in controlling infection in the spleen while providing evidence of a prominent contribution to protection in other tissues. In addition, although TLR4 and TLR2 contribute little to control of spleen infection, a significant contribution to clearance of lung infection is described.","Pei, Jianwu; Ding, Xicheng; Fan, Yaping; Rice-Ficht, Allison; Ficht, Thomas A.",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,4,8

1081,1081,1081,Native Tertiary Structure and Nucleoside Modifications Suppress tRNA’s Intrinsic Ability to Activate the Innate Immune Sensor PKR,11.901969,7.9834466,2013-03-04,"Interferon inducible protein kinase PKR is an essential component of innate immunity. It is activated by long stretches of dsRNA and provides the first line of host defense against pathogens by inhibiting translation initiation in the infected cell. Many cellular and viral transcripts contain nucleoside modifications and/or tertiary structure that could affect PKR activation. We have previously demonstrated that a 5′-end triphosphate–a signature of certain viral and bacterial transcripts–confers the ability of relatively unstructured model RNA transcripts to activate PKR to inhibit translation, and that this activation is abrogated by certain modifications present in cellular RNAs. In order to understand the biological implications of native RNA tertiary structure and nucleoside modifications on PKR activation, we study here the heavily modified cellular tRNAs and the unmodified or the lightly modified mitochondrial tRNAs (mt-tRNA). We find that both a T7 transcript of yeast tRNA(Phe) and natively extracted total bovine liver mt-tRNA activate PKR in vitro, whereas native E. coli, bovine liver, yeast, and wheat tRNA(Phe) do not, nor do a variety of base- or sugar-modified T7 transcripts. These results are further supported by activation of PKR by a natively folded T7 transcript of tRNA(Phe) in vivo supporting the importance of tRNA modification in suppressing PKR activation in cells. We also examine PKR activation by a T7 transcript of the A14G pathogenic mutant of mt-tRNA(Leu), which is known to dimerize, and find that the misfolded dimeric form activates PKR in vitro while the monomeric form does not. Overall, the in vitro and in vivo findings herein indicate that tRNAs have an intrinsic ability to activate PKR and that nucleoside modifications and native RNA tertiary folding may function, at least in part, to suppress such activation, thus serving to distinguish self and non-self tRNA in innate immunity.","Nallagatla, Subba Rao; Jones, Christie N.; Ghosh, Saikat Kumar B.; Sharma, Suresh D.; Cameron, Craig E.; Spremulli, Linda L.; Bevilacqua, Philip C.",PLoS One,4,1

Despite the obvious clinical implications associated with the presence of circulating RNA, its pathological effects on endothelial cells and the governing molecular mechanisms are still not fully elucidated. We analyzed the effects of double stranded RNA on primary human pulmonary artery endothelial cells (hPAECs). The effect of natural and synthetic double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) on hPAECs was investigated using trans-endothelial electric resistance, molecule trafficking, calcium (Ca(2+)) homeostasis, gene expression and proliferation studies. Furthermore, the morphology and mechanical changes of the cells caused by synthetic dsRNA was followed by in-situ atomic force microscopy, by vascular-endothelial cadherin and F-actin staining. Our results indicated that exposure of hPAECs to synthetic dsRNA led to functional deficits. This was reflected by morphological and mechanical changes and an increase in the permeability of the endothelial monolayer. hPAECs treated with synthetic dsRNA accumulated in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Additionally, the proliferation rate of the cells in the presence of synthetic dsRNA was significantly decreased. Furthermore, we found that natural and synthetic dsRNA modulated Ca(2+) signaling in hPAECs by inhibiting the sarco-endoplasmic Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA) which is involved in the regulation of the intracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis and thus cell growth. Even upon synthetic dsRNA stimulation silencing of SERCA3 preserved the endothelial monolayer integrity.

However, current parenteral immunization modalities generally fail to induce mucosal immunity, while mucosal vaccine delivery often results in poor systemic immunity. In order to find an immunization strategy which satisfies the need for induction of both mucosal and systemic immunity, we compared local and systemic immune responses elicited by two mucosal immunizations, given either by the intranasal (IN) or the intrapulmonary (IPL) route, with responses elicited by a mucosal prime followed by a systemic boost immunization. The study was conducted in BALB/c mice and the vaccine formulation was an influenza subunit vaccine supplemented with GPI-0100, a saponin-derived adjuvant. While optimal mucosal antibody titers were obtained after two intrapulmonary vaccinations, optimal systemic antibody responses were achieved by intranasal prime followed by intramuscular boost. The latter strategy also resulted in the best T cell response, yet, it was ineffective in inducing nose or lung IgA. Successful induction of secretory IgA, IgG and T cell responses was only achieved with prime-boost strategies involving intrapulmonary immunization and was optimal when both immunizations were given via the intrapulmonary route. Our results underline that immunization via the lungs is particularly effective for priming as well as boosting of local and systemic immune responses.","Liu, Heng; Patil, Harshad P.; de Vries-Idema, Jacqueline; Wilschut, Jan; Huckriede, Anke",PLoS One,4,1

Importantly, asymmetry of protein distribution in lymphocyte division is a basic biological feature of cell division with the degree of the asymmetry depending on various factors. Here, we review the recent literature on asymmetric lymphocyte division and CFSE-based lymphocyte proliferation analysis.

1325,1325,1325,miRNomes of haematopoietic stem cells and dendritic cells identify miR-30b as a regulator of Notch1,12.032209,7.9801245,2013-12-06,"Dendritic cells (DCs) are critical to initiate the immune response and maintain tolerance, depending on different status and subsets. The expression profiles of microRNAs (miRNAs) in various DC subsets and haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), which generate DCs, remain to be fully identified. Here we examine miRNomes of mouse bone marrow HSCs, immature DCs, mature DCs and IL-10/NO-producing regulatory DCs by deep sequencing. We identify numerous stage-specific miRNAs and histone modification in HSCs and DCs at different differentiation stages. miR-30b, significantly upregulated via a TGF-beta/Smad3-mediated epigenetic pathway in regulatory DCs, can target Notch1 to promote IL-10 and NO production, suggesting that miR-30b is a negative regulator of immune response. We also identify miRNomes of in vivo counterparts of mature DCs and regulatory DCs and systematically compare them with DCs cultured in vitro. These results provide a resource for studying roles of miRNAs in stem cell biology, development and functional regulation of DC subsets.","Su, Xiaoping; Qian, Cheng; Zhang, Qian; Hou, Jin; Gu, Yan; Han, Yanmei; Chen, Yongjian; Jiang, Minghong; Cao, Xuetao",Nat Commun,4,1

Our previous work reported on an EV71-infected rhesus monkey infant model that presented with histo-pathologic changes of the central nervous system (CNS) and lungs. This study is focused on the correlated modulation of gene expression in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from EV71-infected rhesus monkey infants. The expression of more than 500 functional genes associated with multiple pathways was modulated. The expression of genes associated with immune inflammatory responses was up-regulated during the period from days 4 to 10 post-infection. The expression of two genes (TAC1 and IL17A), which play major roles in inflammatory reactions, was remarkably up-regulated during the infection period. Furthermore, a higher expression level of the TAC1 gene was identified in the CNS compared to the lungs, but a high expression level of the IL-17A gene was observed in the lungs and not in the CNS. The results of this study suggest at least two facts about EV71 infection, which are that: the TAC1 gene that encodes substance P and neurokinin-A is present in both PBMCs and the hypothalamus; and the up-regulation of IL-17A is sustained in the peripheral blood.","Zhang, Ying; Yang, Erxia; Pu, Jing; Liu, Longding; Che, Yanchun; Wang, Jingjing; Liao, Yun; Wang, Lichun; Ding, Dong; Zhao, Ting; Ma, Na; Song, Ming; Wang, Xi; Shen, Dong; Tang, Donghong; Huang, Hongtai; Zhang, Zhixiao; Chen, Dai; Feng, Mingfei; Li, Qihan",PLoS One,4,1

Quercetin is flavonoid that occurs naturally in plants and is widely used as a nutritional supplement due to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. In this study, we investigated antioxidant activities and mechanisms of action in zymosan-induced macrophages of quercetin and quercetin-related flavonoids such as quercitrin, isoquercitrin, quercetin 3-O-β-(2″-galloyl)-rhamnopyranoside (QGR) and quercetin 3-O-β-(2″-galloyl)-glucopyranoside (QGG) as well as gallic acid, a building moiety of QGR and QGG. QGR and QGG exhibited stronger antioxidant activities compared with quercetin, whereas quercitrin, isoquercitrin and gallic acid exhibited weak-tono antioxidant activities, assessed by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging, superoxide production, superoxide scavenging, nitric oxide (NO) production, peroxynitrite (ONOO(−)) scavenging and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity. Regarding mechanisms, the quercetincontaining flavonoids QGR and QGG differentially targeted compared with quercetin in the NF-κB signaling pathway that inhibited the DNA binding activity of the NF-κB complex without affecting the degradation and phosphorylation of IκBα and NF-κB phosphorylation. In addition, QGR and QGG inhibited CRE and activator protein (AP-1) transcriptional activity and JNK phosphorylation by inhibiting the cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) and protein kinase C (PKC) signaling in a different manner than quercetin. Our results showed that although QGR and QGG exhibited stronger antioxidant activities than querce-tin in macrophages, their mechanisms of action in terms of the NF-κB, PKA and PKC signaling pathways were different.","Kim, Byung-Hak; Choi, Jung Sook; Yi, Eun Hee; Lee, Jin-Ku; Won, Cheolhee; Ye, Sang-Kyu; Kim, Myoung-Hwan",Molecules and Cells,4,1

As AIDS vaccine recipients will not be exposed to strains exactly matching any immunogens due to multiple HIV-1 quasispecies circulating in the human population worldwide, heterologous SHIV challenges are essential for realistic vaccine efficacy testing in primates. We assessed whether polyclonal IgG, isolated from rhesus monkeys (RMs) with high-titer nAbs (termed SHIVIG), could protect RMs against the R5-tropic tier-2 SHIV-2873Nip, which was heterologous to the viruses or HIV-1 envelopes that had elicited SHIVIG. RESULTS: SHIVIG demonstrated binding to HIV Gag, Tat, and Env of different clades and competed with the broadly neutralizing antibodies b12, VRC01, 4E10, and 17b. SHIVIG neutralized tier 1 and tier 2 viruses, including SHIV-2873Nip. NK-cell depletion decreased the neutralizing activity of SHIVIG 20-fold in PBMC assays. Although SHIVIG neutralized SHIV-2873Nip in vitro, this polyclonal IgG preparation failed to prevent acquisition after repeated intrarectal low-dose virus challenges, but at a dose of 400 mg/kg, it significantly lowered peak viremia (P = 0.001). Unexpectedly, single-genome analysis revealed a higher number of transmitted variants at the low dose of 25 mg/kg, implying increased acquisition at low SHIVIG levels. In vitro, SHIVIG demonstrated complement-mediated Ab-dependent enhancement of infection (C’-ADE) at concentrations similar to those observed in plasmas of RMs treated with 25 mg/kg of SHIVIG. CONCLUSION: Our primate model data suggest a dual role for polyclonal anti-HIV-1 Abs depending on plasma levels upon virus encounter.","Sholukh, Anton M; Byrareddy, Siddappa N; Shanmuganathan, Vivekanandan; Hemashettar, Girish; Lakhashe, Samir K; Rasmussen, Robert A; Watkins, Jennifer D; Vyas, Hemant K; Thorat, Swati; Brandstoetter, Tania; Mukhtar, Muhammad M; Yoon, John K; Novembre, Francis J; Villinger, Francois; Landucci, Gary; Forthal, Donald N; Ratcliffe, Sarah; Tuero, Iskra; Robert-Guroff, Marjorie; Polonis, Victoria R; Bilska, Miroslawa; Montefiori, David C; Johnson, Welkin E; Ertl, Hildegund C; Ruprecht, Ruth M",Retrovirology,4,1

Recently, we showed that the structurally similar flavonoids baicalein and biochanin A inhibit highly pathogenic avian H5N1 influenza A virus replication by different mechanisms in A549 lung cells. Here, we investigated the effects of both compounds on H5N1-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation and the role of ROS formation during H5N1 replication. FINDINGS: Baicalein and biochanin A enhanced H5N1-induced ROS formation in A549 cells and primary human monocyte-derived macrophages. Suppression of ROS formation induced by baicalein and biochanin A using the antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine strongly increased the anti-H5N1 activity of both compounds in A549 cells but not in macrophages. CONCLUSIONS: These findings emphasise that flavonoids induce complex pharmacological actions some of which may interfere with H5N1 replication while others may support H5N1 replication. A more detailed understanding of these actions and the underlying structure-activity relationships is needed to design agents with optimised anti-H5N1 activity.","Michaelis, Martin; Sithisarn, Patchima; Cinatl Jr, Jindrich",BMC Res Notes,4,28

Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) is a standard method for quantification of gene expression studies. However, the reliability of qRT-PCR data critically depends on proper selection of reference genes. In the study, using two different analysis programs, geNorm and NormFinder, we systematically evaluated the gene expression stability of six candidate reference genes (GAPDH, ACTB, B2M, RPL4, TBP, and PPIA) in samples of whole blood and PBMC with or without poly I:C stimulation. Generally, the six candidate genes performed a similar trend of expression stability in the samples of whole blood and PBMC, but more stably expressed in whole blood than in PBMC. geNorm ranked B2M and PPIA as the best combination for gene expression normalization, while according to NormFinder, TBP was ranked as the most stable reference gene, followed by B2M and PPIA. Comprehensively considering the results from the two programs, we recommended using the geometric mean of the three genes, TBP, PPIA and B2M, to normalize the gene expression of whole blood and PBMC with poly I:C stimulation. Our study is the first detailed survey of the gene expression stability in whole blood and PBMC with or without poly I:C stimulation and should be helpful for investigating the molecular mechanism involved in porcine whole blood and PBMC in response to poly I:C stimulation.","Wang, Jiying; Wang, Yanping; Wang, Huaizhong; Hao, Xiaojing; Wu, Ying; Guo, Jianfeng",Asian-Australas J Anim Sci,4,1

The continuous rapid evolution of these subtypes and the emergence of new variants influence the ability to undertake effective surveillance. Retroviral pseudotypes bearing influenza haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) envelope glycoproteins represent a flexible platform for sensitive, readily standardized influenza serological assays. We describe a multiplex assay for the study of neutralizing antibodies that are directed against both influenza H5 and H7 HA. This assay permits the measurement of neutralizing antibody responses against two antigenically distinct HAs in the same serum/plasma sample thus increasing the amount and quality of serological data that can be acquired from valuable sera. Sera obtained from chickens vaccinated with a monovalent H5N2 vaccine, chickens vaccinated with a bivalent H7N1/H5N9 vaccine, or turkeys naturally infected with an H7N3 virus were evaluated in this assay and the results correlated strongly with data obtained by HI assay. We show that pseudotypes are highly stable under basic cold-chain storage conditions and following multiple rounds of freeze-thaw. We propose that this robust assay may have practical utility for in-field serosurveillance and vaccine studies in resource-limited regions worldwide.","Molesti, Eleonora; Wright, Edward; Terregino, Calogero; Rahman, Rafat; Cattoli, Giovanni; Temperton, Nigel J.",J Immunol Res,4,1

Prior to the pandemic, many countries stockpiled NAIs and developed pandemic plans for the use of antiviral drugs, based on either treatment of high-risk individuals and/or prophylaxis of contacts. However, to date there has been a lack of in vivo models to test the efficacy of treatment or prophylaxis with NAIs, for influenza-infected individuals or exposed contacts, in a household setting. METHODS: A ferret model of household contact was developed to study the efficacy of different prophylaxis regimens in preventing infection in contact ferrets exposed to influenza A(H1N1)pdm09-infected index ferrets. RESULTS: Among the different prophylactic regimens, contact ferrets receiving oseltamivir prophylaxis twice daily showed better outcomes than those receiving oseltamivir once daily. Benefits included a significant delay in the time to secondary infection, lower weight loss and higher activity levels. The treatment of index ferrets at 36 h post-infection did not influence either secondary infection rates or clinical symptoms in exposed contact ferrets. Neither prophylaxis nor treatment prevented infection or reduced the duration of viral shedding, although clinical symptoms did improve in infected animals receiving prophylaxis. CONCLUSIONS: Different oseltamivir prophylaxis regimens did not prevent infections, but consistently resulted in a reduction in symptoms in infected ferrets. However, oseltamivir prophylaxis failed to reduce viral titres, which warrants further investigation in humans.","Oh, Ding Yuan; Lowther, Sue; McCaw, James M.; Sullivan, Sheena G.; Leang, Sook-Kwan; Haining, Jessica; Arkinstall, Rachel; Kelso, Anne; Mcvernon, Jodie; Barr, Ian G.; Middleton, Deborah; Hurt, Aeron C.",J Antimicrob Chemother,4,28

Many of these factors are released into exosomes, which are small membranous vesicles that participate in cell–cell communication. Exosomes from MSCs are thought to have similar functions to MSCs such as repairing and regeneration of damaged tissue, but little is known about the immunomodulatory effect of these vesicles. Based on an extensive bibliography where the immunomodulatory capacity of MSCs has been demonstrated, here we hypothesized that released exosomes from MSCs may have an immunomodulatory role on the differentiation, activation and function of different lymphocyte subsets. According to this hypothesis, in vitro experiments were performed to characterize the immunomodulatory effect of human adipose MSCs derived exosomes (exo-hASCs) on in vitro stimulated T cells. The phenotypic characterization of cytotoxic and helper T cells (activation and differentiation markers) together with functional assays (proliferation and IFN-γ production) demonstrated that exo-hASCs exerted an inhibitory effect in the differentiation and activation of T cells as well as a reduced T cell proliferation and IFN-γ release on in vitro stimulated cells. In summary, here we demonstrate that MSCs-derived exosomes are a cell-derived product that could be considered as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of inflammation-related diseases.","Blazquez, Rebeca; Sanchez-Margallo, Francisco Miguel; de la Rosa, Olga; Dalemans, Wilfried; Álvarez, Verónica; Tarazona, Raquel; Casado, Javier G.",Front Immunol,4,11

Mitochondrial dysfunction is associated with different environmental influences or certain genetic conditions, and can be artificially induced by inhibitors acting at different steps of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC). We found that a short-term (5 h) inhibition of ETC complex III with myxothiazol results in the phosphorylation of translation initiation factor eIF2α and upregulation of mRNA for the activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) and several ATF4-regulated genes. The changes are characteristic for the adaptive integrated stress response (ISR), which is known to be triggered by unfolded proteins, nutrient and metabolic deficiency, and mitochondrial dysfunctions. However, after a prolonged incubation with myxothiazol (13–17 h), levels of ATF4 mRNA and ATF4-regulated transcripts were found substantially suppressed. The suppression was dependent on the p53 response, which is triggered by the impairment of the complex III-dependent de novo biosynthesis of pyrimidines by mitochondrial dihydroorotate dehydrogenase. The initial adaptive induction of ATF4/ISR acted to promote viability of cells by attenuating apoptosis. In contrast, the induction of p53 upon a sustained inhibition of ETC complex III produced a pro-apoptotic effect, which was additionally stimulated by the p53-mediated abrogation of the pro-survival activities of the ISR. Interestingly, a sustained inhibition of ETC complex I by piericidine did not induce the p53 response and stably maintained the pro-survival activation of ATF4/ISR. We conclude that a downregulation of mitochondrial ETC generally induces adaptive pro-survival responses, which are specifically abrogated by the suicidal p53 response triggered by the genetic risks of the pyrimidine nucleotide deficiency.","Evstafieva, A G; Garaeva, A A; Khutornenko, A A; Klepikova, A V; Logacheva, M D; Penin, A A; Novakovsky, G E; Kovaleva, I E; Chumakov, P M",Cell Death Dis,4,8

This mutant contains a single amino acid substitution from histidine to leucine at position 74 (H74L) that is located in the peptide-binding groove. To investigate the effect of the H74L mutation on the in vivo CTL priming, we took advantage of the technology of the HLA class I single-chain trimer (SCT) in which three components involving a peptide, β2 microglobulin and the HLA class I heavy chain are joined together via flexible linkers. We generated recombinant adenovirus expressing SCT comprised influenza A matrix protein (FMP)-derived peptide, β2 microglobulin and the H74L heavy chain. HLA-A*02:01 transgenic mice were immunized with the adenovirus, and the induction of peptide-specific CTLs and antitumor immunity was investigated. It was clearly shown that the H74L mutation enabled the HLA-A*02:01 SCT molecule to dramatically enhance both in vivo priming of FMP-specific CTLs and protection against a lethal challenge of tumor cells expressing FMP. These data present the first evidence that a simple point mutation in the HLA class I heavy chain of SCT is beneficial for improving CTL-based immunotherapy and prophylaxis to control tumors.","Matsui, Masanori; Kawano, Masaaki; Matsushita, Sho; Akatsuka, Toshitaka",Mol Ther Methods Clin Dev,4,1

Clinically, influenza virus and Streptococcus suis co-infections in pigs are very common, which often contribute to severe pneumonia and can increase the mortality. However, the co-infection pathogenesis in pigs is unclear. In the present study, co-infection experiments were performed using swine H1N1 influenza virus and Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (SS2). The H1N1-SS2 co-infected pigs exhibited more severe clinical symptoms, serious pathological changes, and robust apoptosis of lungs at 6 days post-infection compared with separate H1N1 and SS2 infections. A comprehensive gene expression profiling using a microarray approach was performed to investigate the global host responses of swine lungs against the swine H1N1 infection, SS2 infection, co-infection, and phosphate-buffered saline control. Results showed 457, 411, and 844 differentially expressed genes in the H1N1, SS2, and H1N1-SS2 groups, respectively, compared with the control. Noticeably, genes associated with the immune, inflammatory, and apoptosis responses were highly overexpressed in the co-infected group. Pathway analysis indicated that the cytokine–cytokine receptor interactions, MAPK, toll-like receptor, complement and coagulation cascades, antigen processing and presentation, and apoptosis pathway were significantly regulated in the co-infected group. However, the genes related to these were less regulated in the separate H1N1 and SS2 infection groups. This observation suggested that a certain level of synergy was induced by H1N1 and SS2 co-infection with significantly stronger inflammatory and apoptosis responses, which may lead to more serious respiratory disease syndrome and pulmonary pathological lesion.","Lin, Xian; Huang, Canhui; Shi, Jian; Wang, Ruifang; Sun, Xin; Liu, Xiaokun; Zhao, Lianzhong; Jin, Meilin",PLoS One,4,28

In Brazil, SIV has been identified in pigs since 1978. After the emergence of pandemic H1N1 in 2009 (H1N1pdm09), few studies reported the presence of influenza virus in Brazilian herds. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to evaluate the serological profile for influenza virus in farrow-to-finish pig farms in Minas Gerais state, Brazil. METHODS: Thirty farms with no SIV vaccination history were selected from the four larger pig production areas in Minas Gerais state (Zona da Mata, Triângulo Mineiro/Alto Paranaíba, South/Southwest and the Belo Horizonte metropolitan area). At each farm, blood samples were randomly collected from 20 animals in each production cycle category: breeding animals (sows and gilts), farrowing crate (2–3 weeks), nursery (4–7 weeks), grower pigs (8–14 weeks), and finishing pigs (15–16 weeks), with 100 samples per farm and a total of 3000 animals in this study. The samples were tested for hemagglutination inhibition activity against H1N1 pandemic strain (A/swine/Brazil/11/2009) and H3N2 SIV (A/swine/Iowa/8548-2/98) reference strain. RESULTS: The percentages of seropositive animals for H1N1pdm09 and H3N2 were 26·23% and 1·57%, respectively, and the percentages of seropositive herds for both viruses were 96·6% and 13·2%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The serological profiles differed for both viruses and among the studied areas, suggesting a high variety of virus circulation around the state, as well as the presence of seronegative animals susceptible to influenza infection and, consequently, new respiratory disease outbreaks.","Dias, Alessandra S; Costa, Érica A; Rajão, Daniela S; Guedes, Roberto M C; Ciacci Zanella, Janice R; Lobato, Zélia I P",Influenza Other Respir Viruses,4,28

Reflecting their importance for host defense, pathogens encode various countermeasures to evade or inhibit these immune effectors. PRRs directly engaged by pathogen inhibitors often evolve under recurrent bouts of positive selection that have been described as molecular ‘arms races.’ Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) was recently identified as a key PRR. Upon binding cytoplasmic double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) from various viruses, cGAS generates the small nucleotide secondary messenger cGAMP to signal activation of innate defenses. Here we report an evolutionary history of cGAS with recurrent positive selection in the primate lineage. Recent studies indicate a high degree of structural similarity between cGAS and 2’-5’-oligoadenylate synthase 1 (OAS1), a PRR that detects double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), despite low sequence identity between the respective genes. We present comprehensive comparative evolutionary analysis of cGAS and OAS1 primate sequences and observe positive selection at nucleic acid binding interfaces and distributed throughout both genes. Our data revealed homologous regions with strong signatures of positive selection, suggesting common mechanisms employed by unknown pathogen encoded inhibitors and similar modes of evasion from antagonism. Our analysis of cGAS diversification also identified alternately spliced forms missing multiple sites under positive selection. Further analysis of selection on the OAS family in primates, which comprises OAS1, OAS2, OAS3 and OASL, suggests a hypothesis where gene duplications and domain fusion events result in paralogs that provide another means of escaping pathogen inhibitors. Together our comparative evolutionary analysis of cGAS and OAS provides new insights into distinct mechanisms by which key molecular sentinels of the innate immune system have adapted to circumvent viral-encoded inhibitors.","Hancks, Dustin C.; Hartley, Melissa K.; Hagan, Celia; Clark, Nathan L.; Elde, Nels C.",PLoS Genet,4,1

Here, we demonstrate a viral detection strategy based on synthetic biology principles to detect a specific viral function rather than a particular viral protein. The resistance caused by mutations can be circumvented since the mutations that cause the loss of function also incapacitate the virus. Many pathogens encode proteases that are essential for their replication and that have a defined substrate specificity. A genetically encoded sensor composed of a fused membrane anchor, viral protease target site, and an orthogonal transcriptional activator was engineered into a human cell line. The HIV-1 protease released the transcriptional activator from the membrane, thereby inducing transcription of the selected genes. The device was still strongly activated by clinically relevant protease mutants that are resistant to protease inhibitors. In the future, a similar principle could be applied to detect also other pathogens and functions.","Majerle, Andreja; Gaber, Rok; Benčina, Mojca; Jerala, Roman",ACS Synth Biol,4,1

The pore-forming toxin pneumolysin is a key virulence factor of S. pneumoniae, which can be sensed by the NLRP3 inflammasome. Among the over 90 serotypes, serotype 1 pneumococci (particularly MLST306) have emerged across the globe as a major cause of invasive disease. The cause for its particularity is, however, incompletely understood. We therefore examined pneumococcal infection in human cells and a human lung organ culture system mimicking infection of the lower respiratory tract. We demonstrate that different pneumococcal serotypes differentially activate inflammasome-dependent IL-1β production in human lung tissue and cells. Whereas serotype 2, 3, 6B, 9N pneumococci expressing fully haemolytic pneumolysins activate NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent responses, serotype 1 and 8 strains expressing non-haemolytic toxins are poor activators of IL-1β production. Accordingly, purified haemolytic pneumolysin but not serotype 1-associated non-haemolytic toxin activates strong IL-1β production in human lungs.

We have previously shown that P2X7 receptor (P2X7R), a cell death receptor, is specifically expressed in alveolar epithelial type I cells (AEC I). In this study, we hypothesized that P2X7R-mediated purinergic signaling and its interaction with Wnt/β-catenin signaling contributes to AEC I death. We examined the effect of P2X7R agonist 2′-3′-O-(4-benzoylbenzoyl)-ATP (BzATP) and Wnt agonist Wnt3a on AEC I death in vitro and in vivo. We also assessed the therapeutic potential of Wnt3a in a clinically relevant ALI model of intratracheal lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure in ventilated mice. We found that the activation of P2X7R by BzATP caused the death of AEC I by suppressing Wnt/β-catenin signaling through stimulating glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) and proteasome. On the other hand, the activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling by Wnt3a, GSK-3β inhibitor, or proteasome inhibitor blocked the P2X7R-mediated cell death. More importantly, Wnt3a attenuated the AEC I damage caused by intratracheal instillation of BzATP in rats or LPS in ventilated mice. Our results suggest that Wnt3a overrides the effect of P2X7R on the Wnt/β-catenin signaling to prevent the AEC I death and restrict the severity of ALI.","Guo, Y; Mishra, A; Weng, T; Chintagari, N R; Wang, Y; Zhao, C; Huang, C; Liu, L",Cell Death Dis,4,8

OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to identify the presence of antibodies against influenza A virus in dogs and their owners, as well as the presence of RNA of influenza A virus in nasal exudates of dogs and, thereby, assess the possible transmission of the virus between humans and dogs. METHODS: Serum samples from household dogs and their owners were analyzed to detect the presence of antibodies against three subtypes of human influenza virus (H1N1pdm09, H1N1, and H3N2), as well as subtype H3N8 of equine influenza. We analyzed dog nasal exudates to detect influenza viral RNA. The relationship between the seropositivity of dogs and various factors (age, sex, constantly at home, and seropositivity of owners) was statistically analyzed. RESULTS: Seroprevalence for human influenza in dogs was 0·9% (1 of 113), and it was 4% (5 of 113) for equine influenza. In humans, seroprevalence was 22% for subtype H1N1pdm09, 20% for subtype H1N1, and 11% for subtype H3N2. No significant association (P > 0·05) was found between seropositivity and any of the assessed factors. Furthermore, no viral RNA was detected in the nasal exudate samples. CONCLUSIONS: Results revealed seroprevalence of the influenza virus in household dogs in Mexico City. It can be assumed that dogs are currently becoming infected with different subtypes of influenza viruses.","Ramírez‐Martínez, Luis A.; Contreras‐Luna, María; De la Luz, Jazmín; Manjarrez, María E.; Rosete, Dora P.; Rivera‐Benitez, José F.; Saavedra‐Montañez, Manuel; Ramírez‐Mendoza, Humberto",Influenza Other Respir Viruses,4,28
2016,2016,2016,Prior infection of pigs with a recent human H3N2 influenza virus confers minimal cross‐protection against a European swine H3N2 virus,11.609381,7.966554,2013-03-29,"BACKGROUND: H3N2 influenza viruses circulating in humans and European pigs originate from the pandemic A/Hong Kong/68 virus. Because of slower antigenic drift in swine, the antigenic divergence between swine and human viruses has been increasing. It remains unknown to what extent this results in a reduced cross‐protection between recent human and swine H3N2 influenza viruses. OBJECTIVES: We examined whether prior infection of pigs with an old [A/Victoria/3/75 (A/Vic/75)] or a more recent [A/Wisconsin/67/05 (A/Wis/05)] human H3N2 virus protected against a European swine H3N2 virus [sw/Gent/172/08 (sw/Gent/08)]. Genetic and antigenic relationships between sw/Gent/08 and a selection of human H3N2 viruses were also assessed. RESULTS: After challenge with sw/Gent/08, all challenge controls had high virus titers in the entire respiratory tract at 3 days post‐challenge and nasal virus excretion for 5–6 days. Prior infection with sw/Gent/08 or A/Vic/75 offered complete virological protection against challenge. Pigs previously inoculated with A/Wis/05 showed similar virus titers in the respiratory tract as challenge controls, but the mean duration of nasal shedding was 1·3 days shorter. Unlike sw/Gent/08‐ and A/Vic/75‐inoculated pigs, A/Wis/05‐inoculated pigs lacked cross‐reactive neutralizing antibodies against sw/Gent/08 before challenge, but they showed a more rapid antibody response to sw/Gent/08 than challenge controls after challenge. Cross‐protection and serological responses correlated with genetic and antigenic differences. CONCLUSIONS: Infection immunity to a recent human H3N2 virus confers minimal cross‐protection against a European swine H3N2 virus. We discuss our findings with regard to the recent zoonotic infections of humans in the United States with a swine‐origin H3N2 variant virus.","Qiu, Yu; van der Meulen, Karen; Van Reeth, Kristien",Influenza Other Respir Viruses,4,28

Based on our previous finding that avian influenza viral RNA and proteins were present in the nucleus of infected human neutrophils in vivo, we investigated the possibility of 2009 A (H1N1) influenza viral synthesis in infected neutrophils and possible release of infectious progeny from host cells. In this study we found that human neutrophils in vitro without detectable level of sialic acid expression could be infected by this virus strain. We also show that the infected neutrophils can not only synthesize 2009 A (H1N1) viral mRNA and proteins, but also produce infectious progeny. These findings suggest that infectious progeny of 2009 A (H1N1) influenza virus could be replicated in and released from human neutrophils with possible clinical implications.","Zhang, Zhang; Huang, Tao; Yu, Feiyuan; Liu, Xingmu; Zhao, Conghui; Chen, Xueling; Kelvin, David J.; Gu, Jiang",Sci Rep,4,28

However, whether H7N9 and H5N1 infections correlate with climate factors has not been examined. Here, we analyzed 350 cases of H7N9 infection and 47 cases of H5N1 infection. The spatial characteristics of these cases revealed that H5N1 infections mainly occurred in the South, Middle, and Northwest of China, while the occurrence of H7N9 was concentrated in coastal areas of East and South of China. Aside from spatial-temporal characteristics, the most adaptive meteorological conditions for the occurrence of human infections by these two viral subtypes were different. We found that H7N9 infections correlate with climate factors, especially temperature (TEM) and relative humidity (RHU), while H5N1 infections correlate with TEM and atmospheric pressure (PRS). Hence, we propose a risky window (TEM 4–14 °C and RHU 65–95%) for H7N9 infection and (TEM 2–22 °C and PRS 980-1025 kPa) for H5N1 infection. Our results represent the first step in determining the effects of climate factors on two different virus infections in China and provide warning guidelines for the future when provinces fall into the risky windows. These findings revealed integrated predictive meteorological factors rooted in statistic data that enable the establishment of preventive actions and precautionary measures against future outbreaks.","Li, Jing; Rao, Yuhan; Sun, Qinglan; Wu, Xiaoxu; Jin, Jiao; Bi, Yuhai; Chen, Jin; Lei, Fumin; Liu, Qiyong; Duan, Ziyuan; Ma, Juncai; Gao, George F.; Liu, Di; Liu, Wenjun",Sci Rep,4,11

Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) has been identified as an enzyme associated with immunoregulatory function. Although the regulatory role of IDO in viral replication has been postulated, the in vivo role of IDO activity has not been fully addressed in neurotropic virus-caused encephalitis. METHODS: Mice in which IDO activity was inhibited by genetic ablation or using a specific inhibitor were examined for mortality and clinical signs after infection. Neuroinflammation was evaluated by central nervous system (CNS) infiltration of leukocytes and cytokine expression. IDO expression, viral burden, JEV-specific T-cell, and type I/II interferon (IFN-I/II) innate responses were also analyzed. RESULTS: Elevated expression of IDO activity in myeloid and neuron cells of the lymphoid and CNS tissues was closely associated with clinical signs of JE. Furthermore, inhibition of IDO activity enhanced resistance to JE, reduced the viral burden in lymphoid and CNS tissues, and resulted in early and increased CNS infiltration by Ly-6C(hi) monocytes, NK, CD4(+), and CD8(+) T-cells. JE amelioration in IDO-ablated mice was also associated with enhanced NK and JEV-specific T-cell responses. More interestingly, IDO ablation induced rapid enhancement of type I IFN (IFN-I) innate responses in CD11c(+) dendritic cells (DCs), including conventional and plasmacytoid DCs, following JEV infection. This enhanced IFN-I innate response in IDO-ablated CD11c(+) DCs was coupled with strong induction of PRRs (RIG-I, MDA5), transcription factors (IRF7, STAT1), and antiviral ISG genes (Mx1, Mx2, ISG49, ISG54, ISG56). IDO ablation also enhanced the IFN-I innate response in neuron cells, which may delay the spread of virus in the CNS. Finally, we identified that IDO ablation in myeloid cells derived from hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) dominantly contributed to JE amelioration and that HSC-derived leukocytes played a key role in the enhanced IFN-I innate responses in the IDO-ablated environment. CONCLUSIONS: Inhibition of IDO activity ameliorated JE via enhancement of antiviral IFN-I/II innate and adaptive T-cell responses and increased CNS infiltration of peripheral leukocytes. Therefore, our data provide valuable insight into the use of IDO inhibition by specific inhibitors as a promising tool for therapeutic and prophylactic strategies against viral encephalitis caused by neurotropic viruses.","Kim, Seong Bum; Choi, Jin Young; Uyangaa, Erdenebileg; Patil, Ajit Mahadev; Hossain, Ferdaus Mohd Altaf; Hur, Jin; Park, Sang-Youel; Lee, John-Hwa; Kim, Koanhoi; Eo, Seong Kug",J Neuroinflammation,4,8
2205,2205,2205,Altered microRNA expression and pre-mRNA splicing events reveal new mechanisms associated with early stage Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis infection,11.868251,7.7422338,2016-04-22,"The molecular regulatory mechanisms of host responses to Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) infection during the early subclinical stage are still not clear. In this study, surgically isolated ileal segments in newborn calves (n = 5) were used to establish in vivo MAP infection adjacent to an uninfected control intestinal compartment. RNA-Seq was used to profile the whole transcriptome (mRNAs) and the microRNAome (miRNAs) of ileal tissues collected at one-month post-infection. The most related function of the differentially expressed mRNAs between infected and uninfected tissues was “proliferation of endothelial cells”, indicating that MAP infection may lead to the over-proliferation of endothelial cells. In addition, 46.2% of detected mRNAs displayed alternative splicing events. The pre-mRNA of two genes related to macrophage maturation (monocyte to macrophage differentiation-associated) and lysosome function (adenosine deaminase) showed differential alternative splicing events, suggesting that specific changes in the pre-mRNA splicing sites may be a mechanism by which MAP escapes host immune responses. Moreover, 9 miRNAs were differentially expressed after MAP infection. The integrated analysis of microRNAome and transcriptome revealed that these miRNAs might regulate host responses to MAP infection, such as “proliferation of endothelial cells” (bta-miR-196 b), “bacteria recognition” (bta-miR-146 b), and “regulation of the inflammatory response” (bta-miR-146 b).","Liang, Guanxiang; Malmuthuge, Nilusha; Guan, Yongjuan; Ren, Yuwei; Griebel, Philip J.; Guan, Le Luo",Sci Rep,4,1

The current status in many countries is to prepare influenza vaccine using cell-based or egg-based killed vaccine. However, traditional influenza vaccine platforms have several limitations. To overcome these limitations, many researchers have tried various approaches to develop alternative production platforms. One of the alternative approach, we reported the efficacy of influenza HA vaccination using a baculoviral DNA vaccine (AcHERV-HA). However, the immune response elicited by the AcHERV-HA vaccine, which only targets the HA antigen, was lower than that of the commercial killed vaccine. To overcome the limitations of this previous vaccine, we constructed a human endogenous retrovirus (HERV) envelope-coated, baculovirus-based, virus-like-particle (VLP)–forming DNA vaccine (termed AcHERV-VLP) against pandemic influenza A/California/04/2009 (pH1N1). BALB/c mice immunized with AcHERV-VLP (1×10(7) FFU AcHERV-VLP, i.m.) and compared with mice immunized with the killed vaccine or mice immunized with AcHERV-HA. As a result, AcHERV-VLP immunization produced a greater humoral immune response and exhibited neutralizing activity with an intrasubgroup H1 strain (PR8), elicited neutralizing antibody production, a high level of interferon-γ secretion in splenocytes, and diminished virus shedding in the lung after challenge with a lethal dose of influenza virus. In conclusion, VLP-forming baculovirus DNA vaccine could be a potential vaccine candidate capable of efficiently delivering DNA to the vaccinee and VLP forming DNA eliciting stronger immunogenicity than egg-based killed vaccines.","Gwon, Yong-Dae; Kim, Sehyun; Cho, Yeondong; Heo, Yoonki; Cho, Hansam; Park, Kihoon; Lee, Hee-Jung; Choi, Jiwon; Poo, Haryoung; Kim, Young Bong",PLoS One,4,28

Extensive sequence variability within and between RSV group A and B viruses and the ability of multiple clades and sub-clades of RSV to co-circulate are likely mechanisms contributing to the evasion of herd immunity. Surveillance and large-scale whole-genome sequencing of RSV is currently limited but would help identify its evolutionary dynamics and sites of selective immune evasion. In this study, we performed complete-genome next-generation sequencing of 92 RSV isolates from infants in central Tennessee during the 2012–2014 RSV seasons. We identified multiple co-circulating clades of RSV from both the A and B groups. Each clade is defined by signature N- and O-linked glycosylation patterns. Analyses of specific RSV genes revealed high rates of positive selection in the attachment (G) gene. We identified RSV-A viruses in circulation with and without a recently reported 72-nucleotide G gene sequence duplication. Furthermore, we show evidence of convergent evolution of G gene sequence duplication and fixation over time, which suggests a potential fitness advantage of RSV with the G sequence duplication.","Schobel, Seth A.; Stucker, Karla M.; Moore, Martin L.; Anderson, Larry J.; Larkin, Emma K.; Shankar, Jyoti; Bera, Jayati; Puri, Vinita; Shilts, Meghan H.; Rosas-Salazar, Christian; Halpin, Rebecca A.; Fedorova, Nadia; Shrivastava, Susmita; Stockwell, Timothy B.; Peebles, R.

Since the precise mechanism of the innate immune response induced by ALV-J is unknown, we investigated the antiviral innate immune responses induced by ALV-J in chicks and chickens that had developed tumors. Spleen levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-10, IL-1β, and interferon-β (IFN-β) were not significantly different between the infected chick groups and the control groups from 1 day post hatch to 7 days post hatch. However, IL-6, IL-1β, and IFN-β protein levels in the three clinical samples with hemangiomas were dramatically increased compared to the healthy samples. In addition, the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 increased sharply in two of three clinical samples. We also found a more than 20-fold up-regulation of ISG12-1 mRNA at 1 day post infection (d.p.i.) and a twofold up-regulation of ZC3HAV1 mRNA at 4 d.p.i. However, there were no statistical differences in ISG12-1 and ZC3HAV1 mRNA expression levels in the tumorigenesis phase. ALV-J infection induced a significant increase of Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR-7) at 1 d.p.i. and dramatically increased the mRNA levels of melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) in the tumorigenesis phase. Moreover, the protein levels of interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) were decreased in chickens with tumors. These results suggest that ALV-J was primarily recognized by chicken TLR7 and MDA5 at early and late in vivo infection stages, respectively. ALV-J strain SCAU-HN06 did not induce any significant antiviral innate immune response in 1 week old chicks. However, interferon-stimulated genes were not induced normally during the late phase of ALV-J infection due to a reduction of IRF1 and STAT1 expression.","Feng, Min; Dai, Manman; Xie, Tingting; Li, Zhenhui; Shi, Meiqing; Zhang, Xiquan",Front Microbiol,4,1

Genetic and phylogenetic analyses revealed that the virus belonged to a novel genotype, which probably emerged and further reassorted with other H9 or H7 viruses in poultry before transmitting to humans. This virus caused a severe infection with high levels of cytokines and neutralizing antibodies. Eventually, the patient was cured after serially combined treatments. Taken together, our findings indicated that this novel genotype of the human H7N9 virus did not evolve directly from the first Beijing isolate A/Beijing/01/2013(H7N9), suggesting that the H7N9 virus has not obtained the ability for human-to-human transmissibility and the virus only evolves in poultry and then infects human by direct contact. Hence, the major measures to prevent human H7N9 virus infection are still to control and standardize the live poultry trade. Early antiviral treatment with combination therapies, including mechanical ventilation, nutrition support and symptomatic treatment, are effective for H7N9 infection.","Bi, Yuhai; Liu, Jingyuan; Xiong, Haofeng; Zhang, Yue; Liu, Di; Liu, Yingxia; Gao, George F.; Wang, Beibei",Sci Rep,4,28

While local infection often remains asymptomatic, severe or even fatal diseases occur when streptococci become invasive and spread to different sites in the infected host. We have established porcine respiratory air-liquid interface cultures (ALI) from the porcine lung to analyze the interaction of streptococci with their primary target cells. As representative of the streptococcal family we chose Streptococcus suis (S. suis) that is not only a major swine respiratory pathogen but can also infect humans. Suilysin, a cholesterol-dependent cytolysin (CDC), is an important virulence factor. By comparing a S. suis wt strain with a suilysin-deficient mutant, we demonstrate that suilysin contributes to (i) adherence to airway cells (ii) loss of ciliated cells (iii) apoptosis, and (iv) invasion. Furthermore, we show that cytolytic activity of suilysin is crucial for these effects. A striking result of our analysis was the high efficiency of S. suis-induced apoptosis and invasion upon infection under ALI conditions. These properties have been reported to be less efficient when analyzed with immortalized cells. We hypothesize that soluble effectors such as suilysin are present at higher concentrations in cells kept at ALI conditions and thus more effective. These results should be relevant also for infection of the respiratory tract by other respiratory pathogens.","Meng, Fandan; Wu, Nai-Huei; Seitz, Maren; Herrler, Georg; Valentin-Weigand, Peter",Sci Rep,4,1

Canine influenza virus (CIV) H3N2 is a virus that can infect companion animals and is, therefore, a potential public health concern. Objective This study investigated the inter‐ and intraspecies transmission of CIV among dogs, cats, and ferrets, under laboratory conditions, to determine whether transmission of the virus was possible between as well as within these domestic animal species. Method The transmission routes for inter‐ and intraspecies transmission were airborne and direct contact, respectively. Transmission was conducted through intranasal infection of dogs followed by exposure to either cats or ferrets and by comingling infected and naïve animals of the same species. Results The interspecies transmission of CIV H3N2 via airborne was only observed from dogs to cats and not from dogs to ferrets. However, direct intranasal infection of either cats or ferrets with CIV could induce influenza‐like clinical signs, viral shedding, and serological responses. Additionally, naïve cats and ferrets could be infected by CIV via direct contact with infected animals of the same species. Conclusion Cats appear to be another susceptible host of CIV H3N2, whereas ferrets are not likely natural hosts.

In Thailand, there has been a little information on the molecular characteristics of the SIVs since the first isolation of viruses of H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes in the late 1970s. Our previous study demonstrated that Thai H1N1 SIVs possessed the classical swine H1 and avian‐like swine N1 genes (Takemae et al., Proceedings of the Options for the Control of Influenza VI.2007;350–353). Objectives In the present study, we genetically characterized 12 SIVs including those of H1N1, H1N2 and H3N2 subtypes isolated between 2000 and 2005. Methods We determined the entire nucleotide sequences of the eight gene segments of those isolates. Results Phylogenetic analysis revealed the existence of nine distinct genotypes amongst the Thai SIVs. These genotypes arose from multiple introductions of classical swine, avian‐like swine and human viruses. The existence of two distinct sublineages within classical swine H1 and NS, avian‐like swine PA and M and human H3 and N2 genes of the Thai SIVs suggested that introduction of viruses of classical swine, avian‐like swine and human origins occurred twice respectively into the Thai pig population. The predominance of avian‐like swine genes amongst the Thai SIVs was evident. In particular, three polymerase (PB1, PB2 and PA) and matrix genes of avian‐like swine origin were retained in all the Thai SIVs examined. Conclusions These observations may suggest that genes of avian‐like swine lineages have some advantages to be maintained in pigs as seen in the SIVs established through multiple introductions in other regions.","Takemae, Nobuhiro; Parchariyanon, Sujira; Damrongwatanapokin, Sudarat; Uchida, Yuko; Ruttanapumma, Ruttapong; Watanabe, Chiaki; Yamaguchi, Shigeo; Saito, Takehiko",Influenza Other Respir Viruses,4,1

Background The new influenza virus A/H1N1 (2009), identified in mid‐2009, rapidly spread over the world. Estimating the transmissibility of this new virus was a public health priority. Methods We reviewed all studies presenting estimates of the serial interval or generation time and the reproduction number of the A/H1N1 (2009) virus infection. Results Thirteen studies documented the serial interval from household or close‐contact studies, with overall mean 3 days (95% CI: 2·4, 3·6); taking into account tertiary transmission reduced this estimate to 2·6 days. Model‐based estimates were more variable, from 1·9 to 6 days. Twenty‐four studies reported reproduction numbers for community‐based epidemics at the town or country level. The range was 1·2–3·1, with larger estimates reported at the beginning of the pandemic. Accounting for under‐reporting in the early period of the pandemic and limiting variation because of the choice of the generation time interval, the reproduction number was between 1·2 and 2·3 with median 1·5. Discussion The serial interval of A/H1N1 (2009) flu was typically short, with mean value similar to the seasonal flu. The estimates of the reproduction number were more variable.

We previously reported that adenovirus vectored vaccines are potent in priming Ab responses, but uncertainty remains regarding the optimal approach for induction of humoral immune responses. In this study, using OVA as a model Ag, we assessed the magnitude of the primary and anamnestic Ag–specific IgG responses of mice to four clinically relevant vaccine formulations: replication-deficient adenovirus; modified vaccinia Ankara (a poxvirus); protein with alum; and protein in the squalene oil-in-water adjuvant Addavax. We then used flow cytometric assays capable of measuring total and Ag-specific germinal center (GC) B cell and follicular Th cell responses to compare the induction of these responses by the different formulations. We report that adenovirus vectored vaccines induce Ag insert–specific GC B cell and Ab responses of a magnitude comparable to those induced by a potent protein/squalene oil-in-water formulation whereas—despite a robust overall GC response—the insert-specific GC B cell and Ab responses induced by modified vaccinia Ankara were extremely weak. Ag-specific follicular Th cell responses to adenovirus vectored vaccines exceeded those induced by other platforms at day 7 after immunization. We found little evidence that innate immune activation by adenovirus may act as an adjuvant in such a manner that the humoral response to a recombinant protein may be enhanced by coadministering with an adenovirus lacking a transgene of interest. Overall, these studies provide further support for the use of replication-deficient adenoviruses to induce humoral responses.","Wang, Chuan; Hart, Matthew; Chui, Cecilia; Ajuogu, Augustine; Brian, Iona J.; de Cassan, Simone C.; Borrow, Persephone; Draper, Simon J.; Douglas, Alexander D.",J Immunol,4,8

Some lymphomas have a very rapid fulminant course. HHV-8 has also been reported to be a cause of lymphoma. The role of CMV in the development of lymphoma is not clear, though both CMV and HHV-8 have been reported in tissues adjacent to the tumour in Burkitt lymphoma patients. Here we present a patient with asymptomatic HIV infection, that contracted a primary cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and human herpes virus 8 (HHV-8) infection. Three weeks before onset of symptoms the patient had unprotected sex which could be possible source of his CMV and also HHV-8 infection He deteriorated rapidly and died with a generalized anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL). METHODS: A Caucasian homosexual male with asymptomatic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection contracted a primary cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and human herpes virus 8 (HHV-8) infection. He deteriorated rapidly and died with a generalized anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL). Clinical and laboratory records were compiled. Immunohistochemistry was performed on lymphoid tissues, a liver biopsy, a bone marrow aspirate and the spleen during the illness and at autopsy. Serology and PCR for HIV, CMV, EBV, HHV-1–3 and 6–8 was performed on blood drawn during the course of disease. RESULTS: The patient presented with an acute primary CMV infection. Biopsies taken 2 weeks before death showed a small focus of ALCL in one lymph node of the neck. Autopsy demonstrated a massive infiltration of ALCL in lymph nodes, liver, spleen and bone marrow. Blood samples confirmed primary CMV- infection, a HHV-8 infection together with reactivation of Epstein- Barr-virus (EBV). CONCLUSION: Primary CMV-infection and concomitant HHV-8 infection correlated with reactivation of EBV. We propose that these two viruses influenced the development and progression of the lymphoma. Quantitative PCR blood analysis for EBV, CMV and HHV-8 could be valuable in diagnosis and treatment of this type of very rapidly developing lymphoma. It is also a reminder of the importance of prevention and prophylaxis of several infections by having protected sex.","Grützmeier, Sven; Porwit, Anna; Schmitt, Corinna; Sandström, Eric; Åkerlund, Börje; Ernberg, Ingemar",Infect Agent Cancer,4,28

RESULTS: The expression of autophagy related genes ATG5, ATG12, ATG9A and ATG4B expression was analyzed in HepG2.2.15 cells and compared with HepG2 and THLE cells. We found that ATG5 and ATG12 mRNA expression was significantly increased in HepG2.2.15 cells compared to HepG2 cells (P < 0.005). Moreover, ATG5-ATG12 protein levels were increased in tumor liver tissues compared to adjacent non-tumor tissues mainly from HCC patients with HBV infection. We also analyzed the function of ATG12 in cell apoptosis and cell cycle progression. The percentage of apoptotic cells increased by 11.4% in ATG12-silenced HepG2.2.15 cells (P < 0.005) but did not change in ATG12-silenced HepG2 cells under starvation with Earle’s balanced salt solution. However, the combination blockade of Notch signaling and ATG12 decreased the apoptotic rate of HepG2.2.15 cells from 55.6% to 50.4% (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: ATG12 is important for HBV-associated apoptosis and a potential drug target for HBV-HCC. Combination inhibition of ATG12/Notch signaling had no additional effect on HepG2.2.15 apoptosis.","Kunanopparat, Areerat; Kimkong, Ingorn; Palaga, Tanapat; Tangkijvanich, Pisit; Sirichindakul, Boonchoo; Hirankarn, Nattiya",World J Gastroenterol,4,28

Amino acid substitutions in PB2 protein were shown to influence the pathogenicity and transmissibility of H7N9 following experimental infection of ferrets and mice. In this study, we evaluated the role of amino acid substitution PB2-627K or compensatory changes at PB2-591K and PB2-701N, on the tropism and replication competence of H7N9 viruses for human and swine respiratory tracts using ex vivo organ explant cultures. Recombinant viruses of A/Shanghai/2/2013 (rgH7N9) and its mutants with PB2-K627E, PB2-K627E + Q591K and PB2-K627E + D701N were generated by plasmid-based reverse genetics. PB2-E627K was essential for efficient replication of rgH7N9 in ex vivo cultures of human and swine respiratory tracts. Mutant rgPB2-K627E + D701N replicated better than rgPB2-K627E in human lung but not as well as rgH7N9 virus. The rgPB2-K627E mutant failed to replicate in human type I-like pneumocytes (ATI) and peripheral blood monocyte-derived macrophages (PMϕ) at 37 °C while the compensatory mutant rgPB2-K627E + Q591K and rgPB2-K627E + D701N had partly restored replication competence in PMϕ. Our results demonstrate that PB2-E627K was important for efficient replication of influenza H7N9 in both human and swine respiratory tracts.","Chan, Louisa L. Y.; Bui, Christine T. H.; Mok, Chris K.

2480,2480,2480,Regulation and Maintenance of an Adoptive T-Cell Dependent Memory B Cell Pool,11.801951,7.7649107,2016-11-23,"We investigated the ability of monoclonal B cells to restore primary and secondary T-cell dependent antibody responses in adoptive immune-deficient hosts. Priming induced B cell activation and expansion, AID expression, antibody production and the generation of IgM(+)IgG(-) and IgM(-)IgG(+) antigen-experienced B-cell subsets that persisted in the lymphopenic environment by cell division. Upon secondary transfer and recall the IgM(-)IgG(+) cells responded by the production of antigen-specific IgG while the IgM(+) memory cells secreted mainly IgM and little IgG, but generated new B cells expressing germinal center markers. The recall responses were more efficient if the antigenic boost was delayed suggesting that a period of adaptation is necessary before the transferred cells are able to respond. Overall these findings indicate that reconstitution of a functional and complete memory pool requires transfer of all different antigen-experienced B cell subsets. We also found that the size of the memory B cell pool did not rely on the number of the responding naïve B cells, suggesting autonomous homeostatic controls for naïve and memory B cells. By reconstituting a stable memory B cell pool in immune-deficient hosts using a monoclonal high-affinity B cell population we demonstrate the potential value of B cell adoptive immunotherapy.","Anson, Marie; Amado, Inês; Mailhé, Marie-Pierre; Donnadieu, Emmanuel; Garcia, Sylvie; Huetz, François; Freitas, Antonio A.",PLoS One,4,8

Thus, therapeutic control of the TLR4 signalling pathway is of major interest. Here we tested the activity of the small-molecule synthetic TLR4 antagonist, FP7, in vitro on human monocytes and monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs) and in vivo during influenza virus infection of mice. Our results indicate that FP7 antagonized the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, and MIP-1β) by monocytes and DCs (IC(50) < 1 μM) and prevented DC maturation upon TLR4 activation by ultrapure lipopolysaccharide (LPS). FP7 selectively blocked TLR4 stimulation, but not TLR1/2, TLR2/6, or TLR3 activation. TLR4 stimulation of human DCs resulted in increased glycolytic activity that was also antagonized by FP7. FP7 protected mice from influenza virus-induced lethality and reduced both proinflammatory cytokine gene expression in the lungs and acute lung injury (ALI). Therefore, FP7 can antagonize TLR4 activation in vitro and protect mice from severe influenza infection, most likely by reducing TLR4-dependent cytokine storm mediated by damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) like HMGB1.","Perrin-Cocon, Laure; Aublin-Gex, Anne; Sestito, Stefania E.; Shirey, Kari Ann; Patel, Mira C.; André, Patrice; Blanco, Jorge C.; Vogel, Stefanie N.; Peri, Francesco; Lotteau, Vincent",Sci Rep,4,1

Our findings indicate a high outbreak attack rate of 33% among poultry but a low rate of chicken-to-human spillover transmission. In addition, we generated accurate forecasts of the peak timing and magnitude of human influenza A(H7N9) cases. This work demonstrates that transmission dynamics within an avian reservoir can be estimated and that real-time forecast of spillover avian influenza in humans is possible.","Li, Ruiyun; Bai, Yuqi; Heaney, Alex; Kandula, Sasikiran; Cai, Jun; Zhao, Xuyi; Xu, Bing; Shaman, Jeffrey",Euro Surveill,4,8
2680,2680,2680,Transmission patterns and evolution of respiratory syncytial virus in a community outbreak identified by genomic analysis,11.615377,8.151873,2017-03-11,"Detailed information on the source, spread and evolution of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) during seasonal community outbreaks remains sparse. Molecular analyses of attachment (G) gene sequences from hospitalized cases suggest that multiple genotypes and variants co-circulate during epidemics and that RSV persistence over successive seasons is characterized by replacement and multiple new introductions of variants. No studies have defined the patterns of introduction, spread and evolution of RSV at the local community and household level. We present a whole genome sequence analysis of 131 RSV group A viruses collected during 6-month household-based RSV infection surveillance in Coastal Kenya, 2010 within an area of 12 km(2). RSV infections were identified by regular symptom-independent screening of all household members twice weekly. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the RSV A viruses in nine households were closely related to genotype GA2 and fell within a single branch of the global phylogeny. Genomic analysis allowed the detection of household-specific variation in seven households. For comparison, using only G gene analysis, household-specific variation was found only in one of the nine households. Nucleotide changes were observed both intra-host (viruses identified from same individual in follow-up sampling) and inter-host (viruses identified from different household members) and these coupled with sampling dates enabled a partial reconstruction of the within household transmission chains. The genomic evolutionary rate for the household dataset was estimated as 2.307 × 10 (−) (3) (95% highest posterior density: 0.935–4.165× 10 (−) (3)) substitutions/site/year. We conclude that (i) at the household level, most RSV infections arise from the introduction of a single virus variant followed by accumulation of household specific variation and (ii) analysis of complete virus genomes is crucial to better understand viral transmission in the community. A key question arising is whether prevention of RSV introduction or spread within the household by vaccinating key transmitting household members would lead to a reduced onward community-wide transmission.","Agoti, Charles N.; Munywoki, Patrick K.; Phan, My V.

Three of the four patients had a history of exposure to live poultry or contaminated environments. The complete genome sequences of the H7N9 viruses from the same family cluster were highly homologous, and the four isolated viruses from the two family clusters exhibited the virologic features of the H7N9 virus, in terms of transmissibility, pathogenicity, host adaptation, and antiviral drug resistance. In addition, our findings indicated that the A/Fujian/18/2015 viral strain contained an additional hemagglutinin G225D substitution, which preferentially binds α2,6-linked sialic acids.

The emergence of resistance to anti-influenza drugs underlines the need to develop new drugs. This study aimed to evaluate the anti-influenza viral activity and possible mechanisms of 12 phenanthrenes from the medicinal plant Bletilla striata (Orchidaceae family). METHODS: Twelve phenanthrenes were isolated and identified from B. striata. Influenza virus A/Sydney/5/97 (H3N2) propagated in embryonated chicken eggs was used. Phenanthrenes mixed with the virus were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h and then inoculated into 9-day-old embryonated chicken eggs via the allantoic route to survey the antiviral activity in vivo. A (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H–tetrazolium) (MTS)-based assay was performed to evaluate the reduction of cytopathic effect induced by H3N2 on Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. The hemagglutination inhibition assay was used to study the blockage of virus receptors by the phenanthrenes, and the neuraminidase (NA) inhibition assay to evaluate the effects of the release of virus. The synthesis of influenza viral matrix protein mRNA in response to compound treatment was measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: This study showed that phenanthrenes 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 10, 11, and 12 significantly inhibited the viruses in vivo, with inhibition rates of 20.7, 79.3, 17.2, 34.5, 34.5, 34.5, 44.8, 75.9, and 34.5%, respectively. In MDCK models, the phenanthrenes did not show significant antiviral activity when administered as pretreatment, while phenanthrenes 2, 3, 4, 6, 7 10, and 11 exhibited inhibitory activities as simultaneous treatment with 50% inhibition concentration (IC(50)) ranging from 14.6 ± 2.4 to 43.3 ± 5.3 μM. The IC(50) ranged from 18.4 ± 3.1 to 42.3 ± 3.9 μM in the post-treatment assays. Compounds 1, 3, 4, 6, 10, and 11 exhibited an inhibitory effect on NA; and compounds 2, 3, 4 6, 7, 10, and 11 resulted in the reduced transcription of virus matrix protein mRNA. However, no compound could inhibit hemagglutination by the influenza virus. CONCLUSION: Phenanthrenes from B. striata had strong anti-influenza viral activity in both embryonated eggs and MDCK models, and diphenanthrenes seemed to have stronger inhibition activity compared with monophenanthrenes.

Amino acid changes at the residues 591, 627 and 701 of polymerase basic protein 2 (PB2) have been found frequently in the human H7N9 isolates but not in viruses isolated from avian species. We have recently identified a cluster of H7N9 viruses in ducks which circulated in China prior to the first recognition of zoonotic disease in 2013. These duck viruses have genetic background distinct from the zoonotic H7N9 lineage. We found that the introduction of PB2 mutation with K at 627 but not K at 591 or N at 701 to the duck H7N9 virus led to increased pathogenicity in mice. We also found that the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNF-α, IP-10, MCP-1 and MIP-1α were associated with increased severity of infection. We conclude that introduction of the mammalian adaptation mutations into the PB2 gene of duck H7N9 viruses, which are genetically unrelated to the zoonotic H7N9 lineage, can also enhance pathogenicity in mice.","Li, Weixuan; Lee, Horace Hok Yeung; Li, Run Feng; Zhu, Huachen Maria; Yi, Guan; Peiris, Joseph Sriyal Malik; Yang, Zi Feng; Mok, Chris Ka Pun",Sci Rep,4,28

We evaluated the infection and tropism of human and avian H9 influenza virus in the human respiratory tract using ex vivo respiratory organ culture. H9 viruses infected the upper and lower respiratory tract and the majority of H9 viruses had a decreased ability to release virus from the bronchus rather than the lung. This may be attributed to a weak neuraminidase (NA) cleavage of carbon-6-linked sialic acid (Sia) rather than carbon-3-linked Sia. The modified cleavage of N-acetlylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) and N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) by NA in H9 virus replication was observed by reverse genetics, and recombinant H9N2 viruses with amino acids (38KQ) deleted in the NA stalk, and changing the amino acid at position 431 from Proline-to-Lysine. Using recombinant H9 viruses previously evaluated in the ferret, we found that viruses which replicated well in the ferret did not replicate to the same extent in the human ex vivo cultures. The existing risk assessment models for H9N2 viruses in ferrets may not always have a strong correlation with the replication in the human upper respiratory tract.

However, the therapeutic efficiency depends on the proliferation and migration of MSCs. Chemokine receptors are involved in regulating the proliferation and migration to the specific organs of MSCs in different microenvironments. CXC receptor seven (CXCR7), a newly discovered Chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12) receptor, has organ specificity for tumour migration. We hypothesized that CXCR7 expression affects proliferation and migration of MSCs. In present study, we constructed long-term and stable mMSCs lines overexpressing and suppressing CXCR7 modifications with lentiviral vectors. The transduction efficiencies, mRNA and protein expression of CXCR7 were significantly regulated. CXCR7 gene overexpression promoted mMSCs proliferation and migration, whereas suppressing CXCR7 had the opposite effect. Additional CXCL12 improved the vertical migration of mMSCs. The overexpression of CXCR7 increased the MSC-secreted CXCL12, VCAM-1, CD44 and MMP2 levels, which contributed to the improvement of mMSC proliferation and migration. Therefore, overexpressing CXCR7 improved the proliferation and migration of mMSCs, which may be attributable to the CXCL12 secreted by MSCs, leading to a positive feedback loop for CXCL12/CXCR7 axis. Our results may provide a potential method for improving the treatment effectiveness of mMSCs by overexpressing CXCR7.","Liu, Ling; Chen, Jian-Xiao; Zhang, Xi-Wen; Sun, Qin; Yang, Lan; Liu, Airan; Hu, Shuling; Guo, Fengmei; Liu, Songqiao; Huang, Yingzi; Yang, Yi; Qiu, Hai-Bo",Sci Rep,4,8
3005,3005,3005,Development and Validation of a Serologic Test Panel for Detection of Powassan Virus Infection in U.S. Patients Residing in Regions Where Lyme Disease Is Endemic,12.015048,7.9631867,2018-01-10,"Powassan virus (POWV) is an emerging tick-borne arbovirus presenting a public health threat in North America. POWV lineage II, also known as deer tick virus, is the strain of the virus most frequently found in Ixodes scapularis ticks and is implicated in most cases of POWV encephalitis in the United States. Currently, no commercial tests are available to detect POWV exposure in tick-borne disease (TBD) patients. We describe here the development and analytical validation of a serologic test panel to detect POWV infections. The panel uses an indirect enzyme immunoassay (EIA) to screen. EIA-positive samples reflex to a laboratory-developed, POWV-specific immunofluorescence assay (IFA). The analytical sensitivity of the test panel was 89%, and the limit of detection was a plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) titer of 1:20. The analytical specificity was 100% for the IgM assay and 65% for the IgG assay when heterologous-flavivirus-positive samples were tested. On samples collected from regions where Lyme disease is endemic, seroprevalence for POWV in TBD samples was 9.4% (10 of 106) versus 2% when tested with non-TBD samples (2 of 100, P = 0.034). No evidence of POWV infection was seen in samples collected from a region where Lyme disease was not endemic (0 of 22). This test panel provides a sensitive and specific platform for detecting a serologic response to POWV early in the course of infection when neutralizing antibodies may not be detectable. Combined with clinical history, the panel is an effective tool for identifying acute POWV infection. IMPORTANCE Approximately 100 cases of POWV disease were reported in the United States over the past 10 years. Most cases have occurred in the Northeast (52) and Great Lakes (45) regions (https://www.cdc.gov/powassan/statistics.html). The prevalence of POWV in ticks and mammals is increasing, and POWV poses an increasing threat in a greater geographical range. In areas of the Northeast and Midwest where Lyme disease is endemic, POWV testing is recommended for patients with a recent tick bite, patients with Lyme disease who have been treated with antibiotics, or patients with a tick exposure who have tested negative for Lyme disease or other tick-borne illnesses and have persistent symptoms consistent with posttreatment Lyme disease. Testing could also benefit patients with tick exposure and unexplained neurologic symptoms and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) patients with known tick exposure. Until now, diagnostic testing for Powassan virus has not been commercially available and has been limited to patients presenting with severe, neurologic complications. The lack of routine testing for Powassan virus in patients with suspected tick-borne disease means that little information is available regarding the overall prevalence of the virus and the full spectrum of clinical symptoms associated with infection. As Ixodes scapularis is the tick vector for Powassan virus and multiple other tick-borne pathogens, including the Lyme disease bacterium, Borrelia burgdorferi, the clinical presentations and long-term outcomes of Powassan virus infection and concurrent infection with other tick-borne disease pathogens remain unknown.","Thomm, Angela M.; Schotthoefer, Anna M.; Dupuis, Alan P.; Kramer, Laura D.; Frost, Holly M.; Fritsche, Thomas R.; Harrington, Yvette A.; Knox, Konstance K.; Kehl, Sue C.",mSphere,4,28

(2013) Detection of influenza A virus in live bird markets in Kenya, 2009–2011. Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses 7(2), 113–119. Background Surveillance for influenza viruses within live bird markets (LBMs) has been recognized as an effective tool for detecting circulating avian influenza viruses (AIVs). In Sub‐Saharan Africa, limited data exist on AIVs in animal hosts, and in Kenya the presence of influenza virus in animal hosts has not been described. Objectives This surveillance project aimed to detect influenza A virus in poultry traded in five LBMs in Kenya. Methods We visited each market monthly and collected oropharyngeal and cloacal specimens from poultry and environmental specimens for virological testing for influenza A by real time RT‐PCR. On each visit, we collected information on the number and types of birds in each market, health status of the birds, and market practices. Results During March 24, 2009–February 28, 2011, we collected 5221 cloacal and oropharyngeal swabs. Of the 5199 (99·6%) specimens tested, influenza A virus was detected in 42 (0·8%), including 35/4166 (0·8%) specimens from chickens, 3/381 (0·8%) from turkeys, and 4/335 (1·2%) from geese. None of the 317 duck specimens were positive. Influenza was more commonly detected in oropharyngeal [33 (1·3%)] than in cloacal [9 (0·4%)] specimens. None of the 485 environmental specimens were positive. Virus was detected in all five markets during most (14/22) of the months. Ducks and geese were kept longer at the market (median 30 days) than chickens (median 2 days). Conclusions Influenza A was detected in a small percentage of poultry traded in LBMs in Kenya. Efforts should be made to promote practices that could limit the maintenance and transmission of AIVs in LBMs.","Munyua, Peninah M.; Githinji, Jane W.; Waiboci, Lilian W.; Njagi, Leonard M.; Arunga, Geoffrey; Mwasi, Lydia; Murithi Mbabu, R.; Macharia, Joseph M.; Breiman, Robert F.; Kariuki Njenga, M.; Katz, Mark A.",Influenza Other Respir Viruses,4,28

Cold-adapted, live attenuated influenza vaccine (CAIV) induces local innate immune responses that provide a broad range of antiviral immunity. Herein, we examined whether X-31ca, a donor virus for CAIVs, provides non-specific cross-protection against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The degree of RSV replication was significantly reduced when X-31ca was administered before RSV infection without any RSV-specific antibody responses. The vaccination induced an immediate release of cytokines and infiltration of leukocytes into the respiratory tract, moderating the immune perturbation caused by RSV infection. The potency of protection against RSV challenge was significantly reduced in TLR3(-/-) TLR7(-/-) mice, confirming that the TLR3/7 signaling pathways are necessary for the observed immediate and short-term protection. The results suggest that CAIVs provide short-term, non-specific protection against genetically unrelated respiratory pathogens. The additional benefits of CAIVs in mitigating acute respiratory infections for which vaccines are not yet available need to be assessed in future studies.","Lee, Young J.; Lee, Jeong Y.; Jang, Yo H.; Seo, Sang-Uk; Chang, Jun; Seong, Baik L.",Front Microbiol,4,28
3061,3061,3061,Identification of a novel compound targeting the nuclear export of influenza A virus nucleoprotein,11.613998,8.180324,2017-11-30,"Although antiviral drugs are available for the treatment of influenza infection, it is an urgent requirement to develop new antiviral drugs regarding the emergence of drug‐resistant viruses. The nucleoprotein (NP) is conserved among all influenza A viruses (IAVs) and has no cellular equivalent. Therefore, NP is an ideal target for the development of new IAV inhibitors. In this study, we identified a novel anti‐influenza compound, ZBMD‐1, from a library of 20,000 compounds using cell‐based influenza A infection assays. We found that ZBMD‐1 inhibited the replication of H1N1 and H3N2 influenza A virus strains in vitro, with an IC (50) ranging from 0.41–1.14 μM. Furthermore, ZBMD‐1 inhibited the polymerase activity and specifically impaired the nuclear export of NP. Further investigation indicated that ZBMD‐1 binds to the nuclear export signal 3 (NES3) domain and the dimer interface of the NP pocket. ZBMD‐1 also protected mice that were challenged with lethal doses of A/PR/8/1934 (H1N1) virus, effectively relieving lung histopathology changes, as well as strongly inhibiting the expression of pro‐inflammatory cytokines/chemokines, without inducing toxicity effects in mice. These results suggest that ZBMD‐1 is a promising anti‐influenza compound which can be further investigated as a useful strategy against IAVs in the future.","Huang, Feng; Chen, Jingliang; Zhang, Junsong; Tan, Likai; Lu, Gui; Luo, Yongjie; Pan, Ting; Liang, Juanran; Li, Qianwen; Luo, Baohong; Zhang, Hui; Lu, Gen",J Cell Mol Med,4,28

Among the causative organisms of pneumonia and meningitis, bacteria are the most common causes of serious disease and deaths. It is challenging to accurately and rapidly identify these agents. To solve this problem, we developed and validated a 12-plex PCR coupled with matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) method (bacterial pathogen-mass spectrometry, BP-MS) that can be used to simultaneously screen for 11 key bacterial pathogens related to pneumonia and meningitis. Forty-six nasopharyngeal swabs and 12 isolates were used to determine the specificity of the method. The results showed that, using the BP-MS method, we could accurately identify the expected bacteria without cross-reactivity with other pathogens. For the 11 target bacterial pathogens, the analytical sensitivity of the BP-MS method was as low as 10 copies/reaction. To further evaluate the clinical effectiveness of this method, 204 nasopharyngeal swabs from hospitalized children with suspected pneumonia were tested using this method. In total, 81.9% (167/204) of the samples were positive for at least one of the 11 target pathogens. Among the 167 bacteria-positive samples, the rate of multiple infections was 55.7% (93/167), and the most frequent combination was Streptococcus pneumoniae with Haemophilus influenzae, representing 46.2% (43/93) two-pathogen mixed infections. We used real-time PCR and nested PCR to confirm positive results, with identical results obtained for 81.4% (136/167) of the samples. The BP-MS method is a sensitive and specific molecular detection technique in a multiplex format and with high sample throughput. Therefore, it will be a powerful tool for pathogen screening and antibiotic selection at an early stage of disease.","Zhang, Chi; Xiu, Leshan; Xiao, Yan; Xie, Zhengde; Ren, Lili; Peng, Junping",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,4,8

Physiological and pathological conditions of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) trigger unfolded protein response and contribute to the development or pathology of inflammatory diseases. Under ER stress, unfolded protein response (UPR) signaling pathways participate in upregulating inflammatory cytokine production via NF-kappaB, MAPK, and GSK-3β. Moreover, it has been suggested that ER stress crosstalks with toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathway to promote the production of proinflammatory cytokines. In addition, TLR stimulation can lead to UPR activation to promote inflammation. In this review, we will cover how proinflammatory cytokine production by UPR signaling can be induced or amplified in the presence or absence of TLR activation.","Kim, Sena; Joe, Yeonsoo; Surh, Young-Joon; Chung, Hun Taeg",Oxid Med Cell Longev,4,8

It is becoming apparent, however, that severe neurological sequelae, such as Guillian-Barrë syndrome (GBS), myelitis, encephalitis, and seizures can occur after infection of adults. This study demonstrates that a contemporary strain of ZIKV can widely infect astrocytes and neurons in the brain and spinal cord of adult, interferon α/β receptor knockout mice (AG129 strain) and cause progressive hindlimb paralysis, as well as severe seizure-like activity during the acute phase of disease. The severity of hindlimb motor deficits correlated with increased numbers of ZIKV-infected lumbosacral spinal motor neurons and decreased numbers of spinal motor neurons. Electrophysiological compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitudes in response to stimulation of the lumbosacral spinal cord were reduced when obvious motor deficits were present. ZIKV immunoreactivity was high, intense, and obvious in tissue sections of the brain and spinal cord. Infection in the brain and spinal cord was also associated with astrogliosis as well as T cell and neutrophil infiltration. CMAP and histological analysis indicated that peripheral nerve and muscle functions were intact. Consequently, motor deficits in these circumstances appear to be primarily due to myelitis and possibly encephalitis as opposed to a peripheral neuropathy or a GBS-like syndrome. Thus, acute ZIKV infection of adult AG129 mice may be a useful model for ZIKV-induced myelitis, encephalitis, and seizure activity.

We implemented live bird market surveillance in Bangladesh to identify the subtypes of avian influenza A viruses in domestic waterfowl and market environments. We collected waterfowl samples monthly from 4 rural sites from 2007 to 2012 and environmental samples from 4 rural and 16 urban sites from 2009 to 2012. Samples were tested through real-time RT-PCR, virus culture, and sequencing to detect and characterize avian influenza A viruses. Among 4,308 waterfowl tested, 191 (4.4%) were positive for avian influenza A virus, including 74 (1.9%) avian influenza A/H5 subtype. The majority (99%, n = 73) of the influenza A/H5-positive samples were from healthy appearing waterfowl.

In this work, we developed a prototype open-architecture, automated nucleic acid workstation that includes a mechanical homogenization and lysis function integrated with heating and TruTip purification; optimized an extraction protocol for raw sputum; and evaluated system performance on primary clinical specimens. Eight samples could be processed within 70 min. The system efficiently homogenized primary sputa and doubled nucleic acid recovery relative to an automated protocol that did not incorporate sample homogenization. Nucleic acid recovery was at least five times higher from raw sputum as compared to that of matched sediments regardless of smear or culture grade, and the automated workstation reproducibly recovered PCR-detectable DNA to at least 80 CFU mL(-1) raw sputum. M. tuberculosis DNA was recovered and detected from 122/123 (99.2%) and 124/124 (100%) primary sputum and sediment extracts, respectively. There was no detectable cross-contamination across 53 automated system runs and amplification or fluorescent inhibitors (if present) were not detectable. The open fluidic architecture of the prototype automated workstation yields purified sputum DNA that can be used for any molecular diagnostic test. The ability to transfer TruTip protocols between personalized, on-demand pipetting tools and the fully automated workstation also affords public health agencies an opportunity to standardize sputum nucleic acid sample preparation procedures, reagents, and quality control across multiple levels of the health care system.","Thakore, Nitu; Norville, Ryan; Franke, Molly; Calderon, Roger; Lecca, Leonid; Villanueva, Michael; Murray, Megan B.; Cooney, Christopher G.; Chandler, Darrell P.; Holmberg, Rebecca C.",PLoS One,4,1

Given the disease severity, associated economic costs, and recent appearance of novel IAV strains, there is a renewed interest in developing novel and efficacious “universal” IAV vaccination strategies. Recent studies have highlighted that immunizations capable of generating local (i.e., nasal mucosa and lung) tissue-resident memory T and B cells in addition to systemic immunity offer the greatest protection against future IAV encounters. Current IAV vaccines are designed to largely stimulate IAV-specific antibodies, but do not generate the lung-resident memory T and B cells induced during IAV infections. Herein, we report on an intranasally administered biocompatible polyanhydride nanoparticle-based IAV vaccine (IAV-nanovax) capable of providing protection against subsequent homologous and heterologous IAV infections in both inbred and outbred populations. Our findings also demonstrate that vaccination with IAV-nanovax promotes the induction of germinal center B cells within the lungs, both systemic and lung local IAV-specific antibodies, and IAV-specific lung-resident memory CD4 and CD8 T cells. Altogether our findings show that an intranasally administered nanovaccine can induce immunity within the lungs, similar to what occurs during IAV infections, and thus could prove useful as a strategy for providing “universal” protection against IAV.","Zacharias, Zeb R.; Ross, Kathleen A.; Hornick, Emma E.; Goodman, Jonathan T.; Narasimhan, Balaji; Waldschmidt, Thomas J.; Legge, Kevin L.",Front Immunol,4,28

Hemoglobin provides the most abundant source of iron in the human body and is required by several pathogens to cause invasive disease. However, the consequences of hemoglobin evolution for bacterial nutrient acquisition remain unclear. Here we show that the α- and β-globin genes exhibit strikingly parallel signatures of adaptive evolution across simian primates. Rapidly evolving sites in hemoglobin correspond to binding interfaces of IsdB, a bacterial hemoglobin receptor harbored by pathogenic Staphylococcus aureus. Using an evolution-guided experimental approach, we demonstrate that the divergence between primates and staphylococcal isolates governs hemoglobin recognition and bacterial growth. The reintroduction of putative adaptive mutations in α- or β-globin proteins was sufficient to impair S. aureus binding, providing a mechanism for the evolution of disease resistance. These findings suggest that bacterial hemoprotein capture has driven repeated evolutionary conflicts with hemoglobin during primate descent.","Choby, Jacob E.; Buechi, Hanna B.; Farrand, Allison J.; Skaar, Eric P.; Barber, Matthew F.",mBio,4,1

The functions of PDCs in the lung can be influenced by airway epithelial cells. We examined the effect of human primary bronchial epithelial cells (PBECs) on PDC functions by performing RNA-sequencing of PDCs after co-culture with air liquid interface differentiated PBECs. Functional analysis revealed that PDCs co-cultured with PBECs displayed upregulation of type I IFN production and response genes. Upregulated transcripts included those encoding cytosolic sensors of DNA, ZBP-1,IRF-3, and NFkB as well as genes involved in amplification of the IFN response, such as IFNAR1, JAK/STAT, ISG15. In keeping with the RNA-seq data, we observe increased secretion of type I IFN and other cytokines in response to influenza in PDCs co-cultured with PBECs. The PDCs also primed Th1 responses in T cells. The enhanced response of PDCs co-cultured with PBECs was due to the action of growth factors, GMCSF, GCSF, and VEGF, which were secreted by PBECs on differentiation. These data highlight possible mechanisms to enhance the production of type-I IFN in the airways, which is critical for host defense against respiratory infections.","Rahmatpanah, Farah; Agrawal, Sudhanshu; Jaiswal, Natasha; Nguyen, Hannah M.; McClelland, Michael; Agrawal, Anshu",Mucosal Immunol,4,1

DcR3 mRNA and protein levels in HUVECs were increased following treatment with LPS, LTA and zymosan, and also increased in Jurkat cells treated by LPS, but not by LTA or zymosan. When HUVECs were treated with the NF-κB inhibitor PDTC, DcR3 expression was decreased compared with controls. However, SP600125 and SB203580 had no effect on DcR3 mRNA or protein levels.

In either case, administration or expression of recombinant proteins plays a fundamental role. mRNA prepared by in vitro transcription (IVT) is increasingly appreciated as a drug substance for delivery of recombinant proteins. With its biological role as transient carrier of genetic information translated into protein in the cytoplasm, therapeutic application of mRNA combines several advantages. For example, compared to transfected DNA, mRNA harbors inherent safety features. It is not associated with the risk of inducing genomic changes and potential adverse effects are only temporary due to its transient nature. Compared to the administration of recombinant proteins produced in bioreactors, mRNA allows supplying proteins that are difficult to manufacture and offers extended pharmacokinetics for short-lived proteins. Based on great progress in understanding and manipulating mRNA properties, efficacy data in various models have now demonstrated that IVT mRNA constitutes a potent and flexible platform technology.

However, the molecular and biological mechanisms of how Y. pseudotuberculosis evolved to such a remarkably virulent pathogen, Y. pestis, are not clear. The ability to initiate a rapid bacterial dissemination is a characteristic hallmark of Y. pestis infection. A distinguishing characteristic between the two Yersinia species is that Y. pseudotuberculosis strains possess an O-antigen of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) while Y. pestis has lost the O-antigen during evolution and therefore exposes its core LPS. In this study, we showed that Y. pestis utilizes its core LPS to interact with SIGNR1 (CD209b), a C-type lectin receptor on antigen presenting cells (APCs), leading to bacterial dissemination to lymph nodes, spleen and liver, and the initiation of a systemic infection. We therefore propose that the loss of O-antigen represents a critical step in the evolution of Y. pseudotuberculosis into Y. pestis in terms of hijacking APCs, promoting bacterial dissemination and causing the plague.","Yang, Kun; He, Yingxia; Park, Chae Gyu; Kang, Young Sun; Zhang, Pei; Han, Yanping; Cui, Yujun; Bulgheresi, Silvia; Anisimov, Andrey P.; Dentovskaya, Svetlana V.; Ying, Xiaoling; Jiang, Lingyu; Ding, Honghui; Njiri, Olivia Adhiambo; Zhang, Shusheng; Zheng, Guoxing; Xia, Lianxu; Kan, Biao; Wang, Xin; Jing, Huaiqi; Yan, Meiying; Li, Wei; Wang, Yuanzhi; Xiamu, Xiding; Chen, Gang; Ma, Ding; Bartra, Sara Schesser; Plano, Gregory V.; Klena, John D.; Yang, Ruifu; Skurnik, Mikael; Chen, Tie",Front Immunol,4,1

Intranasal and intramuscular administration of AdC7αRSV to adult mice resulted in similar levels of anti-RSV IgG in the serum. However, only intranasal administration resulted in detectable levels of anti-RSV IgG in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Intranasal administration of AdC7αRSV provided protection against subsequent RSV challenge. Expression of the anti-RSV antibody was prolonged following intranasal administration of AdC7αRSV to neonatal mice. Protection against RSV was confirmed at 6 weeks of age.

To promote the study of HMPV, several groups have generated green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing recombinant HMPV strains (HMPV(GFP)). However, the growing evidence has complicated the understanding of cell line specificity of HMPV, because it seems to vary notably among HMPV strains.

Also, the infectivity in these suboptimal cell lines varied greatly among HMPV strains. The variations were not directly related to HMPV genotypes, cell lines used for isolation and propagation, specific genome mutations, or nucleotide duplications in the G gene.

As seen in other viral infections, type I IFN can also increase systemic immune activation which, in HIV disease, is one of the strongest predictors of disease progression to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and non-AIDS morbidity and mortality. Moreover, IFN-I is associated with CD4 T cell depletion and attenuation of antigen-specific T cell responses. Therefore, therapeutic manipulation of IFN-I signaling to improve HIV disease outcome is a source of much interest and debate in the field.

Release of CD63-containing EVs from stably expressing cell lines was monitored by comparing luciferase activity in culture media to that remaining in cells. HEK293, U2OS, U87 and SKMel28 cells released 0.3%-0.6% of total cellular CD63 in the form of EVs over 5 hrs, varying by cell line. To identify cellular machinery important for secretion of CD63-containing EVs, we performed a screen of biologically active chemicals in HEK293 cells. While a majority of compounds did not significantly affect EV release, treating cells with the plecomacrolides bafilomycin or concanamycin, known to inhibit the V-ATPase, dramatically increased EV release. Interestingly, alkalization of the endosomal lumen using weak bases had no effect, suggesting a pH-independent enhancement of EV release by V-ATPase inhibitors.

We have previously shown that antigen-specific, IL-17-producing CD4(+) T cells can provide capsular antibody-independent protection against nasal carriage of Streptococcus pneumoniae; but whether pneumococcus-responsive T(RM) are localized within the nasal mucosa and are sufficient for protection from carriage has not been determined. Here we show that intranasal administration of live or killed pneumococci to mice generates pneumococcus-responsive IL-17A-producing CD4(+) mucosal T(RM). Furthermore, we show that these cells are sufficient to mediate long-lived, neutrophil-dependent protection against subsequent pneumococcal nasal challenge. Unexpectedly, and in contrast with the prevailing paradigm, we found that parenteral administration of killed pneumococci also generates protective IL-17A(+)CD4(+) T(RM) in the nasal mucosa. These results demonstrate a critical and sufficient role of T(RM) in prevention of pneumococcal colonization, and further that these cells can be generated by parenteral immunization. Our findings therefore have important implications regarding the generation of immune protection at mucosal surfaces by vaccination.","O’Hara, Joanne M.; Redhu, Naresh Singh; Cheung, Elaine; Robertson, Nahid G.; Patik, Izabel; Sayed, Shorouk El; Thompson, Claudette M.; Herd, Muriel; Lucas, Katherine B.; Conaway, Evan; Morton, Cynthia C.; Farber, Donna L.; Malley, Richard; Horwitz, Bruce H.",Mucosal Immunol,4,1
4376,4376,4376,Reproductive performance of pandemic influenza A virus infected sow herds before and after implementation of a vaccine against the influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 virus,11.669357,7.8403826,2020-01-23,"BACKGROUND: Reproductive failure in sow herds due to infection with influenza A viruses has been described in the literature, but only a few studies have focused on the pathogenesis and the clinical signs of the infection. Case reports indicate an association between infections with influenza A viruses and reduced reproductive performance, although it has been difficult to experimentally reproduce the clinical outcome of poor reproductive performance. The aim of the present longitudinal field study was to compare the reproductive performance parameters before and after the implementation of vaccination against the influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 virus in sow herds infected with pandemic influenza A virus. Therefore, farm-specific data of 137 sow herds in Germany, including 60,153 sows, as well as the clinical presentation of the infection were surveyed via questionnaire. Furthermore, average performance parameters (return to oestrus rate, abortion rate, stillbirth rate, number of piglets born alive per litter, preweaning mortality rate and number of piglets weaned per sow per year) were recorded for 6 months before vaccination and 6 months after completion of primary vaccination. RESULTS: In 79.8% of the farms, the clinical presentation of the infection was characterised by a reduced reproductive performance. These findings were confirmed by analysis of the performance parameters, which revealed a significant decline in the return to oestrus rate (p < 0.001), abortion rate (p < 0.001) and preweaning mortality rate (p = 0.023) and a significant increase of the number in piglets born alive (p = 0.001) and piglets weaned per sow per year (p < 0.001) after immunisation. The stillbirth rate did not change significantly. CONCLUSION: The present study represents the first attempt to demonstrate the association of influenza A virus infection, vaccination and the alteration in reproductive performance parameters, investigating a large number of cases. The results show that by vaccinating against the influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 virus, an improvement in reproductive performance can be achieved in sow herds infected with pandemic influenza A virus. Additionally, the large number of herds that were affected by poor reproductive performance after infection with the aforementioned virus confirms the assumption of an association between pandemic influenza A virus and reproductive losses.","Gumbert, Sophie; Froehlich, Sebastian; Rieger, Anna; Stadler, Julia; Ritzmann, Mathias; Zoels, Susanne",Porcine Health Manag,4,28

Most septoplasties aim to improve diurnal and nocturnal nasal obstruction. The evidence base for septoplasty clinical effectiveness is hitherto very limited. AIMS: To establish, and inform guidance for, the best management strategy for individuals with nasal obstruction associated with a deviated septum. METHODS/DESIGN: A multicentre, mixed-methods, open label, randomised controlled trial of septoplasty versus medical management for adults with a deviated septum and a reduced nasal airway. Eligible patients will have septal deflection visible at nasendoscopy and a nasal symptom score ≥ 30 on the NOSE questionnaire. Surgical treatment comprises septoplasty with or without reduction of the inferior nasal turbinate on the anatomically wider side of the nose. Medical management comprises a nasal saline spray followed by a fluorinated steroid spray daily for six months. The recruitment target is 378 patients, recruited from up to 17 sites across Scotland, England and Wales. Randomisation will be on a 1:1 basis, stratified by gender and severity (NOSE score). Participants will be followed up for 12 months post randomisation. The primary outcome measure is the total SNOT-22 score at 6 months. Clinical and economic outcomes will be modelled against baseline severity (NOSE scale) to inform clinical decision-making. The study includes a recruitment enhancement process, and an economic evaluation. DISCUSSION: The NAIROS trial will evaluate the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of septoplasty versus medical management for adults with a deviated septum and symptoms of nasal blockage. Identifying those individuals most likely to benefit from surgery should enable more efficient and effective clinical decision-making, and avoid unnecessary operations where there is low likelihood of patient benefit.

So far, the expression of capsid and envelope proteins in infected cells has been considered an absolute requirement for alphavirus budding and propagation. In the present study, we show that Semliki Forest virus and Sindbis virus lacking the capsid gene can propagate in mammalian and insect cells. This propagation is mediated by the release of infectious microvesicles (iMVs), which are pleomorphic and have a larger size and density than wild-type virus. iMVs, which contain viral RNA inside and viral envelope proteins on their surface, are released at the plasma membrane and infect cells using the endocytic pathway in a similar way to wild-type virus. iMVs are not pathogenic in immunocompetent mice when injected intravenously, but can infect different organs like lungs and heart. Finally, we also show that alphavirus genomes without capsid can mediate the propagation of heterologous genes, making these vectors potentially interesting for gene therapy or vaccination studies. The minimalist infectious system described in this study shows that a self-replicating RNA able to express membrane proteins with binding and fusion properties is able to propagate, providing some insights into virus evolution.

As of January 2014, 275 cases of H7N9-infected patients had been reported, highlighting the urgency of identifying biomarkers for predicting disease severity and fatal outcomes. Here, we show that plasma levels of angiotensin II, a major regulatory peptide of the renin–angiotensin system, are markedly elevated in H7N9 patients and are associated with disease progression. Moreover, the sustained high levels of angiotensin II in these patients are strongly correlated with mortality. The predictive value of angiotensin II is higher than that of C-reactive protein and some clinical parameters such as the PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio (partial pressure of arterial oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen).

According to the World Health Organization, it is currently the sixth leading cause of death in the world, and further increases in the prevalence and mortality of the disease is predicted for the coming decades. These increases are mainly linked to the epidemic of tobacco exposure and indoor and outdoor air pollution in Asian countries. The burden of COPD in Asia is currently greater than that in developed Western countries, both in terms of the total number of deaths and the burden of disease, as measured in years of life lost and years spent living with disability. The types of health-care policies and the practice of medicine vary considerably among the regions of Asia and have an impact on the burden of disease. Treatment aims in Asian countries are based on evidence-based management guidelines. Barriers to the implementation of disease management guidelines are related to issues of resource conflict and lack of organizational support rather than cultural differences in medical practice. To reduce this burden of COPD in Asian countries, there is a need for a multifaceted approach in improving awareness of prevalence and disease burden, in facilitating accurate diagnosis of COPD among chronic respiratory diseases, in championing health policies that reduce the burden of the main risk factors for COPD and in the wider use of evidence-based management for COPD.","Tan, Wan C.; Ng, Tze P.",Chest,4,1

Accordingly, anaphylatoxins generated after complement system activation, factors of coagulation and fibrinolysis, proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, proteases, lipid mediators, nitric oxide, and cell markers of stress (eg, high mobility group box-1) have been shown to contribute to the deleterious events observed during sepsis.

Free radical reactions have been implicated in the pathology of more than 50 human diseases. Radicals and other reactive oxygen species are formed constantly in the human body, both by deliberate synthesis (e.g. by activated phagocytes) and by chemical side- reactions. They are removed by enzymic and nonenzymic antioxidant defence systems. Oxidative stress, occurring when antioxidant defences are inadequate, can damage lipids, proteins, carbohydrates and DNA. A few clinical conditions are caused by oxidative stress, but more often the stress results from the disease. Sometimes it then makes a significant contribution to the disease pathology, and sometimes it does not. Several antioxidants are available for therapeutic use. They include molecules naturally present in the body [superoxide dismutase (SOD), α-tocopherol, glutathione and its precursors, ascorbic acid, adenosine, lactoferrin and carotenoids] as well as synthetic antioxidants [such as thiols, ebselen (PZ51), xanthine oxidase inhibitors, inhibitors of phagocyte function, iron ion chelators and probucol]. The therapeutic efficacy of SOD, α- tocopherol and ascorbic acid in the treatment of human disease is generally unimpressive to date although dietary deficiencies of the last two molecules should certainly be avoided. Xanthine oxidase inhibitors may be of limited relevance as antioxidants for human use. Exciting preliminary results with probucol (antiatherosclerosis), ebselen (anti-inflammatory), and iron ion chelators (in thalassaemia, leukaemia, malaria, stroke, traumatic brain injury and haemorrhagic shock) need to be confirmed by controlled clinical trials. Clinical testing of N-acetylcysteine in HIV-1-positive subjects may also be merited.

This confusion results because this pathologic finding occurs in a variety of diverse clinical settings. Bronchiolitis obliterans is a fibrotic process that primarily affects the small conducting airways. The lesion results from damage to the bronchiolar epithelium and the repair process leads to excessive proliferation of granulation tissue. The alveoli adjacent to the small airway are almost always involved; however, a considerable portion of the interstitium is usually spared. The findings in these patients may physiologically and radiographically mimic chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). On the other hand, some of the processes associated with bronchiolitis obliterans result in restrictive or mixed restrictive and obstructive ventilatory defects; consequently, they may be confused with other diffuse infiltrative lung disorders. This review will focus principally on bronchiolitis obliterans in adults, which, until recently, was considered rare. There has been heightened interest in this process in adults because of its association with the connective tissue diseases, its development following toxic fume exposure, its occurrence as a result of chronic graft versus host reactions, and the increasing recognition of patients with idiopathic forms of the disease that have an insidious onset often confused with more common problems such as COPD or idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.","King, Talmadge E.",Lung,4,8

Rhinovirus RNA was detected in 45% of patients; infection with another virus occurred in 31%. The most common bacterial pathogen was Mycoplasma pneumoniae, which was diagnosed in 35% of cases. Chlamydia pneumoniae DNA was not detected in any patient; results of serological tests were positive in only 2 patients (3%). Mixed infections were documented in 35% of patients, and the majority were a viral-bacterial combination. Conclusions.

Analysis of the evidence indicates that while all of these theories are correct, exceptions to each can also be found. The biological roles of oligosaccharides appear to span the spectrum from those that are trivial, to those that are crucial for the development, growth, function or survival of an organism. Some general principles emerge. First, it is difficult to predict a priori the functions a given oligosaccharide on a given glycoconjugate might be mediating, or their relative importance to the organism. Second, the same oligosaccharide sequence may mediate different functions at different locations within the same organism, or at different times in its ontogeny or life cycle. Third, the more specific and crucial biological roles of oligosaccharides are often mediated by unusual oligosaccharide sequences, unusual presentations of common terminal sequences, or by further modifications of the sugars themselves. However, such oligosaccharide sequences are also more likely to be targets for recognition by pathogenic toxins and microorganisms. As such, they are subject to more intra- and inter-species variation because of ongoing host—pathogen interactions during evolution. In the final analysis, the only common features of the varied functions of oligosaccharides are that they either mediate ‘specific recognition’ events or that they provide ‘modulation’ of biological processes. In so doing, they generate much of the functional diversity required for the development and differentiation of complex organisms, and for their interactions with other organisms in the environment.","Varki, Ajit",Glycobiology,4,11

Sequence variability in the amplified segment of the dnaA gene allowed the differentiation of all species except for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium africanum and Mycobacterium microti, which had identical sequences. Partial sequences of dnaA from clinical isolates belonging to three frequently isolated species revealed a very high intraspecies similarity, with a range of 96.0–100%. Based on the dnaA sequences, a species-specific primer set for Mycobacterium kansasii and Mycobacterium gastri was successfully designed for a simple loop-mediated isothermal amplification method. These results demonstrate that the variable sequences in the dnaA gene were species specific and were sufficient for the development of an accurate and rapid diagnosis of Mycobacterium species.","Mukai, Tetsu; Miyamoto, Yuji; Yamazaki, Toshio; Makino, Masahiko",FEMS Microbiol Lett,4,8

In this study, we constructed two recombinant protein vaccines, 2H5M2e-2H7M2e-H5FP-H7FP (hereinafter M2e-FP-1) and 2H5M2e-H5FP-2H7M2e-H7FP (hereinafter M2e-FP-2), by respectively linking highly conserved sequences of two molecules of ectodomain of M2 (M2e) and one molecule of fusion peptide (FP) epitope of hemagglutinin (HA) of H5N1 and H7N9 influenza viruses in different orders. The Escherichia coli-expressed M2e-FP-1 and M2e-FP-2 proteins induced similarly high-titer M2e-FP-specific antibodies in the immunized mice. Importantly, both proteins were able to prevent lethal challenge of heterologous H1N1 influenza virus, with significantly reduced viral titers and alleviated pathological changes in the lungs, as well as increased body weight and complete survivals, in the challenge mice. Taken together, our study demonstrates that highly conserved M2e and FP epitope of HA of H5N1 and H7N9 influenza viruses can be used as important targets for development of safe and economical universal influenza vaccines, and that the position of H7N9 M2e and H5N1 HA epitope sequences in the vaccine components has no significant effects on the immunogenicity and efficacy of M2e-FP-based subunit vaccines.","Guo, Yan; He, Lei; Song, Nianping; Li, Pei; Sun, Shihui; Zhao, Guangyu; Tai, Wanbo; Jiang, Shibo; Du, Lanying; Zhou, Yusen",Microbes Infect,4,22

The synthesis, transport, and degradation of S1P are tightly regulated to ensure that S1P is present in the proper concentrations in the proper location. The binding of S1P to five G protein-coupled S1P receptors regulates many physiological systems, particularly the immune and vascular systems. Our understanding of the functions of S1P has been aided by the tractability of the system to both chemical and genetic manipulation. Chemical modulators have been generated to affect most of the known components of S1P biology, including agonists of S1P receptors and inhibitors of enzymes regulating S1P production and degradation. Genetic knockouts and manipulations have been similarly engineered to disrupt the functions of individual S1P receptors or enzymes involved in S1P metabolism. This chapter will focus on the development and utilization of these chemical and genetic tools to explore the complex biology surrounding S1P and its receptors, with particular attention paid to the in vivo findings that these tools have allowed for.","Cahalan, Stuart M.",Sphingosine-1-Phosphate Signaling in Immunology and Infectious Diseases,4,1

However, the excessive generation of oxygen radicals under pathological conditions such as acute lung injury (ALI) and its most severe form acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) leads to increased endothelial permeability. Within this hallmark of ALI and ARDS, vascular microvessels lose their junctional integrity and show increased myosin contractions that promote the migration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) and the transition of solutes and fluids in the alveolar lumen. These processes all have a redox component, and this chapter focuses on the role played by ROS during the development of ALI/ARDS. We discuss the origins of ROS within the cell, cellular defense mechanisms against oxidative damage, the role of ROS in the development of endothelial permeability, and potential therapies targeted at oxidative stress.","Kellner, Manuela; Noonepalle, Satish; Lu, Qing; Srivastava, Anup; Zemskov, Evgeny; Black, Stephen M.",Pulmonary Vasculature Redox Signaling in Health and Disease,4,11

The disease is characterized pathologically by an intense inflammatory infiltration within both the white and grey matter of the central nervous system (CNS) without apparent demyelination. Both during and after SAME splenic lymphocytes from these animals could be restimulated in vitro to proliferate in the presence of myelin basic protein (MBP). MBP-specific class II MHC-restricted T cell lines were isolated from this cell population. They were shown to exhibit no cross-reactivity with measles virus and to induce experimental allergic encephalitis (EAE) in naive syngeneic recipients following adoptive transfer. The clinical and histopathological signs of this T cell-mediated disease were identical to that seen in classical T cell-mediated EAE. A humoral immune response to MBP was only detected in a limited number of those rats with SAME.

There is also concern that these alternative methods may pose a risk to workers and patients. Objectives. (1) Determine the efficacy of a germicidal UV-C wand for surface disinfection, (2) evaluate changing relative humidity (RH) and different target distances on bacteria kill rates, and (3) assess potential exposure concerns. Methods. This study investigates whether a hand-held germicidal wand can efficaciously disinfect surfaces treated with either a vegetative or spore forming bacterium and to evaluate the effect of changing environmental conditions such as relative humidity (RH), target position, and target distances on microbial kill rates. Results. Kill rate was best at 40–65% RH at a temperature range of 21–24°C. Both high and low RH interfered with the ability of UV-C to kill the vegetative microbe. In the case of the spore forming bacterium, increased surface drying time was the most significant factor increasing kill rate. Conclusions. This research demonstrates that UV-C was efficacious under optimal conditions, a direct beam exposure, and a short target distance (12.7 cm). However, there are limitations when used in non-optimal conditions. Increased distance and indirect beam angles resulted in lower kill rates. It is also important to minimize unnecessary patient and worker exposure during its use.","Byrns, George; Barham, Beverly; Yang, Liangcheng; Webster, Kathryn; Rutherford, George; Steiner, Garrett; Petras, Daniel; Scannell, Michele",J Occup Environ Hyg,4,11

Fossil penguins also were studied using measurements from 111 skeletal elements representing 18 species. Most external and skeletal measurements follow interspecific rankings in body mass; the latter span a 30‐fold range from 1 kg in Eudyptula minor to 30 kg in Aptenodytes forsteri. Flighted Pelecanoides is only one‐tenth the mass of the smallest spheniscid. Wing areas and body masses of penguins maintain approximate geometric similitude among species; the allometric coefficient is 0.62 ± 0.04. Several skeletal elements are less derived in conformation in the fossil penguins than in modern confamilials. Despite great variation in the lengths of wing and leg skeletons, penguins show relative consistency in proportions of wing elements; pelvic proportions were more variable within the Spheniscidae. Proportions within both limbs are distinctly different from those of Pelecanoides. Analysis of correlation structures within species of penguin revealed three major subsets of skeletal variables that are highly intercorrelated: trunk‐skull lengths, appendicular‐trunk widths, and appendicular lengths. Within these groups, measurements tend to separate by anatomical region and, to a lesser degree, by limb. Canonical analysis of skin and skeletal measurements revealed groupings of spheniscids on the basis of size and relatively complex shape variables. Cluster analyses of taxa on the canonical variates confirmed the similarity of congeners in Eudyptes, Eudyptula and Spheniscus; species of Aptenodytes and, to a lesser degree, Pygoscelis, are more heterogeneous. A cluster analysis of principal components of myological measurements tabulated by Schreiweis (1972) corresponded closely with phenetic groupings using external and skeletal variables. A canonical contrast between spheniscids and Pelecanoides indicated that the families differ in a relatively complex skeletal dimension that only in part reflects overall size. Multivariate assessment of sexual dimorphism in external and skeletal variables indicated that: Eudyptula is least dimorphic; Aptenodytes, Eudyptes, Megadyptes and Spheniscus are moderately dimorphic; and Pygoscelis is most dimorphic. Pelecanoides shows comparatively low dimorphism. Among‐species and within‐species first principal components of skeletal measurements (multivariate axes of skeletal ‘size’) differ from one another in their orientation, and both deviate from isometric size. The first principal component for skeletons of Pelecanoides also deviated from isometric size, but the direction of this allometry is fundamentally different from that in penguins. Estimates of body mass for fossil penguins, based on principal components of available skeletal measurements, indicate that fossil species ranged from 3 kg to 81 kg in total mass; the largest fossil species was approximately 2.5 times as massive as the largest extant spheniscid. Much of the morphometric variation in the Spheniscidae is explainable on locomotory, ecological and thermodynamic grounds, and the associated phenetic groupings conform broadly with traditional generic classifications. The evolutionary significance of mensural correlations, allometric trends and differences between fossil and Recent species are discussed, and the need for a phylogenetic analysis of this highly specialized family of winged‐propelled diving birds is stressed.","Livezey, Bradley C.",J Zool (1987),4,11

The seemingly very low toxicity of bisphosphonate and pyrophosphomonoester drugs in vivo, may allow novel approaches to the immunotherapy of viral infections. For example, these drugs can be used to stimulate Vγ9Vδ2 T cells to release antiviral molecules that directly suppress virus replication without destroying the virus-replicating cells. In addition, the soluble molecules released by γδ T cells could boost the antiviral potency of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and promote antigen presentation. The relative therapeutic value of drug-induced direct antiviral and immunoregulatory activities may depend on the infecting virus as well as on the nature of protective immune responses.","Poccia, Fabrizio; Agrati, Chiara; Martini, Federico; Mejia, Gloria; Wallace, Marianne; Malkovsky, Miroslav",Immunol Lett,4,8

Limitation for leucine, which is encoded precisely at the frameshift site, dramatically increased the frequency of leftward frameshifting. Limitation for phenylaianine or arginine, which are encoded just before and just after the frameshift, did not significantly affect frameshifting. Protein sequence analysis demonstrated the occurrence of two closeiy related frameshift mechanisms. In the first, ribosomes appear to bind leucyl‐tRNA at the frameshift site and then slip leftward. This is the 'simultaneous slippage’mechanism. In the second, ribosomes appear to slip before binding amlnoacyl‐tRNA, and then bind phenylaianyl‐tRNA, which is encoded in the left‐shifted reading frame.

It is unclear if outcome in trauma patients differs as well. Therefore, this study aims to determine differences in characteristics, therapy and outcome of trauma patients between both German-speaking countries. METHODS: The TraumaRegister DGU(®) (TR-DGU) was used. Patients with Injury Severity Score ≥ 9 admitted to a level 1 trauma centre between 01/2009 and 12/2017 were included if they required ICU care or died. Trauma pattern, pre-hospital procedures and outcome were compared between Swiss (CH, n = 4768) and German (DE, n = 66,908) groups. RESULTS: Swiss patients were older than German patients (53 vs. 50 years). ISS did not differ between groups (CH 23.8 vs. DE 23.0 points). There were more low falls < 3 m (34% vs. 21%) at the expense of less traffic accidents (37% vs. 52%) in the Swiss population. In Switzerland 30% of allocations were done without physician involvement, whereas this occurred in 4% of German cases. Despite a comparable number of patients with a GCS ≤ 8 (CH 29.6%; DE 26.4%), differences in pre-hospital intubation rates occurred (CH 31% vs. DE 40%). Severe traumatic brain injuries were diagnosed most frequently in Switzerland (CH 62% vs. DE 49%). Admission vital signs were similar, and standardized mortality ratios were close to one in both countries. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that patients’ age, trauma patterns and pre-hospital care differ between Germany and Switzerland. However, adjusted mortality was almost similar.

Tracheal aspirate (TA) cytokines, blood budesonide concentrations, and untargeted blood metabolomics were measured. Outcomes were compared with matched infants receiving surfactant in the Trial Of Late SURFactant (TOLSURF). RESULTS: Twenty-four infants with mean gestational age 25.0 weeks and 743 g birth weight requiring mechanical ventilation were enrolled at mean age 6 days. Budesonide was detected in the blood of all infants with a half-life of 3.4 h. Of 11 infants with elevated TA cytokine levels at baseline, treatment was associated with sustained decrease (mean 65%) at all three dosing levels.

The use of bleeding time tests in TBI management is controversial. We hypothesized that in TBI patients with AUD, a prolonged bleeding time is associated with more severe injury and poor outcome. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Moderate and severe TBI patients with evidence of AUD were examined with bleeding time according to IVY bleeding time on admission during neurointensive care. Baseline clinical and radiological characteristics were recorded. A standardized IVY bleeding time test was determined by staff trained in the procedure. Bleeding time test results were divided into normal (≤ 600 s), prolonged (> 600 s), and markedly prolonged (≥ 900 s). Normal platelet count (PLT) was defined as > 150,000/μL. This cohort was compared with another group of TBI patients without evidence of AUD. RESULTS: Fifty-two patients with TBI and AUD were identified, and 121 TBI patients without any history of AUD were used as controls. PLT was low in 44.2% and bleeding time was prolonged in 69.2% of patients. Bleeding time values negatively correlated with PLT (p < 0.05). TBI patients with markedly prolonged values (≥ 900 s) had significantly increased hematoma size, and more frequently required intracranial pressure measurement and mechanical ventilation compared with those with bleeding times < 900 s (p < 0.05). Most patients (88%) with low platelet count had prolonged bleeding time. No difference in 6-month outcome between the bleeding time groups was observed (p > 0.05). Subjects with TBI and no evidence for AUD had lower bleeding time values and higher platelet count compared with those with TBI and history of AUD (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Although differences in the bleeding time values between TBI cohorts exist and prolonged values may be seen even in patients with normal platelet count, the bleeding test is a marker of primary hemostasis and platelet function with low specificity. However, it may provide an additional assessment in the interpretation of the overall status of TBI patients with AUD. Therefore, the bleeding time test should only be used in combination with the patient’s bleeding history and careful assessment of other hematologic parameters.","Tsitsopoulos, P.

Average E(L) was increased in adult patients with PAH when compared with the same age group along both MPA-RPA (P = 0.020) and MPA-LPA (P = 0.025) tracts. There were no differences in E(L) indices between adults and pediatric patients. Children and adult patients with PAH have decreased shear hemodynamic forces. However, pathological flow hemodynamic formations appear to be more consistent in adult patients, whereas flow hemodynamic abnormalities appear to be more variable in children with PAH for comparable severity of PVRi. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Both children and adult patients with PAH have decreased shear hemodynamic forces inside the pulmonary arteries associated with the degree of vessel dilation and stiffness. These differences also exist between healthy normotensive children and adults. However, pathological flow hemodynamic formations appear to more uniform in adult patients, whereas in children with PAH flow, hemodynamic abnormalities appear to be more variable. Pathological flow formations appear not to have a major effect on viscous energy loss associated with the flow conduction through proximal pulmonary arteries.","Schäfer, Michal; Ivy, D.

The true burden of the disease is difficult to capture due to the wide range of presentation, from asymptomatic cases to non-respiratory complications such as cardiovascular events, and its seasonal variability. An understanding of the magnitude of the true annual incidence of influenza is important to support prevention and control policy development and to evaluate the impact of preventative measures such as vaccination. METHODS: We use a dynamic disease transmission model, laboratory-confirmed influenza surveillance data, and randomized-controlled trial (RCT) data to quantify the underestimation factor, expansion factor, and symptomatic influenza illnesses in the US and Canada during the 2011-2012 and 2012-2013 influenza seasons. RESULTS: Based on 2 case definitions, we estimate between 0.42−3.2% and 0.33−1.2% of symptomatic influenza illnesses were laboratory-confirmed in Canada during the 2011-2012 and 2012-2013 seasons, respectively. In the US, we estimate between 0.08−0.61% and 0.07−0.33% of symptomatic influenza illnesses were laboratory-confirmed in the 2011-2012 and 2012-2013 seasons, respectively. We estimated the symptomatic influenza illnesses in Canada to be 0.32−2.4 million in 2011-2012 and 1.8−8.2 million in 2012-2013. In the US, we estimate the number of symptomatic influenza illnesses to be 4.4−34 million in 2011-2012 and 23−102 million in 2012-2013. CONCLUSIONS: We illustrate that monitoring a representative group within a population may aid in effectively modelling the transmission of infectious diseases such as influenza. In particular, the utilization of RCTs in models may enhance the accuracy of epidemiological parameter estimation.","McCarthy, Zachary; Athar, Safia; Alavinejad, Mahnaz; Chow, Christopher; Moyles, Iain; Nah, Kyeongah; Kong, Jude D.; Agrawal, Nishant; Jaber, Ahmed; Keane, Laura; Liu, Sam; Nahirniak, Myles; Jean, Danielle St; Romanescu, Razvan; Stockdale, Jessica; Seet, Bruce T.; Coudeville, Laurent; Thommes, Edward; Taurel, Anne-Frieda; Lee, Jason; Shin, Thomas; Arino, Julien; Heffernan, Jane; Chit, Ayman; Wu, Jianhong",Theor Biol Med Model,4,1

In this study, we investigated whether the dietary supplementation of pomegranate seed oil (PSO) exerted a protective effect on liver lipid uptake, fibrosis, and mitochondrial function in a mouse model of obesity and insulin resistance. Method: In this in vivo study, eight-week-old C57BL/6J male mice were fed with a high fat diet (HFD) for 24 weeks and then were divided into three groups as follows: group (1) Lean; group (n = 6) (2) HF diet; group (n = 6) (3) HF diet treated with PSO (40 mL/kg food) (n = 6) for eight additional weeks starting at 24 weeks. Physiological parameters, lipid droplet accumulation, inflammatory biomarkers, antioxidant biomarkers, mitochondrial biogenesis, insulin sensitivity, and hepatic fibrosis were determined to examine whether PSO intervention prevents obesity-associated metabolic syndrome. Results: The PSO group displayed an increase in oxygen consumption, as well as a decrease in fasting glucose and blood pressure (p < 0.05) when compared to the HFD-fed mice group. PSO increased both the activity and expression of hepatic HO-1, downregulated inflammatory adipokines, and decreased hepatic fibrosis. PSO increased the levels of thermogenic genes, mitochondrial signaling, and lipid metabolism through increases in Mfn2, OPA-1, PRDM 16, and PGC1α. Furthermore, PSO upregulated obesity-mediated hepatic insulin receptor phosphorylation Tyr-(972), p-IRB tyr(1146), and pAMPK, thereby decreasing insulin resistance. Conclusions: These results indicated that PSO decreased obesity-mediated insulin resistance and the progression of hepatic fibrosis through an improved liver signaling, as manifested by increased insulin receptor phosphorylation and thermogenic genes. Furthermore, our findings indicate a potential therapeutic role for PSO in the prevention of obesity-associated NAFLD, NASH, and other metabolic disorders.","Raffaele, Marco; Licari, Maria; Amin, Sherif; Alex, Ragin; Shen, Hsin-hsueh; Singh, Shailendra P.; Vanella, Luca; Rezzani, Rita; Bonomini, Francesca; Peterson, Stephen J.; Stec, David E.; Abraham, Nader G.",Int J Mol Sci,4,8

Over the past few decades, an increasing number of studies about bronchoscopy have been published. However, little is known about their qualities and characteristics. METHODS: All of the databases in Web of Science (including the Web of Science Core Collection, BIOSIS Citation Index, KCI-Korean Journal Database, MEDLINE, Russian Science Citation Index, and SciELO Citation Index) were utilized to identify articles published from 1990 to 2020. The top 100 most cited articles about bronchoscopy were selected for degree centrality analysis and analyses regarding publication time, total citation number, the citation density, time-related flux, first author, published journal, geographic origin, and research theme. RESULTS: The selected articles were published mainly in the 2000s and 1990s. Citations per article ranged from 731 to 196. The leading country was the USA, followed by the United Kingdom. The most frequently studied themes were bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and biopsy. The degree centrality analysis connoted that “BAL, inflammation, diagnosis” had a high degree of centrality in the 1990s, while “diagnosis, BAL, biopsy, prospective” took centre stage in the 2000s. CONCLUSIONS: The time, area, and theme distribution of the 100 most cited articles on bronchoscopy have been thoroughly analyzed. It is noticeable that researches based on BAL and endobronchial or transbronchial biopsies currently plays a major role.","He, Boxue; Zhang, Pengfei; Cai, Qidong; Shi, Shuai; Xie, Hui; Zhang, Yuqian; Peng, Xiong; Zhao, Zhenyu; Yin, Wei; Wang, Xiang",BMC Pulm Med,4,8

STUDY DESIGN: In this qualitative study, 111 healthcare professionals participated in patient care simulations and debriefings in a new NICU. Debriefing transcripts were inductively analyzed to characterize LSTs. Unresolved LSTs were identified 1 year after NICU occupancy. RESULTS: Thematic saturation was attained after analysis of nine debriefings. Four major themes affecting staff function and patient safety emerged from 305 threats: relay of information, workplace design, patient care processes, and patient family and staff focus. One-year post occupancy, 29 (9%) LSTs remained unresolved. CONCLUSION: Team debriefings of simulated patient events uncover LSTs that can largely be resolved before transitioning patient care into a new NICU. Understanding how LSTs interact provides a platform to develop viable strategies to mitigate patient safety risks.","Dadiz, Rita; Riccio, Julie; Brown, Kristen; Emrich, Paula; Robin, Beverley; Bender, Jesse",J Perinatol,4,17

However, it is little known about the molecular mechanisms of its antitumor action against osteosarcoma, which is the second highest cause of cancer-related death in children and adolescents. In this study, we investigated the effects of PEITC on K7M2 murine osteosarcoma both in vitro and in vivo. We found that treatment with PEITC dose-dependently inhibited the viability of K7M2 murine osteosarcoma cells with an IC(50) value of 33.49 μM at 24 h. PEITC (1, 15, 30 μM) dose-dependently inhibited the cell proliferation, caused G(2)/M cell cycle arrest, depleted glutathione (GSH), generated reactive oxygen species (ROS), altered iron metabolism, and triggered multiple forms of cell death, namely ferroptosis, apoptosis, and autophagy in K7M2 cells. We further revealed that PEITC treatment activated MAPK signaling pathway, and ROS generation was a major cause of PEITC-induced cell death. In a syngeneic orthotopic osteosarcoma mouse model, administration of PEITC (30, 60 mg/kg every day, ig, for 24 days) significantly inhibited the tumor growth, but higher dose of PEITC (90 mg/kg every day) compromised its anti-osteosarcoma effect. Histological examination showed that multiple cell death processes were initiated, iron metabolism was altered and MAPK signaling pathway was activated in the tumor tissues. In conclusion, we demonstrate that PEITC induces ferroptosis, autophagy, and apoptosis in K7M2 osteosarcoma cells by activating the ROS-related MAPK signaling pathway. PEITC has promising anti-osteosarcoma activity. This study sheds light on the redox signaling-based chemotherapeutics for cancers.","Lv, Huan-huan; Zhen, Chen-xiao; Liu, Jun-yu; Shang, Peng",Acta Pharmacol Sin,4,8

To evaluate the anti-arthritis efficacy and the underlying mechanisms of kaempferol, collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mice were treated with kaempferol intragastrically (200 mg · kg(−1) · d(−1)) and intraperitoneally (20 mg · kg(−1) · d(−1)). Pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic studies showed that the oral administration of kaempferol produced distinct anti-arthritis effects in model mice with arthritis in terms of the spleen index, arthritis index, paw thickness, and inflammatory factors; the bioavailability (1.5%, relative to that of the intraperitoneal injection) and circulatory exposure of kaempferol (C(max) = 0.23 ± 0.06 ng/mL) and its primary metabolite kaempferol-3-O-glucuronide (C(max) = 233.29 ± 89.64 ng/mL) were rather low. In contrast, the intraperitoneal injection of kaempferol caused marginal anti-arthritis effects, although it achieved a much higher in vivo exposure. The much higher kaempferol content in the gut implicated a potential mechanism involved in the gut. Analysis of 16S ribosomal RNA revealed that CIA caused imbalance of 14 types of bacteria at the family level, whereas kaempferol largely rebalanced the intestinal microbiota in CIA mice. A metabolomics study showed that kaempferol treatment significantly reversed the perturbation of metabolites involved in energy production and the tryptophan, fatty acid and secondary bile acid metabolisms in the gut contents of the CIA mice. In conclusion, we demonstrate for the first time that the high level of kaempferol in the gut regulates the intestinal flora and microbiotic metabolism, which are potentially responsible for the anti-arthritis activities of kaempferol.","Aa, Li-xiang; Fei, Fei; Qi, Qi; Sun, Run-bin; Gu, Sheng-hua; Di, Zi-zhen; Aa, Ji-ye; Wang, Guang-ji; Liu, Chang-xiao",Acta Pharmacol Sin,4,1

Although the physiopathology of SP and PV is distinct, patients with these diseases share similar symptoms. The early differential diagnosis may improve the quality of life and decrease the disease burden in PV patients, as well as enable curative treatment for SP patients. PV is considered an oncoinflammatory disease because PV patients exhibit augmented levels of several pro-inflammatory cytokines. In this sense, we examined whether analysis of the cytokine production profile of SP and PV patients would help to distinguish them, despite their clinical similarities. Here we reported that SP patients exhibited decreased plasma levels of, IL-17A, IFN-γ, IL-12p70 and TNF-α when compared with PV patients, suggesting that analysis of the cytokine production profile may be an useful diagnostic biomarker to distinguish PV from SP patients.","Cacemiro, Maira da Costa; Cominal, Juçara Gastaldi; Berzoti-Coelho, Maria Gabriela; Tognon, Raquel; Nunes, Natalia de Souza; Simões, Belinda; Pereira, Ítalo Sousa; Carlos, Daniela; Faccioli, Lucia Helena; Figueiredo-Pontes, Lorena Lobo de; Frantz, Fabiani Gai; Castro, Fabíola Attié de",Sci Rep,4,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective case–control study included 54 eyes (the XFS-affected and the fellow eyes) of 27 unilateral XFS patients and 27 eyes of 27 age-matched control subjects. The RNFL and GCC thicknesses were measured using SD-OCT (RT-Vue 100, Optovue, Fremont, CA) after pupillary dilation. RNFL and GCC thicknesses were compared between case and control groups. RESULTS: The mean age of XFS patients was 73.3 years and that of age-matched controls was 74.3 years. Both groups demonstrated a male preponderance. Superior RNFL thickness of XFS-affected eyes were significantly thinner than those of the healthy age-matched controls (P = 0.002 by ANOVA). There were no statistically significant differences in the RNFL thickness between both eyes of unilateral XFS patients. Moreover, superior GCC thickness of both eyes in unilateral XFS patients were thinner than those in controls (P = 0.002 by ANOVA). CONCLUSIONS: Thinner RNFL and GCC thicknesses were observed in unilateral XFS patients without visual field defects. These findings imply that XFS itself might be a risk factor for development of glaucomatous optic disc and RNFL damage.","Lim, Su-Ho; Gu, Won Mo; Cha, Soon Cheol",Eye (Lond),4,1

This burden is characterized by wide-spread geographical variation within the country. This paper explores two research questions: (i) are the drivers of severe and moderate stunting similar? (ii) differential endowments or policy-effect, how do community-level nutrition and sanitary practices affect inter-state differences? Using data from Indian National Family and Health Survey 4, 2015–16, six states holding different ranks in the stunting continuum are compared to Tamil Nadu, taken as the benchmark state due to its laudable performance in the health care sector. Applying quantile regression approaches, the difference in state-level performance is decomposed into detailed covariate effects (differential endowments) and coefficient effects (differential strength of association between the drivers and outcome). The explanatory variables are not similarly associated with severe and moderate stunting. Decomposition results demonstrate a significant role of community-level sanitation practices compared to child nutrition behaviour in explaining the inter-state disparity. Coefficient effects play a dominant role in the lower tail of HAZ distribution for the poor performing states indicating that the worse outcomes of these states are due to weaker policy effects of the control variables on stunting. Multi-sectoral approach, identification and differentiation between severe and moderate stunting cases can be more instrumental in managing and reducing the scourge. This paper also advocates the potential benefits of customizing centrally-launched policies as per the state’s performance and introducing the concept coproduction in the existing nutrition and health policy framework. This will instigate a feeling of ownership of the problem of childhood stunting among the policy consumers and strengthen the influence of policies on the outcomes.","Banerjee, Kajori; Dwivedi, Laxmi Kant",PLoS One,4,1

In this study we investigated whether NADPH exerted cardioprotection against myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. To induce myocardial I/R injury, rats were subjected to ligation of the left anterior descending branch of coronary artery for 30 min followed by reperfusion for 2 h. At the onset of reperfusion, NADPH (4, 8, 16 mg· kg(−1)· d(−1), iv) was administered to the rats. We found that NADPH concentrations in plasma and heart were significantly increased at 4 h after intravenous administration. Exogenous NADPH (8−16 mg/kg) significantly decreased myocardial infarct size and reduced serum levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and cardiac troponin I (cTn-I). Exogenous NADPH significantly decreased the apoptotic rate of cardiomyocytes, and reduced the cleavage of PARP and caspase-3. In addition, exogenous NADPH reduced mitochondrial vacuolation and increased mitochondrial membrane protein COXIV and TOM20, decreased BNIP3L and increased Bcl-2 to protect mitochondrial function. We conducted in vitro experiments in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCM) subjected to oxygen–glucose deprivation/restoration (OGD/R). Pretreatment with NADPH (60, 500 nM) significantly rescued the cell viability and inhibited OGD/R-induced apoptosis. Pretreatment with NADPH significantly increased the phosphorylation of AMPK and downregulated the phosphorylation of mTOR in OGD/R-treated NRCM. Compound C, an AMPK inhibitor, abolished NADPH-induced AMPK phosphorylation and cardioprotection in OGD/R-treated NRCM. In conclusion, exogenous NADPH exerts cardioprotection against myocardial I/R injury through the activation of AMPK/mTOR pathway and inhibiting mitochondrial damage and cardiomyocyte apoptosis. NADPH may be a potential candidate for the prevention and treatment of myocardial ischemic diseases.","Zhu, Jiang; Wang, Yi-fei; Chai, Xiao-ming; Qian, Ke; Zhang, Ling-wei; Peng, Peng; Chen, Pei-min; Cao, Jian-fang; Qin, Zheng-hong; Sheng, Rui; Xie, Hong",Acta Pharmacol Sin,4,1

Icariside II (ICS II) is an active component isolated from a traditional Chinese herb Epimedium, which has shown to attnuate lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced neuroinflammation through regulation of NF-κB signaling pathway. In this study we investigated the effects of ICS II on LPS-induced astrocytes activation and Aβ accumulation. Primary rat astrocytes were pretreated with ICS II (5, 10, and 20 μM) or dexamethasone (DXMS, 1 μM) for 1 h, thereafter, treated with LPS for another 24 h. We found that ICS II pretreatment dose dependently mitigated the levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in the astrocytes. Moreover, ICS II not only exerted the inhibitory effect on LPS-induced IκB-α degradation and NF-κB activation, but also decreased the levels of Aβ(1–40), Aβ(1–42), amyloid precursor protein (APP) and beta secretase 1 (BACE1) in the astrocytes. Interestingly, molecular docking revealed that ICS II might directly bind to BACE1. It is concluded that ICS II has potential value as a new therapeutic agent to treat neuroinflammation-related diseases, such as AD.","Zheng, Yong; Deng, Yan; Gao, Jian-mei; Lv, Chun; Lang, Ling-hu; Shi, Jing-shan; Yu, Chang-yin; Gong, Qi-hai",Acta Pharmacol Sin,4,8

This study aimed to explore the role and mechanism of intestinal epithelial Metrnl in ulcerative colitis. Metrnl(−/−) (intestinal epithelial cell-specific Metrnl knockout) mice did not display any phenotypes of colitis under basal conditions. However, under administration of 3% dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) drinking water, colitis was more severe in Metrnl(−/−) mice than in WT mice, as indicated by comparisons of body weight loss, the presence of occult or gross blood per rectum, stool consistency, shrinkage in the colon, intestinal damage, and serum levels of inflammatory factors. DSS-induced colitis activated autophagy in the colon. This activation was partially inhibited by intestinal epithelial Metrnl deficiency, as indicated by a decrease in Beclin-1 and LC3-II/I and an increase in p62 in DSS-treated Metrnl(−/−) mice compared with WT mice. These phenomena were further confirmed by observation of autophagosomes and immunofluorescence staining for LC3 in epithelial cells. The autophagy-related AMPK-mTOR-p70S6K pathway was also activated in DSS-induced colitis, and this pathway was partially blocked by intestinal epithelial Metrnl deficiency, as indicated by a decrease in AMPK phosphorylation and an increase in mTOR and p70S6K phosphorylation in DSS-treated Metrnl(−/−) mice compared with WT mice. Therefore, Metrnl deficiency deteriorated ulcerative colitis at least partially through inhibition of autophagy via the AMPK-mTOR-p70S6K pathway, suggesting that Metrnl is a therapeutic target for ulcerative colitis.","Zhang, Sai-long; Li, Zhi-yong; Wang, Dong-sheng; Xu, Tian-ying; Fan, Mao-bing; Cheng, Ming-he; Miao, Chao-yu",Acta Pharmacol Sin,4,8

In this study we evaluated the cognition-improving effects of DL0410 in APP/PS1 transgenic mice and explored the underlying mechanisms. APP/PS1 transgenic mice were administered DL0410 (3, 10, 30 mg· kg(−1)· d(−1), ig) for 2 months. We found that DL0410 administration significantly ameliorated cognitive deficits in both the nest-building and Morris water maze tests. In electrophysiological analysis of hippocampal slices, we showed that DL0410 administration significantly enhanced the field EPSP slope and HFS-induced LTP in CA1 area. Furthermore, we revealed that DL0410 administration significantly increased the phosphorylation of AKT and the activity of GSK-3β in the hippocampus and cortex. Moreover, DL0410 administration dose-dependently increased the expression level of phosphorylated ERK1/2 in the hippocampus and cortex. In addition, DL0410 dose-dependently decreased the neuronal loss by decreasing the production of Aβ deposition, inhibited glial overactivation, and the production of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6. We conclude that DL0410 ameliorates cognitive deficits in APP/PS1 transgenic mice by promoting synaptic transmission via activating the AKT/GSK-3β and MAPK/ERK signaling pathway and reducing neuronal loss. DL0410 may be an effective agent for AD treatment in the future.","Zhou, Wei; Lian, Wen-wen; Yan, Rong; Jia, Hao; Xu, Lv-jie; Wang, Lin; Liu, Ai-lin; Du, Guan-hua",Acta Pharmacol Sin,4,1

It reaches the central nervous system upon crossing the blood–brain barrier through pathogenic mechanisms that are not completely understood. Here, using a high-throughput siRNA screening assay combined with verification experiments, we found that JEV enters the primary human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC) through a caveolae-mediated endocytic pathway. The role of ezrin, an essential host factor for JEV entry based on our screening, in caveolae-mediated JEV internalization was investigated. We observed that JEV internalization in HBMEC is largely dependent on ezrin-mediated actin cytoskeleton polymerization. Moreover, Src, a protein predicted by a STRING database search, was found to be required in JEV entry. By a variety of pharmacological inhibition and immunoprecipitation assays, we found that Src, ezrin, and caveolin-1 were sequentially activated and formed a complex during JEV infection. A combination of in vitro kinase assay and subcellular analysis demonstrated that ezrin is essential for Src-caveolin-1 interactions. In vivo, both Src and ezrin inhibitors protected ICR suckling mice against JEV-induced mortality and diminished mouse brain viral load. Therefore, JEV entry into HBMEC requires the activation of the Src-ezrin-caveolin-1 signalling axis, which provides potential targets for restricting JEV infection.","Liu, Yan-Gang; Chen, Yang; Wang, Xiaohang; Zhao, Ping; Zhu, Yongzhe; Qi, Zhongtian",,4,1

We expand one of these Cas13a-based methods to detect small molecules in a one-batch assay. Using SHERLOCK-based profiling of in vitrotranscription (SPRINT), in vitro transcribed RNA sequence-specifically triggers the RNase activity of Cas13a. This event activates its non-specific RNase activity, which enables cleavage of an RNA oligonucleotide labeled with a quencher/fluorophore pair and thereby de-quenches the fluorophore. This fluorogenic output can be measured to assess transcriptional output. The use of riboswitches or proteins to regulate transcription via specific effector molecules is leveraged as a coupled assay that transforms effector concentration into fluorescence intensity. In this way, we quantified eight different compounds, including cofactors, nucleotides, metabolites of amino acids, tetracycline and monatomic ions in samples. In this manner, hundreds of reactions can be easily quantified in a few hours. This increased throughput also enables detailed characterization of transcriptional regulators, synthetic compounds that inhibit transcription, or other coupled enzymatic reactions. These SPRINT reactions are easily adaptable to portable formats and could therefore be used for the detection of analytes in the field or at point-of-care situations.","Iwasaki, Roman S; Batey, Robert T",Nucleic Acids Res,4,1

To understand the service quality in intensive care units (ICUs), we investigated the expected and perceived service quality of ICU care. METHODS: We conducted this study at an ICU of a university-affiliated medical center in Taiwan from April to September 2019. Admitted patients or their family members responded to a questionnaire survey adopted from the SERVQUAL instrument consisting of 22 items in five dimensions. The questionnaire was provided on ICU admission for expectation and before ICU discharge for perception. We analyzed the quality gaps between the surveys and applied important-performance analysis (IPA). RESULTS: A total of 117 patients were included (62.4% males, average age: 65.9 years, average length of stay: 10.1 days, and 76.9% survival to ICU discharge). The overall weighted mean scores for the surveys were similar (4.57 ± 0.81 and 4.58 ± 0.52, respectively). The ‘tangibles’ dimension had a higher perception than expectation (3.99 ± 0.55 and 4.31 ± 0.63 for expectation and perception, respectively, p < 0.001). IPA showed that most of the items in ‘reliability,’ ‘responsiveness’ and ‘assurance’ were located in the quadrant of high expectation and high perception, whereas most of the items in ‘tangibles’ and ‘empathy’ were located in the quadrant of low expectation and low perception. One item (item 1 for ‘tangibles’) was found in the quadrant of high expectation and low perception. CONCLUSIONS: The SERVQUAL approach and IPA might provide useful information regarding the feedback by patients and their families for ICU service quality. In most aspects, the performance of the ICU satisfactorily matched the needs perceived by the patients and their families.","Lu, Shu-Ju; Kao, Hsiu-O; Chang, Bao-Lin; Gong, Shu-Ing; Liu, Shu-Mei; Ku, Shih-Chi; Jerng, Jih-Shuin",BMC Health Serv Res,4,8

Any disruption of iron homeostasis leads to either iron deficiency or iron overload, which can be detrimental for humans’ health, especially in elderly. Each of these changes contributes to the faster development of many neurological disorders or stimulates progression of already present diseases. Age-related cellular and molecular alterations in iron metabolism can also lead to iron dyshomeostasis and deposition. Iron deposits can contribute to the development of inflammation, abnormal protein aggregation, and degeneration in the central nervous system (CNS), leading to the progressive decline in cognitive processes, contributing to pathophysiology of stroke and dysfunctions of body metabolism. Besides, since iron plays an important role in both neuroprotection and neurodegeneration, dietary iron homeostasis should be considered with caution. Recently, there has been increased interest in sex-related differences in iron metabolism and iron homeostasis. These differences have not yet been fully elucidated. In this review we will discuss the latest discoveries in iron metabolism, age-related changes, along with the sex differences in iron content in serum and brain, within the healthy aging population and in neurological disorders such as multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, and stroke.","Grubić Kezele, Tanja; Ćurko-Cofek, Božena",Nutrients,4,1

However, there are no sufficient studies dealing with their modes of action. Herein, we investigate an in-house library of common plant-based phenolic compounds for their potential antibacterial effects against the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), a widespread life-threatening superbug. Flavonoids, which are considered major constituents in the plant kingdom, were found to be a promising class of compounds against MRSA, particularly the non-glycosylated ones. On the other hand, the glycosylated derivatives, along with the flavonolignan silibinin A, were able to restore the inhibitory activity of ampicillin against MRSA. To explore the mode of action of this class, they were subjected to an extensive inverse virtual screening (IVS), which suggested penicillin-binding protein 2a (PBP2a) as a possible target that mediates both the antibacterial and the antibiotic-synergistic effects of this class of compounds. Further molecular docking and molecular dynamic simulation experiments were conducted to support the primary IVS and the in vitro results and to study their binding modes with PBP2a. Our findings shed a light on plant-derived natural products, notably flavonoids, as a promising and readily available source for future adjuvant antimicrobial therapy against resistant strains.","Alhadrami, Hani A.; Hamed, Ahmed A.; Hassan, Hossam M.; Belbahri, Lassaad; Rateb, Mostafa E.; Sayed, Ahmed M.",Antibiotics (Basel),4,1

Whether or not reviews and original articles have a higher impact factor than case reports is a point for verification in this study. In addition, article topics that can be used for predicting citations have not been analyzed. Thus, this study aims to: (1).. provide a visualization dashboard for the 100 top-cited articles related to article types and (2).. inspect major medical subject headings (i.e., MeSH terms in PubMed) to help predict citations. METHODS: We searched PubMed Central and downloaded 100 top-cited abstracts in the journal Medicine (Baltimore) since 2011. Four article types and 7 topic categories (denoted by MeSH terms) were extracted from abstracts. Contributors to these 100 top-cited articles were analyzed. Social network analysis and Sankey diagram analysis were performed to identify influential article types and topic categories. MeSH terms were applied to predict the number of article citations. We then examined the prediction power with the correlation coefficients between MeSH weights and article citations. RESULTS: The citation counts for the 100 articles ranged from 24 to 127, with an average of 39.1 citations. The most frequent article types were journal articles (82%) and comparative studies (10%), and the most frequent topics were epidemiology (48%) and blood and immunology (36%). The most productive countries were the United States (24%) and China (23%). The most cited article (PDID = 27258521) with a count of 135 was written by Dr Shang from Shandong Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University (China) in 2016. MeSH terms were evident in the prediction power of the number of article citations (correlation coefficients = 0.49, t = 5.62). CONCLUSION: The breakthrough was made by developing dashboards showing the overall concept of the 100 top-cited articles using the Sankey diagram. MeSH terms can be used for predicting article citations. Analyzing the 100 top-cited articles could help future academic pursuits and applications in other academic disciplines.","Kuo, Yu-Chi; Chien, Tsair-Wei; Kuo, Shu-Chun; Yeh, Yu-Tsen; Lin, Jui-Chung John; Fong, Yao",Medicine (Baltimore),4,19

The mechanism underlying such toxicity remains poorly understood, hence the absence of effective intervention strategies. In the present study, we show that vascular endothelial cells are the primary cellular target of sorafenib-induced HFSR wherein soluble heparin-binding epidermal growth factor (s-HBEGF) mediates the crosstalk between vascular endothelial cells and keratinocytes. Mechanistically, s-HBEGF released from vascular endothelial cells activates the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) on keratinocytes and promotes the phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase 2 (JNK2), which stabilizes sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), an essential keratinization inducer, and ultimately gives rise to HFSR. The administration of s-HBEGF in vivo could sufficiently induce hyper-keratinization without sorafenib treatment. Furthermore, we report that HBEGF neutralization antibody, Sirt1 knockdown, and a classic SIRT1 inhibitor nicotinamide could all significantly reduce the sorafenib-induced HFSR in the mouse model. It is noteworthy that nicotinic acid, a prodrug of nicotinamide, could substantially reverse the sorafenib-induced HFSR in ten patients in a preliminary clinical study. Collectively, our findings reveal the mechanism of vascular endothelial cell-promoted keratinization in keratinocytes and provide a potentially promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of sorafenib-induced HFSR.","Luo, Peihua; Yan, Hao; Chen, Xueqin; Zhang, Ying; Zhao, Ziying; Cao, Ji; Zhu, Yi; Du, Jiangxia; Xu, Zhifei; Zhang, Xiaochen; Zeng, Su; Yang, Bo; Ma, Shenglin; He, Qiaojun",Cell Res,4,8

In this study, we focus on one specific susceptibility CNV disorder, 16p11.2 deletion syndrome. This rare condition is characterised by an increased risk of mild intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, epilepsy, and obesity. We aimed to explore the impact of such a disorder on the family members involved in the daily care of children with this syndrome. Three focus group discussions were held with 23 Dutch (grand)parents. Thematic analysis was performed by two independent researchers. The following five themes emerged: (1) the end of a diagnostic odyssey and response to the diagnosis, (2) after the diagnosis—life with a child with 16p11.2 deletion syndrome, (3) access to medical care and support services, (4) nobody knows what 16p11.2 deletion syndrome is, and (5) future perspective—ideal care. The participants experienced a lack of knowledge among involved professionals. Together with the large variability of the syndrome, this led to fragmented care and unfulfilled needs regarding healthcare, social, and/or educational assistance.

It also assessed if the presence of these features were associated with decreased peripapillary retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) thickness. METHODS: Retrospective observational study of children with ODD. All subjects underwent complete ophthalmic examination and multimodal imaging. ODD were identified on EDI-OCT as circumscribed hyporeflective spheroidal elements located in front of lamina cribrosa, fully or partially surrounded by a hyperreflective border. PHOMS were identified as hyperreflective ovoid structures located in the peripapillary circumference. Both associations between ODD and RNFL loss and PHOMS and RNFL loss were tested using chi-squared test. RESULTS: In total, 38 eyes of 20 children were analysed. PHOMS were present in 90% of patients. ODD and PHOMS were predominantly found in the nasal, superonasal and inferonasal sectors. A significant positive association was found between ODD and decreased RNFL thickness in the nasal (p = 0.02), superonasal (p = 0.05) and inferotemporal (p = 0.04) sectors. There was no significant association found with the presence of PHOMS. CONCLUSION: EDI-OCT allowed morphological analysis of ODD and PHOMS in children. Drusen were found to be distinct from PHOMS both in their appearance and impact on the RNFL. ODD are hyporeflective and appear on the ONH above the lamina cribrosa and were associated with decreased thickness of the RNFL. On the contrary, PHOMS are hyperreflective structures located around the ONH and were not associated with RNFL loss.","Teixeira, Filipa Jorge; Marques, Raquel Esteves; Mano, Sofia Sousa; Couceiro, Rita; Pinto, Filomena",Eye (Lond),4,8

P-glycoprotein prevents cellular uptake of a large number of structurally and functionally diverse compounds, including most cancer therapeutics and in this way causes multidrug resistance (MDR). To overcome MDR, and thus improve cancer treatment, an understanding of P-glycoprotein inhibition at the molecular level is required. With this goal in mind, we propose rules that predict whether a compound is a modulator, substrate, inhibitor, or inducer of P-glycoprotein. This new set of rules is derived from a quantitative analysis of the drug binding and transport properties of P-glycoprotein. We further discuss the role of P-glycoprotein in immune surveillance and cell metabolism.

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort analysis of national datasets with application of standard UK costings. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: All people who died in Scotland in 2016 aged 18 or older (N=56 407). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Frequency of use of the five unscheduled NHS services in the last 12 months of life by underlying cause of death, patient demographics, Continuous Unscheduled Pathways (CUPs) followed by patients during each care episode, total NHS and per-patient costs. RESULTS: 53 509 patients (94.9%) had at least one contact with an unscheduled care service during their last year of life (472 360 contacts), with 34.2% in the last month of life. By linking patient contacts during each episode of care, we identified 206 841 CUPs, with 133 980 (64.8%) starting out-of-hours. People with cancer were more likely to contact the NHS telephone advice line (63%) (χ(2) (4)=1004, p<0.001) or primary care out-of-hours (62%) (χ(2) (4)=1924, p<0.001) and have hospital admissions (88%) (χ(2) (4)=2644, p<0.001). People with organ failure (79%) contacted the ambulance service most frequently (χ(2) (4)=584, p<0.001). Demographic factors associated with more unscheduled care were older age, social deprivation, living in own home and dying of cancer. People dying with organ failure formed the largest group in the cohort and had the highest NHS costs as a group. The cost of providing services in the community was estimated at 3.9% of total unscheduled care costs despite handling most out-of-hours calls. CONCLUSIONS: Over 90% of people used NHS unscheduled care in their last year of life. Different underlying causes of death and demographic factors impacted on initial access and subsequent pathways of care. Managing more unscheduled care episodes in the community has the potential to reduce hospital admissions and overall costs.","Mason, Bruce; Kerssens, Joannes Joseph; Stoddart, Andrew; Murray, Scott A; Moine, Sébastien; Finucane, Anne M; Boyd, Kirsty",BMJ Open,4,1

Current methods utilised in clinical practice are intermittent and only provide a ‘snapshot’ of fetal wellbeing, thus key signs of fetal demise could be missed. Continuous fetal monitoring (CFM) offers the potential to alleviate these issues by providing an objective and longitudinal overview of fetal status. Various CFM devices exist within literature; this review planned to provide a systematic overview of these devices, and specifically aimed to map the devices’ design, performance and factors which affect this, whilst determining any gaps in development. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted using MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, EMCARE, BNI, Cochrane Library, Web of Science and Pubmed databases. Following the deletion of duplicates, the articles’ titles and abstracts were screened and suitable papers underwent a full-text assessment prior to inclusion in the review by two independent assessors. RESULTS: The literature searches generated 4,885 hits from which 43 studies were included in the review. Twenty-four different devices were identified utilising four suitable CFM technologies: fetal electrocardiography, fetal phonocardiography, accelerometry and fetal vectorcardiography. The devices adopted various designs and signal processing methods. There was no common means of device performance assessment between different devices, which limited comparison. The device performance of fetal electrocardiography was reduced between 28 to 36 weeks’ gestation and during high levels of maternal movement, and increased during night-time rest. Other factors, including maternal body mass index, fetal position, recording location, uterine activity, amniotic fluid index, number of fetuses and smoking status, as well as factors which affected alternative technologies had equivocal effects and require further investigation. CONCLUSIONS: A variety of CFM devices have been developed, however no specific approach or design appears to be advantageous due to high levels of inter-device and intra-device variability.","Tamber, Kajal K.; Hayes, Dexter J.

However, a lack of epidemiological data remains for this pathology, and the performances of the influenza-like illness (ILI) case definitions used for sentinel surveillance have never been evaluated in Senegal. This study aimed to i) assess the performance of three different ILI case definitions, adopted by the WHO, USA-CDC (CDC) and European-CDC (ECDC) and ii) identify clinical factors associated with a positive diagnosis for Influenza in order to develop an algorithm fitted for the Senegalese context. METHODS: All 657 patients with a febrile pathological episode (FPE) between January 2013 and December 2016 were followed in a cohort study in two rural villages in Senegal, accounting for 1653 FPE observations with nasopharyngeal sampling and influenza virus screening by rRT-PCR. For each FPE, general characteristics and clinical signs presented by patients were collected. Sensitivity, Specificity, Positive Predictive Value (PPV) and Negative Predictive Value (NPV) for the three ILI case definitions were assessed using PCR result as the reference test. Associations between clinical signs and influenza infection were analyzed using logistic regression with generalized estimating equations. Sore throat, arthralgia or myalgia were missing for children under 5 years. RESULTS: WHO, CDC and ECDC case definitions had similar sensitivity (81.0%; 95%CI: 77.0–85.0) and NPV (91.0%; 95%CI: 89.0–93.1) while the WHO and CDC ILI case definitions had the highest specificity (52.0%; 95%CI: 49.1–54.5) and PPV (32.0%; 95%CI: 30.0–35.0). These performances varied by age groups. In children < 5 years, the significant predictors of influenza virus infection were cough and nasal discharge. In patients from 5 years, cough, nasal discharge, sore throat and asthenia grade 3 best predicted influenza infection. The addition of “nasal discharge” as a symptom to the WHO case definition decreased sensitivity but increased specificity, particularly in the pediatric population. CONCLUSION: In summary, all three definitions studies (WHO, ECDC & CDC) have similar performance, even by age group. The revised WHO ILI definition could be chosen for surveillance purposes for its simplicity. Symptomatic predictors of influenza virus infection vary according the age group.

Early identification of the metabolic irregularities associated with the disease process may be a key to developing early intervention strategies. Unhealthy lifestyle behaviours are well established drivers of the development of several NCDs, but the impact of such behaviours on health can vary considerably between individuals. How can it be determined if an individual’s unique set of lifestyle behaviours is producing disease? Accumulating evidence suggests that lifestyle-associated activation of oxidative and inflammatory processes is primary driver of the cell and tissue damage which underpins the development of NCDs. However, the benefit of monitoring subclinical inflammation and oxidative activity has not yet been established. After reviewing relevant studies in this context, we suggest that quantification of oxidative stress and inflammatory biomarkers during the disease-free prodromal stage of NCD development may have clinical relevance as a timely indicator of the presence of subclinical metabolic changes, in the individual, portending the development of disease. Monitoring markers of oxidative and inflammatory activity may therefore enable earlier and more efficient strategies to both prevent NCD development and/or monitor the effectiveness of treatment.","Seyedsadjadi, Neda; Grant, Ross",Antioxidants (Basel),4,8

They are all multisystem pathologies and share a possible ocular involvement, especially uveitis. We hereby describe selected cases who were referred by ophthalmologists to our internal medicine department for unexplained uveitis. Physical examination and/or the use of laboratory and imaging investigations allowed to make a diagnosis of a systemic inflammatory disease in a large proportion of patients. In our tertiary referral center, 75 patients have been diagnosed with Spa (n = 20), BD (n = 9), or sarcoidosis (n = 46) in the last two years. There was a significant delay in the diagnosis of Spa-associated uveitis. Screening strategies using Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)-B27 determination and sacroiliac magnetic resonance imaging in patients suffering from chronic low back pain and/or psoriasis helped in the diagnosis. BD’s uveitis affects young people from both sexes and all origins and usually presents with panuveitis and retinal vasculitis. The high proportion of sarcoidosis in our population is explained by the use of chest computed tomography (CT) and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography CT that helped to identify smaller hilar or mediastinal involvement and allowed to further investigate those patients, especially in the elderly. Our results confirm how in these sight- and potentially life-threatening diseases a prompt diagnosis is mandatory and benefits from a multidisciplinary approach.","El Jammal, Thomas; Loria, Olivier; Jamilloux, Yvan; Gerfaud-Valentin, Mathieu; Kodjikian, Laurent; Sève, Pascal",J Clin Med,4,11

The worldwide distribution characteristic of APPV make it a threat to global swine health. E2 is the major envelope glycoprotein of APPV and the crucial target for vaccine development. Considering the genetic variability of APPV complete genomes and its E2 gene as well as gaps for codon analysis, a comprehensive analysis of codon usage patterns was performed. Relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) and effective number of codon (ENC) analyses showed that a relatively instable change existed and a slight low codon usage bias (CUB) were displayed in APPV genomes. ENC-plot analysis and correlation analyses of nucleotide compositions and ENC showed that mutation pressure and natural selection both affected the codon usage bias of the APPV and natural selection had a more obvious influence for E2 gene compared with complete genomes. Principal component analysis (PCA) and correlation analyses confirmed the above results. Correlation analyses between Gravy and Aromaticity values and the codon bias showed that natural selection played an important role in shaping the synonymous codon bias. Furthermore, neutrality plot analysis showed that natural selection was the main force while mutation pressure was a minor force influencing the codon usage pattern of the APPV E2 gene and complete genomes. The results could illustrate the codon usage patterns of APPV genomes and provided valuable basic data for further fundamental research of evolution of APPV.

Despite the speculated importance of dysbiosis of the microbiome in ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), only few studies have been performed in invasively ventilated ICU patients. And only the results of small cohorts have been published. An overlap exists between bacterial populations observed in the lower respiratory tract and the oropharyngeal tract. The bacterial microbiota is characterized by relatively abundant bacteria difficult to cultivate by standard methods. Under mechanical ventilation, a dysbiosis occurs with a drop overtime in diversity. During VAP development, lung dysbiosis is characterized by a shift towards a dominant bacterial pathogen (mostly Proteobacteria) whereas enrichment of gut-associated bacteria mainly Enterobacteriaceae is the specific feature discriminating ARDS patients. However, the role of this dysbiosis in VAP and ARDS pathogenesis is not yet fully understood. A more in-depth analysis of the interplay between bacteria, virus and fungi and a better understanding of the host-microbiome interaction could provide a more comprehensive view of the role of the microbiome in VAP and ARDS pathogenesis. Priority should be given to validate a consensual and robust methodology for respiratory microbiome research and to conduct longitudinal studies. A deeper understanding of microbial interplay should be a valuable guide for care of ARDS and VAP preventive/therapeutic strategies. We present a review on the current knowledge and expose perspectives and potential clinical applications of respiratory microbiome research in mechanically ventilated patients.

This study aimed to examine the efficacy and safety profile of edoxaban in women versus men. METHODS: The ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 trial (Effective Anticoagulation with Factor Xa Next Generation in Atrial Fibrillation-Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 48) randomly assigned 21 105 patients (8040 women) with atrial fibrillation and CHADS(2) score ≥2 either to a higher-dose edoxaban regimen, a lower-dose edoxaban regimen, or warfarin. The primary end points of the trial were the composite of stroke or systemic embolic events (efficacy), and International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis–defined major bleeding (safety). RESULTS: In comparison with men, women were older, had lower body weight, were more likely to have hypertension and renal dysfunction, but less likely to smoke, drink alcohol, or have diabetes or coronary artery disease. Pretreatment endogenous factor Xa activity was significantly higher in women than in men (92.5% versus 86.1%, P<0.001). Treatment with edoxaban in women resulted in greater peak edoxaban concentration and inhibition of endogenous factor Xa in comparison with men, resulting in similar endogenous factor Xa activity between the sexes 2 to 4 hours after dose. Treatment with higher-dose edoxaban regimen (versus warfarin) resulted in similar reduction in the risk of stroke/systemic embolic events (women: hazard ratio [HR], 0.87 [0.69–1.11], men: HR, 0.87 [0.71–1.06]; P-interaction=0.97) and major bleeding (women: HR, 0.74 [0.59–0.92], men: HR, 0.84 [0.72–0.99]; P-interaction=0.34) in women and men. However, women assigned to higher-dose edoxaban regimen experienced greater reductions in hemorrhagic stroke (HR, 0.30 [95% CI, 0.15–0.59] versus HR, 0.70 [95% CI, 0.46–1.06]), intracranial bleeding (HR, 0.20 [95% CI, 0.10–0.39] versus HR, 0.63 [95% CI, 0.44–0.89]), and life-threatening or fatal bleeding (HR, 0.25 [95% CI, 0.15–0.42] versus HR, 0.72 [95% CI, 0.54–0.96]) than men (each P-interaction<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Despite many differences in baseline characteristics between women and men and higher baseline endogenous factor Xa levels in women, the intensity of anticoagulation achieved with edoxaban between the sexes was similar. Treatment with higher-dose edoxaban regimen resulted in an even greater reduction in hemorrhagic stroke and several serious bleeding outcomes in women than in men, whereas the efficacy profile was similar between sexes.","Zelniker, Thomas A.; Ardissino, Maddalena; Andreotti, Felicita; O’Donoghue, Michelle L.; Yin, Ophelia; Park, Jeong-Gun; Murphy, Sabina A.; Ruff, Christian T.; Lanz, Hans J.; Antman, Elliott M.; Braunwald, Eugene; Giugliano, Robert P.; Merlini, Piera Angelica",Circulation,4,1

A paper and a Google Form platform were used in conducting a survey in Central Italy (the Abruzzo region), by performing an analysis on different points of view as reported by people with disabilities and dentists. The results showed that only 69.2% of dentists treat persons with disabilities. Of these, 73.5% treat less than 10 patients with physical disabilities per year.

On the other hand, 49.1% of people with disabilities (or their caregivers in cases where the patient was unable to answer) report that they rarely or never go to the dental office. Moreover, when they do go, it is mainly for emergencies. Despite this, respondents are well aware of their dental problems. However, they have difficulties in communicating their dental problems to their dentist. The 50% of dentists who treat people with cognitive impairment do not include them in follow-up, while only 20% of these patients reported being regularly recalled.

Previous apelin peptide studies have highlighted the potential for APJ (apelin receptor) agonism to enhance cardiac function in heart failure. However, apelin’s short half-life limits its therapeutic utility. Here, we describe the preclinical characterization of a novel, orally bioavailable APJ agonist, BMS-986224. METHODS: BMS-986224 pharmacology was compared with (Pyr(1)) apelin-13 using radio ligand binding and signaling pathway assays downstream of APJ (cAMP, phosphorylated ERK [extracellular signal-regulated kinase], bioluminescence resonance energy transfer–based G-protein assays, β-arrestin recruitment, and receptor internalization). Acute effects on cardiac function were studied in anesthetized instrumented rats. Chronic effects of BMS-986224 were assessed echocardiographically in the RHR (renal hypertensive rat) model of cardiac hypertrophy and decreased cardiac output. RESULTS: BMS-986224 was a potent (Kd=0.3 nmol/L) and selective APJ agonist, exhibiting similar receptor binding and signaling profile to (Pyr(1)) apelin-13. G-protein signaling assays in human embryonic kidney 293 cells and human cardiomyocytes confirmed this and demonstrated a lack of signaling bias relative to (Pyr(1)) apelin-13. In anesthetized instrumented rats, short-term BMS-986224 infusion increased cardiac output (10%–15%) without affecting heart rate, which was similar to (Pyr(1)) apelin-13 but differentiated from dobutamine. Subcutaneous and oral BMS-986224 administration in the RHR model increased stroke volume and cardiac output to levels seen in healthy animals but without preventing cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis, effects differentiated from enalapril. CONCLUSIONS: We identify a novel, potent, and orally bioavailable nonpeptidic APJ agonist that closely recapitulates the signaling properties of (Pyr(1)) apelin-13. We show that oral APJ agonist administration induces a sustained increase in cardiac output in the cardiac disease setting and exhibits a differentiated profile from the renin-angiotensin system inhibitor enalapril, supporting further clinical evaluation of BMS-986224 in heart failure.","Gargalovic, Peter; Wong, Pancras; Onorato, Joelle; Finlay, Heather; Wang, Tao; Yan, Mujing; Crain, Earl; St-Onge, Stéphane; Héroux, Madeleine; Bouvier, Michel; Xu, Carrie; Chen, Xue-Qing; Generaux, Claudia; Lawrence, Michael; Wexler, Ruth; Gordon, David",Circ Heart Fail,4,8

Complement system and pyroptosis have been proved to be involved in ALI, and inhibition of C5a/C5a receptor (C5aR) could alleviate ALI. This study aimed to investigate whether C5a/C5aR inhibition could protect against LPS-induced ALI via mediating pyroptosis. Rats were assigned into four groups: Control, LPS, LPS+W-54011 1mg/kg, and LPS+W-54011 5mg/kg. Beas-2B cells pretreated with or without C5a and W-54011, alone and in combination, were challenged with LPS+ATP. Results unveiled that LPS caused lung tissue injury and inflammatory response, increased pyroptotic and apoptotic factors, along with elevated C5a concentration and C5aR expressions. However, W-54011 pretreatment alleviated lung damage and pulmonary edema, reduced inflammation and prevented cell pyroptosis. In vitro studies confirmed that LPS+ATP reduced cell viability, promoted cell death, generated inflammatory factors and promoted expressions of pyroptosis-related proteins, which could be prevented by W-54011 pretreatment while intensified by C5a pretreatment. The co-treatment of C5a and W-54011 could blunt the effects of C5a on LPS+ATP-induced cytotoxicity. In conclusion, inhibition of C5a/C5aR developed protective effects against LPS-induced ALI and the cytotoxicity of Beas-2B cells, and these effects may depend on blocking pyroptosis.","Wang, Renying; Wang, Yunxing; Hu, Lan; Lu, Zhenbing; Wang, Xiaoshan",Aging (Albany NY),4,1

METHOD: A multicenter, randomized, open-label, and active-controlled clinical trial, with a 12-month follow-up. Outpatients with schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder were randomized either to the experimental group—studied by spirometry and informed of their calculated lung age and degree of obstruction (if any)—or to the active control group, who followed the 5 A’s intervention. RESULTS: The study sample consisted of 160 patients (71.9% SZ), 78.1% of whom completed the 12-month follow-up. Of the patients who completed the spirometry test, 23.9% showed evidence of COPD (77.8% in moderate or severe stages).

Although liposomes can be considered as promising vaccines, the activity of phospholipase-A (PLA) in WLL, breeds difficulties to preparing stable liposomal WLL. One strategy to overcome this shortcoming is to use lipids such as sphingomyelin (SM) which is resistant against PLA. This study aim is formulating stable SM liposomes containing WLL and comparing their adjuvant effects with another first generation vaccine , i.e. solube Leishmania Antigen (SLA) liposomes in BALB/c mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: BALB/c mice were immunized subcutaneously, three times with 2-week intervals, with Empty-liposome (E-lipo), Particulate WLL, Liposome-WLL, Liposome-SLA and control Buffer, three times every 2-week. Protection was assessed through measuring the swollen footpads and the load of parasites in the spleen. Other factors were used to assess the response of immune system by means of IgG subclasses, IL-4 and IFN-γ levels and intracellular cytokine assay in cultured splenocytes. RESULTS: Although liposomal WLL were stable in terms of physicochemical properties, mice received Liposome-WLL did not reduce footpad swelling. The load of parasites in spleen and levels of IL-4- were also higher compared to other immunized groups. In terms of IgG isotypes, no considerable difference observed in mice received Liposome-WLL or other formulations. CONCLUSION: Liposome-WLL could be a suitable vaccine delivery system when a Th2 response is desired. Also, further studies are warranted to fully understand the role of sphingomyelin in inducing an immune response.","Biari, Nazanin; Alavizadeh, Seyedeh Hoda; Chavoshian, Omid; Abbasi, Azam; Saberi, Zahra; Jalali, Seyed Amir; Khamesipoure, Ali; Jaafari, Mahmoud Reza; Badiee, Ali",Iran J Basic Med Sci,4,1

It responds to harmful alcohol consumption with early intervention (reactive module) and builds strategic prevention networks on a community level (proactive module). It was initiated in 2003 by the Villa Schöpflin gGmbH. HaLT was one of the first programs funded by the German Prevention Act (PrävG), which came into force in 2015. Since March 2018, the program has been developed further and the respective innovations are described in a framework concept. This article presents the program, its network, and the updated concept. There are 152 HaLT sites in Germany; primarily, the covered regions are counties and (district-free) cities. One aim of the further development is to modularize the program prevention measures for funding and to implement a specific quality management (QM) concept. Additionally, there is a development with regard to new topics and target groups, including young people who consume alcohol and illegal drugs and young adults between 18 and 21 years old. Another example is a classroom workshop in secondary schools that addresses the prevention of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD).

When the disease re-emerged in 2018 in Japan, a CSF-infected wild boar was reported shortly after the initial pig farm outbreak; subsequently, the disease spread widely. To control the disease spread among wild boars, intensive capturing, fencing, and oral bait vaccination were implemented with concomitant virological and serological surveillance. This study aimed to describe the disease spread in the wild boar population in Japan from September 2018, when the first case was reported, to March 2020, based on the surveillance data. We conducted statistical analyses using a generalized linear mixed model to identify factors associated with CSF infection among wild boars. Moreover, we descriptively assessed the effect of oral bait vaccination, which started in March 2019 in some municipalities in the affected areas. RESULTS: We observed a faster CSF infection spread in the wild boar population in Japan compared with the CSF epidemics in European countries. The infection probability was significantly higher in dead and adult animals. The influence of the multiple rounds of oral bait vaccination was not elucidated by the statistical modeling analyses. There was a decrease and increase in the proportion of infected and immune animals, respectively; however, the immunization in piglets remained insufficient after vaccination for 1 year. CONCLUSIONS: Conditions regarding the wild boar habitat, including forest continuity, higher wild boar population density, and a larger proportion of susceptible piglets, were addressed to increase the infection risk in the wild boar population. These findings could improve the national control strategy against the CSF epidemic among wild boars.

We used molecular examinations to develop a decision tree to predict atypical pathogens with CAP and to examine the prevalence of macrolide resistance in Mycoplasma pneumoniae. We conducted a prospective observational study of patients aged ≥ 18 years who had fever and respiratory symptoms and were diagnosed with CAP in one of two community hospitals between December 2016 and October 2018. We assessed combinations of clinical variables that best predicted atypical pathogens with CAP by classification and regression tree (CART) analysis. Pneumonia was defined as respiratory symptoms and new infiltration recognized on chest X-ray or chest computed tomography. We analyzed 47 patients (21 females, 44.7%, mean age: 47.6 years). Atypical pathogens were detected in 15 patients (31.9%; 12 Mycoplasma pneumoniae, 3 Chlamydophila pneumoniae). Ten patients carried macrolide resistant Mycoplasma pneumoniae (macrolide resistant rate 83.3%). CART analysis suggested that factors associated with presence of atypical pathogens were absence of crackles, age < 45 years, and LD ≥ 183 U/L (sensitivity 86.7% [59.5, 98.3], specificity 96.9% [83.8, 99.9]). ur simple clinical decision rules can be used to identify primary care patients with CAP that are at risk for atypical pathogens.

The structural consistency between the synthesized and actual image is a key indicator of the quality of the synthesized image, and the region of interest (ROI) of the synthesized image is related to its usability, and these parameters are the two key issues in image synthesis. In this paper, the fusion-ROI patch GAN (Fp(roi)-GAN) model was constructed by incorporating a priori regional feature based on the two-stage cycle consistency mechanism of cycleGAN. This model has improved the tissue contrast of ROI and achieved the pairwise synthesis of high-quality medical images and their corresponding ROIs. The quantitative evaluation results in two publicly available datasets, INbreast and BRATS 2017, show that the synthesized ROI images have a DICE coefficient of 0.981 ± 0.11 and a Hausdorff distance of 4.21 ± 2.84 relative to the original images. The classification experimental results show that the synthesized images can effectively assist in the training of machine learning models, improve the generalization performance of prediction models, and improve the classification accuracy by 4% and sensitivity by 5.3% compared with the cycleGAN method. Hence, the paired medical images synthesized using Fp(roi)-GAN have high quality and structural consistency with real medical images.","Dong, Jiale; Liu, Caiwei; Man, Panpan; Zhao, Guohua; Wu, Yaping; Lin, Yusong",J Healthc Eng,4,8

Our objective was to determine the association between obesity and circulating progenitor cell (CPC) counts—a measure of intrinsic regenerative capacity—in asymptomatic individuals and patients with CAD and its impact on the obesity paradox. APPROACH AND RESULTS: CPCs were enumerated by flow cytometry as CD45(med+) cells expressing CD34+, CD133+, and CXCR4+ epitopes in 672 asymptomatic individuals (50 years of age; 28% obese) and 1277 patients with CAD (66 years of age; 39% obese). The association between obesity and CPCs was analyzed using linear regression models. The association of obesity and CPCs with cardiovascular death/myocardial infarction events over 3.5-year follow-up in patients with CAD was studied using Cox models. Obesity was independently associated with 16% to 34% higher CPC counts (CD34+, CD34+/CD133+, and CD34+/CXCR4+) in asymptomatic individuals. This association was not attenuated by systemic inflammation, insulin resistance, or secretion but partly attenuated by cardiorespiratory fitness and body composition. In patients with CAD, obesity was associated with 8% to 12% higher CPC counts and 30% lower risk of adverse outcomes. Compared with nonobese patients, only obese patients with high CPC counts (CD34+ cells ≥median, 1806 cells/mL) were at a lower risk (hazard ratio, 0.52 [95% CI, 0.31–0.88]), whereas those with low counts (<median) were at a similar risk (hazard ratio, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.48–1.15]). CONCLUSIONS: Obesity is associated with higher CPC counts. The obesity paradox of improved outcomes with obesity in CAD is limited to patients with intact regenerative capacity who have high CPC counts.","Mehta, Anurag; Meng, Qi; Li, Xiaona; Desai, Shivang R.; D’Souza, Melroy S.; Ho, Annie H.; Islam, Shabatun J.; Dhindsa, Devinder S.; Almuwaqqat, Zakaria; Nayak, Aditi; Alkhoder, Ayman A.; Hooda, Ananya; Varughese, Anil; Ahmad, Syed F.; Mokhtari, Ali; Hesaroieh, Iraj; Sperling, Laurence S.; Ko, Yi-An; Waller, Edmund K.; Quyyumi, Arshed A.",Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol,4,1

This study aimed to identify molecular mechanisms that are dysregulated in T2DM-associated ischemic stroke and candidate genes that might serve as biomarkers. METHODS: The top 25% variance genes in the GSE21321 and GSE22255 datasets were analyzed for coexpression. The differentially expressed mRNAs (DEmRs) between patients with T2DM or ischemic stroke and controls were analyzed. Then, the union of overlapping coexpressed genes and overlapping DEmRs was analyzed. The miRNAs differentially expressed in T2DM-associated ischemic stroke were also analyzed. CIBERSORT was used to evaluate the levels of infiltration by immune cells in T2DM-associated stroke. RESULTS: Thirteen coexpression modules were identified in T2DM and 10 in ischemic stroke, and 594 module genes were shared between the two conditions. A total of 4452 mRNAs differentially expressed between T2DM patients and controls were identified, as were 2390 mRNAs differentially expressed between ischemic stroke and controls. The 771 union genes were enriched mainly in immune-related biological functions and signaling pathways. UBE2N, TGFB3, EXOSC1, and VIM were identified as candidate markers. In addition, we identified miR-576-3p as having the most regulatory roles in both T2DM and ischemic stroke. Mast cell activation was significantly down-regulated in T2DM but up-regulated in ischemic stroke. CONCLUSION: These findings provide numerous testable hypotheses about the pathways underlying T2DM-associated ischemic stroke, which may help identify therapeutic targets.","Zhou, Hui; Huang, Liujia; Liang, Lucong; Chen, Liechun; Zou, Chun; Li, Zhenhua; Li, Rongjie; Jian, Chongdong; Zou, Donghua",Int J Gen Med,4,8

The therapeutic effect of conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy is not obvious. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is an ideal modality to fight cancer, and the nature of photosensitizer limits its application in clinical therapy. The aim of this study was to explore a novel mode of drug delivery for the intervention of bile duct cancer. METHODS: Oxaliplatin and photosensitizer HCE6 were loaded with mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) to synthesize Oxaliplatin/HCE6-MSNs (OH-MSNs); the structure of OH-MSNs was characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and dynamic light scattering (DLS), the drug release rate was detected by high performance liquid chromatography; the cellular activity, apoptosis level, and the expression levels of intracellular apoptosis and autophagy-related factors of OH-MSNs on cholangiocarcinoma cells were observed by CCK-8, flow cytometry, colony formation assay, and Western blot; the effects of OH-MSNs on cholangioma growth were observed by mouse tumor formation, immunohistochemistry, and tissue Tunel staining. RESULTS: The release of OH-MSNs to Oxaliplatin was enhanced under acidic conditions; compared with Oxaliplatin or O-MSNs, OH-MSNs showed more potent killing effects against cholangiocarcinoma cells (P<0.05), and exerted notably inhibitory effects on the activity of cholangiocarcinoma cells (P<0.05), promoted their apoptosis (P<0.05), and greatly facilitated the expression of pro-apoptotic factors and autophagic factors in cholangiocarcinoma cells (P<0.05), and markedly inhibited the expression of anti-apoptotic factors and autophagic inhibitory factors (P<0.05); moreover, OH-MSNs could significantly suppress the growth of mouse cholangiocarcinoma (P<0.05) and induce apoptosis of tumor cells compared with Oxaliplatin or O-MSNs (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: MSNs loading greatly increases the killing effect of Oxaliplatin on cholangiocarcinoma cells and upgrades the autophagic level of cholangiocarcinoma cells, while OH-MSNs synthesized by further loading HCE6 have a more apparent killing effect on cholangiocarcinoma cells.","Zhang, Pei-Jian; Liu, Meng-Dong; Fan, Fang-Yong; Liu, Ke-Xia",Front Oncol,4,1

Importantly, we generate IEC-specific Dhx15-knockout mice and demonstrate that DHX15 is required for controlling intestinal inflammation induced by enteric RNA virus rotavirus in suckling mice and reovirus in adult mice in vivo, which owes to impaired IFN-β, IFN-λ3, and IL-18 production in IECs from Dhx15-deficient mice. Mechanistically, DHX15 interacts with NLRP6 to trigger NLRP6 inflammasome assembly and activation for inducing IL-18 secretion in IECs. Collectively, our report reveals critical roles for DHX15 in sensing enteric RNA viruses in IECs and controlling intestinal inflammation.","Xing, Junji; Zhou, Xiaojing; Fang, Mingli; Zhang, Evan; Minze, Laurie J.; Zhang, Zhiqiang",Cell Rep,4,8

METHODS: The survey was conducted between December 2020 and January 2021 and included a sample of 507 participants age 21 and over. The questionnaire included Health Belief Model (HBM) constructs related to food labeling, nutrition habits, media exposure and extent of support for the reform, frequency of using FOP labels, intention to change purchasing and consumption habits in the coming year, and personal details. RESULTS: The study found that 58.5% reported using the FOP labels to some extent. In addition, 70% indicated willingness to change to healthier products in the coming year. The results of the analytical model confirm the validity of the HBM and the other behavioral constructs. In particular, the frequency of using FOP labels increases as the following factors increase: levels of perceived benefits and perceived importance of reading FOP labels, level of perceived importance of healthy nutrition, frequency of conforming to healthy nutrition, and support for the reform. CONCLUSIONS: The study's findings are important for understanding the impact of the new reform and for guiding future complementary actions to increase people’s motivation to use FOP labels.

It is clear that when traveling, tourists often choose places where animals are present. They look for places with wild animals more often. Our article introduces issues concerning the role of farm animals in the creation of agritourism products and the prospects of using animals in agritourism. On the one hand, farm animals are an additional source for people who run agritourism farms and make the stay of tourists in rural areas more attractive. The presence of livestock acts as a magnet, attracting more tourists to these farms and achieving higher returns on agritourism activities. However, among the reasons for the lack of contact with animals in agritourism offerings, farmers indicated: the lack of financial resources and the lack of conditions to provide the animals with adequate maintenance. It is worth introducing farm animals as a tourist attraction in agritourism offerings. ABSTRACT: Animals are an integral part of human life. Currently, they constitute a relevant factor contributing to the tourist experiences of individuals travelling for tourist purposes. Domestic (farm) animals constitute a tourist attraction, are a source of income for individuals running agritourism farms, and render the tourists’ stay in rural areas more attractive. It is important to maintain the welfare of livestock based on principles of sustainability. The authors conducted research among agritourism providers in Wielkopolska Voivodeship. The aim of the survey was to determine whether agritourism farms keep livestock, what species they are, and whether they are important in building an agritourism product and what the prospects are for using animals in agritourism. A questionnaire was used for the study. The use of a variety of animal species facilitates the maintenance of biodiversity on the farm. Our research shows that 57.3% of the analysed agritourism providers included animals. Additionally, we discovered that the presence of livestock acts as a magnet that draws more tourists towards the individuals running agritourism farms and thus causes them to obtain higher profit from the agritourism business. According to the surveyed individuals, the most influential reason for the absence of livestock on their farms was the lack of financial resources and conditions to provide the animals with proper maintenance. Such findings may prompt the introduction of livestock as a tourist attraction in agritourism in other regions.","Jęczmyk, Anna; Uglis, Jarosław; Steppa, Ryszard",Animals (Basel),4,1

Detection of abnormal respiratory sounds with a stethoscope is important in diagnosing respiratory diseases and providing first aid. However, accurate interpretation of respiratory sounds requires clinician’s considerable expertise, so trainees such as interns and residents sometimes misidentify respiratory sounds. To overcome such limitations, we tried to develop an automated classification of breath sounds. We utilized deep learning convolutional neural network (CNN) to categorize 1918 respiratory sounds (normal, crackles, wheezes, rhonchi) recorded in the clinical setting. We developed the predictive model for respiratory sound classification combining pretrained image feature extractor of series, respiratory sound, and CNN classifier. It detected abnormal sounds with an accuracy of 86.5% and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.93. It further classified abnormal lung sounds into crackles, wheezes, or rhonchi with an overall accuracy of 85.7% and a mean AUC of 0.92. On the other hand, as a result of respiratory sound classification by different groups showed varying degree in terms of accuracy; the overall accuracies were 60.3% for medical students, 53.4% for interns, 68.8% for residents, and 80.1% for fellows. Our deep learning-based classification would be able to complement the inaccuracies of clinicians' auscultation, and it may aid in the rapid diagnosis and appropriate treatment of respiratory diseases.","Kim, Yoonjoo; Hyon, YunKyong; Jung, Sung Soo; Lee, Sunju; Yoo, Geon; Chung, Chaeuk; Ha, Taeyoung",Sci Rep,4,11

Photodynamic Therapy (PDT), which works on the principle of light-induced activation of photosensitizers (PS) leading to Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) mediated cancer cell killing has received increased attention as a promising alternative to overcome several limitations of conventional cancer therapies. Compared to conventional therapies, PDT offers the advantages of selectivity, minimal invasiveness, localized treatment, and spatio-temporal control which minimizes the overall therapeutic side effects and can be repeated as needed without interfering with other treatments and inducing treatment resistance. Overall PDT efficacy requires proper planning of various parameters like localization and concentration of PS at the tumor site, light dose, oxygen concentration and heterogeneity of the tumor microenvironment, which can be achieved with advanced imaging techniques. Consequently, there has been tremendous interest in the rationale design of PS formulations to exploit their theranostic potential to unleash the imperative contribution of medical imaging in the context of successful PDT outcomes. Further, recent advances in PS formulations as activatable phototheranostic agents have shown promising potential for finely controlled imaging-guided PDT due to their propensity to specifically turning on diagnostic signals simultaneously with photodynamic effects in response to the tumor-specific stimuli. In this review, we have summarized the recent progress in the development of PS-based multifunctional theranostic agents for biomedical applications in multimodal imaging combined with PDT. We also present the role of different imaging modalities; magnetic resonance, optical, nuclear, acoustic, and photoacoustic in improving the pre-and post-PDT effects. We anticipate that the information presented in this review will encourage future development and design of PSs for improved image-guided PDT for cancer treatment.","Sarbadhikary, Paromita; George, Blassan P.; Abrahamse, Heidi",Theranostics,4,8

Using adenoma-organoid co-cultures, niche-cell depletion, and lineaging tracing, we characterize a functional role of cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2)-dependent signaling, predominantly occurring between tumor-associated monocytes and macrophages (TAMMs) and TrTSCs. We show that TAMMs promote TrTSC proliferation through prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)-PTGER4(EP4) signaling, which enhances β-catenin activity via AKT phosphorylation. Thus, our study shows that the bidirectional crosstalk between TrTSC and TME results in a pro-tumorigenic and immunosuppressive contexture.","He, Xi; Smith, Sarah E.; Chen, Shiyuan; Li, Hua; Wu, Di; Meneses-Giles, Paloma I.; Wang, Yongfu; Hembree, Mark; Yi, Kexi; Zhao, Xia; Guo, Fengli; Unruh, Jay R.; Maddera, Lucinda E.; Yu, Zulin; Scott, Allison; Perera, Anoja; Wang, Yan; Zhao, Chongbei; Bae, KyeongMin; Box, Andrew; Haug, Jeffrey S.; Tao, Fang; Hu, Deqing; Hansen, Darrick M.; Qian, Pengxu; Saha, Subhrajit; Dixon, Dan; Anant, Shrikant; Zhang, Da; Lin, Edward H.; Sun, Weijing; Wiedemann, Leanne M.; Li, Linheng",Cell Rep,4,8
21379,21379,21379,Expression of IL-20 Receptor Subunit β Is Linked to EAE Neuropathology and CNS Neuroinflammation,12.010503,7.841239,2021-09-07,"BACKGROUND: Among people living with HIV (PLHIV), more flexible and sensitive tuberculosis (TB) screening tools capable of detecting both symptomatic and subclinical active TB are needed to (1) reduce morbidity and mortality from undiagnosed TB; (2) facilitate scale-up of tuberculosis preventive therapy (TPT) while reducing inappropriate prescription of TPT to PLHIV with subclinical active TB; and (3) allow for differentiated HIV–TB care. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We used Botswana XPRES trial data for adult HIV clinic enrollees collected during 2012 to 2015 to develop a parsimonious multivariable prognostic model for active prevalent TB using both logistic regression and random forest machine learning approaches. A clinical score was derived by rescaling final model coefficients. The clinical score was developed using southern Botswana XPRES data and its accuracy validated internally, using northern Botswana data, and externally using 3 diverse cohorts of antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naive and ART-experienced PLHIV enrolled in XPHACTOR, TB Fast Track (TBFT), and Gugulethu studies from South Africa (SA). Predictive accuracy of the clinical score was compared with the World Health Organization (WHO) 4-symptom TB screen. Among 5,418 XPRES enrollees, 2,771 were included in the derivation dataset; 67% were female, median age was 34 years, median CD4 was 240 cells/μL, 189 (7%) had undiagnosed prevalent TB, and characteristics were similar between internal derivation and validation datasets. Among XPHACTOR, TBFT, and Gugulethu cohorts, median CD4 was 400, 73, and 167 cells/μL, and prevalence of TB was 5%, 10%, and 18%, respectively. Factors predictive of TB in the derivation dataset and selected for the clinical score included male sex (1 point), ≥1 WHO TB symptom (7 points), smoking history (1 point), temperature >37.5°C (6 points), body mass index (BMI) <18.5kg/m(2) (2 points), and severe anemia (hemoglobin <8g/dL) (3 points). Sensitivity using WHO 4-symptom TB screen was 73%, 80%, 94%, and 94% in XPRES, XPHACTOR, TBFT, and Gugulethu cohorts, respectively, but increased to 88%, 87%, 97%, and 97%, when a clinical score of ≥2 was used. Negative predictive value (NPV) also increased 1%, 0.3%, 1.6%, and 1.7% in XPRES, XPHACTOR, TBFT, and Gugulethu cohorts, respectively, when the clinical score of ≥2 replaced WHO 4-symptom TB screen. Categorizing risk scores into low (<2), moderate (2 to 10), and high-risk categories (>10) yielded TB prevalence of 1%, 1%, 2%, and 6% in the lowest risk group and 33%, 22%, 26%, and 32% in the highest risk group for XPRES, XPHACTOR, TBFT, and Gugulethu cohorts, respectively. At clinical score ≥2, the number needed to screen (NNS) ranged from 5.0 in Gugulethu to 11.0 in XPHACTOR. Limitations include that the risk score has not been validated in resource-rich settings and needs further evaluation and validation in contemporary cohorts in Africa and other resource-constrained settings. CONCLUSIONS: The simple and feasible clinical score allowed for prioritization of sensitivity and NPV, which could facilitate reductions in mortality from undiagnosed TB and safer administration of TPT during proposed global scale-up efforts. Differentiation of risk by clinical score cutoff allows flexibility in designing differentiated HIV–TB care to maximize impact of available resources.","Auld, Andrew F.; Kerkhoff, Andrew D.; Hanifa, Yasmeen; Wood, Robin; Charalambous, Salome; Liu, Yuliang; Agizew, Tefera; Mathoma, Anikie; Boyd, Rosanna; Date, Anand; Shiraishi, Ray W.; Bicego, George; Mathebula-Modongo, Unami; Alexander, Heather; Serumola, Christopher; Rankgoane-Pono, Goabaone; Pono, Pontsho; Finlay, Alyssa; Shepherd, James C.; Ellerbrock, Tedd V.; Grant, Alison D.; Fielding, Katherine",PLoS Med,4,8

However, the precise timing of gut closure in today’s precocious pig is not known. We gavaged piglets immediately after birth and at 1-h after birth with Cy5-labeled Ovalbumin (Cy5-Ova) then harvested their small intestine’s 6–7 h later. To assess localization of Cy5-Ova in the small intestinal epithelial cells, we performed immunohistochemistry using a basolateral surface marker and a recycling endosome marker called pIgR, the late endosomal marker Rab7, and the lysosomal marker LAMP-1. Cy5-Ova co-localized with Rab7 and LAMP-1 in the duodenum and jejunum of 0-h old and 1-h old gavaged piglets, but only in the ileum of 0-h gavaged piglets. These data suggest that movement of Cy5-Ova through the late endosomes to the lysosomes was much reduced in the ileum of 1-h gavaged piglets. Cy5-Ova was largely present in epithelial cell digestive and transport vacuoles, but it did not colocalize with pIgR-positive endosomes in 0-h and 1-h gavaged piglets. Differences in macromolecular uptake across the different regions of the small intestine after only 1-h may be due to prior processing of colostral macromolecules, changes in the intestine due to initiation of colonization by microflora and/or the initiation of gut-closure. Understanding the relationship between the localization of Cy5-Ova and small intestinal permeability may contribute to establishing whether oral vaccination in the newborn can capitalize on the transient permeability before gut closure to promote immune protection.","Deluco, Brodie; Wilson, Heather L.",Vet Res Commun,4,8

Studies have shown that Lycorine has promising anticancer activities with minor side effects. However, the effect of lycorine on the proliferation of RCC cells and its underlying anti-tumor mechanism have not yet been fully elucidated. The human renal cancer cell lines 786-O, A498 and Caki-1 were cultured and treated with different concentrations of lycorine or ferrostatin-1, a ferroptosis inhibitor. Cell viability and colony formation assays were used to measure cell proliferation. The 5-, 12- and 15-HETE hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HETE) and MDA levels, as well as the reduced to oxidized glutathione (GHS/GSSG) ratio, were analyzed. Western blot analysis was used to detect the expression of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) and acyl-CoA synthetase long chain family member 4 (ACSL4), which are key markers of ferroptosis. Transmission electron microscopy was used to observe the morphological features associated with ferroptosis. Lycorine was found to inhibit the proliferation of RCC cells. After lycorine treatment, the expression levels of GPX4 in RCC cells decreased, whereas those of ACSL4 increased. Lycorine induced the expression of 5-HETE, 12-HETE, 15-HETE and MDA in RCC cells, and reduced the GSH/GSSG ratio. In addition, ferrostatin-1 could prevent lycorine-induced ferroptosis in RCC cells.","Du, Yang; Zhao, Hong-Chao; Zhu, Heng-Cheng; Jin, Yao; Wang, Lei",Oncol Lett,4,17

In this study, we evaluated potential toxic effects of TiO(2)NPs exposure on lungs as well as the development of asthma through the ovalbumin (OVA)-induced mouse model of asthma. Furthermore, we also investigated the associated toxic mechanism. TiO(2)NPs caused pulmonary toxicity by exacerbating the inflammatory response, indicated by an increase in the number and level of inflammatory cells and mediators, respectively. OVA-induced asthma exposed mice to TiO(2)NPs led to significant increases in inflammatory mediators, cytokines, and airway hyperresponsiveness compared with those in non-exposed asthmatic mice. This was also accompanied by increased inflammatory cell infiltration and mucus production in the lung tissues. Additionally, TiO(2)NPs decreased the expression of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl2) and the expressions of thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP), phospho-apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1, Bcl2-associated X, and cleaved-caspase 3 were escalated in the lungs of asthmatic mice compared with those in non-exposed asthmatic mice. These responses were consistent with in vitro results obtained using human airway epithelial cells. TiO(2)NPs treated cells exhibited an increase in the mRNA and protein expression of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α with an elevation of TXNIP signaling compared to non-treated cells. Moreover, pathophysiological changes induced by TiO(2)NP treatment were significantly decreased by TXNIP knockdown in airway epithelial cells. Overall, TiO(2)NP exposure induced toxicological changes in the respiratory tract and exacerbated the development of asthma via activation of the TXNIP-apoptosis pathway. These results provide insights into the underlying mechanism of TiO(2)NP-mediated respiratory toxicity.","Lim, Je-Oh; Lee, Se-Jin; Kim, Woong-Il; Pak, So-Won; Moon, Changjong; Shin, In-Sik; Heo, Jeong-Doo; Ko, Je-Won; Kim, Jong-Choon",Int J Mol Sci,4,1

It possesses antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, anti-arthritis, anti-asthmatic, anti-microbial, anti-viral and anti-fungal properties. This review aims to provide an overview of the potential health benefits of curcumin to treat female reproductive disorders, including polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), ovarian failure and endometriosis. Comprehensive information on curcumin was retrieved from electronic databases, which were MEDLINE via EBSCOhost, Scopus and Google Scholar. The available evidence showed that curcumin reduced the high level of androgen in PCOS. Studies in rodents suggest that curcumin resulted in the disappearance of cysts and the appearance of healthy follicles and corpora lutea. Furthermore, animal studies showed curcumin improved the overall function of the ovary in ovarian diseases and reversed the disturbance in oxidative stress parameters. Meanwhile, in vitro and in vivo studies reported the positive effects of curcumin in alleviating endometriosis through anti-inflammatory, anti-proliferative, anti-angiogenic and pro-apoptotic mechanisms. Thus, curcumin possesses various effects on PCOS, ovarian diseases and endometriosis. Some studies found considerable therapeutic effects, whereas others found no effect. However, none of the investigations found curcumin to be harmful. Curcumin clinical trials in endometriosis and ovarian illness are still scarce; thus, future studies need to be conducted to confirm the safety and efficacy of curcumin before it could be offered as a complementary therapy agent.","Kamal, Datu Agasi Mohd; Salamt, Norizam; Yusuf, Allia Najmie Muhammad; Kashim, Mohd Izhar Ariff Mohd; Mokhtar, Mohd Helmy",Nutrients,4,1

No proper study has been carried out in order to find out the environmental burden of toxigenic V. cholerae as well as how temporal and environmental factors associated in driving cholera across the country. METHODS: We tested waste water samples from designated national environment surveillance sites in Pakistan with RT-PCR assay. Multistage sampling technique were utilized for samples collection and for effective sample processing Bag-Mediated Filtration system, were employed. Results were analysed by district and month wise to understand the geographic distribution and identify the seasonal pattern of V. cholera detection in Pakistan. RESULTS: Between May 2019, and February 2020, we obtained and screened 160 samples in 12 districts across Pakistan. Out of 16 sentinel environmental surveillance sites, 15 sites showed positive results against cholera toxigenic gene with mostly lower CT value (mean, 34±2) and have significant difference (p < 0.05). The highest number of positive samples were collected from Sindh in month of November, then in June it is circulating in different districts of Pakistan including four Provinces respectively. CONCLUSION: V. cholera detection do not follow a clear seasonal pattern. However, the poor sanitation problems or temperature and rainfall may potentially influence the frequency and duration of cholera across the country. Occurrence of toxigenic V. cholerae in the environment samples showed that cholera is endemic, which is an alarming for a potential future cholera outbreaks in the country.","Zohra, Tanzeel; Ikram, Aamer; Salman, Muhammad; Amir, Afreenish; Saeed, Asim; Ashraf, Zurva; Ahad, Abdul",PLoS One,4,1

However, the usefulness of this marker for predicting acute kidney injury (AKI) progression is unclear. METHODS: This retrospective study was based on the Chang Gung Research Database. Patients admitted to the intensive care unit with a diagnosis of stage 1 or 2 AKI were identified. The primary outcome was a composite of progression to stage 3 AKI, requirement of renal replacement therapy, or 14-day in-hospital mortality. The association between NLR and the primary outcome was examined using a logistic regression model and multivariable analysis. The nonlinearity and cutoff points of this relationship were determined using a restricted cubic spline model. RESULTS: A total of 10,441 patients were enrolled. NLR level at the time of stage 1–2 AKI diagnosis was a marker of adverse outcomes. After adjustment for confounders, NLR was independently associated with the composite outcome of AKI progression, renal replacement therapy, or mortality. The restricted cubic spline model revealed a J-shaped curve, with the lowest odds ratio for an NLR between 7 and 38. Subgroup analysis revealed linear and J-shaped relationships between NLR and the primary outcome in patients admitted to the intensive care unit for medical reasons and for cardiovascular surgery, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: NLR is an independent marker of AKI progression and in-hospital mortality. Because it is readily available in daily practice, it might be used for risk stratification in the AKI population.

Here, we propose a methodology that advances explainable deep learning in the field of glaucoma detection and vertical cup-disc ratio (VCDR), an important risk factor. We trained and evaluated deep learning models using fundus images that underwent a certain cropping policy. We defined the crop radius as a percentage of image size, centered on the optic nerve head (ONH), with an equidistant spaced range from 10–60% (ONH crop policy). The inverse of the cropping mask was also applied (periphery crop policy). Trained models using original images resulted in an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.94 [95% CI 0.92–0.96] for glaucoma detection, and a coefficient of determination (R(2)) equal to 77% [95% CI 0.77–0.79] for VCDR estimation. Models that were trained on images with absence of the ONH are still able to obtain significant performance (0.88 [95% CI 0.85–0.90] AUC for glaucoma detection and 37% [95% CI 0.35–0.40] R(2) score for VCDR estimation in the most extreme setup of 60% ONH crop).

Coinfection with multiple respiratory viruses is common. Although the effects of each virus have been studied individually, the effects of coinfection on disease severity or healthcare seeking are less well-understood. METHODS: A secondary analysis was performed of a maternal influenza vaccine trial conducted between 2011 and 2014 in rural southern Nepal. Prospective weekly active household-based surveillance of infants was conducted from birth to 180 days of age. Mid-nasal swabs were collected and tested for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus, influenza, human metapneumovirus (HMPV), coronavirus, parainfluenza (HPIV), and bocavirus by RT–PCR. Coinfection was defined as the presence of two or more respiratory viruses simultaneously detected as part of the same illness episode. Maternal vaccination status, infant age, prematurity, and number of children under 5 in the household were adjusted for with multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: Of 1,730 infants with a respiratory illness, 327 (19%) had at least two respiratory viruses detected on their primary illness episode. Coinfection status did not differ by maternal vaccination status, infant age, premature birth, and number of children under 5 in the household. Of 113 infants with influenza, 23 (20%) had coinfection. Of 214 infants with RSV, 87 (41%) had coinfection. Overall, infants with coinfection had increased occurrence of fever lasting 4 or more days overall (OR 1.4, 95% CI: 1.1, 2.0), and in the subset of infants with influenza (OR 5.8, 95% CI: 1.8, 18.7). Coinfection was not associated with seeking further care (OR 1.1, 95% CI: 0.8, 1.5) or pneumonia (OR 1.2, 95% CI: 1.0, 1.6). CONCLUSION: A high proportion of infants experiencing their first respiratory illness had multiple viruses detected. Coinfection with influenza was associated with longer duration of fever compared with children with influenza alone, but was not associated with increased illness severity by other measures.

Infection of susceptible SJL mice with this virus serves as an excellent model of virus-induced demyelinating disease, such as multiple sclerosis (MS). iNOS transcripts and protein were detected in brains and spinal cords of TMEV-infected SJL mice during early acute disease, which resembles polioencephalomyelitis. Similar level of expression of iNOS has been found in resistant B6 mice, which develop only early acute disease. Weak iNOS staining was detected in reactive astrocytes and in leptomeningeal infiltrates in TMEV-infected SJL mice at 42 days post infection (p.i.), corresponding to early phase of chronic demyelinating disease, but not at 66 and 180 days p.i. corresponding to advanced and terminal stages of the disease, respectively. Results from other laboratories demonstrated that, blocking of NO by treatment of TMEV-infected SJL mice with amino guanidine (AG), a specific inhibitor of NO resulted in delay of late chronic demyelinating disease. However this protective effect of NO inhibitor depended on the temporal phase of the disease, type of cells expressing iNOS and the time of administration of AG. The results from our laboratory suggests that NO expressed during early acute disease is beneficial to the host through induction of apoptosis of infiltrating T cells and resolution of encephalitis, but its role in myelin/oligodendrocytes damage during late chronic demyelinating disease is not clear and it may depend on availability of superoxide and formation of peroxynitrite.","Oleszak, Emilia L.; Kuzmak, Jacek; Varadhachary, Arun; Katsetos, Christos D.",Experimental Models of Multiple Sclerosis,4,1

The latter two risk factors were prominent modes of transmission during the early stages of HIV/AIDS epidemic and sexual transmission risk remains prominent. In addition, injection drug use is a risk factor to become HIV infected. For HIV, blood transfusion risk was reduced after appropriate testing of blood supplies. Unlike HIV, ZikaV does not produce significant symptoms that require medical attention among four-fifths of infected individuals. Indeed, initially considered a relatively benign virus, the unexpected emergence of ZikaV in the Americas since 2015, and continuing as a virulent and pathological virus for children and adults, created a sense of fear and distress. These emotional responses parallel the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Clinicians, epidemiologists, and other scientists are currently increasingly laboring to discern the full spectrum of risk, relative to vector and population behaviors, and as with HIV, to develop vaccines and chemotherapy against ZikaV. NIH and Walter Reed ZikaV vaccines are on the way.","Jeanene Bengoa, A.; McCoy, Clyde B.; Foley, Brian T.; Puri, Shikha; Mendez, Alejandro J.; Shapshak, Paul",Global Virology II - HIV and NeuroAIDS,4,1

Most of them are zoonoses transmitted from animals and often with insects as vectors. The most dangerous microbes cause a very high mortality, are identified as high-risk agents or “biohazard-level 4” agents and are treated at the highest level of infection protection with strict isolation measures. Dangerous microbes occur as a problem mostly in countries with low hygiene standards/high population density and in tropical-subtropical areas. Infection control must always be based on hygienic measures and strict infection protection.

Richards, MD, Nobel Laureate, said in 1962: “Breathing is that essential physiologic function that is straddled between the conscious & the unconscious and subject to both.” The understanding of the components of this critical physiologic function that starts at birth, and must be continuous and widely adaptable to support all levels of physical, metabolic, and functional needs, has evolved slowly over the millennia by many brilliant scientists from a combination of keen observation, imagination, daring experimentation, trial and error, and necessity, while overcoming dogma, religious inhibitions, and politics.

Propolis is a sticky resinous substance, which is gathered from buds and the bark of trees. It is also known as “bee glue” as bees use it to cover surfaces, seal holes and close gaps in their hives, thus providing a sterile environment that protects them from microbes and spore-producing organisms, including fungi and molds. It can be considered to be a potent chemical weapon against bacteria, viruses, and other pathogenic microorganisms that may invade the bee colony. Also, bees use propolis as an embalming substance, to mummify invaders such as other insects, that have been killed and are too heavy to remove from the colony. Thus, propolis is important for bee health but it also has activity against many human diseases. It is a powerful anti-oxidant and can modulate the activity of reactive oxygen species within the human body. The most studied aspect of propolis is its anti-bacterial activity, which is almost always present at a moderate to high level depending on the exact type of propolis. It is in general more active against Gram positive than Gram negative bacteria, but activity against Gram negative bacteria has been observed. Propolis has been found to be active against a range of viruses and also is almost always active against protozoa such as Tryanosoma brucei and Leishmania donovani. Propolis also shows activity against cardiovascular diseases and diabetes and has immunomodulatory effects. Anti-cancer activity has also been observed. In summary, propolis is remarkable for its range of biological activities and for the variety of its chemical composition. It may be of great importance both to bees and humans.","Siheri, Weam; Alenezi, Sameah; Tusiimire, Jonans; Watson, David G.",Bee Products - Chemical and Biological Properties,4,1

Specifically, people in the view of a monitoring camera are first detected and tracked so that their color and facial features can be extracted and analyzed. Then, recognition of people is carried out using a mapped feature similarity measure and exploiting the temporal correlation and constraints among each sequence of observations. The optimality of recognition is achieved in the sense of maximizing the joint posterior probability of the multiple observations. Experimental results of real and synthetic data are reported to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","Tao, Ji; Tan, Yap-Peng",Intelligent Multimedia Processing with Soft Computing,4,1

Some ocular infections have been eradicated such as smallpox, while others have been controlled by public health measures such as trachoma. The resilience of viruses and the tenacity of bacteria have led to the evolution of old diseases and the emergence of new infections. Continuous search for new antimicrobial agents for the treatment of infectious diseases is, therefore, highly desirable. New infectious agents are discovering the human race, and the ecological changes are exposing mankind to new viruses and bacteria. In addition, air travel and disruption of geographic barriers are leading to new forms of infectious diseases. In the twentieth century, there was a widespread false optimism that infectious diseases are eradicated by antimicrobial agents. It was soon discovered that many infections require new strategies for the treatment of ocular infections. The new antimicrobial agents that have been introduced over the past century can be classified into four major categories including (1) antibiotics that inhibit cell wall synthesis and integrity, (2) antibiotics that inhibit and suppress cell membrane functions, (3) antibiotics that interfere the protein synthesis, and (4) antibiotics that modulate nucleic acid synthesis. The selection of antimicrobial agents for the treatment of ocular infectious diseases is based on the most frequently encountered organisms, the pharmacokinetics of the antibiotics, the dosage required, the ocular penetration, and the cost of therapy. The stumbling blocks to safe and effective antimicrobial therapy in ocular infections include the resistance of the microorganisms, toxicity of the drug, and poor ocular penetration of antimicrobial agents.","Tabbara, Khalid F.",Ocular Infections,4,1

The higher prevalence of comorbid disease puts this population at higher risk for worse short- and long-term outcomes following ICU admission compared to the general population, although short-term mortality seems to be determined largely by the acute illness severity rather than CKD status per se. The pathophysiologic changes accompanying CKD present unique challenges to the management of acute critical illness most notably volume and metabolic homeostasis and drug dosing adjustment. CKD is an important risk factor for the development of acute kidney injury (AKI) complicating critical illness and can predispose to further accelerated decline in kidney function among ICU survivors. Renal replacement therapy (RRT) support is frequently used in ICU settings, and continuous renal replacement therapy modality remains the most commonly used among critically ill patients.","Fidalgo, Pedro; Bagshaw, Sean M.",Management of Chronic Kidney Disease,4,1

Developments in housing have been phenomenal – from the calf hutch to environmentally controlled nurseries for calves. Heifer housing has ranged from relatively simple, but labor-efficient housing, to complete confinement systems.

To this end, we take disruptive innovation theory as our point of departure to scrutinize cryptocurrencies as an instance of socio-technical change. We employ Causal Layered Analysis to develop our four-layer analytical framework to conceptually examine the changes pertained by the diffusion of cryptocurrencies. We provide examples of changes company-level, industry-level as well as societal changes where cryptocurrencies have played a central role. On a company level, cryptocurrencies provide a cost-efficient means for cross-border money transfer and thus pose a significant threat to the existing intermediary-based business models. On an industry level, many central banks are experimenting with crypto- or digital currencies. On a societal level, cryptocurrencies play an important role in particularly when the traditional institutions and societal structures collapse. For example, in Venezuela’s recent political and economic crisis, cryptocurrencies contributed to the development of a parallel financial system when the bolivar practically lost its value.

Each of these disciplines works in systems that face ethical dilemmas, making it important that public health workers have motivation to understand and practice within the ethical guidelines of their profession, thus making ethics an important component of training and practice. The dangers of ethical lapses are overwhelmingly apparent in the case of the Eugenics movement of the early 20(th) century which metamorphosed from forced sterilizations in many liberal democratic countries into mass murder of physically and mentally handicapped children and adults in Nazi Germany. Between 1939 and 1941, 180 thousand psychiatric patients along with an equivalent number of handicapped children and adults were killed in an organized extermination program in Germany by lethal gassing. This method was then applied to the industrialized murder or Holocaust of six million Jews and millions of other “untermenschen” (sub human) in the greatest genocide in human history. Shortly after World War II ended the Nuremberg Trials of Nazi war criminals were conducted including medical doctors, and some were executed for crimes against humanity. This was followed by the 1948 United Nations Declaration on Human Rights and by the World Medical Association’s Helsinki Declaration. Both are widely accepted as cornerstone documents—the latter specifically governing ethical standards related to human experimentation—and are revised regularly since being issued in 1964. But genocide has not disappeared, nor has unscrupulous experimentation such as the Tuskegee experiment on black Americans infected with syphilis and left untreated even after the availability of a cure, penicillin. Ethical standards are now required by “Helsinki Committees”—ethical review boards—in most medical facilities worldwide. Ethical frameworks have evolved in part due to bitter experience of ethical failures later recognized and affecting public health standards of practice. Future generations of public health leaders and staff will face many ethical issues such as mandatory immunization of health workers and school children, and assisted death of terminally ill patients.","Tulchinsky, Theodore H.",Case Studies in Public Health,4,33

Initially, a time‐ and dose‐dependent study was carried out to find the optimal stimulation conditions for the TNF‐α response. The TNF‐α response peaked between 3 and 4 h at 38.5 °C. A dose in the range of 5–10 g of E. coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS)/ml whole blood was found to give the maximum TNF‐α response. Thirty‐eight Danish–Holstein dairy cows were investigated for their TNF‐α responsiveness ex vivo in the periparturient period.

Moreover, the mean TNF‐α responsiveness of 38 cows was found to be significantly increased (P < 0.001) in the weeks close to calving. However, in the more stabile physiological periods, some cows had a consistently low TNF‐α response, whereas others had high a TNF‐α response. We are currently investigating whether high and low TNF‐α responders to E. coli LPS also exist in dairy cows in vivo.

Such relations, if accurate and consistent, may be leveraged to make more effective use of the commercial affect-detection software. For this study, we collected affect data over four days from a classroom study with 65 students using Betty’s Brain. Basic emotions obtained from commercial software were aligned to achievement emotions obtained using sensor-free models. Interpretable classifiers enabled the study of relationships between the two types of emotions. Our findings show that certain basic emotions can help infer complex achievement emotions such as confusion, frustration and engaged concentration. This suggests the possibility of using commercial software as a less context-sensitive and more development-friendly alternative to the affect detector models currently used in learning environments.","Munshi, Anabil; Mishra, Shitanshu; Zhang, Ningyu; Paquette, Luc; Ocumpaugh, Jaclyn; Baker, Ryan; Biswas, Gautam",Artificial Intelligence in Education,4,11

A simple survey of how individual workers in urban ecology have been coping with COVID-19 constraints found divergent responses to COVID-19 on people’s activities, both within countries and between continents. Many academics felt frustrated at being unable to do fieldwork, but several saw opportunities to change ways of working and review their engagement with the natural world. Some engaging with social groups found new ways of sharing ideas and developing aspirations without face-to-face contact. Practitioners creating and managing urban greenspaces had to devise ways to work and travel while maintaining social distancing. Many feared severe funding impacts from changed local government priorities. Around the world, the COVID-19 pandemic has amplified issues, such as environmental injustice, disaster preparation and food security, that have been endemic in most countries across the global south in modern times.

Patients with severe hepatitis have impaired immunity and are therefore vulnerable to all kinds of infections. After infection, these patients may experience shock, DIC and multiple organ failure, all of which seriously affect their prognosis and are major causes of death. Concurrent infections consist primarily of infections of the lungs, intestines, biliary tract, and urinary tract, as well as spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and sepsis. 2. Severe hepatitis may reduce the synthesis of coagulation factors and enhance their dysfunction and increase anticoagulants and platelet abnormalities, leading to coagulopathy. Infection, hepatorenal syndrome and complications can further aggravate coagulopathy, resulting in DIC and seriously affecting patient prognosis. 3. Hepatorenal syndrome, which is characterized by renal failure, hemodynamic changes in arterial circulation and abnormalities in the endogenous vascular system, is a common clinical complication of end-stage liver disease, and one of the important indicators for the prognosis of patients with severe hepatitis. 4. Water electrolyte disorder (water retention, hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hyperkalaemia) and acid-base imbalance are common in patients with severe hepatitis. These internal environment disorders can lead to exacerbation and complication of the illness. 5. Hepatic encephalopathy is a neurological and psychiatric anomaly syndrome based on metabolic disorder, and an important prognostic indicator for patients with severe hepatitis. 6. The hepatopulmonary syndrome is an important vascular complication in lungs due to systemic hypoxemia in patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension. The majority of patients with HPS are asymptomatic. Long-term oxygen therapy remains the most frequently recommended therapy for symptoms in patients with severe hypoxemia. 7. Endotoxemia, an important complication of severe hepatitis, is not only a second hit to the liver, but also leads to other complications including SIRS and MODS.","Song, Jian-Xin; Zhu, Lin; Zhu, Chuan-Long; Hu, Jin-Hua; Sun, Zi-Jian; Xu, Xiang; Xin, Min-You; Zhang, Qiong-Fang; Zhang, Da-Zhi; Shang, Jia; Huang, Jia-Quan; Xu, Dong",Acute Exacerbation of Chronic Hepatitis B,4,8

One particular way of doing such transformations is to create cross-functional software development units. This represents new challenges for control for organizations as the unformal agile control mechanisms from the software units meet the more formal, bureaucratic and hierarchical control from other units. The research on how to manage control in agile transformations, however, is scarce. Through a case study of a new, cross-functional unit in a financial institution, we report on their work to implement control in agile transformations. To analyze our results, we draw on new perspectives for control in the digital era, which challenges existing presumptions on control. Our findings indicate how agile transformations require rethinking traditional control mechanisms and experiment with new control perspectives more suitable for the digital era.","Mikalsen, Marius; Stray, Viktoria; Moe, Nils Brede; Backer, Idun",Agile Processes in Software Engineering and Extreme Programming - Workshops,4,17

This study aims to compare the effect of combining nebulized amikacin with intravenous amikacin to the effect of the usual intravenous route alone in the treatment of patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia and its impact on the duration of mechanical ventilation, laboratory, and clinical picture of the patients. RESULTS: This study was carried out on 64 mechanically ventilated patients with Gram-negative VAP. The patients were divided into 2 groups. Group A included 32 patients treated with nebulized amikacin plus IV amikacin, and group B included 32 patients treated with IV amikacin alone. The duration of treatment for both groups was 8 days with a daily assessment of Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score (CPIS) and monitoring of clinical and laboratory parameters. Sputum cultures were obtained thereafter. In our study, the CPIS score and overall ICU mortality were less in the nebulized than in the IV group but the difference failed to be statistically significant. Increase of oxygenation level (Pao2/Fio2 ratio), organism clearance, decrease in serum creatinine level, duration of mechanical ventilation, and length of ICU stay were significantly different in favor of group A than group B. CONCLUSION: Nebulized and IV amikacin offered better oxygenation, organism clearance, less nephrotoxicity, and less duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU stay than the IV group. Combined and IV routes were comparable regarding the decrease in CPIS score and ICU mortality with no significant difference between them. However, we prefer to use the combined regimen for the mentioned reasons. Further large-scale studies are required to confirm these findings and to establish a definite conclusion.","El Fawy, Dalia M.; Ibrahim, Azza Yousef; Abdulmageed, Ahmed Mostafa Mohamed; El Seddek, Eman Abo Bakr",Ain-Shams J Anesthesiol,4,28

The aim of the study is to evaluate the knowledge and attitudes of medical students towards current outbreak. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted between 20 February - 4 March 2020 via an online survey with 285 students from one faculty of medicine in Turkey. Ethical approval was obtained from Bahcesehir University Clinical Research Ethics Committee. RESULTS: Among participants, 59% were female and 70% were Turkish citizen. Mostly, students were getting updates from media (70%) and the following source was WHO (18%). Of all participants, 60% correctly stated that SARS-CoV-2 has lower mortality rate than SARS and MERS. The most used protections were hand-sanitizers, avoiding close contacts with Asians and using masks in crowded areas (respectively 67%, 30%, 29%). On the scale 1 to 10 (1: strongly trust, 10: strongly do not trust); median for WHO's information process was 7, WHO's outbreak management was 6, Turkish Ministry of Health's (TMH) information process was 5 and TMH's outbreak management was 5. Turkish students significantly had lower trust for all of the matters (Mann-Whitney U = 7157.0, p = 0.040; Mann-Whitney U = 6405.5, p = 0.001; Mann-Whitney U = 5313.0, p < 0.001; Mann-Whitney U = 4679.5, p= p < 0.001). Of the participants, 19% said they would not get vaccinated if there was a vaccine. Most common reasons were not feeling at risk and not trusting new vaccines. CONCLUSIONS: There is a lack of the knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 among students, and for that reason a scientific conference about SARS-CoV-2 took place at the faculty in 6th March as an intervention. Especially Turkish students had lower trust for information process and outbreak management of WHO and TMH. One out of five students was not considering to get vaccinated if there was a vaccine for COVID-19.

The current study examined how living alone was related to social contact and emotional well-being among older adults during the pandemic. Adults (N = 226) aged 69+ completed a brief survey assessing their living situation, social contact with different social partners (in person, by phone, electronically), and emotions during the morning, afternoon and evening the prior day. Older adults who live alone were less likely to see others in person or to receive or provide help, and reported less positive emotion the prior day than those who lived with others. Living alone was associated with more positive emotions concurrent with in-person contact. In contrast, phone contact was related to higher levels of negate affect among those living alone, but not among those who live with others. Findings suggest older adults who live alone may be more reactive to social contact during the COVID 19 outbreak than older adults who reside with others. In-person contact appears to confer distinct benefits not available via telephone contact, suggesting that possible interventions during the pandemic may work best with safe forms of in-person contact.","Ng, Yee To; Fingerman, Karen; Zhang, Shiyang; Britt, Katherine; Colera, Gianna; Birditt, Kira; Charles, Susan",Innov Aging,4,24

In response, an unprecedented number of do‐it‐yourself hobbyists (i.e. makers) have started to use digital fabrication tools to produce critical items. These bottom‐up communities are mobilising as part of a global movement to produce innovative solutions to much‐needed items, such as face masks, face shields and ventilators. As these individuals tackle widespread resource constraints, the conceptual lens of frugal innovation becomes highly relevant to study how these solutions developed. Frugal innovation is a type of resource‐constrained innovation that refers to the practice of doing more with less, for more people. In this study, we present two instrumental case studies of maker projects that use digital fabrication to tackle COVID‐19. The first case study is from Italy (a High Income Country) and the second is from India (a Lower Middle Income Country). We analyse the frugality of these cases and highlight their similar approaches. In doing so, we suggest that current theories of frugal innovation can be expanded to new geographical and technological contexts. We put forward that frugal innovation is an important strategy in crisis response beyond emerging markets and that digital fabrication can be considered as an important frugal innovation enabler, both in its ability to produce frugal solutions and to support distributed networks of innovation actors. This study advances knowledge on how frugal innovation unfolds in the Maker movement. It is among one of the first studies to connect the domains of makers and frugal innovation, and the paper concludes by identifying several promising areas for further research.","Corsini, Lucia; Dammicco, Valeria; Moultrie, James",,4,21

This strategy is now implemented widely and protected more than 19 million children in 2018. It was previously reported that exposure to SMC reduced antibody levels to AMA1, MSP-1(42) and CSP, but the duration of exposure to SMC up to three 3 years, had no effect on antibody levels to MSP-1(42) and CSP. METHODS: In 2017, a cross-sectional survey was carried out 1 month after the last dose of SMC had been given to children aged 4–5 years randomly selected from areas where SMC had been given for 2 or 4 years during the malaria transmission season. A total of 461 children were enrolled, 242 children in areas where SMC had been implemented for 4 years and 219 children in areas where SMC had been implemented for 2 years. Antibody extracted from dry blood spots was used to measure IgG levels to the malaria antigens CSP, MSP-1(42) and AMA1 by ELISA. RESULTS: The prevalence of antibodies to MSP-1(42) was similar in children who had received SMC for 4 years compared to those who had received SMC for only 2 years (85.1 vs 86.0%, ajusted odd ratio (aOR) = 1.06, 95% confidence intervals (CI 0.62–1.80), p = 0.80). The prevalence of antibodies to AMA-1 and to CSP was not lower in children who received SMC for 4 years compared to those who had received SMC for only 2 years (95.3 vs 88.8%, aOR = 3.16, 95% CI 1.44–6.95, p = 0.004 for AMA-1; and 91.2 vs 81.9%, aOR = 3.14, 95% CI 1.70–5.76, p < 0.001 for CSP). Median antibody levels for anti-MSP-1(42) IgG were not significatively inferior in children who had received SMC for four rather than 2 years (0.88 (IQR: 0.64–1.15) and 0.95 ((0.68–1.15), respectively), anti-CSP (1.30 (1.00–1.56) and 1.17 (0.87–1.47)), and anti-AMA-1 (1.45 (1.24–1.68) and 1.41 (1.17–1.64)). CONCLUSION: In an area of high seasonal malaria transmission, children who had received SMC for 4 years did not had lower seropositivity or antibody levels to AMA1, MSP-1(42) and CSP compared to children who had received SMC for only 2 years suggesting that children who have received SMC for 4 years may not be more at risk of malaria after the cessation of SMC than children who have received SMC for a shorter period.","Mahamar, Almahamoudou; Issiaka, Djibrilla; Youssouf, Ahamadou; Niambele, Sidi M.; Soumare, Harouna M.; Attaher, Oumar; Barry, Amadou; Narum, David L.; Duffy, Patrick E.; Greenwood, Brian; Fried, Michal; Dicko, Alassane",Malar J,4,22

ICP is often familial and overlaps with other cholestatic disorders. Treatment options for ICP are not well established, although there are limited data to support the use of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) to relieve pruritus, the main symptom. Rifampicin, a widely used antibiotic including in pregnant women, is effective in reducing pruritus in non-pregnancy cholestasis and has been used as a supplement to UDCA in severe ICP. Many women with ICP are electively delivered preterm, although there are no randomised data to support this approach. METHODS: We have initiated an international multicentre randomised clinical trial to compare the clinical efficacy of rifampicin tablets (300 mg bd) with that of UDCA tablets (up to 2000 mg daily) in reducing pruritus in women with ICP, using visual pruritus scores as a measuring tool. DISCUSSION: Our study will be the first to examine the outcomes of treatment specifically in the severe early onset form of ICP, comparing “standard” UDCA therapy with rifampicin, and so be able to provide for the first-time high-quality evidence for use of rifampicin in severe ICP. It will also allow an assessment of feasibility of a future trial to test whether elective early delivery in severe ICP is beneficial.

This tension between the separation that is required for safety and the human need for contact is especially felt by institutions of higher education. Many such institutions not only educate students but seek to foster the kinds of communities which have thrived on personal interaction and shared physical space. Different institutions have responded to COVID-19 and its impacts on their members differently. Given that the spring semester will begin months before COVID-19 vaccines are widely available, we offer seven recommendations and argue that for a university, college, or other similarly situated educational institution to ethically respond to the pandemic, it must follow these recommendations. These recommendations are grounded in both scientific research and ethical analysis. Proper ethical analysis, which is necessary for the implementation of good policies, cannot be accomplished without an evidence-based grounding. After describing features of the virus and the situation that faces higher education institutions, in general, we turn to a detailed discussion of transmission. We discuss interventions available to institutions, including masking, hygiene, barriers, and testing and surveillance. Our recommendations are supported by an ethical analysis reliant on four themes: expertise, planning, stewardship, and dignity.","Pilkington, Bryan C.; Wilkins, Victoria; Nichols, Daniel Brian",International Journal of Ethics Education,4,1

This retrospective study included preterm neonates admitted to NICU with clinical and/or laboratory diagnosis of sepsis. Blood culture was done followed by antimicrobial susceptibility testing for positive cases. Neonates with sepsis were classified into early onset sepsis (EOS) and late onset sepsis (LOS). Hematological scoring system (HSS) for detection of sepsis was calculated. RESULTS: The study included 153 cases of neonatal sepsis; 63 (41.2%) EOS and 90 (58.8%) LOS. The majority of the neonates had very low or moderately low birth weight (90.9%). All neonates received first-line antibiotics in the form of ampicillin-sulbactam, and gentamicin. Second-line antibiotics were administered to 133 neonates (86.9%) as vancomycin and imipenem-cilastatin. Mortalities were more common among EOS group (p < 0.017). Positive blood cultures were detected in 61 neonates (39.8%) with a total number of 66 cultures. The most commonly encountered organisms were Klebsiella MDR and CoNS (31.8% each). Klebsiella MDR was the most predominant organism in EOS (28.9%), while CoNS was the most predominant in LOS (39.2%) The detected organisms were divided into 3 families; Enterobacteriaceae, non-fermenters, and Gram-positive family. There 3 families were 100% resistant to ampicillin. The highest sensitivity in Enterobacteriaceae and Non-fermenters was for colistin and polymyxin-B. An HSS of 3–8 had a sensitivity and specificity of 62.3% and 57.6%, respectively for diagnosis of culture-proven sepsis. CONCLUSION: Neonatal sepsis was encountered in 21.5% of admitted preterm neonates; LOS was more common (58.8%). Mortality was 51.6%. Klebsiella MDR and CoNS were the most commonly encountered organisms in both EOS and LOS. The isolated families were 100% resistant to ampicillin. The hematological scoring system (HSS) showed limited sensitivity for detection of sepsis.","Salama, Khaled; Gad, Amira; El Tatawy, Sarah",Egypt Pediatric Association Gaz,4,1

During COVID-19, a sizeable proportion of General Surgical procedures were performed at a local “cold” site private hospital. This study aims to determine the direct impact of COVID-19 on the standard of operation-note documentation at a non-routine site compared to our routine site. METHOD: The Royal College of Surgeons Good Surgical Practice guidance highlights 19 key-variables to record within operation-notes. 300 consecutive operations were identified between May and August 2020 and details of electronic operation-notes collected. Throughout this study period, educational emails and posters were introduced at both sites secondary to ongoing audit. RESULTS: 228/300 (76%) operations took place at our main hospital. The remainder were commissioned to the other. Operating surgeons and anaesthetists were similar at both sites. Quality of documentation was poorer for many key variables at the cold site when compared with the main site (operating-surgeons (22% vs 91%), urgency of operation (62% vs 99%), antibiotic prophylaxis (72% vs 99%) and DVT prophylaxis (21% vs 98%)). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 has resulted in many unintended consequences including a reduction in the quality of operation-notes. Moving forward, this may be reduced by improving information technology resources and increasing awareness and education.","Camilleri-Brennan, J; Lim, M",Br J Surg,4,1

Until now, CMM has been implemented and researched very little in Germany. Against this background, this article depicts the instrument of CMM theoretically and presents a related practical project in which various measures were implemented with the aim of changing mobility behaviour and attitudes. The evaluation of this project allows the conclusion to be drawn that CMM correlates with changes in the attitudes of employees. However, a direct change in actual traffic behaviour could not be proven. The study is based on the statistical analysis of two surveys conducted in 2019 and 2020. The presentation of the results rounds off with policy implications.

The complete neuroimaging spectrum and histopathological characteristics of this entity are yet to be elucidated. In an endemic region, diffuse leptomeningeal enhancement on neuroimaging with associated communicating hydrocephalus is usually suggestive of infective meningitis and the patients are started on empirical anti-microbial therapy. However, it is important to consider other differential diagnosis of leptomeningeal enhancement in such cases, particularly if the clinical condition does not improve on anti-microbial therapy. An early diagnosis of a neoplastic etiology may be of particular importance as the treatment regimens vary considerably depending on the underlying disease condition. CASE PRESENTATION: In this case report, we describe a case of DLGNT with high-grade histopathological features which was initially managed as tubercular meningitis based on the initial neuroimaging findings. Due to worsening of the clinical course and subsequent imaging findings at follow-up, a diagnosis of DLGNT was considered and subsequently proven to be DLGNT with features of anaplasia on histopathological examination of leptomeningeal biopsy specimen. CONCLUSION: This case highlights the importance of recognizing certain subtle finding on MRI which may help in an early diagnosis of DLGNT which is crucial for appropriate treatment.","Peer, Sameer; Murumkar, Vivek; Kulanthaivelu, Karthik; Prasad, Chandrajit; Rao, Shilpa; Santosh, Vani",Egypt J Radiol Nucl Med,4,1

This special communication highlights the value of peer mentoring by describing a case study of an early career IS peer mentoring group. We delineate our curriculum and structure; support and processes; and products and outcomes. We highlight important group member characteristics to consider during group formation and continuation. The group’s long-term (6 years) success was attributed to the balance of similarities and differences among group members. Members were in a similar career phase and used similar methodologies but studied different health topics at different institutions. Group members gave and received instrumental and psychosocial support and shared resources and knowledge. Peer mentoring can serve an important function to provide emotional, logistical, and professional development support for early career scholars. Our case study highlights strategies to foster peer mentoring groups that provide a generalizable blueprint and opportunity for improved outcomes for early career professionals.","Dickson, Kelsey S.; Glass, Joseph E.; Barnett, Miya L.; Graham, Andrea K.; Powell, Byron J.; Stadnick, Nicole A.",,4,16

The present study examines the prevalence of loneliness and positive mental health indicators (mental well-being and self-esteem) in four Nordic countries and associations between loneliness, mental well-being, and high self-esteem. This study is based on data from the Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) study which was conducted in 2018 in Denmark, Finland, Iceland, and Sweden. Participants were 5883 15-year-old boys and girls. To examine the associations between loneliness, mental well-being, and self-esteem, structural equation modeling (SEM) was applied. In the comparison of Nordic countries, the prevalence of loneliness was highest among Finnish and Icelandic adolescents. High mental well-being and high self-esteem were most prevalent in Denmark and Sweden. In general, boys scored higher on positive mental health indicators and girls on loneliness. Loneliness was also a strong indicator of low mental well-being and low self-esteem in all Nordic countries. Loneliness is not only associated with mental health problems such as anxiety and depression, but it is also a risk factor for adolescents’ positive mental health. Positive mental health is important for healthy maturation and there is a need to develop initiatives to reduce adolescent loneliness and so support positive development.","Lyyra, Nelli; Thorsteinsson, Einar Baldvin; Eriksson, Charli; Madsen, Katrine Rich; Tolvanen, Asko; Löfstedt, Petra; Välimaa, Raili",Int J Environ Res Public Health,4,1

Several studies emphasize the need for multi-stakeholder collaboration to enable sustainable business model innovation, but few studies offer guidance to companies for engaging in such a collaborative process. Based on the concept of boundary work, this study presents a tested process tool that helps companies engage with multiple stakeholders to innovate sustainable business models. The tool was developed in three iterative phases, including testing and evaluation with 74 participants in six sustainable business model innovation cases. The final process tool consists of five steps to facilitate multi-stakeholder alignment for sustainable business model innovation: (1) defining a collective ambition, (2) mapping and negotiating the changing organizational boundaries, (3) exploring opportunities and tensions for aligning stakeholders, (4) defining first interventions and (5) developing a collaboration pitch. We found that the tool enables discussions and negotiations on sensitive topics, such as power reconfigurations and mutual responsibilities to help stakeholders align. For companies, the boundary tool enriches sustainable business model innovation by offering guidance in the process of redesigning their multi-stakeholder system, assessing their own organizational boundaries, exploring, negotiating and prioritizing strategic actions based on organizational boundary changes and kick-starting new partnerships.","Velter, M.

However, unawareness and negligence about the severity, mode of transmission and preventive measures about the disease can further predispose the nursing fraternity to a higher risk of infection. To overcome these lacunae in knowledge, a training program named Project PRAKASH was initiated for in-service nurses across the country. The objective of the program was to impart up-to-date knowledge to the nursing professionals in the management of viral hepatitis and to assess the effectiveness of the training program through pre-post-knowledge assessment survey. METHODOLOGY: One-day training program titled 'Hepatitis Induction Program' was conducted for a period of 2 years (2018-2020) among nursing professionals. It was accompanied by administration of 54-item knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) questionnaire with four sections: demographic details, knowledge (30 items), attitude (11 items) and practice (13 items), followed by post-knowledge assessment.

METHODS To evaluate the effect of PM014 on the lung inflammation induced by fine dust, this study investigated inflammatory responses in the lung upon pm10 exposure by examining the infiltration of inflammatory cell profiles from bronchial alveolar lavage fluid (BALF), lung histology, and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines measured by RT-PCR and ELISA. RESULTS PM014-treated mice exhibited reduced lung tissue damage and inflammatory cell infiltration. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) analysis showed significant decrease in the population of total cells, macrophages, eosinophils, and neutrophils in PM014-treated mice. PM014 treatment downregulated the pro-inflammatory cytokine expressions including IL-1b, IL-8, IL-6, TNF-alpha, IL-21 and IL-17. ELISA analysis also showed reduced production of IL-1b, IL-6 and IL-17 in PM014-treated mice. CONCLUSION PM014 suppressed the pm10-induced inflammatory response in mice. This study shows that PM014 is a possible therapeutic agent for lung inflammation induced by fine dust.","Lee, Ye-Seul; Min, Daeun; Park, Seon-Young; Lee, Junyoung; Bae, Hyunsu",BMC complementary medicine and therapies,4,33

We aimed to document mucosal healing and to explore the risk of colorectal neoplasia with vedolizumab maintenance therapy. Methods Surveillance colonoscopy was prospectively scheduled for patients with longstanding ulcerative coltis [UC] or CD at a tertiary referral centre, in the open-label extension phase (vedolizumab 300 mg intravenously [IV] every 4 weeks) of the Gemini studies [GEMINI LTS, study number NCT00790933]. Mayo score ≤ 1 or ulcer disappearance [in CD] was defined as mucosal healing. Targeted biopsies were graded for inflammation and dysplasia. Results Of 68 patients [29 CD/39 UC] treated for ≥ 1 year [median 3.2 years, range 1.1-6.1], 58 [24 CD/34 UC] were endoscopically monitored. Durable endoscopic healing corrected by non-responder imputation was found in 7/24, 29% [CD] and 17/34, 50% [UC]. Combined histological and mucosal healing was observed in 5/24 [CD] and 11/34 [UC] of those with endoscopic healing. Low-grade dysplasia was detected in 10% of patients and high-grade dysplasia in the resection specimen of one patient with biopsy-proven low-grade dysplasia. Conclusions Long-term endoscopic and histological healing was observed in a proportion of patients treated with vedolizumab long-term. The dysplasia risk with vedolizumab deserves further study.","Noman, Maja; Ferrante, Marc; Bisschops, Raf; De Hertogh, Gert; Van den Broeck, Karolien; Rans, Karen; Rutgeerts, Paul; Vermeire, Séverine; Van Assche, Gert",Journal of Crohn's & colitis,4,29

To understand the impact of autophagy modulation on a rainbow trout gill cell line, RTgill-W1, treatments including reduced nutrition (2% fetal bovine serum compared with 10% control), rapamycin, 3-methyladenine, deoxynivalenol, and chloroquine were tested. Western blot and immunofluorescence were used to detect microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain protein and quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to detect the expression of 10 autophagy-related genes. At 3-d post-treatment, reduced nutrition significantly (p < 0.05) increased autophagy while deoxynivalenol significantly (p < 0.01) suppressed it compared to controls. These phenomena were confirmed by using immunofluorescence to detect the number of autophagosomes in RTgill-W1. Chloroquine is critical to allow observation of microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain protein in this model. The commonly used autophagy-modulating chemicals rapamycin and 3-methyladenine either activated or suppressed microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain protein, respectively, as expected from the literature, but did not act in a consistently significant manner. Expression of five of the 10 Atg genes, including lc3, gabarap, atg4, atg7, and atg12, were altered in a similar pattern to microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain protein. The consistent trend of autophagy-related gene upregulation including becn1, lc3, gabarap, and atg9 following treatment with 3-methyladenine and chloroquine is suggestive of a novel feedback regulation in the autophagy machinery.","Liu, Juan-Ting; Balmori-Cedeno, Jaramar; Misk, Ehab; Lumsden, John S",In vitro cellular & developmental biology.

Maintaining blood supply during the COVID-19 pandemic is a huge challenge. We conducted a cross-sectional study by an online survey to analyse the variation of practices across blood centers of India during this pandemic. A total of 196 blood centers completely responded to the online survey. Most of the blood centres who responded were part of Government hospitals (60 %), part of an academic institutes (55.6 %) and were directly supporting a COVID hospital (67.5 %). Almost 95.4 % blood centers reported reduction of blood donation mainly due to lockdown (50 %) and inability to conduct camps (17.3 %). Scheduling blood donations was one of the most difficult to implement strategy for maintaining adequate blood donation (40.2 %). Blood center manpower management was also a challenge and upto 48 % blood centers operated in two batches to ensure social distancing in blood banks and reduce the risk of exposure. Hemato-oncology (36.8 %) and obstetrics (33.7 %) were major utilizer of blood during the pandemic. There were marked variations in use of PPE by blood banks staff as well as strategies adopted while conducting immunohematology tests on COVID-19 positive patients samples. This pandemic has highlighted some of the major limitations of the health services but blood services have risen to the challenge and strived to maintain the blood supply chain while ensuring blood donor and staff safety.

We describe the technique and report the outcomes of robotic bladder diverticulectomy at our institution. METHODS A chart review of patients who underwent robotic bladder diverticulectomy at our institution from 2007 to 2010 was carried out. Indications for the procedure were: lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) not responding to medical treatment (2 patients), ureteral obstruction (1 patient), tumor arising in a diverticulum (2 patients) and diverticulum secondary to neurogenic bladder (1 patient). One patient also had renal dysfunction associated with ureteral insertion into the diverticulum and therefore underwent ipsilateral ureteroneocystostomy. Other additional procedures included transurethral resection of the prostate (1 patient) and bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection (1 patient). Perioperative and postoperative outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS Six patients (median age 61.5 years, range 19-75) underwent da Vinci diverticulectomy using a transperitoneal approach without the need for open conversion. Median operative time was 232 min (135-360 min.). Median estimated blood loss was 100 mL (50-150 mL). The Foley catheter was removed after a negative cystogram and median time to catheter removal was 7 days (7-12 days). Median hospital stay was 3 days (2-5 days). The only complication was a urinary tract infection managed with antibiotics.

Several adjunctive infection prevention methods are in common use but their effectiveness in reducing healthcare-associated respiratory viral infections is unclear. In this review, recent advances regarding the effectiveness of several adjunctive infection prevention methods to reduce healthcare-associated respiratory viral infections are discussed. RECENT FINDINGS Training and education on hand hygiene guidelines, mandatory influenza vaccination for healthcare personnel, access to paid sick leave to reduce ill presenteeism, cohorting of patients with the same infection or clinical syndrome, neuraminidase inhibitor chemoprophylaxis during influenza outbreaks, and enhanced visitor restrictions in pediatric hospitals all have shown some degree of effectiveness in observational or quasi-experimental studies. SUMMARY Most of the studies evaluating the effect of adjunctive infection prevention methods on healthcare-associated respiratory viral infections are observational or quasi-experimental and are often combined with other interventions. Therefore, it is difficult to determine the precise effectiveness or efficacy of these interventions and more controlled trials are needed. Multimodal infection prevention policies are likely to be most effective in reducing healthcare-associated respiratory viral infections.","Most, Zachary M",Current opinion in infectious diseases,4,1

Research focused on high-intensity upper extremity activity-based therapy for persons with spinal cord injury (SCI) is limited. OBJECTIVE To summarize high-intensity activity-based interventions used in neurological disorders for their current or potential application to SCI. METHODS The scoping review included articles from MEDLINE, CINAHL, Cochrane CENTRAL, and OTseeker with the criteria: non-invasive activity-based interventions delivered atleast three times/week for two weeks, upper extremity functional outcomes, 13 years or older, English language, and neurological disorders three months post onset/injury. RESULTS The search yielded 172 studies. There were seven studies with SCI, all in adults. Activity-based interventions in SCI included task-specific training and gaming, with and without electrical stimulation, and a robotic exoskeleton. The other populations found in the review included studies in stroke, cerebral palsy, and multiple sclerosis. Thirty-four different interventions were reported in other populations. In comparison to the extensive stroke research, work in SCI was not found for high-intensity interventions using virtual reality, brain stimulation, rehabilitation devices, and applications to the home and telerehab settings.

DATA SOURCES Electronic databases (MEDLINE, Scopus, ClinicalTrials.gov, PROSPERO, EMBASE, Scielo and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) were searched for studies published before October 2018. Keywords included ""gestational diabetes,"" ""preterm birth,"" ""pregnancy,"" and ""17-hydroxyprogesterone caproate."" METHODS OF STUDY SELECTION Studies comparing 17α-hydroxyprogesterone caproate with unexposed control groups in women with singleton gestation and a history of a prior spontaneous preterm birth were included. The primary outcome was the development of GDM. Secondary outcomes included abnormal 1-hour, 50-g glucose screen results and mean venous blood glucose levels. Summary estimates were reported as mean differences and 95% CI for continuous variables or relative risk (RR) with 95% CI for dichotomous outcomes. Meta-analysis was performed using the random effects model of DerSimonian and Laird. TABULATION, INTEGRATION AND RESULTS Six studies, four of which were cohort studies, met inclusion criteria and were included in the final meta-analysis. Of the 5,053 women, 1,538 (30.4%) received 17α-hydroxyprogesterone caproate and 3,515 (69.6%) were in unexposed control groups. The overall rate of GDM in women exposed to 17α-hydroxyprogesterone caproate was 10.9% vs 6.1% in women who were not exposed (RR 1.77, 95% CI 1.22-2.55). After exclusion of the cohort studies, the summary estimate of effect was nonsignificant among women who had been randomly allocated to 17α-hydroxyprogesterone caproate (RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.63-2.36). CONCLUSION Women with singleton gestations receiving weekly 17α-hydroxyprogesterone caproate for recurrent preterm birth prevention had a significantly higher incidence of abnormal glucose test results and GDM compared with those in unexposed control groups, a finding that did not hold among women who had been randomly allocated to 17α-hydroxyprogesterone caproate.

We compared four indirect immunofluorescent antibody tests (IFAT), one enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (FCoV Immunocomb; Biogal) and three rapid immunochromatographic (RIM) tests against a panel of samples designated by consensus as positive or negative. Specificity was 100% for all but the two IFATs based on transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), at 83.3% and 97.5%. The IFAT and ELISA tests were best for obtaining an antibody titre and for working in the presence of virus. The RIM tests were the best for obtaining a result quickly (10-15 mins); of these, the Speed F-Corona was the most sensitive, at 92.4%, followed by FASTest feline infectious peritonitis (FIP; 84.6%) and Anigen Rapid FCoV antibody test (64.1%). Sensitivity was 100% for the ELISA, one FCoV IFAT and one TGEV IFAT; and 98.2% for a second TGEV IFA and 96.1% for a second FCoV IFAT. All tests worked with effusions, even when only blood products were stipulated in the instruction manual. The ELISA and Anigen RIM tests were best for small quantities of sample. The most appropriate FCoV antibody test to use depends on the reason for testing: in excluding a diagnosis of FIP, sensitivity, specificity, small sample quantity, rapidity and ability to work in the presence of virus all matter. For FCoV screening, speed and sensitivity are important, and for FCoV elimination antibody titre is essential.","Addie, Diane D; le Poder, Sophie; Burr, Paul; Decaro, Nicola; Graham, Elizabeth; Hofmann-Lehmann, Regina; Jarrett, Oswald; McDonald, Michael; Meli, Marina L",Journal of feline medicine and surgery,4,1

Methods A total of 205 laboratory-confirmed inpatients admitted to Hankou hospital of Wuhan from January 11 to March 8, 2020 were consecutively included in this retrospective observational study. Demographic data, medical history, laboratory testing results were collected from medical records. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to evaluate the prognostic effect of the O-A interval (≤7 versus >7 days) on disease progression in mild-to-moderate patients. For severe-to-critical patients, the in-hospital mortality and the length of hospital stay were compared between the O-A interval subgroups using log-rank test and Mann-Whitney U test, respectively. Results Mild-to-moderate patients with a short O-A interval (≤7 days) are more likely to deteriorate to severe-to-critical stage compared to those with a long O-A interval (>7 days) [unadjusted odds ratio =2.93, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.32-6.55; adjusted odds ratio =3.44, 95% CI, 1.20-9.83]. No association was identified between the O-A interval and the mortality or the length of hospital stay of severe-to-critical patients. Conclusions The O-A interval has predictive values for the disease progression in mild-to-moderate COVID-19 patients. Under circumstances of the specific health system in Wuhan, China, the spontaneous healthcare-seeking behavior is usually determined by patients' own heath conditions. Hence, the O-A interval can be reflective of the natural course of COVID-19 to some extent.

Here, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 evades interferon (IFN) activation in respiratory epithelial cells, resulting in a delayed response in bystander cells. Since pretreatment with IFNs can block viral infection, we reasoned that pharmacological activation of innate immune pathways could control SARS-CoV-2 infection. To identify potent antiviral innate immune agonists, we screened a panel of 75 microbial ligands that activate diverse signaling pathways and identified cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs), canonical STING agonists, as antiviral. Since CDNs have poor bioavailability, we tested the small molecule STING agonist diABZI, and found that it potently inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection of diverse strains including variants of concern (B.1.351) by transiently stimulating IFN signaling. Importantly, diABZI restricts viral replication in primary human bronchial epithelial cells and in mice in vivo.

In favor of BTKi continuation, BTK plays an active role in macrophage polarization. By modulating key transcription factors, BTK may regulate macrophage polarization downstream of classic M1 and M2 polarizing stimuli and mitigate the hyperinflammatory state associated with COVID19. In favor of BTKi discontinuation, we note a potentially increased risk of secondary infections or impaired humoral immunity. We hypothesize that the potential benefit of blunting a hyper-inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 through attenuation of M1 polarization outweighs the potential risk of impaired humoral immunity, not to mention the risk of rapid progression of B-cell malignancy following BTKi interruption. Based on this, we suggest continuing BTKi in patients with COVID19.","Chong, Elise A; Roeker, Lindsey E; Shadman, Mazyar; Davids, Matthew S; Schuster, Stephen J; Mato, Anthony R",Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,4,17

Since the inception of PDT, obesity has been considered a relative contraindication to its use. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the risks of PDT in obese patients. STUDY DESIGN Retrospective review. METHODS A retrospective review was performed of prospectively collected data from 426 patients who underwent PDT at a single teaching institution from July 2003 to October 2009. The groups were separated into those who had a body mass index (BMI) of <30 or ≥30 kg/m(2) . The following variables were collected: blood loss at the time of procedure, difficulty in tracheotomy dilation and/or tracheostomy placement, presence of tracheal ring breaks, any bleeding episodes requiring treatment by surgery or blood transfusion, pre- and postprocedure pneumonia, and stoma infection requiring antibiotics. All tracheostomies were placed using the Ciaglia Blue Rhino Introducer Kit (Cook Medical Inc., Bloomington, IN). Statistical analysis was performed with nonparametric statistics using χ(2) testing with P < .05 as significant. RESULTS No statistically significant difference was found between the obese and nonobese groups for any of the variables studied. Similar results were found when BMI of 40 was used for grouping. CONCLUSIONS PDT can be performed safely in obese patients. There were no statistically significant differences in measured variables found between the two study groups. This study supports the use of intensive care unit bedside PDT in the obese population.","McCague, Andrew; Aljanabi, Harith; Wong, David T",The Laryngoscope,4,24

By assuming suitable conditional dependencies, one can model the effects of interventions (e.g., social distancing) and differences among populations (e.g., herd immunity) to predict what might happen in different circumstances. Technically, this model leverages state-of-the-art variational (Bayesian) model inversion and comparison procedures, originally developed to characterise the responses of neuronal ensembles to perturbations. Here, this modelling is applied to epidemiological populations-to illustrate the kind of inferences that are supported and how the model per se can be optimised given timeseries data.

However, this ubiquitous variability between individuals in brain structure is difficult to quantify and has thus essentially been ignored. Based on a large-scale structural magnetic resonance imaging dataset acquired from 162 cynomolgus macaques, we create a species-specific 3D template atlas of the macaque brain, and deploy normative modeling to characterize individual variations of cortical thickness (CT) and regional gray matter volume (GMV). We observed an overall decrease in total GMV and mean CT, and an increase in white matter volume from juvenile to early adult. Specifically, CT and regional GMV were greater in prefrontal and temporal cortices relative to early unimodal areas. Age-dependent trajectories of thickness and volume for each cortical region revealed an increase in the medial temporal lobe, and decreases in all other regions. A low percentage of highly individualized deviations of CT and GMV were identified (0.0021%, 0.0043%, respectively, P < 0.05, false discovery rate [FDR]-corrected).

Direct echocardiography imaging review has been shown to predict hemodynamic profiles in PH; however, routine use often overemphasizes Doppler-estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASPDE), which lacks discriminatory power among hemodynamically varied PH subgroups. In patients with PH of varying subtypes at a tertiary referral center, reported echocardiographic findings needed for VEST, including left atrial size, E:e' and systolic interventricular septal flattening, were obtained. Receiver operating characteristic analyses assessed the predictive performance of VEST vs. PASPDE in identifying PHPVD, which was later confirmed by right heart catheterization. VEST demonstrated far superior discriminatory power than PASPDE in identifying PHPVD. A positive score was 80.0% sensitive and 75.6% specific for PHPVD with an area under the curve of 0.81. PASPDE exhibited poorer discriminatory power with an area under the curve of 0.56. VEST's strong discriminatory ability remained unchanged when validated in a second cohort from another tertiary center. We demonstrated that this novel VEST using three routine parameters that can be easily extracted from standard echocardiographic reports can successfully capture PH patients with a high likelihood of PHPVD. During the Covid-19 pandemic, when right heart catheterization and timely access to experts at accredited PH centers may have limited widespread availability, this may assist physicians to rapidly and remotely evaluate PH patients to ensure timely and appropriate care.","Vaidya, Anjali; Golbus, Jessica R; Vedage, Natasha A; Mazurek, Jeremy; Raza, Farhan; Forfia, Paul R",Pulmonary circulation,4,1

Most recently, it has been widely utilized as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Most previous studies have not performed in-depth analyses of patient satisfaction with telehealth technologies. This project investigated patient satisfaction with the abrupt implementation of telemedicine within pediatric surgical subspecialties during the COVID-19 pandemic. Materials and Methods: We conducted a single-center review to determine patients' satisfaction with telemedicine during the early stages of the pandemic. Surveys were distributed to patients who completed a telemedicine video visit within a pediatric surgical subspecialty at Connecticut Children's Medical Center between March 16 and May 16, 2020. Results: A total of 1,608 patients were contacted, with 457 surveys completed (28.4%). Of all respondents, 95.6% were ""very satisfied"" or ""satisfied"" with their overall telemedicine appointment. Seventy-three percent reported no difficulty with completing their visit. Eighty-seven percent would consider another telemedicine visit again in the future. No significant difference was found between the payor mix for telemedicine and in-person appointments. Conclusions: The implementation of telemedicine at Connecticut Children's Medical Center during the COVID-19 pandemic was successful despite numerous barriers to use. Families not only showed high rates of satisfaction with the overall visit and provider interaction, but also an overwhelming openness to future use of telehealth.","Schmidtberg, Lauren C; Grindle, Christopher; Hersh, David S; Rowe, Courtney; Healy, James; Hughes, Christopher D",Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,4,16

Little is known as to how, where and with what affinity 20-HETE interacts with GPR75. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH To better understand the pairing of 20-HETE and its receptor (GPR75), we employed the use of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) to determine binding affinity/kinetics. The PRESTO-Tango receptor-ome methodology for GPR75 overexpression was coupled with FLIPR Calcium 6 assays, HTRF IP-1 and β-arrestin recruitment assays to determine receptor activation and downstream signaling events. KEY RESULTS SPR confirmed 20-HETE binding to GPR75 with an estimated KD of 1.56x10-10 M. In GPR75-transfected HTLA cells, 20-HETE stimulates intracellular Ca2+ levels, IP-1 accumulation and β-arrestin recruitment; all of which were negated by known 20-HETE functional antagonists. Computational modeling of the putative ligand-binding pocket and mutation of Thr212 within the putative 20-HETE binding site abolished 20-HETE's ability to stimulate GPR75 activation. Knockdown of GPR75 in human endothelial cells nullified 20-HETE-stimulated intracellular Ca2+ . The chemokine CCL5, a suggested GPR75 ligand, binds to GPR75 (KD of 5.85x10-10 M) yet fails to activate GPR75; however, it inhibited 20-HETE's ability to activate GPR75 signaling. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS Altogether, we identified 20-HETE as a high-affinity ligand for GPR75 and CCL5 as a low-affinity negative regulator of GPR75, providing additional evidence for the deorphanization of GPR75 as a 20-HETE receptor (20HR).","Pascale, Jonathan V; Park, Eon Joo; Adebesin, Adeniyi Michael; Falck, John R; Schwartzman, Michal Laniado; Garcia, Victor",British journal of pharmacology,4,1

Here we apply a local drug delivery strategy to combat local lung cancer recurrence after resection using non-woven, biodegradable nanofiber meshes loaded with cisplatin. The meshes are fabricated using a scalable electrospinning process from two biocompatible polymers--polycaprolactone and poly(glycerol monostearate-co-caprolactone)--to afford favorable mechanical properties for use in a dynamic tissue such as the lung. Owing to their rough nanostructure and hydrophobic polymer composition, these meshes exhibit superhydrophobicity, and it is this non-wetting nature that sustains the release of cisplatin in a linear fashion over ∼90 days, with anti-cancer efficacy demonstrated using an in vitro Lewis Lung carcinoma (LLC) cell assay. The in vivo evaluation of cisplatin-loaded superhydrophobic meshes in the prevention of local cancer recurrence in a murine model of LLC surgical resection demonstrated a statistically significant increase (p = 0.0006) in median recurrence-free survival to >23 days, compared to standard intraperitoneal cisplatin therapy of equivalent dose. These results emphasize the importance of supplementing cytoreductive surgery with local drug delivery strategies to improve prognosis for lung cancer patients undergoing tumor resection.","Kaplan, Jonah A; Liu, Rong; Freedman, Jonathan D; Padera, Robert; Schwartz, John; Colson, Yolonda L; Grinstaff, Mark W",Biomaterials,4,26

At Kaiser Permanente, we implemented a program wherein health care providers drawn from multiple disciplines perform daily telemedicine check-ins on COVID-19 patients, allowing us to both maintain social distancing and make use of providers in specialties who otherwise may have had lower in-clinic volumes. Methods: Kaiser Permanente patients testing positive for COVID-19 between March and October 2020 were referred to our program. Physicians and nurses (RNs) were invited to participate in our program and were trained using Microsoft Teams™ meetings. Patients receive daily phone calls by a physician or RN. Select patients receive portable pulse oximeter devices based on standardized criteria incorporating age and comorbidities. When patients are determined to be clinically stable, they are discharged back to their primary care physician for ongoing management. Results: Descriptive results for the virtual home care program (VHCP) are reported through October 2020, though these results do not represent a planned statistical analysis. Forty-two percent of the patients were male, 43% were black, and 30% were Hispanic. The most common comorbidities of patients in our program were obesity (body mass index >30 kg/m2; 35%), followed by hypertension (32%) and diabetes mellitus (19%). Then, 8.2% of patients ultimately required hospital admission. Mortality rate for patients in our program was 1.33%. Discussion: Our program was able to provide virtual care for thousands of COVID-19 positive Kaiser members in the Washington, DC, and Baltimore Metro regions. We did so by utilizing physicians and RNs from specialties experiencing a decrease in clinic volume attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic. The experiences of our program may be valuable to clinicians wishing to establish similar programs of their own.","Shaw, James G; Sankineni, Sandeep; Olaleye, Charles A; Johnson, Kari L; Locke, Jessica L; Patino, John; Sabi, Farzaneh L; McCarthy, Richard J",Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,4,1

The purpose of this multicenter retrospective study was to evaluate the natural progression of the synovial fluid WBC count, PMN percentage, and total neutrophil count in patients who underwent knee aspiration during the first two years after primary total knee arthroplasty and had no evidence of periprosthetic joint infection. METHODS From April 1999 to March 2012, 571 patients who presented within the first two years after primary total knee arthroplasty underwent knee aspiration as part of an evaluation for periprosthetic joint infection. Patients were categorized into four groups on the basis of the number of days between surgery and arthrocentesis. The synovial fluid WBC count, PMN percentage, and total neutrophil count were compared among the four time periods with use of separate one-way analyses of variance and Tamhane post-hoc analyses. RESULTS Four hundred and fifty-two samples not associated with a periprosthetic joint infection were adequate for analysis. The synovial fluid WBC count, PMN percentage, and total neutrophil count all decreased after the first ninety postoperative days. The synovial fluid WBC count showed an earlier return to a level similar to the two-year time point than the PMN percentage did. The mean total neutrophil count decreased from 2533.2 cells/μL during the first forty-five days to 649.0 cells/μL from forty-six to ninety days, 269.5 cells/μL from three months to one year, and 240.8 cells/μL from one to two years. CONCLUSIONS The synovial fluid WBC count and PMN percentage changed at different rates over the first two years after total knee arthroplasty, with the WBC count exhibiting an initially more rapid decrease and the PMN percentage demonstrating a more linear decrease. Hence, the total neutrophil count, which combines these two parameters, may provide a better method to identify patients with a periprosthetic joint infection. Values for the synovial fluid WBC count, PMN percentage, and total neutrophil count were all significantly elevated in the early postoperative period, and the use of standard cutoff values for the diagnosis of periprosthetic joint infection can lead to false-positive results.","Christensen, Christian P; Bedair, Hany; Della Valle, Craig J; Parvizi, Javad; Schurko, Brian; Jacobs, Cale A",The Journal of bone and joint surgery.

It does not allow for sufficient surgical views to be obtained or for intraoperative radiographic cholangiography to be performed. Fluorescent cholangiography using a preoperative intravenous injection of indocyanine green (ICG) may be useful for identifying the biliary tract during both SILC and conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy. METHODS For seven patients undergoing SILC, 1 ml of ICG (2.5 mg) was administered by intravenous injection before the surgery. The prototype fluorescent imaging system consisted of a xenon light source and a 30° laparoscope (diameter, 10 mm) equipped with a charge-coupled device camera capable of filtering out light with wavelengths shorter than 810 nm. The laparoscope was introduced through an umbilical trocar. Fluorescent cholangiography then was performed by changing the color images to fluorescent images using a foot switch during dissection of the triangle of Calot. RESULTS Fluorescent cholangiography identified the confluence between the cystic duct and the common hepatic duct in all seven patients before and throughout the dissection of the triangle of Calot. The interval from the injection of ICG to the first obtained fluorescent cholangiography before dissection of the triangle of Calot ranged from 35 to 75 min. CONCLUSIONS Fluorescent cholangiography enabled real-time identification of the extrahepatic bile ducts during SILC without necessitating catheterization of the bile duct. Such properties of fluorescent cholangiography are expected to be helpful for ensuring the safety of SILC and expanding the indications for the procedure.","Ishizawa, Takeaki; Kaneko, Junichi; Inoue, Yosuke; Takemura, Nobuyuki; Seyama, Yasuji; Aoki, Taku; Beck, Yoshifumi; Sugawara, Yasuhiko; Hasegawa, Kiyoshi; Harada, Nobuhiro; Ijichi, Masayoshi; Kusaka, Koji; Shibasaki, Masayuki; Bandai, Yasutsugu; Kokudo, Norihiro",Surgical endoscopy,4,1

However, little is known about the impact of mental health treatments on IPV victimization or perpetration, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). METHODS We conducted a systematic review to identify prospective, controlled studies of mental health treatments in LMIC. We defined 'mental health treatment' as an intervention for individuals experiencing mental ill health (including substance misuse) including a substantial psychosocial or pharmacological component. Studies had to measure a mental health and IPV outcome. We searched across multi-disciplinary databases using a structured search strategy. Screening of title/abstracts and full-text eligibility assessments were conducted by two researchers independently, data were extracted using a piloted spreadsheet, and a narrative synthesis was generated. RESULTS We identified seven studies reported in 11 papers conducted in five middle-income countries. With the exception of blinding, studies overall showed acceptable levels of risk of bias. Four of the seven studies focused on dedicated mental health treatments in various populations, including: common mental disorders in earthquake survivors; depression in primary care; alcohol misuse in men; and alcohol misuse in female adult sex workers. The dedicated mental health treatments targeting depression or alcohol misuse consistently reduced levels of these outcomes. The two studies targeting depression also reduced short-term IPV, but no IPV benefits were identified in the two alcohol-focused studies. The other three studies evaluated integrated interventions, in which a focus on substance misuse was part of efforts to reduce HIV/AIDS and violence against particularly vulnerable women. In contrast to the dedicated mental health interventions, the integrated interventions did not consistently reduce mental ill health or alcohol misuse compared to control conditions. CONCLUSIONS Too few studies have been conducted to judge whether mental health treatments may provide a beneficial strategy to prevent or reduce IPV in LMIC. Key future research questions include: whether promising initial evidence on the effects of depression interventions on reducing IPV hold more broadly, the required intensity of mental health components in integrated interventions, and the identification of mechanisms of IPV that are amenable to mental health intervention.","Tol, W A; Murray, S M; Lund, C; Bolton, P; Murray, L K; Davies, T; Haushofer, J; Orkin, K; Witte, M; Salama, L; Patel, V; Thornicroft, G; Bass, J K",BMC women's health,4,16

74292,74292,74292,The Benefits and Perils of Necroptosis in Influenza Infection.,11.654245,7.909357,2020-02-12,"Streptococcus agalactiae (Group B Streptococcus, GBS) is a common commensal bacterium in adults but remains a leading source of invasive infections in newborns, pregnant women, and the elderly, and more recently, causes an increased incidence of invasive disease in nonpregnant adults. Reduced penicillin susceptibility and emerging resistance to non-β-lactams pose challenges for the development and implementation of novel, nonantimicrobial strategies to reduce the burden of GBS infections. Antimicrobial photodynamic inactivation (aPDI) via the production of singlet oxygen or other reactive oxygen species leads to the successful eradication of pathogenic bacteria, affecting numerous cellular targets of microbial pathogens and indicating a low risk of resistance development. Nevertheless, we have previously reported possible aPDI tolerance development upon repeated sublethal aPDI applications; thus, the current work was aimed at investigating whether aPDI tolerance could be observed for GBS and what mechanisms could cause it. To address this problem, 10 cycles of sublethal aPDI treatments employing rose bengal as a photosensitizer, were applied to the S. agalactiae ATCC 27956 reference strain and two clinical isolates (2306/02 and 2974/07, serotypes III and V, respectively). We demonstrated aPDI tolerance development and stability after 5 cycles of subculturing with no aPDI exposure. Though the treatment resulted in a stable phenotype, no increases in mutation rate or accumulated genetic alterations were observed (employing a RIF-, CIP-, STR-resistant mutant selection assay and cyl sequencing, respectively). qRT-PCR analysis demonstrated that 10 sublethal aPDI exposures led to increased expression of all tested major oxidative stress response elements; changes in sodA, ahpC, npx, cylE, tpx and recA expression indicate possible mechanisms of developed tolerance. Increased expression upon sublethal aPDI treatment was reported for all but two genes, namely, ahpC and cylE. aPDI targeting cylE was further supported by colony morphology changes induced with 10 cycles of aPDI (increased SCV population, increased hemolysis, increased numbers of dark- and unpigmented colonies). In oxidant killing assays, aPDI-tolerant strains demonstrated no increased tolerance to hypochlorite, superoxide (paraquat), singlet oxygen (new methylene blue) or oxidative stress induced by aPDI employing a structurally different photosensitizer, i.e., zinc phthalocyanine, indicating a lack of cross resistance. The results indicate that S. agalactiae may develop stable aPDI tolerance but not resistance when subjected to multiple sublethal phototreatments, and this risk should be considered significant when defining efficient anti-S. agalactiae aPDI protocols.","Pieranski, Michal; Sitkiewicz, Izabela; Grinholc, Mariusz",Free radical biology & medicine,4,1

This study aimed to evaluate the association between surgical wait time and oncologic outcomes for patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC). MATERIALS AND METHODS The Canadian Kidney Cancer information system (CKCis) is a multi-institutional prospective cohort initiated in January 2011. Patients with clinical stage T1b or greater RCC diagnosed between January 2011 to December 2019 were included in this analysis. Outcomes of interest were pathologic upstaging, cancer recurrence, cancer-specific survival, and overall survival. Time to recurrence and death were estimated using Kaplan-Meier estimates and associations were determined using cox-proportional hazards models. RESULTS 1,769 patients satisfied the study criteria. Median wait times were 54 days (IQR 29-86) for the overall cohort and 81 days (IQR 49-127) for cT1b tumors (n=1166), 45 days (IQR 27-71) for cT2 tumors (n=672), and 35 days (IQR 18-61) for cT3/4 tumors (n=563 tumors). Adjusting for comorbidity, tumor size, grade, histologic subtype, margin status, and pathologic stage, there was no association between prolonged wait time and cancer recurrence or death. CONCLUSION In the context of current surgeon triaging practices, surgical wait times up to 24 weeks were not associated with adverse oncologic outcomes after 2 years of follow-up.","Shiff, Benjamin; Breau, Rodney H; Patel, Premal; Mallick, Ranjeeta; Tanguay, Simon; So, Alan; Lavallée, Luke; Moore, Ron; Rendon, Ricardo; Kapoor, Anil; Pouliot, Frédéric; Finelli, Antonio; Bhindi, Bimal; Lattouf, Jean-Baptiste; Basappa, Naveen; Wood, Lori; Heng, Daniel; Bjarnason, Georg; Drachenberg, Darrel",The Journal of urology,4,19

Being homebound is associated with decreased access to medical services, poor health outcomes, and increased mortality. Yet, it is unknown what factors, in particular socioeconomic factors, are associated with new onset of homebound status. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the association between income and risk of becoming homebound. DESIGN Observational cohort study using 2011 to 2018 data from the National Health and Aging Trends Study, a nationally representative sample of Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years and older. SETTING Population-based study in the United States. PARTICIPANTS A total of 7,042 initially nonhomebound community-dwelling older adults. EXPOSURE Total annual household income at baseline (in 2011) measured via self-report. OUTCOME Annual measure of homebound status, defined as leaving home an average of 1 d/wk or less. RESULTS Over 7 years, 15.81% of older adults in the lowest income quartile (≤$15,003) became homebound, compared with only 4.64% of those in the highest income quartile (>$60,000). In a competing risks analysis accounting for risks of death and nursing home admission, and adjusted for clinical and demographic characteristics, those in the lowest income quartile had a substantially higher subhazard of becoming homebound than those in the highest income quartile (1.65; 95% confidence interval = 1.20-2.29). Moreover, we see evidence of a gradient in risk of homebound status by income quartile. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE Our work demonstrates that financial resources shape the risk of becoming homebound, which is associated with negative health consequences. In the context of existing income disparities, more support is needed to assist older adults with limited financial resources who wish to remain in the community.","Ornstein, Katherine A; Garrido, Melissa M; Bollens-Lund, Evan; Reckrey, Jennifer M; Husain, Mohammed; Ferreira, Katelyn B; Liu, Shelley H; Ankuda, Claire K; Kelley, Amy S; Siu, Albert L",Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,4,16

Although not problematic per se, desire thinking can become dysfunctional if it is used to regulate negative mood states and due to its ability to induce craving. This study tests a mediation model where desire thinking is hypothesized to mediate the association between emotional reactivity and craving among specific online activities. METHODS The study comprised an online survey that was completed by 925 participants who indicated that their first-choice online activity was one out of social-networks use, shopping, gaming, gambling, or pornography viewing. In this sample, a structural equation model was tested where negative emotional reactivity, desire thinking, and craving were latently modelled in this serial order. RESULTS Results indicated that higher levels in negative emotional reactivity significantly predicted higher desire thinking tendencies, which in turn significantly predicted higher cravings for online activities. The direct path between negative reactivity and craving was not significant. Further, our results support the two-factorial structure of a German version of the Desire Thinking Questionnaire (Caselli & Spada, 2011). DISCUSSION The findings show that desire thinking might be initiated as an attempt to regulate negative affective states. This highlights its possible role as a maladaptive coping mechanism in the context of specific online activities due to the resulting craving responses, which in turn could promote the emergence of unwanted behaviors.","Brandtner, Annika; Brand, Matthias",Addictive behaviors,4,1

Effective treatment for COVID-19 is urgently needed. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the antiviral effect of Arbidol vs. Chloroquine in treating COVID-19. METHODS We retrospectively analyzed 62 patients with COVID-19 diagnosed according to the guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 in China. They were divided into two groups depending on the antiviral drugs that they received. Participants in the Arbidol group (n=42) received 0.2 g Arbidol, tid for 10 days,and those in Chloroquine group (n=20) received 500 mg Chloroquine, bid for 10 days. The coronavirus negative conversion time and the length of hospital stay were analyzed and compared between the two groups. RESULTS There was no significant difference in demographic and clinical characteristics between the two groups. After antiviral treatment, the nasopharyngeal specimen negative conversion time of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the length of hospital stay in the Arbidol group were significantly shorter than those in the Chloroquine group (18.50 vs. 25.05 days, P=0.001; 23.52 vs. 28.75 days, P=0.001). Adverse events observed during the antiviral treatment period were comparable between the two groups. Overall, 3 (7.14%) participants in the Arbidol group and 4 (20.0%) in the Chloroquine group experienced adverse events during antiviral treatment. CONCLUSIONS These results suggest that Arbidol is advantageous over Chloroquine in terms of the SARS-CoV-2 negative conversion and the length of hospital stay in treating COVID-19 patients.","Li, Ming; Yu, Tongya; Zhu, Jinghua; Wang, Yinjia; Yang, Yanxia; Zhao, Kaiwu; Yi, Yongning; He, Juan; Li, Chao; He, Jian",Annals of palliative medicine,4,29

METHODS The AATS established the Lung Cancer Screening and Surveillance Task Force with multidisciplinary representation including 4 thoracic surgeons, 4 thoracic radiologists, 4 medical oncologists, 1 pulmonologist, 1 pathologist, and 1 epidemiologist. Members have engaged in interdisciplinary collaborations regarding lung cancer screening and clinical care of patients with, and at risk for, lung cancer. The task force reviewed the literature, including screening trials in the United States and Europe, and discussed local best clinical practices in the United States and Canada on 4 conference calls. A reference library supported the discussions and increased individual study across disciplines. The task force met to review the literature, state of clinical practice, and recommend consensus-based guidelines. RESULTS Nine of 14 task force members were present at the meeting, and 3 participated by telephone. Two absent task force members were polled afterward. Six unanimous recommendations and supporting work-up algorithms were presented to the Council of the AATS at the 2012 annual meeting in San Francisco, California. CONCLUSIONS Annual lung cancer screening and surveillance with low-dose computed tomography is recommended for smokers and former smokers with a 30 pack-year history of smoking and long-term lung cancer survivors aged 55 to 79 years. Screening may begin at age 50 years with a 20 pack-year history of smoking and additional comorbidity that produces a cumulative risk of developing lung cancer of 5% or greater over the following 5 years. Screening should be undertaken with a subspecialty qualified interdisciplinary team. Patient risk calculator application and intersociety engagement will provide data needed to refine future lung cancer screening guidelines.","Jacobson, Francine L; Austin, John H M; Field, John K; Jett, James R; Keshavjee, Shaf; MacMahon, Heber; Mulshine, James L; Munden, Reginald F; Salgia, Ravi; Strauss, Gary M; Sugarbaker, David J; Swanson, Scott J; Travis, William D; Jaklitsch, Michael T",The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,4,1

Within primary care, health workers often use mobile devices to register clients, track their health, and make decisions about care, as well as to communicate with clients and other health workers. An understanding of how health workers relate to, and experience mHealth, can help in its implementation. OBJECTIVES To synthesise qualitative research evidence on health workers' perceptions and experiences of using mHealth technologies to deliver primary healthcare services, and to develop hypotheses about why some technologies are more effective than others. SEARCH METHODS We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Science Citation Index and Social Sciences Citation Index in January 2018. We searched Global Health in December 2015. We screened the reference lists of included studies and key references and searched seven sources for grey literature (16 February to 5 March 2018). We re-ran the search strategies in February 2020. We screened these records and any studies that we identified as potentially relevant are awaiting classification. SELECTION CRITERIA We included studies that used qualitative data collection and analysis methods. We included studies of mHealth programmes that were part of primary healthcare services. These services could be implemented in public or private primary healthcare facilities, community and workplace, or the homes of clients. We included all categories of health workers, as well as those persons who supported the delivery and management of the mHealth programmes. We excluded participants identified as technical staff who developed and maintained the mHealth technology, without otherwise being involved in the programme delivery. We included studies conducted in any country. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS We assessed abstracts, titles and full-text papers according to the inclusion criteria. We found 53 studies that met the inclusion criteria and sampled 43 of these for our analysis. For the 43 sampled studies, we extracted information, such as country, health worker category, and the mHealth technology. We used a thematic analysis process. We used GRADE-CERQual to assess our confidence in the findings. MAIN RESULTS Most of the 43 included sample studies were from low- or middle-income countries. In many of the studies, the mobile devices had decision support software loaded onto them, which showed the steps the health workers had to follow when they provided health care. Other uses included in-person and/or text message communication, and recording clients' health information. Almost half of the studies looked at health workers' use of mobile devices for mother, child, and newborn health. We have moderate or high confidence in the following findings. mHealth changed how health workers worked with each other: health workers appreciated being more connected to colleagues, and thought that this improved co-ordination and quality of care. However, some described problems when senior colleagues did not respond or responded in anger. Some preferred face-to-face connection with colleagues. Some believed that mHealth improved their reporting, while others compared it to ""big brother watching"". mHealth changed how health workers delivered care: health workers appreciated how mHealth let them take on new tasks, work flexibly, and reach clients in difficult-to-reach areas. They appreciated mHealth when it improved feedback, speed and workflow, but not when it was slow or time consuming. Some health workers found decision support software useful; others thought it threatened their clinical skills. Most health workers saw mHealth as better than paper, but some preferred paper. Some health workers saw mHealth as creating more work. mHealth led to new forms of engagement and relationships with clients and communities: health workers felt that communicating with clients by mobile phone improved care and their relationships with clients, but felt that some clients needed face-to-face contact. Health workers were aware of the importance of protecting confidential client information when using mobile devices. Some health workers did not mind being contacted by clients outside working hours, while others wanted boundaries. Health workers described how some community members trusted health workers that used mHealth while others were sceptical. Health workers pointed to problems when clients needed to own their own phones. Health workers' use and perceptions of mHealth could be influenced by factors tied to costs, the health worker, the technology, the health system and society, poor network access, and poor access to electricity: some health workers did not mind covering extra costs. Others complained that phone credit was not delivered on time. Health workers who were accustomed to using mobile phones were sometimes more positive towards mHealth. Others with less experience, were sometimes embarrassed about making mistakes in front of clients or worried about job security. Health workers wanted training, technical support, user-friendly devices, and systems that were integrated into existing electronic health systems. The main challenges health workers experienced were poor network connections, access to electricity, and the cost of recharging phones. Other problems included damaged phones. Factors outside the health system also influenced how health workers experienced mHealth, including language, gender, and poverty issues. Health workers felt that their commitment to clients helped them cope with these challenges. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Our findings propose a nuanced view about mHealth programmes. The complexities of healthcare delivery and human interactions defy simplistic conclusions on how health workers will perceive and experience their use of mHealth. Perceptions reflect the interplay between the technology, contexts, and human attributes. Detailed descriptions of the programme, implementation processes and contexts, alongside effectiveness studies, will help to unravel this interplay to formulate hypotheses regarding the effectiveness of mHealth.","Odendaal, Willem A; Anstey Watkins, Jocelyn; Leon, Natalie; Goudge, Jane; Griffiths, Frances; Tomlinson, Mark; Daniels, Karen",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,4,19

Like all mechanical devices, they are vulnerable to failure. The precise physiological consequences of failure in live subjects have not previously been reported. We conducted an observational safety study simulating PAPR failure in a group of nine healthy volunteers, wearing loose-fitting hoods, who were observed for a period of ten minutes, or until they requested the experiment be aborted, with continuous monitoring of gas exchange. Relative to baseline, participants demonstrated median reductions in peripheral oxygen saturation of 3.5% (95% confidence interval (CI) -4% to -2%; P = 0.0039) and fraction of inspired oxygen of 0.045 (95% CI -0.05 to -0.04; P = 0.0039), and median increases in inspired partial pressure of carbon dioxide of 27 mmHg (95% CI 23.5-32 mmHg; P = 0.0039), end-tidal partial pressure of carbon dioxide of 11 mmHg (95% CI 7-16 mmHg; P = 0.0039) and minute ventilation of 30 l/min (95% CI 19.4-35.9 l/min; P = 0.0039).

Many insights into the molecular biology of NNS viruses were first made in VSV, which is often studied as a prototype for members of this order. Like other NNS viruses, the VSV RNA polymerase consists of a complex of the large protein (L) and phosphoprotein (P). Recent discoveries have produced a model in which the N-terminal disordered segment of P (PNTD) coordinates the C-terminal accessory domains to produce a ""compacted"" L conformation. Despite this advancement, the role of the three phosphorylation sites in PNTD has remained unknown. Using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to analyze the interactions between PNTD and the L protein C-terminal domain (LCTD), we demonstrated our ability to sensitively test for changes in the interface between the two proteins. This method showed that the binding site for PNTD on LCTD is longer than was previously appreciated. We demonstrated that phosphorylation of PNTD modulates its interaction with LCTD and used a minigenome reporter system to validate the functional significance of the PNTD-LCTD interaction. Using an electron microscopy approach, we showed that L bound to phosphorylated PNTD displays increased conformational heterogeneity in solution. Taken as a whole, our studies suggest a model in which phosphorylation of PNTD modulates its cofactor and conformational regulatory activities with L.IMPORTANCE Polymerase-cofactor interactions like those addressed in this study are absolute requirements for mononegavirus RNA synthesis. Despite cofactor phosphorylation being present in most of these interactions, what effect if any it has on this protein-protein interaction had not been addressed. Our study is the first to address the effects of phosphorylation on P during its interactions with L in residue-by-residue detail. As phosphorylation is the biologically relevant state of the cofactor, our demonstration of its effects on L conformation suggest that the structural picture of L during infection might be more complex than previously appreciated.","Gould, Joseph R; Qiu, Shihong; Shang, Qiao; Dokland, Terje; Ogino, Tomoaki; Petit, Chad M; Green, Todd J",Journal of virology,4,33

We report a novel experimental strategy, TAMBAS (Tandem Approach for Microphysical and Biological Assessment of Airborne Microorganisms Survival), to explore the synergistic interactions between the physicochemical and biological processes that impact airborne microbe survival in aerosol droplets. This innovative approach provides a unique and detailed understanding of the processes taking place from aerosol droplet generation through to equilibration and viability decay in the local environment, elucidating decay mechanisms not previously described. The impact of evaporation kinetics, solute hygroscopicity and concentration, particle morphology and equilibrium particle size on airborne survival are reported, using Escherichia coli (MRE162) as a benchmark system. For this system, we report that the particle crystallisation does not directly impact microbe longevity, bacteria act as crystallization nuclei during droplet drying and equilibration, and the kinetics of size and compositional change appear to have a larger effect on microbe longevity than equilibrium solute concentration.IMPORTANCE A transformative approach to identify the physicochemical processes that impact the biological decay rates of bacteria in aerosol droplets is described. It is shown that the evaporation process and changes in the phase and morphology of the aerosol particle during evaporation impact microorganism viability. The equilibrium droplet size was found to affect airborne bacterial viability. Furthermore, the presence of Escherichia coli (MRE162) in a droplet does not affect aerosol growth/evaporation, but influences the dynamic behaviour of the aerosol through processing the culture media prior to aerosolization affecting the hygroscopicity of the culture medium; this highlights the importance of the inorganic and organic chemical composition within the aerosolised droplets that impact hygroscopicity. Bacteria act also as a crystallisation nucleus. The novel approach and data has implications for increased mechanistic understanding of aerosol survival and infectivity in bioaerosol studies spanning medical, veterinary, farming, and agricultural fields, including the role of micro-organisms in atmospheric processing and cloud formation.","Otero Fernandez, Mara; Thomas, Richard J; Oswin, Henry; Haddrell, Allen E; Reid, Jonathan P",Applied and environmental microbiology,4,31

Internet panel members, nationally representative based on age, sex, educational level and region, of four European Union Member States (Netherlands, Poland, Spain, and Sweden, n = 2,068) completed an online discrete choice experiment. These countries, from different geographical areas of Europe, were chosen because of the availability of high-quality Internet panels and because of the cooperation between members of the project entitled Effective Communication in Outbreak Management: development of an evidence-based tool for Europe (ECOM). Data were analysed using panel latent class regression models. In the case of a severe pandemic scenario, vaccine effectiveness was the most important characteristic determining vaccination preference in all countries, followed by the body that advises on vaccination. In Sweden, the advice of family and/or friends and the advice of physicians strongly affected vaccine preferences, in contrast to Poland and Spain, where the advice of (international) health authorities was more decisive. Irrespective of pandemic scenario or vaccination programme characteristics, the predicted vaccination uptakes were lowest in Sweden, and highest in Poland. To increase vaccination uptake during future pandemics, the responsible authorities should align with other important stakeholders in the country and communicate in a coordinated manner.","Determann, Domino; Korfage, Ida J; Fagerlin, Angela; Steyerberg, Ewout W; Bliemer, Michiel C; Voeten, Helene A; Richardus, Jan Hendrik; Lambooij, Mattijs S; de Bekker-Grob, Esther W",Euro surveillance : bulletin Europeen sur les maladies transmissibles = European communicable disease bulletin,4,1

Corneal endothelial transplantation has been described using two different techniques: Descemet's membrane endothelial keratoplasty (DMEK) and Descemet's stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK). Both are still performed worldwide. OBJECTIVES To compare the effectiveness and safety of Descemet's membrane endothelial keratoplasty (DMEK) versus Descemet's stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK) for the treatment of corneal endothelial failure in people with Fuch's endothelial dystropy (FED) and pseudophakic bullous keratopathy (PBK). SEARCH METHODS We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2017, Issue 7); MEDLINE Ovid; Embase Ovid; LILACS BIREME; the ISRCTN registry; ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). The date of the search was 11 August 2017. SELECTION CRITERIA We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomised paired, contralateral-eye studies in any setting where DMEK was compared with DSAEK to treat people with corneal endothelial failure. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently screened the search results, assessed trial quality and extracted data using the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcome was best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) measured in logarithm of the Minimum Angle of Resolution (logMAR). Secondary outcomes were endothelial cell count, graft rejection, primary graft failure and graft dislocation. We graded the risk of bias of non-randomised studies (NRSs) using ROBINS-I. MAIN RESULTS We did not identify any RCTs but found four non-randomised studies (NRSs) including 72 participants (144 eyes), who had received DSAEK in the first eye followed by DMEK in the fellow eye. All the studies included adult participants where there was evidence of FED and endothelial failure requiring a corneal transplant for the treatment of visual impairment. We did not find any studies that included PBK. The trials were published between 2011 and 2015, and we assessed them as high risk of bias due to potential unknown confounding factors since DSAEK preceded DMEK in all participants. Two studies reported results at 12 months, one at 6 months, and one between 6 and 24 months. At one year, using DMEK in cases of endothelial failure may result in better BCVA compared with DSAEK (mean difference (MD) -0.14, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.18 to -0.10 logMAR, 4 studies, 140 eyes, low-certainty evidence). None of the participants had severe visual loss (BCVA of 1.0 logMAR or more; very low-certainty evidence). Regarding endothelial cell count data (4 studies, 134 eyes) it is hard to draw any conclusions since two studies suggested no difference and the other two reported that DMEK provides a higher cell density at one year (very low-certainty evidence). No primary graft failure and only one graft rejection were recorded over four studies (144 eyes) (very low-certainty evidence). The most common complications reported were graft dislocations, which were recorded in one or two out of 100 participants with DSAEK but were more common using DMEK, although this difference could not be precisely estimated (risk ratio (RR) 5.40, 95% CI 1.51 to 19.3; 4 studies, 144 eyes, very low-certainty evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS This review included studies conducted on people with corneal endothelium failure due to FED for whom both DMEK and DSAEK can be considered, and found low-certainty evidence that DMEK provides some advantage in terms of final BCVA, at the cost of more graft dislocations needing 're-bubbling' (very low-certainty of evidence).","Stuart, Alastair J; Romano, Vito; Virgili, Gianni; Shortt, Alex J",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,4,1

So far, the mechanisms underlying sleep disruptions in AUD are poorly understood. Because sleep-related regions vastly overlap with regions, where patients with AUD showed pronounced grey matter (GM) reduction; we hypothesized that GM structure could contribute to sleep disturbances associated with chronic alcohol use. We combined sleep EEG recording and high-resolution structural brain imaging to examine the GM-sleep associations in 36 AUD vs. 26 healthy controls (HC). The patterns of GM-sleep associations differed for N3 vs. REM sleep and for AUD vs. HC. For cortical thickness (CT), CT-sleep associations were significant in AUD but not in HC and were lateralized such that lower CT in right hemisphere was associated with shorter N3, whereas in left hemisphere was associated with shorter REM sleep. For the GM density (GMD), we observed a more extensive positive GMD-N3 association in AUD (right orbitofrontal cortex, cerebellum, dorsal cingulate and occipital cortex) than in HC (right orbitofrontal cortex), and the GMD-REM association was positive in AUD (midline, motor and paralimbic regions) whereas negative in HC (the left supramarginal gyrus). GM structure mediated the effect of chronic alcohol use on the duration of N3 and the age by alcohol effect on REM sleep. Our findings provide evidence that sleep disturbances in AUD were associated with GM reductions. Targeting sleep-related regions might improve sleep in AUD and enhance sleep-induced benefits in cognition and emotional regulation for recovery.","Zhang, Rui; Tomasi, Dardo; Manza, Peter; Shokri-Kojori, Ehsan; Demiral, Sukru B; Feldman, Dana E; Kroll, Danielle S; Biesecker, Catherine L; McPherson, Katherine L; Wang, Gene-Jack; Wiers, Corinde E; Volkow, Nora D",Translational psychiatry,4,7

Postoperative delirium, an acute condition characterized by reduced awareness of the environment and a disturbance in attention, typically occurs between 24 and 72 hours after surgery and can affect up to 60% of elderly surgical patients. Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a new-onset of cognitive impairment which may persist for weeks or months after surgery.Traditionally, surgical anaesthesia has been maintained with inhalational agents. End-tidal concentrations require adjustment to balance the risks of accidental awareness and excessive dosing in elderly people. As an alternative, propofol-based total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) offers a more rapid recovery and reduces postoperative nausea and vomiting. Using TIVA with a target controlled infusion (TCI) allows plasma and effect-site concentrations to be calculated using an algorithm based on age, gender, weight and height of the patient.TIVA is a viable alternative to inhalational maintenance agents for surgical anaesthesia in elderly people. However, in terms of postoperative cognitive outcomes, the optimal technique is unknown. OBJECTIVES To compare maintenance of general anaesthesia for elderly people undergoing non-cardiac surgery using propofol-based TIVA or inhalational anaesthesia on postoperative cognitive function, mortality, risk of hypotension, length of stay in the postanaesthesia care unit (PACU), and hospital stay. SEARCH METHODS We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2017, Issue 11), MEDLINE (1946 to November 2017), Embase (1974 to November 2017), PsycINFO (1887 to November 2017). We searched clinical trials registers for ongoing studies, and conducted backward and forward citation searching of relevant articles. SELECTION CRITERIA We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with participants over 60 years of age scheduled for non-cardiac surgery under general anaesthesia. We planned to also include quasi-randomized trials. We compared maintenance of anaesthesia with propofol-based TIVA versus inhalational maintenance of anaesthesia. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data, assessed risk of bias, and synthesized findings. MAIN RESULTS We included 28 RCTs with 4507 randomized participants undergoing different types of surgery (predominantly cardiovascular, laparoscopic, abdominal, orthopaedic and ophthalmic procedures). We found no quasi-randomized trials. Four studies are awaiting classification because we had insufficient information to assess eligibility.All studies compared maintenance with propofol-based TIVA versus inhalational maintenance of anaesthesia. Six studies were multi-arm and included additional TIVA groups, additional inhalational maintenance or both. Inhalational maintenance agents included sevoflurane (19 studies), isoflurane (eight studies), and desflurane (three studies), and was not specified in one study (reported as an abstract). Some studies also reported use of epidural analgesia/anaesthesia, fentanyl and remifentanil.We found insufficient reporting of randomization methods in many studies and all studies were at high risk of performance bias because it was not feasible to blind anaesthetists to study groups. Thirteen studies described blinding of outcome assessors. Three studies had a high of risk of attrition bias, and we noted differences in the use of analgesics between groups in six studies, and differences in baseline characteristics in five studies. Few studies reported clinical trials registration, which prevented assessment of risk of selective reporting bias.We found no evidence of a difference in incidences of postoperative delirium according to type of anaesthetic maintenance agents (odds ratio (OR) 0.59, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.15 to 2.26; 321 participants; five studies; very low-certainty evidence); we noted during sensitivity analysis that using different time points in one study may influence direction of this result. Thirteen studies (3215 participants) reported POCD, and of these, six studies reported data that could not be pooled; we noted no difference in scores of POCD in four of these and in one study, data were at a time point incomparable to other studies. We excluded one large study from meta-analysis because study investigators had used non-standard anaesthetic management and this study was not methodologically comparable to other studies. We combined data for seven studies and found low-certainty evidence that TIVA may reduce POCD (OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.87; 869 participants).We found no evidence of a difference in mortality at 30 days (OR 1.21, 95% CI 0.33 to 4.45; 271 participants; three studies; very low-certainty evidence). Twelve studies reported intraoperative hypotension. We did not perform meta-analysis for 11 studies for this outcome. We noted visual inconsistencies in these data, which may be explained by possible variation in clinical management and medication used to manage hypotension in each study (downgraded to low-certainty evidence); one study reported data in a format that could not be combined and we noted little or no difference between groups in intraoperative hypotension for this study. Eight studies reported length of stay in the PACU, and we did not perform meta-analysis for seven studies. We noted visual inconsistencies in these data, which may be explained by possible differences in definition of time points for this outcome (downgraded to very low-certainty evidence); data were unclearly reported in one study. We found no evidence of a difference in length of hospital stay according to type of anaesthetic maintenance agent (mean difference (MD) 0 days, 95% CI -1.32 to 1.32; 175 participants; four studies; very low-certainty evidence).We used the GRADE approach to downgrade the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. Reasons for downgrading included: study limitations, because some included studies insufficiently reported randomization methods, had high attrition bias, or high risk of selective reporting bias; imprecision, because we found few studies; inconsistency, because we noted heterogeneity across studies. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS We are uncertain whether maintenance with propofol-based TIVA or with inhalational agents affect incidences of postoperative delirium, mortality, or length of hospital stay because certainty of the evidence was very low. We found low-certainty evidence that maintenance with propofol-based TIVA may reduce POCD. We were unable to perform meta-analysis for intraoperative hypotension or length of stay in the PACU because of heterogeneity between studies. We identified 11 ongoing studies from clinical trials register searches; inclusion of these studies in future review updates may provide more certainty for the review outcomes.","Miller, David; Lewis, Sharon R; Pritchard, Michael W; Schofield-Robinson, Oliver J; Shelton, Cliff L; Alderson, Phil; Smith, Andrew F",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,4,1

In 2020, the WHO estimated that 8 million people have died due to smoking. Furthermore, smoking tobacco is a well-known risk factor for various infectious pulmonary diseases. The question raised, whether smoking is facilitating SARS-CoV-2-infections and increases adverse outcomes of COVID-19. To answer these questions a narrative review was conducted, finally including 7 systematic reviews with meta-analyses published in January and February 2021. Tobacco smoking was associated with an increased COVID-19 disease severity (odds ratio range of active vs. never smokers 1.55-2.19 and former vs. never smokers 1.20-2.48) and an increased COVID-19 in-hospital mortality (odds ratio range of active vs. never smokers 1.35-1.51 and former vs. never smokers 1.26-2.58). Beside immediate pulmonary toxic effects through active smoking, the cumulative livelong tobacco exposition and subsequent tobacco-associated diseases seem to predominantly predict adverse outcomes in patients with COVID-19. Data regarding an increased risk of infection among smokers is conflicting. However, a large observational study from England with 2.4 million persons reported an association between tobacco smoking and typical symptoms of COVID-19. For e-cigarettes and vaping less data exist, but experimental and first clinical investigations also suggest an increased risk for adverse outcomes for their use and SARS-CoV-2 infections. Especially during the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic with limited therapeutic options it is particularly important to advise smokers of their increased risks for unfavourable COVID-19 outcomes. Evidence based support for smoking cessation should be offered. In Germany, the existing and well-established methods to support tobacco cessation need to be reimbursed by statutory health insurances.","Raspe, Matthias; Bals, Robert; Hering, Thomas; Pankow, Wulf; Rupp, Alexander; Rustler, Christa; Urlbauer, Matthias; Andreas, Stefan",Pneumologie,4,1

However, 15% of patients in the medical group still experienced a primary end point during a median follow-up of 32.7 months. OBJECTIVE To determine baseline features that were associated with a high rate of a primary end point in the medical arm of the SAMMPRIS Trial. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A post hoc analysis of patients in the medical arm only of the SAMMPRIS trial. Enrollment occurred between October 2008 and April 2013 and included 227 patients randomized to medical management alone. Baseline demographic features, vascular risk factors, qualifying event, brain imaging, and angiographic features were analyzed. Bivariate and multivariable proportional hazard regression modeling was performed to relate baseline features to the time until a primary end point. The post hoc analysis was conducted from November 2014 to June 2015. INTERVENTIONS The SAMMPRIS Trial compared stenting with aggressive medical management in patients with a stroke or transient ischemic attack attributed to 70% to 99% stenosis of a major intracranial artery. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was any of the following: stroke or death within 30 days of enrollment, ischemic stroke in the territory of the symptomatic intracranial artery beyond 30 days after enrollment, or any stroke or death within 30 days after stenting a patient in the medical group during follow-up. RESULTS A total of 227 patients were included in the study, 82 of whom were female, and the mean (SD) age was 59.5 (11.8) years. Being female (hazard ratio [HR], 1.9; 95% CI, 0.96-3.7), having diabetes mellitus (HR, 1.8; 95% CI, 0.9-3.5), not taking a statin at enrollment (HR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.2-5.7), stroke as the qualifying event (HR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.03-6.0), Rankin grade of 1 or greater (HR, 2.3; 95% CI, 0.9-5.5), old infarct in the territory of the stenotic artery (HR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.3-5.1), and greater than 80% stenosis (HR, 1.9; 95% CI, 0.9-3.7) were associated (P < .10) with higher risk on bivariate analysis. Factors that were significantly associated with a primary end point on multivariable analyses were old infarct in the territory (HR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.3-5.3; P = .006), stroke as the qualifying event (HR, 3.0; 95% CI, 1.1-7.7; P = .03), and no statin use at enrollment (HR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.1-5.2; P = .03). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Old infarct in the territory of the stenosis, new stroke presentation, and absence of statin use at enrollment were independently associated with high rates of the primary end point in the medical group in the SAMMPRIS Trial.

QUALITY OF EVIDENCE A narrative review of medications most widely used to treat COVID-19 was conducted, outlining the best available evidence for each pharmacologic treatment to date. Searches were performed in PubMed, EMBASE, and MEDLINE using key words COVID-19 and treatment, as well as related terms. Relevant research studies conducted in human populations and cases specific to patients with COVID-19 were included, as were relevant hand-searched papers and reviews. Only articles in English and Chinese were included. MAIN MESSAGE While current management of patients with COVID-19 largely involves supportive care, without a widely available vaccine, practitioners have also resorted to repurposing medications used for other indications. This has caused considerable controversy, as many of these treatments have limited clinical evidence supporting their use and therefore pose implications for patient safety, drug access, and public health. For instance, medications such as hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, lopinavir-ritonavir, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers gained widespread media attention owing to hype, misinformation, or misinterpretation of research evidence. CONCLUSION Given the severity of the pandemic and the potential broad effects of implementing safe and effective treatment, this article provides a narrative review of the current evidence behind the most widely used medications to treat COVID-19 in order to enable health care practitioners to make informed decisions in the care of patients with this life-threatening disease.","Ng, T S Brandon; Leblanc, Kori; Yeung, Darwin F; Tsang, Teresa S M",Canadian family physician Medecin de famille canadien,4,1

Understanding how the virus engages the immune system will facilitate the development of needed therapeutic strategies. In this study, we demonstrate both in vitro and in vivo that the SARS-CoV-2 surface proteins spike (S) and envelope (E) activate the key immune signaling IFN pathway in both human and mouse immune and epithelial cells independent of viral infection and replication. These proteins induce reactive oxidative species generation and increases in human- and murine-specific, IFN-responsive cytokines and chemokines, similar to their upregulation in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Induction of IFN signaling is dependent on canonical but discrepant inflammatory signaling mediators, as the activation induced by S is dependent on IRF3, TBK1, and MyD88, whereas that of E is largely MyD88 independent. Furthermore, these viral surface proteins, specifically E, induced peribronchial inflammation and pulmonary vasculitis in a mouse model. Finally, we show that the organized inflammatory infiltrates are dependent on type I IFN signaling, specifically in lung epithelial cells. These findings underscore the role of SARS-CoV-2 surface proteins, particularly the understudied E protein, in driving cell specific inflammation and their potential for therapeutic intervention.","Anand, Gautam; Perry, Alexandra M; Cummings, Celeste L; Raymond, Emma; Clemens, Regina A; Steed, Ashley L",Journal of immunology,4,1

This study describes the results of four whole-lake field campaigns carried out in Lake Como (north Italy) during thermal stratification. The aim was to analyze the distribution of chemical-biological variables in a multi-basin lake as a result of internal and external physical drivers and constrains. Lake Como has a y-like shape encompassing three main sub-basins: northern, south-eastern, and south-western. Field data underlined: the presence of chemical-biological gradients between the south-western basin and the rest of the lake and the propagation of a fresher water-plume (formed by the two main northern inflows) into the northern basin and then into the south-western closed arm. The use of a three-dimensional hydrodynamic model showed a periodic movement of this plume that tends to enter the south-western basin first and then to return toward north, moving forward and back through the junction of the three arms. The entrance into the eastern basin, instead, occurs only secondarily. Wavelet transform analysis revealed common periodicity between the plume movement and the action of different external and internal lake-stressors, including: the discharge of the main inflow (period centered at 1, 3.3, and 6.5 day), the wind intensity (0.5 and 1 day) and the two main basin-scale internal wave motions: (3.3 day and 7.1 day). The periodic movement of the fresher water-plume enhances the water exchange and reduces the chemical-biological gradients between the western closed basin and the main lake, playing a crucial role in distributing both inorganic and organic materials at the lake basin-scale.","Copetti, Diego; Guyennon, Nicolas; Buzzi, Fabio",The Science of the total environment,4,1

Tirofiban has been used for the treatment of thromboembolism of ruptured aneurysms with a stent. However, there are few comparative studies of a reasonable dosage for the prophylactic use of tirofiban. This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of reducing the dosage of tirofiban for the ruptured aneurysms with SAC. Patients with ruptured intracranial aneurysms in our institution from January 2014 to June 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. Three hundred and nine patients were treated using SAC within 72 h of onset. Patients were divided into either a standard group (211 patients, 10 μg/kg intravenous bolus within 3 min, maintained with 0.15 μg/kg/min) or a half-dose group (98 patients, 5 μg/kg intravenous bolus within 3 min, maintained with 0.075 μg/kg/min) according to the dose of tirofiban received intraoperatively. Medical records including clinical and radiological details were reviewed. No significant differences in demographic information or aneurysm characteristics existed between the two groups. Thromboembolic complications were found in 15 patients (4.9%), including 11 patients (5.2%) in the standard group and four patients (4.1%) in the half-dose group, without significant difference (P = 0.782). Intracranial hemorrhage was found in 13 patients (4.2%), and all occurred in the standard group, which was significantly different (6.2% vs 0%, P = 0.011). Of these 13 patients, four were left disabled and five died. Except for three patients who had intraoperative aneurysm rupture, the incidence of postoperative early rebleeding (10 patients) was significantly different between the two groups (4.7% vs 0%, P = 0.034). The rate of initial complete occlusion in the half-dose group was significantly higher than that in the standard group (55.1% vs 39.8%). The rate of a good outcome (modified Rankin Scale 0-2) was not significantly different between the standard group and half-dose group (78.7% vs 87.8%, P > 0.05). Intravenous tirofiban for SAC of acutely ruptured intracranial aneurysms is feasible and safe. The half-dose tirofiban treatment was associated with a decrease in the prevalence of intracranial hemorrhage but no increase in thromboembolic events compared with those in standard-dose tirofiban treatment.","Yan, Yazhou; He, Xiaowu; Fang, Yibin; Xu, Yi; Hong, Bo; Liu, Jianmin; Huang, Qinghai",Neurosurgical review,4,1

This limits prioritisation of investment and development of national stroke strategies. Methods National stroke representatives throughout Europe were surveyed. Consensus panels reported national data if available, or else expert opinion, estimating the availability of each intervention by quintiles of patients, dichotomised for analysis at 60%. Countries were classified into tertiles of gross domestic product per capita. Results Of 50 countries, 46 responded; 14/45 (31%) had national stroke registries and 25/46 (54.3%) had national stroke strategies incorporating secondary prevention. Respondents reported that the majority of TIA patients were assessed by specialist services within 48 hours in 74.4% of countries, but in nine countries more than 20% of patients were seen after more than seven days and usually assessed by non-specialists (7/46 countries). Eighty percent of countries deferred blood pressure assessment to primary care, whilst lifestyle management programmes were commonly available in only 46% of countries. Although basic interventions were widely available, interventions frequently not available to more than 60% of patients included: ambulatory cardiac monitoring (40% countries); prescription (26%) and continuation (46%) of statins; blood pressure control at follow-up (44%); carotid endarterectomy within one month (15%); face-to-face follow-up in hospital (33%); direct oral anticoagulants (21%). Gross domestic product per capita and reimbursement of interventions were the commonest predictors of availability of interventions. Conclusions Provision of secondary prevention varied, with gaps in care prevalent throughout Europe, particularly in lower income countries.","Webb, A; Heldner, M R; Aguiar de Sousa, D; Sandset, E C; Randall, G; Bejot, Y; van der Worp, B; Caso, V; Fischer, U",European stroke journal,4,12

However, internet searches are a complex and dynamic process that can be fraught with subtleties and potential error. The mechanics of searching for and using electronic health (eHealth) information is ostensibly cognitively demanding; yet we know little about the role of neurocognitive abilities in this regard. Fifty-six young adults completed two naturalistic eHealth search tasks: fact-finding (eHealth Fact) and symptom-diagnosis (eHealth Search). Participants also completed neurocognitive tests of attention, psychomotor speed, learning/memory, and executive functions. Shorter eHealth symptom-diagnosis search time was related to better executive functions, while better eHealth symptom-diagnosis search accuracy was related to better episodic and prospective memory. In contrast, neither eHealth Fact search time nor its accuracy were related to any of the neurocognitive measures. Our findings suggest a differential relationship between neurocognitive abilities and eHealth search behaviors among young adults such that higher-order abilities may be implicated in eHealth searches requiring greater synthesis of information. Future work should examine the cognitive architecture of eHealth search in persons with neurocognitive disorders, as well as that of other aspects of eHealth search behaviors (e.g., search term generation, website reliability, and decision-making).","Kordovski, Victoria M; Babicz, Michelle A; Ulrich, Nathalie; Woods, Steven Paul",Perceptual and motor skills,4,1

However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate the expansion of MMC9s remain unknown. OBJECTIVE We hypothesized that IL-4 regulates MMC9 development and MMC9-dependent experimental IgE-mediated food allergy. METHODS We utilized an epicutaneous sensitization-model and performed bone marrow (BM) reconstitution experiments, to test the requirement of IL-4Rα signaling on MMC9's in experimental IgE-mediated food allergy. Flow cytometric, bulk and single cell RNA-seq analysis on small intestine (SI)-MMC9s was performed to illuminate MMC9 transcriptional signature and the effect of IL-4Rα signaling on MMC9 function. BM-derived MMC9 culture system was used to define IL-4-BATF signaling in MMC9 development. RESULTS Epicutaneous sensitization and BM reconstitution based models of IgE-mediated food allergy revealed an IL-4 signaling-dependent cell-intrinsic effect on SI- MMC9 cell accumulation and food allergy severity. RNA-seq analysis of SI-MMC9 cells identified 410 gene transcripts reciprocally regulated by IL-4 signaling, including Il9 and Basic leucine zipper ATF-like transcription factor (Batf). In silico analyses identified a 3491-gene MMC9 transcriptional signature and identified two transcriptionally distinct SI-MMC9 populations enriched for metabolic or inflammatory programs. Employing an in vitro MMC9-culture model system we show that generation of MMC9-like cells was induced by IL-4 and this was in part dependent on BATF. CONCLUSION IL-4Rα signaling directly modulates MMC9 function and exacerbation of experimental IgE-mediated food allergic reactions. IL-4Rα regulation of MMC9s is in part BATF-dependent and via modulation of metabolic transcriptional programs.","Tomar, Sunil; Ganesan, Varsha; Sharma, Ankit; Zeng, Chang; Waggoner, Lisa; Smith, Andrew; Kim, Chang H; Licona-Limón, Paula; Reinhardt, Richard L; Flavell, Richard A; Wang, Yui-Hsi; Hogan, Simon P",The Journal of allergy and clinical immunology,4,5

METHODS A total of 329 outpatients were enrolled. In the first step, the patients underwent the Mini-Mental State Examination. After assessing whether the patients meet the diagnosis of depression based on DSM-5 diagnostic criteria, another researcher applied the long form of GDS. After sorting the items of short form out of the long form, two separate scores were obtained. The scores of GDS-30 and GDS-15 scales were compared with the scores of DSM-5. RESULTS The correlation of GDS-30 with GDS-15 was r=0.966 (p<0.001). The analysis performed considering DSM-5 criteria revealed that the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of GDS-15 in determining depression were 92%, 91%, 76%, and 97%, respectively, when the cutoff value was taken as ≥5. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve [95% confidence interval (CI)] was 0.97 (95% CI=0.947-0.996) for GDS-15 (p<0.001). The Cronbach alpha coefficient for the total scale was 0.920. CONCLUSION GDS-15, just as GDS-30, is a beneficial scale in determining depression in older adults. This study provides an evidence for the validity and reliability of GDS-15 in Turkish elderly population and primary care centers.","Durmaz, Busra; Soysal, Pinar; Ellidokuz, Hulya; Isik, Ahmet Turan",Northern clinics of Istanbul,4,1

However, coil protrusion occurs occasionally, and little is known about the frequency, the risk factors and the risk of thrombo-embolic complications. METHOD We assessed the frequency and the risk factors for coil protrusion in 330 unruptured aneurysm embolization cases, and examined the occurrence of cerebral infarction by diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI). RESULT Forty-four instances of coil protrusion were encountered during coil embolization (13.3% of cases), but incidence was reduced to 33 (10% of cases) by balloon press or insertion of the next coil. Coil protrusion occurred more frequently during the last phase of the procedure, and both a wide neck (large fundus to neck ratio) (OR = 1.84, P = 0.03) and an inadequately stable neck frame (OR = 5.49, P = 0.0007) increased protrusion risk. Coil protrusions did not increase the incidence of high-intensity lesions (infarcts) on DW-MRI (33.3% vs 29% of cases with no coil protrusion). However, longer operation time did increase infarct risk (P = 0.0003). Thus, tail or loop type coil protrusion did not increase the risk of thrombo-embolic complications, if adequate blood flow was maintained. CONCLUSION Coil protrusion tended to occur more frequently in cases of wide-neck aneurysms with loose neck framing. Moderate and less coil protrusion carries no additional thrombo-embolic risk, if blood flow is maintained, which can be aided by additional post-operative antiplatelet therapy.","Ishihara, Hideaki; Ishihara, Shoichiro; Niimi, Jun; Neki, Hiroaki; Kakehi, Yoshiaki; Uemiya, Nahoko; Kohyama, Shinya; Yamane, Fumitaka","Interventional neuroradiology : journal of peritherapeutic neuroradiology, surgical procedures and related neurosciences",4,1

In mice, deletion of STIM1 in all immune cells enhanced susceptibility to mucosal C. albicans infection, whereas T cell-specific deletion of STIM1 impaired immunity to systemic C. albicans infection. STIM1 deletion impaired the production of Th17 cytokines essential for antifungal immunity and compromised the expression of genes in several metabolic pathways including Foxo and HIF1α signaling that regulate glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS).

However, risk factors associated with asynchrony are not completely understood. The main objectives of this study are to estimate the incidence of asynchrony during invasive MV and its association with respiratory mechanics and other baseline patient characteristics. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We designed a prospective cohort study of patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of a university hospital. Inclusion criteria are adult patients under invasive MV initiated for less than 72 hours, and with expectation of remaining under MV for more than 24 hours. Exclusion criteria are high flow bronchopleural fistula, inability to measure respiratory mechanics and previous tracheostomy. Baseline assessment includes clinical characteristics of patients at ICU admission, including severity of illness, reason for initiation of MV, and measurement of static mechanics of the respiratory system. We will capture ventilator waveforms during the entire MV period that will be analysed with dedicated software (Better Care, Barcelona, Spain), which automatically identifies several types of asynchrony and calculates the asynchrony index (AI). We will use a linear regression model to identify risk factors associated with AI. To assess the relationship between survival and AI we will use Kaplan-Meier curves, log rank tests and Cox regression. The calculated sample size is 103 patients. The statistical analysis will be performed by the software R Programming (www.R-project.org) and will be considered statistically significant if the p value is less than 0.05.

We studied CDS with five features intended to increase effectiveness: (i) focus on serious DDIs, (ii) fewer notifications, (iii) presentation of current laboratory results, (iv) timing (when adverse event becomes likelier), (v) removal of notification when appropriate. METHODS We conducted a 1-year, hospital-wide, cluster-randomised controlled trial in the inpatient setting at a large tertiary-care academic medical centre. Three CDS types were implemented: monitoring reminders (unknown potassium, no monitoring ordered), elevated potassium warnings (≥4.9 mEq/l), and hyperkalaemia alerts (≥5.5 mEq/l). The primary endpoint was the frequency of potassium-monitoring intervals >72 h. RESULTS We analysed 15,272 and 18,981 stays with 2804 and 2057 potassium-increasing DDIs in the intervention and control groups, respectively. Patient-specific notifications: displayed were 869 reminders (1 per 3.2 potassium-increasing DDIs), 356 warnings (1:7.9), and 62 alerts (1:45.2). Nevertheless, insufficiently monitored DDIs were not reduced (intervention 451 of 9686 intervals >72 h [4.66%]; control 249 of 6140 [4.06%]). The only secondary outcome improved was the length of potassium monitoring intervals (intervention group mean 22.9 h, control 23.7 h; p <0.001). However, in the intervention group, during 50 of 2804 observed potassium-increasing DDI periods (1.78%) one or more serum potassium values ≥ 5.5mEq/l were measured, in the control group, during 27 of 2057 (1.31%; p = 0.20). CONCLUSIONS A highly patient-specific CDS feature combination had a negligible impact on the management of potentially serious potassium-increasing DDIs and was unable to improve safety among hospitalised patients.","Beeler, Patrick E; Eschmann, Emmanuel; Schneemann, Markus; Blaser, Jürg",Swiss medical weekly,4,16

The objective of this study is to evaluate, objectively, the tibiofemoral contact area and stress after single-bundle (SB) anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) with femoral tunnel positions drilled by transtibial (TT) or anteromedial (AM) portal techniques. METHODS Seven fresh human cadaveric knees underwent ACLR by the use of TT or AM portal techniques in a randomized order. These specimens were reused for ACL-R (TT and AM). The tibiofemoral contact area and stresses were gauged by an electronic stress-sensitive film inserted into the joint space. The knee was under the femoral axial compressive load of 1000 N using a biomechanics testing machine at 0°, 10°, 20°, and 30° of flexion. Three conditions were compared: (1) intact ACL, (2) ACLR by the use of the TT method, and (3) ACLR by the use of the AM portal method. RESULTS Compared with AM portal ACL-reconstructed knees, a significantly decreased tibiofemoral contact area on the medial compartment was detected in the TT ACL-reconstructed knees at 20°of knee flexion (P = .047). Compared with the intact group, the TT ACLR group showed a higher mean stress at 20° and 30° of flexion on the medial compartments (P = .001, P = .003, respectively), while the AM portal ACLR group showed no significant differences at 30° of flexion (P = .073). The TT ACLR group also showed a higher mean maximum stress at 20° of flexion on the medial compartments (P = .047), while the AM portal ACLR group showed no significant differences at this angle(P = .319). DISCUSSION The alternation of the tibiofemoral joint contact area and stress in reconstructed knees may be caused by the mismatch of the tibiofemoral joint during knee movement procedures compared with intact knees. CONCLUSIONS SB ACLR by the use of the AM portal method and TT method both alter the tibiofemoral contact area and stress when compared with the intact knee. When compared with the TT technique, ACLR by the AM portal technique more closely restores the intact tibiofemoral contact area and stress at low flexion angles.","Liu, Chunhui; Wang, Yingpeng; Li, Zhongli; Li, Ji; Zhang, Hao; Fu, Yangmu; Zhang, Kuan",Journal of orthopaedic surgery and research,4,29

This 12-year survey aims to evaluate several clinical, functional and immunological parameters in order to assess features, trend and burden of asthma, allergy, infections and autoimmune diseases, in a large homogeneous population of Olympic athletes. METHODS Six hundred and fifty-nine Italian Olympic athletes were studied through four cross-sectional surveys performed between 2000 and 2012 before the Summer and Winter Olympics. Clinical diagnosis of allergic, autoimmune and infectious diseases was complemented by: skin-prick tests (n = 569); pulmonary function tests (n = 415); total (n = 158) and specific (n = 72) serum IgE; serum autoantibodies (n = 30), cytokines and growth factors (n = 92); flow cytometry (n = 135). RESULTS The prevalence of asthma and/or exercise-induced bronchoconstriction was 14.7%, with a significant increase (P = 0.04) from 2000 (11.3%) to 2008 (17.2%). The prevalence of rhinitis, conjunctivitis, skin allergic diseases and anaphylaxis was 26.2%, 20.0%, 14.8% and 1.1%, respectively. Sensitization to inhalant allergens was documented in 49.0% of athletes, being 32.7% in 2000 and 56.5% in 2008 (P < 0.0001). Food, drug and venom allergy was present in 7.1%, 5.0% and 2.1% of athletes, respectively. The high prevalence of asthma and allergy was associated with recurrent upper respiratory tract (10.3%) and herpes (18.2%) infections, an abnormal T cell subset profile and a general down-regulation of serum cytokines with a significantly lower IFN-γ/IL-4 ratio. CONCLUSION A chronic and intense physical exercise may cause a transient immunodepression with a preferential shift to a Th2 response, associated with abnormalities of the respiratory tract.","Bonini, Matteo; Gramiccioni, Claudia; Fioretti, Daniela; Ruckert, Beate; Rinaldi, Monica; Akdis, Cezmi; Todaro, Antonio; Palange, Paolo; Carlsen, Kai-Hakon; Pelliccia, Antonio; Rasi, Guido; Bonini, Sergio",Current opinion in allergy and clinical immunology,4,12

METHOD A narrative review was conducted using MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO databases and the Cochrane Library to identify studies published in either English or Spanish from 2002 to 2018. RESULTS 47 studies were included, and five categories were identified: 1)""the need to know""; 2)family satisfaction with the information received; 3)impact of information on families' experiences in the ICU; 4)nurses and physicians' perceptions of information transmission, and 5)information process in the ICU. CONCLUSIONS Providing honest and truthful information to the families of critical patients is essential to reduce family anxiety and increase family control, although this often appears to be inadequately accomplished by staff. Interdisciplinary involvement in information giving may be beneficial for both families and ICU professionals. This review brings new understanding about the process of information to families of ICU patients and it can be used to improve the quality and humanization of care in the ICUs.","Regaira-Martínez, E; Garcia-Vivar, C",Enfermeria intensiva,4,1

The aims were to document the transition across diverse sites and present recommendations for future telehealth service planning. METHOD Consortium sites completed a Qualtrics survey assessing site characteristics, telehealth practices, service utilization, and barriers to and facilitators of telehealth service delivery prior to (pre) and during the early stages of (post) the COVID-19 pandemic. The design is descriptive. RESULTS All sites pivoted from in-person services to home-based telehealth within two weeks. Some sites experienced delays in conducting new intakes and most experienced delays establishing tele-group therapy. No-show rates and utilization of telephony versus videoconferencing varied by site. Changes in telehealth practices (e.g., documentation requirements, safety protocols) and perceived barriers to telehealth service delivery (e.g., regulatory limitations, inability to bill) occurred pre/post-COVID-19. CONCLUSION A rapid pivot from in-person services to home-based telehealth occurred at eight diverse academic programs in the context of a global crisis. To promote ongoing use of home-based telehealth during future crises and usual care, academic programs should continue documenting the successes and barriers to telehealth practice to promote equitable and sustainable telehealth service delivery in the future.","Folk, Johanna B; Schiel, Marissa A; Oblath, Rachel; Feuer, Vera; Sharma, Aditi; Khan, Shabana; Doan, Bridget; Kulkarni, Chetana; Ramtekkar, Ujjwal; Hawks, Jessica; Fornari, Victor; Fortuna, Lisa R; Myers, Kathleen",Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry,4,5

METHODS This was an observational case series, Canadian Task Force Classification II-3 conducted at an academic and community teaching hospital. A total of 654 patients underwent robotic-assisted total laparoscopic hysterectomy for both malignant and benign reasons from September 1, 2006 to March 1, 2011 performed by a single surgeon. The da Vinci Surgical System was used for robotic-assisted total laparoscopic hysterectomy. RESULTS There were 3 cases of vaginal cuff dehiscence among 654 robotic-assisted total laparoscopic hysterectomies, making our cumulative incidence of vaginal cuff dehiscence 0.4%. The mean time between the procedures and vaginal cuff dehiscence was 44.3 d (6.3 wk). All patients were followed up twice after surgery, at 3 to 4 wk and 12 to 16 wk. CONCLUSION In our study, the incidence of vaginal cuff dehiscence after robotic-assisted total laparoscopic hysterectomy compares favorably to that of total abdominal and vaginal hysterectomy. Our study suggests that the incidence of vaginal cuff dehiscence is more likely related to the technique of colpotomy and vaginal cuff suturing than to robotic assisted total hysterectomy per se. With proper technique and patient education, our vaginal dehiscence rate has been 0.4%, which is 2.5 to 10 times less than the previously reported vaginal cuff dehiscence rate in the literature.","Kashani, Shabnam; Gallo, Taryn; Sargent, Anita; Elsahwi, Karim; Silasi, Dan-Arin; Azodi, Masoud",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,4,1

A refinement of this technique is autologous blood withdrawal with the sequestration of platelet rich plasma (PRP) and red blood cells (RBCs). METHODS One hundred and four patients were included in a randomized study stratified into three groups: the autologous blood withdrawal group (Group 1), the autologous blood withdrawal group with blood loss sequestration (Group 2) and the control group (Control group). In Group 1, the amount of withdrawn blood was transfused after CPB. In Group 2, the RBCs were transfused immediately after sequestration and the PRP was transfused after the termination of CPB. In the Control group, no autologous blood withdrawal was employed. The following variables were analysed: blood loss, blood products transfusion, fluid transfusion, diuresis, haematological and coagulation data and the duration of the operation and intensive care unit stay. RESULTS We found no significant differences in peri-operative blood loss and transfused blood products among the three groups. There was a trend towards a lower amount of transfused fresh frozen plasma (FFP) for Group 1 (p =0.057) in the operation room (OR). The use of plasma expanders post-CPB was significantly higher in the Control group (p=0.024). RBCs coming from the auto-transfusion device were, for Group 1, significantly lower (p=0.007). The Hb and Hct values in Group 1, at start and end of CPB, were significantly lower (p=0.023-0.003 / 0.001-0.001, respectively). All other parameters were not significantly different. CONCLUSION there were no significant differences between the study groups. This randomized trial shows that, although sequestration immediately after autologous blood withdrawal has no added value, autologous blood withdrawal in patients with a normal pre-operative Hb and Hct is simple, inexpensive and allows for autologous blood transfusion.","van der Wal, M T; Boks, R H; Wijers-Hille, M J; Hofland, J; Takkenberg, J J M; Bogers, A J J C",Perfusion,4,16

Although extensive attention has been paid to the role of altered cerebrovascular hemodynamics using computational fluid dynamics analyses, relatively less emphasis has been placed on the role of the vascular endothelium in promoting aneurysm healing. PURPOSE Our aim was to systematically review all available literature investigating the mechanism of action of flow diverters in both human patients and preclinical models. DATA SOURCES A systematic search of PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Web of Science electronic data bases was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. STUDY SELECTION We selected articles assessing the role of endothelialization in flow-diverter treatment of cerebral aneurysms, including both preclinical and clinical studies. DATA ANALYSIS Ten articles were eligible for inclusion in this review. Two assessed endothelialization in human patients, while the other 8 used preclinical models (either rabbits or pigs). DATA SYNTHESIS Methods used to assess endothelialization included optical coherence tomography and scanning electron microscopy. LIMITATIONS A limitation was the heterogeneity of studies. CONCLUSIONS Current data regarding the temporal relationship to flow-diverter placement has largely been derived from work in preclinical animal models. Whether these cells along the device struts originate from adjacent endothelial cells or are the result of homing of circulating endothelial progenitor cells is equivocal.","Ravindran, K; Salem, M M; Alturki, A Y; Thomas, A J; Ogilvy, C S; Moore, J M",AJNR.

Mismanagement of personal protective equipment (PPE) during COVID-19 pandemic, with a monthly estimated use of 129 billion face masks and 65 billion gloves globally, is resulting in widespread environmental contamination. This poses a risk to public health as a vector for SARS-CoV-2 virus, which survives up to 3 days on plastics, as well as impacts to ecosystems and organisms more broadly functions. Concerns over the role of reusable plastics as vectors for SARS-CoV-2 virus contributed to the reversal of bans on single-use plastics, highly supported by the plastic industry. While not underestimating the importance of plastics in the prevention of COVID-19 transmission, it is imperative not to undermine recent progress made in the sustainable use of plastics. There is a need to assess alternatives that allow reductions of PPE and reinforce awareness on the proper public use and disposal. Finally, assessment of contamination and impacts of plastics driven by the pandemic will be required once the outbreak ends.","Prata, Joana Correia; Patrício Silva, Ana Luísa; Walker, Tony R; Duarte, Armando C; Rocha Santos, Teresa",Environmental science & technology,4,16

Considering the demerits of a high-definition 2-dimensional (HD-2D) system, with its lack of stereopsis, and a conventional 3-dimensional (C-3D) system, which results in a dimmed image, we have recently developed a glasses-free 3-dimensional (GF-3D) display system for reconstruction surgeries such as video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) for tracheal reconstruction. Methods. Thoracic surgeons were invited to complete thoracoscopic continuous suture of a transected porcine trachea using the HD-2D, C-3D, and GF-3D systems on separate mornings in randomized order. The duration, numbers of stitches, and distance between every 2 stitches were recorded for every procedure. The surgeons' spontaneous eye blink rate was recorded for 5 minutes before the procedure and the last 5 minutes of the procedure. Results. Fifteen volunteers successfully completed the tracheal reconstruction procedures in this study. Both C-3D (0.403 ± 0.064 stitch/min, P < .001) and GF-3D (0.427 ± 0.079 stitch/min, P < .001) showed significant advantages in speed compared with HD-2D (0.289 ± 0.065 stitch/min). Both C-3D (2.536 ± 2.223 mm, P < .001) and GF-3D (2.603 ± 2.159 mm, P < .001) showed significant advantages in accuracy compared with HD-2D (3.473 ± 3.403 mm). Both HD-2D (1.240 ± 0.642, P < .001) and GF-3D (1.307 ± 0.894, P < .001) showed significant advantages in eye fatigue compared with C-3D (3.333 ± 1.44). Conclusions. All 3 available display systems are efficient for complex VATS. With the help of stereopsis, surgeons can achieve faster operation using C-3D and GF-3D systems in a thoracoscopic simulated setting. GF-3D may be a more effective display system for VATS reconstruction in terms of speed, accuracy, and eye fatigue during operations.","Liu, Jun; Li, Jingpei; Liang, Hengrui; Cui, Fei; Wang, Wei; Huang, Jun; Peng, Guilin; Huang, Weizhe; Wang, Yidong; He, Kaiming; Pan, Qi; He, Jianxing",Surgical innovation,4,8

The final sample consisted of 65 patients with mild PD progression. Based on neuropsychological measures, our sample was categorized into three PD-MCI subtypes: (1) PD-MCI executive group (n = 24), (2) PD-MCI executive plus memory group (n = 22), and (3) PD-MCI executive plus visuospatial group (n = 19). Patients' executive functions were evaluated with the Trail Making Test-Part B (TMT-B) and Stroop Neuropsychological Screening Test (SNST) for mental flexibility and inhibitory control, respectively. One-way ANOVA results indicated significant differences among the three subgroups on TMT-B and SNST performance. Post hoc Tukey honestly significant different (HSD) tests revealed that the PD-MCI executive plus visuospatial group had lower performances on both executive measures than the other two groups. Contrastingly, no significant differences were observed between the PD-MCI executive group and PD-MCI executive plus memory group. Our results indicated that the severity of executive dysfunction varies across different PD-MCI subtypes. These findings are discussed within the framework of the dual syndrome hypothesis and highlight the utility of determination of executive impairment severity for effective clinical management of patients with PD.","Kormas, Constantinos; Zalonis, Ioannis; Evdokimidis, Ioannis; Kapaki, Elisabeth; Potagas, Constantin",Applied neuropsychology.

One proposal is use of a single ventilator to support 4 patients. METHODS A ventilator was modified to allow attachment of 4 circuits. Each circuit was connected to one chamber of 2 dual-chambered, test lungs. The ventilator was set at a tidal volume (V(T)) of 2.0 L, respiratory frequency of 10 breaths/min, and PEEP of 5 cm H(2)O. Tests were repeated with pressure targeted breaths at 15 cm H(2)O. Airway pressure, volume, and flow were measured at each chamber. The test lungs were set to simulate 4 patients using combinations of resistance (R) and compliance (C). These included equivalent C and R, constant R and variable C, constant C and variable R, and variable C and variable R. RESULTS When R and C were equivalent the V(T) distributed to each chamber of the test lung was similar during both volume (range 428-442 mL) and pressure (range 528-544 mL) breaths. Changing C while R was constant resulted in large variations in delivered V(T) (volume range 257-621 mL, pressure range 320-762 mL). Changing R while C was constant resulted in a smaller variation in V(T) (volume range 418-460 mL, pressure range 502-554 mL) compared to only C changes. When R and C were both varied, the range of delivered V(T) in both volume (336-517 mL) and pressure (417-676 mL) breaths was greater, compared to only R changes. CONCLUSIONS Using a single ventilator to support 4 patients is an attractive concept; however, the V(T) cannot be controlled for each subject and V(T) disparity is proportional to the variability in compliance. Along with other practical limitations, these findings cannot support the use of this concept for mass-casualty respiratory failure.","Branson, Richard D; Blakeman, Thomas C; Robinson, Bryce Rh; Johannigman, Jay A",Respiratory care,4,27

104355,104355,104355,Symbiotic Origin of Apoptosis.,11.742369,7.871547,2020,"BACKGROUND Abdominal surgery sometimes necessitates creating a stoma, which can cause future complications including parastomal hernia (PSH), an incisional hernia, adjacent and related to the stoma. PSH affects approximately 40% of patients within two years of stoma formation. Complications of PSH reduce patients' quality of life and can be severe, e.g. bowel obstruction. PSH are difficult to manage and can recur after surgical repair. Therefore, it is very important to prevent a PSH. Surgeons create stomas in different ways and both patient and surgical factors are believed to influence the development of PSH. The CIPHER study has been designed to investigate the influence of different surgical techniques on PSH development. METHOD The CIPHER study aims to recruit 4000 patients undergoing elective or expedited surgery with the intention to form an ileostomy or colostomy, irrespective of the primary indication for the planned surgery. For each patient, surgeons describe their methods of trephine formation, mesh reinforcement of the stoma trephine, use of the stoma as specimen extraction site and closure of wounds. The primary outcome is incident PSH during follow-up defined as symptoms of PSH (custom-designed questionnaire) and anatomical PSH, ascertained by independent reading of usual care CT scans. Secondary outcomes include; surgical site infection, Comprehensive Complication Index, quality of life (EQ-5D-5L and SF-12), PSH repair and use of NHS resources. DISCUSSION The CIPHER study is the first to investigate detailed surgical methods of stoma formation, in a large, representative cohort of patients with range of primary indications, both cancer and non-cancer.","Tabusa, H; Blazeby, J M; Blencowe, N; Callaway, M; Daniels, I R; Gunning, A; Hollingworth, W; McNair, A; Murkin, C; Pinkney, T D; Rogers, C A; Smart, N; Reeves, B C",Colorectal disease : the official journal of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland,4,1

Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is a person-specific source that is used as a therapeutic adjunct for the treatment of cartilage damage because it offers a cocktail of growth factors that are necessary for wound healing and tissue regeneration. However, PRP treatments in the clinic are not satisfactory and require upgrading, especially the point of maintaining bioactivity. In this study, we presented PRP as a photo-activated and photo-crosslinkable bio-ink in terms of tissue-specific structures for the first time. We achieved long-term and constant rate growth factor release and bioactivity protection of PRP with satisfactory mechanical characteristics. Photo-crosslinked PRP hydrogel was enabled by the addition of microwave-induced methacrylated gelatin (Gel-MA), which is connected to platelets in PRP via integrin receptors in its structure and chemically cross-linked upon UV irradiation (300-500 nm). Photo-activation of PRP was realized by a polychromatic light source in the near-infrared region (PAC, 600-1200 nm).

The objective of this study was to assess the interactions between MBL and severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) spike (S) glycoprotein (SARS-S). MBL was found to selectively bind to retroviral particles pseudotyped with SARS-S. Unlike several other viral envelopes to which MBL can bind, both recombinant and plasma-derived human MBL directly inhibited SARS-S-mediated viral infection. Moreover, the interaction between MBL and SARS-S blocked viral binding to the C-type lectin, DC-SIGN. Mutagenesis indicated that a single N-linked glycosylation site, N330, was critical for the specific interactions between MBL and SARS-S. Despite the proximity of N330 to the receptor-binding motif of SARS-S, MBL did not affect interactions with the ACE2 receptor or cathepsin L-mediated activation of SARS-S-driven membrane fusion. Thus, binding of MBL to SARS-S may interfere with other early pre- or postreceptor-binding events necessary for efficient viral entry.","Zhou, Yanchen; Lu, Kai; Pfefferle, Susanne; Bertram, Stephanie; Glowacka, Ilona; Drosten, Christian; Pöhlmann, Stefan; Simmons, Graham",Journal of virology,4,1

A realistic and sustainable diet plan can help us to have a healthy eating habit since it considers most of the expectations from a diet without any restriction. In this study, the classical diet problem has been extended in terms of modelling, data sets and solution approach. Inspired by animals' hunting strategies, it was re-modelled as a many-objective optimisation problem. In order to have realistic and applicable diet plans, cooked dishes are used. A well-known many-objective evolutionary algorithm is used to solve the diet problem. Results show that our approach can optimise specialised daily menus for different user types, depending on their preferences, age, gender and body index.

The incidence of chronic pain, post-operative complications, patient satisfaction and hernia recurrence at follow-up after 12 months was evaluated. METHODS Data were collected retrospectively from patient files and were analyzed for 169 male and female patients with 220 primary inguinal hernias. All patients included had undergone surgical repair for inguinal hernia by the laparoscopic transabdominal preperitoneal approach using Parietex ProGrip™ meshes performed in the same clinical center in Germany. Pre-, per- and post-operative data were collected, and a follow-up after 12 months was performed prospectively. Complications, pain scored on a 0-10 numeric rating scale (NRS), patient satisfaction and hernia recurrence were assessed. RESULTS The only complications were minor and were post-operative: hematoma/seroma (3 cases), secondary hemorrhage through the trocar's site (2 cases), hematuria, emphysema in the inguinal regions (both sides) and swelling above the genital organs (1 case for each). At mean follow-up at 22.8 months, there were only 3 reports of hernia recurrence: 1.4 % of the hernias. Most patients (95.9 %) were satisfied or very satisfied with their hernia repair with only 1.2 % reporting severe pain (NRS score 7-10) and 3.6 % reported mild pain. CONCLUSION This study demonstrates that in experienced hands, inguinal hernia repair surgery performed by laparoscopic transabdominal preperitoneal hernioplasty using Parietex ProGrip™ self-gripping meshes is rapid, efficient and safe with low pain and low hernia recurrence rate.","Birk, D; Hess, S; Garcia-Pardo, C",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,4,16

However, nutritional status, along with other factors, is decisive in the evolution of patients with other infectious diseases. The nutritional status of individuals is considered an indicator of health status. Furthermore, optimal nutritional status transcends the individual, and poor diet in a population can be considered a group risk factor. Evidence exists on the influence that diet has on the immune system and susceptibility to disease. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the nutritional status of patients older than 65 years who were admitted due to COVID-19 and how this has influenced the evolution of patients. DESIGN This prospective and observational study was performed in patients with COVID-19 infection confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Data were collected from the first 24 hours of admission. All patients admitted during one month to the wards assigned to COVID-19 infection were included. RESULTS A total of 83 patients were studied. The statistical study of mortality showed associations with age (p = 0.005), living in a nursing home (p = 0.022), a high Charlson Comorbidity Index (p = 0.039), hypertension (p = 0.032), comorbidities of dementia (p = 0.019) and cerebral vascular disease (p = 0.041), and Barthel Index (p = 0010). The analysis of the influence of the nutritional state on mortality revealed a statistical association between malnutrition and mortality in the pooled data analysis (p = 0.005) and analysis by degrees of malnutrition (p = 0.27). CONCLUSIONS Malnutrition was a risk factor as powerful as others such as hypertension, age, and different comorbidities. We must evaluate and treat the nutritional status of elderly patients with COVID-19 infection since it directly affects their evolution.","Abadía Otero, Jessica; Briongos Figuero, Laisa Socorro; Gabella Mattín, Miriam; Martín Usategui, Iciar; Cubero Morais, Pablo; Cuellar Olmedo, Luis; Inglada Galiana, Luis; Dueñas Gutiérrez, Carlos; Carretero Gómez, Juana; Corral Gudino, Luis; Miramontes González, José Pablo",Current medical research and opinion,4,5

Recently, post-COVID-19 lung disease is emerging with large numbers of patients left with chronic lung conditions. Considering the antifibrotic activity of the combination PY-CE, we also tested this supplementary management in post-COVID-19 lung patients. RESULTS 19 subjects with idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (IIP) were included in the study. High Resolution CT scans at inclusion confirmed the presence of lung fibrosis: 10 patients were treated with the Pycnogenol® Centellicum® combination and 9 subjects with standard management (SM) served as controls. Oxidative stress that was very high in all subjects at inclusion, decreased significantly in the supplement group (p<0.05). The Karnofsky performance scale index significantly improved in the supplement group in comparison with controls (p<0.05). The symptoms (fatigue, muscular pain, dyspnea) were significantly lower after 8 months in supplemented patients (p<0.05) as compared with controls. At the end of the study, the small cystic lesions (honeycombing) and traction bronchiectasis were stable or in partial regression in 4 subjects in the supplemented group (vs none in the control group) with a significant improvement in tissue edema in the supplemented subjects. On ultrasound lung scans the white (more echogenic) fibrotic component at inclusion was 18.5±2.2% in the images in controls vs 19.4±2.7% in the supplement group. At the end of the study, there was no improvement in controls (18.9±2.5%) vs a significant improvement in supplemented subjects (16.2±2.1%; p<0.05). In addition, 18 subjects with post-COVID-19 lung disease were included in the study; 10 patients were treated with the Pycnogenol® Centellicum® combination and evaluated after 4 weeks; 8 patients served as controls. Preliminary results show that symptoms associated with post-COVID-19 lung disease after 4 weeks were significantly improved with the supplement combination (p<0.05). Oxidative stress and the Karnofsky performance scale index scale were significantly improved in the supplements group as compared with controls (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS According to these observations, Pycnogenol® controls and decreases edema in several conditions and Centellicum® - modulating the apposition of collagen - modulates the development of irregular cicatrization, keloidal scarring and fibrosis. More time is needed to evaluate this effect in a larger number of post-COVID-19 patients with lung disease. This disease has affected millions of subjects worldwide, leaving severe consequences. Pycnogenol® and Centellicum® may improve the residual clinical picture in post-COVID-19 lung disease (PCL) patients and may reduce the number of subjects evolving into lung fibrosis. The evolution from edema to fibrosis seems to be slower or attenuated with this supplement combination both in Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and in PCL patients.","Cesarone, Maria R; Hu, Shu; Belcaro, Gianni; Cornelli, Umberto; Feragalli, Beatrice; Corsi, Marcello; Bombardelli, Ezio; Cotellese, Roberto; Hosoi, Morio; Rosenkvist, Lars",Minerva medica,4,20

As both pro- and anti-inflammatory roles for IL-22 have been described in studies using animal models of RA, its exact function in arthritis remains poorly defined. With this study we aimed to further unravel the mechanism by which IL-22 exerts its effects and to decipher its therapeutic potential by overexpression of IL-22 either locally or systemically during experimental arthritis. METHODS CIA was induced in DBA-1 mice by immunization and booster injection with type II collagen (col II). Before arthritis onset, IL-22 was overexpressed either locally by intra-articular injection or systemically by i.v. injection using an adenoviral vector and clinical arthritis was scored for a period of 10 days. Subsequently, joints were isolated for histological analysis of arthritis severity and mRNA and protein expression of various inflammatory mediators was determined in the synovium, spleen and serum. RESULTS Local IL-22 overexpression did not alter arthritis pathology, whereas systemic overexpression of IL-22 potently reduced disease incidence, severity and pathology during CIA. Mice systemically overexpressing IL-22 showed strongly reduced serum cytokine levels of TNF-α and macrophage inflammatory protein 1α that correlated significantly with the enhanced expression of the negative immune regulator SOCS3 in the spleen. CONCLUSION With this study, we revealed clear anti-inflammatory effects of systemic IL-22 overexpression during CIA. Additionally, we are the first to show that the protective effect of systemic IL-22 during experimental arthritis is likely orchestrated via upregulation of the negative regulator SOCS3.","Aarts, Joyce; Roeleveld, Debbie M; Helsen, Monique M; Walgreen, Birgitte; Vitters, Elly L; Kolls, Jay; van de Loo, Fons A; van Lent, Peter L; van der Kraan, Peter M; Koenders, Marije I",Rheumatology,4,1

However, V-V ECMO is a new technology compared to veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and cardiopulmonary bypass, and there are few reports of basic research. Although continuing research is desired, clinical research that standardizes conditions such as patients' background characteristics is difficult. The purpose of this study was to establish a simple and stably maintainable miniature V-V ECMO model to study the mechanisms of the biological reactions in circulation during V-V ECMO. The V-V ECMO system consisted of an original miniature membrane oxygenator, polyvinyl chloride tubing line, and roller pump. The priming volume of this system was only 8 mL. Polyethylene tubing was used to cannulate the right femoral vein as the venous return cannula for the V-V ECMO system. A 16-G cannula was passed through the right internal jugular vein and advanced into the right atrium as the conduit for venous uptake. The animals were divided into 2 groups: SHAM group and V-V ECMO group. V-V ECMO was initiated and maintained at 50-60 mL/kg/min, and oxygen was added into the oxygenator during V-V ECMO at a concentration of 100% (pump flow:oxygen = 1:10). Blood pressure was measured continuously, and blood cells were measured by blood collection. During V-V ECMO, the blood pressure and hemodilution rate were maintained around 80 mmHg and 20%, respectively. Hb was kept at >10 g/dL, and V-V ECMO could be maintained without blood transfusion. It was possible to confirm oxygenation of and carbon dioxide removal from the blood. Likewise, the pH was adequately maintained. There were no problems with this miniature V-V ECMO system, and extracorporeal circulation progressed safely. In this study, a novel miniature V-V ECMO model was established in the rat. A miniature V-V ECMO model appears to be very useful for studying the mechanisms of the biological reactions during V-V ECMO and to perform basic studies of circulation assist devices.","Fujii, Yutaka; Sumikura, Hirohito; Nagahama, Daisuke",Artificial organs,4,30

In Poland, enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for FD is offered by the National Health Fund only at selected hospital infusion centers. Patients with FB are considered at a high risk of developing complications from COVID-19. Some patients omitted infusions due to fear of infection or outbreaks in hospitals. Lack of alternative infusion sites hampered the situation. OBJECTIVES To analyze the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on FD patients, especially their fears and expectations, the Polish FD Collaborative Group collaborated on a survey project. MATERIAL AND METHODS Between September and November 2020, we distributed a customized survey exploring expectations and fears among FD subjects. RESULTS Fifty-five individuals (35 receiving ongoing ERT) from different FD centers completed the study. The median age was 40 years [IQR 25; 50], and gender distribution was almost equal (27 F; 28 M). One-fourth of FD patients reported severe disability limiting transportation for infusions that, in the opinion of the other 25% of responders, consumed >4 h. Forty-four (80%) of all would prefer home infusions performed by a nurse (n = 37, 67.3%) or by a trained non-medical person (n = 7, 12.7%), while 8 (14.5%) patients would choose a local hospital. As expected, transportation time (in one direction) was longer in those preferring home infusions (89.4 ±63 vs 36.2 ±67 min; p = 0.02). Also, those with more severe FD manifestation would prefer home infusions to treatment in FD centers (p = 0.03). The vast majority of respondents (n = 46; 83%) would not change their preferences after pandemic termination. CONCLUSIONS To maintain ERT, FD patients prefer home infusions or those given in the nearest hospital, especially during a pandemic.","Kusztal, Mariusz; Kłopotowski, Mariusz; Bazan-Socha, Stanisława; Błażejewska-Hyżorek, Beata; Pawlaczyk, Krzysztof; Oko, Andrzej; Krajewska, Magdalena; Nowicki, Michał",Advances in clinical and experimental medicine : official organ Wroclaw Medical University,4,1

Constant ER turnover and modulation is needed to meet different cellular requirements and autophagy has an important role in this process. However, its underlying regulatory mechanisms remain unexplained. Here we show that members of the FAM134 reticulon protein family are ER-resident receptors that bind to autophagy modifiers LC3 and GABARAP, and facilitate ER degradation by autophagy ('ER-phagy'). Downregulation of FAM134B protein in human cells causes an expansion of the ER, while FAM134B overexpression results in ER fragmentation and lysosomal degradation. Mutant FAM134B proteins that cause sensory neuropathy in humans are unable to act as ER-phagy receptors. Consistently, disruption of Fam134b in mice causes expansion of the ER, inhibits ER turnover, sensitizes cells to stress-induced apoptotic cell death and leads to degeneration of sensory neurons. Therefore, selective ER-phagy via FAM134 proteins is indispensable for mammalian cell homeostasis and controls ER morphology and turnover in mice and humans.","Khaminets, Aliaksandr; Heinrich, Theresa; Mari, Muriel; Grumati, Paolo; Huebner, Antje K; Akutsu, Masato; Liebmann, Lutz; Stolz, Alexandra; Nietzsche, Sandor; Koch, Nicole; Mauthe, Mario; Katona, Istvan; Qualmann, Britta; Weis, Joachim; Reggiori, Fulvio; Kurth, Ingo; Hübner, Christian A; Dikic, Ivan",Nature,4,33

We reviewed patients who underwent IUT for alloimmunization at a single fetal treatment center between 2015 and 2020. This ""IUT cohort"" was compared to an ""Alloimmunization cohort"": patients seen at our institution with a diagnosis of alloimmunization during pregnancy, who did not receive IUT. We collected maternal demographics including self-identified race/ethnicity and primary language, transfusion, and antibody characteristics. The cohorts were compared using unpaired t-tests, Mann-Whitney tests, and Fischer's exact tests, as appropriate. The IUT cohort included 43 patients and the alloimmunization cohort included 1049 patients. Compared to the alloimmunization cohort, there were significantly more patients of Latina descent in the IUT cohort (23.3% vs. 3.4%, p < .0001), and more non-English speakers (18.6% vs. 4.6%, p = .001). Twenty-one percent (9/43) of patients had immigrated to the United States, all of whom had pregnancies or miscarriages in their country of origin. A third of patients had new antibodies identified on serial screens during the current pregnancy. Significantly more women of Latina ethnicity and non-English speakers required IUTs compared to the cohort of women with alloimmunization. Insufficient access to care prior to arriving in the United States and among racial and ethnic minorities in the United States may contribute to these findings.

This study aimed to assess the impact of the pandemic on psychological distress and identify vulnerable groups using longitudinal data to account for pre-pandemic mental health status. Clinically significant psychological distress was assessed with the Kessler-6 in a national probability sample of adults in the United States at two time points, February 2019 (T1) and May 2020 (T2). To identify increases in distress, psychological distress during the worst month of the past year at T1 was compared with psychological distress over the past 30-days at T2. Survey adjusted logistic regression was used to estimate associations of demographic characteristics at T1 (gender, age, race, and income) and census region at T2 with within-person increases in psychological distress. The past-month prevalence of serious psychological distress at T2 was as high as the past-year prevalence at T1 (10.9% vs. 10.2%). Psychological distress was strongly associated across assessments (X2(4) = 174.6, p < .0001). Increase in psychological distress above T1 was associated with gender, age, household income, and census region. Equal numbers of people experienced serious psychological distress in 30-days during the pandemic as did over an entire year prior to the pandemic. Mental health services and research efforts should be targeted to those with a history of mental health conditions and groups identified as at high risk for increases in distress above pre-pandemic levels.","Breslau, Joshua; Finucane, Melissa L; Locker, Alicia R; Baird, Matthew; Roth, Elizabeth; Collins, Rebecca L",Preventive medicine,4,16

Numerous studies have shown a consistent improvement in patient-reported outcomes, but high failure rates have been reported by some studies. The typical patients undergoing MAT often have multiple other pathologies that require treatment at the time of surgery. The factors that predict failure of a meniscal allograft within this complex patient group are not clearly defined. PURPOSE To determine predictors of MAT failure in a large series to refine the indications for surgery and better inform future patients. STUDY DESIGN Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. METHODS All patients undergoing MAT at a single institution between May 2005 and May 2014 with a minimum of 1-year follow-up were prospectively evaluated and included in this study. Failure was defined as removal of the allograft, revision transplantation, or conversion to a joint replacement. Patients were grouped according to the articular cartilage status at the time of the index surgery: group 1, intact or partial-thickness chondral loss; group 2, full-thickness chondral loss 1 condyle; and group 3, full-thickness chondral loss both condyles. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to determine significant predictors of failure, independently of other factors. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were produced for overall survival and significant predictors of failure in the Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS There were 125 consecutive MATs performed, with 1 patient lost to follow-up. The median follow-up was 3 years (range, 1-10 years). The 5-year graft survival for the entire cohort was 82% (group 1, 97%; group 2, 82%; group 3, 62%). The probability of failure in group 1 was 85% lower (95% CI, 13%-97%) than in group 3 at any time. The probability of failure with lateral allografts was 76% lower (95% CI, 16%-89%) than medial allografts at any time. CONCLUSION This study showed that the presence of severe cartilage damage at the time of MAT and medial allografts were significantly predictive of failure. Surgeons and patients should use this information when considering the risks and benefits of surgery.","Parkinson, Ben; Smith, Nicholas; Asplin, Laura; Thompson, Peter; Spalding, Tim",Orthopaedic journal of sports medicine,4,20

The nonresectional dynamic mitral valve repair (NVR) method involves a complete flexible ring and artificial chordal insertion but without leaflet resection or annular plication. The aim of this study was to compare changes in mitral annular structure and function after the NVR technique with those after a resectional mitral valve repair (RVR) method, which involves leaflet resection and annuloplasty with a partial flexible ring. METHODS Patients with organic severe MR undergoing mitral valve repair with either technique underwent three-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography before and after surgery. The mitral annulus was tracked offline and measured throughout the cardiac cycle. Mitral leaflet mobility was also measured. RESULTS Fifteen patients underwent repair with NVR, and 13 underwent repair with RVR (age, 56 vs 61 years, respectively). Both operations reduced mitral annular area significantly (maximum area reduction, from 18.5 ± 4.6 to 6.6 ± 1.7 cm(2) and from 20.1 ± 4.8 to 6 ± 1.5 cm(2) with the NVR and RVR techniques, respectively; P < .001). In contrast to RVR, patients who underwent NVR maintained dynamic changes in mitral annular area, circumference, and anterior-posterior diameter during the cardiac cycle. Mitral leaflet mobility was reduced with both techniques, but posterior leaflet mobility was restricted with RVR. CONCLUSIONS The size of the mitral annulus is reduced after repair with either surgical approach. Compared with resectional valve repair, more dynamic changes in the structure of the mitral annulus are maintained during the cardiac cycle with the NVR technique early postoperatively, along with more preserved motion of the posterior leaflet.","Ben Zekry, Sagit; Lang, Roberto M; Sugeng, Lissa; McCulloch, Marti L; Weinert, Lynn; Raman, Jai; Little, Stephen H; Xu, Jiaqiong; Lawrie, Gerald M; Zoghbi, William A",Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography : official publication of the American Society of Echocardiography,4,25

This study aimed to measure the production and health performance of broilers treated with different vaccination regimes. A total of 108 Cobb 500 broiler birds were randomly divided into three treatment groups, with six replicates consisting of six birds per replicate. Each treatment group was administered with different vaccination regimes against Newcastle Disease (ND), Infectious Bronchitis (IB) and Infectious Bursal Disease (IBD). Treatment 1 (T1) broilers were vaccinated against ND+IB and IBD on days 7 and 14 of age, respectively (control); Treatment 2 (T2) broilers were vaccinated against ND+IB on days 3 and 7 of age, and IBD on day 14; and Treatment 3 (T3) broilers were vaccinated against ND+IB on days 7 and 21 and IBD on day 14. Throughout the 42-day study period, data and samples were collected to determine the growth performance, immune status, carcass characteristics and meat quality. There were significant differences (P<0.05) on growth performance (body weight, body weight gain, feed intake and cumulative feed conversion ratio), white blood cell count (heterophils percentage, lymphocytes percentage and heterophils to lymphocytes ratio), carcass characteristics (kill-out weight, de-feathered weight, dressing percentage, drumsticks and gastrointestinal tract weight) and meat quality (cooking loss and drip loss) between treatments. T1 broilers showed better growth, white blood cell count, carcass characteristics and meat quality compared to T2 and T3 broilers. Based on findings from the current work, vaccination against ND+IB and IBD on days 7 and 14 proved to be the best vaccination regime for broiler production, due to the better production performance and health status of broilers.","Chung, E L T; Alghirani, M M; Kamalludin, M H; Nayan, N; Jesse, F F A; Wei, O T A; Stephen, M A F M H; Reduan, M F H; Loh, T C",British poultry science,4,16

However, in comparison to environmental data, global data on the social determinants of health is spatially coarse, infrequently updated, and costly to measure. From global mapping efforts of the recent COVID-19 pandemic it is clear that social data is not meeting the fine spatial quality needed for mapping vulnerable populations and transmission pathways. Most maps produced generalized to larger administrative units (such as counties, states), and have not identified distinct areas of vulnerable populations apart from the surrounding environment where no population resides. We present a framework that uses environmental determinants of health, instead of social ones. Other studies that link the environment to human health have done so by analyzing one ecosystem service (such as clean air) to the health of the population. Instead of relating one ecosystem service to the health of the population, this framework breaks the environmental features that produce the ecosystem service into parts (forest, temperature, precipitation). Each feature is then related to human health. With the amount of data available it is feasible to include change in monitored features over time, and create predictors for the impact of the change of monitored features on the health of populations. This framework generalizes ecosystem services and disservices into one value that an environmental feature provides. This helps to manage uncertainty of how an individual ecosystem service affects health. Application of this framework will allow for fine scale monitoring of vulnerable populations and transmission pathways of various infectious diseases. This framework is particularly relevant to newly emerging infectious diseases, such as COVID19, whose socially determinant risk factors are unknown (or data scarce) and to which we have to respond in a rapid manner.","Price, Thomas Ryan Vernon; Barua, Sepul Kanti",The Science of the total environment,4,1

Dynamic contrast enhanced ultrasound (DCE-US) is a method that provides quantitative assessments of organ perfusion without ionising radiation or risk of nephrotoxicity. It can be performed at the bedside and is suitable for repeated measurements. The purpose of this review is to provide updates from recent publications on the utility of DCE-US in the diagnosis or assessment of renal disease, excluding the evaluation of benign or malignant renal masses. RECENT FINDINGS DCE-US has been applied in clinical studies of acute kidney injury (AKI), renal transplantation, chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetic kidney disease and to determine acute effects of pharmacological agents on renal haemodynamics. DCE-US can detect changes in renal perfusion across these clinical scenarios and can differentiate healthy controls from those with CKD. In sepsis, reduced DCE-US measures of perfusion may indicate those at increased risk of developing AKI, but this requires confirmation in larger studies as there can be wide individual variation in perfusion measures in acutely unwell patients. Recent studies in transplantation have not provided robust evidence to show that DCE-US can differentiate between different causes of graft dysfunction, although it may show more promise as a prognostic indicator of graft function 1 year after transplant. DCE-US can detect acute haemodynamic changes in response to medication that correlate with changes in renal plasma flow as measured by para-aminohippurate clearance. SUMMARY DCE-US shows promise and has a number of advantages that make it suitable for the assessment of patients with various forms of kidney disease. However, further research is required to evidence its reproducibility and utility before clinical use can be advocated.","Selby, Nicholas M; Williams, John P; Phillips, Bethan E",Current opinion in nephrology and hypertension,4,5

OBJECTIVE The objective of this review article is to define the indication and results of the treatment of intracranial aneurysms by FDD, reviewing 18 studies of endovascular treatment by FDDs for a total of 1704 aneurysms in 1483 patients. METHODS The medical literature on FDDs for intracranial aneurysms was reviewed from 2009 to December 2014. The keywords used were: ""intracranial aneurysms,"" ""brain aneurysms,"" ""flow diverter,"" ""pipeline embolization device,"" ""silk flow diverter,"" ""surpass flow diverter"" and ""FRED flow diverter."" RESULTS The use of these stents is advisable mainly for unruptured aneurysms, particularly those located at the internal carotid artery or vertebral and basilar arteries, for fusiform and dissecting aneurysms and for saccular aneurysms with large necks and low dome-to-neck ratio. The rate of aneurysm occlusion progressively increases during follow-up (81.5% overall rate in this review). The non-negligible rate of ischemic (mean 4.1%) and hemorrhagic (mean 2.9%) complications, the neurological morbidity (mean 3.5%) and the reported mortality (mean 3.4%) are the main limits of this technique. CONCLUSION Treatment with FDDs is a feasible and effective technique for unruptured aneurysms with complex anatomy (fusiform, dissecting, large neck, bifurcation with side branches) where coiling and clipping are difficult or impossible. Patient selection is very important to avoid complications and reduce the risk of morbidity and mortality. Further studies with longer follow-up are necessary to define the rate of complete occlusion.","Briganti, Francesco; Leone, Giuseppe; Marseglia, Mariano; Mariniello, Giuseppe; Caranci, Ferdinando; Brunetti, Arturo; Maiuri, Francesco",The neuroradiology journal,4,31

The only widely established marker of endometrial stromal differentiation, CD10, has marginal specificity. We took a bioinformatics approach to identify more specific markers of endometrial stromal differentiation by searching the Human Protein Atlas, a public database of protein expression profiles. After screening the database using different methods, interferon-induced transmembrane protein 1 (IFITM1) was selected for further analysis. Immunohistochemistry for IFITM1 was performed using tissue sections from the selected cases of proliferative endometrium (22), secretory endometrium (6), inactive endometrium (19), adenomyosis (10), conventional leiomyoma (11), cellular leiomyoma (16), endometrial stromal nodule (2), low-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma (16), high-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma (2) and undifferentiated uterine sarcoma (2). Stained slides were scored in terms of intensity and distribution. Normal endometrial samples uniformly showed diffuse and strong IFITM1 staining. Endometrial stromal neoplasms, particularly low-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma, showed higher IFITM1 expression compared with smooth muscle neoplasms (P<0.0001). IFITM1 immunohistochemistry has high sensitivity and specificity, particularly in the distinction between low-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma and leiomyoma (81.2 and 86.7%, respectively). Our results indicate that IFITM1 is a sensitive and specific marker of endometrial stromal differentiation across the spectrum from proliferative endometrium to metastatic stromal sarcoma. IFITM1 is a potential valuable addition to immunohistochemical panels used in the diagnosis of cellular mesenchymal uterine tumors. Further studies with larger number of cases are necessary to corroborate this impression and determine the utility of IFITM1 in routine practice. This study is a clear example of how bioinformatics, particularly tools for mining genomic and proteomic databases, can enhance and accelerate biomarker development in diagnostic pathology.","Parra-Herran, Carlos E; Yuan, Liping; Nucci, Marisa R; Quade, Bradley J","Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",4,16

BACKGROUND Midwives provide care to childbearing women across the continuum and are key members of the maternity workforce in Australia. AIM To explore and describe midwives' experiences of providing maternity care during the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia. METHODS A two-phased cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted. Data were collected through an online survey and semi-structured interviews between May-June 2020. FINDINGS Six hundred and twenty midwives responded to the online survey. Many reported a move to telehealth appointments. For labour care, 70% of midwives reported women had limited support; 77% indicated postnatal visiting was impacted. Five main themes were derived from the qualitative data including: coping with rapid and radical changes, challenges to woman-centred care, managing professional resilience, addressing personal and professional challenges, and looking ahead. DISCUSSION Restrictions applied to women's choices, impacted midwives' ability to provide woman-centred care, which resulted in stress and anxiety for midwives. Professional resilience was supported through collaborative relationships and working in continuity models. Midwives revealed 'silver linings' experienced in providing care during the pandemic. CONCLUSION Findings provide valuable evidence to understand the impact on midwives who have provided care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Knowledge will be useful for health leaders and policy makers as they consider ways to continue care during the pandemic and support the essential midwifery workforce. Recommendations are presented to improve preparedness for future pandemics.","Bradfield, Zoe; Hauck, Yvonne; Homer, Caroline S E; Sweet, Linda; Wilson, Alyce N; Szabo, Rebecca A; Wynter, Karen; Vasilevski, Vidanka; Kuliukas, Lesley",Women and birth : journal of the Australian College of Midwives,4,15

Our team previously described the lipo-body lift (LBL) technique into lower duration of drainage and therefore seromas and other complications. In this study, we compared the classical body lift (CBL) technique to the LBL procedure. MATERIALS AND METHODS All patients who underwent a LBL or CBL after massive weight loss between November 2012 and October 2017 were included. Surgery outcome parameters were collected as well as patient satisfaction through a satisfaction score realized at least after 1 year postoperative. Comparisons between CBL and LBL were conducted to assess the surgery's safety and the patient's satisfaction. RESULTS A total of 130 patients were included, 61 patients who had a LBL were compared to 69 patients who had a CBL. The mean patient age was 39.64 ± 9.97 (21-66) years old, the mean body mass index before plastic surgery was 26.83 ± 3.08 kg/m2 (19.83-32.69), and the average weight loss was 53.40 ± 17.37 kg. The two groups had comparable preoperative data. Duration of drainage and hospital stay was significantly lower in the LBL group than in the CBL (p < 0.0001 and p < 0.0001, respectively). Surgical outcomes were comparable between groups as well as patient satisfaction scores. CONCLUSION Lipo-body lift allows early discharge of the patient by reducing the duration of drainage without increasing the risk for complications. In our opinion, this technique should be used for type 1 and 2 patients with no contraindication for abdominal liposuction.

METHODS The distance from the vertex of the bend to the tip (bend-to-tip distance) of seven brands of preformed oral and nasal ETTs were measured. Front teeth-to-carina (FTC) and nares-to-carina (NC) distance data from orally (0-19 years) and nasally (0-8 years) intubated children were used to assess the risk of endobronchial intubation if a preformed ETT had been placed with its bend at the front teeth or nares. RESULTS While the bend-to-tip distance of a cuffed oral preformed ETT only differed by 0-1 cm from a same size ETT from another brand, uncuffed oral ETTs differed by 0-4 cm. The bend-to-tip distance of cuffed and uncuffed ETTs of the same brand and size differed by 0-3 cm. Had preformed cuffed oral ETTs been placed with their bends at the front teeth in children of the FTC reference group, endobronchial intubation would have occurred in 0-27% of the patients, depending on the size and brand of the used ETT. In contrast to oral ETTs, the bend-to-tip distance of cuffed nasal ETTs differed more (0-5.5 cm) between brands, and uncuffed nasal ETTs less (0-3 cm). Also, the bend-to-tip distance of a cuffed nasal ETT was consistently greater (2-9 cm) than that of a same brand and size nasal uncuffed ETT. Had a preformed cuffed nasal ETT been placed with its bend at the nares in the NC reference group, 50-100% of the patients would have been endobronchially intubated. CONCLUSION The bend-to-tip distance of preformed ETTs varies between brands, especially for nasal tubes. Some preformed tubes are not well suited for routine use in children. There is a high risk for accidental endobronchial intubation if a cuffed preformed ETT is positioned with its bend at the front teeth or nares in a young child. ETT tube tip position needs to be carefully controlled when a preformed ETT is used in a child.","Hunyady, Agnes I; Jonmarker, Christer",Paediatric anaesthesia,4,1

This study maps the current field of HIA and health in EIA to examine the scientific landscape of the field. METHODS We carried out a bibliometric analysis of HIA papers and EIA papers that included a health focus in peer-reviewed journals in the Web of Science Core Collection (n = 229). We carried out co-authorship and co-citation network analyses of authors and documents in VOSviewer. RESULTS We identified two main co-authorship and co-citation groupings. Our document co-citation analysis also identified four clusters with two major groups, the Defining HIA cluster and the Describing the fields cluster versus the Active transport quantitative HIA cluster, and the Quantitative modelling tools cluster. CONCLUSION Our findings strongly suggest that there exist two groups of thought in the scholarly fields of HIA and health in EIA. Barriers to developing more methodologically integrated approaches to considering health within EIA are related more to disciplinary differences than field (HIA versus EIA)-based differences and we advocate for the development of transdisciplinary approaches to both HIA and EIA.","Kim, Jinhee; Haigh, Fiona Anne",International journal of environmental research and public health,4,1

Previous research suggested the existence of three attentional networks: alerting, orienting and executive. However, one important topic is how to enhance the efficiency of attentional networks. In this context, understanding how this system behaves under two different modulatory conditions, namely transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and transcranial Random Noise Stimulation (tRNS), will provide important insights towards the understanding of the attention network system. Twenty-seven healthy students took part on a randomized single-blinded crossover study, testing the effects that involved three modalities of unilateral stimulation (tRNS, anodal tDCS, and sham) over the DLPFC, during the performance of the attention network test (ANT) in three different conditions: standard, speed and accuracy. Results showed that tRNS was able to increase attention during more complex situations, namely by increasing alerting and decreasing conflict effect in the executive network. Under the Speed condition, tRNS increased efficiency of the alerting network, as well as under the more demanding conflict network, tRNS overall increased the performance when comparing to sham. No statistical significant effects of tDCS were observed. These results are compatible with the attention requiring the synchronization of pre-existing networks, rather the reinforcement or creation of new pathways.","Lema, Alberto; Carvalho, Sandra; Fregni, Felipe; Gonçalves, Óscar F; Leite, Jorge",Scientific reports,4,1

We hope that this review will provide holistic understanding about MONs and their application in cancer immunotherapy, and thus pave the way to the translation from bench to bedside in the future.","Ding, Binbin; Yue, Jun; Zheng, Pan; Ma, Ping'an; Lin, Jun",Journal of materials chemistry.

In the past, biosensors based on synthetic biology have been designed on living cells, but the development of cell biosensors has been greatly limited by defects such as GMO problem and the obstruction of cell membrane. However, the advent of cell-free synthetic biology addresses these limitations. Biosensors based on the cell-free protein synthesis system have the advantages of higher safety, higher sensitivity, and faster response time over cell biosensors, which makes cell-free biosensors have a broader application prospect. This review summarizes the workflow of various cell-free biosensors, including the identification of analytes and signal output. The detection range of cell-free biosensors is greatly enlarged by different recognition mechanisms and output methods. In addition, the review also discusses the applications of cell-free biosensors in environmental monitoring and health diagnosis, as well as existing deficiencies and aspects that should be improved. In the future, through continuous improvement and optimization, the potential of cell-free biosensors will be stimulated, and their application fields will be expanded.

The unprecedented scale and rapidity of dissemination of recent emerging infectious diseases pose new challenges for vaccine developers, regulators, health authorities and political constituencies. Vaccine manufacturing and distribution are complex and challenging. While speed is essential, clinical development to emergency use authorization and licensure, pharmacovigilance of vaccine safety and surveillance of virus variants are also critical. Access to vaccines and vaccination needs to be prioritized in low- and middle-income countries.

We explore trends in loneliness before and during the pandemic and differences across population subgroups. METHODS Data were collected via online questionnaires in June 2020 and four to eight months prior in two Norwegian counties (N=10,740; 54% women; age 19-92 years). Baseline data come from the Norwegian Counties Public Health Survey (participation rate 46%, of which 59% took part in a COVID-19 follow-up study). RESULTS Overall loneliness was stable or falling during the lockdown. However, some subgroups, single individuals and older women, reported slightly increased loneliness during lockdown. Interestingly, individuals with low social support and high levels of psychological distress and loneliness before the pandemic experienced decreasing loneliness during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS Although data limitations preclude strong conclusions, our findings suggest that, overall, Norwegians seem to have managed the lockdown without alarming increases in loneliness. It is important to provide support and to continue investigating the psychological impact of the pandemic over time and across regions differentially affected by the pandemic.","Hansen, Thomas; Nilsen, Thomas S; Yu, Baeksan; Knapstad, Marit; Skogen, Jens Christoffer; Vedaa, Øystein; Nes, Ragnhild Bang",Scandinavian journal of public health,4,1

While it allows for improved cosmesis, faster recovery and decreased length of hospital stay compared with the open approach, instrument articulation limitations can hamper surgical dexterity in pediatric patients. Use of robotic assistance can greatly enhance operative field visualization and instrument control, and is in the early stages of adoption in academic centers for pediatric populations. CASE PRESENTATION We present a single-institution series of pediatric adrenalectomy cases. The da Vinci Xi surgical system was used to perform adrenalectomies on three consecutive patients (ages, 2-13 years) at our center. Final pathology revealed ganglioneuroblastoma (n = 2) and pheochromocytoma (n = 1). Median operating time was 244 min (range, 244-265 min); median blood loss was estimated at 100 ml (range, 15-175 ml). Specimens were delivered intact and all margins were negative. Median post-operative hospital stay was 2 days (range, 1-6 days). All patients remain disease-free at median follow-up of 19 months (range, 12-30 months). CONCLUSION Our experience continues to evolve, and suggests that robotic surgery is safe, feasible and oncologically effective for resection of adrenal masses in well-selected pediatric patients.","Mitra, Anirban P; Vasquez, Evalynn; Kokorowski, Paul; Chang, Andy Y",BMC urology,4,1

The fracture was stable and was mobilised in a flexible splint. Oral antibiotics were commenced in recognition of the risk of flexor sheath and bone inoculation. While the most severe complications associated with Taser are related to the electrical component, the most common injuries are associated with falls and barb penetrations.

Used widely in qualitative studies, its uptake in quantitative research has been more recent. Objectives To characterize quantitative research applications of intersectionality from 1989 to mid-2020, to evaluate basic integration of theoretical frameworks, and to identify innovative methods that could be applied to health research. Methods Adhering to PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a systematic review of peer-reviewed articles indexed within Scopus, Medline, ProQuest Political Science and Public Administration, and PsycINFO. Original English-language quantitative or mixed-methods research or methods papers that explicitly applied intersectionality theoretical frameworks were included. Experimental studies on perception/stereotyping and measures development or validation studies were excluded. We extracted data related to publication, study design, quantitative methods, and application of intersectionality. Results 707 articles (671 applied studies, 25 methods-only papers, 11 methods plus application) met inclusion criteria. Articles were published in journals across a range of disciplines, most commonly psychology, sociology, and medical/life sciences; 40.8% studied a health-related outcome. Results supported concerns among intersectionality scholars that core theoretical tenets are often lost or misinterpreted in quantitative research; about one in four applied articles (26.9%) failed to define intersectionality, while one in six (17.5%) included intersectional position components not reflective of social power. Quantitative methods were simplistic (most often regression with interactions, cross-classified variables, or stratification) and were often misapplied or misinterpreted. Several novel methods were identified. Conclusions Intersectionality is frequently misunderstood when bridging theory into quantitative methodology. Further work is required to (1) ensure researchers understand key features that define quantitative intersectionality analyses, (2) improve reporting practices for intersectional analyses, and (3) develop and adapt quantitative methods.","Bauer, Greta R; Churchill, Siobhan M; Mahendran, Mayuri; Walwyn, Chantel; Lizotte, Daniel; Villa-Rueda, Alma Angelica",SSM - population health,4,1

Methods: This study was a retrospective study. A total of 7 patients with Heart failure and 12 patients with COVID-19 in the Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University between December 1, 2019 and February 15, 2020 were enrolled. The baseline clinical and imaging features of the two groups were statistically analyzed. Results: There was no significant difference in age and sex between the two groups, but the incidence of epidemiological contact history, fever or respiratory symptoms in the COVID-19 group was significantly higher than that in the heart failure group (12/12 vs. 2/7, P=0.001; 12/12 vs. 4/7, P<0.001). While the proportion of cardiovascular diseases and impaired cardiac function was significantly less than that of the heart failure group(2/12 vs.7/7, P<0.001; 0/12 vs.7/7, P<0.001). For imaging features, both groups had ground-glass opacity and thickening of interlobular septum, but the ratio of central and gradient distribution was higher in patients with heart failure than that in patients with COVID-19 (4/7 vs. 1/12, P=0.04). In heart failure group, the ratio of the expansion of small pulmonary veins was also higher (3/7 vs. 0, P=0.013), and the lung lesions can be significantly improved after effective anti-heart failure treatment. Besides, there are more disease with rounded morphology in COVID-19 (9/12 vs. 2/7, P=0.048) . Conclusions: More patients with COVID-19 have epidemiological history and fever or respiratory symptoms.

MATERIAL/METHODS After ethics approval, CESM and MRI examinations were performed in 102 patients who had suspicious lesions described in conventional mammography. All visible lesions were evaluated independently by 2 experienced radiologists using BI-RADS classifications (scale 1-5). Dimensions of lesions measured with each modality were compared to postoperative histopathology results. RESULTS There were 102 patients entered into CESM/MRI studies and 118 lesions were identified by the combination of CESM and breast MRI. Histopathology confirmed that 81 of 118 lesions were malignant and 37 were benign. Of the 81 malignant lesions, 72 were invasive cancers and 9 were in situ cancers. Sensitivity was 100% with CESM and 93% with breast MRI. Accuracy was 79% with CESM and 73% with breast MRI. ROC curve areas based on BI-RADS were 0.83 for CESM and 0.84 for breast MRI. Lesion size estimates on CESM and breast MRI were similar, both slightly larger than those from histopathology. CONCLUSIONS Our results indicate that CESM has the potential to be a valuable diagnostic method that enables accurate detection of malignant breast lesions, has high negative predictive value, and a false-positive rate similar to that of breast MRI.","Łuczyńska, Elżbieta; Heinze-Paluchowska, Sylwia; Hendrick, Edward; Dyczek, Sonia; Ryś, Janusz; Herman, Krzysztof; Blecharz, Paweł; Jakubowicz, Jerzy",Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,4,27

Teaching surgical skills has historically been a hands-on activity, with instructors and learners in close physical proximity. This paradigm was disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, requiring innovative solutions to surmount the challenges of teaching surgical skills remotely. In this work, we describe our institution's path and early results of developing an interactive remote surgical skills course for medical students in the surgical clerkship. Methods. 31 third-year medical students were distributed a set of surgical equipment and 3D printed phone dock. Each participant completed a baseline questionnaire and underwent 3 structured interactive remote sessions on surgical instruments, knot tying, and suturing techniques. Students were instructed on sharing their first-person viewpoint and received real-time feedback on their knot tying and suturing techniques from the course instructor. Pre- and post-session surveys were conducted and analyzed. Results. All students were able to complete the remote surgical skills course successfully, as defined by visually demonstrating successful two-handed knot and simple suture techniques. Students' aggregate confidence score in their knot tying ability (pretest mean 7.9, SD 0.7 vs posttest mean 9.7, SD 0.9, t-statistic -2.3, P = .03) and suturing ability (pretest mean 8.0, SD 1.3 vs posttest mean 13.8, SD 0.9 t-statistic -5.5, P < .001) significantly improved after the intervention. Qualitative feedback from the students underscored the utility of the first-person perspective for teaching surgical technique. Conclusion. This study demonstrates that remote teaching of knot tying and simple suturing to medical students can be effectively implemented using a remote learning curriculum that was well received by the learners.","Quaranto, Brian R; Lamb, Michael; Traversone, John; Hu, Jinwei; Lukan, James; Cooper, Clairice; Schwaitzberg, Steven",Surgical innovation,4,31

However, it is unclear how many patients have a DRE performed at the primary care level in the work-up of rectal cancer, and if the absence of a DRE causes a delay to consultation with a specialist. Methods: A retrospective patient questionnaire was sent to 1000 consecutive patients with stage II or stage III rectal cancer. The questionnaire asked patients to recall if they had a DRE performed by their general practitioner (GP) when they first presented with symptoms or a positive FIT test. Demographic data, staging data, and time to consultation with a specialist were also collected. Results: A thousand surveys were mailed out, and a total of 262 patients responded. Of the respondents, 46.2% did not recall undergoing a digital rectal examination by their primary care provider. Women were less likely to undergo a DRE than men (28.6% vs. 44.3%, p = 0.019). While there was a trend towards longer times to specialist consultation in patients who did not undergo a DRE (27.0 vs. 12.2 weeks), this was not statistically significant (p = 0.121). Conclusion: A significant proportion of patients who are FIT positive or have symptomatic rectal bleeding do not recall having a DRE by their primary care provider. Barriers may include lack of comfort with performing DRE or lack of time. Clearer guidelines and more support for GP's may increase uptake of DRE.","Farooq, Omar; Farooq, Ameer; Ghosh, Sunita; Qadri, Raza; Steed, Tanner; Quinton, Mitch; Usmani, Nawaid",Healthcare,4,19

We demonstrate an adaptive microscope employing a tunable objective and a tunable eyepiece with large zooming range. The tunable objective consists of three glass lenses and four electrowetting liquid lenses. The tunable eyepiece consists of an achromatic eyepiece and an electrowetting liquid lens. The focal point between the objective and the eyepiece is designed to be tunable, which are controlled by voltages. Thus, the tuning range is relatively large. We fabricate the adaptive microscope and observe the specimen. In the experiment, the magnification of the microscope changes continuously from ~ 59.1 × to ~ 159.2 × , and the largest numerical aperture is ~ 0.212. The tunable eyepiece can release the back focal length of the tunable objective, which increases the zoom range of the microscope.

The recent Coronavirus [severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2]-associated multiorgan disease, called COVID-19, has high morbidity and mortality due to autoimmune destruction of the lungs stemming from the release of a storm of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Defense against this Corona virus requires activated T cells and specific antibodies. Instead, cytokines are responsible for the serious sequelae of COVID-19 that damage the lungs. Dexamethasone is a synthetic corticosteroid approved by the FDA 1958 as a broad-spectrum immunosuppressor and it is about 30 times as active and with longer duration of action (2-3 days) than cortisone. Dexamethasone would limit the production of and damaging effect of the cytokines, but will also inhibit the protective function of T cells and block B cells from making antibodies, potentially leading to increased plasma viral load that will persist after a patient survives SARS. Moreover, dexamethasone would block macrophages from clearing secondary, nosocomial, infections. Hence, dexamethasone may be useful for the short-term in severe, intubated, COVID-19 patients, but could be outright dangerous during recovery since the virus will not only persist, but the body will be prevented from generating protective antibodies. Instead, a pulse of intravenous dexamethasone may be followed by administration of nebulized triamcinolone (6 times as active as cortisone) to concentrate in the lungs only. These corticosteroids could be given together with the natural flavonoid luteolin because of its antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties, especially its ability to inhibit mast cells, which are the main source of cytokines in the lungs. At the end, we should remember that ""The good physician treats the disease; the great physician treats the patient who has the disease"" [Sir William Osler's (1849-1919)].","Theoharides, T C; Conti, P",Journal of biological regulators and homeostatic agents,4,1

We report a multicenter retrospective analysis of the safety and efficacy in the treatment of intracranial aneurysms with the Flow-Redirection Endoluminal Device (FRED) flow diverter, a dual-layer flow-modulation device. MATERIALS AND METHODS All intracranial aneurysms treated with the FRED between March 2013 and February 2016 at 4 neurovascular centers were included. Angiographic and clinical results were retrospectively analyzed, including all follow-up examinations. Aneurysms were unruptured in 44 cases, whereas 8 treatments were due to an acute SAH from the target aneurysm. RESULTS Successful implantation of the FRED was possible in 96.2% (50/52) of cases. At 3-month follow-up, complete occlusion was determined in 58.1% (25/43) and near-complete in 25.6% (11/43). At 12-month follow-up, aneurysm occlusion was complete in 75.0% (27/36) and near-complete in 22.2% (8/36). The overall acute and late thromboembolic and hemorrhagic complication rate was 17.3% (9/52), with a permanent treatment-related morbidity and mortality of 4.0% (2/50) and 2.0% (1/50), respectively, to date. CONCLUSIONS The FRED device offers an effective tool in the treatment of intracranial aneurysms. The dual-layer design promotes contemporary and stable long-term occlusion rates. Sufficient device expansion should be documented by angiographic CT. Further studies might help to identify a more optimal antiplatelet regimen to avoid thromboembolic complications during the follow-up period.","Drescher, F; Weber, W; Berlis, A; Rohde, S; Carolus, A; Fischer, S",AJNR.

Forty-two patients with colon cancer were included in the present study. Tumor tissues and tumor-adjacent tissues were collected from all patients. Bioinformatics was used to analyze how TRAF5 was related to metastasis and prognosis of colon cancer. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was carried out to determine the expression of mRNA. SW620 and SW480 cells were used to study the inhibition and overexpression of TRAF5, respectively. CCK-8 assay was used to examine cell proliferation. Flow cytometry was employed to investigate cell phase and apoptosis. Transwell assay was used to study migration and invasion of cells. Western blotting was utilized to test how TRAF5 expression affected the activities of PI3K/AKT/NF-κB signaling pathways. Bioinformatics showed that the expression of TRAF5 in colon cancer tissues was correlated with metastasis and prognosis of the tumor. TRAF5 mRNA expression was up-regulated in colon cancer tissues, and related to recurrence and metastasis of the cancer. In vitro experiments showed that TRAF5 expression promoted proliferation, migration, and invasion of colon cancer cells, but reduced apoptosis of the cells. Moreover, TRAF5 might exert its biological functions by activating PI3K/AKT/NF-κB signaling pathways in colon cancer cells. In conclusion, TRAF5 expression in colon cancer tissues is up-regulated and correlated with prognosis, lymphatic metastasis and clinical staging. TRAF5 promotes the occurrence and development of colon cancer by activating PI3K/ AKT/NF-κB signaling pathways, and acts as an oncogene.","Sun, G; Zheng, C; Deng, Z; Huang, C; Huang, J",Journal of biological regulators and homeostatic agents,4,17

Gridded observations, reanalysis, and global-coupled climate models from CMIP5 were used with the approach of temperature extreme trend attribution analysis on fixed-threshold and percentile-based temperature extremes indices defined by the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI). The largest positive trends are exhibited in the tropical nights index, and a clear anthropogenic signal is evident in the subtropical region. In the subtropical central Andes, there is a decrease in the frost days index and increases in the tropical nights and summer days indices, and an anthropogenic signal is evident. In the Patagonian region, all trends from the historical runs were significant, while the ones from the natural experiment were nonsignificant, showing the marked effect of anthropogenic forcing in this region in the extreme temperature events. Projected changes in extreme indices for the 21st century are consistent with a warming climate, and larger changes are expected in the warm nights index.","Rusticucci, Matilde; Zazulie, Natalia",Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,4,1

Synaptic plasticity mechanisms within the nucleus accumbens (NAc) mediate differential behavioral adaptations. Feedforward inhibition in the NAc occurs when glutamatergic afferents onto medium spiny neurons (MSNs) collateralize onto fast-spiking parvalbumin (PV)-expressing interneurons (PV-INs), which exert GABAergic control over MSN action potential generation. Here, we find that feedforward glutamatergic synapses onto PV-INs in the NAc core selectively express Ca2+-permeable AMPA receptors (CP-AMPARs). Ca2+ influx by CP-AMPARs on PV-INs triggers long-term depression (LTD) mediated by endocannabinoid (eCB) signaling at presynaptic cannabinoid type-1 (CB1) receptors (CB1Rs). Moreover, CP-AMPARs authorize tonic eCB signaling to negatively regulate glutamate release probability. Blockade of CP-AMPARs in the NAc core in vivo is sufficient to disinhibit locomotor output. These findings elucidate mechanisms by which PV-IN-embedded microcircuits in the NAc undergo activity-dependent shifts in synaptic strength.","Manz, Kevin M; Ghose, Dipanwita; Turner, Brandon D; Taylor, Anne; Becker, Jennifer; Grueter, Carrie A; Grueter, Brad A",Cell reports,4,1

Several clinical trials have shown conflicting results and it is not clear whether the available evidence is in favour or against the use of Azithromycin in COVID-19 patients. We aim to investigate the efficacy and safety of Azithromycin in COVID-19 patients. Four independent reviewers selected relevant studies from PubMed, ScienceDirect, EBSCO, and ProQuest published prior to March 2021. The protocol used in this study has been registered in PROSPERO (CRD42020224967).

METHODS A total population retrospective epidemiological study of unintentional drowning deaths in Australia between 1 July 2009 and 30 June 2019 of people born outside Australia (migrants). Cases were extracted from the National Coronial Information System. Descriptive statistics, chi-square and relative risk were calculated. Crude drowning rates were based on country of birth and population in Australia. RESULTS There were 572 migrant deaths over the study period, 28.9% of total drowning deaths, 82.9% were male. Twenty-one per cent were aged 25-34 years and 40.8% had lived in Australia for 20+ years. Migrants at highest risk of drowning were from: South Korea (2.63/100,000 95%CI: 0.85-8.25), Taiwan (2.29/100,000 95%CI: 0.27-13.44), and Nepal (2.15/100,000 95%CI: 0.23-11.55). Migrants were more likely to drown when around rocks (p<0.001) compared with Australian-born people, who most frequently drowned in rivers (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS Migrants are not over-represented in drowning statistics. However, unique trends were found for drowning among migrants based on country of birth and length of time in Australia. Implications for public health: Holistic drowning prevention strategies and policies are required to effectively lower drowning risk among migrant communities.","Willcox-Pidgeon, Stacey; Franklin, Richard C; Leggat, Peter A; Devine, Susan",Australian and New Zealand journal of public health,4,1

The mechanism of such tissue-selective dissection has been unknown. The novel piezo actuator-driven pulsed water jet (ADPJ) system can achieve dissection with remarkably reduced water consumption compared to the conventional water jet; however, the system's characteristics and dissection capabilities on any organ have not been clarified. The purposes of this study were to characterize the physical properties of the novel ADPJ system, evaluate the dissection ability in swine organs, and reveal the mechanism of tissue-selective dissection. METHODS The pulsed water jet system comprised a pump chamber driven by a piezo actuator, a stainless steel tube, and a nozzle. The peak pressure of the pulsed water jet was measured through a sensing hole using a pressure sensor. The pulsed water jet technique was applied on swine liver in order to dissect tissue on a moving table using one-way linear ejection at a constant speed. The dissection depth was measured with light microscopy and evaluated histologically. The physical properties of swine liver were evaluated by breaking strength tests using tabletop universal testing instruments. The liver parenchyma was also cut with three currently available surgical devices to compare the histological findings. RESULTS The peak pressure of the pulsed water jet positively correlated with the input voltage (R(2) = 0.9982, p < 0.0001), and this was reflected in the dissection depth. The dissection depth negatively correlated with the breaking strength of the liver parenchyma (R(2) = 0.6694, p < 0.0001). The average breaking strengths of the liver parenchyma, hepatic veins, and Glisson's sheaths were 1.41 ± 0.45, 8.66 ± 1.70, and 29.6 ± 11.0 MPa, respectively. The breaking strength of the liver parenchyma was significantly lower than that of the hepatic veins and Glisson's sheaths. Histological staining confirmed that the liver parenchyma was selectively dissected, preserving the hepatic veins and Glisson's sheaths in contrast to what is commonly observed with electrocautery or ultrasonic instruments. CONCLUSIONS The dissection depth of liver tissue is well controlled by input voltage and is influenced by the moving velocity and the physical properties of the organ. We showed that the device can be used to assure liver resection with tissue selectivity due to tissue-specific physical properties. Although this study uses an excised organ, further in vivo studies are necessary. The present work demonstrates that this device may function as an alternative tool for surgery due to its good controllability of the dissection depth and ability of tissue selectivity.","Yamada, Masato; Nakano, Toru; Sato, Chiaki; Nakagawa, Atsuhiro; Fujishima, Fumiyoshi; Kawagishi, Naoki; Nakanishi, Chikashi; Sakurai, Tadashi; Miyata, Go; Tominaga, Teiji; Ohuchi, Noriaki",European surgical research.

There are non-pharmacological interventions that may be of benefit during the acute episode preceding syncope (presyncope), including physical counter-pressure maneuvers (PCM) or change of body position. We performed a systematic review of interventions that may be applied during presyncope as an immediate, first aid tactic. METHODS We searched Medline, Embase, and CINAHL and used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation methods, and risk of bias assessments to determine the certainty of the evidence. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), non-randomized studies, and case series investigating adults and children with signs and symptoms of presyncope of suspected vasovagal or orthostatic origin who applied any intervention that could be used as an immediate, first aid intervention. We examined the following outcomes: prevention of syncope, adverse events, symptom improvement, and vital signs. We conducted a sub-group analysis based on the etiology of vasovagal or orthostatic presyncope. RESULTS We screened 5,160 titles and abstracts followed by 81 full text articles. We identified 8 studies meeting inclusion criteria, including 2 RCTs and 6 observational studies. All studies used PCM in adults and all were judged to be of low and very low certainty of evidence. For prevention of syncope, one RCT demonstrated benefit with the use of PCM (RR = 1.80 [1.26-1.89]), while observational studies failed to show benefit (RR = 1.31 [0.98 - 1.75]). Two RCTs showed benefit in symptom improvement (RR = 6.00 [2.21 - 8.61] and (RR = 1.57 [1.06 - 1.93]). Blood pressure (BP) improved with the use of PCM: systolic BP mean difference (MD) 21 mmHg higher (95% CI: 18.25 to 23.41 BPM) and diastolic BP MD 11 mmHg higher (95% CI: 9.39 to 13.10 mmHg higher). No adverse events were reported. CONCLUSION While there is a minimal amount of evidence available and the findings were mixed, PCM may provide benefit for prevention of syncope during acute episodes of presyncope and may be tried in the first aid setting. No evidence was found for other non-pharmacologic interventions or for the use of PCM in children.","Jensen, Jan L; Ohshimo, Shinichiro; Cassan, Pascal; Meyran, Daniel; Greene, Jennifer; Ng, Kee Chong; Singletary, Eunice; Zideman, David",Prehospital emergency care : official journal of the National Association of EMS Physicians and the National Association of State EMS Directors,4,27

The transcription factor IRF3 is a central regulator of type I interferon (IFN) innate immune signalling. Here, we report that PHEV infection of RAW264.7 cells results in strong suppression of IFN-β production in the early stage. A comparative analysis of the upstream effector of IFN-β transcription demonstrated that deactivation of IRF3, but not p65 or ATF-2 proteins, is uniquely attributed to failure of early IFN-β induction. Moreover, the RIG-I/MDA5/MAVS/TBK1-dependent protective response that regulates the IRF3 pathway is not disrupted by PHEV and works well underlying the deactivated IRF3-mediated IFN-β inhibition. After challenge with poly(I:C), a synthetic analogue of dsRNA used to stimulate IFN-β secretion in the TLR-controlled pathway, we show that PHEV and poly(I:C) regulate IFN-β-induction via two different pathways. Collectively, our findings reveal that deactivation of IRF3 is a specific mechanism that contributes to termination of type I IFN signalling during early infection with PHEV independent of the conserved RIG-I/MAVS/MDA5/TBK1-mediated innate immune response.","Li, Zi; Yang, Yawen; Lu, Huijun; Zhang, Jing; Xu, Rongyi; Shi, Junchao; Lan, Yungang; Guan, Jiyu; Zhao, Kui; He, Hongbin; Gao, Feng; He, Wenqi",Veterinary microbiology,4,29

Study Design Prospective cohort study. Setting Tertiary endocrine surgery practice in an academic medical center. Subjects and Methods Institutional review board-approved trial in which 136 subjects were recruited from a population of patients being seen for either thyroid or sinus surgery and evaluated standardized photographs, superimposed with computer-generated thyroidectomy scars of varying lengths (2, 4, and 6 cm) and widths (1 and 2 mm), and graded their perception of the scars using the observer scar assessment scale (OSAS) domains of the patient and observer scar assessment scale. Results There were 69 subjects in the thyroid group and 67 in the nonthyroid group. Controlling for width, longer scars were perceived as worse than shorter scars; controlling for length, thicker scars were perceived as worse than thinner scars ( P < .01). Beyond 2 cm, thick scars were judged to be worse than thin scars, even when they were shorter. There was no difference in the mean overall OSAS scores between surgery, sex, or age groups. Nonwhites tended to judge scars as being worse than whites did ( P < .01). Conclusion As expected, patients of all demographics prefer shorter scars compared with longer scars and thinner scars over thick scars. Ethnic differences in scar perception were identified and deserve additional study. Surgeons should endeavor to perform thyroid surgery through the smallest incision that allows the operation to be performed safely to minimize the cosmetic impact of the operation.","Chaung, Katrina; Duke, William S; Oh, Sun Jung; Behr, Amanda; Waller, Jennifer L; Daniel, Jeannie; Terris, David J",Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,4,20

Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) has been proven to detect PTX at the bedside. A so far not described pattern in the course of thoracic impedance at an early state of PTX was observed in a pig model of ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) used for a more extensive study. EIT was performed at a framerate of 50 Hz. Beginning of PTX at normal ventilation, manifestation of PTX at VILI ventilation (plateau pressure 42 cm H2 O) and final pleural drainage were documented. At ventilation with 8·6 ml kg-1 , early PTX findings prior to any clinical deterioration consisted in a spike-like pattern in the time course of impedance (relative impedance change referred to initial end-expiratory level). Spike amplitudes (mean ± SD) were the following: 0·154 ± 0·059 (right lung) and 0·048 ± 0·050 (left lung). At this state, end-expiratory levels (mean ± SD) were still similar, -0·035 ± 0·010 (right) and -0·058 ± 0·022 (left).

We assume that spikes reflect a temporary change in the electrical pathway caused by leakage into the pleural cavity. This newly described phenomenon of spikes is considered to be a potentially useful indicator for a very early detection of an evolving PTX in high-risk ICU patients.","Cambiaghi, B; Moerer, O; Kunze-Szikszay, N; Mauri, T; Just, A; Dittmar, J; Hahn, G",Clinical physiology and functional imaging,4,16

Responsive behaviours are not only a sign of underlying unmet needs, but when directed against (towards) paid staff can lead to decreased quality of work life, and may contribute to lower quality of care. In this systematic review, we aim to synthesise empirically based quantitative and qualitative evidence on factors and stakeholder (eg, staff and family members) experiences of factors associated with the responsive behaviours of people living in LTC directed towards staff. METHODS AND ANALYSIS This study will be a systematic review of published and 'grey' literature. Twelve bibliographical databases will be searched, and for each database, we will use appropriate subject headings and keywords that cover two concepts: LTC and responsive behaviour. No publication date or language filter will be used. The title and abstract of each extracted record will be screened, followed by screening of full text of included papers. Then data extraction and quality assessments will be undertaken. Each stage will be completed independently by pairs of authors. For quantitative studies, meta-analysis will be conducted if pooling is possible; otherwise, a critical narrative analysis will be conducted. For qualitative studies, thematic analysis will be conducted. Factors will then be organised at the individual, interpersonal, institutional and larger societal levels. Sensitivity analysis will be conducted to explore the influence of risk of bias and publication bias on the results. Subgroup analysis will be conducted for people who live with dementia and those who do not. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Ethics approval is not required for this systematic review. The results of this study will be disseminated via peer-reviewed publication and presentation at professional conferences.","Song, Yuting; Hoben, Matthias; Weeks, Lori; Boström, Anne-Marie; Goodarzi, Zahra S; Squires, Janet; Doan, Helen; Wagg, Adrian; Reid, R Colin; Estabrooks, Carole",BMJ open,4,29

METHODS This was a single-center, retrospective study of 46 consecutive patients treated from January 2008 to June 2012 with RFA under CT guidance for 57 poorly visible liver tumors after percutaneous coil insertion. Effectiveness was evaluated by the rate of local tumor progression (LTP), and the risk factors of LTP were evaluated by multiple univariate analysis. RESULTS After a mean follow-up of 15.9 months, the overall rate of LTP was 22.8 % (13/57). An increase in the distance between the coil and the center of the tumor was a predictive factor of LTP (p = 0.005) and resulted in an increase in time to place the RFA probe. LTP was significantly reduced in case of coil placed within the tumor (10 vs. 43.5 %, p = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS The effectiveness of the ""coil-assisted"" RFA for poorly visible liver tumors is improved by centering the coil in the tumor in order to facilitate the placement of the RFA probe and equal to the results of RFA under direct image guidance.","Farouil, Geoffroy; Deschamps, Frederic; Hakime, Antoine; de Baere, Thierry",Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,4,12

As we gain experience managing COVID-19, more data become available on disease severity, course, and treatment in patients infected with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, data in pregnancy remains limited. This narrative review of COVID-19 during pregnancy underscores key knowledge gaps in our understanding of the impact of this viral infection on reproductive health. Current data suggest that pregnant people have similar disease course and outcomes compared to nonpregnant people, with the majority experiencing mild disease, however pregnant people may have increased risk of hospitalization and intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Among patients who develop severe and critical disease, major maternal morbidity and mortality have been described including cardiomyopathy, mechanical ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and death. Many questions remain regarding maternal severity of disease in COVID-19. Further research is needed to better understand disease course in pregnancy. Additionally, the inclusion of pregnant patients in therapeutic trials will provide vital data on treatment options for patients.

IFITM3 prevents endocytosed virus particles from accessing the host cytoplasm although little is known regarding its regulatory mechanisms. Here we demonstrate that IFITM3 localization to and antiviral remodeling of endolysosomes is differentially regulated by S-palmitoylation and lysine ubiquitination. Although S-palmitoylation enhances IFITM3 membrane affinity and antiviral activity, ubiquitination decreases localization with endolysosomes and decreases antiviral activity. Interestingly, autophagy reportedly induced by IFITM3 expression is also negatively regulated by ubiquitination. However, the canonical ATG5-dependent autophagy pathway is not required for IFITM3 activity, indicating that virus trafficking from endolysosomes to autophagosomes is not a prerequisite for influenza virus restriction. Our characterization of IFITM3 ubiquitination sites also challenges the dual-pass membrane topology predicted for this protein family. We thus evaluated topology by N-linked glycosylation site insertion and protein lipidation mapping in conjunction with cellular fractionation and fluorescence imaging. Based on these studies, we propose that IFITM3 is predominantly an intramembrane protein where both the N and C termini face the cytoplasm. In sum, by characterizing S-palmitoylation and ubiquitination of IFITM3, we have gained a better understanding of the trafficking, activity, and intramembrane topology of this important IFN-induced effector protein.","Yount, Jacob S; Karssemeijer, Roos A; Hang, Howard C",The Journal of biological chemistry,4,1

METHODS Of 50 women who underwent a rectocele repair from March 2005 to February 2007, 26 women (group A) received a transanal repair, and 24 (group B) received a transvaginal repair with or without levatorplasty. At 12 months after the procedures, 45 (group A/B, 22/23 women) among the 50 women completed physiologic studies, including anal manometry and defecography, and clinical-outcome measurements. The variations of the clinical outcomes with changes in the depth of the rectocele were also evaluated in 42 women (group A/B, 20/22) at the median follow-up of 50 months. RESULTS On the defecographic findings, the postoperative depth of the rectocele decreased significantly in both groups (group A vs. B, 1.91 ± 0.20 vs. 2.25 ± 0.46, P = 0.040). At 12 months after surgery, 17 women in each group (group A/B, 77/75%) reported improvement of their symptoms. However, only 11 and 13 women (group A/B, 55/59%) of groups A and B, respectively, maintained their improvement at the median follow-up of 50 months. Better results were reported in patients with a greater change in the depth of their rectocele (≥4 cm) after the procedure (P = 0.001) CONCLUSION In both procedures, clinical outcomes might become progressively worse as the length of the follow-up is increased.","Chung, Choon Sik; Yu, Sang Hwa; Lee, Jeong Eun; Lee, Dong Keun",Journal of the Korean Society of Coloproctology,4,33

UK television celebrity Jade Goody died from cervical cancer in 2009. We investigated the impact of her illness on media coverage of cervical cancer prevention, health information seeking behaviour and cervical screening coverage. METHODS National UK newspaper articles containing the words 'Jade Goody' and 'cancer' were examined for public health messages. Google Insights for Search was used to quantify Internet searches as a measure of public health information seeking. Cervical screening coverage data were examined for temporal associations with this story. RESULTS Of 1203 articles, 116 (9.6%) included a clear public health message. The majority highlighted screening (8.2%). Fewer articles provided advice about vaccination (3.0%), number of sexual partners (1.4%), smoking (0.6%) and condom use (0.4%). Key events were associated with increased Internet searches for 'cervical cancer' and 'smear test', although only weakly with searches for 'HPV'. Cervical screening coverage increased during this period. CONCLUSION Increased public interest in disease prevention can follow a celebrity diagnosis. Although media coverage sometimes included public health information, articles typically focused on secondary instead of primary prevention. There is further potential to maximize the public health benefit of future celebrity diagnoses.","Metcalfe, D; Price, C; Powell, J",Journal of public health,4,1

This has been exacerbated with the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic. The use of digital pathology and whole slide imaging (WSI) as an educational tool for distance teaching is underutilised and not fully exploited. This paper highlights the utility and feedback on the use of WSI for distance education/teaching. MATERIALS AND METHODS Building on an existing relationship with the University of the West Indies (UWI), pathologists at University Health Network, Toronto, provided distance education using WSI, a digitised slide image hosting repository and videoconferencing facilities to provide case-based teaching to 15 UWI pathology trainees. Feedback was obtained from residents via a questionnaire and from teachers via a discussion. RESULTS There was uniform support from teachers who felt that teaching was not hampered by the 'virtual' engagement. Comfort levels grew with each engagement and technical issues with sound diminished with the use of a portable speaker. The residents were very supportive and enthusiastic in embracing this mode of teaching. While technical glitches marred initial sessions, the process evened out especially when the slide hosting facility, teleconferencing and sound issues were changed. CONCLUSIONS There was unanimous endorsement that use of WSI was the future, especially for distance teaching. However, it was not meant to supplant the use of glass slides in their current routine, daily practice.","Evans, Andrew John; Depeiza, Nadia; Allen, Shara-Gaye; Fraser, Kimone; Shirley, Suzanne; Chetty, Runjan",Journal of clinical pathology,4,1

Several studies from China have recently provided the evidence of epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and outcomes of COVID-19 patients. Investigation on the role of chest CT in patient screening and management course in a large cohort remains paucity. Methods This was a retrospective observational study based on the data collected between January 19 and 2020 to February 15, 2020. A clinic workflow using chest CT and RT-PCR assay to screen suspected patient was reviewed. Clinical data were evaluated and patients were classified to mild, common, severe and critical group. Chest CT characteristics of each patient were evaluated and a CT scoring system was applied to grade the lung involvement. Results Of 98 enrolled patients, 1, 29, 51 and 17 were clinically classified into mild, common, severe and critical group, respectively. Eighty-three patients (84.7%) demonstrated ground-glass opacity (GGO), 76 patients (77.5%) demonstrated consolidation and 18 patients (18.4%) demonstrated crazy-paving pattern on chest CT. Based on the CT scoring, 2, 35, 55 and 6 patients were categorized to grade 0, grade 1, grade 2 and grade 3, respectively, which significantly consistent with clinical classification (kappa =0.638, P﹤0.05). Twenty-nine patients admitted from fever clinic, with an average interval of 1.2 days (range, 0-4 days) between CT examination and onset of symptom. Three of these patients had negative initial RT-PCR result while abnormalities displayed on the initial chest CT. Conclusions Peripheral lung distributed GGO and consolidation, without subpleural sparing, are the most common manifestations on chest CT of COVID-19. Abnormalities on chest CT can occur in an early stage of COVID-19, even when RT-PCR assay negative, which may help to early recognition and rapid diagnosis of this disease.","Zhou, Hua; Xu, Kaijin; Shen, Yihong; Fang, Qiang; Chen, Feng; Sheng, Jifang; Zhao, Feng; Lou, Haiyan",Annals of translational medicine,4,31

Long non-protein-coding RNAs may possess significant cellular functions. Plasmacytoma variant translocation 1 (PVT1), a long non-coding RNA encoded by the human PVT1 gene, is an oncogene, which can regulate several tumor-related genes. In PCa, the function and mechanism of PVT1 are unclear. NOP2 is being pursued as a prognostic marker for cancer aggressiveness, which promotes mouse fibroblast growth and tumor formation. Essentially, nothing is known about the specific interactions between the PVT1 and NOP2. Methods 190 pairs of PCa tissues and adjacent normal tissues were collected and RNA sequencing was used to identify the differential lncRNAs. Real-time quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) confirmed these results and gene regulatory relationship. Lentiviral vectors were used to alter PVT1 and genes to analyze their effects on PCa progression. Transwell migration and invasion assays were performed to test the metastasis ability. Biofunction of PVT1 and NOP2 were confirmed in vitro and in vivo. Results In this study, we reported that the long noncoding RNA-PVT1 was upregulated in PCa metastasis tissues and promoted migration of PCa cells in vitro and their metastasis in vivo. High levels of PVT1 significantly downregulated tumor suppressor microRNAs (miRNAs), such as miR-15b-5p, miR-27a-3p, miR-143-3p, and miR-627-5p, whose levels in metastasis tissues were low compared to those in non-metastasis tissues. In vitro and in vivo, PVT1 promotes PCa metastasis via targeting miRNAs. Furthermore, the expression level of PVT1 was positively associated with the expression of NOP2, a cancer metastasis-related protein. We demonstrated that NOP2 promoted invasion and migration of PCa. For specific mechanism, correlation analysis showed that PVT1 promoted metastasis by up-regulating NOP2. Conclusion Taken together, our results show that PVT1 acts as an inducer of PCa metastasis via targeting miRNAs, thereby promoting NOP2. This axis may have diagnostic and therapeutic potential for advanced PCa.","Sun, Feng; Wu, Ke; Yao, Zhixian; Mu, Xingyu; Zheng, Zhong; Sun, Menghao; Wang, Yong; Liu, Zhihong; Zhu, Yiyong",OncoTargets and therapy,4,26

The Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) checklist for DSM-5, Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21, Brief Resilience Scale, and the Stressful Life Events List resulting from the pandemic were administered to the participants. RESULTS There were not significantly differences between the AV patients and the control group in terms of depression, anxiety, stress, psychological resilience levels, and experienced stressful life events. Probable PTSD rate was significantly higher for AV patients (16.4%) than the control groups (9.5%) (p = 0.040). High levels of depression and anxiety, low psychological resilience, and high levels in experienced traumatic life events predicted high severity in PTSD symptoms, whereas low psychological resilience predicted high levels of depression, anxiety, and stress in AV patients.

Thus, RNA cap methylation is an attractive target for antiviral discovery and development of new live attenuated vaccines. For coronaviruses, RNA cap structure is first methylated at guanine N-7 (G-N-7) position by nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14), which facilitates and precedes the subsequent ribose 2'-O methylation by nsp16-nsp10 complex. Using porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), an Alphacoronavirus, as a model, we showed that G-N-7 methyltransferase (G-N-7 MTase) of PEDV nsp14 methylated RNA substrates in a sequence-unspecific manner. PEDV nsp14 can efficiently methylate RNA substrates with various lengths in both neutral and alkaline pH environment, and can methylate cap analogs (GpppA and GpppG) and single nucleotide GTP but not ATP, CTP, or UTP. Mutations to the S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) binding motif in the nsp14 abolished the G-N-7 MTase activity and were lethal to PEDV. However, recombinant rPEDV-D350A with a single mutation (D350A) in nsp14, which retained 29.0% of G-N-7 MTase activity, was viable. Recombinant rPEDV-D350A formed significantly smaller plaque and had significant defects in viral protein synthesis and viral replication in Vero CCL-81 cells and intestinal porcine epithelial cells (IPEC-DQ) cells. Notably, rPEDV-D350A induced significantly higher expression of both type I and III interferons in IPEC-DQ cells compared to the parental rPEDV. Collectively, our results demonstrate that G-N-7 MTase activity of PEDV modulates viral replication, gene expression, and innate immune responses.IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses (CoVs) include a wide range of important human and animal pathogens. Examples of human CoVs include severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-1), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and the most recently emerged SARS-CoV-2. Examples of pig CoVs include porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), and swine enteric alphacoronavirus (SeACoV). There are no vaccines or antiviral drugs for most of these viruses. All known CoVs encode a bifunctional nsp14 protein which possesses ExoN and G-N-7 MTase activities, responsible for replication fidelity and RNA cap G-N-7 methylation, respectively. Here, we biochemically characterized G-N-7 MTase of PEDV nsp14 and found that G-N-7 MTase-deficient PEDV was defective in replication and induced higher type I and III interferons. These findings highlight that CoV G-N-7 MTase may be a novel target for rational design of live attenuated vaccines and antiviral drugs.","Lu, Yunjian; Cai, Hui; Lu, Mijia; Ma, Yuanmei; Li, Anzhong; Gao, Youling; Zhou, Jiyong; Gu, Howard; Li, Jianrong; Gu, Jinyan",Journal of virology,4,23

We evaluated its prognostic value in a large heterogeneous cohort of patients with extensive hepatic malignancy. METHODS A total of 122 patients with primary or secondary liver malignancy (18 different cell types) underwent SPECT imaging after intraarterial injection of (99m)Tc macroaggregated albumin (TcMAA) as a simulation of subsequent (90)Y microsphere distribution, followed by administration of an excess of intravenous (99m)Tc-labelled sulphur colloid (TcSC) as a biomarker for functional liver, and a second SPECT scan. TcMAA distribution was used to estimate (90)Y radiation absorbed dose in tumour (D T) and in functional liver. Laboratory and clinical follow-up were recorded for 12 weeks after RE, and radiographic responses according to (m)RECIST were evaluated at 3 and 6 months. Dose-response relationships were determined for efficacy and toxicity. RESULTS Patients were treated with a median of 1.73 GBq activity of resin microspheres (98 patients) or glass microspheres (24 patients), in a whole-liver approach (97 patients) or a lobar approach (25 patients). The objective response rate was 41% at 3 months and 48% at 6 months. Response was correlated with D T (P < 0.01). Median overall survival was 10.1 months (95% confidence interval 7.4 - 12.8 months). Responders lived for 36.0 months compared to 8.7 months for nonresponders (P < 0.01). Stratified for tumour cell type, D T was independently associated with survival (P < 0.01). Absorbed dose in functional liver was correlated with toxicity grade change (P < 0.05) and RE-induced liver disease (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION Fusion dual-tracer SPECT imaging offers a physiology-based functional imaging tool to predict efficacy and toxicity of RE. This technique can be refined to define dosing thresholds for specific tumour types and treatments, but appears generally predictive even in a heterogeneous cohort.","Lam, Marnix G E H; Banerjee, Arjun; Goris, Michael L; Iagaru, Andrei H; Mittra, Erik S; Louie, John D; Sze, Daniel Y",European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging,4,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS Normozoospermic semen samples were used to validate the co-staining consisting of Acridine Orange (AO) and LIVE/DEAD™ Fixable Blue Dead Cell Stain (LD), against established methods for the evaluation of cell viability, propidium iodide stain (PI), and DNA fragmentation, the Sperm Chromatin Structure Assay (SCSA), to rule out cross-interference. Furthermore, the accuracy of the method was tested by the evaluation of samples prepared with different amounts of membrane and DNA damage (20, 40, 60, 80, and 100%). RESULTS No significant differences were observed between the co-staining and the established staining procedures (membrane integrity, P = 0.755; DNA fragmentation P = 0.976). Moreover, high R square values were obtained from the analysis of samples of known membrane (R2 = 0.9959) and DNA damage (R2 = 0.9843). The simultaneous assaying of sperm membrane integrity and nuclear DNA fragmentation allowed the analysis of four sperm categories and thereby to assess the proportion of membrane-intact spermatozoa with compromised DNA integrity. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION This new protocol has the potential to provide clinically relevant information about the DNA fragmentation in membrane-intact spermatozoa. Thus it has the potential of improving the diagnostic of male infertility and enabling a better understanding of sperm dysfunction.","Da Costa, Raul; Redmann, Klaus; Schlatt, Stefan",Andrology,4,16

Few cases have been reported to date. In most cases, chylous ascites is diagnosed within 1 month after surgery because of intraoperative injury of the hilar lymphatic system. Preoperative massive ascites and use of a LigaSure vessel sealing system for hilar dissection have been reported as risk factors. We report a case of chylous ascites after a living-donor liver transplant that was diagnosed after 6 months of uneventful follow-up. Sirolimus was added to cyclosporine early (2 wk after the operation) owing to poor renal function and it was found to be high (> 22 ng/mL) when the chylous ascites occurred. The patient was treated with total parenteral nutrition in combination with Sandostatin and rapid tapering of sirolimus after the failed initial conservative treatment. Residual abdominal fullness after meals and lymphedema of the legs disappeared 1 month after discontinuing sirolimus.

Probiotics consist of single or mixed cultures of live microorganisms that can beneficially affect the host by maintaining the intestinal or lung microbiota that play a major role in human health. At present, good scientific evidence exists to support the ability of probiotics to boost human immunity, thereby preventing colonization by pathogens and reducing the incidence and severity of infections. Herein, we present clinical studies of the use of probiotic supplementation to prevent or treat respiratory tract infections. These data lead to promising benefits of probiotics in reducing the risk of COVID-19.

Among these, COVID-19 has greater transmission and mortality rate. 2019 nCoV belongs to a large family of positive sense single-stranded RNA viruses (+ssRNA) that can be isolated in different animal species. The most communal symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough, and shortness of breath during the incubation period (2-14 days) of infection. COVID-19 transmission is occurring from infected humans to close contact with one another through respiratory droplets, coughs, and sneezes of infected person. Moreover, the virus containing surfaces may also transmit the infection. Diagnosis is being carried out by collecting a nasopharyngeal swab or sputum specimen for detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Rapid diagnosing methods are also under development which can diagnose COVID 19 in few minutes to hours. Currently, there is no specific cure or preventive therapeutics available. Hence, based upon limited in-vitro and anecdotal data, Chloroquine, or Hydroxychloroquine, Remdesivir, Lopinavir and Ritonavir are being employed in the management. Search for new specific anti-viral drugs from natural/synthetic origins is under full swing and many of them are currently used as chemotherapeutic drugs under clinical investigation.

In all other cell types and tissues, FAT10 expression is highly inducible by the pro-inflammatory cytokines interferon (IFN)-γ and tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Besides ubiquitin, FAT10 is the only ULM which directly targets its substrates for degradation by the 26S proteasome. This poses the question as to why two ULMs sharing the proteasome-targeting function have evolved and how they differ from each other. This Review summarizes the current knowledge of the special structure of FAT10 and highlights its differences from ubiquitin.

The present study was undertaken to assess the therapeutic response of TCZ therapy in severely or critically ill COVID-19 patients and its role as an effective modality of management. Methods: The present retrospective observational study included 30 admitted severely or critically ill COVID-19 patients, treated with TCZ therapy on behalf of raised IL-6 levels. The patients' data concerning medical history, clinical manifestation, arterial blood gas analysis, mode of oxygenation, radiological imaging, and outcome were extracted from their medical records and compared pre- and post-TCZ infusion. Results: All patients of the study group had symptomatic presentations with a mean PaO2/FiO2 (P/F) ratio of 205.41 before TCZ infusion. All patients had a raised IL-6 level (mean value 206.56 pg/mL) that was extremely elevated in 90% of patients. Infusion of TCZ dramatically reduced mean body temperature (100.78-99.32°F) and the requirement for supplemental oxygen (68-48%) and improved mean SpO2 (86-89%) and mean P/F ratio (208-240) within 24 hours. Three patients on noninvasive ventilation were weaned off after TCZ infusion. Serum levels of IL-6 were raised initially but declined within 3-5 days of post-TCZ infusion. Conclusion: TCZ appears to be an effective therapeutic option in severely or critically ill COVID-19 patients with raised IL-6 levels. TCZ immediately improves the clinical status of patients by a probable mechanism of inhibition of cytokine storm and reduces COVID-19-related mortalities.

Personnel and providers from 68 organizations from 34 US states responded. While half of the organizations did not yet have formal allocation policies, all but 4 were in the process of developing policies.

All but 1 policy referenced a sequential organ failure assessment score as a triage criterion, and 10 policies categorically excluded patients. Six policies were almost identical, tracing their origins to influenza planning. This sample of policies reflects organizational strategies of exemplar-based policy development and the use of objective criteria in triage decisions, either before or instead of clinical judgment, to support ethical distribution of resources.

Cataract surgery is an efficacious intervention that usually restores vision. Although it is one of the most commonly conducted surgical interventions worldwide, good quality services (from being detected with operable cataract to undergoing surgery and receiving postoperative care) are not universally accessible. Poor quality understandably reduces the willingness of people with operable cataract to undergo surgery. Therefore, it is critical to improve the quality of care to subsequently reduce vision loss from cataract. This scoping review aims to summarise the nature and extent of the published literature on interventions to improve the quality of services for primary age-related cataract globally. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will search MEDLINE, Embase and Global Health for peer-reviewed manuscripts published since 1990, with no language, geographic or study design restrictions. To define quality, we have used the elements adopted by the WHO-effectiveness, safety, people-centredness, timeliness, equity, integration and efficiency-to which we have added the element of planetary health. We will exclude studies focused on the technical aspects of the surgical procedure and studies that only involve children (<18 years). Two reviewers will screen all titles/abstracts independently, followed by a full-text review of potentially relevant articles.

Various community-training programmes have improved practices like bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and early defibrillation using automated external defibrillator (AED). Post-resuscitation care has also changed significantly in the millennium. Interventions like targeted temperature management (TTM), avoidance of hyperoxia and emergency cardiac catheterisation have given patients a chance of a better neurological outcome. Despite these timely interventions, it is still very difficult to predict neurological outcome. The European Resuscitation Council and European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ERC-ESICM) published guidance in 2015 with a strong recommendation to delay prognostication for at least 72 h and with an emphasis to adapt a multimodal approach, which includes neurological examination, biomarkers, electroencephalogram (EEG) and radiological tests. These interventions not only have cost attached to them, but the unpredictability has a significant emotional impact on family members. Bispectral index (BIS) monitoring device acts on the principle of EEG and converts the waveform into an absolute number and also measures the burst suppression. We hypothesize that patients who have a low BIS value and high burst suppression within 24 h of presentation will have a poor neurological outcome. The primary objective of this review is to look at BIS monitor as a tool, which could help bring forward the timing of prognostication. METHODS Electronic databases will be systematically searched for randomised controlled trials and prospective or retrospective cohort studies with no language restrictions. The search will be supplemented with grey literature searches of thesis, dissertations and hand searching of relevant journals. Two independent reviewers will screen, select and perform analysis according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) method. The selected studies will be analysed using the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system. Meta-analysis will be performed if suitable. DISCUSSION This review will synthesize the evidence on the use of BIS monitors within 24 h of achieving return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and may help in early prognostication.

Research suggests ACP discussions among persons living with HIV (PLHIV) are infrequent overall and may differ by gender and/or race. BACKGROUND Previous literature has displayed that African Americans are less likely than other racial groups to use advanced care planning, palliative care or hospice, but does not conclusively account for ACP among PLHIV. African American PLHIV rely on informal care that may be differ by gender and represents an important pathway to increase ACP. DESIGN The study was mixed methods and observational. METHODS Participants completed self-report surveys (N = 311) and were interviewed (n = 11). Poisson regression (quantitative) and grounded theory analyses (qualitative) were implemented, using COREQ checklist principles to ensure study rigor. RESULTS Less than half had discussed ACP (41.2%; N = 267). More ACP knowledge predicted 76% lower likelihood of ACP discussions among women. Men who spent more time caregiving in a given week were nearly 3 times more likely to discuss ACP than men who spent less time caregiving. Women were more likely than men to be caregivers and were also expected to serve in that role more than men, which was qualitatively described as 'being a woman'. CONCLUSIONS The present study is one of few studies exploring ACP among caregivers in African American populations hardest hit by HIV. Results suggest that ACP skill building and education are critical for African Americans living with HIV to promote ACP discussions with their caregivers. Knowledge about ACP topics was low overall even when healthcare had recently been accessed. Support reciprocity and gender-specific communication skill building may facilitate ACP in African American HIV informal caregiving relationships. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE Results underscore the need for ACP education which includes healthcare providers and caregivers, given African Americans' preference for life-sustaining treatments at end-of-life. ACP is crucial now more than ever, as COVID-19 complicates care for older adults with HIV at high risk of complications.","Maragh-Bass, Allysha C; Hendricks Sloan, Danetta; Aimone, Elizabeth V; Knowlton, Amy R",Journal of clinical nursing,4,30

Many factors have swayed the public's perception of this coronavirus and the new vaccinations, including misinformation, heightened emotions, and the divisive and tumultuous partisan climate. As such, vaccine hesitancy may be more prevalent for the COVID-19 vaccine than others. Healthcare workers are trusted sources of information and have the opportunity to influence an individual's choice to take the vaccine. For those who initially present as unwilling to be vaccinated, trying to persuade them with facts and scare tactics may cause more resistance. By using the communication approach of motivational interviewing, practitioners can support autonomy to reduce defensiveness, use a guiding style to elicit ambivalence and provide information, address personal agency to ensure that their patients understand that their efforts can reduce risk, and evoke a person's own argument for vaccination to decrease vaccine hesitancy.","Gabarda, Amanda; Butterworth, Susan W",Health promotion practice,4,17

Two research groups independently identified a novel negative-strand RNA virus, now designated avian bornavirus (ABV), in parrots with proventricular dilatation disease (PDD), a severe lymphoplasmacytic ganglioneuritis of the gastrointestinal tract of psittacine birds that is frequently accompanied by encephalomyelitis. Since its discovery, ABV has been detected worldwide in many captive parrots and in one canary with PDD. ABV induced a PDD-like disease in experimentally infected cockatiels, strongly suggesting that ABV is highly pathogenic in psittacine birds. Until the discovery of ABV, the Bornaviridae family consisted of a single species, classical Borna disease virus (BDV), which is the causative agent of a progressive neurological disorder that affects primarily horses, sheep, and some other farm animals in central Europe. Although ABV and BDV share many biological features, there exist several interesting differences, which are discussed in this review.","Staeheli, Peter; Rinder, Monika; Kaspers, Bernd",Journal of virology,4,1

Previous studies have shown that methanogenic Archaea can generate CH4 when incubated with perchlorates, highly oxidizing chaotropic salts which have been found across the Martian surface. However, the regulatory mechanisms behind this remain completely unexplored. In this study we performed comparative transcriptomics on the methanogen Methanosarcina barkeri, which was incubated at 30˚C and 0˚C with 10-20 mM calcium-, magnesium-, or sodium perchlorate. Consistent with prior studies, we observed decreased CH4 production and apparent perchlorate reduction, with the latter process proceeding by heretofore essentially unknown mechanisms. Transcriptomic responses of M. barkeri to perchlorates include up-regulation of osmoprotectant transporters and selection against redox-sensitive amino acids. Increased expression of methylamine methanogenesis genes suggest competition for H2 with perchlorate reduction, which we propose is catalyzed by up-regulated molybdenum-containing enzymes and maintained by siphoning diffused H2 from energy-conserving hydrogenases. Methanogenesis regulatory patterns suggest Mars' freezing temperatures alone pose greater constraints to CH4 production than perchlorates. These findings increase our understanding of methanogen survival in extreme environments and confers continued consideration of a potential biological contribution to Martian CH4.","Harris, Rachel L; Schuerger, Andrew C; Wang, Wei; Tamama, Yuri; Garvin, Zachary K; Onstott, Tullis C",Scientific reports,4,17

Although researchers have carried out a lot of research on 2019-nCoV, analyzed the molecular structure and conducted evolutionary tree analysis, there is still insufficient understanding of its specific pathogenic mechanism, resulting in the lack of specific and effective therapeutic drugs and method. 2019-nCoV infection can cause inflammation and may deteriorate to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and sepsis, which have become the main complication of its death. Therefore, using antiviral and symptomatic treatment with inflammation reduction can have a better therapeutic effect. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) not only have a significant immune-regulation function, but also play a role in regeneration and repair, repairing damaged lungs, so they can be considered as a new effective method for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This article analyzes the main pathogenic mechanism of 2019-nCoV, and the process of developing into ARDS, combined with the research status of MSCs, to explore its significance and feasibility for the treatment of COVID-19.

Machine learning has great potential for prediction, but few studies apply the approaches of deep learning to forecast the quantity of MSW. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and practicability of employing the methods of supervised learning, including Attention, one-dimension Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to predict the MSW Amount in Shanghai. Integrated 1D-CNN and LSTM with Attention model, the new structure model (1D-CNN-LSTM-Attention, 1D-CLA), is designed to forecast MSW amount. In addition, the influence of socioeconomic factors on MSW amount, the structure and layers distribution of Attention, 1D-CNN, LSTM and 1D-CLA are also discussed. The results indicate that the correlation coefficients of Attention, one-dimension CNN, LSTM, and proposed 1D-CLA model to predict the MSW in Shanghai are 78%, 86.6%, 90%, and 95.3%, respectively, suggesting the feasible and practicable. The values of 24, 0.01, 50 and 25 for the number of neurons, dropout, the value of epoch number and Batch size best fit 1D-CLA to predict the amount of MSW in Shanghai. Furthermore, the performance of 1D-CLA is better than any single model or two model's combination (R2 is 95.3%) and the mechanism of 1D-CLA is contributed by three former models following the order: LSTM>CNN>Attention.","Lin, Kunsen; Zhao, Youcai; Tian, Lu; Zhao, Chunlong; Zhang, Meilan; Zhou, Tao",The Science of the total environment,4,33

This report describes our initial experience with a hybrid laparoscopic and transanal endoscopic technique for TME in low rectal cancer. METHODS Between December 2012 and October 2013, we identified patients with rectal cancer < 5 cm from the anorectal junction (ARJ) who underwent laparoscopic-assisted TME with a transanal minimally invasive surgery (TAMIS) technique. A standardized stepwise approach was used in all patients. Resection specimens were examined for completeness and measurement of margins. Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) characteristics and short-term postoperative outcomes were examined. All values are mean ± standard deviation. RESULTS Ten patients (8 males; median age: 60.5 (range 36-70) years) were included. On initial MRI, all tumors were T2 or T3, mean tumor height from the ARJ was 28.9 ± 12.2 mm, mean circumferential resection margin was 5.3 ± 3.1 mm , and the mean angle between the anal canal and the levator ani was 83.9° ± 9.7°. All patients had had preoperative chemoradiotherapy, TME via TAMIS, and distal anastomosis. There were no intraoperative complications, anastomotic leaks, or 30-day mortality. The pathologic quality of all mesorectal specimens was excellent. The distal resection margin was 19.4 ± 10.4 mm, the mean circumferential resection margin was 13.8 ± 5.1 mm, and the median lymph node harvest was 10.5 (range 5-15) nodes. CONCLUSIONS A combined laparoscopic and transanal approach can achieve a safe and oncologically complete TME dissection for low rectal tumors. This approach may improve clinical outcomes in these technically difficult cases, but larger prospective studies are needed.","Knol, J J; D'Hondt, M; Souverijns, G; Heald, B; Vangertruyden, G",Techniques in coloproctology,4,16

We rigorously tested the link between caffeinated soda intake and the neurocognitive functions by applying machine learning and hierarchical linear regression to a large dataset from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study (N=3,966; age=9-10 years). The results showed that daily consumption of caffeinated soda in children was associated with impaired working memory and higher impulsivity, and increased amygdala activation during the emotional working memory task.

This study aims to explore these drivers and barriers from the perspective of hotel managers and involve a range of hotels with different hotel industry profiles and management structures.Design/methodology/approachThe study conducted one-on-one interviews with hotel managers to explore the barriers to and drivers of ESPPs. The purpose of the sample and sample size was to ensure representation of different segments of the hotel industry to include international chain affiliated hotels, Australian chain affiliated hotels and independent hotels.FindingsAn analysis of the findings suggests that the major barriers to implementing and sustaining environmental sustainability in the Australian hotel industry are time, financial challenges, availability of resources and the views and imperatives of hotel owners and shareholders. The major drivers are financial, marketing, owner and shareholder interests and guest preferences. These stakeholders play a major role in creating both barriers and drivers.Research limitations/implicationsBased on the results, this study can modify the application of stakeholder theory to a degree and argue that stakeholders need to co-operate further to drive sustainability. This study demonstrates that management of environmental sustainability is a challenge for many hotels and there is a particular need for small and independent hotels to embrace environmental sustainability to keep pace with their larger counterparts.Originality/valueThis study is broadly informed by the stakeholder theory. Owners, shareholders and associated stakeholders have a significant influence over environmental sustainability in the Australian hotel industry and they create both drivers and barriers.

This focus, however, may lead us to overlook a bigger threat to Eastern European democracy. We argue that Eastern European democracies' original sin of state capture has been exacerbated by the rise of conspiracy theories, whose stock has only increased with the addition of COVID misinformation. Eastern European voters struggle to differentiate between the true political conspiracy that enables private interests to control the state and conspiracies without empirical basis, such as COVID denialism, world government, or political correctness as a tyrannical plot. As a result, conspiracy theories enable the state capture camp to divide the reformist opposition and maintain their grip, while simultaneously claiming that they are governing competently and in line with European values. We use an original survey from Bulgaria and a GLOBSEC 2020 cross-national survey to explore this hypothesis. Finally, we draw some theoretical implications from the empirical evidence for assessing the nature of democratic backsliding in Eastern Europe. We call for more research on the conspiracy cleavage as a factor in explaining backsliding processes. © The Author(s), 2021.

By drawing on feminist democracy theory, it shows the interdependent connections of democracy and gender equality in the analysed European crises. It examines the two dimensions of the double democratic deficit through gender lens -the underrepresentation of women and gender sensitivity- in the adoption and provisions of the Treaty of I,isbon and European decision-making and responses to the crises. It argues that the gender-blind European responses to the crises of the first decade of the Treaty of Lisbon have contributed -among other factors- to the deterioration of the EU's democratic structures and procedures, and have also, in turn, contributed to restraining progress on gender equality and exacerbating gender inequality across different member states. Given Ursula Von der Leyen's declared plans for a ""new push for European democracy"", and the new EU crisis emerged by the Covid-19 virus pandemic, the article points to some key gender aspects that might be worth considering for the future of the European democratic project.","Irigoien, A.",Politica Y Sociedad,4,1

The evolutionary relationships between host species can explain variation in transmission rates, virulence, and virus community composition between hosts, but the potential for different viruses to interact with host species effects has yet to be established. Here, we measure correlations in viral load of four Cripavirus isolates across experimental infections of 45 Drosophilidae host species. We find positive correlations between every pair of viruses tested, suggesting that broadly susceptible host clades could act as reservoirs and donors for certain types of viruses. Additionally, we find evidence of genotype-by-genotype interactions between viruses and host species, highlighting the importance of both host and virus traits in determining the outcome of virus host shifts. More closely related viruses tended to be more strongly correlated, providing tentative evidence that virus evolutionary relatedness may be a useful proxy for determining the likelihood of novel virus emergence, which warrants further research. Impact Summary Many new infectious diseases are caused by viruses jumping into novel host species. Estimating the probability that jumps will occur, what the characteristics of new viruses will be, and how they are likely to evolve after jumping to new host species are major challenges. To solve these challenges, we require a detailed understanding of the interactions between different viruses and hosts, or metrics that can capture some of the variation in these interactions. Previous studies have shown that the evolutionary relationships between host species can be used to predict traits of infections in different hosts, including transmission rates and the damage caused by infection. However, the potential for different viruses to influence the patterns of these host species effects has yet to be determined. Here, we use four viruses of insects in experimental infections across 45 different fruit fly host species to begin to answer this question. We find similarities in the patterns of replication and persistence between all four viruses, suggesting susceptible groups of related hosts could act as reservoirs and donors for certain types of virus. However, we also find evidence that different virus genotypes interact in different ways with some host species. Viruses that were more closely related tended to behave in similar ways, and so we suggest that virus evolutionary relatedness may prove to be a useful metric for predicting the traits of novel infections and should be explored further in future studies.","Imrie, Ryan M.; Roberts, Katherine E.; Longdon, Ben",bioRxiv,4,13

An autoethnography is presented as a personal narrative that focused on a specific event in life.FindingsThe author found that gaining awareness of how resistance to change manifests itself in the early stages of transition allows us to move forward, rather than remaining “stuck in transition”. Furthermore, the author found that transition cycles can be looped;in other words, we find ourselves starting transition anew if circumstances change again. Thus, transition should not be seen as linear but cyclical.Practical implicationsThis research could be useful to other accounting academics by fostering an awareness of individual change-responses during times of crisis, thereby enabling better self-management of change. For heads of accountancy academic departments, it is important to take note that change amidst crisis can sap morale and diminish work performance. The management of staff, and understanding their transition change-responses during crisis, is therefore critical to ensure that staff are navigated through change arising from crisis.Originality/valueThis paper answers the question what can we learn by understanding our transitional process of change by drawing on change theory? To this end, this paper presents and starts this conversation, through a personal narrative bringing to life the transitional change journey of an accounting academic during crisis. This study lays a foundation for further empirical and theoretical enquiry into accounting education change processes during crisis.","Ackermann, Christo",Accounting Research Journal,4,5

Methods: HCWs of the system were retrospectively included from the beginning of a COVID-19 vaccination program (December 16, 2020) until March 31, 2021. Those with a prior COVID-19 infection before December 15 were excluded. The Occupational Health department of the system ran a COVID-19 screening and testing referral program for workers, consistently throughout the study period. A master database had been established and updated comprising of the demographics, COVID-19 PCR assays, and vaccinations of each HCW. Andersen-Gill extension of the Cox models were built to estimate the VE of fully/partially vaccinated person-days at risk. Results: Among the 4317 eligible HCWs, 3249 (75%) received any vaccination during the study period. Vaccinated HCWs were older, less likely to be Black/African American, Hispanic/Latino or identify as two or more races, and more likely to be medical providers. After adjusting for age, sex, race, and the statewide background incidence at the time of vaccination, we observed a VE of 80.2% (95% CI: 57.5-90.8%) for [greater double equals]14 days after the first dose of Pfizer/Moderna, and 95.5% (95% CI: 88.2-98.3%) among those fully vaccinated (i.e. [greater double equals]14 days after the second dose of Pfizer/Moderna or the single dose of J&J/Janssen). Conclusion: COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness in the real world is promising, and these data in concert with culturally appropriate may decrease vaccine hesitancy.","Iliaki, E.; Lan, F.-Y.; Christophi, C.

The effects on NO$_2$ and aerosols have been very noticeable and readily demonstrated, but that on light pollution has proven challenging to determine. The main reason for this difficulty is that the primary source of nighttime satellite imagery of the earth is the SNPP-VIIRS/DNB instrument, which acquires data late at night after most human nocturnal activity has already occurred and much associated lighting has been turned off. Here, to analyze the effect of lockdown on urban light emissions, we use ground and satellite data for Granada, Spain, during the COVID-19 induced confinement of the city's population from March 14 until May 31, 2020. We find a clear decrease in light pollution due both to a decrease in light emissions from the city and to a decrease in anthropogenic aerosol content in the atmosphere which resulted in less light being scattered. A clear correlation between the abundance of PM10 particles and sky brightness is observed, such that the more polluted the atmosphere the brighter the urban night sky. An empirical expression is determined that relates PM10 particle abundance and sky brightness at three different wavelength bands.","Bustamante-Calabria, M'aximo; Miguel, Alejandro S'anchez de; Mart'in-Ruiz, Susana; Ortiz, Jose-Luis; V'ilchez, J.

Drawing primarily on the writings of sociologist Robert K. Merton, the thinkers of the Vienna Circle, and Charles Sanders Peirce, I make some of these assumptions explicit by telling a longer story about the evolution of social thinking about the normative structure of science from Merton's articulation of his well-known norms (those of universalism, communism, organized skepticism, and disinterestedness) to the present. I show that while Merton's norms and his intertwinement of these with the underlying mechanisms of democratic order provide us with an especially good starting point to explore and clarify the commitments and values of science, Leonelli's broader, more context-responsive, and more holistic vision of the epistemic integrity of data scientific understanding, and her discernment of the global and biospheric scope of its moral-practical reach, move beyond Merton's schema in ways that effectively draw upon important critiques. Stepping past Merton, I argue that a combination of situated universalism, methodological pluralism, strong objectivity, and unbounded communalism must guide the responsible and sustainable data work of the future.","Leslie, David",,4,26

In the US, hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients require transfusion support until engraftment and together with hematology/oncology (hemonc.) patients receive the highest number of PCs/patient. FDA's Guidance recommends approaches to reduce BC risk including the use of enhanced bacterial culture screening (EBSC) or pathogen reduction (PR) of platelets. Methods: The Miami Cancer Institute (MCI) implemented PR-PCs for all allogeneic HSCT patients. Irradiation, CMV testing, and bacterial screening have been discontinued for PR-PCs. Transfusion outcomes are being monitored using active hemovigilance (HV) reporting. Results: Considering the fatality risk associated with BC of PCs (1:200,000 -1:1,000,000) despite the use of optimal skin cleansing, initial sample diversion, and primary bacterial culture, 1/2,880 PCs are still contaminated (Bloch et al.);further steps towards BC mitigation are needed. As the UK and US reported a residual BC risk of 5.4-9.4/million PCs after implementation of EBSC, PR may represent an alternative approach with other cumulative benefits. Indeed, national HV data from France, Switzerland and Belgium reported no sepsis transfusion reactions since PR implementation (Benjamin et al.). In addition, the risk of TA-GVHD and other TTI including emerging infectious diseases (EID) may be decreased after the inactivation of pathogens and leukocytes (Lanteri et al.). At MCI, the percentage of transfused PR-PCs has been increasing steadily from 7.9% in July 2019 to 22.2% in January 2021. Over a 19 monthperiod, a total of 9,296 PC were transfused including 1,677 PR-PCs. While non-PR-PCs were all irradiated and bacterially screened, PR-PC were neither irradiated nor bacterially screened. No cases of TA-GVHD or TTI were reported. A total of 27 mild, non-life-threatening platelet transfusion reactions were reported including 22 (81.5%) after non-PR PCs transfusion and 5 (18.5%) after PR-PC transfusion. In addition, the early release of transfusion-ready fresh PR-PCs 24-48 hours after collection has proven invaluable in providing clinicians and patients with blood continuity during the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusions: Though certain measures have improved blood safety, the risk of TTI associated with PC transfusion remains a concern for vulnerable hemonc. patients. Using PR-PC is especially important to consider when patients undergo extensive life-saving therapies such as bone marrow transplants.","Alvarez, H.; Lanteri, M.; Koehne, G.",Journal of Clinical Oncology,4,16

This disease was seen typically in the sinonasal form in COVID-19 patients. Uncontrolled diabetes, steroid use in COVID-19 treatment, etc. were some of the postulated risk factors for the association of COVID 19 and Mucormycosis. The management plan of these cases included surgical debridement, systemic antifungal therapy, sugar control, and management of antifungal related systemic adverse effects. In this retrospective case record review, we aimed to evaluate the airway management plan, demographics, and overall outcomes in patients undergoing surgical resection for COVID-19 associated mucormycosis. Forty-one (71.9 %) patients had a diagnosis of sino-nasal mucormycosis, fourteen (24.6%) had a diagnosis of rhino-orbital mucormycosis, and 2 patients (3.5%) were diagnosed with palatal mucormycosis. Total 44 (77.19 %) patients had co-morbidities. The most common co-morbidity was Diabetes Mellitus 42 (73.6%), followed by hypertension 21 (36.84%) and Acute kidney injury 14 (28.07%).

Additionally, the methods published for long-term cultures require time-consuming maintenance to generate brain organoids in large numbers. With the increasing need for human midbrain organoids (hMOs) to better understand and model Parkinson’s disease (PD) in a dish, there is a need to implement new workflows and methods to both generate and maintain hMOs, while minimizing batch to batch variation. In this study, we developed a method with microfabricated disks to scale up the generation of hMOs. This opens up the possibility to generate larger numbers of hMOs, in a manner that minimizes the amount of labor required, while decreasing variability and maintaining the viability of these hMOs over time. Taken together, producing hMOs in this manner opens up the potential for these to be used to further PD studies.","Mohamed, Nguyen-Vi; Lépine, Paula; Lacalle-Aurioles, María; Sirois, Julien; Mathur, Meghna; Reintsch, Wolfgang; Beitel, Lenore K.; Fon, Edward A.; Durcan, Thomas M.",bioRxiv,4,16

To rapidly reach herd immunity, an affordable, easy to store and versatile vaccine platform is thus desirable. We previously designed a non-infectious adenovirus-inspired nanoparticle (ADDomer), and in the present work, we efficiently decorated this original vaccine platform with glycosylated receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2. Cryo-Electron Microscopy structure revealed that up to 60 copies of this antigenic domain were bound on a single ADDomer particle with the symmetrical arrangements of a dodecahedron. Mouse immunization with the RBD decorated particles showed as early as the first immunization a significant anti-coronavirus humoral response, which was boosted after a second immunization. Neutralization assays with spike pseudo-typed-virus demonstrated the elicitation of strong neutralization titers. Remarkably, the existence of pre-existing immunity against adenoviral-derived particles enhanced the humoral response against SARS-CoV-2. This plug and play vaccine platform revisits the way of using adenovirus to combat emergent pathogens while potentially taking advantage of the adenovirus pre-immunity.","Chevillard, C; Amen, A; Besson, S; Hannani, D; Bally, I; Dettling, V; Gout, E; Moreau, CJ; Buisson, M; Gallet, S; Fenel, D; Vassal-Stermann, E; Schoehn, G; Poignard, P; Dagher, MC; Fender, P",bioRxiv,4,1

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the potential risk factor contributing to CR-POPF following distal pancreatectomy (DP) and discussed the risk factors of pancreatic fistula in order to interpret the clinical importance. All the patients who underwent DP in between January 2011 and January 2020 were reviewed retrospectively in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. The univariate and multivariate analysis was performed was performed to test an independent risk factors for pancreatic fistula. P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. In all of the 263 patients with DP, pancreatic fistula was the most common surgical complication 19.0%. The univariate analysis of 18 factors showed that the patients with a malignant tumor, soft pancreas, and patient without ligation of the main pancreatic duct are more likely to develop pancreatic fistula. However, on multivariate analysis the soft texture of the pancreas (OR= 2.381, P= 0.001) and the ligation of main pancreatic duct (OR= 0.388, P= 0.002) were only an independent influencing factor for CR-POPF. As a conclusion, pancreatic fistula was the most common surgical complication after DP, and the texture of pancreas and ligation of main pancreatic duct can influence an incidence of CR-POPF.","Wang, G.

Case overview/synopsis: The Cape Union Mart Group is a typical apparel retail company faced with the challenge of improving the digital customer experience and accelerating digital transformation in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. Due to the pandemic, the demand for e-commerce increased dramatically. However, strict lockdown regulations forbade the delivery of clothing. When the lockdown was lifted, there was an order backlog of four weeks. To add to this challenge, the Group was in the midst of a technology update. They moved their entire information technology (IT) backbone to three clouds and, just a week before the lockdown, launched five new websites for its five different retail chains. The ultimate goal with the technology update was to give the company a competitive advantage by improving the customer experience. However, having to do this at an accelerated pace due to the pandemic posed a number of challenges. The case provides a vivid description of how the crisis unfolded and how Grant De Waal-Dubla, the executive of e-commerce and IT at the Group and his team responded to the challenges, together with the marketing team. Based on the success of e-commerce during the lockdown, the owners of the business then tasked Grant with new, aggressive growth targets. Whilst dealing with the aftermath of the lockdown, Grant’s main challenge is to develop a strategy to reach those targets. Complexity academic level: The primary target audience for this case are postgraduate students enrolled on programmes such as Master of Business Administration or specialist masters in a business field such as marketing or strategy and also for Executive Education courses.

This marginalisation of social reproduction adversely affects those performing it and reduces their resilience to vulnerability. The pandemic has largely shattered the liberal illusions of autonomous personhood and state restraint. The reality of our universal embodied vulnerability has now become impossible to ignore, and society?s reliance on socially reproductive work has therefore been pushed into public view. However, the pandemic has also exacerbated harms and pressures for those performing paid and unpaid social reproduction, creating a crisis that demands an urgent state response. As it is argued in this paper, the UK response to date has been inadequate, illustrating an unwillingness to abandon familiar principles of liberal individualism. However, the pandemic has also created a climate of exceptionality, which has prompted even the most neoliberal of states to consider measures that in the past would have been dismissed. In this paper, it is imagined how the state can use this opportunity to become more responsive and improve the resilience of social reproduction workers, both inside and outside the home.","Gordon-Bouvier, Ellen",International Journal of Discrimination and the Law,4,1

However, these systems reacted differently to lockdown and a decline in business activity, which was associated with both their structures and the specifics of their development. Purpose of the article: The aim of the article is to assess the impact of the 2020 pandemic on tax revenues of Russian regions, as well as to analyze the factors contributing to the resilience of regional tax systems to epidemiological crises. Methods: The study is based on monthly data from the Federal Tax Service of the Russian Federation on total tax revenues in 83 Russian regions for 2013-2020. For data up to March 2020, we construct stationary time series and plotted ARiMA regressions. Based on them, we forecast tax revenues for the period from April to December 2020, if there were no pandemic. The impact of the pandemic is calculated as the deviation of actual tax revenue from the forecast for the corresponding 9 months. Findings & value added: We find that the impact of the pandemic on tax revenues varies over time and space. The crisis hit the fiscal system most negatively in the first three full months of the lockdown (April-June 2020). Some mining regions of the Urals, Western and Eastern Siberia, specializing in the extraction of oil and gas, as well as non-ferrous metals, turned out to be the most vulnerable to the pandemic. The most resistant to it are the central and southern regions of the European part of Russia. Calculation of Pearson's correlations shows that the greatest drop in tax revenues occur in regions with a larger share of the mining industry in gross value added and MET in tax revenues, with a higher GRP per capita and an increased level of general economic instability. The smallest decline in tax revenue, or even its growth, is observed in regions with a larger share of personal income tax and property tax in tax revenues, a higher share of trade and processing industries, social sphere and public administration in gross value added, a higher degree of economic diversification and a larger share of small business in total turnover. The obtained results are applicable to manage the resilience of tax systems to epidemiological crises.","Malkina, M. Y.",Equilibrium-Quarterly Journal of Economics and Economic Policy,4,1

Telecommuting has been a key response to the COVID‐19 pandemic, and it has translated into an increasingly and explicitly expressed desire to move out of cities and into nonmetropolitan areas where housing is less dense and infection rates are lower. This interest in counterurbanisation is an understandable response to self‐isolation. However, many postpandemic telecommuters are likely to be knowledge workers for whom some presence in the office during the working week may be required, and that may limit their counterurban moves to metropolitan hinterlands and regions. Commuter‐based population growth in metropolitan‐proximate and peri‐urban settlements may then lead to urban sprawl—that is, to disconnected and widespread suburbanisation. This article addresses emergent policy challenges for governments as they respond to the growing propensity for nonmetropolitan and particularly peri‐urban relocations that appears to be an outcome of the pandemic. Specific attention is paid to the distribution of employment and need to consider the variegated nature of population and demographic trajectories in nonmetropolitan Australia.

Bayesian decision theory posits that humans optimize their behavior by establishing and integrating internal models of past sensory experiences (priors) and decision outcomes (cost functions). An alternative model-free hypothesis posits that decisions are optimized through trial and error without explicit internal models for priors and cost functions. To distinguish between these possibilities, we introduce a novel paradigm that probes sensitivity of humans to transitions between prior-cost pairs that demand the same optimal policy (metamers) but distinct internal models. We demonstrate the utility of our approach in two experiments that were classically explained by model-based Bayesian theory. Our approach validates the model-based strategy in an interval timing task but not in a visuomotor rotation task. More generally, our work provides a domain-general approach for testing the circumstances under which humans implement model-based Bayesian computations.","Sohn, Hansem; Jazayeri, Mehrdad",bioRxiv,4,26

Effective diabetes education has been shown to improve long-term self-management and quality of life. This survey explores the educational needs of patients with or developing CFRD and sets out to identify the optimal mode of delivery for diabetes education. Methods: Adult pre- and post-transplant patients with CFRD and early glucose metabolism abnormalities from the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital CF Clinic were invited to partake in an online survey via email or text message in December 2020. The study protocol was approved by the Sydney Local Health District Ethics Committee (X20-0434). Results: 46 participants completed the survey with a response rate of 45% (female 54%;CFRD 78%;mean duration since CFRD diagnosis: 13 years;post-transplant 15%). Main sources of diabetes education for participants were the CF Clinic (65%);Google search (30%) and their general practitioner (13%). 72% of participants with CFRD felt they had enough information to manage their diabetes but favoured having a diabetes education resource package. The majority of participants preferred to receive CFRD information via an email package (61%), while others favoured perusing an educational website (37%) or phone app (24%), when requested (44%) or every 6 months (31%). The most common categories of diabetes-related information requested by participants with CFRD were updated diabetic technology (75%), CF diet and food diaries (58%), exercise (56%), management of hyper-(58%) or hypoglycemia (47%) and diabetes and alcohol consumption (42%). Conclusion: Patients with CFRD and early glucose metabolism abnormalities have ongoing educational needs and may require improved resources, preferably via virtual platforms, to supplement in-person care. Future research on the clinical impact of increasing virtual education will be necessary during this COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.","Kosbab-Jackson, K.; Raffan, F.; Jo, H.; Visser, S.; Yozghatlian, V.; Hayes, A.; Shaw, M.; Nolan, S.; Taylor, N.; Sivam, S.",Journal of Cystic Fibrosis,4,22

The heterogeneity and constant variability of hosts, in terms of age, immunological status, family structure, lifestyle, work activities, social and leisure habits, daily division of time, and other demographic characteristics make it extremely difficult to predict the evolution of epidemics. Such prediction is, however, critical for implementing intervention measures in due time and with appropriate intensity. General conclusions should be precluded, given that local parameters dominate the flow of local epidemics. Membrane computing models allows us to reproduce the objects (viruses, hosts) and their interactions (stochastic but also with defined probabilities) with an unprecedented level of detail. Our LOIMOS model helps reproduce the demographics and social aspects of a hypothetical town of 10,320 inhabitants in an average European country where COVID-19 is imported from the outside. The above-mentioned characteristics of hosts and their lifestyle are minutely considered. The dynamics of the epidemics are reproduced and include the effects on viral transmission of innate and acquired immunity at various ages. The model predicts the consequences of delaying the adoption of non-pharmaceutical interventions (between 15 and 45 days after the first reported cases) and the effect of those interventions on infection and mortality rates (reducing transmission by 20%, 50%, and 80%) in immunological response groups.

This paper discusses the problem of poverty especially in relation to food waste. The prevention of food waste can also contribute to global poverty reduction, and the reduction of food waste is a tool for sustainable growth and competitiveness. At present, the number of people at risk of poverty and the amount of food waste are increasing at unsustainable rates. An integrated and efficient tool for the management of food, energy, and water (FEW) resources to improve FEW security via an interdisciplinary approach could help address several of the most significant global challenges, such as climate change, and economic, environmental, and social security. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between the existence of poverty and the treatment of food for sustainable growth. The analysis focused on the EU countries and the main data source was the Eurostat database. Households generally create the largest proportion of food waste. Pareto analysis shows that in households, food and non-alcoholic beverages are among the first group of expenses, and in the EU countries they represent approximately 12% of the total expenses. Food and non-alcoholic beverages are a stable, unavoidable, and non-negligible element of total expenses. Paradoxically, enormous amounts of food are wasted. A relatively weak inversely proportional relationship between the amount of food waste per capita and the proportion of the population at risk of poverty among the total population of EU countries was identified through correlational analysis. A very weak relationship between the share of the population at risk of poverty in the total population and the amount of food waste per capita, excluding the population at risk of poverty, was also found.","Mihalčová, Bohuslava Korauš Antonín Prokopenko Olha Hvastová Jozefína Freňáková Magdaléna Gallo Peter Balogová Beáta",Energies,4,16

Data is lacking regarding the comparability of results obtained using these two types of beads, and for assays run on different instruments. Whilst non-magnetic beads can only be run on flow-based instruments (such as the Luminex® 100/200™ or Bio-Plex® 200), magnetic beads can be run on both these and the newer MAGPIX® instruments. In this study we utilized a panel of purified recombinant Plasmodium vivax proteins and samples from malaria-endemic areas to measure P. vivax-specific IgG responses using different combinations of beads and instruments. We directly compared: i) non-magnetic versus magnetic beads run on a Bio-Plex® 200, ii) magnetic beads run on the Bio-Plex® 200 versus MAGPIX® and iii) non-magnetic beads run on a Bio-Plex® 200 versus magnetic beads run on the MAGPIX®. We also performed an external validation of our optimized assay. We observed that IgG antibody responses, measured against our panel of P. vivax proteins, were strongly correlated in all three of our comparisons, however higher amounts of protein were required for coupling to magnetic beads. Our external validation indicated that results generated in different laboratories using the same coupled beads are also highly comparable, particularly if a reference standard curve is used.","Mazhari, Ramin; Brewster, Jessica; Fong, Rich; Bourke, Caitlin; Liu, Zoe SJ; Takashima, Eizo; Tsuboi, Takafumi; Tham, Wai-Hong; Harbers, Matthias; Chitnis, Chetan; Healer, Julie; Ome-Kaius, Maria; Sattabongkot, Jetsumon; Kazura, James; Robinson, Leanne J.; King, Christopher; Mueller, Ivo; Longley, Rhea J.",bioRxiv,4,24

However, the molecular regulators that establish and maintain the features of GM-CSF positive CD4 T cells are unknown. In order to identify these regulators, we isolated human GM-CSF producing CD4 T cells from human peripheral blood by using a cytokine capture assay. We compared these cells to the corresponding GM-CSF negative fraction, and furthermore, we studied naïve CD4 T cells, memory CD4 T cells and bulk CD4 T cells from the same individuals as additional control cell populations. As a result, we provide a rich resource of integrated chromatin accessibility (ATAC-seq) and transcriptome (RNA-seq) data from these primary human CD4 T cell subsets, and we show that the identified signatures are associated with human autoimmune disease, especially Multiple Sclerosis. By combining information about mRNA expression, DNA accessibility and predicted transcription factor binding, we reconstructed directed gene regulatory networks connecting transcription factors to their targets, which comprise putative key regulators of human GM-CSF positive CD4 T cells as well as memory CD4 T cells. Our results suggest potential therapeutic targets to be investigated in the future in human autoimmune disease.","Éliás, Szabolcs; Schmidt, Angelika; Gomez-Cabrero, David; Tegnér, Jesper",bioRxiv,4,1

Telerehabilitation and the promotion of physical activity at home have been two of the fields that have attracted more attention, especially currently due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, elderly people are sometimes reluctant to use technology at home, mainly due to fear of technology and lack of familiarity. In this context, this article presents a low-cost platform that relies on exergames and natural user interfaces to promote physical activity at home and improve the quality of life in elderly people. The underlying system is easy to use and accessible, offering a number of interaction mechanisms that guide users through the execution of routines and exercises. A relevant feature of the proposal is the ability to customize the exergames, making it possible for the therapist to adapt them according to the user’s needs. Motivation is also addressed within the developed platform to maintain the user’s engagement level as time passes by. An empirical experiment is conducted to measure the usability and motivational aspects of the proposal, which was evaluated by 17 users between 62 and 89 years of age. The obtained results showed that the proposal was well received, considering that most of the users were not experienced at all with exergame-based systems. © 2021 by the authors.

This study examined intentions to travel in the current conditions imposed by the health crisis. Various measures have been recommended or imposed by governments to control the spread of COVID-19. Travel has been significantly influenced by such measures. However, people have various travel needs, from shopping to work and leisure to exploration. The data were collected through an online questionnaire survey addressed to the active population in Romania. The application of this questionnaire coincided with the third wave of SARS-CoV-2 infections in Romania.

The impact of these measures extended both to the elements of regional aggregate demand and aggregate supply. From the point of view of the theory of short-run economic fluctuations, aggregate supply and demand shocks, such as those that occurred in the initial period of the pandemic, lead to a reduction in aggregate output followed by an increase in actual and natural rate of unemployment. Expectations have an additional negative impact since the growth of uncertainty gives rise to an increase in savings and an additional reduction in consumer activity. In the case of Khabarovsk Territory it is shown that the most affected industries of the economy were retail trade and services. Both industries experienced a negative shock in April, but while the former began recovery as early as May, the latter returned to the growth trajectory only in June. Residents changed their income usage patterns due to the restrictions on the consumer market, as well as to increased uncertainty about their future income. The share of net savings and cash balances increased with a corresponding decrease in the share of spending on goods and services. A negative supply shock contributed to a sharp rise in unemployment up to 24.5 thousand unemployed in the third quarter of 2020. Starting from the fourth quarter unemployment began to decline rapidly, but it had not reached pre-pandemic level of less than 7 thousand unemployed by the second quarter of 2021. It is shown that the permanent population outmigration, which increased in 2020, is a specific feature of the regional labor market. It has slowed down the return of the regional aggregate supply to its pre-pandemic positions after the restrictions were cancelled. © Кулецкая Л.Е., 2021","Isaev, A. G.",Spatial Economics,4,11

The effects on dimensions of pore and strut, surface roughness, as well as thermal, mechanical, and in-vitro degradation properties of the scaffolds were studied. The results showed that the dimensional accuracy was improved, and the surface roughness was tailored by the addition of steel powders that were dispersedly distributed on the strut surface. In addition, PLA/316L composite scaffolds exhibited a lower coefficient of thermal expansion than pure PLA, while glass transition temperature and crystalline phase transition temperature were not significantly affected by steel powder. Moreover, compressive strength and elastic modulus were enhanced when powder loading was set at 10 vol% or 15 vol%.

One of the limitations of online courses is that it is difficult to perform teacher-student interactions in online teaching environments.

This paper presents a lightweight IDE named CodeHelper integrated with an online judge that allows the instructor or the teaching assistant (TA) to help students in a form of online pair programming. Students can share their code with the instructor or the TA in a sandbox programming environment generated by CodeHelper, and the instructor or the TA can guide students by marking the mistakes in the sandbox. CodeHelper allows real-time pair programming for both sides, which can reduce the time and the cost of distance learning. Besides, the source code shared in the sandbox can also be compiled for syntax check, executed with a user-defined input, and submitted to the online judge for automated assessment, which can let students check the correctness of their programs once their troubles have been solved. It is efficient to use CodeHelper for mentoring students in online programming courses. © 2021 IEEE.","Liu, X.; Woo, G.","3rd International Conference on Computer Communication and the Internet, ICCCI 2021",4,27

However, these cosmic rays are also greatly impacted by energy losses and magnetic field transport effects in molecular gas. Explaining cosmic ray ionization rates of $10^{-16}$ s$^{-1}$ or greater in dense gas requires either a high external cosmic ray flux, or local sources of MeV-GeV cosmic ray protons. We present a new local source of low-energy cosmic rays in molecular clouds: first order Fermi-acceleration of protons in regions undergoing turbulent reconnection in molecular clouds. We show from energetic-based arguments there is sufficient energy within the magneto-hydrodynamic turbulent cascade to produce ionization rates compatible with inferred ionization rates in molecular clouds.

These technologies have led to the generation of quantities of raw data, known as Big Data (BD), that are complex to be analyzed. This study proposes a novel and event-driven IoT architecture that considers automated and scalable machine learning techniques with the focus sense-making from manufacturing process and systems performance in the Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) domain. In this manuscript, a novel generalized three-layer IoT architecture utilizing Edge Computing (EC), Fog Computing (FC), Cloud Computing (CC), and Federated Learning (FL) is presented, where data are preprocessed in the Edge layer, Machine Learning (ML) models are incrementally trained in the Fog layer and the trained models are aggregated in centralized cloud models. The results show that the methods discussed in the proposed architecture will lead to the development of higher performance and more scalable IoT frameworks that require minimal storage and computing power.","Parto, Mahmoud; Saldana, Christopher; Kurfess, Thomas",Procedia Manufacturing,4,15

The article focuses on practical experience in the introduction of hypertext in the educational process of higher education institutions in general and during pandemic periods, in particular, the world faces nowadays. In the course of the research, it was emphasized that such technologies are pretty significant in implementing distance learning. Hypermedia technologies create especially suitable conditions for the independent acquisition and quality assimilation of the necessary information, which can be easily integrated into the educational process. The provided analysis of the implementation of e-learning materials based on hypertext and multimedia tools made it possible to point out the advantages and disadvantages of the described technologies (compared to traditional usage of printed textbooks), thus identifying their didactic potential.

As a result, the prevalence of food insecurity increased exponentially, with Blacks and Latinos experiencing disproportionately higher rates of food insecurity. We examined associations between change in employment status due to the pandemic and food insecurity among a large sample of Black and Latino adults in a Midwestern state. Furthermore, we evaluated the role of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) participation to determine if it modified associations between change in employment status and food security status. We analyzed cross-sectional survey data collected from a volunteer sample of 1,776 Black and Latino adults in 2 waves: May and June/July 2020. Participants listed their change in employment status as follows: ""lost job entirely"", ""employed, but had paid hours reduced"", ""employed, but anticipate job lost soon"", or ""no change"". Participants self-reported SNAP participation status as yes or no and completed the USDA's 6-item U.S. Food Security Module to report food security status. We used logistic regression to assess the significance of associations after controlling for demographics. Approximately 15.4% of participants lost their job entirely, 25.7% were receiving SNAP benefits, and 16.4% were experiencing very low food security (VLFS). Change in employment (any type) was significantly associated with increased odds of VLFS after adjusting for demographics. Associations varied by SNAP status. Among SNAP participants, odds of VLFS were 2.91 times higher for those who lost their job compared to ""no change"" participants. Among non-participants, odds of VLFS were 4.58 times higher for those who lost their job. We observed strong associations between complete job loss and food insecurity, which underscores the pandemic's impact on nutritionally vulnerable populations. The strength of associations varied by SNAP participation status. None.

A model for T-cell apoptosis in vivo.,11.596715,7.949408,1996,"As obligate intracellular parasites, viruses rely exclusively on the translational machinery of the host cell for the synthesis of viral proteins. This relationship has imposed numerous challenges on both the infecting virus and the host cell. Importantly, viruses must compete with the endogenous transcripts of the host cell for the translation of viral mRNA. Eukaryotic viruses have thus evolved diverse mechanisms to ensure translational efficiency of viral mRNA above and beyond that of cellular mRNA. Mechanisms that facilitate the efficient and selective translation of viral mRNA may be inherent in the structure of the viral nucleic acid itself and can involve the recruitment and/or modification of specific host factors. These processes serve to redirect the translation apparatus to favor viral transcripts, and they often come at the expense of the host cell. Accordingly, eukaryotic cells have developed antiviral countermeasures to target the translational machinery and disrupt protein synthesis during the course of virus infection. Not to be outdone, many viruses have answered these countermeasures with their own mechanisms to disrupt cellular antiviral pathways, thereby ensuring the uncompromised translation of virion proteins. Here we review the varied and complex translational programs employed by eukaryotic viruses. We discuss how these translational strategies have been incorporated into the virus life cycle and examine how such programming contributes to the pathogenesis of the host cell.","Gale, M; Tan, S L; Katze, M G",Microbiology and molecular biology reviews : MMBR,4,12

Affected birds showed loss of condition, respiratory signs, and flock mortality rates of 50 and 98%, respectively. The proventricular lesions were associated closely with fungal organisms that were microscopically indistinguishable from the ascomycetous yeast Macrorhabdus ornithogaster (former provisional name ""megabacterium""). At necropsy, the proventriculi were swollen and hyperemic, and viscous mucus adhered to the mucosa. Proventricular hemorrhages were commonly detected, and one bird had proventricular rupture and peritonitis. Microscopically, mild to severe subacute to chronic lymphoplasmacytic proventriculitis, microabscesses, necrosis, epithelial metaplasia, disrupted koilin, ulcers, and hemorrhages were observed. Transmission electron microscopy of the proventricular microorganisms revealed a membrane-bound nucleus, vacuoles, ribosomes, microtubules in parallel arrays, and a two-layered cell wall but no mitochondria. Scanning electron microscopy of the proventricular epithelium demonstrated masses of organisms with occasional constrictions in parallel arrangement. Many of the birds also suffered from concurrent respiratory bacterial infections and/or gastrointestinal candidiasis. The clinical course and gross and microscopic proventricular lesions were similar to those described in psittacine and passerine pet birds colonized by M. ornithogaster-like microorganisms but differed from published case reports and experimental infections of chickens in which the clinical signs and lesions have been considerably milder. The findings presented in this paper suggest that mycotic proventriculitis, presumably associated with M. ornithogaster, may be a serious but possibly opportunistic, although unusual, disease problem in gray partridges on game farms.","Jansson, Désirée S; Bröjer, Caroline; Mattsson, Roland; Feinstein, Ricardo; Mörner, Torsten; Hård af Segerstad, Carl",Journal of zoo and wildlife medicine : official publication of the American Association of Zoo Veterinarians,4,1

This article presents a review and analysis of the existing literature, aiming to achieve an objective understanding of the significance of the ACE2 expression in the testis. Hitherto, clinical and laboratory data available on COVID-19 are not sufficient to provide any direct evidence that the testis is a target organ of the virus.

To date, however, there is limited knowledge concerning suitable methods that could catalyze this change on a global scale. Meditation and Yoga are practical and easy to implement psychomodulatory strategies that can naturally trigger vegetarianism and related eating behaviors, lowering our reliance on animal meat. Decreasing dependence on animal meat reduces the need for animal markets and may substantially minimize the likelihood of spillover (passage of viruses from animal reservoirs into human populations). Global implementation of these strategies, in our opinion, can add to spiritual wisdom, compassion, and cooperative human behavior, thus reducing the encroachment of wild-life reserves and animal exploitation.

The recombinant S protein-based ELISA appeared to be 100% sensitive for TGEV and PRCoV detection and highly specific for TGEV and PRCoV detection (100% and 92.06%, respectively), when qualitative results (positive or negative) were compared with those of the reference technique. In variability experiments, the ELISA gave consistent results when the same serum was evaluated on different wells and different plates. These results indicated that truncated recombinant S protein is a suitable alternative to the complete virus as antigen in ELISA assays. The use of recombinant S protein as antigen offers great advantages because it is an easy-to-produce, easy-to-standardize, noninfectious antigen that does not require further purification or concentration. Those advantages represent an important improvement for antigen preparation, in comparison with other assays in which an inactivated virus from mammalian cell cultures is used.","López, Lissett; Venteo, Angel; García, Marga; Camuñas, Ana; Ranz, Ana; García, Julia; Sarraseca, Javier; Anaya, Carmen; Rueda, Paloma","Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",4,16

Thus, this study aimed to investigate the biochemical changes in dogs experimentally infected with R. vitalii, during the acute phase of the infection. For this study, 12 female dogs (aged 6-12 months and weighing between 4 and 7 kg) were used, divided in two groups. Group A was composed of healthy dogs (n = 5); and group B consisted of infected animals (n = 7). Blood samples were collected on days 0, 10, 20 and 30 after infection, using tubes without anticoagulant to obtain serum and analyze the biochemical parameters. An increase in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) on day 20 (P < 0.05) was observed. Also, increased creatine kinase (CK) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels were observed throughout the experimental period (P < 0.05). No changes in the serum gamma-glutamyltransferase, urea and creatinine levels were observed. Thus, is possible to conclude that experimental infection with R. vitalii in dogs causes changes to the biochemical profile, with increased ALT, AST and CK enzyme levels.","Costa, Márcio Machado; França, Raqueli Teresinha; Da Silva, Aleksandro Schafer; Paim, Carlos Breno; Paim, Francine; do Amaral, Carlos Henrique; Dornelles, Guilherme Lopes; da Cunha, João Paulo Monteiro Carvalho Mori; Soares, João Fabio; Labruna, Marcelo Bahia; Mazzanti, Cinthia Melazzo Andrade; Monteiro, Silvia Gonzalez; Lopes, Sonia Terezinha Dos Anjos",Revista brasileira de parasitologia veterinaria = Brazilian journal of veterinary parasitology : Orgao Oficial do Colegio Brasileiro de Parasitologia Veterinaria,4,1

When limited to the upper respiratory region, these infections often are designated as ""a common cold."" Viruses commonly associated with these upper respiratory infections (URI) include rhinoviruses (RVs), respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, corona virus, and adenoviruses. Clinical observations have suggested that patients with allergic rhinitis and asthma experience more pronounced symptoms during a viral URI than patients who do not have allergies and who are infected with the same virus under similar circumstances. Using an experimental virus infection model in human volunteers with and without allergic rhinitis, several groups of clinical investigators have studied the effects of experimental RV infections. These observations indicate that the experimental virus infection may induce host responses that provoke enhanced immunoglobulin E (IgE) synthesis. Whether this translates into enhanced symptoms has been suggested in one study but not in another. This article will review these studies, which suggest that it is the host response to the virus and not the virus itself that plays the major role in symptom pathogenesis.","Fireman, Philip",Allergy and asthma proceedings,4,9

Apoptosis induced by SARS coronavirus N protein under starvation of serum of COS-1 cells was monitored by Annexin V and electron microscopy assays. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim) were determined by flow cytometric assay. Cytochrome C, cleaved caspase (cysteine aspartic acid protease)-3, 9, and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) were detected by Western blot. After removal of serum in COS-1 cells, we observed the loss of DeltaPsim, the increase of ROS and cytochrome C release into cytosol and subsequent activation of caspase-3 and PARP cleavage. The pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk can block the activation of caspase 3, 9 and PARP cleavage. In conclusion, SARS coronavirus N protein can induce apoptosis of COS-1 cells by activating mitochondrial pathway.

METHODS Using a mixed-methods approach, educators in magnetic resonance, medical dosimetry, radiation therapy, and radiography programs were surveyed to capture their experiences and mitigation strategies related to COVID-19 response planning. Quantitative data were summarized using descriptive statistics and percentages. Thematic analyses were performed on the qualitative responses. RESULTS A total of 274 educators responded. Educators reported being somewhat comfortable with modifying clinical experiences (79, 28.8%), moderately comfortable with adjusting assessment procedures (112, 40.9%), and extremely comfortable with changing delivery of didactic content (115, 42%). Incidentally, 220 (80.3%) educators thought adjusting to a new course delivery approach (eg, face-to-face to online format) was the greatest challenge for faculty during the pandemic. Notably, half of the educators in this study questioned the quality of online (remote) learning. Specific to program policies, educators indicated that access restrictions to campus buildings (263, 96%) and removal of students from clinical sites (254, 92.7%) were implemented during the pandemic. DISCUSSION Educators self-reported a moderate to strong comfort level with curricular modification. The area of modification that yielded the most uncertainty arose from alterations of clinical experiences. Thematic analyses revealed concerns related to personal protective equipment procurement and clinical sites prohibiting students from completing rotations. However, educators created innovative alternatives to enhance clinical education by providing simulations, case study analyses, and virtual tours of facilities during the pandemic. Securing educational technology resources, such as lockdown browser software, and working with institutional instructional designers might provide some resolution to educators' concerns regarding the quality of online (remote) learning. CONCLUSION Archiving radiologic science programs' COVID-19 response efforts is important. The compilation of mitigation strategies will inform and guide programs on contingency planning for future pandemic and emergent conditions.","Webster, Tammy L; Clark, Kevin R",Radiologic technology,4,15

Beyond the threshold challenge of the many persons without any, or a stable form of, coverage lie challenges related to the structure and characteristics of health insurance itself, particularly the commercial industry and its newly emerging market of consumer-driven health plans. States vary significantly in how they approach the regulation of insurance and in their willingness to support various types of insurance markets. This variation is attributable to the size and robustness of the insurance market, the political environment, and regulatory tradition and custom.

Following the COVID-19 outbreak, frontal and bedside teaching was interrupted. Therefore, we decided to provide distant teaching until having the opportunity to resume clinical bedside teaching. A team of tutors composed a course of weekly units, each week assigned to a different subject in internal medicine. A total of 120 students were divided into 15 groups of 8 students, each group guided by a personal tutor. The format of each unit included online pretest, clinical virtual cases and two separate 2 hour ZOOM sessions with the tutor. The pretest was based on 1-3 chapters from Harrison's Internal Medicine textbook, 20th edition, and consisted of both clinical reasoning and knowledge questions. During ZOOM sessions with the tutor, the students practiced clinical problem solving. In addition, all the students were granted free access to the commercial ""Aquifer"" case-based virtual course for more practice. The students' feedback at the end of the learning period revealed that, although frustrated in being away from the clinics, the overall level of satisfaction from the course was good (rated 5 or 4/5 by 65% of responders) and the time was used efficiently. In conclusion, the students received a positive proactive learning experience of both theoretical aspects and clinical reasoning skills in internal medicine. There is no doubt that bedside teaching in medicine is invaluable and can't be replaced by any other means, however, given the circumstances, our format provided a reasonable temporary alternative.","Dolnikov, Katya; Nave, Rachel; Krayem, Baher; Assam, Zaher; Karban, Amir; Flugelman, Moshe Y; Eisenberg, Elon; Raz-Pasteur, Ayelet",Harefuah,4,28

The detection rates were comparable to those obtained with a commercial SARS-CoV IFA kit (EUROIMMUN, Gross Groenau, Germany) and a conventional IFA performed at the Singapore General Hospital. Our data showed that the newly developed IFA could detect SARS-CoV in 22 of the 23 SARS-CoV-positive serum samples and gave no false-positive results when the sera from patients with autoimmune diseases and healthy individuals were tested. The detection rate was identical to those of the two whole-virus-based IFAs. Thus, the novel N-S fusion antigen-based IFA could be an attractive alternative to present whole-virus-based IFAs for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV infection.","He, Qigai; Manopo, Ivanus; Lu, Liqun; Leung, Bernard P; Chng, Hiok Hee; Ling, Ai Ee; Chee, Li Lian; Chan, Shzu-Wei; Ooi, Eng Eong; Sin, Yeo Lee; Ang, Brenda; Kwang, Jimmy",Clinical and diagnostic laboratory immunology,4,1

The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) associated coronavirus outbreak in late 2002, early 2003 called attention to the potential damage that coronaviruses could cause in the human population. The ensuing research has enlightened many to the molecular biology of coronaviruses. A programmed -1 ribosomal frameshift is required by coronaviruses for the production of the RNA dependent RNA polymerase which in turn is essential for viral replication. The frameshifting signal encoded in the viral genome has additional features that are not essential for frameshifting. Elucidation of the differences between coronavirus frameshift signals and signals from other viruses may help our understanding of these features. Here we summarize current knowledge and add additional insight regarding the function of the programmed -1 ribosomal frameshift signal in the coronavirus lifecycle.","Plant, Ewan P; Dinman, Jonathan D",Frontiers in bioscience : a journal and virtual library,4,22

We showed that during localized respiratory infections the ratio of activated effector CD8(+) T cells to resting memory/naive CD8(+) T cells in peripheral blood increased significantly. Furthermore, the number of effector/memory T cells specific for respiratory viruses declined in blood and increased in the airways, suggesting that these T cells redistributed from blood to airways. T cells specific for the infecting virus were present in the airways for longer periods at increased levels than nonspecifically recruited bystander T cells. After clearance of the infection, the ratio of resting memory and naive CD8(+) T cells normalized in peripheral blood and also memory T cell numbers specific for unrelated viruses that declined during the infection due to bystander recruitment were restored. Taken together, these results showed a significant systemic T cell response during relatively mild secondary infections and extensive dynamics of virus-specific and nonspecific Ag-experienced T cells.","Heidema, Jojanneke; Rossen, John W A; Lukens, Michaël V; Ketel, Marianne S; Scheltens, Eva; Kranendonk, Mariette E G; van Maren, Wendy W C; van Loon, Anton M; Otten, Henny G; Kimpen, Jan L L; van Bleek, Grada M",Journal of immunology,4,26

Since reducing the amount of virus in saliva is considered to prevent broader infection, the Center for Disease Control (CDC) and American Dental Hygienists' Association (ADHA) have recommended use of CPC- or CHX-containing oral care products before the dental procedure. However, there is no certified evidence. So, we examined inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 by oral care products in several countries in vitro. Methods: 0.05% Cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) mouthwash, 0.05% CPC toothpaste and 0.30% CPC spray in Japan; 0.06% chlorhexidine gluconate (CHX) + 0.05% CPC mouthwash and 0.12% CHX + 0.05% CPC mouthwash in Europe; 0.075% CPC mouthwash, 0.12% CHX mouthwash, and 0.20% delmopinol hydrochloride mouthwash in the USA; and 0.04% CPC mouthwash in China were assessed for their virucidal activity with ASTM E1052. Results: The virus was inactivated in vitro by the contact time in directions for use of all oral care products containing CPC or delmopinol hydrochloride as anticeptics.

The modules were implemented as part of a multicomponent quality improvement initiative across a six-hospital health system. This article describes the development and evaluation of this educational intervention. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clinician education modules targeting surgical prescribers, nurses, and pharmacists were developed and implemented by an interdisciplinary team. Clinicians were invited to participate in an evaluation survey after completing the modules. Survey items assessed clinicians' rating of the module and intention to change clinical practice because of the module. Quantitative and qualitative survey responses were analyzed by the study team. RESULTS: A total of 2119 clinicians completed the module and 1831 of these clinicians (86.4%) completed the survey. Of clinicians completing the survey, 65.6% reported that they intend to change clinical practice after completing the module. Intended changes were related to increased knowledge and awareness, provider empowerment, opioid prescribing practices, nonopioid prescribing practices, and patient education. Many clinicians who indicated they do not intend to change practice reported that their clinical practices were already in line with module recommendations. Some clinicians did not perceive the module to be relevant to their role. CONCLUSIONS: Module completion was associated with the intention to improve clinical practice in areas related to provider empowerment, opioid prescribing, nonopioid prescribing, and patient education. Evaluation data will inform future module improvements. There is an opportunity to ensure that all clinicians, including those who are not prescribers, recognize their role in opioid stewardship.","Shallcross, Meagan L; Stulberg, Jonah J; Schäfer, Willemijn L A; Buckley, Barbara A; Huang, Reiping; Bilimoria, Karl Y; Johnson, Julie K",J Surg Res,4,22

Although these patients typically report relatively high pain intensity, the clinical course of their pain and disability remains unclear. Our objective was to review the literature and describe the clinical course of non-specific low back pain after an ED visit. METHODS: Electronic searches were conducted using MEDLINE, CINAHL and EMBASE from inception to March 2019. We screened for cohort studies or randomised trials investigating pain or disability in patients with non-specific low back pain presenting to EDs. We excluded studies that enrolled participants with minimal pain or disability scores at baseline. Two reviewers independently screened the full texts, extracted the data and assessed risk of bias and quality of evidence. Estimates of pain and disability were converted to a common 0-100 scale. We estimated pooled means and 95% CIs of pain and disability as a function of time since ED presentation. RESULTS: Eight studies (nine publications) with a total of 1994 patients provided moderate overall quality evidence of the expected clinical course of low back pain after an ED visit. Seven of the eight studies were assessed to have a low risk of bias. At the time of the ED presentation, the pooled estimate of the mean pain score on a 0-100 scale was 71.0 (95% CI 64.2-77.9). This reduced to 46.1 (95% CI 37.2-55.0) after 1 day, 41.8 (95% CI 34.7 to 49.0) after 1 week and 13.5 (95% CI 5.8-21.3) after 26 weeks. The course of disability followed a similar pattern. CONCLUSIONS: Patients presenting to EDs with non-specific low back pain experience rapid reductions in pain intensity, but on average symptoms persisted 6 months later. This review can be used to educate patients so they can have realistic expectations of their recovery.","Coombs, Danielle M; Machado, Gustavo C; Richards, Bethan; Oliveira, Crystian B; Herbert, Robert D; Maher, Chris G",Emerg. med. j,4,26

To describe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patient presentations requiring otolaryngology consultation and provide recommendations for protective measures based on the experience of ear, nose, and throat (ENT) departments in 4 Chinese hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic. Study Design. Retrospective case series. Setting. Multicenter. Subjects and Methods. Twenty hospitalized COVID-19 patients requiring ENT consultation from 3 designated COVID-19 hospitals in Wuhan, Shanghai, and Shenzhen were identified. Data on demographics, comorbidities, COVID-19 symptoms and severity, consult reason, treatment, and personal protective equipment (PPE) use were collected and analyzed. Infection control strategies implemented for ENT outpatients and emergency room visits at the Eye and ENT Hospital of Fudan University were reported. Results. Median age was 63 years, 55% were male, and 95% were in severe or critical condition. Six tracheotomies were performed. Posttracheotomy outcomes were mixed (2 deaths, 2 patients comatose, all living patients still hospitalized). Other consults included epistaxis, pharyngitis, nasal congestion, hyposmia, rhinitis, otitis externa, dizziness, and tinnitus. At all hospitals, powered air-supply filter respirators (PAPRs) were used for tracheotomy or bleeding control. PAPR or N95-equivalent masks plus full protective clothing were used for other complaints. No inpatient ENT providers were infected. After implementation of infection control strategies for outpatient clinics, emergency visits, and surgeries, no providers were infected at the Eye and ENT Hospital of Fudan University. Conclusions and Relevance. COVID-19 patients require ENT consultation for many reasons, including tracheotomy. Otolaryngologists play an indispensable role in the treatment of COVID-19 patients but, due to their work, are at high risk of exposure.

This study explores whether any surrogate biomarkers are specifically associated with GA. Plasma from subjects with GA, intermediate dry AMD and non-AMD control were evaluated in 2 cohorts. Cohort 1 was assayed in a 320-analyte Luminex library. Statistical analysis was performed using non-parametric and parametric methods (Kruskal-Wallis, principal component analysis, partial least squares and multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) and univariate ANCOVAs). Bioinformatic analysis was conducted and identified connections to the amyloid pathway. Statistically significant biomarkers identified in Cohort 1 were then re-evaluated in Cohort 2 using individual ELISA and multiplexing. Of 320 analytes in Cohort 1, 273 were rendered measurable, of which 56 were identified as changing. Among these markers, 40 were identified in univariate ANCOVAs. Serum amyloid precursor protein (sAPP) was analyzed by a separate ELISA and included in further analyses. The 40 biomarkers, sAPP and amyloid-ß (Aß) (1-42) (included for comparison) were evaluated in Cohort 2. This resulted in 11 statistically significant biomarkers, including sAPP and Aß(1-40), but not Aß(1-42). Other biomarkers identified included serum proteases- tissue plasminogen activator, tumor-associated trypsinogen inhibitor, matrix metalloproteinases 7 and 9, and non-proteases- insulin-like growth factor binding protein 6, AXL receptor tyrosine kinase, omentin, pentraxin-3 and osteopontin. Findings suggest that there is a preferential processing of APP to Aß(1-40) over Aß(1-42), and a potential role for the carboxylase activity of the Î³-secretase protein, which preferentially splices sAPPß to Aß(1-40). Other markers are associated with the breakdown and remodeling of the extracellular matrix, and loss of homeostasis, possibly within the photoreceptor-retinal pigment epithelium-choriocapillaris complex.

Grey literature was also examined. There were no restrictions with regards to language, time of publication or participant demographics including gender, age and ethnicity.Study selection Both clinical and in vitro studies were included in the data search. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were clearly identified. Study selection was carried out in two phases by two independent reviewers. The studies included fitted the following criteria: studies that hypothesised the use of mouthwashes as a form of intervention to decrease the viral load in saliva contaminated with coronavirus. Two other studies were included in this review and both were conducted in Germany, performed in vitro, which tested povidone-iodine (PVP-I) mouthwash at two different concentrations: 1% and 7%. Both studies used the same culture mediums for clean and dirty conditions, and the evaluated outcome was the viral titre of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. The studies were published in 2015 and 2018. Neither study evaluated the action of this mouthwash on SARS-CoV-2 infection.Data extraction and synthesis The extraction of data followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline process. Studies chosen for analysis included assessment of the following data parameters for risk of bias: cell origin and cell type used, duration of exposure, frequency of exposure, magnetic flux density of exposure, environmental background magnetic field, use of control treatment, temperature control, blinding of exposure, randomisation of exposure, measurement of cell vitality, identical methods for control and exposure groups, randomisation of data measurements and potential industry sponsorship.Results One study assessed the effect of the mouthwash on MERS-CoV and the other on both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. In both studies, following 15 seconds of exposure to the mouthwash, a reduction in viral load of >99.99% was seen. There was a measurable reduction in viral titre in the samples, with one study reporting a reduction to 4.30 log10 TCID50/ml from 6.00-6.50 log10 TCID50/ml. Other mouthwashes such as hydrogen peroxide and chlorhexidine were not assessed in these studies.Conclusions The study concludes that PVP-I mouthwash at concentrations of 1% and 7% for 15 seconds may be effective at reducing the viral load of COVID-19 in human saliva.

It also has challenged conventional wisdom and empirical understandings in the comparative politics and policy of health. Three major questions present themselves: First, some of the countries considered to be most prepared-having the greatest capacity for outbreak response-have failed to respond effectively to the pandemic. How should our understanding of capacity shift in light of COVID-19, and how can we incorporate political capacity into thinking about pandemic preparedness? Second, several of the mechanisms through which democracy has been shown to be beneficial for health have not traveled well to explain the performance of governments in this pandemic. Is there an authoritarian advantage in disease response? Third, after decades in which coercive public health measures have increasingly been considered counterproductive, COVID-19 has inspired widespread embrace of rigid lockdowns, isolation, and quarantine enforced by police. Will these measures prove effective in the long run and reshape public health thinking? This article explores some of these questions with emerging examples, even amid the pandemic, when it is too soon to draw conclusions.","Kavanagh, Matthew M; Singh, Renu",J Health Polit Policy Law,4,1

The surveys aimed to collect coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) related information in Ecuador and Sri Lanka using mobile phones. In Ecuador, a Knowledge, Attitudes and Practices (KAP) survey was conducted. In Sri Lanka, an evaluation of a novel medicine delivery system was conducted. Using the established mobile network operator channels and technical assistance provided through The Bloomberg Philanthropies Data for Health Initiative (D4H), Ministries of Health fielded a population-based COVID-19-specific MPS using Surveda, the open source data collection tool developed as part of the initiative. A total of 1,185 adults in Ecuador completed the MPS in 14 days. A total of 5,001 adults over the age of 35 in Sri Lanka completed the MPS in 44 days. Both samples were adjusted to the 2019 United Nations Population Estimates to produce population-based estimates by age and sex. The Ecuador COVID-19 MPS found that there was compliance with the mitigation strategies implemented in that country. Overall, 96.5% of Ecuadorians reported wearing a face mask or face covering when leaving home. Overall, 3.8% of Sri Lankans used the service to receive medicines from a government clinic. Among those who used the medicine delivery service in Sri Lanka, 95.8% of those who used a private pharmacy received their medications within one week, and 69.9% of those using a government clinic reported the same.

The October 21, 2020 the UN Secretary-General report on progress towards implementation of the UNHLM political declaration on TB stresses that although high-level commitments and targets had galvanized global and national progress towards ending TB, urgent and more ambitious investments and actions were required, especially in lieu of the COVID-19 pandemic where associated public health measures and travel restrictions, have disrupted health services universally. The report sets out 10 priority recommendations to get the world on track to reach agreed targets by 2022. Political commitment is more critical than ever. COVID-19 diagnostic and vaccination health services need to be aligned to TB services with active early case finding in communities, engaging the private sector care providers and mitigation of fear and stigma. Healthcare staff and community workers and leaders need to be provided with COVID-19 vaccination and personal protective equipment. The UNHLM declaration committed to mobilize 15 billion USD per annum for TB, of which 13 billion USD is for TB care and 2 billion USD per annum for TB R&D. The Global Fund needs to increase funding for TB. Learning from the unprecedented speed of COVID-19 vaccine development, fastracking development and evaluation of TB vaccines is essential.

Although most COVID-19 patients present with respiratory symptoms, some present with gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms like diarrhoea, loss of appetite, nausea/vomiting and abdominal pain as the major complaints. These features may be attributable to the following facts: (a) COVID-19 is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and its receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was found to be highly expressed in GI epithelial cells, providing a prerequisite for SARS-CoV-2 infection; (b) SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA has been found in stool specimens of infected patients, and 20% of patients showed prolonged presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in faecal samples after the virus converting to negative in the respiratory system. These findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may be able to actively infect and replicate in the GI tract. Moreover, GI infection could be the first manifestation antedating respiratory symptoms; patients suffering only digestive symptoms but no respiratory symptoms as clinical manifestation have also been reported. Thus, the implications of digestive symptoms in patients with COVID-19 is of great importance. In this review, we summarise recent findings on the epidemiology of GI tract involvement, potential mechanisms of faecal–oral transmission, GI and liver manifestation, pathological/histological features in patients with COVID-19 and the diagnosis, management of patients with pre-existing GI and liver diseases as well as precautions for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection during GI endoscopy procedures.","Su, Song; Shen, Jun; Zhu, Liangru; Qiu, Yun; He, Jin-Shen; Tan, Jin-Yu; Iacucci, Marietta; Ng, Siew C; Ghosh, Subrata; Mao, Ren; Liang, Jie",Ther.

Policy responses have disrupted usual patterns of movement in society, locally and globally, with resultant impacts on national economies and human well-being. These interventions have primarily centred on enforcing lockdowns and introducing social distancing recommendations, leading to questions of trust and competency around the role of institutions and the administrative apparatus of state. This study demonstrates the unequal societal impacts in population movement during a national 'lockdown'. METHODS: We use nationwide mobile phone movement data to quantify the effect of an enforced lockdown on population mobility by neighbourhood deprivation using an ecological study design. We then derive a mobility index using anonymised aggregated population counts for each neighbourhood (2253 Census Statistical Areas; mean population n=2086) of national hourly mobile phone location data (7.45 million records, 1 March 2020-20 July 2020) for New Zealand (NZ). RESULTS: Curtailing movement has highlighted and exacerbated underlying social and spatial inequalities. Our analysis reveals the unequal movements during 'lockdown' by neighbourhood socioeconomic status in NZ. CONCLUSION: In understanding inequalities in neighbourhood movements, we are contributing critical new evidence to the policy debate about the impact(s) and efficacy of national, regional or local lockdowns which have sparked such controversy.","Campbell, Malcolm; Marek, Lukas; Wiki, Jesse; Hobbs, Matthew; Sabel, Clive E; McCarthy, John; Kingham, Simon",J. epidemiol. community health (1979),4,16

Here we report on the performance of a depth-sensing camera system for the continuous non-contact monitoring of Respiratory Rate (RR) and Tidal Volume (TV), where these parameters were compared to a ventilator reference. Depth sensing data streams were acquired and processed over a series of runs on a single volunteer comprising a range of respiratory rates and tidal volumes to generate depth-based respiratory rate (RRdepth) and tidal volume (TVdepth) estimates. The bias and root mean squared difference (RMSD) accuracy between RRdepth and the ventilator reference, RRvent, across the whole data set was found to be -0.02 breaths/min and 0.51 breaths/min respectively. The least squares fit regression equation was determined to be: RRdepth = 0.96 × RRvent + 0.57 breaths/min and the resulting Pearson correlation coefficient, R, was 0.98 (p < 0.001). Correspondingly, the bias and root mean squared difference (RMSD) accuracy between TVdepth and the reference TVvent across the whole data set was found to be - 0.21 L and 0.23 L respectively. The least squares fit regression equation was determined to be: TVdepth = 0.79 × TVvent-0.01 L and the resulting Pearson correlation coefficient, R, was 0.92 (p < 0.001). In conclusion, a high degree of agreement was found between the depth-based respiration rate and its ventilator reference, indicating that RRdepth is a promising modality for the accurate non-contact respiratory rate monitoring in the clinical setting. In addition, a high degree of correlation between depth-based tidal volume and its ventilator reference was found, indicating that TVdepth may provide a useful monitor of tidal volume trending in practice. Future work should aim to further test these parameters in the clinical setting.","Addison, Paul S; Smit, Philip; Jacquel, Dominique; Addison, Anthony P; Miller, Cyndy; Kimm, Gardner",J. clin. monit. comput,4,14

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This observational, descriptive, medical records review study was performed on patients with MIS-C admitted to the PICU between September 1 and November 1, 2020. Through medical records review, we confirmed that patients were positive for current or recent SARS-CoV-2 infection or for COVID-19 exposure history within the 4 weeks before the onset of symptoms. RESULTS: A total of 33 patients with severe MIS-C were included (21 male) with a median age of 9 years. The most common signs and symptoms during disease course were fever (100%) and abdominal pain (75.5%). Clinical features of 63.6% patients were consistent with Kawasaki disease/Kawasaki disease shock syndrome, and 36.4% were consistent with secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis/macrophage activation syndrome. Myocardial dysfunction and/or coronary artery abnormalities were detected in 18 patients during the PICU stay. Intravenous immunoglobulin and corticosteroids were given to 33 patients. Anakinra was administered to 23 patients (69.6%). There was a significant increase in lymphocyte and platelet counts and a significant decrease in ferritin, B-type natriuretic peptide, and troponin levels at the end of the first week of treatment in patients who were given biological therapy. Two patients were switched to tocilizumab because of an insufficient response to anakinra. The mortality rate of MIS-C patients admitted in PICU was 6.0%. CONCLUSIONS: Management of systemic inflammation and shock is important to decrease mortality and the development of persistent cardiac dysfunction in MIS-C. The aggressive treatment approach, including biological agents, may be required in patients with severe symptoms and cardiac dysfunction.","Çelikel, Elif; Tekin, Zahide Ekici; Aydin, Fatma; Emeksiz, Serhat; Uyar, Emel; Özcan, Serhan; Perk, Oktay; Sezer, Müge; Tekgöz, Nilüfer; Coskun, Serkan; Güngörer, Vildan; Gül, Ayse Esin Kibar; Bayhan, Gülsüm Iclal; Özbek, Namik; Azili, Müjdem Nur; Acar, Banu Çelikel",J. clin. rheumatol,4,16

Social distancing measures were needed to reduce transmission, and lockdown included restricted access to health care facilities. The impact of COVID-19 on transplant recipients is unknown, but considering their immunosuppression status and associated comorbidities, they should be considered a high-risk population. METHODS: A kidney transplant center in Central Italy implemented a strategy to maintain follow-up of kidney transplant recipients by phone and e-mail during lockdown. Telephone interviews were used to administer a clinical questionnaire to patients, and e-mail was used to receive the results of diagnostic tests conducted in outpatient settings. RESULTS: From March 17 to April 23, 2020, a total of 143 kidney transplant recipients were contacted. Twenty-eight patients needed in-hospital consultation for problems unrelated to COVID-19, 3 of whom needed hospitalization. Eleven patients were managed at home for mild urinary or respiratory diseases, and 1 was referred to the hematologist. We identified 2 suspected cases of COVID-19 infection, and the patients were referred to hospital care. Immunosuppressive therapy was modulated, and intravenous corticosteroids and potentially effective antiviral therapy were administered with a favorable outcome. CONCLUSIONS: In the context of a lockdown, such as that occurring in response to COVID-19, we suggest implementing remote surveillance programs in kidney transplant recipients with the help of any available technology and offering medical consulting and logistic support as needed.","Binda, Barbara; Picchi, Giovanna; Carucci, Anna Cecilia; Sinatti, Gaia; Di Norcia, Monica; Grimaldi, Alessandro; Lancione, Laura; Natili, Andrea; Chiappori, Davide; Montali, Filippo; Lupi, Diana; Martinez, Viviana; Panarese, Alessandra; D039,; anselmi, Fabrizio; Pisani, Francesco",Transplant Proc,4,1

This article provides a biopsychosocial perspective on the COVID pandemic and an editorial comment on the articles in this Special Issue of Psychosomatic Medicine. Based on analysis of the PubMed database, it is shown that the attention to psychological and social factors is 74% higher in COVID-19-related articles compared to all other health-related scientific articles published during the same time-period (between 1/1/2020 and 4/18/2021). Specifically, 18.6% of the &#8776;123,500 articles addressing COVID-19-related topics also included psychological or social factors in their content vs. 10.7% of articles that did not address COVID-19. The biopsychosocial model is relevant to understanding the interrelationships among risk factors and the multidimensional clinical and psychosocial COVID-19 outcomes. Clinical outcomes directly related to COVID-19 range from severe but rare events (mortality and intensive care treatment) to less severe common outcomes such as positive screening tests for COVID-19 with or without symptoms. In addition, psychosocial outcomes range in severity from frequently observed reduced psychological wellbeing to less common clinical mood and anxiety disorders and, in rare cases, suicidality. The COVID-19 pandemic is characterized by an unusually strong and short-term link between social factors and biological aspects of the disease, without mediating psychological factors. After a review of the articles presented in this Special Issue, this editorial concludes with suggestions for biopsychosocial models in research on COVID-19 and other large-scale health threats.","Kop, Willem J",Psychosom Med,4,20

COVID-19 has a range of symptoms that includes fever, fatigue, dry cough, aches, and labored breathing to acute respiratory distress and possibly death. Health systems and hospitals have been completely rearranged since March 2020 in order to limit the high rate of virus spreading. Hence, a great debate on deferrable visits and treatments including phototherapy for skin diseases is developing. In particular, as regards phototherapy very few data are currently available regarding the chance to continue it, even if it may be a useful resource for treating numerous dermatological patients. However, phototherapy has an immunosuppressive action possibly facilitating virus infection. In the context of COVID-19 infection risk it is important to pointed out whether sunlight, phototherapy and in particular ultraviolet radiation (UV-R) constitute or not a risk for patients. In this review we aimed to focus on the relationship between UV-R, sunlight, phototherapy, and viral infections particularly focusing on COVID-19.","Megna, Matteo; Marasca, Claudio; Fabbrocini, Gabriella; Monfrecola, Giuseppe",Ital J Dermatol Venerol,4,24

We examined the intention to receive vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 and the associated factors in a representative sample of Chinese adults in Hong Kong. METHODS: We did a dual-frame (landline and mobile) cross-sectional survey of a random sample of 1501 Hong Kong residents aged 18 years or older (53.6% females) in April 2020. We collected data on the intention to receive SARS-CoV-2 vaccine when it becomes available (yes/ no/ undecided), knowledge and perceptions of COVID-19, smoking, alcohol drinking, and sociodemographic factors. Prevalence estimates were weighted by the sex, age, and education of the general population of Hong Kong. RESULTS: Overall, 45.3% (95% CI: 42.3-48.4%) of the participants had intentions to vaccinate against SARS-CoV-2 when it becomes available, 29.2% (26.5-32.1%) were undecided, and 25.5% (22.9-28.2%) had no intention. The most common reason for vaccine hesitancy (undecided or no intention) was safety concerns (56.5%). Multivariable partial proportional odds model showed higher vaccine hesitancy in males, younger adults, those with no chronic disease, current smokers, and non-alcohol drinkers. After adjusting for sociodemographic and other factors, inadequate knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 transmission (adjusted ORs ranged from 1.27 to 2.63; P < 0.05) and lower perceived danger of COVID-19 (adjusted ORs ranged from 1.62 to 2.47; P < 0.001) were significantly associated with vaccine hesitancy. CONCLUSIONS: In a representative sample of Chinese adults in Hong Kong, only 45.3% of the participants intended to vaccinate against SARS-CoV-2 when available. Vaccine hesitancy was associated with inadequate knowledge about SARS-CoV-2 transmission and lower perceived danger of COVID-19, which needed to be addressed to improve vaccination uptake.","Luk, Tzu Tsun; Zhao, Shengzhi; Wu, Yongda; Wong, Janet Yuen-Ha; Wang, Man Ping; Lam, Tai Hing",Vaccine,4,16

US data showed a 70% enrollment reduction in April and a 38% reduction in July 2020, compared to prepandemic rates. We implemented processes during the initial phase of the pandemic to minimize participant and staff viral exposure, develop remote procedures, and ease communication barriers, while still maintaining enrollment goals. Methods: Our stroke research team developed multiple processes to help mitigate pandemic effects on our enrollment. We developed watchlists for eligible and interested patients who could not be enrolled due to national and local restrictions. As research staff was unable to approach patients in person, phone and email scripts were developed to ensure information was disseminated in a consistent fashion. Remote and alternate consent methods were implemented. We tracked the evolving national and local guideline changes, and began re-opening trials on May 23, 2020. We implemented a rotating pool of coordinators, including a site-specific sanitation plan, once it was safe to be on campus in-person. In person meetings were moved to a virtual platform. Enrollment data across for 10 active subacute stroke studies, each active over the 3 years of, 2018-2020, was analyzed for the months from March to June, with 2020 individually compared to 2018 and 2019 via the Student T-Test. Results: Total enrollment during these 4 months were 15 participants in 2018, 11 in 2019, and 15 in 2020, with no statistical difference between the years. No study patients nor staff contracted symptoms of COVID-19. Conclusion: Enrollment shows no significant changes despite COVID-19. New processes allowedthe timely reopening of clinical trials, an overall maintenance of enrollment rates, including a non-significant increase in 2020 compared to previous years. Our telehealth and virtual communicationfocused processes prioritize the safety of patients and staff while ensuring quality control andappropriate enrollment numbers.","Rock, T.; Aitken, K.; Wong, K.

Our aim was to identify factors influencing intestinal ACE2 expression in Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC) and non-inflammatory bowel disease (non-IBD) controls. METHODS: Using bulk RNA-seq or microarray transcriptomics from tissue samples (4 SB and 2 colonic cohorts; CD=495; UC=387; non-IBD=94), we analyzed the relationship of ACE2 with demographics, disease activity and prognosis. We examined the outcome of anti-TNF and anti-IL12/IL-23 treatment on SB and colonic ACE2 expression in three clinical trials. Univariate and multivariate regression models were fitted. RESULTS: ACE2 levels were consistently reduced in SB CD and elevated in colonic UC, when compared to non-IBD controls. Elevated SB ACE2 was also associated with demographic features (age and elevated BMI) associated with poor COVID-19 outcomes. Within CD, SB ACE2 was reduced in patients subsequently developing complicated disease. Within UC, colonic ACE2 was elevated in active disease and in patients subsequently requiring anti-TNF rescue therapy. SB and colonic ACE2 expression in active CD and UC were restored by anti-cytokine therapy, most notably in responders. CONCLUSIONS: Reduced SB, but elevated colonic ACE2 levels in IBD are associated with inflammation and severe disease but normalized following anti-cytokine therapy suggesting compartmentalization of ACE2-related biology in SB and colonic inflammation. The restoration of ACE2 expression with anti-cytokine therapy may be important in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection and potentially explain reports of reduced morbidity from COVID-19 in IBD patients treated with anti-cytokines.","Potdar, Alka A; Dube, Shishir; Naito, Takeo; Li, Katherine; Botwin, Gregory; Haritunians, Talin; Li, Dalin; Casero, David; Yang, Shaohong; Bilsborough, Janine; Perrigoue, Jacqueline G; Denson, Lee A; Daly, Mark; Targan, Stephan R; Fleshner, Phillip; Braun, Jonathan; Kugathasan, Subra; Stappenbeck, Thaddeus S; McGovern, Dermot P B",Gastroenterology,4,1

While some effective vaccines are nowadays approved and extensively administered, the long-term efficacy and safety of this line of intervention is constantly under debate as coronaviruses rapidly mutate and several SARS-CoV-2 variants have been already identified worldwide. Then, the WHO's main recommendations to prevent severe clinical complications by COVID-19 are still essentially based on social distancing and limitation of human interactions, therefore the identification of new target-based drugs became a priority. Several strategies have been proposed to counteract such viral infection, including the repurposing of FDA already approved for the treatment of HIV, HCV, and EBOLA, inter alia. Among the evaluated compounds, inhibitors of the main protease of the coronavirus (M&lt;sup&gt;pro&lt;/sup&gt;) are becoming more and more promising candidates. M&lt;sup&gt;pro&lt;/sup&gt; holds a pivotal role during the onset of the infection and its function is intimately related with the beginning of viral replication. The interruption of its catalytic activity could represent a relevant strategy for the development of anti-coronavirus drugs.

We further show how these lessons are relevant to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. Commonly, emergency response organisations, like the URCS or hospitals, are ill equipped to handle longer lasting emergencies. These emergencies require special measures that combine ad-hoc action, continuous awareness over longer time periods, and the collaboration of multiple actors such as the government, public health institutions and other non-governmental organisations (NGOs). Results From our study we can translate seven lessons learnt which are important for managing long-term public health emergencies such as pandemics: (1) centralised pooling and management of resources;(2) engagement of local communities in response efforts;(3) the need to continuously recruit and train staff;(4) the establishment of adjusted working patterns to prevent staff exhaustion;(5) cooperation of involved agencies with security for enforcing measures;(6) the revision of funding frameworks;and (7) the use of global positioning system (GPS) data to identify population movement patterns. Conclusion Although still speculative at this stage, we apply these lessons to the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. We argue that immediate action in the areas of resource pooling and control over critical resources, in the engagement of trusted and respected individuals in risk communication, in the continuous training and hiring of new staff, and in the appropriation of GPS tracking data is called for in managing SARS-CoV-2 by policy makers, NGOs and other involved agencies.","Geiger, D.; Harborth, L.; Mugyisha, A.",Bmj Leader,4,7

Pharmacists faced many challenges such as incorporating safety measures, changes in working schedule and workload, and meeting specific patients' needs. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to explore and compare the community pharmacists' roles, practices, implemented safety measures, and psychological toll in Croatia and Serbia during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A cross-sectional study employing an online survey was conducted in 2 countries over a period of 6 weeks during 2020. The survey consisted of 65 items that explored sociodemographic characteristics of participants and their workplaces, including safety measures, pharmaceutical care, and their psychology while working during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: In total, 574 pharmacists participated in the study, of which, 90% were female, with a mean age of 38 years (interquartile range 30.5-47). The study identified new pharmacists' roles that evolved during the COVID-19 pandemic: manufacturing hand sanitizers in community pharmacies, online patient counseling, and home delivery of medicines. Croatian and Serbian pharmacists exhibited disparities in their incorporated safety measures (higher for Croatia; P &#8804; 0.001) and satisfaction with work organization and counseling activities (higher for Serbia; P < 0.001). Serbian participants were less satisfied with the public perception of their role during the pandemic, and overall satisfaction was low, with a negative impact on mood and productivity. CONCLUSIONS: The study revealed the implications for community pharmacists during the pandemic in both countries. The extent of systematic and logistical support provided to them during the pandemic could be an explanation for the highlighted differences. It is imperative to develop a more effective strategy to counter potential health crises to ensure a better response from primary care pharmacists in the future.","Novak, Helena; Tadic, Ivana; Falamic, Slaven; Ortner Hadziabdic, Maja",J Am Pharm Assoc (2003),4,23

Comparison of three strategies to achieve venodilation (tourniquet, electrical stimulation, or a combined strategy) on increase in venous size. METHODS: A total of 54 volunteers participated in this cross-over observational study with healthy adults, measuring venous cross-sectional area and diameter at six different sites of the upper extremity. Measurements are performed with ultrasound after performing any dilation strategy, and compared with its non-dilated venous size. An increased cross-sectional area of 25 square millimetres was denoted as clinical relevant, which was detected with paired t testing, Wilcoxon signed rank testing or with ANOVA testing. RESULTS: The cephalic vein is the greatest at all sites (t=12.43, df=39, P<0.001 for the crosssectional area), unless the largest increase in venous size was obtained in the basilic veins (t=12.11, df=39, P<0.001 for the cross-sectional area). The largest increase in venous size was obtained after electrical stimulation followed by tourniquet application at all measurement sites. Percentage-wise increased the basilic vein with 44% in cross-sectional area and 21% in diameter, which were 37% and 17% for the cross-sectional area and diameter of the cephalic vein. CONCLUSIONS: In general, the largest sized veins are situated in the upper arm, of which the cephalic vein has the largest cross-sectional area and diameter. The combination of electrical stimulation followed by tourniquet application resulted in the greatest increase in venous size and is therefore considered as most effective to improve peripheral intravenous cannulation success.","van Loon, Fredericus H; Korsten, Hendrikus H; Dierick-van Daele, Angelique T; Bouwman, Arthur R",Minerva anestesiol,4,16

Lifestyle information including diet, activity, and sleep behaviors was collected at baseline and 3 weeks into the national lockdown during which home confinement was mandatory. Changes in outcomes over the two study time points were evaluated for significance using paired t tests. RESULTS: There were no changes in reported vegetable intake; fruit intake increased (P = 0.055) during the lockdown. By contrast, potato chip, red meat, and sugary drink intakes increased significantly during the lockdown (P value range, 0.005 to < 0.001). Time spent in sports activities decreased by 2.30 (SD 4.60) h/wk (P = 0.003), and sleep time increased by 0.65 (SD 1.29) h/d (P = 0.003). Screen time increased by 4.85 (SD 2.40) h/d (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Recognizing these adverse collateral effects of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic lockdown is critical in avoiding depreciation of weight control efforts among youths afflicted with excess adiposity. Depending on duration, these untoward lockdown effects may have a lasting impact on a child's or adolescent's adult adiposity level.","Pietrobelli, Angelo; Pecoraro, Luca; Ferruzzi, Alessandro; Heo, Moonseong; Faith, Myles; Zoller, Thomas; Antoniazzi, Franco; Piacentini, Giorgio; Fearnbach, S Nicole; Heymsfield, Steven B",Obesity (Silver Spring),4,16

WEPs provided food, nutrition, herbs and other plant products for people in underdeveloped areas, such as the Everest region, to maintain their daily lives. Chenthang Town is the only Sherpa ethnic township in Tibet, China. The core purpose of this research is to investigate, collect and record the WEPs and related local knowledge and functions within the Sherpa community. The ultimate goal is to answer the question of why Sherpa people choose these particular plants. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The field study was carried out in the six Sherpa communities of Chenthang Township from September 2019 to August 2020. The WEPs and related local knowledge were collected through semistructured interviews and direct observations. The field work was performed with the assistance of local guides. During the field survey, we collected plant specimens based on the principle of one plant with one vernacular name. In this study, we utilised a use report (UR) and cultural importance index (CI) to evaluate the comprehensive utilization value of WEPs in the daily diet of Sherpa people. RESULTS: We interviewed 78 people individually who provided us with 1199 use reports. In total, we collected 84 WEPs belonging to 65 genera in 41 families. These species were identified as 78 distinct ethno-species by local people, and the vernacular name of each ethno-species was recorded. Then, these use reports were classified into six use categories. All these plants were native wild plants. In these plants, Arisaema utile, Sorbus cuspidata and Elaeagnus umbellata have been introduced into home gardens by local people. Following the description of the Sherpa people, we articulated a collection calendar for WEPs. The Sherpa collect WEPs throughout nearly the entire year, January and February being the exceptions. CONCLUSION: The collection calendar of wild edible plants reflects the wisdom of the Sherpa in terms of survival. The Sherpa cleverly survive the food shortage periods by harnessing the phenology of different species. In general, WEPs can provide the Sherpa with seasonal carbohydrates, nutrition, healthcare supplements and other products and services necessary for survival, which is likely why the Sherpa choose these plants.","Ding, Xiao-Yong; Zhang, Yu; Wang, Lu; Zhuang, Hui-Fu; Chen, Wen-Yun; Wang, Yu-Hua",J Ethnobiol Ethnomed,4,16

Patients’ knowledge and behavior play a major role in their health. Physicians should provide patients with enough information regarding medication use, prevention strategies, and treatment choices in case of infec-tion. Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate the attitude and knowledge of Iranian patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) about COVID-19, as provided by physicians. Methods: A google form was designed, and the patients consented to fill out the survey. The participants’ basic characteristics were collected. Moreover, they were asked about COVID-19 transmission routes and prevention strategies, their concerns regarding MS-related checkups during the COVID-19 pandemic, COVID-19 infection tests, COVID-19 symptoms, and information they received from their physicians about what to do in case of COVID-19 infection. Results: Four hundred and ten forms were collected. The mean age of the patients and the mean duration of the disease were 34.5 ± 8 and 7.2 ± 5.7 years, respectively. Nearly 80% of the respondents believed that patients with MS were at a higher risk of COVID-19 infection, and 75% of them thought that wearing a face mask could prevent the infection transmission. Moreover, only 21% of 410 the physicians informed their patients of when to stop their medication if they were suspected to have COVID-19, and 22% of them informed their patients of where to refer in case of COVID-19 suspicion. Nearly half of all physicians prescribed immune-boosting supplements, such as selenium, zinc, and vitamin D. Conclusions: The results showed that Iranian MS patients had good knowledge regarding COVID-19 prevention strategies and transmission routes. However, they received less information from their physicians regarding medication use control, centers for admis-sion, and physician consultation in case of COVID-19 infection.","Ghajarzadeh, M.; Moghadasi, A.

In response, U.S. hospitals altered their care delivery systems, but there are few data regarding specific structural changes. Understanding these changes is important to guide interpretation of outcomes and inform pandemic preparedness. We sought to characterize emergency responses across hospitals in the United States over time and in the context of local case rates early in the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. DESIGN: We surveyed hospitals from a national acute care trials group regarding operational and structural changes made in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic from January to August 2020. We collected prepandemic characteristics and changes to hospital system, space, staffing, and equipment during the pandemic. We compared the timing of these changes with county-level coronavirus disease 2019 case rates. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: U.S. hospitals participating in the Prevention and Early Treatment of Acute Lung Injury Network Coronavirus Disease 2019 Observational study. Site investigators at each hospital collected local data. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Forty-five sites participated (94% response rate). System-level changes (incident command activation and elective procedure cancellation) occurred at nearly all sites, preceding rises in local case rates. The peak inpatient census during the pandemic was greater than the prior hospital bed capacity in 57% of sites with notable regional variation. Nearly half (49%) expanded ward capacity, and 63% expanded ICU capacity, with nearly all bed expansion achieved through repurposing of clinical spaces. Two-thirds of sites adapted staffing to care for patients with coronavirus disease 2019, with 48% implementing tiered staffing models, 49% adding temporary physicians, nurses, or respiratory therapists, and 30% changing the ratios of physicians or nurses to patients. CONCLUSIONS: The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic prompted widespread system-level changes, but front-line clinical care varied widely according to specific hospital needs and infrastructure. Linking operational changes to care delivery processes is a necessary step to understand the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic on patient outcomes.","Mathews, Kusum S; Seitz, Kevin P; Vranas, Kelly C; Duggal, Abhijit; Valley, Thomas S; Zhao, Bo; Gundel, Stephanie; Harhay, Michael O; Chang, Steven Y; Hough, Catherine L",Crit. care med,4,24

Seedlings were treated with either a 2-d or 4-d supply of potassium cyanide (KCN) in the nutrient solution containing nitrate (NO3-) or ammonium (NH4+). Although a KCN-induced increase was recorded in the activity of ß-cyanoalanine synthase (ß-CAS) in rice tissues of both NH4+-fed and NO3--fed seedlings, the former showed a significantly greater assimilation rate for CN- than the latter. The addition of KCN decreased NO3- uptake and assimilation, whereas a negligible impact was observed in NH4+ treatments. Enzymatic assays showed a marked activities enhancement of glutamine synthetase (GS), glutamate synthase (GOGAT), and glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) in NH4+-fed seedlings after KCN exposure. Similarly, the rises occurring in nitrate reductase (NR) and GDH activity in NO3--fed seedlings were also detected after 2-d exposure to KCN, whereas a significant reduction of GS and GOGAT activities was determined. The results suggest that although exogenous KCN at moderate or high concentrations caused repressively effects on biomass growth of both NH4+-fed and NO3--fed rice seedlings, the nontoxic concentration of KCN supplied can serve as a supplemental N source in plant nutrition and N metabolism.","Li, Cheng-Zhi; Yang, Li; Lin, Yu-Juan; Zhang, Hua; Rad, Saeed; Yu, Xiao-Zhang",Ecotoxicology,4,1

Coronaviruses mainly cause respiratory and digestive tract diseases, several coronaviruses are responsible for porcine diarrhea, such as porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), and emerging swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV). Those viruses have caused huge economic losses and are considered as potential public health threats. Porcine torovirus (PToV) and coronaviruses, sharing similar genomic structure and replication strategy, belong to the same order Nidovirales. Here, we developed a multiplex TaqMan-probe-based real-time PCR for the simultaneous detection of PEDV, PDCoV, PToV, and SADS-CoV for the first time. Specific primers and TaqMan fluorescent probes were designed targeting the ORF1a region of PDEV, PToV, and SADS-CoV and the ORF1b region of PDCoV. The method showed high sensitivity and specificity, with a detection limit of 1 × 102 copies/µL for each pathogen. A total of 101 clinical swine samples with signs of diarrhea were analyzed using this method, and the result showed good consistency with conventional reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR). This method improves the efficiency for surveillance of these emerging and reemerging swine enteric viruses and can help reduce economic losses to the pig industry, which also benefits animal and public health.","Pan, Zhongzhou; Lu, Jiaxuan; Wang, Ningning; He, Wan-Ting; Zhang, Letian; Zhao, Wen; Su, Shuo",Virulence,4,22

We constructed an empirically-based model of serological detection rates to quantify COVID reporting rates in national and sub-national locations. From those reporting rates, we estimated relative COVID burden, finding results that contrast with estimates based on case counts and modeling. To investigate COVID mortality by age in an LMIC context, we utilized a unique morgue study of COVID in Lusaka alongside the population attributable fraction method to account for HIV comorbidity. We calculated the comorbidity-corrected age-adjusted mortality curve in Lusaka and found it significantly skewed toward younger age groups as compared to HICs. This unexpected result recommends against the unexamined use of HIC-derived parameterizations of COVID characteristics in LMIC settings, and challenges the hypothesis of an age-structure protective factor for COVID burden in Africa. Indeed, we found overall COVID burden to be higher in Lusaka than in HICs. Concurrent with high COVID burden, many LMICs have high prevalence of other public health issues such as HIV, which compete for limited health investment resources. Given differences in age-structure, comorbidities, and healthcare delivery costs, we provide a case study comparing the cost efficacy of investment in COVID versus HIV and found that even in a high HIV prevalence setting, investment in COVID remains cost-effective. As a whole, these analyses have broad implications for interpretations of COVID burden, modeling applications, and policy decision-making. Significance StatementThe analyses presented here demonstrate the power of auxiliary COVID data sources to fill information gaps, particularly for LMICs. Our results reveal differences in COVID surveillance and disease dynamics between HICs and LMICs that challenge common perceptions and assumptions about COVID in these respective contexts. We show the divergence of COVID reporting rates between HICs and LMICs and the effects on relative estimated burden. Contradicting common modeling practices, our analysis demonstrates that the age-structure of COVID mortality cannot be accurately generalized from HICs to LMICs. We find higher COVID burden in LMIC contexts than HICs particularly in younger age groups and show that investment in COVID is cost-effective even in light of other public health concerns.","Gordon, Mollie M.

Neutrophils, which orchestrate innate immune responses, worsen TBI outcomes via undefined mechanisms. We hypothesized that formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), a purported mechanism of microbial trapping, exacerbates acute neurological injury after TBI. NET formation coincided with cerebral hypoperfusion and tissue hypoxia after experimental TBI, while elevated circulating NETs correlated with reduced serum deoxyribonuclease-1 (DNase-I) activity in patients with TBI. Functionally, Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and the downstream kinase peptidylarginine deiminase 4 (PAD4) mediated NET formation and cerebrovascular dysfunction after TBI.

Objective: To examine whether remdesivir administered with or without corticosteroids for treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with more rapid clinical improvement in a racially/ethnically diverse population. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective comparative effectiveness research study was conducted from March 4 to August 29, 2020, in a 5-hospital health system in the Baltimore, Maryland, and Washington, DC, area. Of 2483 individuals with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection assessed by polymerase chain reaction, those who received remdesivir were matched to infected individuals who did not receive remdesivir using time-invariant covariates (age, sex, race/ethnicity, Charlson Comorbidity Index, body mass index, and do-not-resuscitate or do-not-intubate orders) and time-dependent covariates (ratio of peripheral blood oxygen saturation to fraction of inspired oxygen, blood pressure, pulse, temperature, respiratory rate, C-reactive protein level, complete white blood cell count, lymphocyte count, albumin level, alanine aminotransferase level, glomerular filtration rate, dimerized plasmin fragment D [D-dimer] level, and oxygen device). An individual in the remdesivir group with k days of treatment was matched to a control patient who stayed in the hospital at least k days (5 days maximum) beyond the matching day. Exposures: Remdesivir treatment with or without corticosteroid administration. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was rate of clinical improvement (hospital discharge or decrease of 2 points on the World Health Organization severity score), and the secondary outcome, mortality at 28 days. An additional outcome was clinical improvement and time to death associated with combined remdesivir and corticosteroid treatment. Results: Of 2483 consecutive admissions, 342 individuals received remdesivir, 184 of whom also received corticosteroids and 158 of whom received remdesivir alone. For these 342 patients, the median age was 60 years (interquartile range, 46-69 years), 189 (55.3%) were men, and 276 (80.7%) self-identified as non-White race/ethnicity. Remdesivir recipients had a shorter time to clinical improvement than matched controls without remdesivir treatment (median, 5.0 days [interquartile range, 4.0-8.0 days] vs 7.0 days [interquartile range, 4.0-10.0 days]; adjusted hazard ratio, 1.47 [95% CI, 1.22-1.79]). Remdesivir recipients had a 28-day mortality rate of 7.7% (22 deaths) compared with 14.0% (40 deaths) among matched controls, but this difference was not statistically significant in the time-to-death analysis (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.38-1.28). The addition of corticosteroids to remdesivir was not associated with a reduced hazard of death at 28 days (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.94; 95% CI, 0.67-5.57). Conclusions and Relevance: In this comparative effectiveness research study of adults hospitalized with COVID-19, receipt of remdesivir was associated with faster clinical improvement in a cohort of predominantly non-White patients. Remdesivir plus corticosteroid administration did not reduce the time to death compared with remdesivir administered alone.","Garibaldi, Brian T; Wang, Kunbo; Robinson, Matthew L; Zeger, Scott L; Bandeen-Roche, Karen; Wang, Mei-Cheng; Alexander, G Caleb; Gupta, Amita; Bollinger, Robert; Xu, Yanxun",JAMA Netw Open,4,30

There was a significant increase in professional SoMe use in the 2021 cohort (80%) compared with the 2018/2019 cohort (44%) (p<0.001). In 2021 compared to 2018/2019, more applicants used SoMe to connect directly with residents (69% vs 34%, p<0.001) and with faculty members (65% vs 15%, p<0.001). Applicants in 2021 compared to 2018/2019 more often found SoMe to be useful for making decisions about applying to (33% vs 10%), interviewing at (26% vs 7%), and ranking programs (20% vs 9%) (all p<0.05). Twitter was the most common platform for applicants to access program information, increasing from 38% to 71%. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic ushered in a period of unprecedented SoMe usage among urology applicants, who used it to learn about and connect with residency programs in new ways. The use of SoMe by residency programs has become an important component of trainee recruitment and is likely to continue in the future.","Ho, Patrick; Margolin, Ezra; Sebesta, Elisabeth; Small, Alexander; Badalato, Gina M",Urology,4,30

In this article, we focus on two jurisdictions with distinct paths of development - England and France - to examine if they have drawn from their own legal history to craft solutions to this challenge and to consider if either has bettersuited tools to address it. Notably, the UK has refrained from intervening in the area of contract law, thus relying on long-standing common law doctrines and equitable remedies, while, in France, the government has intervened with a series of ordonnances providing contracting parties with new tools tackling difficulties of performance, which add to the existing arsenal in the Code civil. The article demonstrates that the responses to the COVID-19 challenge by England and France have historic roots and illustrate important legal cultural differences vis-a vis state intervention in the area of contract in trying times. Moreover, even though, at first glance, parties contracting under French law have more tools balancing freedom of contract and fairness, a closer look reveals that over protection or under protection may lead to the same outcome for contractual relationships on both sides of the Channel. Ultimately, in both countries, parties seem better off settling their disputes themselves, away from the courts.","Pedamon, C.; Vassileva, R.",European Review of Private Law,4,29

To date, there have been no U.S. studies comparing COVID-19 incidence in schools that varied in implementing recommended prevention strategies, including mask requirements and ventilation improvements* (2). Using data from Georgia kindergarten through grade 5 (K-5) schools that opened for in-person learning during fall 2020, CDC and the Georgia Department of Public Health (GDPH) assessed the impact of school-level prevention strategies on incidence of COVID-19 among students and staff members before the availability of COVID-19 vaccines. Among 169 K-5 schools that participated in a survey on prevention strategies and reported COVID-19 cases during November 16-December 11, 2020, COVID-19 incidence was 3.08 cases among students and staff members per 500 enrolled students.§ Adjusting for county-level incidence, COVID-19 incidence was 37% lower in schools that required teachers and staff members to use masks, and 39% lower in schools that improved ventilation, compared with schools that did not use these prevention strategies. Ventilation strategies associated with lower school incidence included methods to dilute airborne particles alone by opening windows, opening doors, or using fans (35% lower incidence), or in combination with methods to filter airborne particles with high-efficiency particulate absorbing (HEPA) filtration with or without purification with ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) (48% lower incidence). Multiple strategies should be implemented to prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in schools (2); mask requirements for teachers and staff members and improved ventilation are important strategies that elementary schools could implement as part of a multicomponent approach to provide safer, in-person learning environments. Universal and correct mask use is still recommended by CDC for adults and children in schools regardless of vaccination status (2).","Gettings, Jenna; Czarnik, Michaila; Morris, Elana; Haller, Elizabeth; Thompson-Paul, Angela M; Rasberry, Catherine; Lanzieri, Tatiana M; Smith-Grant, Jennifer; Aholou, Tiffiany Michelle; Thomas, Ebony; Drenzek, Cherie; MacKellar, Duncan",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,4,21

One reason for this ability is that they adopt a diversity of higher order structures in various eluents, resulting in versatile chiral environments. A potential to extend this versatility further was expected and examined in the present study, based on the recently discovered hysteretic behavior of a widely used chiral selector (CS), amylose tris(3,5-dimethylphenylcarbamate). The hindered transitions of its structure, which are behind the history dependence of its separation ability, were used as a tool to identify distinct states of the chiral selector in order to exploit an extended selectivity space. The identification was carried out using a single diagnostic compound, as opposed to the common approach where testing a library of compounds is required. Eluent mixtures consisting of 2-propanol and either methanol or ethanol were scrutinized in terms of stability and robustness of the observed retentions. The solvent mixtures that were eligible for practical application in these respects were used to construct a screening sequence, including identical compositions combined with different column pretreatment. The gain achievable by using the proposed sequence was then evaluated using 15 enantiomer pairs with focus on resolution, enantiomer elution order and chemoselectivity.","Horváth, Simon; Eke, Zsuzsanna; Németh, Gábor",J Chromatogr A,4,1

This paper aims to explore perceived social support and loneliness and factor associations during the Covid-19 pandemic in a sample of individuals with severe mental ill health. Design/methodology/approachWe sampled an already existing cohort of people with severe mental ill health. Researchers contacted participants by phone or by post to invite them to take part in a survey about how the pandemic restrictions had impacted health, Covid-19 experiences, perceived social support, employment and loneliness. Loneliness was measured by the three item UCLA loneliness scale. FindingsIn the pandemic sub-cohort, 367 adults with a severe mental ill health diagnosis completed a remote survey. 29-34% of participants reported being lonely. Loneliness was associated with being younger in age (adjusted OR = -.98, p = .02), living alone (adjusted OR = 2.04, p = .01), high levels of social and economic deprivation (adjusted OR = 2.49, p = .04), and lower perceived social support (B = -5.86, p < .001). Living alone was associated with lower perceived social support. Being lonely was associated with a self-reported deterioration in mental health during the pandemic (adjusted OR = 3.46, 95%CI 2.03-5.91). Practical implicationsIntervention strategies to tackle loneliness in the severe mental ill health population are needed. Further research is needed to follow-up the severe mental ill health population after pandemic restrictions are lifted to understand perceived social support and loneliness trends. OriginalityLoneliness was a substantial problem for the severe mental ill health population before the Covid-19 pandemic but there is limited evidence to understand perceived social support and loneliness trends during the pandemic.","Heron, Paul N; Spanakis, Panagiotis; Crosland, Suzanne; Johnston, Gordon; Newbronner, Elizabeth; Wadman, Ruth; Walker, Lauren; Gilbody, Simon; Peckham, Emily",,4,21

Early clinical management with limited use of CPAP (3% of patients) was compared with a later clinical management strategy which had a higher proportion of CPAP use (15%). DESIGN: Retrospective case-controlled service evaluation for a single UK National Health Service (NHS) Trust during March-June 2020 designed and conducted solely to estimate the effects of current care. SETTING: The acute inpatient unit in Wrightington, Wigan and Leigh Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, a medium-sized English NHS Trust. PARTICIPANTS: 206 patients with antigen confirmed COVID-19 disease and severe acute respiratory syndrome admitted between 17 March 2020 and 3 April 2020 for the early group (controls), and between 10 April 2020 and 11 May 2020 for the late group (cases). Follow-up for all cases was until 11 June by which time all patients had a final outcome of death or discharge. Both groups were composed of 103 patients. Cases and controls were matched by age and sex. OUTCOME MEASURE: The outcome measure was the proportion of patients surviving at time t (time from the positive result of COVID-19 test to discharge/death date). The predictors were CPAP intervention, intubation, residence in care homes and comorbidities (renal, pulmonary, cardiac, hypertension and diabetes). A stratified Cox proportional hazard for clustered data (via generalised estimating equations) and model selection algorithms were employed to identify the effect of CPAP on patients' survival and the effect on gas exchange as measured by alveolar arterial (A-a) gradient and timing of CPAP treatment on CPAP patients' survival. RESULTS: CPAP was found to be significantly (HR 0.38, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.40) associated with lower risk of death in patients with hospital stay equal to, or below 7 days. However, for longer hospitalisation CPAP was found to be associated with increased risk of death (HR 1.72, 95% CI 1.40 to 2.12). When CPAP was initiated within 4 days of hospital admission, the survival probability was above 73% (95% CI 53% to 99%). In addition, lower A-a gradient was associated with lower risk of death in CPAP patients (HR 1.011, 95% CI 1.010 to 1.013). The selected model (best fit) was stratified by sex and clustered by case/control groups. The predictors were age, intubation, hypertension and the residency from care homes, which were found to be statistically significantly associated with patient's death/discharge. CONCLUSIONS: CPAP is a simple and cost-effective intervention. It has been established for care of other respiratory disorders but not for COVID-19 respiratory failure. This evaluation establishes that CPAP as a potentially viable treatment option for this group of patients during the first days of hospital admission. As yet there is limited availability of quantitative research on CPAP use for COVID-19. Whist this work is hampered by both the relatively small sample size and retrospective design (which reduced the ability to control potential confounders), it represents evidence of the significant benefit of early CPAP intervention. This evaluation should stimulate further research questions and larger study designs on the potential benefit of CPAP for COVID-19 infections. Globally, this potentially beneficial low cost and low intensity therapy could have added significance economically for healthcare provision in less developed countries.","Ashish, Abdul; Unsworth, Alison; Martindale, Jane; Sundar, Ram; Kavuri, Kanishka; Sedda, Luigi; Farrier, Martin",,4,16

However, the performance of existing CAD for identifying COVID-19 and associated pneumonia on CXRs has been scarcely investigated. In this study, CXRs of patients with and without COVID-19 confirmed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were retrospectively collected from four and one institution, respectively, and a commercialized, regulatory-approved CAD that can identify various abnormalities including pneumonia was used to analyze each CXR. Performance of the CAD was evaluated using area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs), with reference standards of the RT-PCR results and the presence of findings of pneumonia on chest CTs obtained within 24 hours from the CXR. For comparison, 5 thoracic radiologists and 5 non-radiologist physicians independently interpreted the CXRs. Afterward, they re-interpreted the CXRs with corresponding CAD results. The performance of CAD (AUCs, 0.714 and 0.790 against RT-PCR and chest CT, respectively hereinafter) were similar with those of thoracic radiologists (AUCs, 0.701 and 0.784), and higher than those of non-radiologist physicians (AUCs, 0.584 and 0.650). Non-radiologist physicians showed significantly improved performance when assisted with the CAD (AUCs, 0.584 to 0.664 and 0.650 to 0.738). In addition, inter-reader agreement among physicians was also improved in the CAD-assisted interpretation (Fleiss' kappa coefficient, 0.209 to 0.322). In conclusion, radiologist-level performance of the CAD in identifying COVID-19 and associated pneumonia on CXR and enhanced performance of non-radiologist physicians with the CAD assistance suggest that the CAD can support physicians in interpreting CXRs and helping image-based triage of COVID-19 patients in resource-constrained environment.","Hwang, Eui Jin; Kim, Ki Beom; Kim, Jin Young; Lim, Jae-Kwang; Nam, Ju Gang; Choi, Hyewon; Kim, Hyungjin; Yoon, Soon Ho; Goo, Jin Mo; Park, Chang Min",PLoS One,4,16

This paper investigates the consumers’ attitude and perception of TFs of northwest Greece in order to assess the possible impact of the pandemic toward the consumption of this kind of food. A questionnaire survey of self-response was carried out in fall 2020 on a sample of 510 participants through the Google platform. To analyze the data, basic descriptive statistical tools were used, combined with crosstabs and chi-square tests. The results revealed that the participants know the regional TFs well, continue to choose them due to a number of reasons, which include: the quality to price ratio, being local products with local raw materials, the nutritional properties, the social impact, as well as their positive impact to the regional economy and promotion. They buy them primarily from the supermarkets. They would recommend them to others, and they have increased their consumption during the pandemic, even though they consider their marketing inadequate, and they do not purchase them through the Internet yet. They believe that consumers in other regions of Greece would buy them if they had access to them. The foods of choice are traditional cheese and other dairy products, followed by wines, and aromatic herbs, which are the main regional TFs. These results indicate that the COVID-19 crisis has not interfered in consumers’ attitudes and perceptions regarding TFs;therefore, they have the potential to expand and grow further in the future. In fact, they can play a vital role as major economic drivers in the post-COVID-19 era for the regional and local economies of Europe and elsewhere.","Skalkos, Dimitris Kosma Ioanna S.; Chasioti, Eleni Skendi Adriana Papageorgiou Maria Guiné Raquel P.

O estudo sobre dados de inspeção de abate apresenta o potencial do uso dos dados de condenação de carcaça como indicadores em um programa de monitoramento de bem-estar, desde que o órgão competente harmonize o procedimento de inspeção entre os Estados, defina os indicadores específicos a serem monitorados e integre dados de condenação, transporte e das granjas. O capítulo sobre a proposta de criação de um sistema de gerenciamento de bem-estar animal adaptou o método de Análise de Perigos e Pontos Críticos de Controle para fins de bem-estar, com potencial para redução a médio e longo prazo de problemas por meio de ações corretivas e preventivas; bem como possibilitou a inclusão das discussões de bem-estar em níveis corporativos mais altos nas empresas. No capítulo sobre o desenvolvimento e refinamento de indicadores, sujidade de aves foi refinado como um indicador de bem-estar de frangos de corte e dois indicadores adicionais, dermatite de contato das áreas de peito e abdômen e arranhadura de carcaça, foram desenvolvidos e testados. Os indicadores foram confiáveis entre os avaliadores e os resultados identificaram que os problemas eram prevalentes entre as aves avaliadas. O capítulo sobre o uso de escalas ordinal e visual analógica evidenciou que ambas escalas eram confiáveis e que a escala ordinal não se apresenta equidistante quando é medida pela escala visual analógica para os indicadores estudados. O estudo sobre avaliação qualitativa do comportamento demonstrou que a lista é confiável para avaliar as qualidades do comportamento que expressam emoções em frangos. A presente tese contribuiu com meios para que tomadores de decisão possam planejar ações em direção a uma agenda positiva para o bem-estar de frangos de corte. O resultado desejado desta tese é a produção de dados confiáveis para informar a sociedade a respeito das condições de bem-estar de frangos de corte, promovendo transparência dos processos e permitindo reais melhorias para os animais.","SOUZA, ANA PAULA DE OLIVEIRA",,4,1

Tea tree oil (TTO) has been demonstrated to exhibit a wide range of pharmacological actions that can effectively inhibit the activity of bacteria. In this context, we evaluated the in vitro antimicrobial effects of TTO on S. mutans both during planktonic growth and in biofilms compared with 0.2% CHX. We determined the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) using the microdilution method, the bacteriostatic rate using an MTT assay, and the antimicrobial time using a time-kill assay. Then, we explored the effects of TTO on acid production and cell integrity. Furthermore, the effects of TTO on the biomass and bacterial activity of S. mutans biofilms were studied. Finally, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) were used to investigate the structure and activity of biofilms. The MIC and MBC values were 0.125% and 0.25%, and the bacterial inhibition rate was concentration dependent. TTO can effectively inhibit bacterial acid production and destroy the integrity of the cell membrane. Electron micrographs revealed a reduction in bacterial aggregation, inhibited biofilm formation, and reduced biofilm thickness. The effect of TTO was the same as that of 0.2% CHX at a specific concentration. In summary, we suggest that TTO is a potential anticariogenic agent that can be used against S. mutans.","Song, Yu-Meng; Zhou, Hong-Yan; Wu, Ye; Wang, Jue; Liu, Qian; Mei, Yu-Feng",AAPS PharmSciTech,4,1

This study as a part of ECEALHBA's Project, reports the consequences of COVID-19 pandemic over 2020-21 bronchiolitis epidemic period in the Central and Eastern regions of Spain. METHOD: Multicenter, observational, descriptive and ambispective study of admitted infants with the diagnosis of bronchiolitis in 16 Spanish hospitals involved in the investigation project. Five epidemic periods previous to COVID-19 pandemic, from 2015 to 2020, were compared with the current one, 2020-21, in both a qualitative and quantitative manner. RESULTS: Total of 4,643 infants were admitted to the participating hospitals along the study period. Pandemic season hospital admissions for bronchiolitis were 94.1% lower than in pre-pandemic period. December and January were peak months for bronchiolitis admissions during pre-pandemic period, but September was the peak month during pandemic year. There was a progressive decrease of admissions from this moment until the end of the follow up, in April 2021. Rhinovirus has been the commonest etiology for bronchiolitis in 2020-21 epidemic period of bronchiolitis. CONCLUSIONS: Some of the non-pharmaceutical interventions initiated because of COVID-19 pandemic are probably related to the dramatic decrease of bronchiolitis cases in 2020-21 season. It would be rewarding to purpose novel research to clarify how these simple interventions can be useful, close to vaccines and antiviral drugs, to achieve the goal of avoiding the spread of respiratory viruses in pediatric population.","Rius-Peris, Juan Manuel; Lucas-García, Jesús; García-Peris, Mónica; Tomás, Pascual Escrivá; Manuel Sequí-Canet, José; de Dios, Javier González",An. pediatr.

First emerging in China, it has spread rapidly across the globe, giving rise to significant social and economic costs and imposing severe strain on healthcare systems. Since many attempts to control viral spread has been futile, the only old practice of containment including city lockdown and social distancing are working to some extent. Unfortunately, specific antiviral drugs and vaccines remain un-available yet. Many factors are encountered to play essential roles in viral pathogenesis. These include a broad viral-host range with high receptor binding affinity to various human tissues, viral adaptation to humans, a high percentage of asymptomatic but infected carriers, prolonged incubation, and viral shedding periods. There are also a wide variety of pulmonary and extrapul-monary tissue damage mechanisms including direct cell injury or immune-mediated damages involving the immune cells, upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines, and antibody dependent enhancement that can result in multi-organ failure. In this article, we summarise some evidence on the various steps in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and immune evasion strategies to assess their contribution to our understanding of unresolved problems related to SARS-CoV-2 prevention, control, and treatment protocols.","Abdullah, Shatha F.; Sharquie, Inas K.",Medeniyet Med.

Thus, the only feasible solution for prevention relies on the detection of COVID-19-positive cases through quick and accurate testing. Since artificial intelligence (AI) offers the powerful mechanism to automatically extract the tissue features and characterise the disease, we therefore hypothesise that AI-based strategies can provide quick detection and classification, especially for radiological computed tomography (CT) lung scans. METHODOLOGY: Six models, two traditional machine learning (ML)-based (k-NN and RF), two transfer learning (TL)-based (VGG19 and InceptionV3), and the last two were our custom-designed deep learning (DL) models (CNN and iCNN), were developed for classification between COVID pneumonia (CoP) and non-COVID pneumonia (NCoP). K10 cross-validation (90% training: 10% testing) protocol on an Italian cohort of 100 CoP and 30 NCoP patients was used for performance evaluation and bispectrum analysis for CT lung characterisation. RESULTS: Using K10 protocol, our results showed the accuracy in the order of DL > TL > ML, ranging the six accuracies for k-NN, RF, VGG19, IV3, CNN, iCNN as 74.58 ± 2.44%, 96.84 ± 2.6, 94.84 ± 2.85%, 99.53 ± 0.75%, 99.53 ± 1.05%, and 99.69 ± 0.66%, respectively. The corresponding AUCs were 0.74, 0.94, 0.96, 0.99, 0.99, and 0.99 (p-values < 0.0001), respectively. Our Bispectrum-based characterisation system suggested CoP can be separated against NCoP using AI models. COVID risk severity stratification also showed a high correlation of 0.7270 (p < 0.0001) with clinical scores such as ground-glass opacities (GGO), further validating our AI models. CONCLUSIONS: We prove our hypothesis by demonstrating that all the six AI models successfully classified CoP against NCoP due to the strong presence of contrasting features such as ground-glass opacities (GGO), consolidations, and pleural effusion in CoP patients. Further, our online system takes < 2 s for inference.","Saba, Luca; Agarwal, Mohit; Patrick, Anubhav; Puvvula, Anudeep; Gupta, Suneet K; Carriero, Alessandro; Laird, John R; Kitas, George D; Johri, Amer M; Balestrieri, Antonella; Falaschi, Zeno; Paschè, Alessio; Viswanathan, Vijay; El-Baz, Ayman; Alam, Iqbal; Jain, Abhinav; Naidu, Subbaram; Oberleitner, Ronald; Khanna, Narendra N; Bit, Arindam; Fatemi, Mostafa; Alizad, Azra; Suri, Jasjit S",Int J Comput Assist Radiol Surg,4,1

In this paper, we describe our experience with 200 maintenance hemodialysis patients in a hemodialysis center that employed universal RT-PCR testing, including 38 COVID-positive patients. Study Design: Descriptive observational cohort, including the timeline of patient diagnoses along with contextual events including precautions, testing, screening algorithms, clinical diagnostics and therapy, as well as the clinical course of the COVID infected patients and their final outcomes. Setting & Participants: 200 patients within a single hemodialysis center with two dialysis clinics in Paris. Results: Among 200 maintenance hemodialysis patients, 38 (19%) were diagnosed with COVID-19; of these, 15 (39.5%) were admitted to the hospital including four who required intensive care unit (ICU) care. There were 8 deaths (21%). The most common symptom was fever, followed by dry cough, fatigue and dyspnea. All COVID-19 patients had lymphopenia and an increase of C-reactive protein. The median time from the onset of respiratory symptoms to ICU admission was one to two days. The duration of non-ICU hospitalization and of ICU stays was 7 and 13 days, respectively. Limitations: Retrospective study, single HD center. Conclusions: Dialysis patients are a highly susceptible population and hemodialysis centers are a high-risk area in a COVID-19 epidemic. ""Unexplained"" lymphopenia and/or a rise in C-reactive protein should lead physicians to the diagnosis of COVID-19, and should, when possible, be followed by diagnostic testing with universal RT-PCR as well as the reinforcement of contamination barrier measures.","Creput, Caroline; Fumeron, Christine; Toledano, Daniel; Diaconita, Mirela; Izzedine, Hassan",,4,0

After cochlear implantation, auditory training is necessary for the brain to adapt to new auditory signals transmitted by the cochlear implant (CI). To date, auditory training is conducted in a face-to-face setting at a specialized center. However, because of the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on health care, the need for new therapeutic settings has intensified. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study are to assess the feasibility of a novel teletherapeutic auditory rehabilitation platform in adult CI recipients and compare the clinical outcomes and economic benefits of this platform with those derived from conventional face-to-face rehabilitation settings in a clinic. METHODS: In total, 20 experienced adult CI users with a mean age of 59.4 (SD 16.3) years participated in the study. They completed 3 weeks of standard (face-to-face) therapy, followed by 3 weeks of computer-based auditory training (CBAT) at home. Participants were assessed at three intervals: before face-to-face therapy, after face-to-face therapy, and after CBAT. The primary outcomes were speech understanding in quiet and noisy conditions. The secondary outcomes were the usability of the CBAT system, the participants' subjective rating of their own listening abilities, and the time required for completing face-to-face and CBAT sessions for CI users and therapists. RESULTS: Greater benefits were observed after CBAT than after standard therapy in nearly all speech outcome measures. Significant improvements were found in sentence comprehension in noise (P=.004), speech tracking (P=.004) and phoneme differentiation (vowels: P=.001; consonants: P=.02) after CBAT. Only speech tracking improved significantly after conventional therapy (P=.007). The program's usability was judged to be high: only 2 of 20 participants could not imagine using the program without support. The different features of the training platform were rated as high. Cost analysis showed a cost difference in favor of CBAT: therapists spent 120 minutes per week face-to-face and 30 minutes per week on computer-based sessions. For CI users, attending standard therapy required an average of approximately 78 (SD 58.6) minutes of travel time per appointment. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed teletherapeutic approach for hearing rehabilitation enables good clinical outcomes while saving time for CI users and clinicians. The promising speech understanding results might be due to the high satisfaction of users with the CBAT program. Teletherapy might offer a cost-effective solution to address the lack of human resources in health care as well as the global challenge of current or future pandemics.","Völter, Christiane; Stöckmann, Carolin; Schirmer, Christiane; Dazert, Stefan",JMIR Rehabil Assist Technol,4,24

OBJECTIVE: To assess the risk of hospitalization (as a marker of severe COVID-19) in patients by smoking status: former, current and never smokers, who tested positive for the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV2) at an academic medical center in the United States. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study in patients with SARS-COV2 between March-1-2020 and January-31-2021 to identify the risk of hospitalization due to COVID-19 by smoking status. RESULTS: We identified 10216 SARS-COV2-positive patients with complete documentation of smoking habits. Within 14 days of a SARS-COV2 positive test, 1150 (11.2%) patients were admitted and 188 (1.8%) died. Significantly more former smokers were hospitalized from COVID-19 than current or never smokers (21.2% former smokers; 7.3% current smokers; 10.4% never smokers, p<0.0001). In univariable analysis, former smokers had higher odds of hospitalization from COVID-19 than never smokers (OR 2.31; 95% CI 1.94-2.74). This association remained significant when analysis was adjusted for age, race and gender (OR 1.28; 95% CI 1.06-1.55), but became non-significant when analysis included Body Mass Index, previous hospitalization and number of comorbidities (OR 1.05; 95% CI 0.86-1.29). In contrast, current smokers were less likely than never smokers to be hospitalized due to COVID-19.

The objective of this study was to determine the efficacy of new patient orthopedic surgery ambulatory encounters performed using telemedicine during the early phase of the COVID-19 crisis. Failure of the telemedicine encounter was assessed in this study by 2 separate criteria: (1) an unplanned visit to the emergency department (ED) within 6 weeks of the telemedicine encounter and (2) a planned subsequent in-person encounter for inability to formulate a complete diagnosis virtually. The authors retrospectively identified all new patient orthopedic surgery ambulatory encounters performed using telemedicine in the orthopedic surgery department of an academic tertiary care center during the first 6 weeks of the COVID-19 response, from March 16, 2020, to April 26, 2020. The study cohort included 298 new patients treated by 41 providers. The mean age of the 298 patients was 48 years, and 59% were women. Two hundred encounters were performed with video, and 98 were performed with telephone only. Three (1%) patients presented to the ED within 6 weeks of their new patient telemedicine encounter, and 8 (3%) patients presented for a planned in-person encounter. The authors concluded that new patient orthopedic surgery ambulatory encounters performed using telemedicine were able to effectively direct patients to a variety of treatments and dispositions, with a low rate of unplanned presentation to the ED or need for supplementary in-person assessment.

The lack of COVID-19 testing capacity threatens the ability of both the United States (US) and low middle income countries (LMIC) to respond to this growing threat, The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness through participant self-assessment of a rapid response team (RRT) mobile laboratory curriculum METHODS: We conducted a pre and post survey for the purpose of a process improvement assessment in Angola, involving 32 individuals. The survey was performed before and after a 14-day training workshop held in Luanda, Angola, in December 2019. A paired t-test was used to identify any significant change on six 7-point Likert scale questions with &#945;< 0.05 (95% confidence interval). RESULTS: All six of the questions - 1) ""I feel confident managing a real laboratory sample test for Ebola or other highly contagious sample;"" 2) ""I feel safe working in the lab environment during a real scenario;"" 3) ""I feel as if I can appropriately manage a potentially highly contagious laboratory sample;"" 4)""I feel that I can interpret a positive or negative sample during a suspected contagious outbreak;"" 5) ""I understand basic Biobubble/mobile laboratory concepts and procedures;"" and 6) ""I understand polymerase chain reaction (PCR) principles"" - showed statistical significant change pre and post training. Additionally, the final two questions - ""I can more effectively perform my role/position because of the training I received during this course;"" and ""This training was valuable"" - received high scores on the Likert scale. CONCLUSION: This Angolan RRT mobile laboratory training curriculum provides the nation of Angola with the confidence to rapidly respond and test at the national level a highly infectious contagion in the region and perform on-scene diagnostics. This mobile RRT laboratory provides a mobile and rapid diagnostic resource when epidemic/pandemic resource allocation may need to be prioritized based on confirmed disease prevalence.","Owens, Michael D; Lloyd, Michael L; Brady, Tyler M; Gross, Robin",West J Emerg Med,4,24

With the rapid integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into the healthcare field the future care of our patients will depend on the decisions we make now. Demographic healthcare inequalities continue to persist worldwide and the impact of medical biases on different patient groups is still being uncovered by the research community. At a time when clinical AI systems are scaled up in response to the Covid19 pandemic, the role of AI in exacerbating health disparities must be critically reviewed. For AI to account for the past and build a better future, we must first unpack the present and create a new baseline on which to develop these tools. The means by which we move forwards will determine whether we project existing inequity into the future, or whether we reflect on what we hold to be true and challenge ourselves to be better.

Reports exist regarding the potential benefits of undertaking mobile radiography through side room windows. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact on image quality and exposure factors when undertaking such examinations. METHODS: A phantom based study was undertaken using a digital X-ray room. Control acquisitions, using a commercially available image quality test tool, were performed using standard mobile chest radiography acquisition factors. Image quality (physical and visual), incidence surface air kerma (ISAK), Exposure Index (EI) and Deviation Index (DI) were recorded. Image quality and radiation dose were further assessed for two additional (experimental) scenarios, where a side room window was located immediately adjacent to the exit port of the light beam diaphragm. The goal of experimental scenario one was to modify exposure factors to maintain the control ISAK. The goal of experimental scenario two was to modify exposure factors to maintain the control EI and DI. Dose and image quality data were compared between the three scenarios. RESULTS: To maintain the pre-window (control) ISAK (76 µGy), tube output needed a three-fold increase (90 kV/4 mAs versus 90 kV/11.25 mAs). To maintain EI/DI a more modest increase in tube output was required (90 kV/8 mAs/ISAK 54 µGy). Physical and visual assessments of spatial resolution and signal-to-noise ratio were indifferent between the three scenarios. There was a slight statistically significant reduction in contrast-to-noise ratio when imaging through the glass window (2.3 versus 1.4 and 1.2; P = 0.005). CONCLUSION: Undertaking mobile X-ray examinations through side room windows is potentially feasible but does require an increase in tube output and is likely to be limited by minor reductions in image quality. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Mobile examinations performed through side room windows should only be used in limited circumstances and future clinical evaluation of this technique is warranted.","England, A; Littler, E; Romani, S; Cosson, P",,4,29

As no approved therapeutics exists to treat COVID-19, the disease associated to SARS-Cov-2, there is an urgent need to propose molecules that could quickly enter into clinics. Repurposing of approved drugs is a strategy that can bypass the time-consuming stages of drug development. In this study, we screened the PRESTWICK CHEMICAL LIBRARY composed of 1,520 approved drugs in an infected cell-based assay. The robustness of the screen was assessed by the identification of drugs that already demonstrated in vitro antiviral effect against SARS-CoV-2. Thereby, 90 compounds were identified as positive hits from the screen and were grouped according to their chemical composition and their known therapeutic effect. Then EC50 and CC50 were determined for a subset of 15 compounds from a panel of 23 selected drugs covering the different groups. Eleven compounds such as macrolides antibiotics, proton pump inhibitors, antiarrhythmic agents or CNS drugs emerged showing antiviral potency with 2 < EC50 &#8804; 20 µM. By providing new information on molecules inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro, this study provides information for the selection of drugs to be further validated in vivo.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to describe alcohol-related content posted by mothers on Instagram during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Using two popular hashtags, #momjuice and #winemom, 50 Instagram posts on each were collected from the ""top posts"" tab. The coding categories were created inductively and were as follows: displays alcohol (drinking/holding alcohol or alcohol itself), person is making alcoholic beverages, type of alcohol featured or discussed, highlights anxiety and/or depression/mental state, highlights struggling (in general), highlights parenting challenges, encourages alcohol consumption, discourages alcohol consumption, features a person wearing clothing or shows products promoting alcohol, promotes alcohol rehabilitation, highlights caffeine to alcohol daily transition throughout the day, and highlights other drugs besides caffeine and alcohol. RESULTS: Overall, the 100 selected posts had a total of 5108 comments and 94,671 likes. The respective averages were 51.08 (SD 77.94) and 946.71 (SD 1731.72). A majority (>50%) of the posts reviewed encouraged alcohol consumption (n=66) and/or displayed alcohol (n=56). Of the 66 that encouraged and/or displayed alcohol, the common type of alcohol discussed or featured was wine (n=55). Only 6 posts discouraged alcohol use and only 4 provided the audience with a disclaimer. None of the videos promoted or endorsed alcohol rehabilitation in any way. Only 37 posts highlighted struggle. However, these posts garnered more than a majority of the likes (n=50,034, 52.3%). Posts that showed struggle received an average of 1359.57 (SD 2108.02) likes. Those that did not show struggle had an average of 704.24 (SD 1447.46) likes. An independent one-tailed t test demonstrated this difference to be statistically significant (P=.0499). CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this investigation suggest that though these hashtags ostensibly exist to valorize excess alcohol consumption, they may be serving as a support system for mothers who are experiencing increased burdens and role stress during the pandemic. Given the strains placed on mothers overall and especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, efforts must be taken to increase access to and affordability of telehealth-based mental health care.","Basch, Corey H; Meleo-Erwin, Zoe C; Mohlman, Jan; Fera, Joseph; Quinones, Nasia",JMIR Pediatr Parent,4,20

India had initiated a nationwide lockdown to combat the pandemic starting from the last week of March until the end of May 2020. But, the lockdown had continued subsequently in several red zones across parts of the country for few months. However, scientists have criticized the government's abrupt lockdown since it prevented people from preparing for the worst aftermath. Besides, the curfews have blocked millions of impoverished migrant workers from leaving cities to return to their homes in distant rural villages. As a result, the destitute workers have endured enormous hardship and outright discrimination desolately leading to their added physical and mental distress, pain, suffering, and death. Most of the victims of the lockdown have belonged to the economically distressed lower social classes of the Indian caste hierarchy. This article outlines their sufferings triggered by the long drawn-out lockdown episode.","Agoramoorthy, Govindasamy; Hsu, Minna J",J. racial ethnic health disparities (Internet),4,11

Herein, we report a relatively new presentation. A patient in the convalescence period following a febrile illness with lower respiratory tract infection (fever, myalgia, nonproductive cough) presented with generalized disabling myoclonus, which is phenotypically suggestive of brainstem origin, along with additional truncal cerebellar ataxia. His neurology work-ups, such as brain MRI, electroencephalography, serum autoimmune and paraneoplastic antibody testing, were normal. His CT chest scan revealed right lower lung infiltrates, and serological and other laboratory testing did not show evidence of active infection. COVID-19 titers turned out to be strongly positive, suggestive of post-COVID-19 lung sequelae. He responded partially to antimyoclonic drugs and fully to a course of steroids, suggesting a para- or postinfectious immune-mediated pathophysiology. Myoclonusataxia syndrome appears to be a neurological manifestation of COVID-19 infection, and knowledge regarding this phenomenon should be increased among clinicians for better patient care in a pandemic situation.","Shetty, Kuldeep; Jadhav, Atul Manchakrao; Jayanthakumar, Ranjith; Jamwal, Seema; Shanubhogue, Tejaswini; Reddy, Mallepalli Prabhakar; Dash, Gopal Krishna; Manohar, Radhika; Philip, Vivek Jacob; Huded, Vikram",,4,1

The causative agent of this acute respiratory disease is a newly emerged coronavirus, named SARS-CoV-2, which originated in China in late 2019. Exposure to SARS-CoV-2 leads to multifaceted disease outcomes from asymptomatic infection to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress and potentially death. Understanding the host immune response is crucial for the development of interventional strategies. Humoral responses play an important role in defending viral infections and are therefore of particular interest. With the aim to resolve SARS-CoV-2-specific humoral immune responses at the epitope level, we screened clinically well-characterized sera from COVID-19 patients with mild and severe disease outcome using high-density peptide microarrays covering the entire proteome of SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, we determined the longevity of epitope-specific antibody responses in a longitudinal approach. Here we present IgG and IgA-specific epitope signatures from COVID-19 patients, which may serve as discriminating prognostic or predictive markers for disease outcome and/or could be relevant for intervention strategies.","Schwarz, Tatjana; Heiss, Kirsten; Mahendran, Yuvaraj; Casilag, Fiordiligie; Kurth, Florian; Sander, Leif E; Wendtner, Clemens-Martin; Hoechstetter, Manuela A; Müller, Marcel A; Sekul, Renate; Drosten, Christian; Stadler, Volker; Corman, Victor M",Front Immunol,4,10

Bedside flexible fiberoptic endoscopy was performed and did not reveal a foreign body in the nasopharynx or larynx. Subsequent computed tomography (CT) scan demonstrated the radiopaque retained foreign body at the distal gastroesophageal junction. The patient remained asymptomatic and did not have any upper airway or gastrointestinal symptoms. This unique case demonstrates a potential risk associated with SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal swab testing and highlights management strategies that serve the patient while adequately protecting health care providers. A standardized approach to evaluation optimally includes bedside flexible endoscopy with appropriate personal protective equipment, prompt airway evaluation if aspiration is suspected, and noncontrasted CT imaging if the known foreign body is not identified via other modalities.","Stevens, Madelyn N; Lin, George T; Tittman, Sarah M; Motz, Kevin M",Ear Nose Throat J,4,21

COVID-19 is a viral respiratory infection, yet the clinical characteristics of this infection differ in spinal cord injury patients from those observed in the general population. Cough and asthenia are the most frequent symptoms in this population. Moreover, infected spinal cord injury patients rarely present complications that require admission to an Intensive Care Unit, in contrast to the general population. Thus, there is a clear need to understand how COVID-19 affects spinal cord injury patients from a molecular perspective. Here, we employed an -omics strategy in order to identify variations in protein abundance in spinal cord injury patients with and without COVID-19. After a quantitative differential analysis using isobaric tags and mass spectrometry and a verification phase, we have found differences mainly related to coagulation and platelet activation. Our results suggest a key role of heparin in the response of spinal cord injury patients to COVID-19 infection, showing a significant correlation between these proteins and heparin dose.

Risk factors for severe illness must be identified to make efficient resource allocations. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate risk factors for severe illness. DESIGN: Retrospective, observational case series. SETTING: Single-institution. PARTICIPANTS: First 117 consecutive patients hospitalized for Covid-19 from March 1 to April 12, 2020. EXPOSURE: None. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Intensive care unit admission or death. RESULTS: In-hospital mortality was 24.8% and average total length of stay was 11.82 days (95% CI: 10.01 to 13.63 days). 30.8% of patients required intensive care unit admission and 29.1% required mechanical ventilation. Multivariate regression identified the amount of supplemental oxygen required at admission (OR: 1.208, 95% CI: 1.011-1.443, p = .037), sputum production (OR: 6.734, 95% CI: 1.630-27.812, p = .008), insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (OR: 11.873, 95% CI: 2.218-63.555, p = .004) and chronic kidney disease (OR: 4.793, 95% CI: 1.528-15.037, p = .007) as significant risk factors for intensive care unit admission or death. Of the 48 patients who were admitted to the intensive care unit or died, this occurred within 3 days of arrival in 42%, within 6 days in 71%, and within 9 days in 88% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: At our regional medical center, patients with Covid-19 had an average length of stay just under 12 days, required ICU care in 31% of cases, and had a 25% mortality rate. Patients with increased sputum production and higher supplemental oxygen requirements at admission, and insulin dependent diabetes or chronic kidney disease may be at increased risk for severe illness. A model for predicting intensive care unit admission or death with excellent discrimination was created that may aid in treatment decisions and resource allocation. Early identification of patients at increased risk for severe illness may lead to improved outcomes in patients hospitalized with Covid-19.","Turcotte, Justin J; Meisenberg, Barry R; MacDonald, James H; Menon, Nandakumar; Fowler, Marcia B; West, Michaline; Rhule, Jane; Qureshi, Sadaf S; MacDonald, Eileen B",PLoS One,4,32

We aimed to analyze the changes in pediatric ED visits during the COVID-19 pandemic and examine the relationship between the number of ED visits and the stringency of government social distancing measures. METHODS: This multicenter retrospective study used data of pediatric (age < 18 years) ED visits in Seoul metropolitan area from June 1, 2018, to May 31, 2020. Patient demographics, ED results, and diagnoses were compared during the COVID-19 period and the previous year. To evaluate the effect of the stringency of social distancing measures on the number of ED visits, a Poisson regression model was developed with month, year, and the average monthly Government Response Stringency Index (GRSI) as fixed effects. RESULTS: In total, 190,732 patients were included. The number of pediatric ED visits during the COVID-19 period was 58.1% lower than in the previous year. There were disproportionate decreases in the numbers of ED visits for children in early childhood (66.5%), low-acuity children (55.2-63.8%), those who did not use an ambulance (59.0%), and those visiting the ED for noninjury complaints (64.9%). The proportion of admissions increased from 11.9% to 16.6%. For every 10-point increase in the GRSI, there was a 15.1% decrease in monthly ED visits. CONCLUSION: A striking decrease in pediatric ED visits was observed during the COVID-19 outbreak, the scale which was associated with the stringency of government policies. Changes in the number and characteristics of children visiting the ED should be considered to facilitate the effective operation of EDs during the pandemic.","Choi, Dong Hyun; Jung, Jae Yun; Suh, Dongbum; Choi, Jea Yeon; Lee, Se Uk; Choi, Yoo Jin; Kwak, Young Ho; Kim, Do Kyun",J Korean Med Sci,4,1

Past research suggests that boredom depends on specific cognitive appraisals, such as how people can control the task and how much they value it. Research further suggests that boredom is related to negative academic outcomes such as lower grades and a higher risk of dropping out. Here, we tested a mediation model on 324 pre-service teachers during the first lockdown of 2020 in Switzerland to assess (1) how control and value predicted boredom, and (2) how boredom was related to the intention to persist at university. We hypothesized that (1) the more participants felt lacking in control and low in value, the higher their boredom and (2) the more intense their boredom, the lower their intention to persist. We further hypothesized that both control and value would be positively related to the intention to persist, and this link may be mediated by boredom. Our results provide partial support for our mediation model as we found a significant indirect link between control and intention to persist through boredom. More specifically, the more participants lost control over their studies, the more they felt bored, which in turn was negatively related to their intention to persist.","Audrin, Catherine; Hascoët, Marine",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),4,16

Overall, this study contributes to the literature by evaluating the unintended consequences of the COVID-19 outbreak for air quality, and provides timely policy implications for policymakers.","Liu, Shasha; Kong, Gaowen; Kong, Dongmin",Environ Resour Econ (Dordr),4,1

Not much is known about the change of public responses to containment measures from the initial outbreak to resurgence. Monitoring public responses is crucial to inform policy measures to prepare for COVID-19 resurgence. OBJECTIVE: To assess and compare public responses towards containment measures during the initial outbreak and resurgence of COVID-19 epidemic in China. METHODS: We collected all COVID-19 related posts from Sina Weibo (China's Twitter) during the initial outbreak in China and resurgence in Beijing. With a Python script, we constructed subsets of Weibo posts focusing on three containment measures: lockdown, test-trace-isolate, and suspension of gatherings. Baidu's open source sentiment analysis model, and Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic modeling, a widely-used machine learning algorithm, were used to assess the public's engagement, sentiment, and frequently discussed topics on each containment measure. RESULTS: A total of 8,985,221 Weibo posts were collected. In China, the containment measures evolved from the fully lockdown for general population during the initial outbreak, to a more targeted response strategy for high-risk population during COVID-19 resurgence. Between the initial outbreak and resurgence, average daily proportion of Weibo posts with negative sentiments decreased from 57% to 47% for lockdown, from 56% to 51% for test-trace-isolate, and from 55% to 48% for suspension of gathering. Among the top 3 frequently discussed topics on lockdown measure, discussions on containment measures accounting for around 32% in both periods, but the second top topic shifted from expressing negative emotions (11%) to its impacts on daily lives or work (26%). The public expressed the high level of panic (21%) in the initial outbreak but virtually zero panic (1%) in the resurgence. The more targeted test-trace-isolation measure got the greatest support (60%) among all three containment measures in the initial outbreak, and its supporting rate reached 90% during the resurgence. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to the initial outbreak, the public expressed less engagement and less negative sentiment on containment measures, and were more supportive towards containment measures during the resurgence. The targeted test-trace-isolate strategies were more acceptable for the public. When COVID-19 resurges, more targeted test-trace-isolate strategies for high-risk population should be promoted to balance epidemic control and its impacts on daily lives and the economy.","Zhou, Xinyu; Song, Yi; Jiang, Hao; Wang, Qian; Qu, Zhiqiang; Zhou, Xiaoyu; Jit, Mark; Hou, Zhiyuan; Lin, Leesa",J. med. internet res,4,16

Within less than a year after the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, vaccines developed by several research teams were emergency-use authorized and made their way to distribution sites across the US and other countries. COVID-19 vaccines were tested in clinical trials with thousands of participants before authorization, and were administered to over a billion people across the globe in the following 6 months. Post-authorization safety monitoring was performed using pre-existing systems (such as the World Health Organizations platform VigiBase or US Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, VAERS) and newly developed post-vaccination health checkers (such as V-safe in the US). Vaccinated individuals were also posting their experiences on multiple social media groups created on Facebook, Reddit, Telegram and other platforms, but the groups were often removed as ""proliferating false claims"". These forms of reporting are susceptible to biases and misclassifications and do not reach all vaccinated individuals, raising questions about risks of exacerbating health inequalities as well as security and privacy vulnerabilities. The objective of this paper is to present the protocol for a community-based participatory research approach enabling long-term monitoring of health effects, strengthening community participation via transparent messaging and support, and addressing challenges of transitioning to a new normal.","Gabashvili, Irene S",,4,16

Concerning the ethics of this technology, recent studies have predominantly focused on (1) the formation of guidelines for ethical contact tracing, (2) the analysis of specific implementations, or (3) the review of a select number of contact tracing applications and their relevant privacy or ethical implications. In this study, we provide a comprehensive survey of the evolving ecosystem of COVID-19 tracing applications, examining 152 contact tracing applications and assessing the extent to which they comply with existing guidelines for ethical contact tracing. The assessed criteria cover areas including data collection and storage, transparency and consent, and whether the implementation is open source. We find that although many apps released early in the pandemic fell short of best practices, apps released more recently, following the publication of the Apple/Google exposure notification protocol, have tended to be more closely aligned with ethical contact tracing principles.

Hypertension is one of the risk factors associated with increased mortality and morbidity with Covid-19 infection. Few studies have looked into the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the mental health of healthcare professionals (HCPs). However not much is known about its impact on physical health and blood pressure of HCPs.Objective is to to Study the distribution of blood pressure and impact of Covid 19 on blood pressure of HCPs. Design and method: Prospective cross-sectional survey Methods: The study was conducted among Indian HCPs. A self administered survey asked about the socio demographic data, known risk factors, past history of hypertension, working conditions in lockdown (work from home or working at a healthcare establishment with potential to exposure to Covid-19), work hours and blood pressure measurement for three consecutive days during lockdown. Results: Six Hundred and eighty seven HCPs (52.8% doctors, 25.1% nurses & paramedics, 22.1 allied HCPs), 63.78% males and 36.22% females, mean age 34.8% (SD=11.5 years) participated in the study. 14.4% (98) had known hypertension while 28.8% (198) were found to be hypertensive for the first time (50% Doctors, 26.26% Nurses/Paramedics and 23.74% Allied Healthcare Professionals). 79.3% (n=198) of these had normal blood pressure when checked in the past 12 months. 76.26% (n=198) of these were directly at risk of exposure to Covid-19. The pandemic has seriously impacted the mental and psychological health of HCPs. Our study highlights that Covid 19 pandemic significantly impacts the blood pressure of HCPs with an alarming rise in risk for their health. Conclusions: Health care professionals developed hypertension in significantly higher numbers during COVID-19 pandemic. While working on the frontline with COVID-19, they are already on higher risk of getting infection. COVID-19 has been found to have serious complications with hypertension. Apart from this hypertension itself is known to lead adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Unfortunately, the majority of them are not aware of their elevated blood pressure. HCPs should remain more careful for their own blood pressure while working in pressure of COVID 19.","Gupta, A.; Maheshwari, A.; Verma, N.; Jagadeesha, A.; Dariya, S.

It also models issues of internal political discussion on regional contagion and the effect of protests and unexpected crowd events. I use pool, fixed, and random effects panel data modeling and results show that lockdown in Argentina has been effective in reducing mobility but not in a way that reduces the rate of contagion.

To assess the response, toxicity, and survival outcomes of EPx4, we analyzed our experience. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Response and survival outcomes, selected toxicities, and adherence to chemotherapy dose and schedule were assessed in patients with good-risk GCT who received EPx4 at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center between 1982 and 2016. The results were compared with our past results and published data. RESULTS: Between 1982 and 2016, 944 patients with GCT were treated with EPx4, 289 who were previously reported plus 655 treated between January 2000 and August 2016. A favorable response was achieved in 928 of 944 patients (98.3%). Five-year progression-free, disease-specific, and overall survival rates were 93.9%, 98.6%, and 97.9%, respectively. Median follow-up was 7.3 years (range, 2.8 months to 35.5 years). Viable, nonteratomatous malignant GCT was present in 3.5% of 432 postchemotherapy retroperitoneal lymph node dissection specimens from patients with nonseminomatous GCT. Febrile neutropenia and thromboembolic events occurred in 16.0% and 8.9%, respectively, with one treatment-related death. In the more recent 655-patient cohort, full-dose EPx4 was administered to 631 (96.3%), with deviations from planned treatment driven mainly by vascular (n = 13), hematologic (n = 11), renal (n = 7), or infectious (n = 5) events. CONCLUSION: EPx4 is highly effective and well tolerated in patients with good-risk GCTs and remains a standard of care. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Four cycles of etoposide and cisplatin (EPx4) is a standard-of-care regimen for all patients with good-risk germ cell tumors with a favorable response rate and disease-specific survival of 98%. Full-dose administration of etoposide and cisplatin and complete resection of residual disease lead to optimal outcomes. EPx4 should be the recommended regimen in active smokers, patients with reduced or borderline kidney function, and patients aged 50 years or older, which are patient groups at increased risk for bleomycin pulmonary toxicity. Because of a risk of acquired severe pulmonary illness, EPx4 may also be favored for patients who vape or use e-cigarettes and during ongoing transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.","Funt, Samuel A; McHugh, Deaglan J; Tsai, Stephanie; Knezevic, Andrea; O039,; Donnell, Devon; Patil, Sujata; Silber, Deborah; Bromberg, Maria; Carousso, Maryann; Reuter, Victor E; Carver, Brett S; Sheinfeld, Joel; Motzer, Robert J; Bajorin, Dean F; Bosl, George J; Feldman, Darren R",Oncologist,4,23

We created the Web-based application, PalliCOVID (https://pallicovid.app/), in April 2020 to provide all clinicians with convenient access to palliative care resources and support. PalliCOVID features evidence-based clinical guidelines, educational content, and institutional protocols related to palliative care for COVID-19 patients. It is a publicly available resource accessible from any mobile device or desktop computer that provides clinicians with access to palliative care guidance across a variety of care settings, including the emergency department, hospital ward, intensive care unit, and primary care practice. OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this study was to evaluate usage patterns of PalliCOVID to understand user behavior in relation to this palliative care content platform during the period of the local peak of COVID-19 infection in Massachusetts. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed deidentified usage data collected by Google Analytics from the first day of PalliCOVID's launch on April 7, 2020, until May 1, 2020, the time period that encompassed the local peak of the COVID-19 surge in Massachusetts. User access data were collected and summarized by using Google Analytics software that had been integrated into the PalliCOVID Web application. RESULTS: A total of 2042 users accessed PalliCOVID and viewed 4637 pages from April 7 to May 1, 2020. Users spent an average of 2 minutes and 6 seconds per session. Eighty-one percent of users were first-time visitors, while the remaining 19% were return visitors. Most users accessed PalliCOVID from the United States (87%), with a large proportion of users coming from Boston and the surrounding cities (32% of overall users). CONCLUSIONS: PalliCOVID is one example of a scalable digital health solution that can bring palliative care resources to frontline clinicians. Analysis of PalliCOVID usage patterns has the potential to inform the improvement of the platform to better meet the needs of its user base and guide future dissemination strategies. The quantitative data presented here, although informative about user behavior, should be supplemented with future qualitative research to further define the impact of this tool and extend our ability to deliver clinical care that is compassionate, rational, and well-aligned with patients' values and goals.","Lai, Lucinda; Sato, Rintaro; He, Shuhan; Ouchi, Kei; Leiter, Richard; deLima Thomas, Jane; Lawton, Andrew; Landman, Adam B; Mark Zhang, Haipeng",J Pain Symptom Manage,4,16

However, little is known about pediatricians' experiences with and attitudes toward telehealth. METHODS: Data from a nationally representative survey of American Academy of Pediatrics postresidency US member pediatricians in 2016, restricted to respondents providing direct patient care (n = 744; response rate = 48.7%). Survey collected information on experience with telehealth in the previous 12 months, perceived barriers to telehealth incorporation, and conditions under which nonusers would consider using telehealth. In addition to descriptive statistics, we used multivariable logistic regression to examine characteristics associated with any telehealth experience in the past 12 months. RESULTS: Fifteen percent of pediatricians reported any telehealth use in the 12 months prior to the survey. The most commonly reported barriers to telehealth adoption were insufficient payment and billing issues. Multivariable regression models indicated that pediatricians in rural areas, the West, and subspecialists were most likely to report telehealth use, and identifying barriers was negatively associated with telehealth use. Among nonusers, over half indicated they would consider adopting telehealth if they were paid for the visits. CONCLUSION: Telehealth is considered an important health care delivery mechanism, but only 15% of pediatricians in 2016 reported having used telehealth. Reducing barriers will be instrumental in promoting future telehealth adoption. Many barriers have been reduced during the response to COVID-19, and the impact of these policy changes will need further study.","Sisk, Blake; Alexander, Joshua; Bodnar, Chelsea; Curfman, Alison; Garber, Kelli; McSwain, S David; Perrin, James M",,4,22

Most (20,411) cases are from the state of Victoria. In response to rising infections and community transmission in July 2020, on August 2nd, several restrictions were imposed for the following 111 days, including an 8pm curfew, a travel restriction to 5 km from home, and closure of nonessential services. It is unknown how this affected people living with HIV (PLHIV), who already experience disproportionate levels of mental health issues, comorbidity, and stigma. An online survey was designed with HIV community-based organizations to investigate the impact of the pandemic on Victorian PLHIV. Participants were recruited voluntarily both through social media and Infectious Diseases clinics at participating hospitals. There were 153 respondents. Most were male (77%), aged between 30 and 60 years (77%), and Australian-born (63%). Forty-three percent, 31%, and 25% reported negative impacts upon personal relationships, employment, and income, respectively. HIV care continued with 95% and 98% being able to access their HIV provider and antiretroviral therapy (ART), respectively. Telehealth was used by 92% and was largely well received.

Early thyroidectomy and the efficacy of novel tyrosine kinase inhibitors modified the natural history of MTC, with possibilities of cure or long-term control. The second main compound, pheochromocytoma, is reported with a variable penetrance, from 10 to 80% cases, depending on the mutation of RET. Pheochromocytoma constitutes the main disease to screen in patients with RET mutations. Pheochromocytoma clinical and biochemical diagnosis, as well as the way to treat it are thus crucial. This review will thus focus on the epidemiological specificities of MEN2-related pheochromocytoma, the genotype/phenotype relationship, the modern imaging modalities necessary to confirm the diagnosis in this hereditary context, as well as the optimal management and the possibilities of adrenal sparing surgery. Additional information will include the natural history of MEN2B-pheochromocytoma, the rare cases of malignant pheochromocytoma, and the factors that could modify the penetrance between individuals carrying the same mutation, especially in the same family.","Vincent, Amodru; David, Taieb; Carole, Guerin; Pauline, Romanet; Nunzia, Paladino; Thierry, Brue; Thomas, Cuny; Anne, Barlier; Frederic, Sebag; Frederic, Castinetti",Endocrine,4,16

METHODS: Psoas muscle and femoral nerve sampled from 35 consecutive autopsies of patients who died following SARS-CoV-2 infection and 10 SARS-CoV-2-negative controls were examined under light microscopy. Clinical and laboratory data were obtained by chart review. RESULTS: In SARS-CoV-2-positive patients, mean age at death was 67.8 years (range 43-96 years) and the duration of symptom onset to death ranged from 1-49 days. Four patients had neuromuscular symptoms. Peak creatine kinase was elevated in 74% (mean 959 U/L, range 29-8413 U/L). Muscle showed type 2 atrophy in 32 patients, necrotizing myopathy in 9, and myositis in 7. Neuritis was seen in 9. Major histocompatibility complex-1 (MHC-1) expression was observed in all cases of necrotizing myopathy and myositis and 8 additional patients. Abnormal expression of myxovirus resistance protein A (MxA) was present on capillaries in muscle in 9 patients and in nerve in 7. SARS-CoV-2 immunohistochemistry was negative in muscle and nerve in all patients. In the 10 controls, muscle showed type 2 atrophy in all patients, necrotic muscle fibers in 1, MHC-1 expression in non-necrotic/non-regenerating fibers in 3, MxA expression on capillaries in 2, and inflammatory cells in none, and nerves showed no inflammatory cells or MxA expression. CONCLUSION: Muscle and nerve tissue demonstrated inflammatory/immune-mediated damage likely related to release of cytokines. There was no evidence of direct SARS-CoV-2 invasion of these tissues. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides class IV evidence that muscle and nerve biopsies document a variety of pathological changes in patients dying with COVID-19.","Suh, Joome; Mukerji, Shibani S; Collens, Sarah I; Padera, Robert F; Pinkus, Geraldine S; Amato, Anthony A; Solomon, Isaac H",Neurology,4,16

Our study aimed to evaluate the knowledge, attitude, and practice of oncologists in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on them. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted using a validated questionnaire disseminated to oncologists by SurveyMonkey. The tool had 42 questions that captured participants' knowledge, attitude, and practice; their experiences; and the pandemic's impact on various aspects of their lives. Participants from Middle East and North African countries, Brazil, and the Philippines completed the electronic survey between April 24 and May 15, 2020. RESULTS: Of the 1,010 physicians who participated in the study, 54.75% were male and 64.95% were medical or clinical oncologists. The level of knowledge regarding the prevention and transmission of the virus was good in 52% of participants. The majority (92%) were worried about contracting the virus either extremely (30%) or mildly (62%), and 84.85% were worried about transmitting the virus to their families. Approximately 76.93% reported they would take the COVID 19 vaccine once available, with oncologists practicing in Brazil having the highest odds ratio of intention to receive the COVID-19 vaccine (odds ratio, 11.8, 95% CI, 5.96 to 23.38, P < .001). Participants reported a negative impact of the pandemic on relations with coworkers (15.84%), relations with family (27.84%), their emotional and mental well-being (48.51%), research productivity (34.26%), and financial income (52.28%). CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has adverse effects on various personal and professional aspects of oncologists' lives. Interventions should be implemented to mitigate the negative impact and prepare oncologists to manage future crises with more efficiency and resilience.","Jazieh, Abdul Rahman; Coutinho, Anelisa K; Bensalem, Assia A; Alsharm, Abdullah A; Errihani, Hassan; Mula-Hussain, Layth; Al-Sukhun, Sana; Sampaio-Filho, Carlos A; Khorshid, Ola M R; De Guzman, Roselle B; Alkaiyat, Mohammad O; Jradi, Hoda A",JCO Glob Oncol,4,16

Advantages include saving time, travel and time off work. Disadvantages relate mainly to technological barriers but include increased difficulty in recognising and addressing emotional distress if non-verbal clues are lost. People report that there is more focus on glucose levels and in this sense the consultations are more ‘efficient’. However, emotional issues may be more difficult to identify, particularly if the consultation is phone-based. Diabetes distress and other diabetes-related psychological issues are well recognised but people may be wary about discussing them remotely with a health care professional. To address this, the consultation should focus on the agenda of the person with diabetes, in particular life events or emotional difficulties that may be a barrier to good glucose control. Virtual consultations are certain to become a mainstay of future diabetes care but will not be suitable for everyone. First meetings should be face to face wherever possible to establish rapport; continuity of care is essential to maintain this. Access to technology, safeguarding issues and personal preference all influence suitability for virtual follow up. Training should be offered to diabetes professionals to help them get the most out of a virtual consultation.

In the present work, the dynamics of such spreading was evaluated by the analysis of the growth factor of the disease. Method: It was applied the space phase of the time series, the detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) of the series, and the fractal dimension of the space phase. Results: It was possible to notice a strange attractor in the space phase of the growth factor indicating that the process is a deterministic chaos. The value of the alpha coefficient by DFA showed to be less than 0.5, characteristic of anti-persistent long-range memory, in which large events alternate with small events, and vice-versa. The fractal dimension of the phase space set was a fractal number, between 1 and 2, another indicator that the growth factor of the disease is not random. Conclusion: This global analysis is pointing that the spread of COVID-19 is a deterministic chaos, with long-range memory.

We evaluated the predicted anti-SARS-CoV-2 effect of major royal jelly protein (MRJP)2 and MRJP2 isoform X1, which recently showed high efficacy against other enveloped RNA-viruses (HCV and HIV). Some in-silico analyses have been performed to predict the impact of these proteins on viral entry, replication, and complications. These proteins have shown a high potency in sialic acid hydrolysis from the lung cells (WI-38) surface. Docking analysis showed that these proteins have a high binding affinity to viral receptor-binding sites in the receptor-binding domain, causing attachment prevention. Moreover, MRJPs can exert an inhibitory influence, via different mechanisms, for SARS-CoV-2 non-structural proteins (main and papain proteases, RNA replicase, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and methyltransferase). Also, they can bind to hemoglobin-binding sites on viral-nsps and prevent their hemoglobin attack.

The systemic inflammatory response is a pathogenic mechanism shared by cancer progression and COVID-19. We investigated systemic inflammation as a driver of severity and mortality from COVID-19, evaluating the prognostic role of commonly used inflammatory indices in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients with cancer accrued to the OnCovid study. METHODS: In a multicenter cohort of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients with cancer in Europe, we evaluated dynamic changes in neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio (NLR); platelet:lymphocyte ratio (PLR); Prognostic Nutritional Index (PNI), renamed the OnCovid Inflammatory Score (OIS); modified Glasgow Prognostic Score (mGPS); and Prognostic Index (PI) in relation to oncological and COVID-19 infection features, testing their prognostic potential in independent training (n=529) and validation (n=542) sets. RESULTS: We evaluated 1071 eligible patients, of which 625 (58.3%) were men, and 420 were patients with malignancy in advanced stage (39.2%), most commonly genitourinary (n=216, 20.2%). 844 (78.8%) had &#8805;1 comorbidity and 754 (70.4%) had &#8805;1 COVID-19 complication. NLR, OIS, and mGPS worsened at COVID-19 diagnosis compared with pre-COVID-19 measurement (p<0.01), recovering in survivors to pre-COVID-19 levels. Patients in poorer risk categories for each index except the PLR exhibited higher mortality rates (p<0.001) and shorter median overall survival in the training and validation sets (p<0.01). Multivariable analyses revealed the OIS to be most independently predictive of survival (validation set HR 2.48, 95% CI 1.47 to 4.20, p=0.001; adjusted concordance index score 0.611). CONCLUSIONS: Systemic inflammation is a validated prognostic domain in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients with cancer and can be used as a bedside predictor of adverse outcome. Lymphocytopenia and hypoalbuminemia as computed by the OIS are independently predictive of severe COVID-19, supporting their use for risk stratification. Reversal of the COVID-19-induced proinflammatory state is a putative therapeutic strategy in patients with cancer.","Dettorre, Gino M; Dolly, Saoirse; Loizidou, Angela; Chester, John; Jackson, Amanda; Mukherjee, Uma; Zambelli, Alberto; Aguilar-Company, Juan; Bower, Mark; Sng, Christopher C T; Salazar, Ramon; Bertuzzi, Alexia; Brunet, Joan; Mesia, Ricard; Sita-Lumsden, Ailsa; Seguí, Elia; Biello, Federica; Generali, Daniele; Grisanti, Salvatore; Seeva, Pavetha; Rizzo, Gianpiero; Libertini, Michela; Maconi, Antonio; Moss, Charlotte; Russell, Beth; Harbeck, Nadia; Vincenzi, Bruno; Bertulli, Rossella; Ottaviani, Diego; Liñan, Raquel; Marrari, Andrea; Carmona-García, M Carmen; Chopra, Neha; Tondini, Carlo Alberto; Mirallas, Oriol; Tovazzi, Valeria; Fotia, Vittoria; Cruz, Claudia Andrea; Saoudi-Gonzalez, Nadia; Felip, Eudald; Roqué, Ariadna; Lee, Alvin J X; Newsom-Davis, Tom; García-Illescas, David; Reyes, Roxana; Wong, Yien Ning Sophia; Ferrante, Daniela; Scotti, Lorenza; Marco-Hernández, Javier; Ruiz-Camps, Isabel",J. immunotherap. cancer,4,29

With the help of deep convolutional neural networks (CNN), it is possible to get promising results. In this paper, a new fine-tuned deep CNN model has been proposed to generate precise and accurate diagnostics for binary classification (COVID-19 positive vs COVID-19 negative) using raw chest X-ray images. The detailed model architecture and accuracy metrics are presented which are obtained from fivefold cross-validation trained over 1300 image samples. The proposed model gained a validation accuracy of 99.39394% which is superior as compared to other studies in this domain. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Ghosh, S.; Bandyopadhyay, M.",Studies in Computational Intelligence,4,1

Little is known of their travel health seeking behaviours. China is the biggest source of international students studying in Australia and the unprecedented epidemic of COVID-19 in China makes this an important area of research. METHODS: Focus groups of Chinese international students were conducted to explore travel health-related knowledge, attitudes and practices. Eligible participants were studying in Sydney, and had travelled to China and Hong Kong to visit friends and relatives in the preceding 18 months. A variety of topics were explored, using a focus group guide. Thematic analysis was undertaken on the transcripts using nVivo software. The list of codes and themes were not pre-determined but developed through content analysis. RESULTS: Two focus groups were held with a total of 28 participants. Risk perception about VFR travel was generally low among Chinese international students. Pre-travel healthcare was not sought. Students strongly relied on the Internet, social media, parents and friends in China for travel health advice. CONCLUSION: This research provides insights into Chinese international students as VFR travellers. It confirms students could be a risk population for importations of infections such as COVID-19 because of low risk perception and lack of seeking travel health advice. This can inform health promotion strategies for students.","Ma, Tara; Heywood, Anita; MacIntyre, C Raina",Infect Dis Health,4,3

The extant studies have identified two distinct attitudes of consumers about food label information: one is its usefulness and the second elucidates the avoidance. Hence forth, the current study contributes to the extant literature while signifying both reasons which motivate consumers to read food labels and reasons which discourage consumers from consult food labels at the point of purchase. Moreover, the impact of subjective norms and self-efficacy for healthy packaged food intentions has also been examined for both before the emergence of COVID-19 and during the spread of COVID-19. The underpinning of the proposed model has been justified by the behavioral reasoning theory. The cross-sectional data of 14,455 students has was collected from 10 universities through Microsoft Teams and Zoom. AMOS 21 was employed for the final analysis. The results indicate that before COVID-19 the subjective norms and self-efficacy were not the stimulating factors for the selection of healthy packaged food. On the contrary, during the COVID-19 outbreak, the subjective norms and self-efficacy divulged a significant effect. Moreover, the reasons to consult food labels are positively significant whereas the reasons to avoid food labels have negatively affected the consumer, both before COVID-19 and during COVID-19 outbreak, while endorsing healthy packaged food. Conclusively, COVID-19 has been proved to be a deterrent for unhealthy packaged food lovers while being a blessing for healthy packaged food.","Zafar, Muhammad Zeeshan; Maqbool, Adnan; Cioca, Lucian-Ionel; Shah, Syed Ghulam Meran; Masud, Shahjahan",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),4,29

METHODS: Following the World Health Organization's declaration of a global pandemic, our department policy recommended Q-only SPECT/CT for all patients undergoing nuclear medicine evaluation for suspected PE to reduce the risk of aerosolization of respiratory droplets. We performed a retrospective review of sequential patients admitted with COVID-19 imaged with Q-SPECT/CT between March 17, 2020, and June 30, 2020, at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. We recorded patient demographics, clinical symptoms, Wells score (to stratify patients according to pre-test probability for PE prior to Q-SPECT/CT), and noted ancillary imaging findings on CT. RESULTS: Of the 33 patients imaged with Q-SPECT/CT, 6 patients (3 men, 3 women) had a laboratory confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 (mean age, 55, ± 11.4 years, range 33-68). All patients had a current diagnosis of malignancy and had a moderate or high pre-test probability for PE (mean Wells score 2.8, range 2-4). Q-SPECT/CT was positive in 4/6 (67%) of patients. Distribution of pulmonary emboli was bilateral and segmental in 75% of patients. Ancillary acute findings on SPECT/CT included bilateral parenchymal ground glass opacities (n = 5), pleural effusions (n = 2), and pneumomediastinum (n = 1). CONCLUSION: Q-SPECT/CT has clinical utility for diagnosing PE in patients with COVID-19 where there is a contraindication for iodinated contrast media and a moderate or high pre-test probability for PE.","Das, Jeeban P; Yeh, Randy; Schöder, Heiko",Eur. j. nucl. med. mol. imaging,4,21

METHODS: We conducted a case cohort study of autoimmune disease patients with COVID-19 (confirmed by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 PCR) from February 1, 2020, to July 31, 2020, and compared them in a 1:3 ratio with uninfected patients who were matched based on race, age, sex, and comorbidity index. Patient demographics, clinical course, and outcomes were compared among these patient groups. RESULTS: A total of 70 rheumatic disease patients with COVID-19 (mean age, 56.6 years; 64% African American) were identified. The 34 (49%) patients who were hospitalized used oral glucocorticoids more frequently than those treated as outpatients (p < 0.01). All 10 patients using anti-TNF&#945; medications were treated as outpatients (p < 0.01). Those hospitalized with COVID-19 more often required ICU admission (17 (50%) vs 27 (26%), p = 0.01) and intubation (10 (29%) vs 6 (6%), p < 0.01) than uninfected patients and had higher mortality rates (6 (18%) vs 3 (3%), p < 0.01). Of the six COVID-19 patients who died, only one was of African ancestry (p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: Rheumatic disease patients infected with COVID-19 were more likely to require ICU admission, ventilation, and died more frequently versus uninfected patients with autoimmune disease. Patients on anti-TNF&#945; medications were hospitalized less frequently, while those on chronic glucocorticoids were hospitalized more frequently. These findings have important implications for medication choice in rheumatic disease patients during the ongoing spread of COVID-19. Key Points â¢ We show that hospitalized rheumatic disease patients with COVID-19 have poorer outcomes including ICU admission, ventilation, and death compared to hospitalized rheumatic disease patients not infected with COVID-19. â¢ This study adds further support regarding protective effects of anti-TNF&#945; medications in COVID-19 disease course, with 0 of 10 of these patients required hospitalization.","Arleo, Timothy; Tong, David; Shabto, Julie; O039,; Keefe, Ghazala; Khosroshahi, Arezou",Clin. rheumatol,4,6

The model was used to explore the effects of control measures, such as active tracing, laboratory testing, active treatment, and home quarantine on the epidemic. Considering the condition that R0 = 1.2, when a case of an imported asymptomatic infected individual (AII) was reported in the community, the implementation of control measures reduced the number of AIIs and patients by 62.2% and 62.4%, respectively. The number of undetected AIIs and patients peaked at 302 days of the epidemic, reaching 53 and 20 individuals, respectively. The implementation of sustained active tracing, laboratory testing, active treatment, and home quarantine can significantly reduce the probability of disease outbreaks and block the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic caused by AIIs in the community.","Guo, Zuiyuan; Xiao, Dan",Sci Rep,4,1

The purpose of this study was to track trends in mental health symptoms, use of services, and unmet need for services among U.S. adults and to delineate variation across demographic strata. Data were drawn from the 2020 U.S. Household Pulse Survey from repeated cross-sectional online surveys collected between April 23 and November 23, 2020 from 1,483,378 US adults, weighted to represent the U.S. population. Survey respondents self-reported their symptoms of anxiety and depression, use of medication, counseling services, and unmet need for services. Reports of probable anxiety and depression rose significantly through the study period, to prevalence rates of 50% and 44%, respectively, by November 2020, rates six times higher than early 2019 U.S. norms. Use of prescription medication, counseling services, and unmet need for mental health services also rose significantly. Prevalence rates of probable mental health disorders were highest among young, less educated, single, female, Black and Hispanic respondents, with age and education disparities growing over cohorts. Young, female, and moderately educated respondents also reported higher unmet needs for services. Disparities in estimates of mental health disorders and mental health treatment indicate a striking disequilibrium between the potential need for and the use of mental health services during the COVID-19 pandemic. Rising mental health challenges are being borne largely by young, less advantaged people of color and women, with the potential for expanded interruptions to optimal functioning and societal recovery from COVID-19.","Coley, Rebekah Levine; Baum, Christopher F",Translational behavioral medicine (Internet),4,21

Genotyping is a rapid, high-throughput and low-cost alternative for screening positive SARS-CoV-2 samples in many settings. We have designed a SNP identification pipeline to identify genetic variation using sequenced SARS-CoV-2 samples. Our pipeline identifies a minimal marker panel that can define distinct genotypes. To evaluate the system, we developed a genotyping panel to detect variants-identified from SARS-CoV-2 sequences surveyed between March and May 2020 and tested this on 50 stored qRT-PCR positive SARS-CoV-2 clinical samples that had been collected across the South West of the UK in April 2020. The 50 samples split into 15 distinct genotypes and there was a 61.9% probability that any two randomly chosen samples from our set of 50 would have a distinct genotype. In a high throughput laboratory, qRT-PCR positive samples pooled into 384-well plates could be screened with a marker panel at a cost of < £1.50 per sample. Our results demonstrate the usefulness of a SNP genotyping panel to provide a rapid, cost-effective, and reliable way to monitor SARS-CoV-2 variants circulating in an outbreak. Our analysis pipeline is publicly available and will allow for marker panels to be updated periodically as viral genotypes arise or disappear from circulation.","Harper, Helen; Burridge, Amanda; Winfield, Mark; Finn, Adam; Davidson, Andrew; Matthews, David; Hutchings, Stephanie; Vipond, Barry; Jain, Nisha; Edwards, Keith; Barker, Gary",PLoS One,4,16

The syndrome accompanying predominant right anterior temporal atrophy has previously been described as memory loss, prosopagnosia, getting lost and behavioural changes. Accurate detection is challenging, as the clinical syndrome might be confused with either behavioural variant FTD (bvFTD) or Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, based on neuroimaging features, the syndrome has been considered a right-sided variant of semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (svPPA). Therefore, we aimed to demarcate the clinical and neuropsychological characteristics of rtvFTD versus svPPA, bvFTD and Alzheimer's disease. Moreover, we aimed to compare its neuroimaging profile against svPPA, which is associated with predominant left anterior temporal atrophy. Of 619 subjects with a clinical diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia or primary progressive aphasia, we included 70 subjects with a negative amyloid status in whom predominant right temporal lobar atrophy was identified based on blinded visual assessment of their initial brain MRI scans. Clinical symptoms were assessed retrospectively and compared with age- and sex-matched patients with svPPA (n = 70), bvFTD (n = 70) and Alzheimer's disease (n = 70). Prosopagnosia, episodic memory impairment and behavioural changes such as disinhibition, apathy, compulsiveness and loss of empathy were the most common initial symptoms, whereas during the disease course, patients developed language problems such as word-finding difficulties and anomia. Distinctive symptoms of rtvFTD compared to the other groups included depression, somatic complaints, and motor/mental slowness. Aside from right temporal atrophy, the imaging pattern showed volume loss of the right ventral frontal area and the left temporal lobe, which represented a close mirror image of svPPA. Atrophy of the bilateral temporal poles and the fusiform gyrus were associated with prosopagnosia in rtvFTD. Our results highlight that rtvFTD has a unique clinical presentation. Since current diagnostic criteria do not cover specific symptoms of the rtvFTD, we propose a diagnostic tree to be used to define diagnostic criteria and call for an international validation.","Ulugut Erkoyun, Hulya; Groot, Colin; Heilbron, Ronja; Nelissen, Anne; van Rossum, Jonathan; Jutten, Roos; Koene, Ted; van der Flier, Wiesje M; Wattjes, Mike P; Scheltens, Philip; Ossenkoppele, Rik; Barkhof, Frederik; Pijnenburg, Yolande",Brain,4,20

Considering that new drug development is a time-consuming process, drug repositioning may facilitate rapid drug discovery dealing with sudden infectious diseases. Here, we compared the differences between the virtual structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, and selected a pocket mainly localizing in the fusion cores of S2 domain for drug screening.

After observing variability in testing techniques, we otolaryngologists at a tertiary medical center initiated and evaluated the impact of nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabbing training, including video instruction, to standardize sampling techniques and ensure high-quality specimens. METHODS: Participants in the training were employees (N = 40). Training consisted of an instructional video on how to perform nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs and a live demonstration. Participants completed pre- and posttraining surveys assessing their knowledge and confidence in performing nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs. They then performed swabbing on partners, which was graded per a standardized checklist. RESULTS: Mean scores for knowledge-based questions and confidence in swabbing were significantly higher after the training session (both P < .001). All participants scored ≥6 of 8 on the posttraining checklist. Ninety-five percent rated the video as very or extremely useful. DISCUSSION: Specialized instruction for nasopharyngeal swabbing improved participants’ knowledge—specifically, the appropriate head position and minimum swab time in nasopharynx—and their confidence. After the training, their swabbing execution scores were high. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Video-assisted hands-on instruction for nasopharyngeal swab sampling can be used to standardize teaching. When prompt and accurate testing is paramount, this instruction can optimize procedural technique and should be used early and often. In addition, there may be a professional responsibility of otolaryngologists to participate in such initiatives.","Abud, Brittany T.; Hajnas, Natalia M.; Redleaf, Miriam; Kerolus, Julia L.; Lee, Victoria",OTO Open,4,32

Activation of the viral spike (S)-protein by host cell proteases is essential for viral infectivity. However, the cleavage sites in SARS-S and the protease(s) activating SARS-S are incompletely defined. We found that R667 was dispensable for SARS-S-driven virus–cell fusion and for SARS-S-activation by trypsin and cathepsin L in a virus–virus fusion assay. Mutation T760R, which optimizes the minimal furin consensus motif 758-RXXR-762, and furin overexpression augmented SARS-S activity, but did not result in detectable SARS-S cleavage. Finally, SARS-S-driven cell–cell fusion was independent of cathepsin L, a protease essential for virus–cell fusion. Instead, a so far unknown leupeptin-sensitive host cell protease activated cellular SARS-S for fusion with target cells expressing high levels of ACE2. Thus, different host cell proteases activate SARS-S for virus–cell and cell–cell fusion and SARS-S cleavage at R667 and 758-RXXR-762 can be dispensable for SARS-S activation.","Simmons, Graham; Bertram, Stephanie; Glowacka, Ilona; Steffen, Imke; Chaipan, Chawaree; Agudelo, Juliet; Lu, Kai; Rennekamp, Andrew J.; Hofmann, Heike; Bates, Paul; Pöhlmann, Stefan",Virology,4,24

In the present experiments, we tested various disinfectants in aqueous phase as well as on plastic surface carrying a viral inoculum, through dropping and wiping decontamination techniques, comparatively, so as to evaluate virucidal efficacies of those disinfectants toward an avian coronavirus (infectious bronchitis virus: IBV). We regard this evaluation system applicable to SARS-CoV-2. The disinfectants evaluated were 0.17% food additive glade calcium hydroxide (FdCa(OH)(2)) solution, sodium hypochlorite at 500 or 1,000 ppm of total chlorine (NaClO-500 or NaClO-1,000, respectively), NaClO at 500 ppm of total chlorine in 0.17% FdCa(OH)(2) (Mix-500) and quaternary ammonium compound (QAC) diluted 500-fold in water (QAC-500). In the suspension test, all solutions inactivated IBV inoculum that contained 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) under detectable level within 30 sec. In the carrier test, all solutions, except NaClO-500, could inactivate IBV with 0.5% FBS on a carrier to undetectable level in the wiping-sheets and wiped-carriers. We thus conclude that suspension and carrier tests should be introduced to evaluate disinfectants for the field usage, and that this evaluation system is important and workable for resultful selection of the tested disinfectants against avian coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 on surfaces, particularly on plastic fomite.","MIYAOKA, Yu; KABIR, Md.

The authors encountered three patients with COVID‐19 who presented with erythema and suspected viral rash. In all cases, erythema appeared after the onset of the initial symptoms of COVID‐19. Erythema was considered to be caused by COVID‐19 and not a drug‐induced eruption because, in all cases, erythema was relieved merely by external medicine and oral antihistamines, without discontinuing the original medication. The authors’ hospital accepted 69 COVID‐19 patients between 22 February 2020 and 31 May 2020 and, of these, three (4.3%) exhibited eruptions, and all cases presented erythema. Except for seven patients who exhibited positive nasopharyngeal swab tests for SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA but no symptoms, three (4.8%) of the remaining 62 patients exhibited erythema. Although various types of eruptions have been reported in patients with COVID‐19, erythema was the only type in our patients. Erythema in the three patients exhibited many similarities to that previously reported in COVID‐19 patients, particularly in the manner it appeared and disappeared. For these reasons, these three cases were considered typical examples of erythema in patients with COVID‐19. Considering previous studies and the three cases reported here, there is a high probability that SARS‐CoV‐2 can cause erythema.","Tamai, Masakazu; Maekawa, Aya; Goto, Noriko; Ge, Lindun; Nishida, Tsutomu; Iwahashi, Hiromi; Yokomi, Akinori",J Dermatol,4,1

We summarise the available evidence for in-flight transmission of wild type SARS-CoV-2 during 2020, and for imported COVID-19 clusters to cause outbreaks. This paper provides a data baseline prior to the emergence of new mutations causing SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, whose characteristics may increase the potential risk of in-flight transmission and imported outbreaks. The evidence on in-flight transmission of wild-type SARS-CoV-2 is limited, and is described in a small number of published reports. Most of the available evidence pertains to the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, during a period without non-pharmaceutical interventions such as distancing and in-flight mask wearing. There is considerable potential for outbreaks of COVID-19 from imported cases or clusters when public health guidance around quarantine of travellers and self-isolation of cases is not adhered to. Risks can be mitigated by measures such as: avoiding non-essential travel, targeted testing and quarantine of travellers from high incidence regions or regions of concern, managed quarantine processes, and protocols for rapid investigation and control of transmission from a possible variant of concern. Measures should be dynamically assessed and proportionate to the level of risk.

METHODS: We compared the number of samples received, their distribution, the human resources, and the budget of a Microbiology laboratory in the COVID pandemic (March-December 2020) with the same months of the previous year. RESULTS: the total number of samples processed in the Clinical Microbiology laboratory in March-December 2020 increased 96.70% with respect to 2019 (from 246,060 to 483,993 samples), reflecting an increment of 127.50% when expressed as samples/1000 admissions (from 6,057 to 13,780). The increase in workload was mainly at the expense of the virology (+2,058%) and serology (+86%) areas. Despite additional personnel hiring, the samples processed per technician increased 12.5%. The extra cost attributed to Microbiology amounts to 6,616,511 euros (114.8%).

In patients with suspicion or confirmation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) who require surgical intervention and anesthetic management, strategies must be established to minimize aerosol-generating procedures. Regional anesthesia (RA) is not considered an aerosol-generating procedure per se and is currently proposed such as a safe strategy and part of comprehensive perioperative care. However, the preoperative evaluation has undergone changes in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, so in addition to routine preoperative evaluation, a patient-oriented history, clinical, laboratory, and radiologic evaluation should be performed, and a series of general recommendations should be taken into account before, during, and after the performance of RA procedure. A search of PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases was performed until August 22, 2020, using the words: 〞regional anesthesia or nerve block or peripheral nerve block or spinal anesthesia or epidural anesthesia and SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19 or MERS or SARS-CoV-1 or influenza.〞 We included in this review all articles, regardless of design, published in the English language. Given the benefits reported with the use of RA techniques, both for the patient and for healthcare personnel, it has recently been suggested that RA should be considered as the first choice.

An urgent national enquiry investigating the possible reasons for this phenomenon has been issued in the UK. Inflammation is at the forefront of COVID-19 research as disease severity appears to correlate with pro-inflammatory cytokine dysregulation. This narrative review aims to shed light on the novel, pathophysiological role of inflammation in contributing towards the increased COVID-19 mortality risk amongst the BAME population. METHODS: Searches in PubMed, Medline, Scopus, medRxiv and Google Scholar were performed to identify articles published in English from inception to 18(th) June 2020. These databases were searched using keywords including: ‘COVID-19’ or ‘Black and Minority Ethnic’ or ‘Inflammation’. A narrative review was synthesized using these included articles. RESULTS: We suggest a novel pathophysiological mechanism by which acute inflammation from COVID-19 may augment existing chronic inflammation, in order to potentiate a ‘cytokine storm’ and thus the more severe disease phenotype observed in the BAME population. Obesity, insulin resistance, cardiovascular disease, psychological stress, chronic infections and genetic predispositions are all relevant factors which may be contributing to elevated chronic systemic inflammation amongst the BAME population. CONCLUSION: Overall, this review provides early insights and directions for ongoing research regarding the pathophysiological mechanisms that may explain the severe COVID-19 disease phenotype observed amongst the BAME population. We suggest ‘personalization’ of chronic disease management, which can be used with other interventions, in order to tackle this.","Vepa, Abhinav; Bae, Joseph P.; Ahmed, Faheem; Pareek, Manish; Khunti, Kamlesh",Diabetes Metab Syndr,4,15

METHODS: We conducted an observational study at a Western Connecticut hospital heavily affected by the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic to assess its effects on surgical residents, focusing on surgical education, clinical experience, and operative skills development. Objective data was available through recorded work hours, case logs, and formal didactics. In addition, we created an anonymous survey to assess resident perception of their residency experience during the pandemic. RESULTS: There are 22 surgical residents at our institution; all were included in the study. Resident weekly duty hours decreased by 23.9 hours with the majority of clinical time redirected to caring for COVID-19 patients. Independent studying increased by 1.6 hours (26.2%) while weekly didactics decreased by 2.1 hours (35.6%). The operative volume per resident decreased by 65.7% from 35.0 to 12.0 cases for the period of interest, with a disproportionately high effect on junior residents, who experienced a 76.2% decrease. Unsurprisingly, 70% of residents reported a negative effect of the pandemic on their surgical skills. CONCLUSIONS: During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, surgical residents’ usual workflows changed dramatically, as much of their time was dedicated to the critical care of patients with COVID-19. However, the consequent opportunity cost was to surgery-specific training; there was a significant decrease in operative cases and time spent in surgical didactics, along with elevated concern about overall preparedness for their intended career.","Ostapenko, Alexander; McPeck, Samantha; Liechty, Shawn; Kleiner, Daniel",J Med Educ Curric Dev,4,26

The aim of this study was to analyze the influence factors of death risk among 200 COVID-19 patients. MethodsTwo hundred patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were recruited. Demographic data and clinical characteristics were collected from electronic medical records. Biochemical indexes on admission were measured and patients prognosis was tracked. The association of demographic data, clinical characteristics and biochemical indexes with death risk was analyzed. ResultsOf 200 COVID-19 patients, 163 (81.5%) had at least one of comorbidities, including diabetes, hypertension, hepatic disease, cardiac disease, chronic pulmonary disease and others. Among all patients, critical cases, defined as oxygenation index lower than 200, accounted for 26.2%. Severe cases, oxygenation index from 200 to 300, were 29.7%. Besides, common cases, oxygenation index higher than 300, accounted for 44.1%. At the end of follow-up, 34 (17%) were died on mean 10.9 day after hospitalization. Stratified analysis revealed that older ages, lower oxygenation index and comorbidities elevated death risk of COVID-19 patients. On admission, 85.5% COVID-19 patients were with at least one of extrapulmonary organ injuries. Univariable logistic regression showed that ALT and TBIL, two indexes of hepatic injury, AST, myoglobin and LDH, AST/ALT ratio, several markers of myocardial injury, creatinine, urea nitrogen and uric acid, three indexes of renal injury, were positively associated with death risk of COVID-19 patients. Multivariable logistic regression revealed that AST/ALT ratio, urea nitrogen, TBIL and LDH on admission were positively correlated with death risk of COVID-19 patients. ConclusionOlder age, lower oxygenation index and comorbidities on admission elevate death risk of COVID-19 patients. AST/ALT ratio, urea nitrogen, TBIL and LDH on admission may be potential prognostic indicators. Early hospitalization is of great significance to prevent multiple organ damage and improve the survival of COVID-19 patients. SummaryIn this hospital-based case-cohort study, we found that serum urea nitrogen, TBIL, LDH and AST/ALT ratio, several markers of extrapulmonary organ injuries, were positively correlated with death risk of COVID-19 patients. We provide evidence for the first time that multiple organ damage on admission influences the prognosis of COVID-19 patients.

Changes to behavior during an outbreak limit the reliability of syndromic surveillance using large-scale data sources, such as online social media or search behavior, which could otherwise supplement healthcare-based outbreak-prediction methods. Here, we measure behavior change reflected in mobile-phone call-detail records (CDRs), a source of passively collected real-time behavioral information, using an anonymously linked dataset of cell-phone users and their date of influenza-like illness diagnosis during the 2009 H1N1v pandemic. We demonstrate that mobile-phone use during illness differs measurably from routine behavior: Diagnosed individuals exhibit less movement than normal (1.1 to 1.4 fewer unique tower locations; [Formula: see text]), on average, in the 2 to 4 d around diagnosis and place fewer calls (2.3 to 3.3 fewer calls; [Formula: see text]) while spending longer on the phone (41- to 66-s average increase; [Formula: see text]) than usual on the day following diagnosis.

Structural and biochemical studies have revealed that all confirmed 3CLpro cleavage sites have a conserved Gln residue at the P1 position, which is thought to be absolutely required for efficient cleavage. Recent studies on murine hepatitis virus (MHV) showed that processing of the 1a polyprotein at the position between nsp10–nsp11 is essential for viral replication. In this report, we investigated the requirement of processing at the equivalent position for replication of avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), using an infectious cloning system. The results showed that mutation of the P1 Gln to Pro or deletion of the Gln residue in the nsp10–nsp11/12 site completely abolished the 3CLpro-mediated processing, but allowed production of infectious recombinant viruses with variable degrees of growth defect, suggesting that cleavage at the nsp10–nsp11/12 site of IBV is dispensable for viral replication in cultured cells. This study would pave a way for potential vaccine development by generation of attenuated IBV from field isolates through manipulation of the nsp10–nsp11/12 cleavage site. Similar approaches would be also applicable to other human and animal coronaviruses.","Fang, Shou Guo; Shen, Hongyuan; Wang, Jibin; Tay, Felicia P.L.; Liu, Ding Xiang",Virology,4,1

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed data of patients who underwent EIN or CST surgery for tibia shaft fracture at our center from 2013 to 2018. The patient demographics, fracture characteristics, radiographic information, length of hospital stay, and medical expenses were recorded. All patients were clinically followed-up until they started to walk or for at least 6 months. The treatment outcomes and postoperative complications of the two procedures were compared. RESULTS: Overall, 186 patients who underwent EIN and CST were included in the study. The EIN patients had more low-energy mechanism of injury. In radiographic evaluation, significant differences were observed in distributions of fracture classification and location. Moreover, associated fibula fractures were higher in the EIN group than in the CST group. The CST procedure had faster surgical time, cast duration and lower expenses, and longer hospitalization time. Although they required more clinical visits, patients in the EIN group began exercising and endured weight-bearing earlier than those in the CST group. The average time for bone healing was 68.5 days in the EIN group, and 69.6 days in the CST group. However, the CST provided slight better results of coronal correction than EIN. Moreover, CST patients had less malalignment (> 5 degree) in complications. None had delay union, nonunion, and shortening over 10 mm at final assessment. CONCLUSIONS: Both EIN and CST patients showed similar treatment outcomes. Hence, not only the characteristics of the patient and fracture, but also the individual's situation and expectation should be considered when choosing the best approach.","Zeng, Shuaidan; Deng, Hansheng; Zhu, Tianfeng; Han, Shuai; Xiong, Zhu; Tang, Shengping",Injury,4,20

Unfortunately, despite community efforts leading to the development of SBML and the BioModels database, many published models have not been fully exploited, largely due to a lack of proper documentation or the dependence on proprietary software. To facilitate the reuse and further development of systems biology and systems medicine models, an open-source toolbox that makes the overall process of model construction more consistent, understandable, transparent, and reproducible is desired. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: We provide an update on the development of modelbase, a free, expandable Python package for constructing and analysing ordinary differential equation-based mathematical models of dynamic systems. It provides intuitive and unified methods to construct and solve these systems. Significantly expanded visualisation methods allow for convenient analysis of the structural and dynamic properties of models. After specifying reaction stoichiometries and rate equations modelbase can automatically assemble the associated system of differential equations. A newly provided library of common kinetic rate laws reduces the repetitiveness of the computer programming code. modelbase is also fully compatible with SBML. Previous versions provided functions for the automatic construction of networks for isotope labelling studies. Now, using user-provided label maps, modelbase v1.2.3 streamlines the expansion of classic models to their isotope-specific versions. Finally, the library of previously published models implemented in modelbase is growing continuously. Ranging from photosynthesis to tumour cell growth to viral infection evolution, all these models are now available in a transparent, reusable and unified format through modelbase. CONCLUSION: With this new Python software package, which is written in currently one of the most popular programming languages, the user can develop new models and actively profit from the work of others. modelbase enables reproducing and replicating models in a consistent, tractable and expandable manner. Moreover, the expansion of models to their isotopic label-specific versions enables simulating label propagation, thus providing quantitative information regarding network topology and metabolic fluxes.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the association of audio-only virtual prenatal care with perinatal outcomes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study compared perinatal outcomes of women who delivered between May 1 and October 31, 2019 (n = 6559), and received in-person prenatal visits only with those who delivered between May 1 and October 31, 2020 (n = 6048), when audio-only virtual visits were integrated into prenatal care during the COVID-19 pandemic, as feasible based on pregnancy complications. Parkland Health and Hospital System in Dallas, Texas, provides care to the vulnerable obstetric population of the county via a high-volume prenatal clinic system and public maternity hospital. All deliveries of infants weighing more than 500 g, whether live or stillborn, were included. EXPOSURES: Prenatal care incorporating audio-only prenatal care visits. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was a composite of placental abruption, stillbirth, neonatal intensive care unit admission in a full-term (≥37 weeks) infant, and umbilical cord blood pH less than 7.0. Visit data, maternal characteristics, and other perinatal outcomes were also examined. RESULTS: The mean (SD) age of the 6559 women who delivered in 2019 was 27.8 (6.4) years, and the age of the 6048 women who delivered in 2020 was 27.7 (6.5) years (P = .38). Of women delivering in 2020, 1090 (18.0%) were non-Hispanic Black compared with 1067 (16.3%) in 2019 (P = .04). In the 2020 cohort, 4067 women (67.2%) attended at least 1 and 1216 women (20.1%) attended at least 3 audio-only virtual prenatal visits. Women who delivered in 2020 attended a greater mean (SD) number of prenatal visits compared with women who delivered in 2019 (9.8 [3.4] vs 9.4 [3.8] visits; P < .001). In the 2020 cohort, 173 women (2.9%) experienced the composite outcome, which was not significantly different than the 195 women (3.0%) in 2019 (P = .71). In addition, the rate of the composite outcome did not differ substantially when examined according to the number of audio-only virtual visits attended. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Implementation of audio-only virtual prenatal visits was not associated with changes in perinatal outcomes and increased prenatal visit attendance in a vulnerable population during the COVID-19 pandemic when used in a risk-appropriate model.","Duryea, Elaine L.; Adhikari, Emily H.; Ambia, Anne; Spong, Catherine; McIntire, Donald; Nelson, David B.",JAMA Netw Open,4,5

Yet, the last 50 years is when international attention has been focussed on wetlands through the Ramsar Convention. An analysis of how the convention has evolved over the past 50 years suggests it has been drifting away from its original mandate in a maladaptive manner, and this drift is a problem for achieving its original objectives. A review of the strategic plans of the convention revealed two key conditions for institutional drifting and the associated lack of success. The first condition lies in its unique situation as a non-UN convention, which reduces the convention’s visibility and interactivity with other biodiversity-related conventions, agencies, or programmes. The second condition is an increasing number of conventions dealing with biodiversity issues, all forcing the Ramsar Convention to seek different roles in an increasingly competitive institutional landscape. A more effective future for the convention arguably lies in reasserting its original mandate, but with cognisance of the changed environmental pressures of the twenty-first century. While this would narrow its increasingly broad focus, such a reorientation will allow wetlands and waterfowl to start a track to recovery, backed by active and focused Contracting Parties in a renewed international convention on wetland conservation, management, and sustainable use.","Bridgewater, Peter; Kim, Rakhyun E.",Biodivers Conserv,4,3

All participants provided verbal consent prior to completing the survey. A 37-question web-based survey with no personal identifiers was sent to 212 previously identified AD patients. Itching, sleep disturbances, SARS-CoV-2, illness cost, economic dependence, monthly income, and monthly investment in AD before and during the pandemic, were all included in the analysis. A response rate of 73.1% was obtained. The mean age of participants was 30 years-old, and 57% were women. Around 75% reported AD worsening, and 59.4% of the patients reported sleep problems. Uncertainty, anxiety, and pessimism were frequent during the pandemic. Only 1.3% tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, and it was only significantly associated with comorbidities (p=0.03; Chi(2) Test). A significant difference was found in economic dependence and monthly income when compared between before and during the pandemic.

We report onset, course, correlations with comorbidities, and diagnostic accuracy of nasopharyngeal swab in 539 individuals suspected to carry SARS-COV-2 admitted to the hospital of Crema, Italy. All individuals underwent clinical and laboratory exams, SARS-COV-2 reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction on nasopharyngeal swab, and chest X-ray and/or computed tomography (CT). Data on onset, course, comorbidities, number of drugs including angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin-II-receptor antagonists (sartans), follow-up swab, pharmacological treatments, non-invasive respiratory support, ICU admission, and deaths were recorded. Among 411 SARS-COV-2 patients (66.6% males) median age was 70.5 years (range 1-99). Chest CT was performed in 317 (77.2%) and showed interstitial pneumonia in 304 (96%). Fatality rate was 17.5% (74% males), with 6.6% in 60-69 years old, 21.1% in 70-79 years old, 38.8% in 80-89 years old, and 83.3% above 90 years. No death occurred below 60 years. Non-invasive respiratory support rate was 27.2% and ICU admission 6.8%. Older age, cough and dyspnea at onset, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, renal insufficiency, >7 drugs intake and positive X-ray, low lymphocyte count, high C-reactive protein, aspartate aminotransferase and lactate dehydrogenase values, and low PO2 partial pressure with high lactate at arterial blood gas analysis at admission were significantly associated with death. Use of ACE inhibitors or sartans was not associated with outcomes. Comorbidity network analysis revealed homogenous distribution of deceased and 60-80 aged SARS-COV-2 patients across diseases. Among 128 swab negative patients at admission (63.3% males) median age was 67.7 years (range 1-98). Chest CT was performed in 87 (68%) and showed interstitial pneumonia in 76 (87.3%). Follow-up swab turned positive in 13 of 32 patients. Using chest CT at admission as gold standard on the entire study population of 539 patients, nasopharyngeal swab had 80% sensitivity. SARS-CoV-2 caused high mortality among patients older than 60 years and correlated with pre-existing multiorgan impairment. ACE inhibitors and sartans did not influence patients' outcome.","Benelli, Gianpaolo; Buscarini, Elisabetta; Canetta, Ciro; Piana, Giuseppe La; Merli, Guido; Scartabellati, Alessandro; Vigano, Giovanni; Sfogliarini, Roberto; Melilli, Giovanni; Assandri, Roberto; Cazzato, Daniele; Rossi, Davide Sebastiano; Usai, Susanna; Caldarelli, Guido; Gili, Tommaso; Tramacere, Irene; Pellegata, Germano; Lauria, Giuseppe",,4,24

The disease caused by the coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, reached 216 countries/territories, where about 20 million people were reported with the infection. Of these, more than 740,000 died. In view of the situation, strategies involving the development of new antiviral molecules are extremely important. The present work evaluated, through molecular docking assays, the interactions of 4′-acetamidechalcones with enzymatic and structural targets of SARS-CoV-2 and with the host's ACE2, which is recognized by the virus, facilitating its entry into cells. Therefore, it was observed that, regarding the interactions of chalcones with Main protease (Mpro), the chalcone N-(4′[(2E)-3-(4-flurophenyl)-1-(phenyl)prop-2-en-1-one]) acetamide (PAAPF) has the potential for coupling in the same region as the natural inhibitor FJC through strong hydrogen bonding. The formation of two strong hydrogen bonds between N-(4[(2E)-3-(phenyl)-1-(phenyl)-prop-2-en-1-one]) acetamide (PAAB) and the NSP16-NSP10 heterodimer methyltransferase was also noted. N-(4[(2E)-3-(4-methoxyphenyl)-1-(phenyl)prop-2-en-1-one]) acetamide (PAAPM) and N-(4-[(2E)-3-(4-ethoxyphenyl)-1-(phenyl)prop-2-en-1-one]) acetamide (PAAPE) chalcones showed at least one strong intensity interaction of the SPIKE protein. N-(4[(2E)-3-(4-dimetilaminophenyl)-1-(phenyl)-prop-2-en-1-one]) acetamide (PAAPA) chalcone had a better affinity with ACE2, with strong hydrogen interactions. Together, our results suggest that 4′-acetamidechalcones inhibit the interaction of the virus with host cells through binding to ACE2 or SPIKE protein, probably generating a steric impediment. In addition, chalcones have an affinity for important enzymes in post-translational processes, interfering with viral replication.","Almeida-Neto, Francisco Wagner Q.; Castro Matos, Maria Geysillene; Marinho, Emanuelle M.; Marinho, Márcia M.; de Menezes, Ramon R.P.P.B.; Sampaio, Tiago L.; Bandeira, Paulo N.; Celedonio Fernandes, Carla Freire; Teixeira, Alexandre M.Rodrigues; Marinho, Emmanuel S.; de Lima-Neto, Pedro; S. dos Santos, Hélcio",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,4,11

Numerous investigations have demonstrated that portable air cleaning devices can reduce concentrations of asthma triggers in indoor air; however, their benefits for breathing problems have not always been reproducible. The potential exposure benefits of whole house high efficiency in-duct air cleaners for sensitive subpopulations have yet to be evaluated. METHODS: We used an indoor air quality modeling system (CONTAM) developed by NIST to examine peak and time-integrated concentrations of common asthma triggers present in indoor air over a year as a function of natural ventilation, portable air cleaners, and forced air ventilation equipped with conventional and high efficiency filtration systems. Emission rates for asthma triggers were based on experimental studies published in the scientific literature. RESULTS: Forced air systems with high efficiency filtration were found to provide the best control of asthma triggers: 30–55% lower cat allergen levels, 90–99% lower risk of respiratory infection through the inhalation route of exposure, 90–98% lower environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) levels, and 50–75% lower fungal spore levels than the other ventilation/filtration systems considered. These results indicate that the use of high efficiency in-duct air cleaners provide an effective means of controlling allergen levels not only in a single room, like a portable air cleaner, but the whole house. CONCLUSION: These findings are useful for evaluating potential benefits of high efficiency in-duct filtration systems for controlling exposure to asthma triggers indoors and for the design of trials of environmental interventions intended to evaluate their utility in practice.","Myatt, Theodore A; Minegishi, Taeko; Allen, Joseph G; MacIntosh, David L",Environ Health,4,1

Internationally, researchers have called for studies to understand deterioration risk factors to inform clinical risk tool development. METHODS: Multicentre cohort study of hospitalised patients with COVID-19 (n=3671) exploring determinants of health, including Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) subdomains, as risk factors for presentation, deterioration and mortality by ethnicity. Receiver operator characteristics were plotted for CURB65 and ISARIC4C by ethnicity and area under the curve (AUC) calculated. RESULTS: Ethnic minorities were hospitalised with higher Charlson Comorbidity Scores than age, sex and deprivation matched controls and from the most deprived quintile of at least one IMD subdomain: indoor living environment (LE), outdoor LE, adult skills, wider barriers to housing and services. Admission from the most deprived quintile of these deprivation forms was associated with multilobar pneumonia on presentation and ICU admission. AUC did not exceed 0.7 for CURB65 or ISARIC4C among any ethnicity except ISARIC4C among Indian patients (0.83, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.93). Ethnic minorities presenting with pneumonia and low CURB65 (0–1) had higher mortality than White patients (22.6% vs 9.4%; p<0.001); Africans were at highest risk (38.5%; p=0.006), followed by Caribbean (26.7%; p=0.008), Indian (23.1%; p=0.007) and Pakistani (21.2%; p=0.004). CONCLUSIONS: Ethnic minorities exhibit higher multimorbidity despite younger age structures and disproportionate exposure to unscored risk factors including obesity and deprivation. Household overcrowding, air pollution, housing quality and adult skills deprivation are associated with multilobar pneumonia on presentation and ICU admission which are mortality risk factors. Risk tools need to reflect risks predominantly affecting ethnic minorities.","Soltan, Marina A; Varney, Justin; Sutton, Benjamin; Melville, Colin R; Lugg, Sebastian T; Parekh, Dhruv; Carroll, Will; Dosanjh, Davinder P; Thickett, David R",BMJ Open Respir Res,4,22

Types of conventional and non conventional (H−H, dihydrogen, H‐ π, CH‐ π, anti‐ , proton coordination and H−S) H‐bonding interactions are discussed as well as features emerging from their interplay, such as cooperativity (σ‐ and π‐) effects and allostery. Its utility in many applications is described. Catalysis, proton and electron transfer processes in various materials or supramolecular architectures of preorganized hosts for guest binding, are front‐line technology. The H‐bond–related concept of proton transfer (PT) addresses energy issues or deciphering the mechanism of many natural and synthetic processes. PT is also of paramount importance in the functions of cells and is assisted by large complex proteins embedded in membranes. Both intermolecular and intramolecular PT in H‐bonded systems has received attention, theoretically and experimentally, using prototype molecules. It is found in rearrangement reactions, protein functions, and enzyme reactions or across proton channels and pumps. Investigations on the competition between intra‐ and intermolecular H bonding are discussed. Of particular interest is the H‐bond furcation, a common phenomenon in protein‐ligand binding.

The objective of this study was to examine the psychological pathway through which public trust in the government is associated with mental and physical well-being. We collected cross-sectional data from 501 participants aged ≥18 years using an online panel. Public trust in the government was assessed as our exposure variable. We screened for psychological distress by combining the Patient Health Questionnaire and the General Anxiety Disorder scale. Physical well-being was examined using self-rated health. We further assessed the roles of risk perceptions. The author conducted a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), Pearson’s correlations, multivariable regressions, and mediation analyses (using the Preachers and Hayes’ approach). Participants were 55.29% female, 67.86% Caucasian/white with a mean age of 32.44 ± 11.94 years. Public trust in the government regarding COVID-19 was negatively correlated with psychological distress (r = −0.20; p < 0.001) and positively associated with physical well-being (r = 0.13; p < 0.001). After adjusting for sociodemographic and socioeconomic factors, public trust remained negatively associated with psychological distress (β = −0.19; 95% confidence intervals, [CI] −0.30, −0.09) and positively associated with physical well-being (β = 0.26; 95% CI [0.16, −0.37]). Perceived self-efficacy to practice COVID-19 protective behavior partially mediated the relationship between public trust and psychological distress (13.07%); and physical well-being (28.02%). Perceived self-efficacy to protect self against COVID-19 infection can serve as a psychological pathway through which public trust may be associated with mental and physical health.","Olagoke, Ayokunle A.; Olagoke, Olakanmi O.; Hughes, Ashley M.",Front Psychol,4,1

This study evaluated the efficacy of chest CT to predict disease progression, pulmonary complications, and viral positivity duration. METHODS: A single-center cohort study was conducted by consecutively including hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19. The chest CT patterns were described and a total severity score was calculated. The predictive accuracy of the severity score was evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic analysis, while a Cox proportional hazards regression model was implemented to identify the radiological features that are linked to prolonged duration of viral positivity. RESULTS: Overall, 42 patients were included with 10 of them requiring intensive care unit admission. The most common lesions were ground glass opacities (92.9%), consolidation (66.7%), and crazy-paving patterns (61.9%). The total severity score significantly correlated with inflammatory and respiratory distress markers, as well as with admission CURB-65 and PSI/PORT scores. It was estimated to predict critical illness with a sensitivity and specificity of 75% and 70%, respectively. Time-to-event analysis indicated that patients without ground-glass opacities presented significantly shorter median viral positivity (16 vs. 27 days). CONCLUSIONS: Chest CT severity score positively correlates with markers of COVID-19 severity and presents promising efficacy in predicting critical illness. It is suggested that ground-glass opacities are linked to prolonged viral positivity.

Although many commercial diagnostic kits are available, detailed scientific evaluation is lacking, making the public vulnerable to fear of false-positive results. Moreover, current tissue sampling method from respiratory tract requires personal contact of medical staff with a potential asymptomatic SARSCOV-2 carrier and calls for safe and less invasive sampling method. Here, we have developed a convenient detection protocol for SARS-COV-2 based on a non-invasive saliva self-sampling method by extending our previous studies on development of a laboratory-safe and low-cost detection protocol based on qRT-PCR. We tested and compared various self-sampling methods of self-pharyngeal swab and self-saliva sampling from non-carrier volunteers. We found that the self-saliva sampling procedure gave expected negative results from all of the non-carrier volunteers within 2 hours, indicating cost-effectiveness, speed and reliability of the saliva-based method. For an automated assessment of the sampling quality and degree of positivity for COVID-19, we developed scalable formulae based on a logistic classification model using both cycle threshold and melting temperature from the qRT-PCR results. Our newly developed protocol will allow easy sampling and spatial-separation between patient and experimenter for guaranteed safety. Furthermore, our newly established risk assessment formula can be applied to a large-scale diagnosis in health institutions and agencies around the world.","Won, Joungha; Kazan, Hasan Hüseyin; Kwon, Jea; Park, Myungsun; Ergun, Mehmet Ali; Ozcan, Sureyya; Choi, Byung Yoon; Heo, Won Do; Lee, C.

Limited access to specialized care facilities and expanding patient populations, combined with unprecedented mobility restrictions imposed by the coronavirus disease pandemic, are currently stressing the need for remote solutions in this field. Studies in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) have been heterogeneous in objectives and methodology but generally support the concept that TM interventions produce clinical benefits, cost-effectiveness, and user satisfaction. Nonetheless, data on live interaction between patients and health care providers for MS teleconsultation purposes remain scarce. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to demonstrate the feasibility of planned real time audiovisual teleconsultation over the internet for patients with MS. METHODS: A total of 20 patients with MS presenting at a specialized MS center in Belgium were recruited for this study. One teleconsultation was scheduled for each participant. Patients were provided a unique hyperlink by mail in advance, leading them automatically and directly to the virtual waiting room, where they could accept or decline our incoming call. All teleconsultations were performed by a trained medical student with the intention to keep the conversation similar to what is usually discussed during a classic face-to-face MS consultation; no remote physical exams were performed. The approach was considered feasible if at least 80% of the planned TM visits could be successfully completed at the foreseen moment. Patient satisfaction (technical quality, convenience, and overall quality of care) was evaluated at the end of each teleconsultation by means of 5-point Likert scales containing the categories very unsatisfied, unsatisfied, neutral, satisfied, and highly satisfied. RESULTS: Out of 20 consultations, 17 were successfully completed (85%). Failures were due to patients not responding (n=2) and technical issues (n=1). Out of the 17 consultations, 17 patients declared themselves satisfied or highly satisfied for technical quality, 15 patients for convenience, and 16 patients for overall quality of care. CONCLUSIONS: Planned real time audiovisual teleconsultation over the internet is feasible and highly appreciated in patients with MS. Incorporation of such services in routine clinical MS practice is expected to improve access to specialized care facilities for affected patients.","D'Haeseleer, Miguel; Eelen, Piet; Sadeghi, Nima; D'Hooghe, Marie B; Van Schependom, Jeroen; Nagels, Guy",J Med Internet Res,4,11

COVID-19 has caused an immense psychological burden on the population, especially among doctors and nurses who are faced with high infection risks and increased workload. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare the mental health of medical professionals with nonmedical professionals in different European countries during the COVID-19 pandemic. We hypothesized that medical professionals, particularly those exposed to COVID-19 at work, would have higher levels of depression, anxiety, and stress. We also aimed to determine their main stressors and most frequently used coping strategies during the crisis. METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted during peak COVID-19 months in 8 European countries. The questionnaire included demographic data and inquired whether the participants were exposed to COVID-19 at work or not. Mental health was assessed via the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales32 (23.53)–21 (DASS-21). A 12-item checklist on preferred coping strategies and another 23-item questionnaire on major stressors were completed by medical professionals. RESULTS: The sample (N=609) consisted of 189 doctors, 165 nurses, and 255 nonmedical professionals. Participants from France and the United Kingdom reported experiencing severe/extremely severe depression, anxiety, and stress more often compared to those from the other countries. Nonmedical professionals had significantly higher scores for depression and anxiety. Among medical professionals, no significant link was reported between direct contact with patients with COVID-19 at work and anxiety, depression, or stress. “Uncertainty about when the epidemic will be under control” caused the most amount of stress for health care professionals while “taking protective measures” was the most frequently used coping strategy among all participants. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 poses a major challenge to the mental health of working professionals as a considerable proportion of our participants showed high values for depression, anxiety, and stress. Even though medical professionals exhibited less mental stress than nonmedical professionals, sufficient help should be offered to all occupational groups with an emphasis on effective coping strategies.","Hummel, Svenja; Oetjen, Neele; Du, Junfeng; Posenato, Elisabetta; Resende de Almeida, Rosa Maria; Losada, Raquel; Ribeiro, Oscar; Frisardi, Vincenza; Hopper, Louise; Rashid, Asarnusch; Nasser, Habib; König, Alexandra; Rudofsky, Gottfried; Weidt, Steffi; Zafar, Ali; Gronewold, Nadine; Mayer, Gwendolyn; Schultz, Jobst-Hendrik",J Med Internet Res,4,20

Chatbots endowed with artificial intelligence have also been deployed to shift part of healthcare provision away from hospitals and to support a number of programmes for self-management of chronic disease in the community. With the closure of schools and adults working from home, digital technologies have also sustained many aspects of both professional and social life at a pace and scale not considered to be practicable before the outbreak.

RPAS have been successfully used for surveillance, search and rescue, delivery, and equipping drones with telemedical capabilities being considered. However, we know of no previous consideration of RPAS-delivered tele-ultrasound capabilities. Of all imaging technologies, ultrasound is the most portable and capable of providing real-time point-of-care information regarding anatomy, physiology, and procedural guidance. Moreover, remotely guided ultrasound including self-performed has been a backbone of medical care on the International Space Station since construction. The TeleMentored Ultrasound Supported Medical Interventions Group of the University of Calgary partnered with the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology to demonstrate RPAS delivery of a smartphone-supported tele-ultrasound system by the SwissDrones SDO50 RPAS. Upon receipt of the sanitized probe, a completely ultrasound-naïve volunteer was guided by a remote expert located 100 km away using online video conferencing (Zoom), to conduct a self-performed lung ultrasound examination. It proved feasible for the volunteer to examine their anterior chest, sides, and lower back bilaterally, correlating with standard recommended examinations in trauma/critical care, including the critical locations of a detailed COVID-19 lung diagnosis/surveillance examination. We contend that drone-delivered telemedicine including a tele-ultrasound capability could be leveraged to enhance point-of-care diagnostic accuracy in catastrophic emergencies, and allow diagnostic capabilities to be delivered to vulnerable populations in remote locations for whom transport is impractical or undesirable, speeding response times, or obviating the risk of disease transmission depending on the circumstances.

METHODS: An online survey developed using a rapid Delphi method. The survey was translated into 17 different languages and disseminated electronically in 27 countries via national diabetes nurse networks. RESULTS: Survey responses from 1829 diabetes nurses were included in the analysis. The responses indicated that 28% (n = 504) and 48% (n = 873) of diabetes nurses felt the COVID‐19 pandemic had impacted ‘a lot’ on the physical and psychological risks of people with diabetes, respectively. The following clinical problems were identified as having increased ‘a lot’: anxiety 82% (n = 1486); diabetes distress 65% (n = 1189); depression 49% (n = 893); acute hyperglycaemia 39% (n = 710) and foot complications 18% (n = 323). Forty‐seven percent (n = 771) of respondents identified that the level of care provided to people with diabetes had declined either extremely or quite severely. Self‐management support, diabetes education and psychological support were rated by diabetes nurse respondents as having declined extremely or quite severely during the COVID‐19 pandemic by 31% (n = 499), 63% (n = 1,027) and 34% (n = 551), respectively. CONCLUSION: The findings show that diabetes nurses across Europe have seen significant increases in both physical and psychological problems in their patient populations during COVID‐19. The data also show that clinical diabetes services have been significantly disrupted. As the COVID‐19 situation continues, we need to adapt care systems with some urgency to minimise the impact of the pandemic on the diabetes population.","Forde, Rita; Arente, Liga; Ausili, Davide; De Backer, Kristin; Due‐Christensen, Mette; Epps, Amanda; Fitzpatrick, Anne; Grixti, Moira; Groen, Sijda; Halkoaho, Arja; Huber, Claudia; Iversen, Marjolein M.; Johansson, Unn‐Britt; Leippert, Claudia; Ozcan, Seyda; Parker, Julie; Paiva, Ana Christina; Sanpetreanu, Adina; Savet, Marie‐Alice; Rosana, Svetic‐Cisic; Szewczyk, Alicja; Valverde, Maite; Vlachou, Eugenia; Forbes, Angus",Diabet Med,4,20

The inter-domain disulfide bond between light chain (Lc) and heavy chain (Hc) in human IgG1 lends structural support for antibody scaffold stability, optimal antigen binding, and normal Fc function. Recently, human IgG1λ has been suggested to exhibit significantly greater susceptibility to reduction of the inter Lc-Hc disulfide bond relative to the same disulfide bond in human IgG1κ. To understand the molecular basis for this observed difference in stability, the sequence and structure of human IgG1λ and human IgG1κ were compared. Based on this Lc comparison, three single mutations were made in the λ Lc proximal to the cysteine residue, which forms a disulfide bond with the Hc. We determined that deletion of S214 (dS) improved resistance of the association between Lc and Hc to thermal stress. In addition, deletion of this terminal serine from the Lc of IgG1λ provided further benefit, including an increase in stability at elevated pH, increased yield from transient transfection, and improved in vitro antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). These observations support the conclusion that the presence of the terminal serine of the λ Lc creates a weaker inter-chain disulfide bond between the Lc and Hc, leading to slightly reduced stability and a potential compromise in IgG1λ function. Our data from a human IgG1λ provide a basis for further investigation of the effects of deleting terminal serine from λLc on the stability and function of other human IgG1λ antibodies.","Shen, Yang; Zeng, Lin; Zhu, Aiping; Blanc, Tim; Patel, Dipa; Pennello, Anthony; Bari, Amtul; Ng, Stanley; Persaud, Kris; Kang, Yun (Kenneth); Balderes, Paul; Surguladze, David; Hindi, Sagit; Zhou, Qinwei; Ludwig, Dale L.; Snavely, Marshall",MAbs,4,13

Coronaviruses are a large family of single-stranded ribonucleic acid (RNA) viruses. The virus has four essential structural proteins which include the spike (S) glycoprotein, matrix (M) protein, nucleocapsid (N) protein and small envelope (E) protein. Different technologies are being used for vaccine development to battle the pandemic. There are messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA)-based vaccines, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) vaccines, inactivated viral vaccines, live attenuated vaccines, protein subunit-based vaccines, viral vector-based vaccines and virus-like particle-based vaccines. Vaccine development has five stages. In the clinical developmental stage, vaccine development can be sped up by combining phase 1 and 2. The vaccines can also be approved more swiftly on an emergent basis and released sooner for usage. The United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) has approved Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Janssen coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines for emergency use. There are other vaccines that have been approved around the world. The mRNA vaccines have been created using a novel technology and they contain a synthetically created RNA sequence of virus fragments encoding the S-protein which is injected. These vaccines have a relatively low cost of production and faster manufacturing time but can have comparatively lower immunogenicity and more than one dose of vaccine may be required. In the case of viral vector-based vaccines, genes encoding the SARS-CoV-2 S protein are isolated and following gene sequencings are introduced into the adenovirus vector. These vaccines have a relatively fast manufacturing time but the efficacy of the vaccine is variable based on the host’s immune response to the viral vector. At the time of this paper, there were 81 vaccines in clinical development stage and 182 vaccines in preclinical development stage. Vaccines are an essential tool in our battle against COVID-19. Some of the COVID-19 vaccines have completed their phase III trials while many other potential vaccines are still in developmental stages. It used to take close to a decade for a vaccine to be developed and undergo rigorous testing until its production and availability to the public, but over the past year, we have seen multiple vaccines in different phases of testing against SARS-CoV-2 virus.","Vasireddy, Deepa; Atluri, Paavani; Malayala, Srikrishna Varun; Vanaparthy, Rachana; Mohan, Gisha",J Clin Med Res,4,1

Adjustments to the crude CFR measure can better explain the pandemic situation by improving the CFR estimation. However, no study has thoroughly investigated COVID-19 adjusted CFR of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) countries. In this study, we estimated both survival interval and underreporting adjusted CFR of COVID-19 for the SAARC countries and observed the CFR changes due to the imposition of fees on COVID-19 tests in Bangladesh. Using the daily records up to 9th October, we implemented a statistical method to remove both the bias in crude CFR, i.e., the delay between disease onset and outcome bias and due to asymptomatic or mild symptomatic cases, reporting rates lower than 50% (95% CI: 10%-50%) bias. According to our findings, Afghanistan had the highest CFR, followed by Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Maldives, and Sri Lanka. Our estimated crude CFR varied from 3.71% to 0.29%, survival interval adjusted CFR varied from 3.77% to 0.3% and further underreporting adjusted CFR varied from 1.1% to 0.08%. We have also found that crude CFR increased from 1.261% to 1.572% after imposing the COVID-19 test fees in Bangladesh. Therefore, the authorities of countries with higher CFR should be looking for strategic counsel from the countries with lower CFR to equip themselves with the necessary knowledge to combat the pandemic. Moreover, caution is needed to report the CFR.","Shah, M. R. T.; Ahammed, T.; Anjum, A.; Chowdhury, A. A.; Suchana, A. J.",,4,2

It induced the formation of syncytia in primary pig kidney cell cultures, caused hemadsorption and hemagglutination using chicken, turkey, rat and mouse erythrocytes. In growth curve experiments, infectious virus was produced intracellularly starting at 6 hours after inoculation and was followed by rapid release of the virus from the infected cells. The virus contains ribonucleic acid, is ether sensitive and has a size between 100 and 220 nm. At 37° C, the infectivity titer decreased about 2 log(10)TCID(50) per 24 hours. The viral population was heterogeneous as indicated by the rate of inactivation by U.V. irradiation and acid pH. Some hemagglutinating activity was left after complete loss of infectivity by ether-, temperature- and U.V. treatment. The VW 572 isolate is antigenically related if not identical to isolates from Canada, U.S.A. and England which were classified as a porcine coronavirus. Oronasal and intracerebral inoculation of the VW572 isolate in colostrum deprived pigs resulted in clinical disease after an incubation period of 6 and 4 days, respectively. Signs were characterized by depression, vomition, loss of appetence with rapid weakness in young pigs and vomition with progressive wasting in older pigs. Virus was isolated from nasal and pharyngeal swabs, nasal mucosa, tonsils, lungs and hind brains but not from rectal swabs or other organs tested.

The verbal autopsy, an established strategy involving an interview with a decedent’s caregiver or witness using a semi-structured questionnaire, may improve accurate counting of COVID-19-related deaths. OBJECTIVE: To develop and pilot-test the Verbal Autopsy Instrument for COVID-19 (VAIC) and a death adjudication protocol using it. METHODS/KEY RESULTS: We used a multi-step process to design the VAIC and a protocol for its use. We developed a preliminary version of a verbal autopsy instrument specifically for COVID. We then pilot-tested this instrument by interviewing respondents about the deaths of 15 adults aged ≥65 during the initial COVID-19 surge in New York City. We modified it after the first 5 interviews. We then reviewed the VAIC and clinical information for the 15 deaths and developed a death adjudication process/algorithm to determine whether the underlying cause of death was definitely (40% of these pilot cases), probably (33%), possibly (13%), or unlikely/definitely not (13%) COVID-19-related.

It has catastrophic impacts on daily lives, public health, and the global economy. The detection of coronavirus (COVID− 19) is now a critical task for medical specialists. Laboratory methods for detecting the virus such as Polymerase Chain Reaction, antigens, and antibodies have pros and cons represented in time required to obtain results, accuracy, cost and suitability of the test to phase of infection. The need for accurate, fast, and cheap auxiliary diagnostic tools has become a necessity as there are no accurate automated toolkits available. Other medical investigations such as chest X−ray and Computerized Tomography scans are imaging techniques that play an important role in the diagnosis of COVID− 19 virus. Application of advanced artificial intelligence techniques for processing radiological imaging can be helpful for the accurate detection of this virus. However, Due to the small dataset available for COVID− 19, transfer learning from pre−trained convolution neural networks, CNNs can be used as a promising solution for diagnosis of coronavirus. Transfer learning becomes an effective mechanism by transferring knowledge from generic object recognition tasks to domain-specific tasks. Hence, the main contribution of this paper is to exploit the pre−trained deep learning CNN architectures as a cornerstone to enhance and build up an automated tool for detection and diagnosis of COVID− 19 in chest X−Ray and Computerized Tomography images. The main idea is to make use of their convolutional neural network structure and its learned weights on large datasets such as ImageNet. Moreover, a modification to ResNet50 is proposed to classify the patients as COVID infected or not. This modification includes adding three new layers, named, (′)Conv(′), (′)Batch_Normaliz(′) and (′)Activation_Relu(′) layers. These layers are injected in the ResNet50 architecture for accurate discrimination and robust feature extraction. Extensive experiments are carried out to assess the performance of the proposed model on COVID− 19 chest X−Ray and Computerized Tomography scan images. Experimental results approve that the proposed modification, injected layers, increases the diagnosis accuracy to 97.7% for Computerized Tomography dataset and 97.1% for X−Ray dataset which is superior compared to other approaches.","Elpeltagy, Marwa; Sallam, Hany",Multimed Tools Appl,4,1

To date, no effective treatments exist and current prophylactic therapy access is limited and is only ∼50% effective. To attenuate the risk of RSV infection, we hypothesized that bioengineering of either the virus particle or host cell via the covalent grafting of methoxypoly(ethylene glycol) [mPEG] would prevent infection. To this end, the anti-viral effects of grafting concentration, linker chemistry and polymer length on RSV infection was assessed. For viral modification, short chain polymers (2 kDa) were significantly more effective than long chain (20 kDa) polymers. In contrast, modification of host cells with small polymers provided no (∼0%) protection while long chain polymers effectively prevented infection. For example, at 48 hours post-infection at a multiplicity of infection of 0.5 and grafting concentrations of 5, 7.5, and 15 mm, 20 kDa mPEG decreased infection by 45, 83, and 91%, respectively. Importantly, both viral and host cell PEGylation strategies were able to provide near complete protection against RSV infection of both non-polarized and polarized cells. In conclusion, mPEG-modification of either RSV or the host cell is a highly effective prophylactic strategy for preventing viral infection.","Sutton, Troy C.; Scott, Mark D.",Biomaterials,4,21

Such measures are highly effective when there is high population-wide adherence, which requires information on current risks posed by the pandemic alongside a clear exposition of the rules and guidelines in place. OBJECTIVE: Here we analyzed online news media coverage of COVID-19. We quantified the total volume of COVID-19 articles, their sentiment polarization, and leading subtopics to act as a reference to inform future communication strategies. METHODS: We collected 26 million news articles from the front pages of 172 major online news sources in 11 countries (available online at SciRide). Using topic detection, we identified COVID-19–related content to quantify the proportion of total coverage the pandemic received in 2020. The sentiment analysis tool Vader was employed to stratify the emotional polarity of COVID-19 reporting. Further topic detection and sentiment analysis was performed on COVID-19 coverage to reveal the leading themes in pandemic reporting and their respective emotional polarizations. RESULTS: We found that COVID-19 coverage accounted for approximately 25.3% of all front-page online news articles between January and October 2020. Sentiment analysis of English-language sources revealed that overall COVID-19 coverage was not exclusively negatively polarized, suggesting wide heterogeneous reporting of the pandemic. Within this heterogenous coverage, 16% of COVID-19 news articles (or 4% of all English-language articles) can be classified as highly negatively polarized, citing issues such as death, fear, or crisis. CONCLUSIONS: The goal of COVID-19 public health communication is to increase understanding of distancing rules and to maximize the impact of governmental policy. The extent to which the quantity and quality of information from different communication channels (eg, social media, government pages, and news) influence public understanding of public health measures remains to be established. Here we conclude that a quarter of all reporting in 2020 covered COVID-19, which is indicative of information overload. In this capacity, our data and analysis form a quantitative basis for informing health communication strategies along traditional news media channels to minimize the risks of COVID-19 while vaccination is rolled out.","Krawczyk, Konrad; Chelkowski, Tadeusz; Laydon, Daniel J; Mishra, Swapnil; Xifara, Denise; Flaxman, Seth; Flaxman, Seth; Mellan, Thomas; Schwämmle, Veit; Röttger, Richard; Hadsund, Johannes T; Bhatt, Samir",J Med Internet Res,4,1

This study aimed to identify the relationship between the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) constructs and nursing staffs’ practice to use PR in long-term care (LTC) facilities. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted via convenience sampling among 316 nursing staff in six Chinese LTC facilities. PR-TPB questionnaire and the practice subscale of the Chinese version of the Staff Knowledge, Attitudes and Practices Questionnaire regarding PR were used to collect the data. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to examine the relationship between variables. RESULTS: The SEM fit well with the data (χ(2)/df =1.639, RMSEA = 0.045, CFI= 0.955, GFI=0.945). Attitude (β=0.536, P<0.001) and perceived behavioral control (PBC) (β=0.139, P<0.05) predicted intention (R(2)=0.359). PBC was a significant predictor of practice, with R(2) accounting for 0.151. CONCLUSION: TPB provided useful insight into better understanding nursing staffs’ PR practices, although it did not support all the TPB principles significantly. Prospective studies may be conducted to design and implement multi-component interventions based on TPB and explore the effectiveness of PR reduction in LTC facilities in-depth.","Wang, Jun; Liu, Weichu; Zhao, Qinghua; Xiao, Mingzhao; Peng, Daomei",Psychol Res Behav Manag,4,1

We prospectively screened at-risk individuals for SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid protein antibodies in a POC setting to determine if it was a feasible method to identify antibody from prior infection. METHODS: Three EUA-approved lateral flow antibody assays were performed on POC finger-stick blood and compared with serum and a CLIA nucleocapsid antibody immunoassay. Variables including antibody class, time since PCR, and the assay antigen used were evaluated. RESULTS: 512 subjects enrolled, of which 104 had a COVID-19 history and positive PCR. Only three PCR-positive subjects required hospitalization, with one requiring mechanical ventilation. The POC results correlated well with the immunoassay (93–97% sensitivity) and using serum did not improve the sensitivity or specificity. CONCLUSIONS: Finger-stick, POC COVID-19 antibody testing was highly effective in identifying antibody resulting from prior infections in mildly symptomatic subjects. Using high-complexity serum immunoassays did not improve the screening outcome. Almost all individuals with COVID-19 infection produced detectable antibodies to the virus. POC antibody testing is useful as a screen for prior COVID-19 infection, and should be useful in assessing vaccine response.","Schuler, Charles F.; Gherasim, Carmen; O’Shea, Kelly; Manthei, David M.; Chen, Jesse; Giacherio, Don; Troost, Jonathan P.; Baldwin, James L.; Baker, James R.",PLoS One,4,16

For cities such as Mombasa, the problems will be further compounded by high prevalence of informal economies and settlements superimposed on western style governance systems. Yet, right from colonisation to the present day, the water supply and sewage systems have been characterised by a series of inequalities in access. This review paper, discusses the water and sanitation backlogs in the coastal city of Mombasa, tracing them from the colonial times to the post-colonial period. Against this background, we overview the current situation of the water and sanitation sector in the city and discuss possible sustainable interventions. We argue that any analysis of the water and sanitation challenges must consider the motive of the development of the infrastructure during the colonial times. We conclude that sustainable water and sanitation services are likely to remain a mirage unless the issues of funding, cost recovery, data availability and overall governance are fully addressed. A good understanding of both historical inadequacies and current investments would help in designing sustainable interventions going forward.","Kithiia, Justus; Majambo, Gamoyo",Cities,4,16

The present study analyzed maximal and early (within 10 days after disease onset) concentrations of 12-plex cytokines in plasma. We found consistently elevated plasma levels of IL-6, IL-8 and IL-5 in patients who were deceased compared with those who had mild/moderate or severe disease. The early plasma concentrations of IFN-a and IL-2 positively correlated with the length of the disease course. Moreover, correlation network analysis showed that IL-6, IL-8, and IL-5 located at the center of an inter-correlated cytokine network. These findings suggested that IL-8, IL-6, IL-5 might play central roles in cytokine storms associated with COVID-19 and that the early detection of multiple plasma cytokines might help to predict the prognosis of this disease.","Liu, Yili; Chen, Daihong; Hou, Junjie; Li, Haicong; Cao, Dan; Guo, Mingquan; Ling, Yun; Gao, Menglu; Zhou, Yi; Wan, Yanmin; Zhu, Zhaoqin",Cytokine,4,1

Novel approaches to extend treatment capacity include telemedicine (TM) and mobile treatment on demand; however, their combined use has not been reported or evaluated. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the use of a TM mobile treatment unit (TM-MTU) to improve access to MOUD for individuals living in an underserved rural area. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This quality improvement study evaluated data collected from adult outpatients with a diagnosis of OUD enrolled in the TM-MTU initiative from February 2019 (program inception) to June 2020. Program staff traveled to rural areas in a modified recreational vehicle equipped with medical, videoconferencing, and data collection devices. Patients were virtually connected with physicians based more than 70 miles (112 km) away. Data analysis was performed from June to October 2020. INTERVENTION: Patients received buprenorphine prescriptions after initial teleconsultation and follow-up visits from a study physician specialized in addiction psychiatry and medicine. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was 3-month treatment retention, and the secondary outcome was opioid-positive urine screens. Exploratory outcomes included use of other drugs and patients’ travel distance to treatment. RESULTS: A total of 118 patients were enrolled in treatment, of whom 94 were seen for follow-up treatment predominantly (at least 2 of 3 visits [>50%]) on the TM-MTU; only those 94 patients’ data are considered in all analyses. The mean (SD) age of patients was 36.53 (9.78) years, 59 (62.77%) were men, 71 (75.53%) identified as White, and 90 (95.74%) were of non-Hispanic ethnicity. Fifty-five patients (58.51%) were retained in treatment by 3 months (90 days) after baseline. Opioid use was reduced by 32.84% at 3 months, compared with baseline, and was negatively associated with treatment duration (F = 12.69; P = .001). In addition, compared with the nearest brick-and-mortar treatment location, TM-MTU treatment was a mean of 6.52 miles (range, 0.10-58.70 miles) (10.43 km; range, 0.16-93.92 km) and a mean of 10 minutes (range, 1-49 minutes) closer for patients. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These data demonstrate the feasibility of combining TM with mobile treatment, with outcomes (retention and opioid use) similar to those obtained from office-based TM MOUD programs. By implementing a traveling virtual platform, this clinical paradigm not only helps fill the void of rural MOUD practitioners but also facilitates access to underserved populations who are less likely to reach traditional medical settings, with critical relevance in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Weintraub, Eric; Seneviratne, Chamindi; Anane, Jessica; Coble, Kelly; Magidson, Jessica; Kattakuzhy, Sarah; Greenblatt, Aaron; Welsh, Christopher; Pappas, Alexander; Ross, Terri L.; Belcher, Annabelle M.",JAMA Netw Open,4,3

METHODS: In a retrospective analysis of claims data from National Health Insurance and Later‐Stage Elderly Healthcare System enrollees in Kobe City, Japan, we examined the changes in PCI incidence before and during the COVID‐19 outbreak. Percutaneous coronary intervention incidence during the COVID‐19 outbreak in 2020 was compared with that of the same (pre‐outbreak) period in 2019 using a Poisson regression analysis with the monthly number of PCIs as the dependent variable. RESULTS: A total of 639 patients underwent PCI in Kobe City between February and May 2020. The results showed a 19% reduction in all PCI procedures during the outbreak relative to the pre‐outbreak period (P = 0.001). There were no significant changes in non‐elective PCIs for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) cases, but a 25% reduction in elective PCIs for non‐ACS cases (P < 0.001).

Therefore, medical professionals urgently need an early diagnosis method for this new type of disease as soon as possible. In this research work, a new early screening method for the investigation of COVID-19 pneumonia using chest CT scan images has been introduced. For this purpose, a new image segmentation method based on K-means clustering algorithm (KMC) and novel fast forward quantum optimization algorithm (FFQOA) is proposed. The proposed method, called FFQOAK (FFQOA+KMC), initiates by clustering gray level values with the KMC algorithm and generating an optimal segmented image with the FFQOA. The main objective of the proposed FFQOAK is to segment the chest CT scan images so that infected regions can be accurately detected. The proposed method is verified and validated with different chest CT scan images of COVID-19 patients. The segmented images obtained using FFQOAK method are compared with various benchmark image segmentation methods. The proposed method achieves mean squared error, peak signal-to-noise ratio, Jaccard similarity coefficient and correlation coefficient of 712.30, 19.61, 0.90 and 0.91 in case of four experimental sets, namely Experimental_Set_1, Experimental_Set_2, Experimental_Set_3 and Experimental_Set_4, respectively.

Peripheral nerves and the skeletal muscle are less predominantly affected. In the vast majority of the cases, there is no direct attack of the virus towards vulnerable structures, which explains why various manifestations of the nervous system manifest favourably to immune suppression or immune modulation.

We report that all these viruses are potent inducers for the expression of interleukin‐8 (IL‐8) and monocyte chemoattractant protein‐1 (MCP‐1) genes in primary human astrocytes, as well as in an established astrocyte cell line (U‐373MG). Further studies indicated that both activator protein‐1 (AP‐1) and NF‐κB transcription factors are required in the activation of chemokine genes in human astrocytes infected with various picornaviruses. Interestingly, the pattern of activated chemokine genes in human astrocytes is quite restricted compared to that in mouse astrocytes infected with the same viruses, suggesting species differences in gene activation.

The results and findings elaborated the spatiotemporal distribution and their changes during 2020 within Wuhan, which could provide a beneficial support for assessment of the COVID-19 pandemic and implementation of resumption plans for sustainable development.","Zhou, Ya'nan; Feng, Li; Zhang, Xin; Wang, Yan; Wang, Shunying; Wu, Tianjun",Sustain Cities Soc,4,22

Mitigating virus spread could benefit from reliable predictive models that inform effective social and healthcare strategies. Crucially, the predictive validity of these models depends upon incorporating behavioral and social responses to infection that underwrite ongoing social and healthcare strategies. Formally, the problem at hand is not unlike the one faced in neuroscience when modelling brain dynamics in terms of the activity of a neural network: the recent COVID19 pandemic develops in epicenters (e.g. cities or regions) and diffuses through transmission channels (e.g., population fluxes). Indeed, the analytic framework known as ""Dynamic Causal Modeling"" (DCM) has recently been applied to the COVID-19 pandemic, shedding new light on the mechanisms and latent factors driving its evolution. The DCM approach rests on a time-series generative model that provides - through Bayesian model inversion and inference - estimates of the factors underlying the progression of the pandemic. We have applied DCM to data from northern Italian regions, which were the first areas in Europe to contend with the COVID-19 outbreak. We used official data on the number of daily confirmed cases, recovered cases, deaths and performed tests. The model - parameterized using data from the first months of the pandemic phase - was able to accurately predict its subsequent evolution (including social mobility, as assessed through GPS monitoring, and seroprevalence, as assessed through serologic testing) and revealed the potential factors underlying regional heterogeneity. Importantly, the model predicts that a second wave could arise due to a loss of effective immunity after about 7 months. This second wave was predicted to be substantially worse if outbreaks are not promptly isolated and contained. In short, dynamic causal modelling appears to be a reliable tool to shape and predict the spread of the COVID-19, and to identify the containment and control strategies that could efficiently counteract its second wave, until effective vaccines become available.","Gandolfi, D.; Pagnoni, G.; Filippini, T.; Goffi, A.; Vinceti, M.; D'Angelo, E.

The questionnaire was to be answered by key respondents representing the three major OH components: (i). Animal Health; (ii). Human Health/Public Health; (iii). Environmental Health. A target respondent rate of nine respondents/country was aimed for, representing the following categories: (i). ministries; (ii). academia-research; (iii). private sector and NGOs, associations and scientific societies. The questionnaire, composed of 27 questions organized in six sections, was circulated to target respondents by Committee Members of the two COST actions. A total of 171 respondents from 34 countries completed the questionnaire, mainly belonging to academic and research institutions (55.5%), and to Animal Health/Animal Science fields (53.8%). Although the majority (57.9%) declared they had heard about OH, few respondents (10.7%) provided a complete definition. The “human” and “animal” elements prevailed over other key elements of OH definition (ecosystem, intersectoral, transdisciplinary, holistic, collaboration). Overall, 62.6% respondents declared to take part in OH initiatives. Antimicrobial resistance, avian influenza and environmental pollution were cited as the top three OH issues over the past 5 years. Limitations and gaps in intersectoral collaboration included communication and organizational problems resulting in poor networking, differing priorities and a lack of understanding between sectors. Regarding control and monitoring of zoonotic diseases, respondents from different sectors preferentially selected their own directorates/ministries while actually in most countries both Ministry of Health and Ministry of Agriculture are engaged. According to respondents, the level of awareness of OH amongst the general public is limited. Similarly, a dearth of opportunities of collaborations at different institutional and/or professional levels was described. Our survey provided an overview of how respondents in COST countries perceived and experienced OH and current limits to OH implementation. Identifying how initiatives are currently working and knowing the promoting and hindering factors allowed suggesting strategies to promote efficiency and effectiveness of OH implementation in the future.","Chiesa, Francesco; Tomassone, Laura; Savic, Sara; Bellato, Alessandro; Mihalca, Andrei Daniel; Modry, David; Häsler, Barbara; De Meneghi, Daniele",Front Public Health,4,26

Mammalian 2-Cys peroxiredoxins have been shown to eliminate efficiently the H(2)O(2) generated in response to receptor stimulation. 2-Cys peroxiredoxins are members of a novel peroxidase family that catalyze the H(2)O(2) reduction reaction in the presence of thioredoxin, thioredoxin reductase and NADPH. Several lines of evidence suggest that 2-Cys peroxiredoxins have dual roles as regulators of the H(2)O(2) signal and as defenders of oxidative stress. In particular, 2-Cys peroxiredoxin appears to provide selective, specific and localized control of receptor-mediated signal transduction. Thus, the therapeutic potential of 2-Cys peroxiredoxins is clear for diseases, such as cancer and cardiovascular diseases, that involve reactive oxygen species.","Kang, Sang Won; Rhee, Sue Goo; Chang, Tong-Shin; Jeong, Woojin; Choi, Min Hee",Trends Mol Med,4,9

It is also known as an immunomodulatory hormone. Experimental studies have shown that 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, the active form of vitamin D, exerts immunologic activities on multiple components of the innate and adaptive immune system as well as endothelial membrane stability. Association between low levels of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D and increased risk of developing several immune-related diseases and disorders, including psoriasis, type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, tuberculosis, sepsis, respiratory infection, and COVID-19, has been observed. Accordingly, a number of clinical trials aiming to determine the efficacy of administration of vitamin D and its metabolites for treatment of these diseases have been conducted with variable outcomes. Interestingly, recent evidence suggests that some individuals might benefit from vitamin D more or less than others as high inter-individual difference in broad gene expression in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells in response to vitamin D supplementation has been observed. Although it is still debatable what level of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D is optimal, it is advisable to increase vitamin D intake and have sensible sunlight exposure to maintain serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D at least 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L), and preferably at 40–60 ng/mL (100–150 nmol/L) to achieve the optimal overall health benefits of vitamin D.","Charoenngam, Nipith; Holick, Michael F.",Nutrients,4,21

Echocardiography remains the preferred modality for diagnosis and monitoring of pregnant women with cardiovascular disease as it is widely available and does not require radiation. This paper reviews the role of echocardiography along the continuum of pregnancy in at-risk patients, with a focus on key cardiac disease states in pregnancy. RECENT FINDINGS: In the preconception stage, risk stratification scores such as CARPREG II, ZAHARA and the modified WHO remain central to counseling and planning. As such, echocardiography serves an important role in assessing the severity of pre-existing structural disease. Among women with pre-existing cardiovascular disease who become pregnant—as well as those who develop cardiovascular symptoms during pregnancy—echocardiography is a key imaging tool for assessment of hemodynamic and structural changes and is recommended as the first-line imaging modality when appropriate by both the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). However, routine screening intervals during pregnancy for various cardiac lesions are not well defined, resulting in clinical heterogeneity in care. SUMMARY: Echocardiography is the imaging modality of choice for defining, risk stratifying, and monitoring cardiovascular changes throughout pregnancy. Once identified, at-risk patients should receive careful individual counseling and follow-up with a multidisciplinary team. Echocardiography serves as a widely available tool for serial monitoring of pregnant women with cardiovascular disease throughout pregnancy and the postpartum period.","Afari, Henrietta A.; Davis, Esther F.; Sarma, Amy A.",Curr Treat Options Cardiovasc Med,4,16

Risk of infection can be minimized by use of proper personal protective equipment (PPE). The aim of this study was to assess the availability and use of PPE, and satisfaction of HCPs with PPE in six public hospitals in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 1134 HCPs in June 2020. A systematic random sampling and consecutive sampling techniques were used to select the study participants. Data were collected using a self-administered questionnaire. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the data and Chi-square test was used to assess the association between the groups. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression models were used to assess factors associated with satisfaction of healthcare workers. RESULTS: The mean (±SD) age of the participants was 30.26 ± 6.43 year and 52.6% were females. Nurses constituted about 40% of the overall sample, followed by physicians (22.2%), interns (10.8%), midwives (10.3%) and others (16.7%). The majority (77%) of the HCPs reported that their hospital did not have adequate PPE. A critical shortage of N95 respirators was particularly reported, it only increased from 13 to 24% before and during COVID-19, respectively. The use of N95 increased from 9 to 21% before and during COVID-19, respectively. Almost 72% of the respondents were dissatisfied with the availability and use of PPE in their hospital. The independent predictors of the respondents’ satisfaction level about PPE were healthcare workers who reported that PPE was adequately available in the hospital (adjusted OR = 7.65, 95% CI:5.09–11.51), and preparedness to provide care to COVID-19 cases (adjusted OR = 2.07, 95% CI:1.42–3.03). CONCLUSIONS: A critical shortage of appropriate PPE and high level of dissatisfaction with the availability and use of PPE were identified. Therefore, urgent efforts are needed to adequately supply the healthcare facilities with appropriate PPE to alleviate the challenges.

Personal protective equipment and negative pressure isolation rooms (NPIRs) have not been completely successful in protecting HCWs. We introduced an innovative, integrated infection control strategy involving triaging patients using barriers, zones of risk, and extensive installation of alcohol dispensers for glove-on hand rubbing. This integrated infection control approach was implemented at a SARS designated hospital (‘study hospital’) where NPIRs were not available. The number of HCWs who contracted SARS in the study hospital was compared with the number of HCWs who contracted SARS in 86 Taiwan hospitals that did not use the integrated infection control strategy. Two HCWs contracted SARS in the study hospital (0.03 cases/bed) compared with 93 HCWs in the other hospitals (0.13 cases/bed) during the same three-week period. Our strategy appeared to be effective in reducing the incidence of HCWs contracting SARS. The advantages included rapid implementation without NPIRs, flexibility to transfer patients, and re-inforcement for HCWs to comply with infection control procedures, especially handwashing.

Using these data, diffusion coefficients of the virion in aqueous media and in air were calculated. The structure and dimensions of the spike protein derived from molecular dynamic modeling and thorough cryo-EM measurements were also analyzed. The charge distribution over the molecule was calculated and shown to be largely heterogeneous. Whereas the stalk part is negatively charged, the top part of the spike molecule, especially the receptor binding domain, remains positively charged for a broad range of pH. It is underlined that such a charge distribution pattern promotes the spike corona stability and enhances the virion attachment to receptors and abiotic surfaces, mostly negatively charged. The review is completed by the analysis of experimental data pertinent to the spike protein adsorption at biotic surfaces comprising nanoparticle carrier particles. It is argued that these theoretical and experimental data can be used for developing quantitative models of virus attachment to receptors and abiotic surfaces facilitating adequate analysis of future experimental results.","Adamczyk, Zbigniew; Batys, Piotr; Barbasz, Jakub",Curr Opin Colloid Interface Sci,4,3

The current vaccines target the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein and thus far have shown tremendous efficacy. However, the need for cold-chain distribution, a prime-boost administration schedule, and the emergence of variants of concern (VOCs) call for diligence in novel SARS-CoV-2 vaccine approaches. We studied 13 peptide epitopes from SARS-CoV-2 and identified three neutralizing epitopes that are highly conserved among the VOCs. Monovalent and trivalent COVID-19 vaccine candidates were formulated by chemical conjugation of the peptide epitopes to cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV) nanoparticles and virus-like particles (VLPs) derived from bacteriophage Qβ. Efficacy of this approach was validated first using soluble vaccine candidates as solo or trivalent mixtures and subcutaneous prime-boost injection. The high thermal stability of our vaccine candidates allowed for formulation into single-dose injectable slow-release polymer implants, manufactured by melt extrusion, as well as microneedle (MN) patches, obtained through casting into micromolds, for prime-boost self-administration. Immunization of mice yielded high titers of antibodies against the target epitope and S protein, and data confirms that antibodies block receptor binding and neutralize SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 against infection of human cells. We present a nanotechnology vaccine platform that is stable outside the cold-chain and can be formulated into delivery devices enabling single administration or self-administration.

First, the presence of polyP granules in the cytoplasm of CRL1505 strain was evidenced by specific staining.

Acute inflammation is an essential element of host defense against infection, but can be damaging to the host when left unchecked. Effective host defense requires multiple lipid mediators, which collectively have proinflammatory and/or proresolving effects on the lung. During pulmonary infections, phospholipid acyl chains and cholesterol can be chemically and enzymatically oxidized, as well as truncated and modified, producing complex mixtures of bioactive lipids. We review recent evidence that phospholipids and cholesterol and their derivatives regulate pulmonary innate and adaptive immunity during infection. We first highlight data that oxidized phospholipids generated in the lung during infection stimulate pattern recognition receptors, such as TLRs and scavenger receptors, thereby amplifying the pulmonary inflammatory response. Next, we discuss evidence that oxidation of endogenous pools of cholesterol during pulmonary infections produces oxysterols that also modify the function of both innate and adaptive immune cells. Last, we conclude with data that n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, both in the form of phospholipid acyl chains and through enzymatic processing into endogenous proresolving lipid mediators, aid in the resolution of lung inflammation through distinct mechanisms. Unraveling the complex mechanisms of induction and function of distinct classes of bioactive lipids, both native and modified, may hold promise for developing new therapeutic strategies for improving pulmonary outcomes in response to infection.","Shaikh, Saame Raza; Fessler, Michael B.; Gowdy, Kymberly M.",Journal of Leukocyte Biology,4,1

METHODS: A quota sample was recruited from participants who participated in our DCE. We specifically targeted participants who were strongly in favour of face-to-face consultations (F2F - defined as choosing all or mostly F2F in the DCE) or strongly in favour of virtual consultations (VC - defined as choosing all or mostly VC consultations in the DCE) to elicit a range of views. Interviews were conducted via telephone or videoconference, audio recorded, transcribed verbatim and uploaded into NVIVO software. A directed content analysis of transcripts was undertaken in accordance with a coding framework based on the results of the DCE and the impact of COVID-19 on preference. RESULTS: Eight F2F and 5 VC participants were included. Shorter appointments were less ‘worth’ travelling in for than a longer appointment and rush hour travel had an effect on whether travelling was acceptable, particularly when patients experienced pain as a result of extended journeys. Socioeconomic factors such as cost of travel, paid time off work, access to equipment and support in its use was important. Physical examinations were preferable in the clinic whereas talking therapies were acceptable over VC. Several participants commented on how VC interferes with the patient-clinician relationship. VC during COVID-19 has provided patients with the opportunity to access their care virtually without the need for travel. For some, this was extremely positive. CONCLUSIONS: This study investigated the results of a previously completed DCE and the impact of COVID-19 on patient preferences for VC. Theoretically informative insights were gained to explain the results of the DCE. The use of VC during the COVID-19 pandemic provided opportunities to access care without the need for face-to-face social interactions. Many felt that VC would become more commonplace after the pandemic, whereas others were keen to return to F2F consultations as much as possible. This qualitative study provides additional context to the results of a previously completed DCE.

Investigating the dynamic behavior of ligand–protein interaction, ligands PF-07321332 and α-ketoamide showed stronger bonding via making interactions with catalytic dyad residues His41–Cys145 of 3CL(pro). Lopinavir and ritonavir were unable to disrupt the catalytic dyad, as illustrated by increased bond length during the MD simulation. To decipher the ligand binding mode and affinity, ligand interactions with SARS-CoV-2 proteases and binding energy were calculated. The binding energy of the bespoke antiviral PF-07321332 clinical candidate was two times higher than that of α-ketoamide and three times than that of lopinavir and ritonavir. Our study elucidated in detail the binding mechanism of the potent PF-07321332 to 3CL(pro) along with the low potency of lopinavir and ritonavir due to weak binding affinity demonstrated by the binding energy data. This study will be helpful for the development and optimization of more specific compounds to combat coronavirus disease.","Ahmad, Bilal; Batool, Maria; Ain, Qurat ul; Kim, Moon Suk; Choi, Sangdun",Int J Mol Sci,4,29

An anonymous self-administered online survey involving polish ophthalmology residents was conducted between February 15 and 28, 2021. Of the 126 residents who completed the survey, 88.9% (n = 112) and 89.7% (n = 113) felt that the COVID-19 pandemic had negatively impacted their surgical training and overall training programs, respectively. Trainees providing care to patients with COVID-19 and female trainees indicated a greater negative impact of the pandemic on the implementation of the specialization program (p = 0.008 and p = 0.015, respectively) and on the acquisition of practical skills (p = 0.014 and p = 0.021, respectively). Approximately 94% (n = 118) of the residents surveyed participated in virtual training during the pandemic, and 99.2% (n = 124) positively assessed the content and usefulness of online teaching in everyday clinical practice. The most common platforms used for online meetings were Zoom (62.7%, n = 79) and Microsoft Teams (50.8%, n = 64). Approximately 79% (n = 99) of residents believed that, after the pandemic is over, at least some of the training courses and conferences should be conducted online. In addition, 13.5% (n = 17) of residents reported that they would like to undergo training and specialization courses in virtual form only after the pandemic is over. In summary, the present findings indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted the implementation of the ophthalmology specialization program in Poland, with the greatest impact on surgical training. Trainees providing care to patients with COVID-19 are more likely to negatively assess the impact of the pandemic on the training process. Replacing traditional training with virtual methods was positively received by residents and considered very useful, and most residents reported a desire to maintain virtual training in ophthalmology in the future.","Konopińska, Joanna; Obuchowska, Iwona; Lisowski, Łukasz; Dub, Natalia; Dmuchowska, Diana Anna; Rękas, Marek",PLoS One,4,24

The relatively low RSV load makes it difficult to detect in frail, elderly, and severely immune-compromised patients. In the present study, we developed a locked nucleic acid–-based 1-tube nested real-time RT-PCR (OTNRT-PCR) assay with the advantages of extremely high sensitivity, facile operability, and less likelihood of cross-contamination. The sensitivity, specificity, and clinical performance of the OTNRT-PCR assay were compared in parallel with a conventional TaqMan probe-based real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) assay and a traditional 2-step nested RT-PCR assay. The limit of detection of the OTNRT-PCR assay was 1.02 × 10(−1) TCID50/mL, equivalent to the traditional 2-step nested RT-PCR assay and 25-fold lower than the qRT-PCR assay. Of 616 nasopharyngeal aspirates tested, 143 RSV-negative samples by qRT-PCR were confirmed as positive by sequencing the OTNRT-PCR products. We therefore conclude that OTNRT-PCR is more sensitive than qRT-PCR for detection of RSV in clinical samples.","Zhao, Li; Wang, Ji; Li, Gui-xia; Qiu, Fang-zhou; Chen, Chen; Zhao, Meng-chuan; Wang, Le; Duan, Su-xia; Feng, Zhi-shan; Ma, Xue-jun",Diagn Microbiol Infect Dis,4,1

As PBB shares common features with other pediatric conditions, further characterization is needed to improve diagnostic accuracy among clinicians. In this study, we aim to further delineate the clinical and laboratory features of PBB in a larger cohort, with a specific focus on concurrent viral detection. Methods Children with and without PBB (control subjects) undergoing flexible bronchoscopy were prospectively recruited. Basic immune function testing and lymphocyte subset analyses were performed. BAL specimens were processed for cellularity and microbiology. Viruses were identified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and bacteria were identified via culture. Results The median age of the 104 children (69% male) with PBB was 19 months (interquartile range [IQR], 12-30 mo). Compared with control subjects, children with PBB were more likely to have attended childcare (OR, 8.43; 95% CI, 2.34-30.46). High rates of wheeze were present in both groups, and tracheobronchomalacia was common. Children with PBB had significantly elevated percentages of neutrophils in the lower airways compared with control subjects, and adenovirus was more likely to be detected in BAL specimens in those with PBB (OR, 6.69; 95% CI, 1.50-29.80). Median CD56 and CD16 natural killer (NK) cell levels in blood were elevated for age in children with PBB (0.7 × 109/L; IQR, 0.5-0.9 cells/L). Conclusions Children with PBB are, typically, very young boys with prolonged wet cough and parent-reported wheeze who have attended childcare. Coupled with elevated NK-cell levels, the association between adenovirus and PBB suggests a likely role of viruses in PBB pathogenesis.","Wurzel, Danielle F.; Marchant, Julie M.; Yerkovich, Stephanie T.; Upham, John W.; Mackay, Ian M.; Masters, I.

Three-quarters of the welfare benefit of the vaccine can be achieved with a speed of 100,000 full vaccination per day. A 1-week delay in the vaccination campaign raises the death toll by approximately 2500, and it reduces wealth by 8 billion euros. Because of the large heterogeneity of the rates of hospitalization and mortality across age classes, it is critically important for the number of lives saved and for the economy to vaccinate older people first. Any departure from this policy has a welfare cost. Prioritizing the allocation of vaccines to the most vulnerable people save 70,000 seniors, but it also increases the death toll of younger people by 14,000. Vaccine nationalism is modeled by assuming two identical Frances, one with a vaccine production capacity and the other without it. If the production country vaccinates its entire population before exporting to the other, the global death toll would be increased by 20 %. I also measure the welfare impact of the strong French anti-vax movement, and of the prohibition of an immunity passport.","Gollier, Christian",Journal of benefit-cost analysis,4,12

In total, 36,466 participants from 28 geographical areas were identified in this cross-sectional, retrospective analysis of general practitioner (GP)-requested 25(OH)D tests at St James’s Hospital, Dublin between 2014 and 2018. The population were community-dwelling adults, median age 50.7 (18–109 years) with 15% of participants deficient (<30 nmol/L), rising to 23% in the winter. Deficiency was greatest in younger (18–39 years) and oldest (80+ years) adults, and in males versus females (18% vs. 11%, p < 0.001). Season was the biggest predictor of deficiency (OR 4.44, winter versus summer, p < 0.001), followed by location (west Dublin OR 2.17, north Dublin 1.54, south Dublin 1.42 versus rest of Ireland, p < 0.001) where several urban areas with an increased prevalence of deficiency were identified. There was no improvement in 25(OH)D over the 5-year period despite increased levels of testing. One in four adults were vitamin D deficient in the winter, with significant variations across locations and demographics. Overall this study identifies key groups at risk of 25(OH)D deficiency and insufficiency, thus providing important public health information for the targeting of interventions to optimise 25(OH)D.

The precise immune response profile is likely, therefore, to determine and predict patient outcomes and also represents a target for intervention. Anti-viral T cell exhaustion in the early stages is associated with disease progression. Dysregulation of T cell functions, which precedes cytokine storm development and neutrophil expansion in alveolar tissues heralds damaging pathology.T cell function, cytokine production and factors that attract neutrophils to the lung can be modified through targeting molecules that can modulate T cell responses. Manipulating T cell responses by targeting the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway could provide the means to control the immune response in COVID-19 patients. During the initial anti-viral response, T cell effector function can be enhanced by delaying anti-viral exhaustion through inhibiting PI3K and Akt. Additionally, immune dysregulation can be addressed by enhancing immune suppressor functions by targeting downstream mTOR, an important intracellular modulator of cellular metabolism. Targeting this signalling pathway also has potential to prevent formation of thrombi due to its role in platelet activation. Furthermore, this signalling pathway is essential for SARS-cov-2 virus replication in host cells and its inhibition could, therefore, reduce viral load. The ultimate goal is to identify targets that can quickly control the immune response in COVID-19 patients to improve patient outcome. Targeting different levels of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signalling pathway could potentially achieve this during each stage of the disease.","Abu-Eid, Rasha; Ward, Frank James",Immunol Lett,4,21

METHODS: In this cross-sectional, qualitative prospective study, a questionnaire was administered over the telephone to diabetes patients who had attended National Guard primary care centers in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. The survey included questions on demographic data, type of diabetes, medications used, comorbidities, medication compliance, and daily habits before and after the lockdown, and those assessing patients’ psychological parameters during the past month by using the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10). Data analysis was performed using SPSS program version 26. RESULTS: Totally, 394 patients participated. All of them had type 2 diabetes, and 37.6% had only one comorbidity. Antidiabetic monotherapy was used in 76.4% of the patients, while combination therapy was used in 23.6%. The compliance score before the lockdown was significantly higher (18.49 ± 3.05) than that after it (17.40 ± 3.25) (p-value <0.001).

In this study, we investigated the effect of an endocannabinoid, anandamide (AEA), on ARDS induced in the mouse by Staphylococcus Enterotoxin B (SEB). Administration of a single intranasal dose of SEB in mice and treated with exogenous AEA at a dose of 40 mg/kg body weight led to the amelioration of ARDS in mice. Clinically, plethysmography results indicated that there was an improvement in lung function after AEA treatment accompanied by a decrease of inflammatory cell infiltrate. There was also a significant decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-2, TNF-α, and IFN-γ, and immune cells including CD4(+) T cells, CD8(+) T cells, Vβ8(+) T cells, and NK(+) T cells in the lungs. Concurrently, an increase in anti-inflammatory phenotypes such as CD11b + Gr1+ Myeloid-derived Suppressor Cells (MDSCs), CD4 + FOXP3 + Tregs, and CD4(+)IL10 + cells was observed in the lungs. Microarray data showed that AEA treatment in ARDS mice significantly altered numerous miRNA including downregulation of miRNA-23a-3p, which caused an upregulation of arginase (ARG1), which encodes for arginase, a marker for MDSCs, as well as TGF-β2, which induces Tregs. AEA also caused down-regulation of miRNA-34a-5p which led to induction of FoxP3, a master regulator of Tregs. Transfection of T cells using miRNA-23a-3p or miRNA-34a-5p mimics and inhibitors confirmed that these miRNAs targeted ARG1, TGFβ2 and FoxP3. In conclusion, the data obtained from this study suggests that endocannabinoids such as AEA can attenuate ARDS induced by SEB by suppressing inflammation through down-regulation of key miRNA that regulate immunosuppressive pathways involving the induction of MDSCs and Tregs.","Sultan, Muthanna; Alghetaa, Hasan; Mohammed, Amirah; Abdulla, Osama A.; Wisniewski, Paul J.; Singh, Narendra; Nagarkatti, Prakash; Nagarkatti, Mitzi",Front Pharmacol,4,20

It has been reported that COVID-19 patients can potentially transmit the disease to others before developing symptoms. Thus, extensive surveillance and screening of individuals at risk of the disease is required to limit SARS-COV-2 spread. The COVID-19 respiratory triage score has been used for patient screening. We aimed to determine its diagnostic performance characteristics, which have not been adequately studied before. Methodology: This is a retrospective observational study involving all patients screened for COVID-19 at a tertiary care facility. Patients were tested using nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-COV-2 PCR. The Saudi CDC COVID-19 respiratory triage score was measured for all subjects. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predicted value of COVID-19 respiratory triage score were measured with reference to SARS-COV-2 PCR test. Multivariate regression analysis was done to identify factors that can predict a positive SARS-COV-2 PCR test. Result: A total of 1,435 subjects were included. The COVID-19 respiratory triage score provided a marginal diagnostic performance with a receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) area under the curve value of 0.60 (95% CI: 0.57–0.64). A triage score of 5 provided the best cut-off value for the combined sensitivity and specificity. Clinical characteristics that independently predicted positive COVID-19 PCR test include male sex (adjusted OR: 1.47; p = 0.034), healthcare workers and their family members (adjusted OR: 1.99; 95%; p = 0.016), fever (adjusted OR: 2.98; p < 0.001), and moderate disease severity (adjusted OR: 5; p < 0.001). Conclusion: The current COVID-19 respiratory triage score has marginal diagnostic performance characteristics. Its performance can improve by including additional predictors to the respiratory symptoms in order to avoid missing COVID-19 patients with atypical presentation and to limit unnecessary SARS-COV-2 PCR testing.","Aldobyany, Ahmad; Touman, Abdelfattah; Ghaleb, Nabil; Alsaggaf, Rajaa; Murtaza, Noureen; Hamada, Adel; Alknawy, Moataz; Albanna, Amr S.; Alqurashi, Eid",Front Med (Lausanne),4,24

Based on an online survey, this study examines adults’ exercise levels and patterns during the COVID-19 lockdown in Belgium. Ordinal logistic regression analyses of 13,515 valid and population-weighted responses indicate a general increase in exercise frequencies, as well as in sedentary behavior. Except for people aged 55+, previously low active adults self-reported to exercise more during the lockdown. Among the people who were already high active before COVID-19, those above 55 years old, those with low education, those used to exercise with friends or in a sport club, and those who were not using online tools to exercise, self-reported to exercise less during the lockdown. Having less time, sitting more, and missing the familiar way and competitive element of exercising were the main reasons for a self-reported exercise reduction. Given the health risks associated with physical inactivity, results imply that governments should consider how those who were not reached can be encouraged to exercise during a lockdown.

We sought to explore the outcomes of severe COVID-19 patients treated with a multi-mechanism approach (MMA) in addition to standard-of-care (SC) versus patients who only received SC treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data were collected retrospectively for patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). This observational cohort study was performed at five institutions, 3 in the United States and 2 in Honduras. Patients were stratified for MMA vs. SC treatment during ICU stay. MMA treatment consists of widely available medications started immediately upon hospitalization. These interventions target immunomodulation, anticoagulation, viral suppression, and oxygenation. Primary outcomes included in-hospital mortality and length of stay (LOS) for the index hospitalization and were measured using logistic regression. RESULTS: Of 86 patients admitted, 65 (76%) who had severe COVID-19 were included in the study; 30 (46%) patients were in SC group, compared with 35 (54%) patients treated with MMA group. Twelve (40%) patients in the SC group died, compared with 5 (14%) in the MMA group (p-value = 0.01, Chi squared test). After adjustment for gender, age, treatment group, Q-SOFA score, the MMA group had a mean length of stay 8.15 days, when compared with SC group with 13.55 days. ICU length of stay was reduced by a mean of 5.4 days (adjusted for a mean age of 54 years, p-value 0.03) and up to 9 days (unadjusted for mean age), with no significant reduction in overall adjusted mortality rate, where the strongest predictor of mortality was the use of mechanical ventilation. CONCLUSION: The finding that MMA decreases the average ICU length of stay by 5.4 days and up to 9 days in older patients suggests that implementation of this treatment protocol could allow a healthcare system to manage 60% more COVID-19 patients with the same number of ICU beds.","Valerio Pascua, Fernando; Diaz, Oscar; Medina, Rina; Contreras, Brian; Mistroff, Jeff; Espinosa, Daniel; Sekhon, Anupamjeet; Paz Handal, Diego; Pineda, Estela; Vargas Pineda, Miguel; Pineda, Hector; Diaz, Maribel; Lewis, Anita S.; Hesse, Heike; Castro Lainez, Miriams T.; Stevens, Mark L.; Sierra- Hoffman, Miguel; Ontai, Sidney C.; VanBuren, Vincent",PLoS One,4,9

Response to the pandemic in university settings included a rapid and unexpected shift to online learning for faculty and students. The transition to teaching and learning online posed many challenges, and the experiences of students during this crisis may inform future planning for distance learning experiences during the ongoing pandemic and beyond. Herein, we discuss the experiences of first‐ and second‐year university students enrolled in a biology seminar course as their classes migrated to online environments. Drawing on reported student experiences and prior research and resources, we discuss the ways we will adjust our own teaching for future iterations of the course while offering recommendations for instructors tasked with teaching in online environments.","Humphrey, Eve A.; Wiles, Jason R.",Ecol Evol,4,12

METHODS We assessed the effect of deploying SARS-Cov-2 vaccines on cold storage capacity and immunization workload in a simulated WHO African Region country using region-specific data on immunization, population, healthcare workers (HCWs), cold storage capacity (quartile values for national and subnational levels), and characteristics of an approved SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. We calculated monthly increases in vaccine doses, doses per vaccinator, and cold storage volumes for four-month SARS-CoV-2 vaccination campaigns targeting risk groups compared to routine immunization baselines. RESULTS Administering SARS-CoV-2 vaccines to risk groups would increase total monthly doses by 27.0% for ≥ 65 years, 91.7% for chronic diseases patients, and 1.1% for HCWs. Assuming median nurse density estimates adjusted for absenteeism and proportion providing immunization services, SARS-CoV-2 vaccination campaigns would increase total monthly doses per vaccinator by 29.3% for ≥ 65 years, 99.6% for chronic diseases patients, and 1.2% for HCWs. When we applied quartiles of actual African Region country vaccine storage capacity, routine immunization vaccine volumes exceeded national-level storage capacity for at least 75% of countries, but subnational levels had sufficient storage capacity for SARS-CoV-2 vaccines for at least 75% of countries. CONCLUSIONS In the WHO African Region, SARS-CoV-2 vaccination campaigns would substantially increase doses per vaccinator and cold storage capacity requirements over routine immunization baselines. Pandemic vaccination campaigns would increase storage requirements of national-level stores already at their limits, but sufficient capacity exists at subnational levels. Immediate attention to strengthening immunization systems is essential to support pandemic responses.","Ortiz, Justin R.; Robertson, Joanie; Hsu, Jui-Shan; Yu, Stephen L.; Driscoll, Amanda J.; Williams, Sarah R.; Chen, Wilbur H.; Fitzpatrick, Meagan C.; Sow, Samba; Biellik, Robin J.; Okwo-Bele, Jean-Marie; Neuzil, Kathleen M.",Vaccine,4,20

In-hospital mortality are high in severe cases and cardiac injury characterized by elevated cardiac troponin are common among them. The mechanism of cardiac injury and the relationship between cardiac injury and in-hospital mortality remained unclear. Studies focused on cardiac injury in COVID-19 patients are scarce. [Objectives] To investigate the association between cardiac injury and in-hospital mortality of patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19. [Methods] Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data of consecutive confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients admitted in Wuhan No.1 Hospital from 25th December, 2019 to 15th February, 2020 were extracted from electronic medical records and were retrospectively reviewed and analyzed. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis were used to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death. [Results] A total of 110 patients with confirmed (n=80) or suspected (n=30) COVID-19 were screened and 48 patients (female 31.3%, mean age 70.58{+/-}13.38 year old) among them with high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI) test within 48 hours after admission were included, of whom 17 (17/48, 35.4%) died in hospital while 31 (31/48, 64.6%) were discharged or transferred to other hospital. High-sensitivity cardiac troponin I was levated in 13 (13/48, 27.1%) patents. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed pulse oximetry of oxygen saturation (SpO2) on admission (HR 0.704, 95% CI 0.546-0.909, per 1% decrease, p=0.007), elevated hs-cTnI (HR 10.902, 95% 1.279-92.927, p=0.029) and elevated d-dimer (HR 1.103, 95%CI 1.034-1.176, per 1mg/L increase, p=0.003) on admission were independently associated with in-hospital mortality. [Conclusions] Cardiac injury defined by hs-cTnI elevation and elevated d-dimer on admission were risk factors for in-hospital death, while higher SpO2 could be seen as a protective factor, which could help clinicians to identify patients with adverse outcome at the early stage of COVID-19.","Zhang, F.; Yang, D.; Li, J.; Gao, P.; Chen, T.; Cheng, Z.; Cheng, K.; Fang, Q.; Pan, W.; Yi, C.; Fan, H.; Wu, Y.; Li, L.; Fang, Y.; Liu, J.; Tian, G.; He, L.",,4,22

The data arise from a prospective study of 47 households (493 individuals) in rural Kenya, followed through a 6-month period of an RSV seasonal outbreak. Deep nasopharyngeal swabs were collected twice each week from all household members, irrespective of symptoms, and tested for RSV by multiplex PCR. The RSV G gene was sequenced. A total of 205 RSV infection episodes were detected in 179 individuals from 40 different households. The infection data were interval censored and assuming a random event time between observations, the average duration of virus shedding was 11·2 (95% confidence interval 10·1–12·3) days. The shedding durations were longer than previous estimates (3·9–7·4 days) based on immunofluorescence antigen detection or viral culture, and were shown to be strongly associated with age, severity of infection, and revealed potential interaction with other respiratory viruses. These findings are key to our understanding of the spread of this important virus and are relevant in the design of control programmes.","MUNYWOKI, P. K.; KOECH, D. C.; AGOTI, C.

Knowledge of risk factors of coronavirus disease among Brazilians remains scarce, especially in the adult population. This study verified the risk factors for intensive care unit admission and mortality for coronavirus disease among 20-59-year-old Brazilians. METHODS: A Brazilian database on respiratory illness was analyzed on October 9, 2020, to gather data on age, sex, ethnicity, education, housing area, and comorbidities (cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity). Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the risk factors for coronavirus disease. RESULTS: Overall, 1,048,575 persons were tested for coronavirus disease; among them, 43,662 were admitted to the intensive care unit, and 34,704 patients died. Male sex (odds ratio=1.235 and 1.193), obesity (odds ratio=1.941 and 1.889), living in rural areas (odds ratio=0.855 and 1.337), and peri-urban areas (odds ratio=1.253 and 1.577) were predictors of intensive care unit admission and mortality, respectively. Cardiovascular disease (odds ratio=1.552) was a risk factor for intensive care unit admission. Indigenous people had reduced chances (odds ratio=0.724) for intensive care unit admission, and black, mixed, East Asian, and indigenous ethnicity (odds ratio=1.756, 1.564, 1.679, and 1.613, respectively) were risk factors for mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Risk factors for intensive care unit admission and mortality among adult Brazilians were higher in men, obese individuals, and non-urban areas.

This project encouraged registered nurses to quickly identify and isolate potentially infectious patients in the emergency room, to prevent exposures to airborne and droplet transmitted communicable diseases, including meningitis, tuberculosis (TB) and measles. METHODS: This pre and post-intervention model implemented a quasi-experimental designed project in the emergency room (ER). The Centers for Disease Control's (CDC) empiric transmission-based isolation precautions were implemented to prevent occupational health exposures. Eighty registered nurses (RN's) received education on the new intervention. The assumption of this project was, the new process will decrease occupational health exposures. RESULTS: Eight ER RNs reported an occupational health exposure, pre-intervention in quarter 2 of 2019, compared to zero occupational health exposures, post-intervention in quarter 3 of 2019. A Chi- square independence test was used to determine if the categorical variables of the capstone intervention and disease exposure were related in the same RN population. An association between the capstone intervention and disease exposure was observed, X2 (1) = 8.421, p=0.004, indicating the result is statistically significant. CONCLUSION: The P.R.I.D.E project effectively reduced occupational health exposures to airborne and droplet transmitted diseases in the emergency room by 100%.

In this paper, we propose a stochastic SEIHR (sSEIHR) model to describe such random fluctuations and provide sufficient conditions for stochastic stability of the disease-free equilibrium, based on the basic reproduction number that we estimated. Our extensive numerical results demonstrate strong threshold behavior near the estimated basic reproduction number, suggesting that the necessary conditions for stochastic stability are close to the sufficient conditions derived. Furthermore, we found that increasing the noise level slightly reduces the final proportion of infected individuals. In addition, we analyze COVID-19 data from various regions worldwide and demonstrate that by changing only a few parameter values, our sSEIHR model can accurately describe both the general trend and the random fluctuations in the number of daily new cases in each region, allowing governments and hospitals to make more accurate caseload predictions using fewer compartments and parameters than other comparable stochastic compartmental models.","Niu, Ruiwu; Chan, Yin-Chi; Wong, Eric W.

The aim of this study is to describe the epidemiology of COVID-19 in the ASEAN Federation of Endocrine Societies (AFES) member countries; to describe challenges, changes and opportunities in caring for patients with endocrine diseases, as well as in fellowship training programs, and endocrinerelated research in the AFES countries. METHODOLOGY: The AFES ASEAN Survey Of Needs in Endocrinology (AFES A.S.-O.N.E.) was an open-ended questionnaire that was sent to the presidents and representatives of the AFES member countries by email. Responses from Societies were collated and synthesized to obtain perspectives on the emergent issues in endocrinology in the Southeast Asian region during this pandemic. RESULTS: The burden of COVID-19 cases varied widely across the AFES member countries, with the least number of cases in Vietnam and Myanmar, and the greatest number of cases in either the most populous countries (Indonesia and the Philippines), or a country with the highest capability for testing (Singapore). The case fatality rate was also the highest for Indonesia and the Philippines at around 6%, and lowest for Vietnam at no fatalities. The percentage with diabetes among patients with COVID-19 ranged from 5% in Indonesia to 20% in Singapore, approximating the reported percentages in China and the United States. The major challenges in managing patients with endocrine diseases involved inaccessibility of health care providers, clinics and hospitals due to the implementation of lockdowns, community quarantines or movement control among the member countries. This led to disruptions in the continuity of care, testing and monitoring, and for some, provision of both preventive care and active management including surgery for thyroid cancer or pituitary and adrenal tumors, and radioactive iodine therapy. Major disruptions in the endocrine fellowship training programs were also noted across the region, so that some countries have had to freeze hiring of new trainees or to revise both program requirements and approaches to training due to the closure of outpatient endocrine clinics. The same observations are seen for endocrine-related researches, as most research papers have focused on the pandemic. Finally, the report ends by describing innovative approaches to fill in the gap in training and in improving patient access to endocrine services by Telemedicine. CONCLUSION: The burden of COVID-19 cases and its case fatality rate varies across the AFES member countries but its impact is almost uniform: it has disrupted the provision of care for patients with endocrine diseases, and has also disrupted endocrine fellowship training and endocrine-related research across the region. Telemedicine and innovations in training have been operationalized across the AFES countries in an attempt to cope with the disruptions from COVID-19, but its over-all impact on the practice of endocrinology across the region will only become apparent once we conquer this pandemic.","Jasul, Gabriel; Paz-Pacheco, Elizabeth; Jimeno, Cecilia; Suastika, Ketut; Hussein, Zanariah; Mustafa, Norlaila; Aung, Aye Aye; Robles, Jeremyjones; Leow, Melvin Khee Shing; Deerochanawong, Chaicharn; Khue, Nguyen Thy; Dang, Tran Huu",J ASEAN Fed Endocr Soc,4,1

We review the available cell lines and models of the intestine and their potential uses. Tumor derived cell lines such as Caco-2, T84 and HT-29 are widely used despite many drawbacks, which are discussed with respect to complexity of the gut, where various cell types interact with commensal microbiota and gut-associated lymphoid tissue.

Like most of the affected countries in the globe, India is now facing serious crisis due to COVID-19 in the recent times. The evaluation of the present status of the provinces affected by COVID-19 is very much essential to the government authorities to impose preventive strategies in controlling the spread of COVID-19 and to take necessary measures. In this article, a computational methodology is developed to estimate the present status of states and provinces which are affected due to COVID-19 using a fuzzy inference system. The factors such as population density, number of COVID-19 tests, confirmed cases of COVID-19, recovery rate, and mortality rate are considered as the input parameters of the proposed methodology. Considering positive and negative factors of the input parameters, the rule base is developed using triangular fuzzy numbers to capture uncertainties associated with the model. The application potentiality is validated by evaluating Pearson’s correlation coefficient. A sensitivity analysis is also performed to observe the changes of final output by varying the tolerance ranges of the inputs. The results of the proposed method show that some of the provinces have very poor performance in controlling the spread of COVID-19 in India. So, the government needs to take serious attention to deal with the pandemic situation of COVID-19 in those provinces.","Ghosh, Bappaditya; Biswas, Animesh",Appl Soft Comput,4,26

The authors move from the automatic generation of a rule-based knowledge base from source data by clustering rules in the knowledge base to optimize inference processes and to detecting unusual rules allowing for the optimal structure of rule groups. The paper presents a two-phase procedure, wherein in the first phase, we look for the optimal structure of rule clusters when there are outlier rules in the knowledge base. In the second phase, we detect outliers in the rules using the LOF (Local Outlier Factor) algorithm. Then we eliminate the unusual rules from the database and check whether the selected cluster quality measures are responded positively to the elimination of outliers, which would indicate that the rules were rightly considered outliers. The performed experiments confirmed the effectiveness of the LOF algorithm and selected cluster quality measures in the context of detecting atypical rules. The detection of such rules can support knowledge engineers or domain experts in knowledge mining to improve the completeness of the knowledge base, which is usually the basis of the decision support system.","Brzezińska, Agnieszka Nowak; Horyń, Czesław",Procedia Computer Science,4,1

METHODS: A team of local experts, called the ‘Community COVID-19 Initial Assessment team’ (CCIAT), co-ordinated the initial medical assessment and decisions for all newly diagnosed community patients. Data of all patients were collected prospectively and stored in one database. These data were then analysed to extract the demographics and outcomes of all these patients. RESULTS: Through telemedicine, the majority (91%) of 369 infected patients were managed safely in the community. Only a minority of patients (6%) was admitted to the main acute hospitals and there was no increased morbidity or mortality related to the medical decisions made using this telemedicine tool. CONCLUSIONS: This population-based study proves that this particular COVID-19 telemedicine project in Malta achieved its main goals, which were namely that of relieving the burden on the main local acute hospitals whilst ensuring the optimal medical management to infected patients.","Cassar, Mary Rose; Borg, Denise; Camilleri, Lianne; Schembri, Aaron; Anastasi, Eloise Agius; Buhagiar, Kenneth; Callus, Claire; Grech, Michelle",Int J Infect Dis,4,1

As there is no effective drug or vaccine, it is urgent to find therapeutic drugs that can serve to deal with the current epidemic situation in all countries and regions. We searched drugs and response measures for SARS-CoV-2 in the PubMed database, and then updated the potential targets and therapeutic drugs from the perspective of the viral replication cycle. The drug research studies of the viral replication cycle are predominantly focused on the process of the virus entering cells, proteases, and RdRp. The inhibitors of the virus entry to cells and RdRp, such as Arbidol, remdesivir, favipiravir, EIDD-2081, and ribavirin, are in clinical trials, while most of the protease inhibitors are mainly calculated by molecular docking technology, which needs in vivo and in vitro experiments to prove the effect for SARS-CoV-2. This review summarizes the drugs targeting the viral replication process and provides a basis and directions for future drug development and reuse on the protein level of COVID-19.","Zhang, Yi; Tang, Liang V.",J Proteome Res,4,9

E-learning leads to an escalation in digitalization of handwritten documents because it requires submission of homework and assignments through online. To help teachers in checking digitalized handwritten homework, this paper proposes an automatic checking system based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) for handwritten numeral recognition. The CNN is used to recognize four arithmetic operations in mathematical questions consisting of addition, deduction, multiplication and division. The performance CNN in handwritten numeral recognition have been optimized in terms of activation function and gradient descent algorithm. The proposed CNN is also trained and tested with the MNIST handwritten data set. The experimental results show that the recognition accuracy the improved CNN improves to a certain extent as compared to before optimization.","ShanWei, Chen; LiWang, Shir; Foo, Ng Theam; Ramli, Dzati Athiar",Procedia Computer Science,4,1

METHOD: This paper presents pre-planned interim analyses of data from a cross-sectional epidemiological study. Levels of physical activity during COVID-I9 social distancing were self-reported. Mental health was measured using the Beck Anxiety and Depression Inventory. Mental wellbeing was measured using The Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale. Participants also reported on sociodemographic and clinical data. The association between physical activity and mental health was studied using regression models. RESULTS: 902 adults were included in this study (63.8% of women and 50.1% of people aged 35–64 years). After adjusting for covariates, there was a negative association between moderate-to-vigorous physical activity per day in hours and poor mental health (OR = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.80–0.97). Similar findings were obtained for moderate-to-severe anxiety symptoms, moderate-to-severe depressive symptoms and poor mental wellbeing.

In the spring of 2008, a large, unprecedented HFMD outbreak in Fuyang city of Anhui province in the central part of southeastern China resulted in a high aggregation of fatal cases. In this study, epidemiologic and clinical investigations, laboratory testing, and genetic analyses were performed to identify the causal pathogen of the outbreak. Of the 6,049 cases reported between 1 March and 9 May of 2008, 3023 (50%) were hospitalized, 353 (5.8%) were severe and 22 (0.36%) were fatal. HEV71 was confirmed as the etiological pathogen of the outbreak. Phylogenetic analyses of entire VP1 capsid protein sequence of 45 Fuyang HEV71 isolates showed that they belong to C4a cluster of the C4 subgenotype. In addition, genetic recombinations were found in the 3D region (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, a major component of the viral replication complex of the genome) between the Fuyang HEV71 strain and Coxsackievirus A16 (CV-A16), resulting in a recombination virus.

AIMS: This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of psychological problems in different healthcare workers (ie, physicians, medical residents, nurses, technicians and public health professionals) during the COVID-19 pandemic in China and explore factors that are associated with the onset of psychological problems in this population during this public health crisis. METHODS: A cross-sectional, web-based survey was conducted in February 2020 among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Psychological problems were assessed using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale, Patient Health Questionnaire and Insomnia Severity Index. Logistic regression analyses were used to explore the factors that were associated with psychological problems. RESULTS: The prevalence of symptoms of anxiety, depression, insomnia and the overall psychological problems in healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic in China was 46.04%, 44.37%, 28.75% and 56.59%, respectively. The prevalence of the overall psychological problems in physicians, medical residents, nurses, technicians and public health professionals was 60.35%, 50.82%, 62.02%, 57.54% and 62.40%, respectively. Compared with healthcare workers who did not participate in front-line work, front-line healthcare workers had a higher risk of anxiety, insomnia and overall psychological problems. In addition, attention to negative or neutral information about the pandemic, receiving negative feedback from families and friends who joined front-line work, and unwillingness to join front-line work if given a free choice were three major factors for these psychological problems. CONCLUSIONS: Psychological problems are pervasive among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Receiving negative information and participating in front-line work appear to be important risk factors for psychological problems. The psychological health of different healthcare workers should be protected during the COVID-19 pandemic with timely interventions and proper information feedback.","Que, Jianyu; Shi, Le; Deng, Jiahui; Liu, Jiajia; Zhang, Li; Wu, Suying; Gong, Yimiao; Huang, Weizhen; Yuan, Kai; Yan, Wei; Sun, Yankun; Ran, Maosheng; Bao, Yanping; Lu, Lin",Gen Psychiatr,4,26

Studies have forecasted future trends of the incidence of 2019-nCoV infection, but appeared unsuccessful. Farrs law is a classic epidemiology theory/practice for predicting epidemics. Therefore, we used and validated a model based on Farrs law to predict the daily-incidence of 2019-nCoV infection in China and 2 regions of high-incidence. MethodsWe extracted the 2019-nCoV incidence data of China, Hubei Province and Wuhan City from websites of the Chinese and Hubei health commissions. A model based on Farrs law was developed using the data available on Feb. 8, 2020, and used to predict daily-incidence of 2019-nCoV infection in China, Hubei Province and Wuhan City afterward. ResultsWe observed 50,995 (37001 on or before Feb. 8) incident cases in China from January 16 to February 15, 2020. The daily-incidence has peaked in China, Hubei Providence and Wuhan City, but with different downward slopes. If no major changes occur, our model shows that the daily-incidence of 2019-nCoV will drop to single-digit by February 25 for China and Hubei Province, but by March 8 for Wuhan city. However, predicted 75% confidence intervals of daily-incidence in all 3 regions of interest had an upward trend. The predicted trends overall match the prospectively-collected data, confirming usefulness of these models. ConclusionsThis study shows the daily-incidence of 2019-nCoV in China, Hubei Province and Wuhan City has reached the peak and was decreasing.

HSANs have been classified into eight groups based on mode of inheritance, clinical features, and the involved genes. HSAN-VI, perhaps the most notable type, is an autosomal recessive disease, which manifests as the severely impaired pain sensitivity, autonomic disturbances, distal myopathy, spontaneous or surgical amputations, and sometimes early death. Mutations in DST have been identified as the cause of HSAN-VI. DST encodes dystonin, a member of the plakin protein family that is involved in cytoskeletal filament networks. Dystonin has seven major isoforms in nerve, muscle, and epithelium. Material and Methods: The present study investigated a Chinese family with HSAN and explored potential pathogenic variants using whole-exome sequencing (WES). Variants were screened and filtered through bioinformatics analysis and prediction of variant pathogenicity. Co-segregation analysis was subsequently conducted. Results: We identified compound heterozygous variants of DST (c.3304G>A, p.V1102I and c.13796G>A, p.R4599H) in two patients.

L. javanica treatment resulted in a reduction in total WBC count as well as eosinophils, lymphocytes and neutrophils in BALF. L. javanica inhibited Th2-mediated immune response, which was evident by a decrease in serum IgE and inflammatory cytokines: IL-4, IL-5, IL-13 and TNF-α. L. javanica treatment also reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) and NO, and increased superoxide dismutase, glutathione and total antioxidant capacity. Histology showed significant attenuation of lung infiltration of inflammatory cells, alveolar thickening, and bronchiole smooth muscle thickening. CONCLUSION: L. javanica suppressed allergic airway inflammation by reducing Th2-mediated immune response and oxidative stress in OVA-sensitized rats which may be attributed to the presence of phenolic compound in the plant. This finding validates the traditional use of L. javanica in the treatment of respiratory disorders.","Mfengu, Mvuyisi O.

Now, allocation practices have stepped into the spotlight. Following Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines, states and healthcare institutions initially prioritised healthcare personnel and elderly residents of congregant facilities; other groups at elevated risk for severe complications are now becoming eligible through locally administered programmes. The question remains, however: who else should be prioritised for immunisation? Here, we call attention to individuals institutionalised with severe mental illnesses and/or developmental or intellectual disabilities—a group highly susceptible to the damages of COVID-19, recent research shows, and critical to consider for priority vaccination. The language describing both federal-level and state-level intentions for this population remains largely vague, despite the population’s diversity across age, diagnosis, functional status and living arrangement. Such absence of specificity, in turn, leaves room for confusion and even neglect of various subgroups. We review data stressing this group’s vulnerability, as well as select state plans for priority vaccination, highlighting the importance of clarity when describing intentions to vaccinate, or even generally care for, diverse populations composed of distinct subgroups in need.","Shevzov-Zebrun, Nina; Caplan, Arthur L",J Med Ethics,4,16

This work estimates the effects of individual socioeconomic characteristics on the risk of death by Covid-19. METHODS: Logistic models were estimated to assess the effect of socioeconomic characteristics (income, race/ethnicity, schooling, occupation and economic activity) on the risk of death from Covid-19. For this purpose, Covid-19 individual death records in Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil were combined with the Annual Register of Social Information, which contains socioeconomic information about formal workers. FINDINGS: Workers employed in establishments in the health and public safety sectors present a risk of dying 2.46 and 2.25 times higher than those employed in other activities. Non-white people, men, and those who work in the Metropolitan Region are also more likely to die from Covid-19. People with higher education are 44% less likely to die from the disease. CONCLUSIONS: Some population groups are more vulnerable to the Covid-19 pandemic and individual socioeconomic conditions play a relevant role in the probability of death by the disease. That should be considered in the design of prevention policies to be adopted.","De Negri, F; Galiezz, R; Miranda, P; Koeller, P; Zucoloto, G; Costa, J; Farias, C M; Travassos, G H; Medronho, R A",J Public Health (Oxf),4,3

The outcome of the ICSI/IVF cycles in terms of oocytes, embryos and pregnancy rates according to the approach of semen sample collection (at home or at clinic) was evaluated. RESULTS: Compared to samples collected at the clinic, semen samples collected at home had significantly higher mean spermatozoa concentrations (60.7 ± 33.0 million/ml vs. 51.9 ± 36.9 million/ml; P=0.001), higher total sperm counts (156.3±113.6 million vs. 138.6±131.4 million; P=0.004) and better motility (59.5% ± 19.6% vs. 55.1% ± 21.9%; P=0.005). The number of retrieved oocytes per cycle was similar (collected at home vs. at clinic; 8.6±7.1 vs. 9.1±6.4; P=0.341). The mean number of embryos was similar between the groups (4.4±4.3 vs. 4.5±3.8; P=0.740), but the blastocyst rate was significantly higher in group where semen was collected at home (52.2% vs. 46.4%; P=0.001).

Aqueous humor samples were collected from 58 untreated-naïve nvAMD patients prior to the intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF and 51 age-matched cataract control patients, and LRG1 concentration was measured by ELISA. The level of LRG1 immunostaining is frequently high in both the endothelial cells of the blood vessels, and myofibroblasts in the surrounding tissue of CNVMs of treatment-naïve nvAMD patients.

Severe pneumonia was defined as an oxygen saturation ≤ 93% at room air. Expressions of molecules related to T-cell activation and functions were analyzed by flow cytometry. Results The population dynamics of T cells at the first week were not different between the two groups. However, total numbers of CD4+ and CD8 + T cells tended to be lower in the severe group at the third week of illness. Expressions of Ki-67, PD-1, perforin, and granzyme B in CD4+ or CD8+ T cells were significantly higher in the severe group than in the mild group at the third week. In contrast to the mild group, the levels of their expression did not decrease in severe group.

METHODS: From April 2020 to the present, virtual sessions were created via Zoom Videos Communications, Inc. (San Jose, CA, USA). A survey composed of 15 questions about the perceived quality and utility of the virtual sessions was developed. The survey was sent out to all general surgery residents of a general surgery program in November of 2020. RESULTS: All residents enrolled in the program answered the survey, i.e., 22 (73.3%) men and 8 (26.7%) women with 6 (20.2%) residents per year (PGY 1–PGY 5). Over half of residents (n = 17, 56.7%) felt similar academic performance during online sessions when compared to the older model. Perceptions of the level of organization of academic sessions increased during the online model (n = 20, 66.7%).

Few studies have comparatively characterized these two conditions in relation to the presence of comorbidities, pre-hospitalization treatments, symptoms at admission, and laboratory variables associated with COVID-19 severity. Our study generated several interesting findings. Patients with COVID-associated hyperglycaemia had significantly less comorbidities, increased levels of inflammatory markers, and indicators of multi-organ injury than those with pre-existing diabetes, while islet autoimmunity prevalence and anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses were similar. COVID-associated hyperglycaemia was associated with a poorer clinical outcome and a longer viral clearance time compared to pre-existing diabetes. This strongly supports the need to screen all COVID-19 patients for hyperglycaemia at the time of admission despite a mute personal or family history of diabetes and to treat them in order to reach and maintain good glycemic control during hospitalization for COVID-19 pneumonia. ABSTRACT: Aim. The aim of the current study was to compare clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, and major outcomes of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia with COVID-associated hyperglycaemia or pre-existing diabetes. Methods. A cohort of 176 adult patients with a diagnosis of pre-existing diabetes (n = 112) or COVID-associated hyperglycaemia (n = 55) was studied. Results. Patients with COVID-associated hyperglycaemia had lower BMI, significantly less comorbidities, and higher levels of inflammatory markers and indicators of multi-organ injury than those with pre-existing diabetes. No differences between pre-existing diabetes and COVID-associated hyperglycaemia were evident for symptoms at admission, the humoral response against SARS-CoV-2, or autoantibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase or interferon alpha-4. COVID-associated hyperglycaemia was independently associated with the risk of adverse clinical outcome, which was defined as ICU admission or death (HR 2.11, 95% CI 1.34–3.31; p = 0.001), even after adjustment for age, sex, and other selected variables associated with COVID-19 severity. Furthermore, at the same time, we documented a negative association (HR 0.661, 95% CI 0.43–1.02; p = 0.063) between COVID-associated hyperglycaemia to swab negativization. Conclusions. Recognizing hyperglycaemia as a specific clinical entity associated with COVID-19 pneumonia is relevant for early and appropriate patient management and close monitoring for the progression of disease severity.","Laurenzi, Andrea; Caretto, Amelia; Molinari, Chiara; Bazzigaluppi, Elena; Brigatti, Cristina; Marzinotto, Ilaria; Mercalli, Alessia; Melzi, Raffaella; Nano, Rita; Tresoldi, Cristina; Landoni, Giovanni; Ciceri, Fabio; Lampasona, Vito; Scavini, Marina; Piemonti, Lorenzo",Biology (Basel),4,27

With a sense of urgency, many groups have proposed repurposing approved drugs for other indications that might be deployed rapidly to control the viral infection or improve host responses. However, many of these therapies are based on drug availability rather than on a rational understanding of important steps in pathogenesis, particularly in the lungs, that lead to critical illness and life-threatening acute respiratory failure. Here we propose that the viral infection initially triggers a profound activation of innate immunity in the lungs that generates a self-perpetuating cytokine storm affecting the entire body. Inhibiting key proximal points in innate immunity pathways is feasible and offers a science-based approach to improving outcomes in moderate to severe COVID-19 illness.","Martin, Thomas R.; Wurfel, Mark M.; Zanoni, Ivan; Ulevitch, Richard",EBioMedicine,4,0

The letter is written by members of the CAREWELL team, a HRB-funded project that aims to promote health and self-care behaviours among working family carers. Family carers provide care to family and friends in the community who need support due to old-age, disability and chronic illness. In many cases, family carers are supporting those who are considered most at risk in this pandemic meaning carers must reduce their own risk of infection in order to protect their dependent family members. The temporary reduction of some home care services, as well as school and creche closures, means that family carers are providing increased levels of care with little or no support. At a time when both worlds of work and care have been dramatically transformed, we wish to shed light on those who are currently balancing paid employment with a family caregiving role. We argue that there is much to be learned from the recent work restrictions that could benefit employees, including working family carers, beyond this pandemic. We also wish to build on the potential positives of a transformed society and encourage policy makers and employers to focus on what is currently being implemented, and to identify which measures could be used to create a bedrock of policies and practices that would offer robust and effective support to family carers. It is hoped that family carers will receive greater recognition for the significant role they play in society, providing essential care and alleviating the strain on health and social care systems, both during and post the COVID-19 pandemic.","Phillips, Dominique; Paul, Gillian; Fahy, Majella; Dowling-Hetherington, Linda; Kroll, Thilo; Moloney, Breda; Duffy, Clare; Fealy, Gerard; Lafferty, Attracta",HRB Open Res,4,24

To temporarily relieve psychological distress, self-soothing behavior is common, including engagement in sexual behaviors that are linked to positive mental well-being. Considering the COVID-19 pandemic further exacerbated many mental health ailments alongside physical distancing regulations, we specifically examined online sexual behavior via the use of emergent digital sexual technologies, or sextech. In a 2019 study of 8004 American adults, we assessed whether people experiencing higher anxiety, depression, and/or loneliness were more likely to engage in sextech use. Furthermore, we examined whether anxiety or depression mediated the association between loneliness and sextech use, as loneliness is one contributor to anxiety and depression. People with higher anxiety and depression were more likely to engage in sextech. However, those who were more lonely were less likely to engage with sextech, suggesting the aforementioned patterns were not due to lack of social connection. Our findings suggest people with mental health struggles may be drawn to interactive, digital forms of sexual behavior as a means of alleviating symptoms through distraction or self-soothing. This insight offers an important pathway for expanding the scope of mental health interventions, particularly as technology becomes increasingly prevalent and accessible in everyday life.","Marcotte, Alexandra S.; Kaufman, Ellen M.; Campbell, Jessica T.; Reynolds, Tania A.; Garcia, Justin R.; Gesselman, Amanda N.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,4,3

The immune system is pivotal to fight potential invaders and prevent the establishment of infections in the respiratory tract; however, excessive, misplaced or altered immune responses contribute to increase tissue damage, impair lung function, and exacerbate respiratory diseases. Indeed, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and cystic fibrosis are respiratory diseases that have uncontrolled inflammation as a unifying severity factor. In addition, the acute inflammatory responses in pneumonia must be controlled to avoid progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome, which can be lethal. In this regard, immunomodulatory therapies are promising pharmacological strategies to treat important respiratory pathologies. Understanding the pathogenesis of respiratory disorders have paved the way for the development of cytokine-directed therapies, allosteric or non-allosteric inhibitors of inflammatory receptors and enzymes, agonists of resolution of inflammation and other anti-inflammatory compounds.

An underappreciated risk in current regulatory guidelines and scholarly discussions, however, is that the persisting input of chemical disinfectants can exacerbate the growth of biocide-tolerant and antibiotic-resistant bacteria on those surfaces and allow their direct transfers to humans. For COVID-19, the most commonly used disinfecting agents are quaternary ammonium compounds, hydrogen peroxide, sodium hypochlorite, and ethanol, which account for two-thirds of the active ingredients in current EPA-approved disinfectant products for the novel coronavirus. Tolerance to each of these compounds, which can be either intrinsic or acquired, has been observed on various bacterial pathogens. Of those, mutations and horizontal gene transfer, upregulation of efflux pumps, membrane alteration, and biofilm formation are the common mechanisms conferring biocide tolerance in bacteria. Further, the linkage between disinfectant use and antibiotic resistance was suggested in laboratory and real-life settings. Evidence showed that substantial bacterial transfers to hands could effectuate from short contacts with surrounding surfaces and further from fingers to lips. While current literature on disinfectant-induced antimicrobial resistance predominantly focuses on municipal wastes and the natural environments, in reality the community and public settings are most severely impacted by intensive and regular chemical disinfecting during COVID-19 and, due to their proximity to humans, biocide-tolerant and antibiotic-resistant bacteria emerged in these environments may pose risks of direct transfers to humans, particularly in densely populated urban communities. Here we highlight these risk factors by reviewing the most pertinent and up-to-date evidence, and provide several feasible strategies to mitigate these risks in the scenario of a prolonging pandemic.","Chen, Bo; Han, Jie; Dai, Han; Jia, Puqi",Environ Pollut,4,20

Italian Northern regions are among the most badly affected areas. Surfaces represent matrices to which particular attention should be paid for prevention and control of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. A few studies have highlighted virus presence on surfaces. We report the evidence of its presence on hospital surfaces, in a single room hosting a patient whose nose-pharyngeal swab resulted positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA at the admission. The surfaces sampling was carried out using pre-wetted swabs followed by extraction and amplification of viral RNA by reverse Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (rRT-PCR). A total of 4/15 (26.66%) surfaces were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA: the right bed rail, the call button, the bed trapeze bar, the stethoscope; moreover, the patient’s inner surgical mask was positive, showing the emission of the virus from the patient. This study is a further confirmation that the surfaces represent a potential vehicle of transmission. This supports the need for strict adherence to hand and environmental hygiene.

There is a growing trend to consider mental health symptoms of youth involved with the foster care system from a developmental trauma perspective. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to test if trauma, race, age, and gender predicted variability in thought problems and aggression for youth in foster care. METHOD: The sample (n = 303) included youth in out-of-home placements with a mean age of 14 years, a diverse racial demographic, and almost an equal percentage of males and females. Participants were assessed over three waves using a series of multilevel growth curve models. RESULTS: Results indicated significant decreases in thought problems and aggression and youth with higher levels of trauma reported higher initial levels and swifter decreases of both thought problems and aggression over time. CONCLUSIONS: While trauma was associated with aggression and thought problems, results found that youth demonstrated significant decreases in aggression and thought problems over time. A better understanding of the long-term effects of trauma on thought problems and aggression of youth in foster care is needed. While our findings suggest foster care may be protective in fostering resilience, additional research on the nature of potential positive effects of foster care on aggression and thought problems is suggested.","Farley, Tatjana M.; McWey, Lenore M.; Ledermann, Thomas",Child Youth Care Forum,4,23

To gain an understanding of the evolution of the newly emerging SARS-CoV-2, we herein analyzed the codon usage pattern of SARS-CoV-2. For this purpose, we compared the codon usage of SARS-CoV-2 with that of other viruses belonging to the subfamily of Orthocoronavirinae. We found that SARS-CoV-2 has a high AU content that strongly influences its codon usage, which appears to be better adapted to the human host. We also studied the evolutionary pressures that influence the codon usage of five conserved coronavirus genes encoding the viral replicase, spike, envelope, membrane and nucleocapsid proteins. We found different patterns of both mutational bias and natural selection that affect the codon usage of these genes. Moreover, we show here that the two integral membrane proteins (matrix and envelope) tend to evolve slowly by accumulating nucleotide mutations on their corresponding genes. Conversely, genes encoding nucleocapsid (N), viral replicase and spike proteins (S), although they are regarded as are important targets for the development of vaccines and antiviral drugs, tend to evolve faster in comparison to the two genes mentioned above. Overall, our results suggest that the higher divergence observed for the latter three genes could represent a significant barrier in the development of antiviral therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2.","Dilucca, Maddalena; Forcelloni, Sergio; Georgakilas, Alexandros G.; Giansanti, Andrea; Pavlopoulou, Athanasia",Viruses,4,16

In this study, going out in public amidst the spread of COVID-19 infections was investigated by examining new polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positive cases of COVID-19 and its relationship to four indicators of people going out in public (the people flow, the index of web searches for going outside, the number of times people browse restaurants, and the number of hotel guests), from the Regional Economic and Social Analysis System (V-RESAS). Two waves of COVID-19 infections were examined with cross-correlation analysis. In the first wave, all four indicators of going out reacted oppositely with the change in new PCR positive cases, showing a lag period of -1 to +6 weeks. In the second wave, the same relationship was only observed for the index of web searches for going outside. These results suggest that going out in public could not be described by new PCR positive cases alone in the second wave, even though they could explain people going out to some extent in the first wave.","Takahashi, H.; Terada, I.; Higuchi, T.; Takada, D.; Shin, J.-h.; Kunisawa, S.; Imanaka, Y.",,4,16

OBJECTIVE: To investigate clinical manifestations in adults aged 18–65 years hospitalized for COVID-19 and identify predictors of poor outcome. Secondary objectives: to explore differences compared to the disease in elderly patients and the suitability of the commonly used community-acquired pneumonia prognostic scales in younger populations. METHODS: Multicenter prospective registry of consecutive patients hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia aged 18–65 years between March and May 2020. We considered a composite outcome of “poor outcome” including intensive care unit admission and/or use of noninvasive ventilation, continuous positive airway pressure or high flow nasal cannula oxygen and/or death. RESULTS: We identified 513 patients < 65 years of age, from a cohort of 993 patients. 102 had poor outcomes (19.8%) and 3.9% died. 78% and 55% of patients with poor outcomes were classified as low risk based on CURB and PSI scores, respectively. A multivariate Cox regression model identified six independent factors associated with poor outcome: heart disease, absence of chest pain or anosmia, low oxygen saturation, high LDH and lymphocyte count < 800/mL. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 in younger patients carries significant morbidity and differs in some respects from this disease in the elderly. Baseline heart disease is a relevant risk factor, while anosmia and pleuritic pain are associated to better prognosis. Hypoxemia, LDH and lymphocyte count are predictors of poor outcome. We consider that CURB and PSI scores are not suitable criteria for deciding admission in this population.","Tabernero, Eva; Ruiz, Luis A.; España, Pedro P.; Méndez, Raúl; Serrano, Leyre; Santos, Borja; Uranga, Ane; González, Paula; Garcia, Patricia; Torres, Antoni; Menendez, Rosario; Zalacain, Rafael",Infection,4,3

The eggs in the infected and control groups were challenged with 0.2 mL of 10(5.5) ELD(50) NIBV and sterile saline solution, respectively. The embryonic chickens’ plasma and liver and kidney tissues were collected at 1, 3, and 5 days post-inoculation (dpi), the liver and kidney functional parameters were quantified, and the tissue viral loads were determined with real-time PCR. The results showed that plasma potassium, sodium, chlorine, magnesium, calcium, and phosphorus levels were increased. The infected group exhibited significantly higher plasma uric acid, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine levels than the control group at 3 dpi. The plasma concentrations of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase were significantly increased in the infected group. The total protein, albumin, and globulin levels in the infected group were significantly lower than those in the control group. The liver-kidney viral load in the infected group peaked at 3 dpi, at which time the kidney viral load was significantly higher than that of the liver. Our results indicated that NIBV infection caused liver and kidney damage in the embryonic chickens, and the results also demonstrated that the liver and kidney damage was strongly related to the tissue viral load following NIBV infection in embryonic chickens.","Huang, Qiqi; Gao, Xiaona; Liu, Ping; Lin, Huayuan; Liu, Weilian; Liu, Guohui; Zhang, Jin; Deng, Guangfu; Zhang, Caiying; Cao, Huabin; Guo, Xiaoquan; Hu, Guoliang",Poult Sci,4,10

The rapid spread of PEDV has raised concerns about the role of feed and particularly pork-by-product components such as spray-dried porcine plasma (SDPP) in PEDV transmission. The aim of this study was to determine the infectivity of PEDV RNA present in commercial SDPP. Specifically, 40 3-week-old PEDV naïve pigs were randomly assigned to one of five treatment groups. At day post inoculation (dpi) 0, NEG-CONTROL pigs were sham-inoculated, PEDV-CONTROL pigs received cell culture propagated PEDV, and SDPP-CONTROL pigs were switched to a diet with 5% SDPP containing 5.1±0.1 log(10) PEDV RNA copies/g. To evaluate a potential positive effect of anti-PEDV antibodies in SDPP on PEDV challenge, four days prior to PEDV challenge the pigs in the SDPP-PEDV group were switched to and remained on a 5% SDPP diet through dpi 28. Another group, EGG-PEDV, was orally administered a commercial egg-derived liquid PEDV globulin product from dpi -4 through 6. All PEDV-CONTROL pigs began shedding PEDV in feces by dpi 3 and seroconverted between dpi 7 and 14, whereas pigs in NEG-CONTROL and SDPP-CONTROL groups remained PEDV RNA negative and did not seroconvert to PEDV for the study duration. This indicates no evidence of infectivity of the PEDV RNA in the SDPP lot utilized. Furthermore, under the study conditions SDPP or egg-derived liquid PEDV globulin addition did not significantly alter PEDV-shedding or overall disease course after experimental challenge.","Opriessnig, Tanja; Xiao, Chao-Ting; Gerber, Priscilla F.; Zhang, Jianqiang; Halbur, Patrick G.",PLoS One,4,1

Methods: The RNA was amplified with sequence-independent single primer amplification (SISPA) and high-throughput sequencing was performed on the Ion Torrent platform. The generated sequences were subjected to quality check and classfied by BLAST. CodonCode aligner and SeqMan were used to assemble the sequences. Results: The majority of viral sequences showed closest sequence identity to the Orthomyxoviridae family, although viruses similar to the Parvoviridae and Coronaviridae were also identified. Nearly complete sequences of five orthomyxoviral segments (HA, NP, PB1, PB2, and PA) were obtained and these showed an amino acid identity of 32–52% to known quaranjaviruses.

A restructuring of clinical services was necessary to accommodate mandatory changes while also maintaining the best possible standards for patient care. The present study explored the initial management, follow-up and patient-reported outcomes of burn injuries <15% total body surface area (TBSA) during the height of the COVID-19 lockdown at a tertiary burns centre. METHODS: A retrospective review of all adult patients with burns <15% TBSA during the national lockdown (23 March 2020 to 10 May 2020) was undertaken at The Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham (QEHB), UK. All referrals from non-QEHB telemedicine (external) or QEHB emergency (internal) departments were reviewed for management, length of hospital stay and pattern of follow-up (ward attender, self-care, community or outreach nurses). A telephone survey based on a structured questionnaire was conducted to establish patients’ satisfaction. RESULTS: A total of 84 burn patients were included in the study. The mean age was 39 years (age range = 19–91 years) and the male:female ratio was 4:1. Patients were managed non-operatively (n = 69, 82%) or operatively (n = 15, 18%). Patients attended the ward attender acute burns clinic only once (n = 36, 61%). The telephone survey captured 70% (n = 59) of the study population and 57 patients (97% of respondents) were pleased with the ongoing care and burn healing. CONCLUSION: The integration of patient led self-care, reduction in admissions, minimal clinics attendance and a telemedicine follow-up is an effective model for small burns management during the COVID-19 pandemic. A high degree of patient satisfaction was achieved with continuous and approachable communication channels with the burn multidisciplinary team. We continue to implement this effective model of burns management throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent period. LAY SUMMARY: The lockdown measures due to the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic affected the way we manage all medical emergencies including burns. The initial management, follow-up and patient satisfaction for small burn injuries during lockdown has not been reported previously. The aim of this study is to examine the outcome in terms of small burn management, hospital stay, number of clinic reviews, healing and patient satisfaction during the lockdown period in a burn centre in the UK. This would look at the need for operations and whether patients stayed longer if they required an intervention. We reviewed adult patients with small burns during the national lockdown (23 March 2020 to 10 May 2020) at The Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham (QEHB). All referrals from telemedicine, referral system (external) or QEHB (internal) were reviewed for management, length of hospital stay and pattern of follow-up. Patients were reviewed in the acute burns clinic and given advice for burn management and dressing for self-care. Follow-up was mostly via email (telemedicine) A telephone survey based on a structured questionnaire was conducted to find out patients’ satisfaction. Four times more men than women had small burns during the lockdown period. The average age was 39 years. The majority were managed conservatively with dressings (82%) and a small proportion required an operation (18%). Most patients attended the acute burns clinic only once (61%) for initial assessment and management. The telephone survey captured 70% of patient and 97% of respondents were pleased with the care and burn healing. The integration of patient-led self-care, reduction in admissions, minimal clinics attendance and a telemedicine follow-up is an effective model for burns management during the COVID-19 pandemic.

However, those community interventions are rarely examined within rigorous study designs. One strategy that holds the potential to reduce loneliness and can promote health and wellbeing is doing acts of kindness. The current study involves evaluating the impact of kindness acts on loneliness in community-dwelling individuals using an online social networking platform. METHODS: This study is made up of three randomised controlled trials conducted in three countries. Each randomised controlled trial has two arms (intervention vs waitlist control) and is designed to compare the effectiveness of the KIND challenge, which involves doing at least one act of kindness per week within a four-week period. This study will recruit users of an online community, be randomised online, and will be conducted using online assessments. We will first explore the effects of the intervention on the primary outcome of loneliness, followed by secondary outcomes, social isolation, neighbour relationship quality and contact, mental health symptoms, stress, quality of life, and positive affect. Further, we will assess the feasibility, acceptability, and safety of the KIND Challenge. DISCUSSION: This study, designed to evaluate the impact of kindness on the community, will be the first large scale randomised control trial conducted across three countries, Australia, UK, and USA. It will examine the potential of community-led interventions to reduce loneliness, improve social isolation, and promote neighbourhood cohesion, health, and wellbeing, which is especially crucial during the COVID-19 public health crisis.

All these viruses are seasonal and generate short-term immunity. Like the highly pathogenic coronaviruses, the endemic coronaviruses have zoonotic origins. Thus, understanding the evolutionary dynamics of these human viruses might provide insight into the future trajectories of SARS-CoV-2 evolution. Because the zoonotic sources of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E are known, we applied a population genetics–phylogenetic approach to investigate which selective events accompanied the divergence of these viruses from the animal ones. Results indicated that positive selection drove the evolution of some accessory proteins, as well as of the membrane proteins. However, the spike proteins of both viruses and the hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) of HCoV-OC43 represented the major selection targets. Specifically, for both viruses, most positively selected sites map to the receptor-binding domains (RBDs) and are polymorphic. Molecular dating for the HCoV-229E spike protein indicated that RBD Classes I, II, III, and IV emerged 3–9 years apart. However, since the appearance of Class V (with much higher binding affinity), around 25 years ago, limited genetic diversity accumulated in the RBD. These different time intervals are not fully consistent with the hypothesis that HCoV-229E spike evolution was driven by antigenic drift. An alternative, not mutually exclusive possibility is that strains with higher affinity for the cellular receptor have out-competed strains with lower affinity. The evolution of the HCoV-OC43 spike protein was also suggested to undergo antigenic drift. However, we also found abundant signals of positive selection in HE. Whereas such signals might result from antigenic drift, as well, previous data showing co-evolution of the spike protein with HE suggest that optimization for human cell infection also drove the evolution of this virus. These data provide insight into the possible trajectories of SARS-CoV-2 evolution, especially in case the virus should become endemic.","Forni, Diego; Cagliani, Rachele; Arrigoni, Federica; Benvenuti, Martino; Mozzi, Alessandra; Pozzoli, Uberto; Clerici, Mario; De Gioia, Luca; Sironi, Manuela",Virus Evol,4,3

The aim of the present study was to compare sleep patterns before and during COVID-19-related school lockdown, in a large sample of high school students. The present study is based a prospective, longitudinal survey on adolescent sleep health. Phase 1 was conducted in 2019, whereas phase 2 was conducted in 2020 (response rate 60.2%), during the last 10 days of a 60-day long school lockdown. Main outcomes comprised sleep parameters from the Munich ChronoType Questionnaire (MCTQ). A total of 2,022 students provided valid responses to MCTQ in both survey phases. Results showed later sleep timing on schooldays in 2020 compared to 2019 (36 min later bedtimes, Cohen's d = 0.56; 1:35 hr later rise times, Cohen's d = 1.44). Time spent in bed on schooldays increased from 8:20 to 9:19 hr (Cohen's d = 0.78), and sleep duration increased by 45 min (Cohen's d = 0.49). The proportion of adolescents obtaining the recommended ≥8 hr of sleep on schooldays increased from 13.4% (2019) to 37.5% during the lockdown. Social jetlag was reduced from 2:37 hr (2019) to 1:53 hr (2020, Cohen's d = 0.59). Results points to a potential advantageous effect of school lockdown in terms of increased school day sleep duration and reduced social jetlag. As sleep is important for mental and somatic health, it is conceivable that increased sleep duration offered some protection against harmful aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated social restrictions. Future studies should address possible associations between sleep changes and health during COVID-19-related school lockdown.","Saxvig, Ingvild West; Pallesen, Ståle; Sivertsen, Børge; Hysing, Mari; Evanger, Linn Nyjordet; Bjorvatn, Bjørn",Journal of sleep research,4,14

In response, we created authentic virtual clinical experiences in our Master of Genetic Counseling program, mimicking clinical practice: virtual simulation with standardized clients, and virtual clinical placements, including intake calls, triage, consultations, teamwork and time management, and genetic counseling with standardized clients. The virtual clinical experiences involved online pre‐brief, simulation, and debrief. We aimed to evaluate students’ satisfaction with this learning method. Between April and November 2020, we distributed an anonymous online survey to all participating students using a modified version of a validated satisfaction with simulation scale. We analyzed the combined responses from first‐ and second‐year virtual clinical experiences using descriptive statistics and content analysis. The total number of possible responses was 120. The mean response rate was 68.36% (n = 82.03), with a mean of 16.41 participants responding to each survey from each year group. Of the first‐year participants, 53% (n = 10) had not observed a genetic counseling consultation before attending the virtual clinical placement. Overall, 92.5% of responses indicated that students were satisfied with the virtual clinical experiences (SD = 0.05). 100% (n = 82) of responses indicated that working with standardized clients was beneficial to learning, encouraged reflection on clinical ability and was a valuable learning experience overall. However, 37.78% (n = 17) of those who participated in the virtual simulation found that the use of Zoom detracted from their clinical learning. The virtual clinical experiences increased first‐year students’ confidence about clinical placement and prepared second‐year students for telehealth. In conclusion, the adaptation to virtual clinical experiences enhanced learning for most students, prepared them for practice, met the requirements of the accreditation body and enabled all of our final year students to graduate on time.","Jacobs, Chris; McEwen, Alison",J Genet Couns,4,21

Sci.2018, 9, 956−97229732110) to the use of Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) cards to accelerate molecular dynamics simulations using polarizable many-body force fields. The new high-performance module allows for an efficient use of single- and multiple-GPU architectures ranging from research laboratories to modern supercomputer centers. After detailing an analysis of our general scalable strategy that relies on OpenACC and CUDA, we discuss the various capabilities of the package. Among them, the multiprecision possibilities of the code are discussed. If an efficient double precision implementation is provided to preserve the possibility of fast reference computations, we show that a lower precision arithmetic is preferred providing a similar accuracy for molecular dynamics while exhibiting superior performances. As Tinker-HP is mainly dedicated to accelerate simulations using new generation point dipole polarizable force field, we focus our study on the implementation of the AMOEBA model. Testing various NVIDIA platforms including 2080Ti, 3090, V100, and A100 cards, we provide illustrative benchmarks of the code for single- and multicards simulations on large biosystems encompassing up to millions of atoms. The new code strongly reduces time to solution and offers the best performances to date obtained using the AMOEBA polarizable force field. Perspectives toward the strong-scaling performance of our multinode massive parallelization strategy, unsupervised adaptive sampling and large scale applicability of the Tinker-HP code in biophysics are discussed.

Novel therapies are urgently needed. Janus kinase-inhibitors and Type I interferons have emerged as potential antiviral candidates for COVID-19 patients due to their proven efficacy against diseases with excessive cytokine release and their direct antiviral ability against viruses including coronaviruses, respectively. METHODS: A search of MEDLINE and MedRxiv was conducted by three investigators from inception until July 30th 2020 and included any study type that compared treatment outcomes of humans treated with Janus kinase-inhibitor or Type I interferon against controls. Inclusion necessitated data with clearly indicated risk estimates or those that permitted their back-calculation. Outcomes were synthesized using RevMan. RESULTS: Of 733 searched studies, we included four randomized and eleven non-randomized trials. Five of the studies were unpublished. Those who received Janus kinase-inhibitor had significantly reduced odds of mortality (OR, 0.12; 95% CI, 0.03–0.39, p< 0.001) and ICU admission (OR, 0.05; 95% CI, 0.01–0.26, p< 0.001), and had significantly increased odds of hospital discharge (OR, 22.76; 95% CI, 10.68–48.54, p< 0.00001) when compared to standard treatment group. Type I interferon recipients had significantly reduced odds of mortality (OR, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.04–0.85, p< 0.05), and increased odds of discharge bordering significance (OR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.00–3.59, p=0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Janus kinase-inhibitor treatment is significantly associated with positive clinical outcomes in terms of mortality, ICU admission, and discharge. Type I interferon treatment is associated with positive clinical outcomes in regard to mortality and discharge. While these data show promise, additional well-conducted RCTs are needed to further elucidate the relationship between clinical outcomes and Janus kinase-inhibitors and Type I interferons in COVID-19 patients.

The goal of these models is to account for rate variation among lineages, such that they are assumed to be adequate descriptions of the processes that generated the data. A common approach for selecting a clock model for a data set of interest is to examine a set of candidates and to select the model that provides the best statistical fit. However, this can lead to unreliable estimates if all the candidate models are actually inadequate. For this reason, a method of evaluating absolute model performance is critical. We describe a method that uses posterior predictive simulations to assess the adequacy of clock models. We test the power of this approach using simulated data and find that the method is sensitive to bias in the estimates of branch lengths, which tends to occur when using underparameterized clock models. We also compare the performance of the multinomial test statistic, originally developed to assess the adequacy of substitution models, but find that it has low power in identifying the adequacy of clock models. We illustrate the performance of our method using empirical data sets from coronaviruses, simian immunodeficiency virus, killer whales, and marine turtles. Our results indicate that methods of investigating model adequacy, including the one proposed here, should be routinely used in combination with traditional model selection in evolutionary studies. This will reveal whether a broader range of clock models to be considered in phylogenetic analysis.","Duchêne, David A.; Duchêne, Sebastian; Holmes, Edward C.; Ho, Simon Y.W.",Mol Biol Evol,4,20

Because India is a populous country, it is important for Indians to be aware of the basic modes of prevention that can diminish the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. AIM: The present questionnaire study was carried out among the undergraduate students to assess the awareness regarding the spread and control of COVID-19. METHODS: The questionnaire was circulated among the undergraduate students as a Google form. RESULTS: The study included responses of 868 undergraduate students belonging to 2 university colleges. The majority of the participants were females (63%; n = 547) in the age range of 18-23 y. Approximately 98.3% (853) had awareness regarding COVID-19. Approximately 94.7% (822) were washing their hands after visiting public places, out of which only 90.6% (786) were aware of proper steps to be followed in hand washing. It was concluded that it is required to create awareness among 20.8% (181) of our study participants regarding the importance of hand washing to control COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Awareness regarding COVID-19 among study participants was good. However, a small part of the study population is required to be educated on proper steps to be followed in hand washing.","Das, Deeksha; Shenoy, Ramya; Mukherjee, Megha; Unnikrishnan, Bhaskaran; Rungta, Nikita",Disaster medicine and public health preparedness,4,1

We implemented standardized, physiology-based, ICU admission criteria and analyzed the mortality rate of patients refused from the ICU. Materials and Methods: COVID-19 patients proposed for ICU admission were consecutively analyzed; Do-not-resuscitate patients were excluded. Patients presenting a SpO2 lower than 85% and/or dyspnea and/or mental confusion resulted eligible for ICU admission; patients not presenting these criteria remained in the ward. Primary outcome was both groups' survival rate. Secondary outcome was a sub analysis correlating SpO2 cutoff with ICU admission. Results: From March 2020 to January 2021, 1623 patients were admitted to our Center; 208 DNR patients were excluded; 97 patients underwent intensivist evaluation. The ICU-admitted group mortality rate resulted 15.9% at 28 days and 27% at 40 days; the ICU-refused group mortality rate resulted 0% at both intervals (p < 0.001). With a SpO2 cut-off of 92%, the hypoxia rate distribution did not correlate with ICU admission (p = 0.26); with a SpO2 cut-off of 85%, a correlation was found (p = 0.009). A similar correlation was also found with dyspnea (p =0.0002). Conclusion: In COVID-19 patients, standardized ICU admission criteria appeared to reduce safely ICU overload. In the absence of dyspnea and/or confusion, a SpO2 cutoff up to 85% for ICU admission was not burdened by negative outcomes. In a pandemic context, the SpO2 cutoff of 92%, as a threshold for ICU admission, needs critical re-evaluation.","Ceruti, S.; Glotta, A.; Biggiogero, M.; Maida, P.; Marzano, M.; Urso, P.; Garzoni, C.",,4,1

In many countries, this directive has been extended on shopping malls or public transportation. The aim of this paper is to critically analyze the statutory regulation to wear protective masks during the COVID-19 crisis from a medical standpoint. METHODS: We performed an extensive query of the most recent publications addressing the prevention of viral infections including the use of face masks in the community as a method to prevent the spread of the infection. We addressed the issues of practicability, professional use, and acceptability based on the community and the environment where the user resided. RESULTS: Upon our critical review of the available literature, we found only weak evidence for wearing a face mask as an efficient hygienic tool to prevent the spread of a viral infection. However, the use of MNC seems to be linked to relevant protection during close contact scenarios by limiting pathogen-containing aerosol and liquid droplet dissemination. Importantly, we found evidence for significant respiratory compromise in patients with severe obstructive pulmonary disease, secondary to the development of hypercapnia. This could also happen in patients with lung infections, with or without SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSION: Epidemiologists currently emphasize that wearing MNC will effectively interrupt airborne infections in the community. The government and the politicians have followed these recommendations and used them to both advise and, in some cases, mandate the general population to wear MNC in public locations. Overall, the results seem to suggest that there are some clinically relevant scenarios where the use of MNC necessitates more defined recommendations. Our critical evaluation of the literature both highlights the protective effects of certain types of face masks in defined risk groups, and emphasizes their potential risks.","Matuschek, Christiane; Moll, Friedrich; Fangerau, Heiner; Fischer, Johannes C.; Zänker, Kurt; van Griensven, Martijn; Schneider, Marion; Kindgen-Milles, Detlef; Knoefel, Wolfram Trudo; Lichtenberg, Artur; Tamaskovics, Balint; Djiepmo-Njanang, Freddy Joel; Budach, Wilfried; Corradini, Stefanie; Häussinger, Dieter; Feldt, Torsten; Jensen, Björn; Pelka, Rainer; Orth, Klaus; Peiper, Matthias; Grebe, Olaf; Maas, Kitti; Gerber, Peter Arne; Pedoto, Alessia; Bölke, Edwin; Haussmann, Jan",Eur J Med Res,4,2

This study aimed to describe the characteristics of HFC behaviors among Korean adults during indoor activities. METHODS: Thirty participants were enrolled in the study, and 2 hours of videotaped data were collected from each participant. Contact data were recorded by examining the frequency and duration of HFC on the videos. Three training sessions were conducted for 2 readers to ensure the accuracy and reliability of videotape reading. Re-reading and verification of selected video data were performed to confirm intrapersonal and interpersonal validity. Contact exposure (CE) was determined by multiplying the contact frequency (CF) by the contact duration (CD) to quantify the intensity of contact during the observation time (2 hours). RESULTS: A total of 3,007 HFCs (1,305 mucous membrane contacts and 1,702 non-mucous membrane contacts) were observed for 60 person-hours. The median CF (person/2 hr) of the mucous membranes (eye; 4.0, nose; 15.5, mouth; 16.5) was 39.5/person and the median total CD was 177.0 sec/person. The median CE (frequency-duration/sec/person) was 5,795.0 (mouth: 1,356.0, nose: 600.0, eye: 57.5). CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that the mouth and nose were the most frequent exposure sites for HFC. Avoiding habitual HFC, awareness of self-inoculation by HFC, and vigorous hand hygiene should be strengthened to prevent the spread of infections.","Oh, Hyang Soon; Ryu, Mikyung; Yang, Youngran",Epidemiol Health,4,16

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective study, we included 336 COVID-19 inpatients between February 15, 2020 and April 30, 2020 at the Taikang Tongji Hospital (Wuhan), China. Electronic medical records including patient demographics, laboratory results, and chest computed tomography (CT) images were reviewed. RESULTS: In total, 300 patients with complete clinical outcomes were included for analysis. The mean age was 65.3 years, and most patients were women (n = 167, 55.7%). Over 50% of patients presented with comorbidities, with hypertension (63.5%) being the most common comorbidity. After propensity score matching, results showed that men had significantly higher odds than premenopausal women for developing severe disease type (23.7% vs. 0%, OR 17.12, 95% CI 1.00–293.60; p = 0.003) and bilateral lung infiltration (86.1% vs. 64.7%, OR 3.39, 95% CI 1.08–10.64; p = 0.04), but not for mortality (2.0% vs. 0%, OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.04–19.12, p = 1.00). However, non-significant difference was observed among men and postmenopausal women in the percentage of severe disease type (32.7% vs. 41.7%, OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.37–1.24, p = 0.21), bilateral lung infiltration (86.1% vs. 91.7%, OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.22–1.47, p = 0.24), and mortality (2.0% vs. 6.0%, OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.06–1.69, p = 0.25).

Although the two groups of viruses differed markedly in the sequence of the spike protein, the gene (S) encoding this protein showed no evidence of positive selection or of an elevated mutation rate. Rather, the data suggested that recombination events have homogenized the portions of the genome other than the S gene between the two groups of viruses, while continuing to maintain the two distinct, anciently diverged versions of the S gene. The latter hypothesis was supported by a phylogeny of S proteins from representative coronaviruses, in which S proteins of AIBV and TCoV fell in the same clade.

This report examined how telecommuting is related to smoking behavior of wage and salary workers. METHODS: Self‐reported smoking behavior of 1,390 U.S. wage and salary workers aged 16–64 years from the Tobacco Use Supplement of the Current Population Survey 2018/19 were linked to the 2018 American Time Use Survey. Weighted multivariate logistic regression predicting smoking probability and generalized linear regression predicting smoking intensity were used for analysis. RESULTS: Almost a fifth (19%) of wage and salary workers reported working from home and over a half (52%) reported working in telecommuting amenable occupations. Nearly 12% were current smokers, smoking 14.7 cigarettes daily on average. Compared to their counterparts, smoking prevalence (percentage points) was lower among those employed in telecommuting amenable occupations (−0.52, p < .001 for all; 0.01, p = .862 for men; −2.40, p < .001 for women) and who worked more frequently from home (−0.21, p < .001 for all; −0.76, p < .001 for men; −0.03, p = .045 for women).

In the most severe cases this leads to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Due to respiratory failure associated with ARDS, the clinical intervention is the use of mechanical ventilation. Despite the benefits of mechanical ventilators, prolonged or misuse of these ventilators may lead to ventilation-associated/ventilation-induced lung injury (VILI). Damage caused to epithelial cells within the alveoli can lead to various types of complications and increased mortality rates. A key component of the immune response is recruitment of macrophages, immune cells that differentiate into phenotypes with unique pro- and/or anti-inflammatory roles based on the surrounding environment. An imbalance in pro- and anti-inflammatory responses can have deleterious effects on the individual’s health. To gain a greater understanding of the mechanisms of the immune response to VILI and post-ventilation outcomes, we develop a mathematical model of interactions between the immune system and site of damage while accounting for macrophage polarization. Through Latin hypercube sampling we generate a virtual cohort of patients with biologically feasible dynamics. We use a variety of methods to analyze the results, including a random forest decision tree algorithm and parameter sensitivity with eFAST. Analysis shows that parameters and properties of transients related to epithelial repair and M1 activation and de-activation best predicted outcome. Using this new information, we hypothesize inter-ventions and use these treatment strategies to modulate damage in select virtual cases.","Minucci, Sarah; Heise, Rebecca L.; Valentine, Michael S.; Kamga Gninzeko, Franck J.; Reynolds, Angela M.",bioRxiv,4,17

As many in-person mental health support services have been suspended or transitioned online to facilitate physical distancing, there have been numerous calls for the rapid expansion of asynchronous virtual mental health (AVMH) resources. These AVMH resources have great potential to provide support for people coping with negative mental health impacts associated with the pandemic; however, literature examining use prior to COVID-19 illustrates that the uptake of these resources is consistently low. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper is to examine the use of AVMH resources in Canada during the COVID-19 pandemic among the general population and among a participant subgroup classified as experiencing an adverse mental health impact related to the pandemic.

Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the sample, and bivariate cross-tabulations were used to examine the relationships between the use of AVMH resources and self-reported indicators of mental health that included a range of emotional and coping-related responses to the pandemic. Univariate and fully adjusted multivariate logistic regression models were used to examine associations between sociodemographic and health-related characteristics and use of AVMH resources in the subgroup of participants who reported experiencing one or more adverse mental health impacts identified in the set of self-reported mental health indicators. RESULTS: Among the total sample, 2.0% (n=59) of participants reported accessing AVMH resources in the prior 2 weeks to cope with stress related to the COVID-19 pandemic, with the highest rates of use among individuals who reported self-harm (n=5, 10.4%) and those who reported coping “not well” with COVID-19–related stress (n=22, 5.5%). Within the subgroup of 1954 participants (65.1% of the total sample) who reported an adverse mental health impact related to COVID-19, 54 (2.8%) reported use of AVMH resources. Individuals were more likely to have used AVMH resources if they had reported receiving in-person mental health supports, were connecting virtually with a mental health worker or counselor, or belonged to a visible minority group. CONCLUSIONS: Despite substantial government investment into AVMH resources, uptake is low among both the general population and individuals who may benefit from the use of these resources as a means of coping with the adverse mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Further research is needed to improve our understanding of the barriers to use.","Richardson, Chris G; Slemon, Allie; Gadermann, Anne; McAuliffe, Corey; Thomson, Kimberly; Daly, Zachary; Salway, Travis; Currie, Leanne M; David, Anita; Jenkins, Emily",J Med Internet Res,4,20

Improved access to early imaging and better clinical scoring algorithms have resulted in less negative appendicectomy rates. In addition, non-operative management has become increasingly utilized. The aim of this study was to assess the variability of management of acute appendicitis globally. METHODS: This was a multi-national targeted survey of general surgeons across 39 countries. A structured set of questions was utilized to delineate nuances between management styles of consultants and trainees. Opinions on the pathological diagnosis of appendicitis, acceptable negative appendicectomy rates, and the role of non-operative treatment of appendicitis (NOTA) were surveyed. RESULTS: A total of 304 general surgeons responded to this survey, 42% of which were consultants/attendings. Sixty-nine percent advocated that a histologically normal appendix was the most appropriate definition of a negative appendicectomy, while 29% felt that anything other than inflammation, necrosis, gangrene, or perforation was more appropriate. Forty-three percent felt that negative appendicectomy rates should be less than 10%, with 41% reporting that their own negative appendicectomy rate was < 5%. Interestingly, only 17% reported routinely using NOTA for uncomplicated appendicitis, with one-fifth stating that they would undergo NOTA if they themselves had uncomplicated appendicitis. CONCLUSION: This study represents the largest sampling of management strategies for acute appendicitis. It shows substantial global heterogeneity between clinicians regarding what constitutes a negative appendicectomy as well as the appropriateness of non-operative management.","Boland, Patrick Anthony; Donlon, Noel E.; Kelly, Michael E.; Nugent, Timothy; Free, Ross; Waters, Peadar; Neary, Peter; Rausa, Emanuele; Proud, David; Donohoe, Claire L.; Barry, Kevin M.; Reynolds, John V.",Ir J Med Sci,4,0

Since 1985, commercial firms have initiated clinical studies involving a total of 28 mAbs. To date, one product (palivizumab) has been approved and eight candidates are currently in clinical study. Most commercial mAbs studied as antiviral agents in the clinic have either directly or indirectly targeted human immunodeficiency virus, respiratory syncytial virus, or hepatitis C virus infections. However, the ability of mAbs to bind to specific targets and utilize various anti-infective modes of action would seem to make them well suited for the prevention and/or treatment of a wider variety of viral diseases. A number of factors, including the continuing need for innovative medicines for viral infections, the global spread of viral infections, and increased government funding for the study of pathogen countermeasures, have prompted companies to reconsider mAbs as antiviral agents. Public sector research into the use of mAbs against emerging pathogens, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, may have already provided candidates for further development.","Reichert, Janice M.",BioDrugs,4,30

In this sense, understanding which residue plays what role in the interaction between SARS‐CoV‐2 spike glycoprotein and ACE2 from cats, dogs, and ferrets is an important guide for helping to choose which animal model can be used to study the pathology of COVID‐19, and if there are differences between these interactions and those occurring in the human system. To help answer these questions, we performed classical molecular dynamics simulations to evaluate, from an atomistic point of view, the interactions in these systems. Our results show that there are significant differences in the interacting residues between the systems from different animal species, and the role of ACE2 key residues are different in each system, and can assist in the search for different inhibitors for each animal.","Soté, William O.; Franca, Eduardo F.; Hora, Aline S.; Comar, Moacyr",Transbound Emerg Dis,4,16

These events can often be managed at home with oral analgesics, but if the pain is not controlled or the patient develops other associated problems, they seek care in an emergency department (ED). In the ED, they receive initial treatment with pain medications and are assessed for other complications such as infection and acute chest syndrome. If an individual's pain is not controlled in a short period of time, the majority of these patients are admitted to the hospital for inpatient management or placed in an observation unit (OBs) for 6-47 hours. The COVID-19 pandemic affected the Greater Newark community starting in mid March with the majority of all inpatient admissions (Ads) being COVID related through the end of May. It has been observed both at our medical center and nationally that during this time period and even afterwards, the number of ED visits and Ads had significantly fallen. The reasons for this finding may include fear of contracting COVID infection at the hospital, regular telemedicine (TM) calls to facilitate outpatient management, and an increase in the number of prescriptions of home pain medications. The purpose of this analysis was to examine patterns of ED visits, Ads, outpatient visits, prescription renewals and nurse (RN) and social worker (MSW) calls in order to determine the impact of COVID-19 infection on the local SCD community. Methodology: A retrospective review was undertaken of billing data and the EMR of all patients with SCD treated at Newark Beth Israel Medical Center (a 450 bed community-based academic tertiary care medical center) between January 2020 and June 2020. Data collected included the number of and reason for ED and OBs, Ads, the number of TM and outpatient visits, and MSW and RN telephone contacts. All patients 18 years of age and older were included. Overall, 100 adults with SCD received care between January and June. Results: Peak hospital COVID Ads, ED and OBs for all patients (SCD and non-SCD) occurred during the weeks between March 25 and May 24, 2020 with a daily inpatient census over 200 between April 7 and 24. SCD Ads at peak COVID (April-May) were significantly lower at 26±2/month compared to 64±11/month pre-COVID (January-February) (p= 0.04). ED and OBs were unchanged. During the peak of COVID, 10/93 (11%) SCD Ads (1 death) were COVID related with 80/96 (86%) for uncomplicated pain crises. MSW and RN called all patients proactively to offer support at onset of COVID pandemic. During this same time period, the number of MSW telephone contacts increased from 138±37/month pre-COVID to 372±21/month during COVID (p=0.02). RN contacts with SCD patients were stable and mostly were for pain prescription renewals. TM was initiated in March 2020 and an increase in these visits correlated with a fall in face to face physician visits: 83.5±11/month pre-COVID to 39.5±8/month peak COVID (p= 0.04), and TM 0/month pre-COVID and 31±4/month peak COVID (0.01). Conclusion: The outbreak of COVID-19 in the community reduced the number of Ads for patients with SCD without an increase in ED and OBs visits. MD face-to-face encounters were reduced but outpatient care continued with the initiation of TM, regular RN contact with maintenance of pain medication prescriptions and a greater numbers of MSW calls for psychosocial support. Further investigation and understanding of the use of Ads for SCD care, and the reduction during COVID, may have implications for current SCD management.

Here we have discussed about the spread of COVID-2019 epidemic in great detail using Euler method. The Euler method is a method of solution of ordinary differential equations. The SIR model has the combination of three ordinary differential equations. In this study, we have used the data of COVID-2019 Outbreak of India on 8th May, 2020. In this data, we have used 135710 susceptible cases, 54340 infectious cases and 1830 reward or removed cases for the initial level of experimental purpose. Data about a wide variety of infectious diseases has been analyzed with the help of SIR model. Therefore, this model has already been well tested for infectious diseases. Using the data on the number of COVID-2019 outbreak cases in India, the results obtained from the analysis and simulation of the proposed model show that the COVID-2019 epidemic cases increase for some time and thereafter this outbreak will decrease. The results obtained from the SIR model also suggest that the Euler method can be used to predict transmission and prevent the COVID-2019 epidemic in India. Finally, from this study, we have found that the outbreak of COVID-2019 epidemic in India will be at its peak on 25 May 2020 and after that it will work slowly and on the verge of ending in the first or second week of August 2020.","Yadav, D.

Despite tremendous efforts and resources spent worldwide trying to explore antiviral drugs, there is still no effective clinical treatment for COVID-19 to date. Approximately 15% of COVID-19 cases progress to pneumonia, and patients with severe pneumonia may die from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). It is believed that pulmonary fibrosis from SARS-CoV-2 infection further leads to ARDS, often resulting in irreversible impairment of lung function. If the mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 infection primarily causes an immune response or immune cell infiltration can be identified, it may be possible to mitigate excessive immune responses by modulating the infiltration and activation of specific targets, thereby reducing or preventing severe lung damage. However, the extent to which immune cell subsets are significantly altered in the lung tissues of COVID-19 patients remains to be elucidated. This study applied the CIBERSORT-X method to comprehensively evaluate the transcriptional estimated immune infiltration landscape in the lung tissues of COVID-19 patients and further compare it with the lung tissues of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). We found a variety of immune cell subtypes in the COVID-19 group, especially naïve B cells were highly infiltrated. Comparison of functional transcriptomic analyses revealed that non-differentiated naïve B cells may be the main cause of the over-active humoral immune response. Using several publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing data to validate the genetic differences in B-cell populations, it was found that the B-cells collected from COVID-19 patients were inclined towards naïve B-cells, whereas those collected from IPF patients were inclined towards memory B-cells. Further differentiation of B cells between COVID-19 mild and severe patients showed that B cells from severe patients tended to be antibody-secreting cells, and gene expression showed that B cells from severe patients were similar to DN2 B cells that trigger extrafollicular response. Moreover, a higher percentage of B-cell infiltration seems associated with poorer clinical outcome. Finally, a comparison of several specific COVID-19 cases treated with targeted B-cell therapy suggests that appropriate suppression of naïve B cells might potentially be a novel strategy to alleviate the severe symptoms of COVID-19.","Wu, Yi-Ying; Wang, Sheng-Huei; Wu, Chih-Hsien; Yen, Li-Chen; Lai, Hsing-Fan; Ho, Ching-Liang; Chiu, Yi-Lin",PLoS One,4,0

PsychINFO, CINAHL and PubMed were searched for papers published in English from 2010 to 2020, and 46 papers were reviewed. Most papers recommended having multiple mentors and many recommended assessing baseline research skills. Barriers and facilitators were both individual and institutional. Individual barriers mentioned most frequently were a lack of time and finding work–life balance. UMF mentioned barriers related to bias, discrimination and isolation. Institutional barriers included lack of mentors, lack of access to resources, and heavy teaching and service loads. UMF experienced institutional barriers such as devaluation of experience or expertise. Individual facilitators were subdivided and included writing and synthesis as technical skills, networking and collaborating as interpersonal skills, and accountability, leadership, time management, and resilience/grit as personal skills. Institutional facilitators included access to mentoring, professional development opportunities, and workload assigned to research.

The present study investigated the effect of magnesium (Mg) and vitamin C (VC) supplementation for preventing steroid-associated osteonecrosis (SAON) in a rat experimental model. In SAON rats, 50 mg/kg Mg, or 100 mg/kg VC, or combination, or water control was orally supplemented daily for 2 or 6 weeks respectively. Osteonecrosis was evaluated by histology. Serum Mg, VC, and bone turnover markers were measured. Microfil-perfused samples prepared for angiography and trabecular architecture were evaluated by micro-CT. Primary bone marrow cells were isolated from each group to evaluate their potentials in osteoblastogenesis and osteoclastogenesis. The mechanisms were tested in vitro. Histological evaluation showed SAON lesions in steroid treated groups. Mg and VC supplementation synergistically reduced the apoptosis of osteocytes and osteoclast number, and increased osteoblast surface. VC supplementation significantly increased the bone formation marker PINP, and the combination significantly decreased the bone resorption marker CTX. TNFα expression and oxidative injury were decreased in bone marrow in Mg/VC/combination group. Mg significantly increased the blood perfusion in proximal tibia and decreased the leakage particles in distal tibia 2 weeks after SAON induction. VC significantly elevated the osteoblast differentiation potential of marrow cells and improved the trabecular architecture. The combination supplementation significantly inhibited osteoclast differentiation potential of marrow cells. In vitro study showed promoting osteoblast differentiation effect of VC, and anti-inflammation and promoting angiogenesis effect of Mg with underlying mechanisms. Mg and VC supplementation could synergistically alleviate SAON in rats, indicating great translational potentials of metallic minerals for preventing SAON.","Zheng, Li-Zhen; Wang, Jia-Li; Xu, Jian-Kun; Zhang, Xiao-Tian; Liu, Bao-Yi; Huang, Le; Zhang, Ri; Zu, Hai-Yue; He, Xuan; Mi, Jie; Pang, Qian-Qian; Wang, Xin-Luan; Ruan, Ye-Chun; Zhao, De-Wei; Qin, Ling",Biomaterials,4,23

METHODS: Surviving SARS patients were seen at least twice within 3 months after discharge and underwent SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) IgG antibody testing, pulmonary function testing, and chest radiography and/or high-resolution CT (HRCT) examinations at Chinese PLA General Hospital. The treatments received at Xiaotangshan Hospital were analyzed retrospectively and were correlated to later status. RESULTS: Positive SARS-Co virus IgG antibody results were seen in 208 of 258 patients, with 21.3% (55 of 258 patients) still having a pulmonary diffusion abnormality (Dlco < 80% of predicted). By comparing the 155 survivors with positive SARS-CoV IgG antibody results and Dlco ≥ 80% predicted with the 50 patients with negative SARS-CoV IgG results, we found that 53 patients with positive SARS-CoV IgG results and a lung diffusion abnormality had endured a much longer course of fever and received larger doses of glucocorticoid, as well as higher ratios of oxygen inhalation and noninvasive ventilation treatment. For these patients, 51 of 53 patients with positive SARS-CoV IgG results and a lung diffusion abnormality underwent pulmonary function testing after approximately 1 month. Dlco improved in 80.4% of patients (41 of 51 patients). Of the patients with a lung diffusion abnormality, 40 of 51 patients showed lung fibrotic changes in the lung image examination and 22 patients (55%) showed improvement in lung fibrotic changes 1 month later. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that lung fibrotic changes caused by SARS disease occurred mostly in severely sick patients and may be self-rehabilitated. Dlco scores might be more sensitive than HRCT when evaluating lung fibrotic changes.","Xie, Lixin; Liu, Youning; Xiao, Yueyong; Tian, Qing; Fan, Baoxing; Zhao, Hong; Chen, Weijun",Chest,4,1

This article examines who requests accommodations and who is more likely to have requests granted. We investigate the roles of individual characteristics and their intersection, including disability, sexual orientation, gender, race/ethnicity, and age. Methods: Using data from a national survey of U.S. lawyers, we estimate the odds of requesting accommodations and having the requests approved. We also estimate differences in odds according to individual characteristics, adjusting for control variables. Results: Personal identity factors, such as disability status, gender, and age, predict requests for accommodations. Odds of requesting accommodations were higher for women and people with disabilities as compared to men and those without disabilities, but lower for older individuals. Odds of requesting accommodations were higher for an older population segment—older lesbian, gay, bisexual, and queer (LGBQ) lawyers—than for younger lawyers. Accommodations were granted differentially to individuals with multiple marginalized identities. Counter to predictions, being a person with a disability is negatively associated with having an accommodation granted. Older lawyers generally have higher odds of having accommodations granted, but odds for groups such as women and racial/ethnic minorities decline with age. LGBQ lawyers who are racial minorities have lower odds than White LGBQ lawyers of having their accommodations granted. Longer tenure increases the odds of requesting accommodations. Working for a private organization decreases the odds; working for a large organization generally increases the odds. Conclusions: Those most needing accommodations, such as lawyers with disabilities and women, are more likely to request accommodations. Disabled lawyers, older women lawyers, older racial/ethnic minority lawyers, and LGBQ minority lawyers have relatively low odds of having requests granted. The results highlight the need to consider intersectional identities in the accommodation process.","Blanck, Peter; Hyseni, Fitore; Altunkol Wise, Fatma",J Occup Rehabil,4,29

Expectedly, the situation has elicited social and medical responses from the public and governments respectively. Nigeria recorded an imported case from Italy on February 27, 2020. Hence, this paper assesses the early socio-medical response to COVID-19 in Nigeria within the first 100 days after the index case. The paper employs analytical methods and collates data from various media reports and official sources. Findings The incidence of COVID-19 grows steadily in Nigeria, moving from an imported case and elitist pattern to community transmission. The case fatality stood at 2.8%. The country recorded an upsurge (52% of total cases) in the transmission of COVID-19 during the short period the lockdown was relaxed. The paper presents a concise response framework to highlight some specific multisectoral responses to the pandemic. A combination of social and medical responses help Nigeria to curtail the spread of the virus to a large extent. Conclusion The potential of overwhelming COVID-19 is still imminent in Nigeria as the country is attempting to hurriedly open the economy, which could sacrifice public health gains for temporary economic gains.","Amzat, Jimoh; Aminu, Kafayat; Kolo, Victor I.; Akinyele, Adenike A.; Ogundairo, Janet A.; Danjibo, Chidinma M.",Int J Infect Dis,4,20

These devices, while inexpensive, have not been adequately studied for their ability to resist biofouling and biofilm buildup. Bacterial biofilms are a major cause of biofouling in the medical field and, therefore, hospital-acquired, and medical device infections. These surface-attached bacteria are highly recalcitrant to conventional antimicrobial agents and result in chronic infections. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and medical officials have considered 3D printed medical devices as alternatives to conventional devices, due to manufacturing shortages. This abundant use of 3D printed devices in the medical fields warrants studies to assess the ability of different microorganisms to attach and colonize to such surfaces. In this study, we describe methods to determine bacterial biofouling and biofilm formation on 3D printed materials. We explored the biofilm-forming ability of multiple opportunistic pathogens commonly found on the human body including Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus to colonize eight commonly used polylactic acid (PLA) polymers. Biofilm quantification, surface topography, digital optical microscopy, and 3D projections were employed to better understand the bacterial attachment to 3D printed surfaces. We found that biofilm formation depends on surface structure, hydrophobicity, and that there was a wide range of antimicrobial properties among the tested polymers. We compared our tested materials with commercially available antimicrobial PLA polymers.","Hall, Donald C.; Palmer, Phillip; Ji, Hai-Feng; Ehrlich, Garth D.; Król, Jarosław E.",Front Microbiol,4,24

Studies demonstrated that severe forms of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have occurred in elderly patients and patients with co-morbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases. Objective This study investigated the impact of obesity on COVID-19 severity, irrespective of other individual factors. Methods This retrospective observational study included all adult patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection, who were admitted to Sheikh Khalifa Ibn Zaid International University Hospital between March 20 and May 10, 2020. First, we compared patients with and those without obesity in terms of demographic characteristics, co-morbidities, clinical symptoms, and outcomes. Further, using logistic regression models, we analyzed the association between obesity and intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Also, we examined whether the association between obesity and ICU admission was also consistent among overweight patients. Results The study population included 107 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection. Obese patients have been admitted in ICU more than patients without obesity (P-value = 0.035). While adjusting for other risk factors for ICU admission, we found that obesity was an independent risk factor for ICU admission (OR = 5.04, 95% CI (1.14-22.37)). When we examined the association of both obesity and overweight with ICU admission, we found that only obesity was significantly associated with ICU admission (OR = 9.11, 95% CI (1.49-55.84)). Conclusion Our study found that obesity was strongly associated with severity of COVID-19. The risk of ICU admission is greater in the presence of obesity. Physicians should be awarded to the need of specific and early management of obese patients with COVID-19 disease.","Motaib, Imane; Zbiri, Saad; Elamari, Saloua; Dini, Nezha; Chadli, Asma; El Kettani, Chafik",Cureus,4,28

This was followed by a period of convalescence and SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal swab negativity. As a consequence of prolonged immunosuppression, the patient developed pneumocystis pneumonia. CONCLUSION: This case highlights the role of antibodies in clearing SARS-CoV-2 in a hypogammaglobulinaemic host and demonstrates the consequences of prolonged immunosuppression and delayed treatment. We propose that this may be of particular significance given the capacity of SARS-CoV-2 to develop advantageous mutations in a chronically infected host.","Nguyen, Hanna; Salkeld, Jo; Agarwal, Sangita; Goodman, Anna",Clin Infect Pract,4,3

In four cross-sectional mixed-methods data collections conducted between December 2020 and March 2021 (n = 4,026), we showed that a majority of subjects were willing to test despite mistrust and ignorance regarding rapid tests’ validity. Experimental evidence shows that low costs and access to events could increase testing intentions. Mandatory reporting and isolation after positive results were not identified as major barriers. Instead, assuming that testing and isolation can slow down the pandemic and the possibility to protect others were related to greater willingness to get tested. While we did not find evidence for risk compensation for past tests, experimental evidence suggests that there is a tendency to show less mask wearing and physical distancing in a group of tested individuals. A short communication intervention reduced complacent behavior. The derived recommendations could make rapid testing a successful pillar of pandemic management.","Betsch, Cornelia; Sprengholz, Philipp; Siegers, Regina; Eitze, Sarah; Korn, Lars; Goldhahn, Laura; Schmitz, Jule Marie; Giesler, Paula; Knauer, Gesine; Jenny, Mirjam A.",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,4,27

MCs have been reported as heterogeneous population morphologically and functionally. However, the transcriptional heterogeneity of MCs was rarely studied. In this study, we illustrated the transcriptional heterogeneity of MCs with different perspectives by using publicly available single-cell dataset GSE109774. Specifically, MCs are transcriptionally different from other cell types, and ligand-receptor interactions of different cells with MCs vary. Re-clustering of MCs identified five distinct subclusters. The heterogeneity of MCs in tissues was reflected by MC coverage, various distribution of MC subclusters, and ligand-receptor interactions of MCs and parenchymal cells. The transcriptomic diversity of MCs revealed in this article will help facilitate further research into MCs.

However, relatively little is known about the ferret immune system, due in part to a paucity of ferret‐reactive reagents. In particular, T follicular helper (Tfh) cells are critical in the generation of effective humoral responses in humans, mice and other animal models but to date it has not been possible to identify Tfh in ferrets. Here, we describe the screening and development of ferret-reactive BCL6, CXCR5 and PD-1 monoclonal antibodies. We found two commercial anti-BCL6 antibodies (clone K112-91 and clone IG191E/A8) had cross-reactivity with lymph node cells from influenza-infected ferrets. We next developed two murine monoclonal antibodies against ferret CXCR5 (clone feX5-C05) and PD-1 (clone fePD-CL1) using a single B cell PCR-based method. We were able to clearly identify Tfh cells in lymph nodes from influenza infected ferrets using these antibodies. The development of ferret Tfh marker antibodies and the identification of ferret Tfh cells will assist the evaluation of vaccine-induced Tfh responses in the ferret model and the design of novel vaccines against the infection of influenza and other viruses, including SARS-CoV2.","Jiang, Wenbo; Wong, Julius; Tan, Hyon-Xhi; Kelly, Hannah G.; Whitney, Paul G.; Barr, Ian; Layton, Daniel S.; Kent, Stephen J.; Wheatley, Adam K.; Juno, Jennifer A.",Sci Rep,4,24

A feline coronavirus antiviral drug, GC376, has been shown to be effective in inhibiting the SARS-CoV-2 main protease and live virus growth. As this drug moves into clinical trials, further characterization of GC376 with the main protease of coronaviruses is required to gain insight into the drug’s properties, such as reversibility and broad specificity. Reversibility is an important factor for therapeutic proteolytic inhibitors to prevent toxicity due to off-target effects. Here we demonstrate that GC376 has nanomolar Ki values with the Mpro from both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV strains. Restoring enzymatic activity after inhibition by GC376 demonstrates reversible binding with both proteases. In addition, the stability and thermodynamic parameters of both proteases were studied to shed light on physical chemical properties of these viral enzymes, revealing higher stability for SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. The comparison of a new X-ray crystal structure of Mpro from SARS-CoV complexed with GC376 reveals similar molecular mechanism of inhibition compared to SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, and gives insight into the broad specificity properties of this drug. In both structures, we observe domain swapping of the N-termini in the dimer of the Mpro, which facilitates coordination of the drug’s P1 position. These results validate that GC376 is a drug with an off-rate suitable for clinical trials.","Arutyunova, Elena; Bashir Khan, Muhammad; Fischer, Conrad; Lu, Jimmy; Lamer, Tess; Vuong, Wayne; van Belkum, Marco J.; McKay, Ryan T.; Lorne Tyrrell, D.; Vederas, John C.; Young, Howard S.; Joanne Lemieux, M.",J Mol Biol,4,28

Emergence of the delta variant of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been associated with increased incidences of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) among unvaccinated and vaccinated persons. This exploratory analysis evaluated the incidence and genetic sequences of Covid-19 cases in the ongoing COVE trial during the open-label phase from July-August 2021, when delta-variants surged in the US. Methods: Covid-19 cases identified between July 1, 2021-Aug 27, 2021 in participants initially randomized to mRNA-1273 (vaccinated from July-December 2020) and those initially randomized to the placebo (vaccinated December 2020-April 2021) who received at least one dose and were SARS-CoV-2-negative at baseline in the modified-intent-to treat population were analyzed. Included were Covid-19 cases occurring after 26-Mar-2021 with positive RT-PCR results in nasopharyngeal samples (central lab test) and reported Covid-19 symptoms. Genetic sequencing of Covid-19 cases was also performed. Results: There were 14,746 participants in the earlier mRNA-1273 (mRNA-1273e) group and 11,431 in the later placebo-mRNA1273 (mRNA-1273p) group. Covid-19 cases increased from the start of the open-label phase to July-August 2021. During July and August, 162 Covid-19 cases occurred in the mRNA-1273e group and 88 in the mRNA-1273p group. Of the cases sequenced, 144/149 [97.0%]) in the mRNA-1273 and 86/88 (99%) in the mRNA-1273p groups were attributed to delta. The incidence rate of Covid-19 was lower for the mRNA-1273p (49.0/1000 person-years) versus mRNA-1273e (77.1/1000 person-years) group with a 36.4% (95% CI 17.1%-51.5%) reduction in the observed incidence rates. There were fewer severe Covid-19 cases in the mRNA-1273p (6; 6.2/1000 person-years) than mRNA-1273e (13; 3.3/1000 person-years) groups with an estimated 46.0% (95% CI -52.4%-83.2%) reduction of the observed incidence rate for later versus earlier vaccinations during July-August. Three Covid-19 related hospitalizations occurred with two resulting deaths in the mRNA-1273e group. Conclusion: Incidence rates of Covid-19 and severe Covid-19 were lower during the months when delta was the dominant variant (July/August 2021) among COVE participants vaccinated more recently. Analysis of COVID-19 cases from the open-label phase of the COVE study is ongoing.","Baden, L. R.; ElSahly, H. M.; Essink, B.; Follman, D.; Neuzil, K.

In this study, we explored associations between salivary cortisol as a potential biomarker for stress and depressive symptoms and several self-completed psychological measurement scales among pregnant women. In total, 652 pregnant women participating in the PRegnancy and Infant DEvelopment (PRIDE) Study completed the Edinburgh Depression Scale (EDS), Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2), Pregnancy-Related Anxiety Questionnaire-Revised (PRAQ-R), and Tilburg Pregnancy Distress Scale (TPDS) and collected a single awakening salivary cortisol sample around gestational week 17. Odds ratios, Spearman’s correlation coefficients (ρ(s)) and Cohen’s Kappa coefficients (κ) were calculated to examine the associations between the EDS, PHQ-2, PRAQ-R, TPDS, and maternal cortisol levels. The overall correlation coefficient between the score on the EDS and the salivary cortisol level was 0.01 (p = 0.89) with κ = -0.01 (95% confidence interval [CI] -0.08–0.06). We did not observe agreement between the PHQ-2 and cortisol levels either (κ = 0.06 (95% CI -0.02–0.14)). The results for the PRAQ-R and TPDS were similar with overall correlations with maternal cortisol levels of ρ(s) = 0.01 (p = 0.81) and ρ(s) = 0.06 (p = 0.35) and agreements of κ = 0.02 (95% CI -0.06–0.09) and κ = -0.02 (95% CI -0.11–0.07), respectively.

Activation of the renin‐angiotensin‐aldosterone system (RAAS) contributes to avid sodium retention, cardiac hypertrophy and oedema formation, including lung congestion. While the status of the classic components of RAAS such as renin, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), angiotensin II (Ang II) and angiotensin II receptor AT‐1 is well studied in CHF, the expression of angiotensin converting enzyme‐2 (ACE2), a key enzyme of angiotensin 1‐7 (Ang 1‐7) generation in the pulmonary, cardiac and renal systems has not been studied thoroughly in this clinical setting. This issue is of a special interest as Ang 1‐7 counterbalance the vasoconstrictory, pro‐inflammatory and pro‐proliferative actions of Ang II. Furthermore, CHF predisposes to COVID‐19 disease severity, while ACE2 also serves as the binding domain of SARS‐CoV‐2 in human host‐cells, and acts in concert with furin, an important enzyme in the synthesis of BNP in CHF, in permeating viral functionality along TMPRSST2. ADAM17 governs ACE2 shedding from cell membranes. Therefore, the present study was designed to investigate the expression of ACE2, furin, TMPRSS2 and ADAM17 in the lung, heart and kidneys of rats with CHF to understand the exaggerated susceptibility of clinical CHF to COVID‐19 disease. Heart failure was induced in male Sprague Dawley rats by the creation of a surgical aorto‐caval fistula. Sham‐operated rats served as controls. One week after surgery, the animals were subdivided into compensated and decompensated CHF according to urinary sodium excretion. Both groups and their controls were sacrificed, and their hearts, lungs and kidneys were harvested for assessment of tissue remodelling and ACE2, furin, TMPRSS2 and ADAM17 immunoreactivity, expression and immunohistochemical staining. ACE2 immunoreactivity and mRNA levels increased in pulmonary, cardiac and renal tissues of compensated, but not in decompensated CHF. Furin immunoreactivity was increased in both compensated and decompensated CHF in the pulmonary, cardiac tissues and renal cortex but not in the medulla. Interestingly, both the expression and abundance of pulmonary, cardiac and renal TMPRSS2 decreased in CHF in correlation with the severity of the disease. Pulmonary, cardiac and renal ADAM17 mRNA levels were also downregulated in decompensated CHF. Circulating furin levels increased in proportion to CHF severity, whereas plasma ACE2 remained unchanged. In summary, ACE2 and furin are overexpressed in the pulmonary, cardiac and renal tissues of compensated and to a lesser extent of decompensated CHF as compared with their sham controls. The increased expression of the ACE2 in heart failure may serve as a compensatory mechanism, counterbalancing the over‐activity of the deleterious isoform, ACE. Downregulated ADAM17 might enhance membranal ACE2 in COVID‐19 disease, whereas the suppression of TMPRSS2 in CHF argues against its involvement in the exaggerated susceptibility of CHF patients to SARS‐CoV2.","Khoury, Emad E.; Knaney, Yara; Fokra, Ahmad; Kinaneh, Safa; Azzam, Zaher; Heyman, Samuel N.; Abassi, Zaid",J Cell Mol Med,4,30
