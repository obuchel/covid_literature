123515,Otolaryngologists' Role in Redeployment During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Commentary.,2020-05-05,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS Ustekinumab is approved for the treatment of Crohn's disease (CD). Systematically registered prospective real-world data is scarce. We therefore aimed to study the effectiveness, safety and usage of ustekinumab for CD in everyday practise. METHODS We prospectively enrolled CD patients initiating ustekinumab in regular care between December 2016 and January 2019. Clinical (Harvey Bradshaw Index (HBI)), biochemical (C-reactive protein (CRP) and faecal calprotectin (FCP)), extra-intestinal manifestations, and peri-anal fistula activity, ustekinumab dosage, concomitant medication use, and adverse events were documented at week 0, 12, 24, and 52. The primary outcome was corticosteroid-free clinical remission. RESULTS In total, 221 CD patients were included (98.6% anti-TNF and 46.6% vedolizumab exposed) with a median follow-up of 52.0 weeks (IQR 49.3-58.4). The corticosteroid-free clinical remission rates at week 24 and 52 was 38.2% and 37.1%, respectively. An initial dosing schedule of 8 weeks, compared to 12 weeks, correlated with a lower discontinuation rate (20.0% vs. 42.6%, p=0.01), but comparable corticosteroid-free clinical remission at week 52 (46.3% (q8w) vs. 34.6% (q12w), p=0.20). There was no clinical benefit of combination therapy after 52 weeks when compared to ustekinumab monotherapy (combi 40.6% vs. mono 36.0% p=0.64). At baseline, 28 patients had active peri-anal fistula, of which 35.7% showed complete clinical resolution after 24 weeks. During follow-up we encountered six severe infections (3.5 per 100 patient years), all patients were on concomitant immunosuppressant therapies. Ustekinumab treatment discontinuation was observed in 75 (33.9%) patients mainly due to lack of response. CONCLUSION Ustekinumab is relatively safe and effective treatment option for CD patients with prior failure of anti-TNF and anti-integrin therapies.","Biemans, Vince B C; van der Meulen-de Jong, Andrea E; van der Woude, Christine J; Löwenberg, Mark; Dijkstra, Gerard; Oldenburg, Bas; de Boer, Nanne K H; van der Marel, Sander; Bodelier, Alexander G L; Jansen, Jeroen M; Haans, Jeoffrey J L; Theeuwen, Rosaline; de Jong, Dirk; Pierik, Marie J; Hoentjen, Frank",Journal of Crohn's & colitis,https://doi.org/10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjz119; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31219157/,865
124413,Pathologic Tumor Size as a Predictor of the Survival Outcomes of Patients With Glottic Carcinoma.,2020-07-07,"OBJECTIVES To analyze the relationship of birth weight, birth order, breastfeeding duration, and age of introduction of solid foods with height, fat mass, and fat-free mass in a sample of Maya children when aged 6 to 8 years old. METHODS We collected data on anthropometry, body composition, children's birth weight, birth order, early feeding practices, and household socioeconomic characteristics in a sample of 260 Maya children aged 6 to 8 years living in Merida and Motul, two cities in Yucatan, Mexico. Multiple regression models were performed to identify variables associated with height-for-age (HAZ), fat mass index (FMI), and fat-free mass index (FFMI). The predictors included in the models were birth weight (kg), birth order, duration of breastfeeding (months), age at introduction of solid foods (months), maternal age (years), and height (cm). Models were adjusted for the influence of children's age and sex, maternal educational level, and household overcrowding. RESULTS HAZ was positively associated with child birthweight and maternal height and age, but inversely associated with birth order and age of introduction of solid foods. FMI was positively associated with birth weight, maternal age, and height, and negatively associated with birth order. FFMI was positively associated with maternal age and birth weight. CONCLUSIONS These results are evidence of the importance of the first 1000 days of life for the growth and body composition of Maya children and contributed to understand the development of nutritional dual burden in this population.","Sanchez-Escobedo, Samantha; Azcorra, Hugo; Bogin, Barry; Hoogesteijn, Almira L; Sámano, Reyna; Varela-Silva, Maria I; Dickinson, Federico",American journal of human biology : the official journal of the Human Biology Council,https://doi.org/10.1002/ajhb.23385; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31994809/,865
127868,Droplet Exposure Risk to Providers From In-Office Flexible Laryngoscopy: A COVID-19 Simulation.,2020-08-18,"Biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch (BPD/DS) is considered the most effective surgical option for morbidly obese patients. Several techniques have been described: open, laparoscopic, and the combination of open and laparoscopic. Only a few centers in the world perform robotically-assisted laparoscopic BPD/DS and the published literature is limited. We describe our experience using this technique as a safe alternative for treatment of morbid obesity. A review of a prospectively maintained database from 2008 to 2011 was conducted. A total of 107 consecutive patients (F:M = 83:24) were included in this series. Average age was 44.76 years (range 20-67), body mass index 49.97 kg/m(2) (range 37-70), and the number of preoperative comorbidities was 6.24 (range 3-11). The mean operative time for a typical BPD/DS with or without an appendectomy was 264 min (range 192-413), which increased to 298 min (range 210-463) when lysis of adhesion or additional procedures were performed. All study cases were completed using a minimally invasive approach. There were no intraoperative or 30-day major postoperative complications. Two patients returned to the operating room: one for endoscopic release of an inadvertently-sutured nasogastric tube during creation of the duodeno-ileal anastomosis and another patient for a port-site infection. Minor postoperative complications included carpal tunnel syndrome exacerbation (n = 1), which did not require surgical intervention. The median length of stay was 3.0 days (range 2-13). Two patients were readmitted within 30 day due to fluid retention and incarcerated umbilical hernia. The percentages of excess body weight loss (EBWL) at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 18 months were 18.9, 36.4, 54.5, 67.4, 73.9, and 82.42 %, respectively. No mortality occurred in this study. Robotically-assisted laparoscopic technique for BPD/DS is a feasible, safe, and effective alternative for weight loss surgery with excellent outcomes.","Antanavicius, Gintaras; Sucandy, Iswanto",Journal of robotic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11701-012-0372-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27000921/,865

Because of its ubiquity, it is necessary that school nurses have an enhanced understanding of some of the mental health conditions that children and adolescents may be facing. As will be discussed, some mental health concerns present with somatic symptoms that may bring the student into the school nurse's office. If the nurse identifies mental health symptoms, he or she may be able to intervene, provide support, and direct the student for further management if necessary. This article will focus on anxiety in general before focusing on specific anxiety disorders, including posttraumatic stress disorder. We will begin by defining these conditions and then move into discussing potential present-day stressors, such as fear and anxiety associated with the recent coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, and screening tools before closing with some suggestions for practice and a case wrap-up.","Chardavoyne, Paige; Olympia, Robert P",NASN school nurse,https://doi.org/10.1177/1942602x20955154; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32924776/,865
161787,The Difficult Airway and Aerosol-Generating Procedures in COVID-19: Timeless Principles for Uncertain Times.,2020-06-23,"COVID-19 infection tends to be more lethal in older persons than in the young; death results from an overactive inflammatory response, leading to cytokine storm and organ failure. Here we describe immune regulation of the inflammatory response phenotype as emerging from a process that is analogous to machine-learning algorithms used in computers. We briefly describe some strategic similarities between immune learning and computer machine learning. We reason that a balanced response to COVID-19 infection might be induced by treating the elderly patient with a wellness repertoire of antibodies obtained from healthy young people. We propose that a beneficial training set of such antibodies might be administered in the form of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg).","Cohen, Irun R; Efroni, Sol; Atlan, Henri",Critical reviews in immunology,https://doi.org/10.1615/critrevimmunol.2020034784; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33389884/,865

Corticosteroid therapy in ENT in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To examine whether general and dental health and habits of families were affected by the first-wave lockdown due to COVID-19, and whether these habits were related to family functioning, resilience and stress. STUDY DESIGN: A cross-sectional study using an online survey disseminated among families with kindergarten and primary school-aged children during the lockdown of March and April 2020. RESULTS: A total of 361 respondents completed the survey. Most respondents adapted well to the changes imposed by lockdown and reported that they and their children had low anxiety levels and high mental resilience. Family functioning and behavior were positively correlated with nutrition habits and hygiene. General hygiene was positively correlated with oral hygiene. Respondents who reported requiring dental care had difficulties gaining access to it. Most respondents perceived that it is important to improve patients' digital access to pediatricians and dentists during crises. CONCLUSION: The study showed that better family functioning was associated with better family hygiene and nutrition, parental resilience and lower mental stress among children.","Blumer, Sigalit; Dagon, Nurit; Peretz, Benjamin; Ratson, Tal; Kharouba, Johnny",J Clin Pediatr Dent,,865
231865,Consensus statement. Corticosteroid therapy in ENT in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"The novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, has challenged healthcare systems globally. The health inequities experienced by immigrants, refugees, and racial/ethnic minorities have been aggravated during the COVID-19 pandemic. The socioeconomic, political, and demographic profile of these vulnerable populations places them at increased risk of contracting COVID-19 and experiencing significant morbidity and mortality. Thus, the burden of the COVID-19 pandemic is disproportionally higher among these at-risk groups. The purpose of this perspective is to: (1) highlight the interactions among the social determinants of health (SDoH) and their bi-directional relationship with the COVID-19 pandemic which results in the current syndemic and; (2) offer recommendations that consider an integrated approach to mitigate COVID-19 risk for marginalized populations in general. For these at-risk populations, we discuss how individual, structural, sociocultural, and socioeconomic factors interact with each other to result in a disparate risk to contracting and transmitting COVID-19. Marginalized populations are the world's collective responsibility. We recommend implementing the Essential Public Health Services (EPHS) framework to promote those systems and policies that enable optimal health for all while removing systemic and structural barriers that have created health inequities. The pledge of ""Health for All"" is often well-accepted in theory, but the intricacy of its practical execution is not sufficiently recognized during this COVID-19 syndemic and beyond.","Caron, Rosemary M; Adegboye, Amanda Rodrigues Amorim",Front Public Health,,865
259778,An Unusual Case of a Pediatric Nasal Septal Abscess with Life-Threatening Complications in COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"Economic activities and the associated emissions have significantly declined during the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, which has created a natural experiment to assess the impact of the emitted precursor control policy on ozone (O-3) pollution. In this study, we utilized comprehensive satellite, ground-level observations, and source-oriented chemical transport modeling to investigate the O-3 variations during the COVID-19 pandemic in China. Here, we found that the significant elevated O-3 in the North China Plain (40%) and Yangtze River Delta (35%) were mainly attributed to the enhanced atmospheric oxidation capacity (AOC) in these regions, associated with the meteorology and emission reduction during lockdown. Besides, O-3 formation regimes shifted from VOC-limited regimes to NOx-limited and transition regimes with the decline of NOx during lockdown. We suggest that future O-3 control policies should comprehensively consider the effects of AOC on the O-3 elevation and coordinated regulations of the O-3 precursor emissions. Plain Language Summary Severe ozone (O-3) pollution has been a public concern in China during the last decade. Due to the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, China has implemented the strict restrictions, leading to the significant decline of economic activities and the associated emissions. However, the O-3 levels have been elevated in vast areas of China during the COVID-19 lockdown period. In this study, we applied the comprehensive satellite, ground-level observations, and source-oriented chemical transport modeling to investigate the O-3 elevation during the COVID-19 lockdown periods. Importantly, our results showed that O-3 has increased significantly in North China Plain (40%) and Yangtze River Delta (35%) during lockdown, which attributed to the enhanced atmospheric oxidation capacity (AOC) associated with the meteorology and emission reduction. Besides, we found the O-3 formation regimes shifted from VOC-limited to NOx-limited due to the lower NOx during lockdown. In the future, we suggest that O-3 control policies ought to ensure a balance between emitted NOx and VOCs to maintain stable O-3 formation regimes and AOC levels and thereby control O-3 emissions.","Zhu, S.

272220,Awareness of an Primitive Art for Treating Otological Diseases in Present Covid-19 Scenario: Need of the Hour,2020,"From a local outbreak to a global pandemic, the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 infection has spread across 210 borders to infect 2.5 million humans. There is an organized disruption in the routine hospital functioning to divert the available resources for effective crisis management; most of the departments have been split to carve out a 'COVID task force.' The recommended indications for treatment of various medical conditions, medical procedures, and protocols have regressed on the evolutionary timeline. Newer recommendations are being released and updated regularly based on emerging evidence and experts' opinions. In view of exponential spread of the virus through routes already identified or those still elusive, the shedding of the virus during the incubation period, and lack of scientific evidence, the questions of 'laparoscopy' or 'no laparoscopy' assume importance. Herein, the evidence in literature pertaining to patient safety, efficient and effective utilization of hospital resources, and safety of health-care workers (HCWs) during the pandemic have been reviewed from the perspective of laparoscopy. The pathobiology of the virus including its survival properties and the different modes of transmission has been highlighted, and the relative risk to the HCWs between open and laparoscopic surgery dwelt upon. The recommendations from various international bodies have been discussed. Notwithstanding the absence of concrete evidence to exclude the possibility of bioaerosol-based transmission of the disease to the operating room staff, there is a multitude of other concerns which are addressed by avoiding the use of the laparoscope in the current scenario. Moreover, the absence of evidence is not evidence of absence; considering the high contagion and a long latent period associated with this virus, the onus is upon each individual surgeon to decide if one needs evidence of bioaerosol-based transmission or evidence in favor of safety before taking up 'laparoscopy' against 'open surgery'.","Goel, Prabudh; Basu, Ashoke K.",J.

296070,Correlation Between Anosmia and Severity Along with Requirement of Tocilizumab in COVID-19 Patients,2021,"The present study investigated ultraviolet-induced in situ gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) coupled with loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) for the point-of-care testing (POCT) of two major infectious pathogens, namely, Coronavirus (COVID-19) and Enterococcus faecium (E. faecium spp.). In the process, gold ions in a gold chloride (HAuCl4) solution were reduced using trisodium citrate (Na3Ct), a reducing agent, and upon UV illumination, red-colored AuNPs were produced in the presence of LAMP amplicons. The nitrogenous bases of the target deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) acted as a physical support for capturing gold ions dissolved in the sample. The high affinity of gold with the nitrogenous bases enabled facile detection within 10 min, and the detection limit of COVID-19 plasmid DNA was as low as 42 fg µL-1. To ensure POCT, we designed a portable device that contained arrays of reagent chambers and detection chambers. In the portable device, colorimetric reagents such as HAuCl4 and Na3Ct were contained in the reagent chambers; these reagents were subsequently transferred to the detection chambers where LAMP amplicons were present and thus allowed convenient sample delivery and multiplex detection. Owing to the high sensitivity of the in situ AuNPs, simplicity of portable device fabrication, and rapid colorimetric detection, we strongly believe that the fabricated portable device could serve as a kit for rapid POCT for instantaneous detection of infectious diseases, and could be readily usable at the bedside.","Sivakumar, Rajamanickam; Dinh, Vu Phong; Lee, Nae Yoon",Lab Chip,,865

We aimed to study the effects of newly initiated antihypertensive drugs on angiotensin (Ang) II and Ang (1-7) as representers of two counter-regulatory axes. (2) Methods: In this randomized, open-label trial investigating RAAS peptides after the initiation of perindopril, olmesartan, amlodipine, or hydrochlorothiazide, Ang II and Ang (1-7) equilibrium concentrations were measured at 8 a.m. and 12 a.m. at baseline and after four weeks of treatment. Eighty patients were randomized (1:1:1:1 fashion). (3) Results: Between the four substances, we found significant differences regarding the concentrations of Ang II (p < 0.0005 for 8 a.m., 12 a.m.) and Ang (1-7) (p = 0.019 for 8 a.m., <0.0005 for 12 a.m.) four weeks after treatment start. Ang II was decreased by perindopril (p = 0.002), and increased by olmesartan (p < 0.0005), amlodipine (p = 0.012), and hydrochlorothiazide (p = 0.001). Ang (1-7) was increased by perindopril and olmesartan (p = 0.008/0.002), but not measurably altered by amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide (p = 0.317/ 0.109). (4) Conclusion: The initiation of all first line antihypertensive treatments causes early and distinct alterations of equilibrium angiotensin levels. Given the additional AT1R blocking action of olmesartan, RAAS peptides shift upon initiation of perindopril and olmesartan appear to work in favor of the anti-inflammatory axis compared to amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide.","Vischer, Annina S; Kuster, Gabriela M; Twerenbold, Raphael; Pfister, Otmar; Zhou, Qian; Villiger, Andrea; Poglitsch, Marko; Krähenbühl, Stephan; Mayr, Michael; Osswald, Stefan; Haschke, Manuel; Burkard, Thilo",,,865

This article suggests that the importance of the human role of the economy is now unusually palpable, and calls into question the divisions and inequalities across spatial and institutional specialization. We propose a new category of “public good” to account for the importance of political participation in the design of human institutions, to refer to both recognition and security. Rather than simply the opposite of private goods, the concept of public goods can incorporate human capacity and public agency. Whereas typical economic categories are presumably “technical,” without relationship to humans, these new proposed categories highlight the importance of humans, and humanity, as the primary focus of economic “performance,” not only in productivity and efficiency but also in quality of life and work. © 2021, Journal of Economic Issues / Association for Evolutionary Economics.","Davis, A.

517605,Simple Face Shield for Public as a Crucial Factor to Slow Aerosol Transmission During Unlock Phase of COVID Pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have emerged as safe and effective alternatives to Vitamin-K antagonists for treatment and prevention of arterial and venous thrombosis. Due to their novelty, pharmacokinetic DOAC drug-drug interactions (DDIs) that result in clinical adverse events have not been well-documented. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to systematically review reported pharmacokinetic DDIs resulting in clinical adverse events through documented observational evidence to better inform clinicians in clinical practice. METHODS: A comprehensive literature review of EMBASE, MEDLINE, and Ovid HealthStar was conducted through March 10th, 2020. Two independent reviewers screened and extracted data from eligible articles according to pre-established inclusion and exclusion criteria. Articles reporting bleeding or thrombotic outcomes in non-controlled (observational) settings resulting from suggested pharmacokinetic DOAC DDIs were included. RESULTS: A total of 5567 citations were reviewed, of which 24 were included following data extraction. The majority were case reports (n = 21) documenting a single adverse event resulting from a suspected DOAC DDI, while the remaining papers were a case series (n = 1) and cohort studies (n = 2). The most commonly reported interacting drugs were amiodarone and ritonavir (bleeding), and phenobarbital, phenytoin, and carbamazepine (thrombosis). Bleeding events more often resulted from a combined mechanism (P-glycoprotein AND CYP3A4 inhibition), whereas thrombotic events resulted from either combined OR single P-glycoprotein/CYP3A4 induction. CONCLUSION: Current literature evaluating the real-world risk of DOAC DDIs is limited to few case reports and retrospective observational analyses. Clinicians are encouraged to continue to report suspected drug interactions resulting in adverse events.","Li, Allen; Li, Ming K; Crowther, Mark; Vazquez, Sara R",Thromb Res,,865
520255,Best practice recommendations: ENT consultations during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"With the ever-increasing speed and volume of knowledge production and consumption, scholarly communication systems have been rapidly transformed into digitised and networked open ecosystems, where preprint servers have played a pivotal role. However, evidence is scarce regarding how this paradigm shift has affected the dynamics of collective attention on scientific knowledge. Herein, we address this issue by investigating the citation dynamics of more than 1.5 million eprints on arXiv, the most prominent and oldest eprint archive. The discipline-average citation history curves are estimated by applying a nonlinear regression model to the long-term citation data. The revealed spatiotemporal characteristics, including the growth and obsolescence patterns, are shown to vary across disciplines, reflecting the different publication and citation practices. The results are used to develop a spatiotemporally normalised citation index, called the $\gamma$-index, with an approximately normal distribution. It can be used to compare the citational impact of individual papers across disciplines and time periods, providing a less biased measure of research impact than those widely used in the literature and in practice. Further, a stochastic model for the observed spatiotemporal citation dynamics is derived, reproducing both the Lognormal Law for the cumulative citation distribution and the time trajectory of average citations in a unified formalism.","Okamura, Keisuke",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.05027v1.pdf,865
523446,Anosmia due to dryness in about 1771: An ancestor of COVID-19?,2021,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has raised numerous questions among patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases regarding potential reciprocal effects of COVID-19 and their underlying disease, and potential effects of immunomodulatory therapy on outcomes related to COVID-19. The seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 and factors associated with symptomatic COVID-19 in patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases are still unclear. The Euro-COVIMID study aimed to determine the serological and clinical prevalence of COVID-19 among patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases, as well as factors associated with COVID-19 occurrence and the impact of the pandemic in its management. Methods: In this multicentre cross-sectional study, patients aged 18 years or older with a clinical diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, axial spondyloarthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjögren's syndrome, or giant cell arteritis were recruited from six tertiary referral centres in France, Germany, Italy, Portugal, Spain, and the UK. Demographics, comorbidities, treatments, and recent disease flares, as well as information on COVID-19 symptoms, were collected through a questionnaire completed by participants. SARS-CoV-2 serology was systematically tested. The main outcome was the serological and clinical prevalence of COVID-19. Factors associated with symptomatic COVID-19 were assessed by multivariable logistic regression, and incidence of recent disease flares, changes in treatments for underlying disease, and the reasons for treatment changes were also assessed. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04397237. Findings: Between June 7 and Dec 8, 2020, 3136 patients with an immune-mediated inflammatory disease answered the questionnaire. 3028 patients (median age 58 years [IQR 46-67]; 2239 [73·9%] women and 789 [26·1%] men) with symptomatic COVID-19, serological data, or both were included in analyses. SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detected in 166 (5·5% [95% CI 4·7-6·4]) of 3018 patients who had serology tests. Symptomatic COVID-19 occurred in 122 (4·0% [95% CI 3·4-4·8]) of 3028 patients, of whom 24 (19·7%) were admitted to hospital and four (3·3%) died. Factors associated with symptomatic COVID-19 were higher concentrations of C-reactive protein (odds ratio 1·18, 95% CI 1·05-1·33; p=0·0063), and higher numbers of recent disease flares (1·27, 1·02-1·58; p=0·030), whereas use of biological therapy was associated with reduced risk (0·51, 0·32-0·82; p=0·0057). At least one disease flare occurred in 654 (21·6%) of 3028 patients. Over the study period, 519 (20·6%) of 2514 patients had treatment changes, of which 125 (24·1%) were due to the pandemic. Interpretation: This study provides key insights into the epidemiology and risk factors of COVID-19 among patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases. Overall, immunosuppressants do not seem to be deleterious in this scenario, and the control of inflammatory activity seems to be key when facing the pandemic.

523709,Otolaryngology in the Time of Corona: Assessing Operative Impact and Risk During the COVID-19 Crisis,2020,"One important concern around the spread of respiratory infectious diseases has been the contribution of public transportation, a space where people are in close contact with one another and with high-use surfaces. While disease clearly spreads along transportation routes, there is limited evidence about whether public transportation use itself is associated with the overall prevalence of contagious respiratory illnesses at the local level. We examine the extent of the association between public transportation and influenza mortality, a proxy for disease prevalence, using city-level data on influenza and pneumonia mortality and public transit use from 121 large cities in the United States (US) between 2006 and 2015. We find no evidence of a positive relationship between city-level transit ridership and influenza/pneumonia mortality rates, suggesting that population level rates of transit use are not a singularly important factor in the transmission of influenza.","Howland, Renata E; Cowan, Nicholas R; Wang, Scarlett S; Moss, Mitchell L; Glied, Sherry",PLoS One,,865
605315,Endoscopy in Otorhinolaryngology During Corona Outbreak: A Proposal for Safe Practice,2020-08-13,"INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 has spread globally to now be considered a pandemic by the World Health Organisation. Initially patients appeared to have a respiratory limited disease but there are now increasing reports of multiple organ involvement including renal disease in association with COVID-19. We studied the development and outcomes of acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients with COVID-19, in a large multicultural city hospital trust in the UK, to better understand the role renal disease has in the disease process. METHODS: This was a retrospective review using electronic records and laboratory data of adult patients admitted to the four Manchester University Foundation Trust Hospitals between March 10 and April 30 2020 with a diagnosis of COVID-19. Records were reviewed for baseline characteristics, medications, comorbidities, social deprivation index, observations, biochemistry and outcomes including mortality, admission to critical care, mechanical ventilation and the need for renal replacement therapy. RESULTS: There were 1032 patients included in the study of whom 210 (20.3%) had AKI in association with the diagnosis of COVID-19. The overall mortality with AKI was considerably higher at 52.4% compared to 26.3% without AKI (p-value <0.001). More patients with AKI required escalation to critical care (34.8% vs 11.2%, p-value <0.001). Following admission to critical care those with AKI were more likely to die (54.8% vs 25.0%, p-value <0.001) and more likely to require mechanical ventilation (86.3% vs 66.3%, p-value 0.006). DISCUSSION: We have shown that the development of AKI is associated with dramatically worse outcomes for patients, in both mortality and the requirement for critical care. Patients with COVID-19 presenting with, or at risk of AKI should be closely monitored and appropriately managed to prevent any decline in renal function, given the significant risk of deterioration and death.","Hamilton, Patrick; Hanumapura, Prasanna; Castelino, Laveena; Henney, Robert; Parker, Kathrine; Kumar, Mukesh; Murphy, Michelle; Al-Sayed, Tamer; Pinnington, Sarah; Felton, Tim; Challiner, Rachael; Ebah, Leonard",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33141867/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0241544,865

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The cross-sectional study included 304 respondents recruited for the whole month of July 2020 through various social media platforms. Participants were requested to answer an online questionnaire, and results were analyzed using SPSS software. RESULTS: The majority of respondents were female (71.1%), with an average age of 29, college graduate (57.6%), and living in an area where modified general community quarantine is implemented (63.2%). Good preventive behavior was noted among the participants, and not shaking of hands with others and refraining from touching of surfaces were reported as the most practiced behavior. Spearman's correlation and Pearson's Chi-square showed that age and sex are significant predictors for the HBM constructs and preventive behavior. Furthermore, results showed that cues to action, self-efficacy, and perceived barrier have a significant association with COVID-19 preventive behavior. CONCLUSION: Findings prove that HBM is useful in understanding preventive behaviors in times of coronavirus pandemic. Strategies that promote a supportive environment and help overcome the perceived barriers can guide Filipinos to adopt the desired health behavior. Interventions to promote preventive behaviors should be focused on males and younger individuals.","Arceo, Engracia; Jurado, John Edlor; Cortez, Leslee Anne; Sibug, Nestor; Sarmiento, Gestrelle Lides; Lawingco, Amica Coleen; Carbungco, Carisse; Tiongco, Raphael Enrique",J Educ Health Promot,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34395665/; https://doi.org/10.4103/jehp.jehp_1441_20,865

She was admitted to hospital at 27 weeks' gestation with a history of cognitive decline and difficulty completing simple tasks. She had no clinical signs of infection. The working diagnosis was autoimmune encephalitis, although extensive investigations did not lead to a final classifying diagnosis. The patient became comatose and developed hypertension, and an emergency caesarean section was done at 31 weeks to deliver the child, who seemed healthy. The patient died about 6 weeks after the onset of symptoms. The patient was found to have had subacute sclerosing panencephalitis at autopsy. In this Grand Round, we review the clinical features and treatment of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, and the epidemiological and public health aspects of the case.","Chiu, Michael H; Meatherall, Bonnie; Nikolic, Ana; Cannon, Kristine; Fonseca, Kevin; Joseph, Jeffrey T; MacDonald, Judy; Pabbaraju, Kanti; Tellier, Raymond; Wong, Sallene; Koch, Marcus W",The Lancet Infectious Diseases,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1473309915005241; https://doi.org/10.1016/s1473-3099(15)00524-1; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1473309915005241; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26809815/,865
