171,171,171,Seasonality of Influenza A(H3N2) Virus: A Hong Kong Perspective (1997–2006),15.219912,8.333845,2008-07-23,"BACKGROUND: The underlying basis for the seasonality of influenza A viruses is still uncertain. Phylogenetic studies investigated this phenomenon but have lacked sequences from more subtropical and tropical regions, particularly from Southeast Asia. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: 281 complete hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) sequences were obtained from influenza A(H3N2) viruses, collected over 10 years (1997–2006) from Hong Kong. These dated sequences were analyzed with influenza A(H3N2) vaccine strain sequences (Syd/5/97, Mos/10/99, Fuj/411/02, Cal/7/04) and 315 other publicly available dated sequences from elsewhere, worldwide. In addition, the NA sequence alignment was inspected for the presence of any naturally occurring, known, neuraminidase inhibitor (NAI) resistance-associated amino acid mutations (R292K and E119V). Before 2001, the Hong Kong HA and NA sequences clustered more closely with the older vaccine sequences (Syd/5/97, Mos/10/99) than did sequences from elsewhere. After 2001, this trend reversed with significant clusters containing HA and NA sequences from different locations, isolated at different times, suggesting that viral migration may account for much of the influenza A(H3N2) seasonality during this 10-year period. However, at least one example from Hong Kong was found suggesting that in some years, influenza A(H3N2) viruses may persist in the same location, perhaps continuing to circulate, sub-clinically, at low levels between seasons, to re-emerge in the influenza season the following year, relatively unchanged. None of these Hong Kong influenza A(H3N2) NA sequences contained any of the known NAI-resistance associated mutations. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The seasonality of influenza A(H3N2) may be largely due to global migration, with similar viruses appearing in different countries at different times. However, occasionally, some viruses may remain within a single location and continue to circulate within that population, to re-emerge during the next influenza season, with relatively little genetic change. Naturally occurring NAI resistance mutations were absent or, at least, very rare in this population.","Tang, Julian W.; Ngai, Karry L. K.; Lam, Wai Y.; Chan, Paul K. S.",PLoS One,99,28
198,198,198,Hemorrhagic shock and encephalopathy syndrome – the markers for an early HSES diagnosis,15.426708,8.598539,2008-10-16,"BACKGROUND: The hemorrhagic shock and encephalopathy syndrome (HSES) is a devastating disease that affects young children. The outcomes of HSES patients are often fatal or manifesting severe neurological sequelae. We reviewed the markers for an early diagnosis of HSES. METHODS: We examined the clinical, biological and radiological findings of 8 patients (4 months to 9 years old) who met the HSES criteria. RESULTS: Although cerebral edema, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC), and multiple organ failure were seen in all 8 cases during their clinical courses, brain computed tomography (CT) scans showed normal or only slight edema in 5 patients upon admission. All 8 patients had normal platelet counts, and none were in shock. However, they all had severe metabolic acidosis, which persisted even after 3 hours (median base excess (BE), -7.6 mmol/L). And at 6 hours after admission (BE, -5.7 mmol/L) they required mechanical ventilation. Within 12 hours after admission, fluid resuscitation and vasopressor infusion for hypotension was required. Seven of the patients had elevated liver enzymes and creatine kinase (CK) upon admission. Twenty-four hours after admission, all 8 patients needed vasopressor infusion to maintain blood pressure. CONCLUSION: CT scan, platelet count, hemoglobin level and renal function upon admission are not useful for an early diagnosis of HSES. However, the elevated liver enzymes and CK upon admission, hypotension in the early stage after admission with refractory acid-base disturbance to fluid resuscitation and vasopressor infusion are useful markers for an early HSES diagnosis and helpful to indicate starting intensive neurological treatment.","Rinka, Hiroshi; Yoshida, Takeshi; Kubota, Tetsushi; Tsuruwa, Miho; Fuke, Akihiro; Yoshimoto, Akira; Kan, Masanori; Miyazaki, Dai; Arimoto, Hideki; Miyaichi, Toshinori; Kaji, Arito; Miyamoto, Satoru; Kuki, Ichiro; Shiomi, Masashi",BMC Pediatr,99,22
1263,1263,1263,CD13 is essential for inflammatory trafficking and infarct healing following permanent coronary artery occlusion in mice,15.123535,8.605891,2013-06-12,"AIMS: To determine the role of CD13 as an adhesion molecule in trafficking of inflammatory cells to the site of injury in vivo and its function in wound healing following myocardial infarction induced by permanent coronary artery occlusion. METHODS AND RESULTS: Seven days post-permanent ligation, hearts from CD13 knockout (CD13(KO)) mice showed significant reductions in cardiac function, suggesting impaired healing in the absence of CD13. Mechanistically, CD13(KO) infarcts showed an increase in small, endothelial-lined luminal structures, but no increase in perfusion, arguing against an angiogenic defect in the absence of CD13. Cardiac myocytes of CD13(KO) mice showed normal basal contractile function, eliminating myocyte dysfunction as a mechanism of adverse remodelling. Conversely, immunohistochemical and flow cytometric analysis of CD13(KO) infarcts demonstrated a dramatic 65% reduction in infiltrating haematopoietic cells, including monocytes, macrophages, dendritic, and T cells, suggesting a critical role for CD13 adhesion in inflammatory trafficking. Accordingly, CD13(KO) infarcts also contained fewer myofibroblasts, consistent with attenuation of fibroblast differentiation resulting from the reduced inflammation, leading to adverse remodelling. CONCLUSION: In the ischaemic heart, while compensatory mechanisms apparently relieve potential angiogenic defects, CD13 is essential for proper trafficking of the inflammatory cells necessary to prime and sustain the reparative response, thus promoting optimal post-infarction healing.","Pereira, Flavia E.; Cronin, Chunxia; Ghosh, Mallika; Zhou, Si-Yuan; Agosto, Mariela; Subramani, Jaganathan; Wang, Ruibo; Shen, Jian-Bing; Schacke, Wolfgang; Liang, Brannen; Yang, Tie Hong; McAulliffe, Beata; Liang, Bruce T.; Shapiro, Linda H.",Cardiovascular Research,99,1
1883,1883,1883,The Use of a Shelter Software (a) to Track Frequency and Selected Risk Factors for Feline Upper Respiratory Infection,15.280927,8.567074,2015-03-25,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Feline upper respiratory infection is a common disease in animal shelters. Without monitoring, effective control and prevention is difficult. We looked at a software system (a) used in shelters across the United States to determine if it can be used to track URI frequency and risk factors in a population. Reports from the software system (a) were compared to data collected manually. This showed that data currently collected were not useful for tracking URI frequency and risk factors. However, potential exists to increase the practicality and usefulness of this shelter software system to monitor URI and other diseases. ABSTRACT: Objective—Feline upper respiratory infection (URI) is a common, multi-factorial infectious disease syndrome endemic to many animal shelters. Although a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in shelter cats, URI is seldom formally monitored in shelter cat populations. Without monitoring, effective control and prevention of this often endemic disease is difficult. We looked at an integrated case management software system (a) for animal care organizations, widely used in shelters across the United States. Shelter staff routinely enter information regarding individual animals and disease status, but do not commonly use the software system to track frequency of disease. The purpose of this study was to determine if the software system (a) can be used to track URI frequency and selected risk factors in a population, and to evaluate the quality and completeness of the data as currently collected in a shelter. Design (type of study)—Descriptive Survey. Animals (or Sample)—317 cats in an animal shelter. Procedures—Reports from the software system (a) containing data regarding daily inventory, daily intake, animal identification, location, age, vaccination status, URI diagnosis and URI duration were evaluated. The reports were compared to data collected manually by an observer (Ann Therese Kommedal) to assess discrepancies, completeness, timeliness, availability and accuracy. Data were collected 6 days a week over a 4 week period. Results—Comparisons between the software system (a) reports and manually collected reports showed that 93% of inventory reports were complete and of these 99% were accurate. Fifty-two percent of the vaccination reports were complete, of which 97% were accurate. The accuracy of the software system’s age reports was 76%. Two-hundred and twenty-three cats were assigned a positive or negative URI diagnosis by the observer. The predictive value of the URI status in the software system (a) was below 60% both for positive and negative URI diagnosis. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance—data currently collected and entered into the software systems in the study shelter, was not useful for tracking URI frequency and risk factors, due to issues with both data quality and capture. However, the potential exists to increase the practicality and usefulness of this shelter software system to monitor URI and other diseases. Relevant data points, i.e., health status at intake and outcome, vaccination date and status, as well as age, should be made mandatory to facilitate more useful data collection and reporting.","Kommedal, Ann Therese; Wagner, Denae; Hurley, Kate",Animals (Basel),99,2
3909,3909,3909,The interleukin-4/PPARγ signaling axis promotes oligodendrocyte differentiation and remyelination after brain injury,15.442869,8.33889,2019-06-21,"The repair of white matter damage is of paramount importance for functional recovery after brain injuries. Here, we report that interleukin-4 (IL-4) promotes oligodendrocyte regeneration and remyelination. IL-4 receptor expression was detected in a variety of glial cells after ischemic brain injury, including oligodendrocyte lineage cells. IL-4 deficiency in knockout mice resulted in greater deterioration of white matter over 14 d after stroke. Consistent with these findings, intranasal delivery of IL-4 nanoparticles after stroke improved white matter integrity and attenuated long-term sensorimotor and cognitive deficits in wild-type mice, as revealed by histological immunostaining, electron microscopy, diffusion tensor imaging, and electrophysiology. The selective effect of IL-4 on remyelination was verified in an ex vivo organotypic model of demyelination. By leveraging primary oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), microglia-depleted mice, and conditional OPC-specific peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) knockout mice, we discovered a direct salutary effect of IL-4 on oligodendrocyte differentiation that was mediated by the PPARγ axis. Our findings reveal a new regenerative role of IL-4 in the central nervous system (CNS), which lies beyond its known immunoregulatory functions on microglia/macrophages or peripheral lymphocytes. Therefore, intranasal IL-4 delivery may represent a novel therapeutic strategy to improve white matter integrity in stroke and other brain injuries.","Zhang, Qingxiu; Zhu, Wen; Xu, Fei; Dai, Xuejiao; Shi, Ligen; Cai, Wei; Mu, Hongfeng; Hitchens, T.

Despite these, there are no specific masks designed for and tested in children that are available to protect our young from the common particulate air pollutants today. We evaluated safety, fit and comfort of a specially designed paediatric N95 mask with an optional micro ventilator (micro fan, MF) in healthy children aged 7–14 years, in a randomized, two-period crossover design. The subjects’ cardiorespiratory physiological measurements were assessed in different states of physical activity under different interventions (mask without and with MF). A total of 106 subjects were recruited between July-August 2016. The use of the mask without MF increased the End-Tidal CO(2) (ETCO(2)) and Fractional concentration of Inspired CO(2) (FICO(2)) at rest and on mild exertion, as expected. The use of the mask with MF brought FICO(2) levels comparably closer to baseline levels without the mask for both activities. The mask, with or without the MF, was found to be well fitting, comfortable and safe for use in children at rest and on mild exertion. The N95 mask tested offers a promising start for more studies in the paediatric population.","Goh, Daniel Yam Thiam; Mun, Meng Wai; Lee, Wei Liang Jerome; Teoh, Oon Hoe; Rajgor, Dimple D.",Sci Rep,99,1

In this review, an attempt has been made to discuss the available knowledge within the framework of a problem-oriented approach, which appears to provide a more clinically useful insight than a drug-centred review. Following a brief discussion of the scanty data and the most interesting models to which reference can be made from a pharmacokinetic point of view (the burn patient being taken as an example), the review concentrates on the main general intervention strategies in intensive care patients. These are based mainly on non-pharmacological measures (correction of fluid and electrolyte balance, total parenteral nutrition, enterai nutrition, oxygenation and ventilatory management) and are discussed with respect to the specific challenge they present in various clinical conditions and organ failure situations. In addition, 4 major selected clinical conditions where general management criteria and careful use of prophylactic and therapeutic drug treatments must interact to cope with the variety of presentations and problems are reviewed. These include: acute cerebral damage; anti-infective prophylaxis and therapy; cardiovascular emergencies; and problems of haemostasis. Each problem is analysed in such a way as to frame the pharmacological intervention in its broader context of the underlying (established or hypothesised) pathophysiology, with special attention being paid to those methodological issues which allow an appreciation of the degree of reliability of the data and the recommendations which appear to be practiced (often haphazardly) in intensive care units. The thorough review of the published literature provided (up to mid-1986) clearly shows that in this field the quality of randomised controlled and epidemiological studies is rather unsatisfactory. It would be highly beneficial to research and to clinical care if larger multicentric protocols and prospective epidemiological comparative investigations could be carried out to investigate more timely and adequately the variables which determine drug action, and the final outcome in the many subgroups of patients which must be considered in a proper stratification of intensive care unit populations.","Farina, Maria Luisa; Bonati, Maurizio; Iapichino, Gaetano; Pesenti, Antonio; Procaccio, Francesco; Boselli, Luigi; Langer, Martin; Graziina, Augusta; Tognoni, Gianni",Drugs,99,1

Sixty male Wistar rats were randomized into sham-operated group (group A, n=10), AHNP group (group B, n=10), L-arginine-treated group (group C, n=10), L-N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (NAME)-treated group (group D, n=10), CQ-treated group (group E, n=10) and CQ+L-NAME-treated group (group F, n=10). TLR4 expression was measured by using real time-PCR and Western blotting respectively. The results showed that, in the group B, the expression of TLR4 and the levels of TNF-α and IL-6 in the lungs were significantly increased, and the nitric oxide (NO) concentration was reduced, as compared with those in the group A (P<0.05 or P<0.01). Lung injury was aggravated with the increased expression of TLR4. When the inhibitor and stimulator of TLR4, namely L-Arg and L-NAME, were added respectively, lung injury was correspondingly relieved or aggravated (P<0.05 or P<0.01). In the group E, TLR4 expression was substantially lower and NO concentration higher than those in the group B (P<0.05 or P<0.01). However, in the group F, NO concentration was markedly decreased, and the inhibitory effect of CQ on TLR4 expression and the relief of lung injury were weakened when compared with those in the group E (P<0.05 or P<0.01). It was concluded that TLR4 may play an important role in the pathogenesis and development of ALI complicated in AHNP. CQ could relieve ALI by decreasing the TLR4 expression and increasing the NO release.","Zhang, Lei; Chen, Yan; Wang, Lin; Chen, Xiao-ping; Zhang, Wan-guang; Wang, Chun-you; Wu, He-shui",J Huazhong Univ Sci Technolog Med Sci,99,1

A prospective randomized phase III study,15.269267,8.363662,2006-10-10,"In a non-randomized prospective study the need for broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy was evaluated in selectively decontaminated neutropenic patients with fever. Fifty-two adult patients with a neutrophil count < 0.5 × 10(9)/l suffered 77 febrile episodes while receiving oral antibiotics for selective decontamination. Antibiotic treatment was only initiated if additional clinical signs or the microbiological culture results pointed to the likelihood of an infection. Treatment was either empirically based (broad-spectrum) or specific (narrow-spectrum). If a causative agent was identified, therapy was adjusted accordingly. If evidence of infection was lacking after 72–96 hours, the antibiotics were discontinued, and these patients were reexamined meticulously and repeatedly. For the 40 episodes without confirmed infection, the median duration of therapy was three days (range 0–13 days) and the survival rate 100 %; for the 37 episodes with confirmed infection, the median duration of therapy was 12 days (range 1–49 days, p<0.0001) and the survival rate 85 %. After adjustment of therapy the final regimen was broad-spectrum in only 18 % of treated episodes. None of the six deaths could be attributed to the withholding or stopping of broad-spectrum therapy. It is concluded that in febrile neutropenic patients on selective decontamination a standard therapy regimen with prolonged administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics is not necessary. After initial intervention antibiotic therapy can safely be tailored to the needs of the individual patient.","de Marie, S.; van den Broek, P.

7202,7202,7202,Pneumocystis primary infection in infancy: Additional French data and review of the literature,15.519314,8.729417,2019-05-25,"Somatostatin (SRIF) is a 14-amino acid peptide hormone that is synthesized as part of a larger precursor, prepro-SRIF, consisting of a signal peptide and a proregion of 80–90 amino acids; mature SRIF is located at the carboxyl-terminus of the precursor. We have used a recombinant retroviral expression vector encoding anglerfish prepro-SRIF-I to infect rat pituitary GH(3) cells. The aim of these studies was to investigate the intracellular storage and secretion of the total pool of endogenous GH compared to that of SRIF. Several clonal lines of GH(3) cells expressing high or low levels of SRIF were treated with TRH, forskolin, or depolarizing concentrations of potassium, and the levels of intracellular and secreted GH or SRIF were determined using highly sensitive RIAs. Approximately 65% of the total GH was secreted basally, whereas less than 20% of the SRIF-immunoreactive material was basally secreted. Forskolin treatment or potassium depolarization stimulated GH release, but only about 50% above basal levels. In contrast, SRIF secretion was stimulated approximately 5-fold in response to these secretagogues. Based on its lower basal rate of secretion compared to GH and its enhanced release in response to a variety of secretagogues, we conclude that the heterologously expressed SRIF is preferentially targeted to the regulated pathway in GH(3) cells.","Fleischer, Norman; Liker, Harley; Stoller, Timothy; D'Ambra, Russell; Shields, Dennis",Mol Endocrinol,99,22

Monoclonal antibodies to bovine immunoglobulin isotypes of proven specificity were used as conjugated or catching antibody. Five days after oral inoculation (dpi) of a 5-day-old gnotobiotic calf with rotavirus, IgM rotavirus antibodies were excreted in faeces, followed 5 days later by IgA rotavirus antibodies. The increase in IgM rotavirus antibody titre coincided with the inability to detect further rotavirus excretion. Faeces IgM and IgA rotavirus antibody titres fell to low levels within 3 weeks post infection. IgG(1) and IgG(2) rotavirus antibodies were not detected in faecal samples. In serum, antibodies to rotavirus of all four isotypes were detected, starting with IgM at 5 dpi. Two SPF-calves, which were fed colostrum free of rotavirus antibodies, were vaccinated with a modified live rotavirus vaccine and challenged with virulent rotavirus 6 days later. Upon vaccination, the calves showed an antibody response similar to the response of the infected gnotobiotic calf. Intestinal IgM rotavirus antibodies were excreted before or on the day of challenge and appeared to be associated with protection against challenge infection with virulent virus and rotavirus-induced diarrhoea. In 3 control calves, which were challenged only, the antibody patterns also resembled that of the gnotobiotic calf and again the appearance of IgM rotavirus antibodies coincided with the end of the rotavirus detection period. Two other groups of 3 SPF-calves were treated similarly, but the calves were fed colostrum with rotavirus antibodies during the first 48 h of life. These calves excreted passively acquired IgG(1) and IgG(2) rotavirus antibodies in their faeces from 2 to 6 days after birth. After vaccination, no IgM or IgA antibody activity in serum or faeces was detectable. Upon challenge, all calves developed diarrhoea and excreted rotavirus. Seven to 10 days after challenge low levels of IgM rotavirus antibody were detected for a short period. These data indicate that the intestinal antibody response of young calves to an enteric viral infection is associated with the excretion of IgM antibodies, immediately followed by IgA antibodies. This response is absent or diminished in calves with passively acquired specific antibodies which may explain the failure to induce a protective intestinal immune response by oral vaccination with modified live rotavirus of calves fed colostrum containing rotavirus antibodies.","Van Zaane, Dick; Ijzerman, Johan; De Leeuw, Peter W.",Vet Immunol Immunopathol,99,1

Data were analyzed according to the known breeding sites and the level of ethanol tolerance of these species. Alcohol dehydrogenase activity was assayed with both ethanol (E) and isopropanol (I). Our results show a very broad range of activities among the 71 species investigated, the ratio of the highest value observed (D. melanogaster) to the lowest (D. pruinosa) being 65:1. A general positive correlation was found between the level of ADH activity and the capacity to detoxify ethanol. Nevertheless, many species show exceptions to this rule. Contrary to a logical expectation, adaptation to high alcoholic resources, which has been a recurrent evolutionary event, was not mediated by a more efficient use of ethanol, that is, an increase of the E/I ratio. This ratio seems to be quite variable according to the phylogeny and is especially low in the subgenus Sophophora as well as in Zaprionus. Alcohol tolerance clearly is related to the larval habitat of the species and shows that adaptation to alcoholic resources has been a major evolutionary challenge in drosophilids. This adaptation is not related to phylogeny, having occurred independently several times during the evolution of the group. Finally, it should be borne in mind that, besides metabolization and detoxification, other physiological processes such as nervous‐system tolerance or ethanol excretion may be involved in ethanol tolerance, and such functions also should be investigated. Environmental ethanol, which is certainly a major ecological parameter for many drosophilids, has selected a diversity of physiological adaptations, all related to the Adh locus, but presumably much more complicated than was previously believed.","Merçot, Herve; Defaye, Danielle; Capy, Pierre; Pla, Eliane; David, Jean R.",Evolution,99,1

However, providers do not always follow CPW, and our understanding of their perceptions is limited. Our objective was to examine pediatric hospital medicine (PHM) and pediatric emergency medicine (PEM) physician perspectives of CPW. METHODS: We conducted semistructured, in-depth, one-on-one qualitative interviews with PHM and PEM physicians between February 2017 and August 2017. Interviews were audio-recorded, professionally transcribed, and accuracy verified. Using an inductive analytic strategy, we systematically coded the data to identify themes. RESULTS: We interviewed 15 PHM and 15 PEM physicians. These providers identified many benefits and limitations of CPW, which positively or negatively impact resource utilization, communication, education of personnel, patients, and families, as well as practice behaviors and attitudes. Perceived benefits included (1) reduction of unnecessary utilization, (2) standardization of care, (3) improved communication, (4) education of oneself and others, and (5) confidence and validation when actions align with CPW. Limitations of CPW were (1) resource utilization for revisions, updates, and dissemination; (2) “tunnel vision” and cognitive biases; (3) loss of autonomy; (4) prescriptive medicine; (5) information overload; (6) pressure to adhere; and (7) guilt if actions do not align with CPW. CONCLUSIONS: CPW are tools with advantages and disadvantages that are used and viewed differently by providers. Such insight into how physicians perceive CPW may help to optimize hospital improvement work and enhance high-value care.","O’Hara, Kimberly; Tanverdi, Melisa; Reich, Jennifer; Scudamore, D.

Ultrasound measures of diaphragm thickness or diaphragm dome excursion have been used to aid in predicting extubation success or failure. The aim of this study was to determine if incorporating results of diaphragm ultrasound into usual ICU care would shorten the time to extubation. METHODS: We performed a prospective, randomized, controlled study at three Brown University teaching hospitals. Included subjects underwent block randomization to either usual care (Control) or usual care enhanced with ultrasound measurements of the diaphragm (Intervention). The primary outcome was the time to extubation after ultrasound, and the secondary outcome was the total days on the ventilator. Only intensivists in the Intervention group would have the ultrasound information on the likelihood of successful extubation available to incorporate with traditional clinical and physiologic measures to determine the timing of extubation. RESULTS: A total of 32 subjects were studied; 15 were randomized into the Control group and 17 into the Intervention group. The time from ultrasound to extubation was significantly reduced in the Intervention group compared to the Control group in patients with a ∆tdi% ≥ 30% (4.8 ± 8.4 vs 35.0 ± 41.0 h, p = 0.04). The time from ultrasound to extubation was shorter in subjects with a normally functioning diaphragm (∆tdi% ≥ 30%) compared to those with diaphragm dysfunction (∆tdi% < 30%) (23.2 ± 35.2 vs 57.3 ± 52.0 h p = 0.046). When combining the Intervention and Control groups, a value of ∆tdi% ≥ 30% for extubation success at 24 h provided a sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of 90.9%, 86.7%, 90.9%, and 86.7%, respectively.

Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards analyses showed that the time from admission to mobilization was an independent predictor of rehospitalization, and receiver-operating characteristic analysis determined an optimal cutoff value of 3 days for differentiating the patients more likely to experience a subsequent cardiac event (sensitivity, 76%; specificity, 69%; area under the curve, 0.667). Kaplan–Meier survival curve analysis showed a significantly lower event rate in the ≤ 3-day group (p = 0.001, log-rank test). In conclusion, the time from admission to mobilization may be one of the strongest predictors of rehospitalization in elderly heart failure patients. Early mobilization within 3 days may be an initial target for the acute phase treatment of heart failure.","Kono, Yuji; Izawa, Hideo; Aoyagi, Yoichiro; Ishikawa, Ayako; Sugiura, Tsubasa; Mori, Etsuko; Yanohara, Ryuzo; Ishiguro, Tomoya; Yamada, Ryo; Okumura, Satoshi; Fujiwara, Wakaya; Hayashi, Mutsuharu; Saitoh, Eiichi",Heart Vessels,99,1

STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study of late preterm infants admitted to a tertiary care NICU from January 2014–July 2015. Outcomes of late preterm infants of EOPE mothers were compared with the next late preterm infant of a LOPE mother and the next two late preterm infants of normotensive non-PE mothers. Primary outcome comprised use of continuous positive airway pressure, mechanical ventilation and/or surfactant in the 24 h after birth. RESULTS: Compared to normotensives (n = 131), adjusted odds ratio (AORs) of the primary outcome was higher in the EOPE (n = 64) and LOPE (n = 65) groups but reached statistical significance only in the EOPE group, AORs 12.9, 95% CI 3.5–37 and 2.7, 95% CI 0.95–8.1, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to late preterm infants of normotensive and LOPE mothers, infants of mothers with EOPE have significantly higher respiratory morbidity.","Soliman, Yasser; Alshaikh, Belal; Alawad, Essa; Akierman, Albert; Elsharkawy, Adel; Yusuf, Kamran",J Perinatol,99,1

In this study, we analyzed the epidemiological and genetic features of NoV outbreaks from July 2014 to June 2018 in Huzhou, China. A total of 450 stool samples collected from 51 AGE outbreaks were tested for NoVs by real-time RT PCR. Partial polymerase and capsid sequences of NoV-positive samples were amplified and sequenced for phylogenetic analysis. NoVs were found to be responsible of 84.3% of AGE outbreaks in Huzhou over the past 5 years. Most NoV outbreaks were reported in the cool months (November-March) and occurred in primary schools and kindergartens. Changes in the diversity of genotypes and the distribution of predominant types were observed in recent years. At least eight genotypes were identified, and 91.9% of the genotyped outbreaks were caused by non-GII.4 strains. The top three circulating genotypes during the study period were GII.2[P16], GII.3[P12], and GII.17[P17]. The predominant NoV genotypes in outbreaks have changed from GII.4 variants to GII.17[P17] in 2014-2015, GII.3[P12] in 2015-2016, and then GII.2[P16] in 2016-2018. Non-GII.4 NoVs play an increasingly important role in outbreaks in Huzhou. Continuous surveillance is needed to monitor the emergence of novel NoV strains and help control NoV outbreaks in the next epidemic season.","Chen, Liping; Xu, Deshun; Wu, Xiaofang; Liu, Guangtao; Ji, Lei",Arch Virol,99,1

They grow and develop in a wide range of host environments, both within blood-feeding mosquitoes, their definitive hosts, and in vertebrates, which are intermediate hosts. This diversity is testament to their exceptional adaptability and poses a major challenge for developing effective strategies to reduce the disease burden and transmission. Following one asexual amplification cycle in the liver, parasites reach high burdens by rounds of asexual replication within red blood cells. A few of these blood-stage parasites make a developmental switch into the sexual stage (or gametocyte), which is essential for transmission. The bone marrow, in particular the haematopoietic niche (in rodents, also the spleen), is a major site of parasite growth and sexual development. This Review focuses on our current understanding of blood-stage parasite development and vascular and tissue sequestration, which is responsible for disease symptoms and complications, and when involving the bone marrow, provides a niche for asexual replication and gametocyte development. Understanding these processes provides an opportunity for novel therapies and interventions.","Venugopal, Kannan; Hentzschel, Franziska; Valkiūnas, Gediminas; Marti, Matthias",Nat Rev Microbiol,99,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 2012 and 2016, 24 patients of DFN with an average age of 71.8 years (66–83) and an average 1.9(1–3) prior surgery was managed with distal femur replacement using cemented modular endoprosthesis. Outcomes were analysed on the following criteria: implant status, complications, knee range of motion, Knee Society Score (KSS) and Musculoskeletal Tumor Society (MSTS) score. RESULTS: All patients were extremely satisfied with their outcomes. At an average 22.1 months (10–43) follow-up, patients had an average 69.5° (40°-110°) knee flexion, an average KSS of 75.7 (63–88) and an average MSTS score of 19.3 (17–25). Four patients died at an average 21.3 months after surgery due to causes unrelated to the fracture. One patient (4.1%) had implant-related complication; deep infection which required debridement and intravenous antibiotics. There were no late amputations or peri-operative deaths and no patient had aseptic loosening of components. CONCLUSION: By permitting immediate full weight-bearing ambulation and with most patients returning to an acceptable functional status, cemented megaprosthesis is a viable and useful single-stage management option in elderly patients with DFN.","Rajasekaran, Raja Bhaskara; Palanisami, Dhanasekara Raja; Natesan, Rajkumar; Jayaramaraju, Dheenadhayalan; Rajasekaran, Shanmuganathan",Int Orthop,99,17

The present meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate thyroid dysfunction in Iranian pregnant women. METHODS: We registered this review at PROSPERO (registration number: CRD42020166655). The research steps in this systematic review and meta-analysis were performed according to the MOOSE protocol, and finally, reports were provided based on the PRISMA guidelines. The literature search was performed in October 2019 using the international online databases, including Web of Science, Ovid, Science Direct, Scopus, EMBASE, PubMed/Medline, Cochrane Library, EBSCO, CINAHL, Google Scholar as well as national databases were reviewed. Data were extracted after applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria and qualitative evaluation of the studies. I(2) index and Q test were used to assess differences in studies. All analyses were performed using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis Software. P-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. We identified 1261 potential articles from the databases, and 426 articles remained after removing the duplicate and unrelated studies. After evaluating the full text, 52 articles were removed. RESULTS: Finally, 19 eligible studies including 17,670 pregnant women included for meta-analysis. The prevalence of thyroid dysfunction in Iranian pregnant women was 18.10% (95%CI: 13.89–23.25). The prevalence of hypothyroidism, clinical hypothyroidism, and subclinical hypothyroidism in Iranian pregnant women was respectively estimated to be 13.01% (95%CI: 9.15–18.17), 1.35% (95%CI: 0.97–1.86) and 11.90% (95%CI: 7.40–18.57). The prevalence of hyperthyroidism, clinical hyperthyroidism, and subclinical hyperthyroidism in Iranian pregnant women was respectively estimated to be 3.31% (95%CI: 1.62–6.61), 1.06% (95%CI: 0.61–1.84) and 2.56% (95%CI: 0.90–7.05). The prevalence of anti-thyroperoxidase antibody was estimated to be 11.68% (95%CI: 7.92–16.89). CONCLUSION: The results of this meta-analysis showed a high prevalence of thyroid disorders, especially hypothyroidism. The decision to recommend thyroid screening during pregnancy for all women is still under debate, because the positive effects of treatment on pregnancy outcomes must be ensured. On the other hand, evidence about the effect of thyroid screening and treatment of thyroid disorders on pregnancy outcomes is still insufficient. Nevertheless, a large percentage of general practitioners, obstetricians and gynecologists perform screening procedures in Iran.","Sepasi, Farnaz; Rashidian, Tayebeh; Shokri, Mehdi; Badfar, Gholamreza; Kazemi, Fatemeh; Azami, Milad",BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,99,1

The three different diatom strains (9B, 1G, and 7J) induced widely different effects on Acartia tonsa physiology, and the 9B strain induced different effects for the three copepods. In contrast, different strains induced no or small alterations in the distribution, swimming behavior, and turning frequency of the copepods. 22:6(n-3) fatty acid (DHA) and sterol content of the diet typically showed a positive effect on either egg production (A. tonsa) or hatching success (P. elongatus), while other measured compounds (PUA, other long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids) of the algae had no obvious effects. Our results demonstrate that differences between strains of a given diatom species can generate effects on copepod physiology, which are as large as those induced by different algae species or groups. This emphasizes the need to identify the specific characteristics of local diatoms together with the interacting effects of different mineral, biochemical, and toxic compounds and their potential implications on different copepod species.","Md Amin, Roswati; Koski, Marja; Båmstedt, Ulf; Vidoudez, Charles",Mar Biol,99,1

Here we demonstrate a promising genetic system for use in A. xylosoxidans; generating a transposon mutant library which was then used to identify genes involved in biofilm development in vitro. We further described the effects of one of the genes found in the mutagenesis screen, encoding a putative enoyl-CoA hydratase, on biofilm structure and tolerance to antimicrobials. Through additional analysis, we find that a fatty acid signaling compound is essential to A. xylosoxidans biofilm ultrastructure and maintenance.

Although the evidence supporting the use of REBOA is not conclusive, its use has expanded worldwide. We aim to compare the management approaches and clinical outcomes of trauma patients treated with REBOA according to the countries’ income based on the World Bank Country and Lending Groups. METHODS: We used data from the AORTA (USA) and the ABOTrauma (multinational) registries. Patients were stratified into two groups: (1) high-income countries (HICs) and (2) low-to-middle income countries (LMICs). Propensity score matching extracted 1:1 matched pairs of subjects who were from an LMIC or a HIC based on age, gender, the presence of pupillary response on admission, impeding hypotension (SBP ≤ 80), trauma mechanism, ISS, the necessity of CPR on arrival, the location of REBOA insertion (emergency room or operating room) and the amount of PRBCs transfused in the first 24 h. Logistic regression (LR) was used to examine the association of LMICs and mortality. RESULTS: A total of 817 trauma patients from 14 countries were included. Blind percutaneous approach and surgical cutdown were the preferred means of femoral cannulation in HICs and LIMCs, respectively. Patients from LMICs had a significantly higher occurrence of MODS and respiratory failure. LR showed no differences in mortality for LMICs when compared to HICs; neither in the non-matched cohort (OR = 0.63; 95% CI: 0.36‑1.09; p = 0.1) nor in the matched cohort (OR = 1.45; 95% CI: 0.63‑3,33; p = 0.3). CONCLUSION: There is considerable variation in the management practices of REBOA and the outcomes associated with this intervention between HICs and LMICs. Although we found significant differences in multiorgan and respiratory failure rates, there were no differences in the risk-adjusted odds of mortality between the groups analyzed. Trauma surgeons practicing REBOA around the world should joint efforts to standardize the practice of this endovascular technology worldwide.","Manzano-Nunez, Ramiro; McGreevy, David; Orlas, Claudia P.; García, Alberto F.; Hörer, Tal M.; DuBose, Joseph; Ordoñez, Carlos A.",World J Emerg Surg,99,1

Though the critical brain nodes remain unknown, schizophrenia involves networks with broad abnormalities. Hence, glutamine plus glutamate (Glx) and other metabolites were examined with whole-brain (1)H-MRS, in early schizophrenia. Three dimensional (1)H-MRS was acquired in young schizophrenia subjects (N = 36, 19 antipsychotic-naïve and 17 antipsychotic-treated) and healthy controls (HC, N = 29). Glx (as well as N-acetylaspartate, choline, myo-inositol and creatine) group contrasts from all individual voxels that met spectral quality, were analyzed in common brain space, followed by cluster-corrected level alpha-value (CCLAV ≤ 0.05). Schizophrenia subjects had lower Glx in the left superior (STG) and middle temporal gyri (16 voxels, CCLAV = 0.04) and increased creatine in two clusters involving left temporal, parietal and occipital regions (32, and 18 voxels, CCLAV = 0.02 and 0.04, respectively). Antipsychotic-treated and naïve patients (vs HC) had similar Glx reductions (8/16 vs 10/16 voxels respectively, but CCLAV’s > 0.05). However, creatine was higher in antipsychotic-treated vs HC’s in a larger left hemisphere cluster (100 voxels, CCLAV = 0.01). Also in treated patients, choline was increased in left middle frontal gyrus (18 voxels, CCLAV = 0.04). Finally in antipsychotic-naive patients, NAA was reduced in right frontal gyri (19 voxels, CCLAV = 0.05) and myo-inositol was reduced in the left cerebellum (34 voxels, CCLAV = 0.02). We conclude that data-driven spectroscopic brain examination supports that reductions in Glx in the left STG may be critical to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Postmortem and neuromodulation schizophrenia studies focusing on left STG, may provide critical mechanistic and therapeutic advancements, respectively.","Bustillo, Juan R.; Upston, Joel; Mayer, Elizabeth Grace; Jones, Thomas; Maudsley, Andrew A.; Gasparovic, Charles; Tohen, Mauricio; Lenroot, Rhoshel",Neuropsychopharmacology,99,1

T. gondii can subtly alter host behaviors—either through manipulation to enhance transmission to the feline definitive host or as a side-effect, or “constraint,” of infection. In humans, T. gondii infection, either alone or in association with other co-infecting neurotropic agents, has been reliably associated with both subtle behavioral changes and, in some cases, severe neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia. Research on the potential impact of T. gondii on the behavior of other long-lived naturally infected hosts is lacking. Recent studies reported a large number of wild red foxes exhibiting a range of aberrant behavioral traits, subsequently classified as Dopey Fox Syndrome (DFS). Here we assessed the potential association between T. gondii and/or other neurotropic agents with DFS. Live, captive foxes within welfare centers were serologically tested for T. gondii and, if they died naturally, PCR-tested for vulpine circovirus (FoxCV). Post-mortem pseudo-control wild foxes, obtained from pest management companies, were PCR-tested for T. gondii, FoxCV, canine distemper virus (CDV), canine adenovirus type (CAV)-1 and CAV-2. We also assessed, using non-invasive assays, whether T. gondii–infected foxes showed subtle behavioral alterations as observed among infected rodent (and other) hosts, including altered activity, risk, and stress levels. All foxes tested negative for CAV, CDV, CHV, and DogCV. DFS was found to be associated with singular T. gondii infection (captives vs. pseudo-controls, 33.3% (3/9) vs. 6.8% (5/74)) and singular FoxCV infection (66.7% (6/9) vs. 11.1% (1/9)) and with T. gondii/FoxCV co-infection (33.3% (3/9) vs. 11.1% (1/9)). Overall, a higher proportion of captive foxes had signs of neuroinflammation compared to pseudo-controls (66.7% (4/6) vs. 11.1% (1/9)). Consistent with behavioral changes seen in infected rodents, T. gondii–infected foxes displayed increased attraction toward feline odor (n=6 foxes). These preliminary results suggest that wild foxes with DFS are infected with T. gondii and likely co-infected with FoxCV and/or another co-infecting neurotropic agent. Our findings using this novel system have important implications for our understanding of both the impact of parasites on mammalian host behavior in general and, potentially, of the infectious causation of certain neuropsychiatric disorders.","Milne, Gregory; Fujimoto, Chelsea; Bean, Theodor; Peters, Harry J.; Hemmington, Martin; Taylor, Charly; Fowkes, Robert C.; Martineau, Henny M.; Hamilton, Clare M.; Walker, Martin; Mitchell, Judy A.; Léger, Elsa; Priestnall, Simon L.; Webster, Joanne P.",Front Psychiatry,99,1

We aimed to validate our protocol for the timing of CDH repair using the quantified patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) flow pattern. METHODS: This retrospective comparative study analyzed patients with a prenatal diagnosis of isolated CDH between 2007 and 2020. We defined the “LR ratio” as the percentage of velocity–time integral (VTI) of the left-to-right flow of PDA against overall VTI on echocardiography. Since 2010, we followed the decision criterion of performing surgery when LR ratio of > 50% has been achieved in the patients (protocol group). The protocol group (2010–2020) was compared with the historical control group (2007–2009). RESULTS: The average age at surgery was 104.1 ± 175.9 and 37.3 ± 30.6 h in the control and protocol groups, respectively (p = 0.11). Survival rate (88.9% vs. 95.0%, p = 0.53) and the rate of worsening of pulmonary hypertension within 24 h after surgery (22.2% vs. 10.0%, p = 0.57) were not different between the groups.

The effect of Tir clustering on the viability of EPEC-infected intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) is unknown. We show that EPEC induces pyroptosis in IECs in a Tir-dependent but actin polymerisation-independent manner, which was enhanced by priming with interferon gamma (IFNγ). Mechanistically, Tir clustering triggers rapid Ca(2+) influx, which induces lipopolysaccharide (LPS) internalisation, followed by activation of caspase-4 and pyroptosis. Knockdown of caspase-4 or gasdermin D (GSDMD), translocation of NleF, which blocks caspase-4 or chelation of extracellular Ca(2+), inhibited EPEC-induced cell death. IEC lines with low endogenous abundance of GSDMD were resistant to Tir-induced cell death. Conversely, ATP-induced extracellular Ca(2+) influx enhanced cell death, which confirmed the key regulatory role of Ca(2+) in EPEC-induced pyroptosis. We reveal a novel mechanism through which infection with an extracellular pathogen leads to pyroptosis in IECs.","Zhong, Qiyun; Roumeliotis, Theodoros I.; Kozik, Zuza; Cepeda-Molero, Massiel; Fernández, Luis Ángel; Shenoy, Avinash R.; Bakal, Chris; Frankel, Gad; Choudhary, Jyoti S.",PLoS Biol,99,1

METHODS: We applied Hill’s Criteria, counterfactual reasoning, and causal diagrams to evaluate a potentially causal relationship between an exposure and outcome in three published observational studies: a) one burden of disease cohort study to determine the association between type 2 diabetes and herpes zoster, b) one post-authorization safety cohort study to assess the effect of AS04-HPV-16/18 vaccine on the risk of autoimmune diseases, and c) one matched case-control study to evaluate the effectiveness of a rotavirus vaccine in preventing hospitalization for rotavirus gastroenteritis. RESULTS: Among the 9 Hill’s criteria, 8 (Strength, Consistency, Specificity, Temporality, Plausibility, Coherence, Analogy, Experiment) were considered as met for study c, 3 (Temporality, Plausibility, Coherence) for study a, and 2 (Temporary, Plausibility) for study b. For counterfactual reasoning criteria, exchangeability, the most critical assumption, could not be tested. Using these tools, we concluded that causality was very unlikely in study b, unlikely in study a, and very likely in study c. Directed acyclic graphs provided complementary visual structures that identified confounding bias and helped determine the most accurate design and analysis to assess causality. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our assessment we found causal Hill’s criteria and counterfactual thinking valuable in determining some level of certainty about causality in observational studies. Application of causal inference frameworks should be considered in designing and interpreting observational studies.

We analysed data obtained from 3521 women and men aged 60 years and older, whose fracture incidence, mortality, and bone mineral density (BMD) have been monitored since 1989. During the 20-year follow-up period, among 632 women and 184 men with a first incident fracture, the risk of sustaining a second fracture was higher in women (36%) than in men (22%), but mortality risk was higher in men (41%) than in women (25%). The increased risk of mortality was not only present with an initial fracture, but was accelerated with refractures. Key predictors of post-fracture mortality were male gender (hazard ratio [HR] 2.4; 95% CI, 1.79–3.21), advancing age (HR 1.67; 1.53–1.83), and lower femoral neck BMD (HR 1.16; 1.01–1.33). A 70-year-old man with a fracture is predicted to have a skeletal age of 75. These results were incorporated into a prediction model to aid patient-doctor discussion about fracture vulnerability and treatment decisions.","Ho-Le, Thao Phuong; Tran, Thach S; Bliuc, Dana; Pham, Hanh M; Frost, Steven A; Center, Jacqueline R; Eisman, John A; Nguyen, Tuan V",,99,1

Virtual reality (VR) exergaming is a promising intervention strategy to engage adolescents in physical activity. OBJECTIVE: The vEngage project aims to develop a physical activity intervention for adolescents using VR exergaming. Here, we describe the formative intervention development work and process of academic-industry collaboration. METHODS: The formative development was guided by the Medical Research Council framework and included recruiting an adolescent user group to provide iterative feedback, a literature review, a quantitative survey of adolescents, qualitative interviews with adolescents and parents, inductive thematic analysis of public reviews of VR exergames, a quantitative survey and qualitative interviews with users of the augmented reality running app Zombies, Run!, and building and testing a prototype with our adolescent user group. RESULTS: VR exergaming was appealing to adolescents and acceptable to parents. We identified behavior change techniques that users would engage with and features that should be incorporated into a VR exergame, including realistic body movements, accurate graphics, stepped levels of gameplay difficulty, new challenges, in-game rewards, multiplayer options, and the potential to link with real-world aspects such as physical activity trackers. We also identified some potential barriers to use, such as cost, perceived discomfort of VR headsets, and motion sickness concerns. A prototype game was developed and user-tested with generally positive feedback. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first attempt to develop a VR exergame designed to engage adolescents in physical activity that has been developed within a public health intervention development framework. Our formative work suggests that this is a very promising avenue. The benefit of the design process was the collaborative parallel work between academics and game designers and the involvement of the target population in the game (intervention) design from the outset. Developing the game within an intervention framework allowed us to consider factors, such as parental support, that would be important for future implementation. This study also serves as a call to action for potential collaborators who may wish to join this endeavor for future phases and an example of how academic-industry collaboration can be successful and beneficial.","Farič, Nuša; Smith, Lee; Hon, Adrian; Potts, Henry W W; Newby, Katie; Steptoe, Andrew; Fisher, Abi",J Med Internet Res,99,1

Cinnamaldehyde, the main component of essential oil from cinnamon, has been reported to have anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, and anti-apoptotic effects. However, it remains unknown whether cinnamaldehyde can alleviate Salmonella typhimurium infection-induced liver injury in mice. In the present study, we found that cinnamaldehyde attenuated Salmonella typhimurium-induced body weight loss, the increase of organ (liver and spleen) indexes, hepatocyte apoptosis, and the mortality rate in mice. Further study showed that cinnamaldehyde significantly alleviated Salmonella typhimurium-induced liver injury as shown by activities of alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, and myeloperoxidase, as well as malondialdehyde. The increased mRNA level of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and IFN-γ) and chemokines (CCL2 and CCL3) induced by Salmonella typhimurium were significantly abolished by cinnamaldehyde supplementation. These alterations were associated with a regulatory effect of cinnamaldehyde on TLR2, TLR4, and MyD88. 16S rDNA sequence analysis showed that Salmonella typhimurium infection led to upregulation of the abundances of genera Akkermansia, Bacteroides, Alistipes, Muribaculum, and Prevotellaceae UCG-001, and downregulation of the abundances of genera Lactobacillus, Enterorhabdus, and Eggerthellaceae (unclassified). These alterations were reversed by cinnamaldehyde supplementation. In conclusion, cinnamaldehyde attenuated the inflammatory response, oxidative stress, and apoptosis in the liver of Salmonella typhimurium-infected mice. Supplementation of cinnamaldehyde might be a preventive strategy to alleviate liver injury caused by Salmonella typhimurium infection in humans and animals.","Wang, Renjie; Li, Senlin; Jia, Hai; Si, Xuemeng; Lei, Yan; Lyu, Jirong; Dai, Zhaolai; Wu, Zhenlong",Molecules,99,1

Diarrheagenic Escherichia coli and nontyphoidal Salmonella are the two leading bacterial pathogens, followed by Shigella and Vibrio parahaemolyticus. Patients aged <5 years had higher overall positive rate of viral pathogens, while bacterial pathogens were more common in patients aged 18‒45 years. A joinpoint analysis revealed the age-specific positivity rate and how this varied for individual pathogens.

Long-term β-blocker users are known to have lower lactate concentrations and favorable sepsis outcomes. However, the effects of β1-selective and nonselective β-blockers on sepsis outcomes have not been compared. This study was conducted to investigate the impacts of different β-blocker classes on the mortality rate in septic patients. METHODS: We retrospectively screened 2678 patients admitted to the medical or surgical intensive care unit (ICU) between December 2015 and July 2017. Data from patients who met the Sepsis-3 criteria at ICU admission were included in the analysis. Premorbid β-blocker exposure was defined as the prescription of any β-blocker for at least 1 month. Bisoprolol, metoprolol, and atenolol were classified as β1-selective β-blockers, and others were classified as nonselective β-blockers. All patients were followed for 28 days or until death. RESULTS: Among 1262 septic patients, 209 (16.6%) patients were long-term β-blocker users. Patients with premorbid β-blocker exposure had lower heart rates, initial lactate concentrations, and ICU mortality. After adjustment for disease severity, comorbidities, blood pressure, heart rate, and laboratory data, reduced ICU mortality was associated with premorbid β1-selective [adjusted hazard ratio, 0.40; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.18–0.92; P = 0.030], but not non-selective β-blocker use. CONCLUSION: Premorbid β1-selective, but not non-selective, β-blocker use was associated with improved mortality in septic patients. This finding supports the protective effect of β1-selective β-blockers in septic patients. Prospective studies are needed to confirm it.

Using gas-soluble PDMS as a centrifugal microfluidic device material, the sample can be dragged in any arbitrary direction using vacuum-driven force, as opposed to in a single direction, without adding further actuation components. The vacuum-driven force allows the device to avoid the formation of air bubbles and exhibit high tolerance in the surface condition. The device was then used for sample metering and sample transferring. In addition, centrifugal force was used for sample loading and sample mixing. In this study, a series of ten-fold serial dilutions ranging from [Formula: see text] to [Formula: see text] with about 8 μL in each chamber was achieved, while the serial dilution ratio and chamber volume could easily be altered by changing the geometrical designs of the device. As a proof of concept of our hybrid approach with the centrifugal and vacuum-driven forces, ten-fold serial dilutions of a cDNA (complementary DNA) sample were prepared using the device.

METHODS: Using the inbuilt Publons search, the top institutes of nine countries of Central Asia and neighbours were identified and data on their reviewers, number of publications, number of peer reviews completed were extracted. These were compared with demographics of the countries such as population, gross domestic product, number of physicians and proportion of population enrolled for higher education. RESULTS: Amongst the top 15 institutes in Central Asia, China has claim to 12 while Kazakhstan has two and Iran has one. The number of top peer reviewers, number of verified reviews and Web of Science indexed publications from these top institutes varied directly with the number of researchers each had. Afghanistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan are not performing well on most of these while China seems to be an outlier on the upper edge of the graphs. There is good correlation between the number of researchers in the top institutes per country and both number of publications and number of completed reviews. The number of total publications per top ten institutes of each country has high correlation with various demographic parameters like total population (Spearman rho, ρ = 0.85), gross domestic product (ρ = 0.82), total number of physicians (ρ = 0.72), and number enrolled for higher education (ρ = 0.93).

Owing to the computational complexity of wrapper approaches, the poor performance of filtering techniques, and the classifier dependency of embedded approaches, hybrid approaches are more commonly used in feature selection. Hybrid approaches use filtering metrics to reduce the computational complexity of wrapper algorithms and are proved to yield better feature subset. Though filtering metrics select the features based on their significance, most of them are unstable and biased towards the metric used. Moreover, the choice of filtering metrics depends largely on the distribution of data and data types. Biomedical datasets contain features with different distribution and types adding to the complexity in the choice of filtering metric. We address this problem by proposing a stable filtering method based on rank aggregation in hybrid feature selection model with Improved Squirrel search algorithm for biomedical datasets. Our proposed model is compared with other well-known and state-of-the-art methods and the results prove that our model exhibited superior performance in terms of classification accuracy and computational time.

To address these questions we collected postmortem plasma (n = 29), CSF (n = 28), and brain (BA10) (n = 57) samples from individuals with mood disorder, mood disorder with AUD/SUD, AUD/SUD and normal controls. These samples were analyzed using a multiplex based luminex assay with a customized 4-plex cytokine/interleukins- IL-6, IL-1β, BDNF, and GDNF human acute phase based on xMAP technology platform. Protein levels were determined using a Luminex 200 instrument equipped with Xponent-analyzing software. We observed IL-6 (p = 2.1e-07), and GDNF (p = 0.046) were significantly correlated between brain and CSF. In addition, IL-6 (p = 0.031), were significantly correlated between brain and plasma. Overall diagnostic group analysis showed a significant difference with brain GDNF, p = 0.0106.

Skeletal bone integrity is maintained through bone modeling and remodeling. The mechanisms underlying this bone mass regulation are complex and interrelated. An imbalance in the regulation of bone remodeling through bone resorption and bone formation results in bone loss. Chronic inflammation influences bone mass regulation. Inflammation-related bone disorders share many common mechanisms of bone loss. These mechanisms are ultimately mediated through the uncoupling of bone remodeling. Cachexia, physical inactivity, pro-inflammatory cytokines, as well as iatrogenic factors related to effects of immunosuppression are some of the common mechanisms.

Recent genetic studies have shown an association between rs368234815 and different infectious and inflammatory disorders. It is not known if IFN-λ4 has immunomodulatory activity. The expression of another type III IFN, IFN-λ3, is also controlled by genetic polymorphisms that are strongly linked to rs368234815. Therefore, it is of interest to compare these two IFNs for their effects on immune cells. Herein, using THP-1 cells, it was confirmed that IFN-λ4 could affect the differentiation status of macrophage-like cells and dendritic cells (DCs). The global gene expression changes induced by IFN-λ4 were also characterized in in vitro generated primary macrophages. Next, human PBMC-derived CD14(+) mono-cytes were used to obtain M1 and M2 macrophages and DCs in the presence of IFN-λ3 or IFN-λ4. These DCs were cocultured with CD4(+) Th cells derived from allogenic donors and their in vitro cytokine responses were measured. The specific activity of recombinant IFN-λ4 was much lower than that of IFN-λ3, as shown by induction of IFN-stimulated genes. M1 macrophages differentiated in the presence of IFN-λ4 showed higher IL-10 secretion than those differentiated in IFN-λ3. Coculture experiments suggested that IFN-λ4 could confer a Th2-biased phenotype to allogenic Th cells, wherein IFN-λ3, under similar circumstances, did not induce a significant bias toward either a Th1 or Th2 phenotype. This study shows for the first time that IFN-λ4 may influence immune responses by immunomodulation.","De, Manjarika; Bhushan, Anand; Chinnaswamy, Sreedhar",J Leukoc Biol,99,1

It is characterized by widespread vascular calcification, endothelial fibrosis and end-organ ischemia. The mortality rate is high with infection and sepsis being the most common causes of death. Common therapies include restoration of calcium and phosphorous homeostasis, wound care and pain control. Although soft tissue calcification is a known complication in children with advanced renal disease, the incidence of CUA in pediatrics remains unknown. Additionally, current literature regarding its management in pediatric patients is lacking. We report the case of a 17-year-old African–American male patient with end-stage renal disease secondary to Wegener’s granulomatosis who developed CUA after 3 years on peritoneal dialysis. Treatment with sodium thiosulfate (STS) and hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy alone was ineffective, forcing the patient to undergo bilateral below the-knee-amputation (BKA) 5 months after presentation. It was not until peritoneal dialysis had been changed to daily hemodialysis, while continuing STS and HBO therapy, that the patient demonstrated complete resolution of CUA on repeat bone scan. Based on these findings, and the extremely high mortality rate associated with this disease, CUA management requires early and aggressive intervention with multi-faceted therapy, including prompt conversion from peritoneal dialysis to hemodialysis, STS infusions and hyperbaric oxygen therapy.","Amin, Nimisha; Gonzalez, Elsa; Lieber, Michael; Salusky, Isidro B.; Zaritsky, Joshua J.",Pediatr Nephrol,99,1

In some patients, axial inflammation leads to irreversible structural damage that in the spine is usually quantified by the modified Stoke Ankylosing Spondylitis Spinal Score (mSASSS). Available therapeutic options include biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs), which have been proven effective in suppressing inflammation in several randomised controlled trials (RCT), the gold standard for evaluating causal treatment effects. RCTs are, however, unfeasible for testing structural effects in axSpA mainly due to the low sensitivity to change of the mSASSS. The available literature therefore mainly includes observational research, which poses serious challenges to the determination of causality. Here, we review the studies testing the effect of bDMARDs on spinal radiographic progression, making use of the principles of causal inference. By exploring the assumptions of causality under counterfactual reasoning (exchangeability, positivity and consistency), we distinguish between studies that likely have reported confounded treatment effects and studies that, on the basis of their design, have more likely reported causal treatment effects. We conclude that bDMARDs might, indirectly, interfere with spinal radiographic progression in axSpA by their effect on inflammation. Innovations in imaging are expected, so that placebo-controlled trials can in the future become a reality. In the meantime, causal inference analysis using observational data may contribute to a better understanding of whether disease modification is possible in axSpA.","Sepriano, Alexandre; Ramiro, Sofia; van der Heijde, Desirée; Landewé, Robert",RMD Open,99,1

The Generation R Study,15.589669,8.681407,2010-02-01,"BACKGROUND: There is a growing global need for scalable approaches to training and supervising primary care workers (PCWs) to deliver mental health services. Over the past decade, the World Health Organization Mental Health Gap Action Programme Intervention Guide (mhGAP-IG) and associated training and implementation guidance have been disseminated to more than 100 countries. On the basis of the opportunities provided by mobile technology, an updated electronic Mental Health Gap Action Programme Intervention Guide (e-mhGAP-IG) is now being developed along with a clinical dashboard and guidance for the use of mobile technology in supervision. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the feasibility, acceptability, adoption, and other implementation parameters of the e-mhGAP-IG for diagnosis and management of depression in 2 lower-middle-income countries (Nepal and Nigeria) and to conduct a feasibility cluster randomized controlled trial (cRCT) to evaluate trial procedures for a subsequent fully powered trial comparing the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the e-mhGAP-IG and remote supervision with standard mhGAP-IG implementation. METHODS: A feasibility cRCT will be conducted in Nepal and Nigeria to evaluate the feasibility of the e-mhGAP-IG for use in depression diagnosis and treatment. In each country, an estimated 20 primary health clinics (PHCs) in Nepal and 6 PHCs in Nigeria will be randomized to have their staff trained in e-mhGAP-IG or the paper version of mhGAP-IG v2.0. The PHC will be the unit of clustering. All PCWs within a facility will receive the same training (e-mhGAP-IG vs paper mhGAP-IG). Approximately 2-5 PCWs, depending on staffing, will be recruited per clinic (estimated 20 health workers per arm in Nepal and 15 per arm in Nigeria). The primary outcomes of interest will be the feasibility and acceptability of training, supervision, and care delivery using the e-mhGAP-IG. Secondary implementation outcomes include the adoption of the e-mhGAP-IG and feasibility of trial procedures. The secondary intervention outcome—and the primary outcome for a subsequent fully powered trial—will be the accurate identification of depression by PCWs. Detection rates before and after training will be compared in each arm. RESULTS: To date, qualitative formative work has been conducted at both sites to prepare for the pilot feasibility cRCT, and the e-mhGAP-IG and remote supervision guidelines have been developed. CONCLUSIONS: The incorporation of mobile digital technology has the potential to improve the scalability of mental health services in primary care and enhance the quality and accuracy of care.

Here, we have investigated the possible active ingredients associated with cancer-related fatigue (CRF) in the Shengqi Fuzheng Injection (SFI). In vitro cell models were used to measure the regulation effects of SFI on CRF. Metabolomic analysis was used to identify the potential genes and pathways in C2C12 mouse myoblasts treated with SFI, and the interaction of compounds and CRF targets was predicted using network pharmacology and molecular docking analyses. The putative pathways were further verified using immuno-blotting assays. The results showed that SFI significantly inhibited muscle cell apoptosis and increased the mitochondrial membrane potential of muscle cells. The network pharmacology analysis results identified 36 candidate compounds, and 244 potential targets were yielded by SFI, and they shared 10 key targets associated with cancer-related fatigue. According to the enrichment analysis and experimental validation, SFI might ameliorate muscle cell mitochondrial function by activating AMPK and inhibiting the PI3K/Akt signaling pathways, and the expression changes of mitochondrial metabolic enzymes MnSOD and apoptosis-associated proteins Bax and Bcl-2 were also triggered. The functions and mechanisms of SFI in anticancer-related fatigue were found here to be at least partly due to the targeting of the AMPK and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways, and this has highlighted new potential applications for network pharmacology when researching Chinese Medicines.","Guo, Wei; Liu, Shan; Zheng, Xinting; Xiao, Zhiwei; Chen, Hanrui; Sun, Lingling; Zhang, Chi; Wang, Zhijie; Lin, Lizhu",Oxid Med Cell Longev,99,1

In response to the changing landscape and needs within the Canadian nephrology research community, an interest in further growth and development of the network was identified. In the following report, we describe the process undertaken to re-envision the network through the creation of 3 new committees and how the committees are facilitating change and growth within the CNTN for future sustainability. SOURCES OF INFORMATION: To understand areas for improvement and capacity building, the organization charged with overseeing the CNTN, Canadians Seeking Solutions and Innovations to Overcome Chronic Kidney Disease (Can-SOLVE CKD), began by conducting an environmental scan. As well, 2 informal surveys were sent to nephrology professionals (who were members of the CNTN and the Canadian Society of Nephrology) and patient partners (from Can-SOLVE CKD). METHODS: In September 2018, 44 CNTN members and other stakeholders from across Canada (including patient partners and representatives from research funding agencies) convened for a 2-day visioning workshop in Mississauga, Ontario. The agenda for this workshop was largely based on the results from the informal surveys. CNTN leadership participated and chose other workshop participants through informal stakeholder mapping and purposeful recruitment. Patient partners were recruited to participate in the workshop through advertisement within the Can-SOLVE-CKD patient council. The survey results and discussion questions were presented to participants at the workshop who, in turn, discussed in large- and small-group session ways in which the CNTN might be expanded. RESULTS: Surveys of patient partners indicated that they would like to see greater involvement of patients in the research process. Surveys of researchers indicated that they wanted more support and resources for coordinating prospective trials. The themes which emerged from the workshop discussions were peer review, engagement, and training. These themes were broadened and formally re-named to Scientific Operations, Communications and Engagement, and Capacity Building. A working committee, each co-led by a nephrologist with research experience and a patient partner, was created to advance each of these identified themes. An executive committee was created to provide overall strategic leadership and governance to the network. The Scientific Operations Committee conducts peer reviews; provides letters of endorsement after peer review; and holds semi-annual in-person meetings where researchers can present their proposals and obtain feedback from multiple stakeholders, including patients. The Communications and Engagement Committee publishes a quarterly newsletter, engages the community on Twitter, and reaches out to community sites and new nephrologists to engage them in research. The Capacity Building Committee conducts webinars to encourage patient partners to develop their own research questions and is developing a hub-and-spoke model to improve research collaboration. LIMITATIONS: We did not conduct formal stakeholder mapping. Only attendees of the visioning workshop provided input, and not everyone’s comment or opinion was included in the workshop report. Perspectives were limited to the sample of people who attended the workshop or were surveyed and may not reflect perspectives of all stakeholders in nephrology research in Canada. We did not use formal qualitative methodology to summarize the workshops. IMPLICATIONS: Renewed areas of focus and related committees within the CNTN could lead to an increased capacity for nephrology research, increased engagement and collaboration with researchers, a higher likelihood of funding with rigorous peer review, and more clinical trials and multicenter collaborative prospective research being conducted in Canada.","Murdoch, Alicia; Tennankore, Karthik K.; Bohm, Clara; Clase, Catherine M.; Levin, Adeera; Vorster, Hans; Suri, Rita S.",Can J Kidney Health Dis,99,1

This meta-analysis aimed to systematically evaluate the cardioprotective effect of dexmedetomidine on cardiac surgery under CPB and its effect on accompanied inflammation. PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE and Web of Science databases were comprehensively searched for all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published before April 1st, 2021 that explored the application of dexmedetomidine in cardiac surgery. Compared with the control group (group C), the concentrations of CK-MB in the perioperative period and cTn-I at 12 h and 24 h after operation in dexmedetomidine group (group D) were significantly decreased (P < 0.05). In addition, in group D, the levels of interleukin-6 at 24 h after operation, tumor necrosis factor-a at the 12 h and 24 h after operation were significantly decreased (P < 0.05). At the same time, the length of Intensive Care Unit stay in group D was significantly shorter than group C (P < 0.05). However, there was no significant difference in interleukin-10 level, C reactive protein level, the time on ventilator and length of hospital stay between the two groups (P > 0.05). The application of dexmedetomidine in cardiac surgery with CPB can reduce CK-MB and cTn-I concentration and interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α levels to a certain extent and shorten the length of Intensive Care Unit stay, but it has no significant effect on IL-10 level, C reactive protein level, the time on ventilator and length of hospital stay.

However, due to lack of body donation programs in Middle Eastern medical schools, dead bodies are imported from abroad. Since literature suggests that the body shortage is influenced by reluctance to donate one's body, this study aimed to determine the perceptions of faculty, staff, and students regarding body donation for educational purposes at a new Dubai-based medical school. An online dually translated questionnaire was administered to the target population (322), of which 150 participants representative of faculty, staff, and students, responded. Although 111 (74.0 %) of participants considered body donation to be appropriate for educational and research purposes, only 44 (29.3 %) of participants expressed willingness to donate their bodies. Reluctance to donate 106 (70.7 %) appeared to be mostly influenced by religion, psychological barrier, and familial reasons. The emergence of four themes (i.e., resource, barrier, humanitarian, and awareness) and the identification of a potential donor group within the group that was willing to donate provided insight into the level of awareness within the university community. Furthermore, such findings may assist to establish future body donation programs and strategize recruitment approaches, especially when there is an ensuing dearth of anatomical donations.","Naidoo, Nerissa; Al-Sharif, Ghadah A.; Khan, Raeesa; Azar, Aida; Omer, Amar",Heliyon,99,1

DESIGN: A qualitative study of indepth interviews using interpretative phenomenological analysis. PRIMARY OUTCOME: Main meaning-making processes of participants’ experience. SETTINGS: Participants were recruited through two associations of people affected by meningitis and their family ascendants. PARTICIPANTS: Convenience sampling of 11 women whose children or grandchildren were between 0.2 and 20 years old at the time of their meningitis diagnosis (M=4.06, SD=7.3). On average, 9.39 (SD=5.4) years had passed between the onset of illness and the interview. RESULTS: Six superordinate themes (meningitis disease; healthcare services and professionals; knowledge/ignorance; repercussions of the meningitis experience: ‘life afterwards’; sick child attitudes/behaviour; and sibling attitudes/behaviour) and two main meaning-making processes in relation to participants’ experience of meningitis were identified: (1) the sick child becoming a ‘hero’: comparison with other children; and (2) engaging action/attitude: finding the ‘positive’ of the traumatic experience and engaging action to improve the care system. These two processes underpin the psychological adjustment to meningitis and its consequences. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a unique insight into close family members’ first-hand experience with acute bacterial meningitis. Findings highlighted factors characterising the disease experience, the psychological adjustment of meningitis survivors’ families and their meaning-making processes. These findings are important for research and clinical practice, demonstrating the multidimensional impact of the disease on family ascendants, their need for professional psychological support and the importance of direct involvement of parents in identifying key aspects of care.","Scanferla, Elisabetta; Gorwood, Philip; Fasse, Léonor",BMJ Open,99,1

Additional functionality is conferred on the probability density and hazard rate functions, improving their peak, asymmetry, tail, and flatness levels. These characteristics are represented analytically and graphically with three special distributions of the family derived from the exponential, Rayleigh, and Lindley distributions. Subsequently, we conducted asymptotic, first-order stochastic dominance, series expansion, Tsallis entropy, and moment studies. Useful risk measures were also investigated. The remainder of the study was devoted to the statistical use of the associated models. In particular, we developed an adapted maximum likelihood methodology aiming to efficiently estimate the model parameters. The special distribution extending the exponential distribution was applied as a statistical model to fit two sets of actuarial and financial data. It performed better than a wide variety of selected competing non-nested models. Numerical applications for risk measures are also given.","Bantan, Rashad A.

For example, water-soluble DNIC [Fe(2)(μ-SCH(2)CH(2)OH)(2)(NO)(4)] (DNIC-1) was explored for oral delivery of NO to the brain and for the activation of hippocampal neurogenesis. However, the kinetics and mechanism for cellular uptake and intracellular release of NO, as well as the biocompatibility of synthetic DNICs, remain elusive. Prompted by the potential application of NO to dermato-physiological regulations, in this study, cellular uptake and intracellular delivery of DNIC [Fe(2)(μ-SCH(2)CH(2)COOH)(2)(NO)(4)] (DNIC-2) and its regulatory effect/biocompatibility toward epidermal cells were investigated. Upon the treatment of DNIC-2 to human fibroblast cells, cellular uptake of DNIC-2 followed by transformation into protein-bound DNICs occur to trigger the intracellular release of NO with a half-life of 1.8 ± 0.2 h. As opposed to the burst release of extracellular NO from diethylamine NONOate (DEANO), the cell-penetrating nature of DNIC-2 rationalizes its overwhelming efficacy for intracellular delivery of NO. Moreover, NO-delivery DNIC-2 can regulate cell proliferation, accelerate wound healing, and enhance the deposition of collagen in human fibroblast cells. Based on the in vitro and in vivo biocompatibility evaluation, biocompatible DNIC-2 holds the potential to be a novel active ingredient for skincare products.","Chen, Yu-Chieh; Chen, Yi-Hong; Chiu, Han; Ko, Yi-Hsuan; Wang, Ruei-Ting; Wang, Wei-Ping; Chuang, Yung-Jen; Huang, Chieh-Cheng; Lu, Tsai-Te",Int J Mol Sci,99,1

In 2015, the paediatric specific definition, Paediatric Acute Lung Injury Consensus Conference (PALICC) was developed. The use of non-invasive metrics of oxygenation to stratify disease severity were introduced in this definition, although this potentially may lead to a confounding effect of disease severity since it is more common to place indwelling arterial lines in sicker patients. We tested the hypothesis that PALICC outperforms AECC/BD in our high acuity PICU, which employs a liberal use of indwelling arterial lines and high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV). METHODS: We retrospectively collected data from children < 18 years mechanically ventilated for at least 24 h in our tertiary care, university-affiliated paediatric intensive care unit. The primary endpoint was the difference in the number of PARDS cases between AECC/BD and PALICC. Secondary endpoints included mortality and ventilator free days. Performance was assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC-ROC). RESULTS: Data from 909 out of 2433 patients was eligible for analysis. AECC/BD identified 35 (1.4%) patients (mortality 25.7%), whereas PALICC identified 135 (5.5%) patients (mortality 14.1%). All but two patients meeting AECC/Berlin criteria were also identified by PALICC. Almost half of the cohort (45.2%) had mild, 33.3% moderate and 21.5% severe PALICC PARDS at onset. Highest mortality rates were seen in patients with AECC acute lung injury (ALI)/mild Berlin and severe PALICC PARDS. The AUC-ROC for Berlin was the highest 24 h (0.392 [0.124–0.659]) after onset. PALICC showed the highest AUC-ROC at the same moment however higher than Berlin (0.531 [0.345–0.716]). Mortality rates were significantly increased in patients with bilateral consolidations (9.3% unilateral vs 26.3% bilateral, p = 0.025). CONCLUSIONS: PALICC identified more new cases PARDS than the AECC/Berlin definition. However, both PALICC and Berlin performed poorly in terms of mortality risk stratification. The presence of bilateral consolidations was associated with a higher mortality rate. Our findings may be considered in future modifications of the PALICC criteria.

Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were used to assess test-retest reliability of measures of sensory (auditory and visual) ERPs and performance, for the two experimental conditions. To assess the degree of reliability of the variability of responses within individuals, this analysis was performed on the variance of the measurements, in addition to their means. This yielded a total of 24 measures for which ICCs were calculated. RESULTS: The data yielded significant good ICC values for 10 of the 24 measurements. These spanned across behavioral and ERPs data, experimental conditions, and mean as well as variance measures. Measures of the visual evoked responses accounted for a disproportionately large number of the significant ICCs; follow-up analyses suggested that the contribution of a greater number of trials to the visual compared to the auditory ERP partially accounted for this. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis reveals that sensory ERPs and related behavior can be highly reliable across multiple measurement time-points in ASD. The data further suggest that the inter-trial and inter-participant variability reported in the ASD literature likely represents replicable individual participant neural processing differences. The stability of these neuronal readouts supports their use as biomarkers in clinical and translational studies on ASD. Given the minimum interval between test/retest sessions across our cohort, we also conclude that for the tested age-range of ~ 6 to 9.4 years, these reliability measures are valid for at least a 3-month interval. Limitations related to EEG task demands and study length in the context of a clinical trial are considered.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the patient participation related to their own care among patients with multimorbidity in primary health‐care settings. METHODS: A cross‐sectional survey was conducted among adult multimorbid patients who visited primary health‐care facilities. The key instrument used was the Participation in Rehabilitation Questionnaire. Data representing 125 patients were analysed using various statistical methods. RESULTS: The respondents generally felt patient participation to be important, yet provided highly varying accounts regarding the extent to which it was realized by professionals. Information and knowledge and Respect and encouragement were considered the most important and best implemented subcategories of participation. Several patient‐related factors had a statistically significant effect on patient perceptions of participation for all subcategories and as explanatory factors for perceptions of total participation in univariate models. Most patients reported active participation in health‐care communication, positively associated with patient activation and adherence. Gender, perceived health, patient activation and active participation were explanatory factors for total importance of participation in multivariate models, while patient activation was retained for realization of participation. CONCLUSIONS: Multimorbid patients require individualized care that promotes participation and active communication; this approach may further improve patient activation and adherence. Poor perceived health and functional ability seemed to be related to worse perceptions of participation. PATIENT AND PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT: The study topic importance was based on the patients' experiences in author's previous research and the need to develop patient‐centred care.","Paukkonen, Leila; Oikarinen, Anne; Kähkönen, Outi; Kyngäs, Helvi",Health Expect,99,1

The appropriate investigational technique, specific differential diagnoses, and particular risks of these patients need to be understood by referring physicians as well as by radiologists. Thus, communication and cooperation, also including other clinical disciplines such as pulmonology, are required. Early detection of an infectious focus is the major goal in febrile neutropenic patients. As pneumonia is the most common focus, chest imaging is a special radiological task. The sensitivity of chest x-ray, especially in supine position, is low. Therefore, the very sensitive thin-section multislice CT became a gold standard in neutropenic hosts and might be cost effective in comparison to antibiotic treatment. CT-based localization can be used to guide invasive procedures in order to obtain samples for microbiological workup. Furthermore, the radiological characterization of infiltrates gives a first and rapid hint to discriminate between infectious (viral, typical bacterial, atypical bacterial, fungal) and noninfectious etiologies. Radiological follow-up has to take into account aspects according to disease, immune recovery, and treatment modalities. Due to a high incidence of fungal-related lung infiltrates, interpretation of follow-up findings must include further parameters besides lesion size. Apart from the lungs, also other organ systems such as the brain, liver, and paranasal sinuses need attention and are to be imaged with the appropriate technique.","Heussel, Claus Peter",Infections in Hematology,99,1

These events, in the context of an instantaneous global-media world, have placed an unprecedented emphasis on preparing for a human influenza pandemic [5, 6]. Although some argue that the media have exaggerated the threat, the warnings of an impending pandemic are not without foundation given the history of past influenza pandemics [7], incidence of H5N1 infections among humans [8], and the potential impact of a pandemic. Reports of the 1918 pandemic vary, but most suggested that approximately one third of the world’s population was infected with 50 to 100 million deaths [9]. Computer modeling of a moderate pandemic, less severe then in 1918, in the province of Ontario, Canada predicts 73,252 admissions of influenza patients to hospitals over a 6-week period utilizing 72% of the hospital capacity, 171% of intensive care unit (ICU) capacity, and 118% of current ventilator capacity. Pandemic modeling by the Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society also showed that critical care resources would be overwhelmed by even a moderate pandemic [10].

The vital role medical practitioners play is reflected globally in the obligation under health legislation for medical practitioners to notify the public health authority of specific details of named patients suspected of having these diseases. While the principle is universal that the notification include the identity of the patient, to allow prompt and direct public health action, if needed, jurisdictions have varying approaches to many other aspects of notification: the actual list of notifiable conditions; who must notify and based on what degree of diagnostic certainty; in what timeframe and with what specific details; what information is to be provided to the case; and who bears responsibility for contact tracing. In addition, in some jurisdictions, medical practitioners have associated statutory obligations and powers, related to the examination of a patient directed for assessment by the public health authority, the furnishing of reports of such examinations, the role of the practitioner in ordering a patient into isolation, and responsibilities of medical practitioners in public health emergencies.

Some of the viral diseases can be cured by approved antiviral drugs, but for others still do not have any vaccines or drugs available. Most of the approved antiviral drugs are somehow directly or indirectly associated with side effects, which eventually raise the need for the development of antivirals based on natural phytochemicals. Globally, the development of antivirals is shifting towards the plant-derived products as they are less toxic and has less chance to develop resistance. Phytochemicals have been exploited traditionally for the cure of many diseases, and also have been reported to inhibit viral replication/transcription. Most of them inhibit the viruses either during the viral entry inside the host cell or during their replication. Moreover, 50% of the drugs derived from plants are being used in the Western nations. Plants have a variety of phytochemicals like flavonoids, terpenoids, lignins, alkaloids, and coumarins that are having antioxidant activity, and help to inhibit viral genome. Various plant-derived products have been well studied against viruses like herpes virus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), influenza, and hepatitis virus. More recently, Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by a newly identified coronavirus has become pandemic, and affected world’s population severely.

In addressing those themes the chapter revisits some of the central arguments presented in the introductory chapter about the urgency and the challenges of enhancing the effectiveness of climate change education, and some of the key conclusions of critical reviews of the literature on education and climate change about the limitation of existing approaches to the subject. Those themes are: Educating students to address climate change is about engaging them in active problem solving, not contemplation. While learning from doing is valuable, to advance the field of climate change education, it is necessary to conceptualize and theorize practice. The need to think broadly about learning outcomes in climate change education. The power of contextually situated learning. A Signature project-based pedagogy to Change Climate through Education. Augmenting the capacity for climate change education among teachers and schools. The limitations of infusing climate change education in existing courses.

The objective of this study was to determine whether age is independently associated with mortality in older adults hospitalized with COVID-19. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of adults age 65+ with confirmed COVID-19 hospitalized in the greater NY metropolitan area between 3/1/20-4/20/20. Primary outcome was in-hospital mortality, with age as the primary predictor. Multivariate logistic regression was used to evaluate association between age and in-hospital mortality after controlling for demographics, severity of acute illness, comorbidities, and baseline function, cognition, and life-sustaining treatment preferences. 4,969 patients were included, average age 77.3, 56.0% male, 46.8% White, 20.8% African American, 15.1% Hispanic.

However, rare diseases are commonly neglected due to insufficient data. Here, we demonstrate that few-shot learning (FSL) using a generative adversarial network (GAN) can improve the applicability of DL in the optical coherence tomography (OCT) diagnosis of rare diseases. Four major classes with a large number of datasets and five rare disease classes with a few-shot dataset are included in this study. Before training the classifier, we constructed GAN models to generate pathological OCT images of each rare disease from normal OCT images. The Inception-v3 architecture was trained using an augmented training dataset, and the final model was validated using an independent test dataset. The synthetic images helped in the extraction of the characteristic features of each rare disease. The proposed DL model demonstrated a significant improvement in the accuracy of the OCT diagnosis of rare retinal diseases and outperformed the traditional DL models, Siamese network, and prototypical network. By increasing the accuracy of diagnosing rare retinal diseases through FSL, clinicians can avoid neglecting rare diseases with DL assistance, thereby reducing diagnosis delay and patient burden.

We sought to determine the association of obesity and other clinical factors with outcomes among patients hospitalized for severe coronavirus disease (COVID-19). This study included patients hospitalized between March 1, 2020 and September 17, 2020 in a 5-hospital health care system in Northeast United States, who had a positive RT-PCR assay of nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 performed during hospitalization. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated using admission weight and height, and the WHO classification was used to define obesity. Both bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to determine the association of obesity and other clinical parameters with mortality (defined as in-hospital death or transition to hospice care) and intensive care use (defined by transfer to intensive care unit [ICU]). Multivariate model was adjusted for demographics and 8 pertinent comorbidities. Among 3246 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, median age was 65 years (interquartile range, 51–78), 49.9% were female, 30.5% overweight, and 43.2% had obesity (20.8%, 12.1%, and 10.4% with class I, II, and III obesity, respectively). A total of 542 (16.7%) patients died or received hospice care, and 811 (25.0%) required ICU care. In unadjusted analyses, patients with obesity had lower mortality compared with normal weight adults (13.0% vs. 23.1%) but a higher risk of ICU care (26.5% vs. 22.5%) and longer duration of ICU stays (9.5±10.6 vs. 6.6±8.5 [days]; all p-values <0.05). Obesity was associated with a higher incidence of hypoxic respiratory failure requiring invasive (17.8% vs. 9.3%) and noninvasive (22.7% vs. 14.0%) ventilatory support. In multivariate analysis, older age, male sex, and diabetes were significantly associated with both mortality and ICU care. In contrast, obesity was not associated with a significantly higher mortality (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.14; 95% CI, 0.91–1.43) but was associated with a higher risk of ICU care (OR 1.27; 95% CI 1.07–1.51 for all obesity and OR 2.07; 95% CI 1.51–2.82 for class III obesity compared with normal weight). The association of underweight with mortality (OR 1.56; 95% CI 0.93 - 2.60) and ICU care (OR 1.20; 95% CI, 0.71–1.99) was not statistically significant. This retrospective study of hospitalized patients suggests that obesity is associated with intensive care use and longer duration of ICU stay but not with mortality due to COVID-19. These findings underscore the vulnerability of individuals with obesity during the current pandemic.","Kang, Yu Mi; Brancale, Joseph; Athonvarangkul, Diana; Alausa, Jameel; Subair, Labeebah; Lipska, Kasia Joanna; Jastreboff, Ania M",J Endocr Soc,99,1

We cross-sectionally investigated body composition, risk of fall and circulating osteocalcin (OC) isoforms in osteoporotic postmenopausal women to test the hypothesis of an involvement of OC in the bone-muscle crosstalk. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-nine non-diabetic, non-obese, postmenopausal osteoporotic women (age 72.4 ± 6.8 years; BMI 23.0 ± 3.3 kg/m(2)) underwent to: 1) fasting blood sampling for biochemical and hormone assays, including carboxylated (cOC) and uncarboxylated (uOC) osteocalcin; 2) whole-body dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) to assess total and regional body composition; 3) magnetic resonance imaging to determine cross-sectional muscle area (CSA) and intermuscular adipose tissue (IMAT) of thigh muscles; 4) risk of fall assessment through the OAK system. RESULTS: Appendicular skeletal muscle index (ASMMI) was low in 45% of patients. Forty percent got a low OAK score, consistent with moderate-severe risk of fall, which was predicted by low legs lean mass and increased total fat mass. Circulating cOC levels showed significantly correlated with βCTx-I, lean mass parameters including IMAT, and OAK score. Fractured and unfractured women did not differ for any of the analyzed parameters, though cOC and uOC positively correlated with legs lean mass, OAK score and bone markers only in fractured women. CONCLUSIONS: Data supported the relationship between OC and skeletal muscle mass and function in postmenopausal osteoporotic women. Serum cOC, but not uOC, emerges as mediator in the bone-muscle crosstalk. Circulating cOC and uOC levels may be differentially regulated in fractured and unfractured osteoporotic women, suggesting underlying differences in bone metabolism.","Vitale, Jacopo Antonino; Sansoni, Veronica; Faraldi, Martina; Messina, Carmelo; Verdelli, Chiara; Lombardi, Giovanni; Corbetta, Sabrina",Front Endocrinol (Lausanne),99,12

Thus, to overcome this issue, several new definitions of fractional derivatives have been introduced. The Caputo–Fabrizio fractional order is one of these nonsingular definitions. This paper is concerned with the analyses and design of an optimal control strategy for a Caputo–Fabrizio fractional-order model of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. The Caputo–Fabrizio fractional-order model of HIV/AIDS is considered to prevent the singularity problem, which is a real concern in the modeling of real-world systems and phenomena. Firstly, in order to find out how the population of each compartment can be controlled, sensitivity analyses were conducted. Based on the sensitivity analyses, the most effective agents in disease transmission and prevalence were selected as control inputs. In this way, a modified Caputo–Fabrizio fractional-order model of the HIV/AIDS epidemic is proposed. By changing the contact rate of susceptible and infectious people, the atraumatic restorative treatment rate of the treated compartment individuals, and the sexual habits of susceptible people, optimal control was designed. Lastly, simulation results that demonstrate the appropriate performance of the Caputo–Fabrizio fractional-order model and proposed control scheme are illustrated.","Wang, Hua; Jahanshahi, Hadi; Wang, Miao-Kun; Bekiros, Stelios; Liu, Jinping; Aly, Ayman A.",Entropy (Basel),99,1

We consider two main effects: climate induced seasonality and recruitment. The latter is introduced as a way to palliate for the absence of a spatial component in the SIR model. In our approach we mimic the spatial evolution of the epidemic through a gradual introduction of susceptible individuals. We apply our model to the case of France and Australia and explain the appearance of two temporally well-separated epidemic waves. We examine also Brazil and the USA, which present patterns very different from those of the European countries. We show that with our model it is possible to reproduce the observed patterns in these two countries thanks to simple recruitment assumptions. Finally, in order to show the power of the recruitment approach, we simulate the case of the 1918 influenza epidemic reproducing successfully the, by now famous, three epidemic peaks.","Nakamura, Gilberto; Grammaticos, Basil; Badoual, Mathilde",Regul,99,1

As part of the COVID-19 pandemic, we carried out in situ simulation for anaesthesiologists and operating room (OR) nurses. Simulation was focused on the recommendations on the use of specific personal protective equipment (PPE) as well as on airway management and intubation. We hypothesised that in situ procedural simulation should increase their perceived self-efficacy. METHODS: Between 16 March and 20 March 2020, 208 healthcare workers took part in in situ procedural simulation. A questionnaire was sent to participants on 21 April 2020. Six self-efficacy items related to PPE and airway manoeuvres were assessed before and after training on a Numeric Rating Scale from 0 to 10. RESULTS: Sixty-seven participants (32%) replied to the questionnaire. The before–after comparison of the six items revealed an increase in perceived self-efficacy for each of them. A before training difference was observed between nurses, board-certified anaesthetists and trainees in anaesthesia in perceived self-efficacy for putting on (6 (3–8) vs 4.5 (2.25–6) vs 2 (0–6), p=0.007) and remove PPE (8 (5–8) vs 4.5 (3.25–6) vs 4 (1–6), p=0.009). No difference in perceived self-efficacy after training was observed between nurses, board-certified anaesthetists and trainees in anaesthesia. CONCLUSIONS: In situ simulation improves the perceived self-efficacy of OR nurses and anaesthesiologists on specific skills related to the care of patients with COVID-19.","Lois, Fernande; Hallet, Claude; Samalea Suarez, Nicolas; Ghuysen, Alexandre; Brichant, Jean François",BMJ Simul Technol Enhanc Learn,99,33

Montmorillonite clays have been shown to tightly bind diverse toxic chemicals. Due to their promise as sorbents to mitigate chemical exposures, it is important to understand their function and rapidly screen and predict optimal clay–chemical combinations for further testing. We derived adsorption free-energy values for a structurally and physicochemically diverse set of toxic chemicals using experimental adsorption isotherms performed in the current and previous studies. We studied the diverse set of chemicals using minimalistic MD simulations and showed that their interaction energies with calcium montmorillonite clays calculated using simulation snapshots in combination with their net charge and their corresponding solvent’s dielectric constant can be used as inputs to a minimalistic model to predict adsorption free energies in agreement with experiments. Additionally, experiments and computations were used to reveal structural and physicochemical properties associated with chemicals that can be adsorbed to calcium montmorillonite clay. These properties include positively charged groups, phosphine groups, halide-rich moieties, hydrogen bond donor/acceptors, and large, rigid structures. The combined experimental and computational approaches used in this study highlight the importance and potential applicability of analogous methods to study and design novel advanced sorbent systems in the future, broadening their applicability for environmental contaminants.","Orr, Asuka A.; Wang, Meichen; Beykal, Burcu; Ganesh, Hari S.; Hearon, Sara E.; Pistikopoulos, Efstratios N.; Phillips, Timothy D.; Tamamis, Phanourios",ACS Omega,99,26

Outbreak of the COVID‐19 pandemic disrupted our original plans for the Internship Program in summer 2020; thus, we redesigned the Program as a remote internship focusing on science reading, writing, and interpretation skills in order to continue providing an authentic research experience for our high school interns. During the first three years of the Program, we focused on hands‐on participation in physiology research to expose students to an academic research environment and to explore mechanisms for mentoring students in early phases of the STEM pipeline. As we planned for our fourth summer, we originally aimed to expand the Program by increasing the number of high school students placed in research labs at Sac State. With on‐campus research severely limited due to COVID‐19, we instead worked with the mentoring professors at Sac State to pivot the Program's emphases and create a remote internship experience. Feedback gathered from previous student interns indicated their desire to be more involved in the entire scientific process and learn how to read, write, analyze, and communicate data for a scientific audience. We embraced the unexpected turn of events due to the COVID‐19 pandemic as an opportunity to focus on these skills and continue providing authentic research experiences, even if we were not able to conduct traditional, hands‐on laboratory research with the student interns. Three Sac State mentors and five student interns participated in the remote version of the Internship Program in summer of 2020. Student interns participated in a wide range of training activities, including the following: quantitative data analysis, statistics and computer coding tutorials, strategies for reading scientific manuscripts, journal club presentations, protocol development, writing funding proposals, literature search techniques to develop new lines of inquiry, and oral communication of science. At the conclusion of the Program, informal feedback from the student interns indicated general satisfaction with the remote internship model; they valued the opportunity to learn and practice science reading, writing, and interpretation skills and felt they were truly members of their research teams. However, they also commented their research experiences were not as impactful as they could have been, since they could not conduct hands‐on experiments in the laboratory. For future iterations of our Internship Program, either in‐person or remote, including a component that emphasizes science reading, writing, and interpretation skills merits consideration based on positive feedback from the initial pilot of this component during our pivot to a remote internship model due to COVID‐19.","Altman, Robin; Vivaik, Pragathi; Kaschner, Meghan; Whited, Kellie",FASEB J,99,22

The paper presents a qualitative perspective on existing challenges faced by social marketing and offers suggestions for addressing these challenges. Nine semi-structured interviews with social marketing academics and practitioners from six different countries were conducted. Thematic analysis was used to analyse and interpret the qualitative data. The study provides insight into existing challenges for social marketing, classified into three key themes according to their position within or outside of the discipline: 1) poor branding of the discipline as an internal challenge, 2) competing disciplines as an external challenge, and 3) overall reach of the discipline, seen as both an internal and external challenge. The findings suggest that social marketing needs to overcome poor branding issues to sufficiently address external challenges. We conclude by arguing for a more robust marketing of the discipline. While scholars have identified the challenges and opportunities for social marketing as a discipline, they have paid little attention to examining these challenges from the viewpoint of expert practitioners and academics. This paper presents a nuanced contextual understanding of the identified challenges through a qualitative perspective and explores how social marketing can overcome these challenges.","Akbar, M.

In such an experiment, each molecule from a large small-molecule drug library is evaluated in terms of physical properties such as the docking score against a target receptor. In real-life drug discovery experiments, drug libraries are extremely large but still there is only a minor representation of the essentially infinite chemical space, and evaluation of physical properties for each molecule in the library is not computationally feasible. In the current study, a novel Machine learning framework for Enhanced MolEcular Screening (MEMES) based on Bayesian optimization is proposed for efficient sampling of the chemical space. The proposed framework is demonstrated to identify 90% of the top-1000 molecules from a molecular library of size about 100 million, while calculating the docking score only for about 6% of the complete library. We believe that such a framework would tremendously help to reduce the computational effort in not only drug-discovery but also areas that require such high-throughput experiments.","Mehta, Sarvesh; Laghuvarapu, Siddhartha; Pathak, Yashaswi; Sethi, Aaftaab; Alvala, Mallika; Priyakumar, U.

Indeed, the cerebellum is no longer considered merely as the locus of motor coordination and its learning. Here, we introduce the mechanisms underlying the induction of multiple types of plasticity in cerebellar circuit and give an overview focusing on the plasticity of non-synaptic intrinsic excitability. The discovery of long-term potentiation of synaptic responsiveness in hippocampal neurons led investigations into changes of their intrinsic excitability. This activity-dependent potentiation of neuronal excitability is distinct from that of synaptic efficacy. Systematic examination of excitability plasticity has indicated that the modulation of various types of Ca2+ - and voltage-dependent K+ -channels underlies the phenomenon, which is also triggered by immune activity. Intrinsic plasticity is expressed specifically on dendrites and modifies the integrative processing and filtering effect. In Purkinje cells, modulation of the discordance of synaptic current on soma and dendrite suggested a novel type of cellular learning mechanism. This property enables a plausible synergy between synaptic efficacy and intrinsic excitability, by amplifying electrical conductivity and influencing the polarity of bidirectional synaptic plasticity. Furthermore, the induction of intrinsic plasticity in the cerebellum correlates with motor performance and cognitive processes, through functional connections from the cerebellar nuclei to neocortex and associated regions: e.g., thalamus and midbrain. Taken together, recent advances in neuroscience have begun to shed light on the complex functioning of non-synaptic excitability and the synergy.","Ohtsuki, Gen; Shishikura, Mari; Ozaki, Akitoshi",The FEBS journal,99,1

Survival of these patients was followed for 5 years, and prognostic factors were identified. RESULTS Cumulative survival rates were 81.4% at 6 months, 79.0% at 1 year, 67.2% at 2 years, and 45.7% at 5 years. Independent prognostic factors influencing both 1- and 5-year survival rates were age, previous lung disease, and disposition after discharge. For 5-year survival, renal disease was also an independent risk factor. DISCUSSION The mortality rate of ARDS survivors after intensive care unit discharge is still high in Taiwan. Three independent risk factors were found to affect the overall survival of these patients.","Chen, Hui-Chuan; Wu, Huey-Dong; Liu, Hsiang-Wen; Chang, Hong-Jer; Lee, Ming-Der; Huang, Pei-Yu; Kuo, Ping-Hung",Nursing research,99,27

When to start delayed abdominal closure and how to determine which delayed closure method should be applied to each OA patient are not clarified in the literature. We evaluated an algorithm that was developed to address these two questions. A retrospective chart review was conducted for OA patients treated for according to the algorithm. When hemodynamic stabilization and source control using negative pressure therapy resulted in regression of sepsis and decreased procalcitonin levels, patients were assigned to either the skin-only or fascial closure groups according to their Björck scores and open abdominal fascial closure (OAFC) scores. The novel OAFC scoring system was created by adding age and malignancy to the sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score. For skin-only closure, skin flaps and skin grafts were used; for fascial closure, an abdominal re-approximation anchor system (ABRA) or ABRA plus biologic mesh was applied. From January 2008 through September 2014, 108 OA patients were managed based on the algorithm; 61 were included in this study. Abdominal closure rate was 90.2 % (55/61). Overall hospital mortality rate was 11.4 % (7/61). Small hernias developed in only 12.5 % (4/32) of the fascial closure group. In this retrospective study, the algorithm with the novel OAFC score provided practical and valid guidance to clarify when to start delayed abdominal closure and which delayed closure method to use for each OA patient.","Yetisir, Fahri; Sarer, A Ebru; Acar, Hasan Zafer; Aygar, Muhittin",The Indian journal of surgery,99,1

AIMS: This randomized, placebo-controlled, proof-of-concept study (NCT02327013) evaluated the efficacy of a multimodal antidepressant, vortioxetine, in the treatment of ADHD, using a two-stage sequential parallel comparison design. METHODS: Patients aged 18-55 years with a diagnosis of ADHD (DSM-5) and a total score ⩾24 on the Adult ADHD Investigator Symptom Rating Scale (AISRS) were randomized in study stage I with a 1:1:3 ratio to six weeks of treatment with vortioxetine 10 or 20 mg/day, or placebo ( n = 227). In study stage II, placebo non-responders (AISRS total score reduction <30% from stage I baseline) were re-randomized with a 1:1:1 ratio to six weeks of vortioxetine 10 or 20 mg/day, or placebo ( n = 59). RESULTS: Across the two study stages combined, ADHD symptoms improved by approximately eight AISRS points in all treatment groups, showing no difference from placebo for either dose of vortioxetine, the study thus failing to meet its primary endpoint. However, both doses of vortioxetine separated from placebo in improving overall patient functioning, as measured by the Sheehan Disability Scale. CONCLUSION: Studies are warranted to further investigate this suggested benefit of a multimodal antidepressant for patient functioning in ADHD while addressing issues of non-adherence and placebo response. The study confirmed vortioxetine 10 mg and 20 mg as generally well-tolerated.","Biederman, Joseph; Lindsten, Annika; Sluth, Lasse B; Petersen, Maria Louise; Ettrup, Anders; Eriksen, Hanne-Lise F; Fava, Maurizio",Journal of psychopharmacology,99,12

This study, conducted in the midst of the crisis, explores the level of COVID-19-related anxieties and parenting stress of Israeli parents in their first year of parenthood. METHODS First-time mothers (n = 469) and fathers (n = 137), aged 21-50, completed self-report questionnaires in April, 2020. They were divided into two groups: parents of younger infants (aged 3-6 months); parents of older infants (aged 7-12 months). RESULTS The levels of all COVID-19-related anxieties were quite high, with the greatest concern aroused by public transportation and public places, followed by concerns over the possible infection of family members and the infant, going for infant check-ups, getting the virus themselves, and the health of the infant. In both groups, mothers reported higher COVID-19-related anxieties than fathers. Fathers of older infants reported higher parenting stress than mothers. DISCUSSION The results highlight the need to be attentive to the double stress of new parents in the first year of parenthood in a time of crisis, and to the potentially greater vulnerability of fathers of older infants.","Ben-Yaakov, Ofir; Ben-Ari, Orit Taubman",Psychology & health,99,31

Besides the ligand-inducible IFNAR1 degradation, the existence of an ""inside-out"" signaling that accelerates IFNAR1 turnover in the cells undergoing the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and activated unfolded protein responses has been recently described. The latter pathway does not require either presence of ligands (IFNα/β) or catalytic activity of Janus kinases (JAK). Instead, this pathway relies on activation of the PKR-like ER kinase (PERK) and ensuing specific priming phosphorylation of IFNAR1. Here, we describe studies that identify the stress activated p38 protein kinase as an important regulator of IFNAR1 that acts downstream of PERK. Results of the experiments using pharmacologic p38 kinase inhibitors, RNA interference approach, and cells from p38α knock-out mice suggest that p38 kinase activity is required for priming phosphorylation of IFNAR1 in cells undergoing unfolded protein response. We further demonstrate an important role of p38 kinase in the ligand-independent stimulation of IFNAR1 ubiquitination and degradation and ensuing attenuation of IFNα/β signaling and anti-viral defenses. We discuss the distinct importance of p38 kinase in regulating the overall responses to type I IFN in cells that have been already exposed to IFNα/β versus those cells that are yet to encounter these cytokines.","Bhattacharya, Sabyasachi; Qian, Juan; Tzimas, Christos; Baker, Darren P; Koumenis, Constantinos; Diehl, J Alan; Fuchs, Serge Y",The Journal of biological chemistry,99,12

Participants completed electronic questionnaires at 06:30 h, 16:00 h and 21:00 h for seven days. Ninety-six respondents participated. Among these, 70 were students (73.7%; of which 65.7% were 18-25 years of age, the remainder being 26 years old or more) and 25 nonstudents (26.3%; all 26 years old or more), with one person neglecting to report such status. A total of 24 (25.0%) respondents had full-time jobs during the data collection, 51 (53.1%) had a part-time job, and 21 (21.9%) did not have a job. There was significant difference between times of day for positive affect, autonomy frustration, and competence frustration. This included an increase in positive affect from morning to afternoon, and reduction in autonomy frustration and competence frustration from afternoon to evening. Chronotype was not related to the daily variations in the studies psychological variables. We conclude that although there are some intra-daily variations in some of the basic needs, these are not as strong as those seen for positive affect, in terms of consistency across several days.","Saksvik-Lehouillier, Ingvild; Nordhaug, Lisa; Owesen, Stine Marie; Karlsen, Håvard R",Chronobiology international,99,1

Advances in anaesthesia and minimally invasive surgery have led to day case treatment being adopted by some centres. The objective of this study is to describe our day case pathway and peri- and postoperative outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS This is a single centre, retrospective case series review of a prospectively collected database from October 2014 to August 2019 performed in a tertiary centre for upper gastrointestinal surgery. Data collected included demographics, comorbidities, indications, complications, length of stay and readmission. RESULTS A total of 362 patients underwent laparoscopic anti-reflux surgery with or without hiatus hernia repair of up to 10cm, with day case rates of 59%. Unplanned admission following day surgery was 5.1% (13/225) and 30-day readmission was 2.2% (8/362); 90.6% of patients remained in hospital for less than 24 hours. There was one intraoperative complication and one patient required revisional surgery within 30 days. The rate of all postoperative complications was 1.38% (5/362) with one postoperative mortality. DISCUSSION The inclusion of larger hernias is unusual, as most studies limit size to 5cm or less. Our results show the safety and feasibility of the procedure even when applied to hiatus hernias up to 10cm. Success was multifactorial and based on standardisation of procedures and support from dedicated specialist nursing staff. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic anti-reflux surgery can be performed safely as a day case procedure even in larger hiatus hernias, with a dedicated care pathway and specialist nurse practitioners to support it.","Mayo, D; Darbyshire, A; Mercer, S; Carter, N; Toh, S; Somers, S; Wainwright, D; Fajksova, V; Knight, B",Annals of the Royal College of Surgeons of England,99,8

State-of-the-art optical flow tracking velocimetry and shadowgraphy measurements are employed to quantitatively measure the flow velocity, trajectories and size distribution of droplets produced during a dental scaling process. The droplet sizes are found to vary from 5 µm to 300 µm; these correspond to droplet nuclei that could carry viruses. The droplet velocities also vary between 1.3 m s-1 and 2.6 m s-1. These observations confirm the critical role of aerosols in the transmission of disease during dental procedures, and provide invaluable knowledge for developing protocols and procedures to ensure the safety of both dentists and patients.","Mirbod, Parisa; Haffner, Eileen A; Bagheri, Maryam; Higham, Jonathan E","Journal of the Royal Society, Interface",99,19

Currently, there is no consensus on effective treatment modalities for immunodeficient CRS patients. This review aims to evaluate the existing evidence on the treatment outcomes and its limitations in patients with CRS and immunodeficiency. METHODS MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) were searched from inception to April 2019 for studies reporting measurable medical or surgical treatment outcomes for adult patients with CRS and underlying primary or secondary immunodeficiency. RESULTS Of the 2459 articles screened, 13 studies met the inclusion criteria: 2 prospective double-blind placebo-controlled trials, 2 prospective case-control studies, 2 prospective cohort studies, and 7 case series. The high degree of study heterogeneity precluded a meta-analysis. Antibiotic monotherapy was not linked with significant improvement in clinical, radiographic, or endoscopic outcomes. Immunoglobulin replacement therapy may potentially reduce the frequency of acute or chronic sinusitis in patients with primary immunodeficiency (PID) but may not improve their sinonasal symptoms. Outcomes from endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) were reported in 8 studies, which found that surgery was linked with improvement in symptoms, disease-specific quality of life, endoscopy scores, and radiographic scores. The average reported ESS revision rate was 14%. CONCLUSION Patients with CRS and immunodeficiency likely benefit from ESS based on the available evidence. Data supporting medical therapy in this targeted population is limited overall, but there may be a potential role for immunoglobulin therapy in patients with PID and CRS.","Samargandy, Shireen; Grose, Elysia; Chan, Yvonne; Monteiro, Eric; Lee, John M; Yip, Jonathan",International forum of allergy & rhinology,99,33

A list of such epitopes is provided. The number of these epitopes and the prevalence of the common coronaviruses suggest that a large part of the world population has some degree of specific immunity against SARS-CoV-2 already, even without having been infected by that virus.

However, there is lack of evidence of the clinical effects. The aim of the present study was to investigate the pain- and seroma-reducing effect of an abdominal binder in patients undergoing laparoscopic umbilical or epigastric hernia repair. METHODS Based on power analysis, a minimum of 54 patients undergoing laparoscopic umbilical and epigastric hernia repair were to be included. Patients were randomized to abdominal binders vs. no abdominal binders during the first postoperative week. Standardized surgical technique, anaesthesia, and analgesic regimens were used and study observers were blinded towards the intervention. Postoperative pain (visual analogue score) on day 1 was the primary outcome. In addition, ultrasonographic evaluation of seroma formation and several subjective patient-related parameters were registered. Furthermore, patients in the abdominal binder group were asked to rate benefits or discomforts of wearing the binder. RESULTS Data from 56 patients (abdominal binder, n = 28; no binder, n = 28) were available for analysis. No significant intergroup differences in postoperative pain or any of the other surgical outcomes, including seroma formation, were found. However, the abdominal binder group reported subjective beneficial effect of wearing the binder in 24 of the 28 patients (86%). No adverse effects of the abdominal binder were found. CONCLUSIONS There were no effects of an abdominal binder on pain, movement limitation, fatigue, seroma formation, general well-being, or quality of life. However, most patients claimed a subjective beneficial effect of using their abdominal binder.","Christoffersen, M W; Olsen, B H; Rosenberg, J; Bisgaard, T",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,99,24

RESULTS The number of plans created per 1,000 admissions in April 2020 was 333.0% higher than in 2019. A greater proportion of plans created during April 2020 were discussed with the patient and the proportion containing a 'for cardiopulmonary resuscitation' recommendation was higher across all population groups. A greater proportion of plans were created for younger adults and Black and minority ethnic groups during the pandemic. CONCLUSION Increased ACP during a crisis can be achieved alongside increased patient participation in decision making. A tool such as ReSPECT that supports recommendations for, as well as limitations on, treatment may have enabled the expansion of ACP observed.","Hurlow, Adam; Wyld, Lucy; Breen, Andrew",Clinical medicine,99,1

Viruses can spread in exosomes and thereby avoid immune recognition3. While biogenesis, binding and uptake of exosomes are well characterized4,5, delivery of exosome cargo into the cytoplasm is poorly understood3. We report that the phosphatidylserine receptor HAVCR1 (refs. 6,7) and the cholesterol transporter NPC1 (ref. 8) participate in cargo delivery from exosomes of hepatitis A virus (HAV)-infected cells (exo-HAV) by clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Using CRISPR-Cas9 knockout technology, we show that these two lipid receptors, which interact in the late endosome9, are necessary for the membrane fusion and delivery of RNA from exo-HAV into the cytoplasm. The HAVCR1-NPC1 pathway, which Ebola virus exploits to infect cells9, mediates HAV infection by exo-HAV, which indicates that viral infection via this exosome mimicry mechanism does not require an envelope glycoprotein. The capsid-free viral RNA in the exosome lumen, but not the endosomal uncoating of HAV particles contained in the exosomes, is mainly responsible for exo-HAV infectivity as assessed by methylene blue inactivation of non-encapsidated RNA. In contrast to exo-HAV, infectivity of HAV particles is pH-independent and requires HAVCR1 or another as yet unidentified receptor(s) but not NPC1. Our findings show that envelope-glycoprotein-independent fusion mechanisms are shared by exosomes and viruses, and call for a reassessment of the role of envelope glycoproteins in infection.","Costafreda, Maria Isabel; Abbasi, Abdolrahim; Lu, Hsinyi; Kaplan, Gerardo",Nature microbiology,99,12

Therefore, several guidelines from local authorities and international neurosurgical bodies have been published to help clinicians manage their patients. In addition, the academic health system (AHS), which is an integrated system containing a medical institution, universities, and a teaching hospital, may play some role in the management of patients during COVID-19. The objective of this study was to describe how each hospital in the authors' network adjusted their neurosurgical practice and how the AHS of the Universitas Gadjah Mada (UGM) played its role in the adaptation process during the pandemic. METHODS The authors gathered both local and national data about the number of COVID-19 infections from the government's database. To assess the contribution of the AHS to the efforts of each hospital to address the pandemic, questionnaires were given to 6 neurosurgeons, 1 resident, and 2 general surgeons about the management of neurosurgical cases during the pandemic in their hospitals. RESULTS The data illustrate various strategies to manage neurosurgical cases by hospitals within the authors' networks. The hospitals were grouped into three categories based on the transmission risk in each region. Most of these hospitals stated that UGM AHS had a positive impact on the changes in their strategies. In the early phase of the outbreak, some hospitals faced a lack of coordination between hospitals and related stakeholders, inadequate amount of personal protective equipment (PPE), and unclear regulations. As the nation enters a new phase, almost all hospitals had performed routine screening tests, had a sufficient amount of PPE for the medical personnel, and followed both national and international guidelines in caring for their neurosurgical patients. CONCLUSIONS The management of neurosurgical procedures during the outbreak has been a challenging task and a role of the AHS in improving patient care has been experienced by most hospitals in the authors' network. In the future, the authors expect to develop a better collaboration for the next possible pandemic.","Pramusinto, Handoyo; Tamba, Daniel Agriva; Subagio, Yoyok; Numberi, Tommy J; Pramujo, Bangun; Sinanu, Franklin L; Ariasthapuri, Gheanita; Bismantara, Haryo; Meliala, Andreasta",Neurosurgical focus,99,1

Annual rates and costs of spinal deformity surgery have both increased over the past two decades. However, the impact of non-elective status on total cost of hospitalization and patient outcomes has not been quantified. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the impact of admission status on patient outcomes and healthcare costs in spinal deformity surgery. METHODS All patients who underwent spinal deformity surgery at a single institution between 2008 and 2016 were grouped by admission status: elective, emergency (ED), or transferred. Demographics were compared by univariate analysis. Cost of care and length of stay (LOS) were compared between admission statuses using multivariable linear regression with elective admissions as reference. Multivariate logistic regression was utilized to assess in-hospital complications, discharge destination, and readmission rates. RESULTS There were 427 spinal deformity surgeries included in this study. Compared to elective patients, ED patients had higher Elixhauser Comorbidity Index scores (p < 0.0001), longer LOS (+ 10.9 days, 97.5% CI 6.1-15.6 days, p < 0.0001), and higher costs (+ $20,076, 97.5% CI $9,073-$31,080, p = 0.0008). Transferred patients had significantly higher Elixhauser scores (p = 0.0002), longer LOS (+ 8.8 days, 97.5% CI 3.0-14.7 days, p < 0.0001), and higher rates of non-home discharge (OR = 15.8, 97.5% CI 2.3-110.0, p = 0.001). CONCLUSION Patients admitted from the ED undergoing spinal deformity surgery had significantly higher cost of care and longer LOS compared to elective patients. Transferred patients had significantly longer LOS and a higher rate of non-home discharge compared to elective patients.","Shuman, William H; Chapman, Emily K; Gal, Jonathan S; Neifert, Sean N; Martini, Michael L; Schupper, Alexander J; Lamb, Colin D; McNeill, Ian T; Gilligan, Jeffrey; Caridi, John M",Spine deformity,99,19

The non-structural proteins of the viral replication complex are thought to be associated with these newly synthesized membranes. We studied this phenomenon, using a Huh7.5 cell clone displaying high levels of replication of a subgenomic replicon of the JFH-1 strain. Electron microscopy of ultrathin sections of these cells revealed the presence of numerous double membrane vesicles (DMVs), resembling those observed for other RNA viruses such as poliovirus and coronavirus. Some sections had more discrete multivesicular units consisting of circular concentric membranes organized into clusters surrounded by a wrapping membrane. These structures were highly specific to HCV as they were not detected in naive Huh7.5 cells. Preparations enriched in these structures were separated from other endoplasmic reticulum-derived membranes by cell cytoplasm homogenization and ultracentrifugation on a sucrose gradient. They were found to contain the non-structural NS3 and NS5A HCV proteins, HCV RNA and LC3-II, a specific marker of autophagic membranes. By analogy to other viral models, HCV may induce DMVs by activating the autophagy pathway. This could represent a strategy to conceal the viral RNA and help the virus to evade double-stranded RNA-triggered host antiviral responses. More detailed characterization of these virus-cell interactions may facilitate the development of new treatments active against HCV and other RNA viruses that are dependent on newly synthesized cellular membranes for replication.","Ferraris, Pauline; Blanchard, Emmanuelle; Roingeard, Philippe",The Journal of general virology,99,1

Social support has been identified as a significant factor in the successful adoption of lifestyle change for people with type 2 diabetes, however people with mental illness often have impoverished social networks leading to greater reliance upon professional care givers. This study maps the support provided by formal (paid and professional carers) and informal networks to people with mental illness and type 2 diabetes, comparing the experiences of people with a spouse with those without one. METHODS Interviews were conducted with 29 clients of a community nursing service with mental health problems who receive professional support to self-manage type 2 diabetes. Participants were asked to complete an egocentric social network map which involved mapping the people and services who support them to manage their health. Demographic data was collected as was data about co-morbidities and service use within the last 6 months. Network maps were supplemented by a series of open-ended questions about self-management practices, who supports these practices and what support they provide. RESULTS Participants identified small social networks with few friendship ties. These networks had diminished due to illness. For people with a spouse, this person provided significant support for chronic illness self-management performing a range of daily care and illness management tasks. People without a spouse were more reliant on professional and paid care givers for daily care and illness management. People without a spouse also demonstrated greater reliance upon weak social ties for emotional support and social connection and often developed friendships with formal caregivers. CONCLUSIONS Spousal support reduces the need for professional services. In the absence of a spouse, participants were more reliant upon paid and professional carers and weaker social ties for chronic illness support and social connection leading to greater vulnerability of loss of support.","Crotty, Mikaila M; Henderson, Julie; Ward, Paul R; Fuller, Jeffrey; Rogers, Anne; Kralik, Debbie; Gregory, Sue",BMC health services research,99,1

Critical care settings, which are areas of specialty nursing practice, are now routinely hiring NGNs in many hospitals. While evidence on NGN transition into critical care is emerging, best practices around training and support for these nurses are limited internationally, and non-existent within the Canadian context. Therefore, the aim of this systematic review is to identify, describe, and assess the effectiveness of interventions that support NGN transition into critical care clinical practice settings. METHODS This is a systematic review of interventions using the Joanna Briggs Institute Methodology. Data sources will include MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsychINFO, Education Source, and Nursing and Allied Health electronic databases. Two independent reviewers will screen titles and abstracts using predetermined inclusion criteria. A consensus meeting will be held with a third reviewer to resolve conflicts when necessary. Full texts will also be screened by two independent reviewers and with conflicts resolved by consensus. Data will be extracted using a standardized extraction form. We will assess the quality of all included studies using Joanna Briggs Institute quality assessment tools. Data describing interventions will be reported narratively and a meta-analysis will be conducted to determine effectiveness, if appropriate. DISCUSSION This systematic review will identify interventions that support NGN transition into critical care nursing practice. The findings of this study will provide a foundation for developing strategies to support NGN transition into these areas of specialty nursing practice.

Also noteworthy was the numerical domination of influenza B cases early in this influenza season, in contrast to their typically later peak in the past. Here, we dissect the 2019/2020 influenza season not only with regard to its unusually early activity, but also with regard to the relative dynamics of type A and type B cases. We propose that the recent expansion of a novel influenza B/Victoria clade may be associated with this shift in the composition and kinetics of the influenza season in the United States. We use epidemiological transmission models to explore whether changes in the effective reproduction number or short-term cross-immunity between these viruses can explain the dynamics of influenza A and B seasonality. We find support for an increase in the effective reproduction number of influenza B, rather than support for cross-type immunity-driven dynamics. Our findings have clear implications for optimal vaccination strategies.","Borchering, Rebecca K; Gunning, Christian E; Gokhale, Deven V; Weedop, K Bodie; Saeidpour, Arash; Brett, Tobias S; Rohani, Pejman",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,99,17

A thick pancreatic parenchyma is a major risk factor for PF. In this paper, we elucidate the feasibility of the new closure method using soft coagulation and polyglycolic acid felt with fibrin glue. METHODS In 2009-2013, 96 patients underwent DP with a novel closure method for pancreatic stump that utilized soft coagulation and polyglycolic acid felt with fibrin glue. We evaluated amylase levels in drainage fluid on postoperative days (POD) 1 and 3 and the incidence of postoperative PF according to International Study Group of Pancreatic Fistula (ISGPF) definitions. RESULTS Drain amylase levels on POD1 and POD3 were 275 and 241 U/L, respectively, and ISGPF-defined Grade B/C PF rates were 16.7%. No clinical factors were significantly associated with PF. Average pancreatic parenchymal thicknesses were similar in PF-positive and PF-negative patients (10.4 ± 2.6 mm vs. 10.1 ± 2.2 mm, P = 0.639). There was no significant difference in the postoperative PF rate between patients with thick (≥12 mm) and thin (<12 mm) pancreas (11.1 vs. 18.8%, P = 0.544). CONCLUSION Our novel pancreatic stump closure method appears to be simple and effective, particularly in patients with thick pancreas.","Akita, Hirofumi; Takahashi, Hidenori; Gotoh, Kunihito; Kobayashi, Shogo; Sugimura, Keijiro; Miyoshi, Norikatsu; Motoori, Masaaki; Noura, Shingo; Fujiwara, Yoshiyuki; Oue, Masayuki; Yano, Masahiko; Sakon, Masato; Ishikawa, Osamu",Langenbeck's archives of surgery,99,16

This can only be achieved by fostering a culture that rewards initiative and empowers inpatient teams to implement and comply with changes which everyone understands and benefits from. The experience of an inner London acute psychiatric unit has shown the value of combining proactive leadership, multidisciplinary decision making and good communication in adapting services to an everchanging environment. Practical solutions have emerged that have improved service delivery and patient care, and which will likely outlast the COVID-19 pandemic. These include changes to team work and routine, streamlining patient care with a focus on goal directed admissions, developing a healthier work environment and adopting novel technology in patient care and multidisciplinary collaboration.

Natural drugs are important alternative therapies in the treatment of and recovery from influenza and have been the subjects of intense investigation during the last few decades. Many reports have shown that the development of novel bioactive chemicals extracted from natural drugs has significant advantages. Oseltamivir is a successful case of an anti-influenza drug synthesized using two natural products, quinic acid, and shikimic acid, as starting materials. In China, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) plays an important role in the treatment of influenza. TCM herbal extracts and prescriptions or their isolated bioactive constituents have shown significant therapeutic and preventive effects against influenza. For example, the roots of Isatis indigotica (Banlangen) fight viral infection by targeting both the virus and the host and have significantly different effects than those of synthetic chemicals. Lianhuaqingwen capsule exerts its anti-influenza activity by regulating the immune response to interfere with both viral and host reactions and might well be an alternative therapeutic option to treat influenza virus infection. This paper reviews the chemical ingredients, crude extracts, and TCM prescriptions with anti-influenza activity reported during the period of 2010-September 2019. We hope that this comprehensive review will not only fuel research on anti-influenza active natural products and TCM research but also provide a promising alternative candidate for further anti-influenza drug development.","Zhang, Zhi-Jun; Morris-Natschke, Susan L; Cheng, Yung-Yi; Lee, Kuo-Hsiung; Li, Rong-Tao",Medicinal research reviews,99,10

However, it is presently unclear which interventions have been trialled to manage stress in stroke survivors and whether they translate to clinically relevant outcomes. The aim of this scoping review will be to examine stress management interventions in stroke survivors in order to map the types of interventions trialled, commonly reported stress outcome measures and whether a reduction in stress contributes to reductions in relevant clinical outcomes. METHODS AND ANALYSIS The methodological framework described in Arksey and O'Malley will be applied to this review. A draft search strategy was developed in collaboration with an experienced senior health research librarian. A systematic search of Medline, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane library, PsycInfo and Clinicaltrials.gov as well as hand searching of reference lists and reviews will identify relevant studies for inclusion. To be eligible for inclusion, studies must report on the outcomes of an intervention targeting stress management and resilience in stroke survivors. Study selection and critical appraisal of selected studies will be carried out independently by two authors, with discrepancies resolved by consensus. Data will be charted using a standard extraction form. Results will be tabulated and narratively summarised to highlight findings relevant to our research questions and to inform recommendations for future research. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION This study does not require ethics approval. This scoping review will provide a synthesis of evidence for stress management interventions in stroke survivors. It will identify and clarify the gaps in stress research specific to stroke pathologies and highlight promising interventions for future research. Findings will be relevant to researchers and healthcare workers and will be disseminated via publications in peer-reviewed journals and presented at conferences.","Hinwood, Madeleine; Ilicic, Marina; Gyawali, Prajwal; Kluge, Murielle Gabriela; Coupland, Kirsten; Smith, Angela; Nilsson, Michael; Walker, Frederick Rohan",BMJ open,99,23

We report our experience of performing general anesthesia on a Japanese child with BSS. Case presentation A bilateral repair of the corners of the mouth under general anesthesia was planned for an 18-month-old male with macrostomia; the child was 75 cm in height and weighed 9.9 kg. As insertion of the peripheral intravenous catheter was difficult, it was inserted before the surgery by a pediatrician. The patient wore a mask and was ventilated manually after loss of consciousness with intravenous anesthesia. A mask for adults provided a superior fit and was effective in preventing air leakage from the corners of the mouth. After rocuronium was administered, the larynx was spread with a Macintosh laryngoscope. There was no laryngeal anatomical abnormality, and tracheal intubation was readily possible. The operation was completed without incident. Stiffening of both arms occurred for several seconds one hour after the operation ended, but the patient did not develop other complications. Conclusions Mask ventilation and the insertion of an intravenous catheter may be difficult in the general anesthesia of patients with BSS, and anesthetic management requires caution.","Hamaguchi, Eisuke; Tsutsumi, Yasuo M; Kume, Katsuyoshi; Sakai, Yoko; Kakuta, Nami; Uemura, Yuta; Kawahito, Shinji; Tanaka, Katsuya",JA clinical reports,99,1

We quantified plasma immunoglobulin (Ig) and lymphocyte phenotypes among 31 pediatric heart and kidney recipients for two years post-transplant and from 10 non-transplanted children. METHODS Plasma IgM, IgG, and IgA were quantified by immunoturbidimetric assays, IgG subclasses were quantified by bead-based multiplex immunoassay, and lymphocyte phenotypes were assessed by flow cytometry. RESULTS Median age at transplant for SOT recipients was similar to that of the control cohort (15 vs. 12.5 years, respectively; p=0.61). Mean plasma IgG and IgM levels for SOT recipients fell significantly below the control cohort means by 1 month post-transplant (p<0.001 for both) and remained lower than control levels at 12-18 months post-transplant. Heart recipients had lower frequencies of CD45RA+CD4+ naïve T lymphocytes relative to kidney recipients. CONCLUSIONS Hypogammaglobulinemia was prevalent and persistent among pediatric SOT recipients and may be secondary to immunosuppressive medications, as well as loss of thymus tissue and CD45RA+CD4+ T cells in heart recipients.

Outcome parameters were graft and patient survival and the surgical complications. METHODS The records of 423 liver transplantation in 396 adult recipients were reviewed. PB was performed in all cases also in patients with transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts and redo transplants without temporary portacaval shunt. No hemodynamic instability was observed during venous reconstruction. RESULTS Operation time, cold ischemia time and anhepatic phase were, respectively, 316, 606 and 82 min, respectively. The mean intraoperative transfusion of packed red blood cells was 3.2 (range 1-48). Surgical complications were observed in 25% of the orthotopic liver transplantation and 2% of these was related to caval anastomosis. No case of caval thrombosis was observed; a stenosis was noted in seven patients, always treated with an endovascular approach. A postoperative ascites was observed in seven cases. Retransplantation was required in 6.3% patients. Overall in-hospital mortality was 5.3%, but no patient died through technical problems or complications related to PB procedure. One-, 3- and 5-year grafts and patients were 94%, 83% and 75%, and 92%, 86% and 79%, respectively.

METHODS We screened 12,778 participants at high risk of type 2 diabetes using a fasting plasma glucose and glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c). People with screen-detected type 2 diabetes were randomised in a parallel, three-arm, controlled trial with up to 46 months of follow-up, with a control arm (CON), a group-based lifestyle intervention of 6 core and up to 15 maintenance sessions (INT), or the same intervention with additional support from volunteers with type 2 diabetes trained to co-deliver the lifestyle intervention (INT-DPM). The pre-specified primary end point was mean HbA1c compared between groups at 12 months. RESULTS We randomised 432 participants (CON 149; INT 142; INT-DPM 141) with a mean (SD) age of 63.5 (10.0) years, body mass index (BMI) of 32.4 (6.4) kg/m2, and HbA1c of 52.5 (10.2) mmol/mol. The primary outcome of mean HbA1c at 12 months (CON 48.5 (9.1) mmol/mol, INT 46.5 (8.1) mmol/mol, and INT-DPM 45.6 (6.0) mmol/mol) was significantly lower in the INT-DPM arm compared to CON (adjusted difference -2.57 mmol/mol; 95% CI -4.5, -0.6; p = 0.007) but not significantly different between the INT-DPM and INT arms (-0.55 mmol/mol; 95% CI -2.46, 1.35; p = 0.57), or INT vs CON arms (-2.14 mmol/mol; 95% CI -4.33, 0.05; p = 0.07). Subgroup analyses showed the intervention had greater effect in participants < 65 years old (difference in mean HbA1c compared to CON -4.76 mmol/mol; 95% CI -7.75, -1.78 mmol/mol) than in older participants (-0.46 mmol/mol; 95% CI -2.67, 1.75; interaction p = 0.02). This effect was most significant in the INT-DPM arm (-6.01 mmol/mol; 95% CI -9.56, -2.46 age < 65 years old and -0.22 mmol/mol; 95% CI -2.7, 2.25; aged > 65 years old; p = 0.007). The use of oral hypoglycaemic medication was associated with a significantly lower mean HbA1c but only within the INT-DPM arm compared to CON (-7.0 mmol/mol; 95% CI -11.5, -2.5; p = 0.003). CONCLUSION The NDPS lifestyle intervention significantly improved glycaemic control after 12 months in people with screen-detected type 2 diabetes when supported by trained peer mentors with type 2 diabetes, particularly those receiving oral hypoglycaemics and those under 65 years old.

METHODS The study recruited 20 surgeons classified into two groups: group NS consisted of ten residents without any laparoscopic experience, and group ES consisted of ten surgeons with experience in conventional laparoscopy (performed >90 laparoscopic cholecystectomies) but without any experience in LESS surgery. Both groups completed a mini-trainee course that included four repetitions of a standardized task of circle pattern cutting (CIRCLE). Time, path length, and economy of movement were measured and compared. RESULTS Group ES presented significantly better time scores than group NS in all four repetitions. Economy of movement did not differ significantly between the two groups, whereas path length was shorter for beginners at the forth effort. Moreover, group ES failed to improve path length and economy of movement scores, whereas group NS improved their performance significantly in these parameters. CONCLUSIONS It seems that previous laparoscopic experience in conventional laparoscopy may not necessarily be an advantage in all parameters of LESS surgery and the learning process can be longer than expected even for experienced surgeons.","Alevizos, Leonidas; Brinkman, Willem; Fingerhut, Abe; Jakimowicz, Jack; Leandros, Emmanuel",World journal of surgery,99,1

This study aimed to investigate the differences in target BP and DDD between metabolic surgery and conventional treatment in T2DM patients with hypertension. MATERIALS AND METHODS This was a prospective study of 535 diabetes patients who underwent metabolic surgery (n=112) and medical treatment (n=423). Changes in the target BP from baseline to every follow-up were analysed. RESULTS Metabolic surgery decreased both office systolic and diastolic BP (DBP) and also significantly reduced ambulatory systolic BP(SBP) (132±2 vs 119±1 mmHg, p<0.0001), but not DBP (78 ±1 vs 76±1mmHg, p=0.177).The proportion of patients who maintained their SBP at <120 mmHg after 2 years (50% vs 1.9%, p<0.0001). Moreover, the rate of achieving the target SBP of 130 and 140 mmHg was also significantly higher in the surgery group, and this started from the initial 6months after commencing treatment to the end of follow-up. The dosage (DDD: 1.44±0.65 vs 0.32±0.05, p<0.001) of antihypertensive medication was significantly decreased in after metabolic surgery. Further, metabolic surgery, but not medical treatment, markedly improved the risks of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. CONCLUSIONS Metabolic surgery can effectively achieve the BP target and reduce the usage of antihypertensive medications as well as improve multiple metabolic dysfunction in T2DM patients with hypertension. This study provides an alternative approach to antagonize the metabolic related hypertension. This article is protected by copyright.

The COVID-19 virus was known earlier as 2019-nCoV. As of 12 February 2020, WHO reported 45,171 cases and 1115 deaths related to COVID-19. COVID-19 is similar to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) virus in its pathogenicity, clinical spectrum, and epidemiology. Comparison of the genome sequences of COVID-19, SARS-CoV, and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) showed that COVID-19 has a better sequence identity with SARS-CoV compared to MERS CoV. However, the amino acid sequence of COVID-19 differs from other coronaviruses specifically in the regions of 1ab polyprotein and surface glycoprotein or S-protein. Although several animals have been speculated to be a reservoir for COVID-19, no animal reservoir has been already confirmed. COVID-19 causes COVID-19 disease that has similar symptoms as SARS-CoV. Studies suggest that the human receptor for COVID-19 may be angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor similar to that of SARS-CoV. The nucleocapsid (N) protein of COVID-19 has nearly 90% amino acid sequence identity with SARS-CoV. The N protein antibodies of SARS-CoV may cross react with COVID-19 but may not provide cross-immunity. In a similar fashion to SARS-CoV, the N protein of COVID-19 may play an important role in suppressing the RNA interference (RNAi) to overcome the host defense. This mini-review aims at investigating the most recent trend of COVID-19.","Kannan, S; Shaik Syed Ali, P; Sheeza, A; Hemalatha, K",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,99,19

But the incidence and risk factors of postoperative delirium (POD) are not completely clear. The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence and risk factors of POD after novel triple-branched stent graft implantation. METHODS An observational study of AAD patients who underwent novel triple-branched stent graft implantation between January 2017 and July 2019 were followed up after surgery. Patients' delirium was screened by the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale and the Confusion Assessment Method for the intensive care unit from the first day after the operation, lasted 5 days. The risk factors of POD were analyzed by the Cox proportional hazard models. RESULTS A total of 280 AAD patients were enrolled in this research, the incidence of POD was 37.86%. Adjusting for age, body mass index, and mechanical ventilation duration, multivariate Cox regression analysis model revealed that non-manual work (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR] = .554; 95% CI: 0.335-0.915; P = .021), Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE-II) scores > 20 (AHR = 3.359, 95% CI: 1.707-6.609, P < .001), hypoxemia (AHR = 1.846, 95% CI: 1.118-3.048, P = .017), and more than two types of analgesics and sedatives were independently associated with POD. CONCLUSIONS This study showed that risk factors independently associated with POD were APACHE-II score > 20, hypoxemia, and more types of analgesics and sedatives, and non-manual work was the protective factor.

The cleavage stimulation factor-50 (CstF-50) has a role in this response, providing a link between transcription-coupled RNA processing and DNA repair. In this study, we show that CstF-50 interacts with nuclear poly(A)-specific ribonuclease (PARN) using in vitro and in extracts of UV-exposed cells. The CstF-50/PARN complex formation has a role in the inhibition of 3' cleavage and activation of deadenylation upon DNA damage. Extending these results, we found that the tumour suppressor BARD1, which is involved in the UV-induced inhibition of 3' cleavage, strongly activates deadenylation by PARN in the presence of CstF-50, and that CstF-50/BARD1 can revert the cap-binding protein-80 (CBP80)-mediated inhibition of PARN activity. We also provide evidence that PARN along with the CstF/BARD1 complex participates in the regulation of endogenous transcripts under DNA-damaging conditions. We speculate that the interplay between polyadenylation, deadenylation and tumour-suppressor factors might prevent the expression of prematurely terminated messengers, contributing to control of gene expression under different cellular conditions.","Cevher, Murat A; Zhang, Xiaokan; Fernandez, Sully; Kim, Sergey; Baquero, Jorge; Nilsson, Per; Lee, Sean; Virtanen, Anders; Kleiman, Frida E",The EMBO journal,99,27

Allergy is accompanied by a systemic inflammatory response and some epidemiological studies have reported a positive association between a history of allergy/asthma and dementia. To investigate whether chronic airway allergy influences the inflammatory status in the brain, AD-like pathology, and behaviour in relation to AD, we induced chronic airway allergy in triple transgenic AD (3xTgAD) and wildtype (WT) mice by repeated exposure to ovalbumin (OVA) as allergen. Behavioural tests relevant for hippocampus-dependent behaviour were performed. We found that allergy significantly increased the brain levels of immunoglobulin (Ig) G, IgE. In 3xTgAD mice, allergy increased the levels of decay accelerating factor and decreased the phosphorylation of p38. In contrast, allergy increased the levels of interleukin (IL)-1β and complement component 1q (C1q) in WT mice. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid analysis confirmed eosinophilia in both genotypes, but the basal levels of eosinophils were lower in 3xTgAD mice. In summary, allergy induced predominantly anti-inflammatory effects in 3xTgAD mice, and pro-inflammatory effects in WT mice, thus being another potential factor to be considered when studying AD pathogenesis.","Sarlus, Heela; Codita, Alina; Wang, Xiuzhe; Cedazo-Minguez, Angel; Schultzberg, Marianne; Oprica, Mircea",Neuroscience,99,31

ABCA4-retinal dystrophies are clinically heterogeneous, presenting with mild to severe degeneration of the retina. The purpose of this study was to clinically and genetically characterize patients with ABCA4-retinal dystrophies in Norway and describe phenotype-genotype associations. METHODS ABCA4 variants were detected in 111 patients with inherited retinal disease undergoing diagnostic genetic testing over a period of 12 years. In patients where only a single ABCA4 variant was found, whole-gene ABCA4 sequencing was performed and intronic variants were investigated by mRNA analyses in fibroblasts. Medical journals were used to obtain a clinical description and ultrawidefield autofluorescence images were used to analyse retinal degeneration patterns. RESULTS The genetic diagnostic yield was 89%. The intronic splice variant c.5461-10T>C was the most prevalent disease-causing variant (27%). Whole-gene ABCA4 sequencing detected two novel intronic variants (c.6729+81G>T and c.6817-679C>A) that we showed affected mRNA splicing. Peripheral retinal degeneration was identified in 33% of patients and was associated with genotypes that included severe loss of function variants. By contrast, peripheral degeneration was not found in patients with a disease duration over 20 years and genotypes including p.(Asn1868lle), c.4253+43G>A or p.(Gly1961Glu) in trans with a loss of function variant. CONCLUSION This study demonstrates the clinical and genetic heterogeneity of ABCA4-retinal dystrophies in Norway.

Progressive sensory loss can predispose patients to foot ulcer and the neuropathy oftentimes causes pain. The pain can significantly affect the quality of life of patients. OBJECTIVES To describes the health-related quality of life of patients with type II diabetes mellitus suffering from painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy at two referral hospitals in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, 2017. METHODS An institution based cross sectional study with internal comparison was conducted among a sample of 220 type II diabetes mellitus patients in a 1:1 matched ratio of those with and without diabetes associated peripheral neuropathic pain. All were having regular follow up at two hospitals in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The Short Form (SF-36) health-related quality of life instrument was used to collect data on quality of life while basic socio-demographic and other disease specific features were collected using a structured questionnaire. Descriptive statistics was used to examine the mean scores of health related quality of life. Cronbach's alpha coefficient and Pearson's correlation coefficient were applied to estimate the internal consistency, and the level of agreement between the different domains of SF-36, respectively. To measure association between health related quality of life domains and explanatory variables, independent T-test and ANOVA were performed followed by multiple linear regression analyses. RESULTS The health related quality of life of type II diabetes mellitus patients with peripheral neuropathic pain was poorer than those without pain in all the eight domains and the two summary scores by SF-36 (p < 0.001). Higher mean score difference was observed in Mental Component Summary Score (MCS) (14.6) compared to Physical Component Score (PCS) (9.3). Among the eight domains, the largest mean difference was found with the physical one (39.1) followed by mental health (38.2) and physical functioning (30). Pain intensity had a statistically significant negative correlation with all domains as well as the two summary scores. Younger age, a higher level of education, being single, a higher monthly income, normal body mass index, HbA1c less than seven mmo/L, absence of other diabetic complications and taking only oral hypoglycemic agents were found to predict better health related quality of life. CONCLUSION The presence of diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain was found to negatively influence the health-related quality of life of type II diabetic patients; the greatest impact being on the 'role physical' and 'mental health' domains. Older age, presence of diabetes related complications, longer duration of illness negatively influenced the health-related quality of life.","Degu, Hiwot; Wondimagegnehu, Abigiya; Yifru, Yared Mamushet; Belachew, Ayele",PloS one,99,16

The desvenlafaxine/venlafaxine ratio, either after a single dose or at steady state, can be used to determine whether a patient is functionally (i.e., phenotypically) a CYP 2D6 extensive or poor metabolizer (EM or PM). In turn, CYP 2D6 EM and PM status is important in determining the efficacy of venlafaxine as an antidepressant. Based on a secondary analysis of four of the venlafaxine registration trials, venlafaxine was effective in patients who were CYP 2D6 EMs versus a parallel placebo-treated control group, whereas it was not effective in patients who were CYP 2D6 PMs. Thus, venlafaxine is a useful example of how drugs can be used to quantify differences in drug metabolizing capacity among patients and how such differences can in turn affect the efficacy of a drug (i.e., make a patient an outlier on the usual dose-response curve).","Preskorn, Sheldon H",Journal of psychiatric practice,99,5

RECENT FINDINGS In the past two decades, tumor necrosis factor antagonist therapy has given clinicians better treatment options. However, not all patients respond to induction therapy with these agents, and of those initially responding, up to 40% ultimately lose response due to suboptimal drug exposure (e.g., caused by immunogenicity), side effects, or other poorly characterized mechanisms. Recently, additional therapies, such as vedolizumab, an integrin blocker that prevents T cell trafficking to the gut, and ustekinumab, an antibody blocking the common p40 subunit of interleukin (IL)-12 and 23, were introduced to the market. In addition, other agents including novel anti-trafficking therapies (e.g., anti-β7 and sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulators), antibodies against p19 (unique to IL-23), and small molecules including Janus kinase inhibitors are under investigation in phase II and III trials. Furthermore, the management of IBD has evolved from targeting control of symptoms to suppression of mucosal inflammation. This shift in thinking has been accompanied by the early use of highly effective therapy in poor prognosis patients, accelerated treatment escalation and utilization of a treat to target paradigm approach, and adoption of therapeutic drug monitoring. The treatment landscape for IBD is rapidly evolving with the recent approval of novel biologics as well as several other agents in late phase of clinical development. Moreover, we have started to use agents more intelligently with a focus on risk stratification and early use of highly effective therapy in high-risk patients, treat to target using patient-reported outcomes (PROs), biomarkers, endoscopy, and therapeutic drug monitoring.","Duijvestein, Marjolijn; Battat, Robert; Vande Casteele, Niels; D'Haens, Geert R; Sandborn, William J; Khanna, Reena; Jairath, Vipul; Feagan, Brian G",Current treatment options in gastroenterology,99,31

METHODS To collect information of public sentiment towards governments' reactions to COVID-19, we consider five factors for analysis: the number of confirmed cases per million population, the number of deaths per million population, governments' containment and health policies, their stringency policies, and their economic support policies. We examine the Kendall correlation of variables in the 14 countries and use the wild bootstrap method for regression models to find important regressors. RESULTS Our results show that people pay stronger attention on the results of governments' battle against COVID-19 (number of confirmed cases and deaths per million population) rather than what policies they initiate. Health policy and economic support do influence the approval of any national response to COVID-19. We also find that public satisfaction in Japan and South Korea toward the two governments' responses to the pandemic varies greatly versus that of other countries' citizens to their governments' responses.

Estimates of the impact of these interventions on SARS-CoV-2 transmission are critical for decision making in this and future outbreaks. We here aim to assess the impact of these NPIs on disease transmission by estimating changes in the basic reproduction number (R0) at national and cantonal levels in relation to the timing of these NPIs. We estimated the time-varying R0 nationally and in eleven cantons by fitting a stochastic transmission model explicitly simulating within-hospital dynamics. We used individual-level data from more than 1000 hospitalised patients in Switzerland and public daily reports of hospitalisations and deaths. We estimated the national R0 to be 2.8 (95% confidence interval 2.1–3.8) at the beginning of the epidemic. Starting from around 7 March, we found a strong reduction in time-varying R0 with a 86% median decrease (95% quantile range [QR] 79–90%) to a value of 0.40 (95% QR 0.3–0.58) in the period of 29 March to 5 April. At the cantonal level, R0 decreased over the course of the epidemic between 53% and 92%. Reductions in time-varying R0 were synchronous with changes in mobility patterns as estimated through smartphone activity, which started before the official implementation of NPIs. We inferred that most of the reduction of transmission is attributable to behavioural changes as opposed to natural immunity, the latter accounting for only about 4% of the total reduction in effective transmission. As Switzerland considers relaxing some of the restrictions of social mixing, current estimates of time-varying R0 well below one are promising. However, as of 24 April 2020, at least 96% (95% QR 95.7–96.4%) of the Swiss population remains susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. These results warrant a cautious relaxation of social distance practices and close monitoring of changes in both the basic and effective reproduction numbers.","Lemaitre, Joseph C; Perez-Saez, Javier; Azman, Andrew S; Rinaldo, Andrea; Fellay, Jacques",Swiss medical weekly,99,26

METHODS Patients with TASC C/D de novo femoropopliteal lesions were treated by implanting paclitaxel eluting stents. Patients were included in a single center registry and prospectively followed by clinical and ultrasound evaluation. X-ray of the stented zone was systematically performed 12 months after implantation. The primary endpoint was primary sustained clinical improvement after 12 months. RESULTS A total of 45 patients (48 limbs) suffering from claudication (25 limbs) or CLI (23 limbs) were enrolled. Lesions were either TASC C (28 limbs) or TASC D (20 limbs). The mean length of the treated segment was 252 ± 90 mm. The mean number of stents was 2.9 ± 1 (2-5). Mean follow up was 12.7 months. No patient was lost to follow up. At 1 year post procedure, primary and secondary sustained clinical improvements were 56.3 ± 7.4% and 80.1 ± 5.9% respectively. Freedom from target lesion and target extremity revascularization were 63.6% and 90.1%, respectively. Primary and secondary patency rates were 52.5% and 79.6%. One year primary sustained clinical improvement rates for TASC C/D were 63.3 ± 9.2% and 45.6 ± 11.7%, respectively (p = .34).

Active video games could be a way to maintain physical therapy at home as part of the rehabilitation. The aim of this review is to summarise the current best evidence for the effectiveness of home-based active video games on gait and balance, user compliance, feasibility and safety for pwMS. METHODS We searched for studies in five databases (PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane, CINAHL and Science direct) up to October 2020. Selection of studies, extraction of data and methodological quality assessment through the PEDro scale were made independently by two authors and discussed with a third author. RESULTS Nine studies were included in this systematic review. We found significant improvements in balance; results were mixed concerning mobility, physical activity and gait. Home-based active video games are feasible and safe, with good compliance and adherence. The methodological quality of the studies was moderate (PEDro scale: 5.3 ± 2). CONCLUSION Overall, home-based active video games were found safe and effective improving static and dynamic balance in pwMS. Compliance was good, probably because it is a motivating and enjoyable training. Active video games can be a relevant alternative for physical rehabilitation at home in pwMS. Future studies should follow more rigorous methodological standards (larger sample sizes, more randomised controlled trials) to improve the quality of evidence and include cost-effectiveness in the analysis.","Dalmazane, Marion; Gallou-Guyot, Matthieu; Compagnat, Maxence; Magy, Laurent; Montcuquet, Alexis; Billot, Maxime; Daviet, Jean-Christophe; Perrochon, Anaick",Multiple sclerosis and related disorders,99,1

METHODS This descriptive cross-sectional survey was performed on healthcare providers selected through the convenience sampling method from April 6 to May 19, 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic. To this end, a self-report web-based questionnaire made up of a sociodemographic characteristics information form, Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS), and Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS) was distributed. Descriptive statistics, chi-square test (χ2 ), and univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were accordingly practiced to analyze the data using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) software. RESULTS Of 1343 healthcare providers, 45.8% and 73.0% had moderate physical and psychological anxiety symptoms, respectively. The logistic regression model similarly demonstrated that anxiety caused by COVID-19 was significantly correlated with the age ranges of 41-50 (P = .007) and 51-60 (P = .014) years as well as male participants (P < .001). In addition, the prevalence rates of depression and stress were, respectively, reported by 35.1% and 27.8%. There was correspondingly a significant relationship between depression and age as well as stress and gender. CONCLUSIONS It seems that healthcare managers need to focus more attention on psychological aspects in healthcare providers during this pandemic and plan to teach them about coping strategies.","Kamali, Mahsa; Moosazadeh, Mahmood; Azizi, Marzieh; Ghasemian, Roya; Hasannezad Reskati, Maryam; Elyasi, Forouzan",Neuropsychopharmacology reports,99,16

The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has challenged traditional medical student recruitment and outreach. Instagram is a platform that can be used by residency programs to increase engagement and as a potential recruitment tool. The authors present social media failed and successful strategies used to increase engagement and gain new followers. Methods In June 2020, an initiative began to use Instagram on a more frequent and intentional basis. Three different strategies were implemented during the pandemic: mirroring Twitter posts, increasing multimedia, and leveraging Instagram Stories. The outcomes of interest included number of followers and engagement on posts. Data were collected October 2020. Results After June 1, 2020, the @mayoanesthesia account gained 1000 followers through 127 days, an average of 4.26 new followers each day. Before June 1, there were 24 total posts over 3.3 years with a total of 458 followers. Three different strategies were implemented at different times during the pandemic. During the mirroring Twitter posts period, the mean number of interactions per post was 14.5. During the second phase after separating the Twitter and Instagram strategy, the mean number of interactions per post increased to 57.8. Conclusion Residency programs can creatively, yet methodically, use Instagram posts to increase social media engagement during resident recruitment season during the COVID-19 pandemic and likely beyond.","Plack, Daniel L; Sharpe, Emily E; Wanderman, Robalee L; Ripoll, Juan G; Abcejo, Arnoley S",The journal of education in perioperative medicine : JEPM,99,1

The present study explores the preoperative risk factors for complications from LADG. PATIENTS AND METHODS This study involves 1257 patients who underwent standardized LADG in a single institution between January 2006 and June 2011. The risk factors for postoperative complications of LADG were evaluated by univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS In univariate analysis of overall postoperative complications, there were significant effects of age (above 65 years), obesity (a body mass index above 25 kg/m(2)), comorbidity, cerebrovascular disease, heart disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and combined comorbidities (three or more). Multivariate analysis of these risk factors showed that old age (P=.006), obesity (P<.001), and heart disease (P=.014) were independent risk factors for postoperative complications. Univariate analysis showed that obesity also had a significant effect on severe postoperative complications. CONCLUSIONS Older age, obesity, and heart disease are risk factors for postoperative complications after LADG. Greater caution or more limited surgery is required to reduce the high rate of complications in patients with these risk factors.","Kim, Hee Sung; Kim, Min Gyu; Kim, Beom Su; Lee, In Seob; Lee, Sol; Yook, Jeoung Hwan; Kim, Byung Sik",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

MATERIALS AND METHODS This Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) compliant, IRB-approved, multicenter, prospective, single arm study included 40 patients with 60 lung metastases treated during 48 cryoablation sessions, with currently a minimum of 12 months of follow-up. Patients were enrolled according to the following key inclusion criteria: 1 to 5 metastases from extrapulmonary cancers, with a maximal diameter of 3.5 cm. Local tumor control, disease-specific and overall survival rates were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Complications and changes in physical function and quality of life were also evaluated using Karnofsky performance scale, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status classification, and Short Form-12 health survey. RESULTS Patients were 62.6 ± 13.3 years old (26-83). The most common primary cancers were colon (40%), kidney (23%), and sarcomas (8%). Mean size of metastases was 1.4 ± 0.7 cm (0.3-3.4), and metastases were bilateral in 20% of patients. Cryoablation was performed under general anesthesia (67%) or conscious sedation (33%). Local tumor control rates were 56 of 58 (96.6%) and 49 of 52 (94.2%) at 6 and 12 months, respectively. Patient's quality of life was unchanged over the follow-up period. One-year overall survival rate was 97.5%. The rate of pneumothorax requiring chest tube insertion was 18.8%. There were three Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grade 3 procedural complications during the immediate follow-up period (pneumothorax requiring pleurodesis, noncardiac chest pain, and thrombosis of an arteriovenous fistula), with no grade 4 or 5 complications. CONCLUSION Cryoablation is a safe and effective treatment for pulmonary metastases with preserved quality of life following intervention.","de Baere, Thierry; Tselikas, Lambros; Woodrum, David; Abtin, Fereidoun; Littrup, Peter; Deschamps, Frederic; Suh, Robert; Aoun, Hussein D; Callstrom, Matthew",Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer,99,1

Despite the promise of IS, critical gaps and opportunities remain within the field to explicitly facilitate health equity, particularly as they relate to the role of social determinants of health and structural racism. In this commentary, we propose recommendations for the field of IS to include structural racism as a more explicit focus of our work. First, we make the case for including structural racism as a construct and promote its measurement as a determinant within existing IS frameworks/models, laying the foundation for an empirical evidence base on mechanisms through which such factors influence inequitable adoption, implementation, and sustainability of EBIs. Second, we suggest considerations for both EBIs and implementation strategies that directly or indirectly address structural racism and impact health equity. Finally, we call for use of methods and approaches within IS that may be more appropriate for addressing structural racism at multiple ecological levels and clinical and community settings in which we conduct IS, including community-based participatory research and stakeholder engagement. We see these as opportunities to advance the focus on health equity within IS and conclude with a charge to the field to consider making structural racism and the dismantling of racism an explicit part of the IS research agenda.","Shelton, Rachel C; Adsul, Prajakta; Oh, April",Ethnicity & disease,99,28

The present study aimed to measure the length of the extensor mechanism and to assess the effect of limb position on the quadriceps muscle length (QML)/femoral bone length (FL) ratio. STUDY DESIGN Three-dimensional computed tomography images were taken of 12 Beagle dogs. Each dog underwent computed tomographic imaging 24 times with different limb positions. The QML/FL was measured on each image, along with the hip flexion-extension, hip abduction-adduction and stifle flexion-extension angles. Multiple regression analysis was used to determine the effect of these angles on the QML/FL. RESULTS The QML/FL was increased with the hip extended (standardized partial regression coefficient 0.855 with linear plotting, 0.829 with log plotting) and with the stifle flexed (standardized partial regression coefficient 0.814 with linear plotting, 0.800 with log plotting). The partial regression coefficient of the hip abduction-adduction angle was small, indicating a small impact on the QML/FL. The 95% confidence range of the QML/FL with the hip extended and stifle flexed was 0.87 to 1.00 (mean ± standard deviation: 0.93 ± 0.03). CONCLUSION The QML/FL was more influenced by joint angles when the hip was flexed or the stifle was extended. Hence, these positions should be avoided when evaluating the QML/FL so that the QML is less altered by slight positioning disparities.","Murakami, Sawako; Nagahiro, Yukari; Shimada, Masakazu; Kanno, Nobuo; Suzuki, Shuji; Yogo, Takuya; Harada, Yasuji; Hara, Yasushi",Veterinary and comparative orthopaedics and traumatology : V.C.O.T,99,2

A recently introduced ""Pulse CO-Oximeter"" (Masimo Rainbow SET(R) Radical-7 Pulse CO-Oximeter, Masimo Corp., Irvine, CA) is intended to additionally monitor noninvasively the fractional carboxyhemoglobin and methemoglobin content in blood. The purpose of our study was to determine whether hypoxia affects the new device's estimated methemoglobin reading accuracy, and whether the presence of methemoglobin impairs the ability of the Radical-7 and a conventional pulse oximeter (Nonin 9700, Nonin Medical Inc., Plymouth, MN) to detect decreases in Sao2. METHODS Eight and 6 healthy adults were included in 2 study groups, respectively, each fitted with multiple sensors and a radial arterial catheter for blood sampling. In the first group, IV administration of approximately 300 mg sodium nitrite increased subjects' methemoglobin level to a 7% to 8% target and hypoxia was induced to different levels of Sao2 (70%-100%) by varying fractional inspired oxygen. In the second group, 15% methemoglobin at room air and 80% Sao2 were targeted. Pulse CO-oximeter readings were compared with arterial blood values measured using a Radiometer multiwavelength hemoximeter. Pulse CO-oximeter methemoglobin reading performance was analyzed by observing the incidence of meaningful reading errors at the various hypoxia levels. This was used to determine the impact on predictive values for detecting methemoglobinemia. Spo2 reading bias, precision, and root mean square error were evaluated during conditions of elevated methemoglobin. RESULTS Observations spanned 66.2% to 99% Sao2 and 0.6% to 14.4% methemoglobin over the 2 groups (170 blood draws). Masimo methemoglobin reading bias and precision over the full Sao2 span was 7.7% +/- 13.0%. Best accuracy was found in the 95% to 100% Sao2 range (1.9% +/- 2.5%), progressing to its worst in the 70% to 80% range (24.8% +/- 15.6%). Occurrence of methemoglobin readings in error >5% increased over each 5-point decrease in Sao2 (P < 0.05). Masimo Spo2 readings were biased -6.3% +/- 3.0% in the 95% to 100% Sao2 range with 4% to 8.3% methemoglobin. Both the Radical-7 and Nonin 9700 pulse oximeters accurately detected decreases in Sao(2) <90% with 4% to 15% methemoglobin, despite displaying low Spo2 readings when Sao2 was >95%. CONCLUSIONS The Radical-7's methemoglobin readings become progressively more inaccurate as Sao2 decreases <95%, at times overestimating true values by 10% to 40%. Elevated methemoglobin causes the Spo2 readings to underestimate Sao2 similar to conventional 2-wavelength pulse oximeters at high saturation. Spo2 readings from both types of instruments continue to trend downward during the development of hypoxemia (Sao2 <90%) with methemoglobin levels up to 15%.","Feiner, John R; Bickler, Philip E; Mannheimer, Paul D",Anesthesia and analgesia,99,17

In response, this study examined innovative approaches in the design of in-patient palliative care facilities. METHODS An ethnographic study comprised the identification and analysis of 30 architectural precedents, 24 qualitative, semistructured interviews with key stakeholders and 11 site visits, during which field notes and photographs were taken. Data were analysed using the framework approach, to identify design solutions that move beyond standard practice, to offer insight into the possibilities and challenges of processes of design or refurbishment in palliative care settings. RESULTS Three thematic areas of focus were derived from the analysis: (1) planning solutions that support privacy plus connection; (2) enhancing comfort through the use of non-standard materials-and managing the risks associated with those and (3) shaking off tradition in hospital design. CONCLUSIONS Myriad constraints resist innovation within the contemporary construction of hospital and hospice facilities. Drawing on a series of real-world examples, our findings point to the value of broad consultation and collaboration throughout the design process in achieving design solutions that go beyond standard practice for the benefit for patients, families and staff.","McLaughlan, Rebecca; Kirby, Emma",BMJ supportive & palliative care,99,31

BACKGROUND Documentation is an important part of nurses' work, and in the psychiatric outpatient care setting it can be time-consuming. Only very few research reports are available on nursing documentation in this care setting. METHODS A qualitative analysis of secondary data consisting of nursing documentation for 79 patients in four outpatient units (years 2016 - 2017). The data consisted of 1150 free text entries describing a contact or an attempted contact with 79 patients, their family members or supporting networks and 17 nursing care summaries. Deductive and inductive content analysis was used. SRQR-guideline was used for reporting. RESULTS We identified 71 different nursing interventions, 64 of which are described in the Nursing Interventions Classification. Surveillance and Care-Coordination were the most common interventions. The analysis revealed two perspectives which challenge the use of the classification: the problem of overlapping interventions and the difficulty of naming group-based interventions. CONCLUSION There is an urgent need to improve patient documentation in the adult psychiatric outpatient care setting, and standardized nursing terminologies such as the Nursing Interventions Classification could be a solution to this. However, the problems of overlapping interventions and naming group-based interventions, suggests that the classification needs to be further developed before it can fully support the systematic documentation of nursing interventions in the psychiatric outpatient care setting. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE This study describes possibilities of using a systematic nursing language to describe the interventions nurses use in the adult psychiatric outpatient setting. It also describes problems in the current free text based documentation.","Ameel, Maria; Leino, Hanna; Kontio, Raija; van Achterberg, Theo; Junttila, Kristiina",Journal of clinical nursing,99,1

We investigated the levels of D-dimer and C-reactive protein (CRP) in a cohort of HIV-infected adults with and without osteonecrosis of the femoral head. METHODS Forty-three HIV-infected patients with osteonecrosis of the femoral head and a comparison group of 50 HIV-infected patients with negative MRI of the hips and for whom serial plasma samples were available were included. D-dimer and CRP levels were measured prior to and at the time of diagnosis for osteonecrosis patients, at the time of negative MRI of the hips for controls, and at least 6 months later for both groups. RESULTS Biomarker levels were elevated at the time of diagnosis in the osteonecrosis cohort compared with controls. Median D-dimer value was 0.32 μg/ml in the osteonecrosis group compared with less than 0.22 μg/ml in the control group (P = 0.016). For CRP, the corresponding values were 2.52 mg/l and 1.23 mg/l (P = 0.003). Postdiagnosis, D-dimer and CRP levels were also elevated in the osteonecrosis patients compared with controls. Linear regression demonstrated a rise in D-dimer levels from prediagnosis to diagnosis in the osteonecrosis patients whereas CRP levels did not change significantly over time. CONCLUSION Compared to controls, patients who developed osteonecrosis had elevated levels of D-dimer and CRP at diagnosis. D-dimer levels increased whereas CRP levels did not change significantly from prediagnosis to diagnosis. These data suggest that patients with higher levels of inflammation are at an increased risk of osteonecrosis.","Morse, Caryn G; Dodd, Lori E; Nghiem, Khanh; Costello, Rene; Csako, Gyorgy; Lane, H Clifford; Lozier, Jay N; Kovacs, Joseph A",AIDS,99,7

Accident and Emergency (A&E) departments often tend to investigate abdominal pain through plain radiographs, which are occasionally reported by radiologists, thereby leaving behind few uncommon conditions, such as porcelain gallbladder unreported. Objectives We present three cases of porcelain GB in which initial diagnosis was not considered due to the presence of various other calcifications in the upper abdomen. Methods In A&E, plain abdominal X-rays were routinely performed in all three patients to investigate nonspecific postprandial abdominal pain. Although GB calcification was easy to diagnose on plain films, it was initially overlooked to be a cause of the symptoms and later was diagnosed on abdominal CT scans, performed for further evaluation. Results Abdominal X-rays revealed thin curvilinear calcification in the GB wall, partially calcified neck and body, and gall stones. CT scan confirmed porcelain GB in all three patients. Conclusion Gallbladder mural calcification is a rare cause of nonspecific abdominal pain, which is often overlooked on plain abdominal X-rays causing missed diagnosis. The association of porcelain GB with adenocarcinoma entails special emphasis on timely diagnosis and prompt management.","Iqbal, Sohail; Ahmad, Sarfraz; Saeed, Usman; Al-Dabbagh, Mohammed",Surgery journal,99,30

It is unclear if this discrepancy is due to differences in associated diagnoses. This study aimed to analyze the incidence of pediatric tracheostomy in the United States from 2003 to 2016 and to determine the odds of placement among Black children when compared with other children. STUDY DESIGN Retrospective. SETTING Academic hospital. SUBJECTS AND METHODS We used the 2003 to 2016 Kid Inpatient Database to determine the incidence of pediatric tracheostomy in the United States and determine the odds of tracheostomy placement in Black children when compared with other children. RESULTS A total of 26,034 pediatric tracheostomies were performed between 2003 and 2016, among which, 21% were Black children. The median age was 7 years (interquartile range [IQR] = 0 to 17); 43% were ≤2 years old, and 62% were male. The most common principal diagnosis was respiratory failure (72%). When compared with other children, Black children were more likely to undergo tracheostomy (odds ratio [OR] = 1.2; 95% CI, 1.1-1.3), which increased among children younger than 2 years old (OR = 1.5; 95% CI, 1.4-1.5). Black children with tracheostomies were also more likely to be diagnosed with laryngeal stenosis and bronchopulmonary dysplasia and to have an extended length of stay (P < .001). CONCLUSION Black children are 1.2 times more likely to undergo tracheostomy in the United States compared with other children. Further investigation is warranted to evaluate if there are underlying anatomical, environmental, or psychosocial factors that contribute to this discrepancy.","Brown, Clarice; Shah, Gopi B; Mitchell, Ron B; Lenes-Voit, Felicity; Johnson, Romaine F",Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,99,1

The influence of donors on the content and implementation of these programmes is thus inevitable. China is a large developing country that has received considerable international support for its HIV/AIDS programme. In the early stage of the response, each large HIV/AIDS project independently implemented their activities according to their project framework. When internationally funded projects were few and the quantity of domestic support was minimal, their independent implementation did not pose a problem. When many HIV/AIDS projects were simultaneously implemented in the same locations, problems emerged such as inconsistency and overlap in data collection. China has thus coordinated and integrated all large international and domestic HIV/AIDS projects into one national programme. The process of integration began slowly and initially consisted of unified data collection. Integration is now complete and encompasses the processes of project planning, budgeting, implementation, monitoring and evaluation. The process was facilitated by having a single coordinating body, cooperation from international agencies and financial commitment from the government. Some problems were encountered during this process, such as initial reluctance from health-care staff to allocate additional time to coordinate projects. This paper describes that process of integrating domestic and foreign HIV/AIDS projects and may serve as a useful example for other developing countries for management of scarce resources.","Wu, Zunyou; Wang, Yu; Mao, Yurong; Sullivan, Sheena G; Juniper, Naomi; Bulterys, Marc",Bulletin of the World Health Organization,99,27

This paper investigates disparities in county-level mortality rates across counties with higher and lower than national average Black population shares using nonlinear regression decomposition and estimates potential differential impact of social distancing measures. I find counties with Black population shares above the national share have mortality rates 2 to 3 times higher than in other counties. Observable differences in living conditions, health, and work characteristics reduce the disparity to approximately 1.25 to 1.65 overall, and explain 100% of the disparity at 21 days after the first case. Though higher rates of comorbidities in counties with higher Black population shares are an important predictor, living situation factors like single parenthood and population density are just as important. Higher rates of co-residence with grandchildren explain 11% of the 21 day disparity but do not appear important by 42 days, suggesting families may have been better able to protect vulnerable family members later in the epidemic. To analyze differential effects of social distancing measures use two approaches. First, I exploit the timing of interventions relative to the first case among counties that began their epidemic at the same time. Second, I use event study analysis to analyze within-county changes in mortality. Findings for social distancing measures are not always consistent across approaches. Overall, I find no evidence that school closures were less effective in counties with larger Black population shares, and some estimates suggest closures may have disproportionately helped more diverse counties and counties with high rates of grandparent and grandchild co-residence. Conversely, stay at home orders are less clearly associated with mortality in any counties, reaching peak unemployment did not reduce mortality in any models, and some estimates indicate reaching peak unemployment before the first case was associated with higher mortality rates, especially in more diverse counties.","Hamman, Mary K",Economics and human biology,99,27

Despite significant effort, no evidence of infection of other mammals, mostly rodents, was found, suggesting that no other vertebrates harbored TCRV. For this reason, it was hypothesized that TCRV was naturally hosted by artibeus bats. This is in stark contrast to other arenaviruses with known hosts, all of which are rodents. To examine this hypothesis, we conducted experimental infections of Jamaican fruit bats (Artibeus jamaicensis) to determine whether they could be persistently infected without substantial pathology. We subcutaneously or intranasally infected bats with TCRV strain TRVL-11573, the only remaining strain of TCRV, and found that low-dose (10(4) 50% tissue culture infective dose [TCID(50)]) inoculations resulted in asymptomatic and apathogenic infection and virus clearance, while high-dose (10(6) TCID(50)) inoculations caused substantial morbidity and mortality as early as 10 days postinfection. Uninoculated cage mates failed to seroconvert, and viral RNA was not detected in their tissues, suggesting that transmission did not occur. Together, these data suggest that A. jamaicensis bats may not be a reservoir host for TCRV.","Cogswell-Hawkinson, Ann; Bowen, Richard; James, Stephanie; Gardiner, David; Calisher, Charles H; Adams, Rick; Schountz, Tony",Journal of virology,99,17

The evidence presented thus far, however, is often contradictory and based mostly on RNA-sequencing data for the quantification of immune cell phenotypes. Few studies have investigated TMB across acral, mucosal, and cutaneous melanoma subtypes, which are known to have different TMB. It is also unknown whether chromosomal structural mutations (SVs) contribute to the immunogenicity in acral and mucosal melanomas where such aberrations are common. We stained 151 cutaneous and 35 acral and mucosal melanoma patient samples using quantitative IHC and correlated immune infiltrate phenotypes with TMB and other genomic profiles. TMB and SVs did not correlate with the densities of CD8+ lymphocytes, CD103+ tumor-resident T cells (Trm), CD45RO+ cells, and other innate and adaptive immune cell subsets in cutaneous and acral/mucosal melanoma tumors, respectively, including in analyses restricted to the site of disease, and in a validation cohort. In 43 stage III treatment-naïve cutaneous melanoma patients, we found that the density of immune cells, particularly Trm, was significantly associated with patient survival but not with TMB. Overall, TMB and chromosomal structural aberrations are not associated with protective antitumor immunity in treatment-naïve melanoma.","Edwards, Jarem; Ferguson, Peter M; Lo, Serigne N; Pires da Silva, Ines; Colebatch, Andrew J; Lee, Hansol; Saw, Robyn Pm; Thompson, John F; Menzies, Alexander M; Long, Georgina V; Newell, Felicity; Pearson, John; Waddell, Nicola; Hayward, Nicholas; Johansson, Peter A; Mann, Graham; Scolyer, Richard A; Palendira, Umaimainthan; Wilmott, James S",Cancer immunology research,99,23

However, precise predictors of treatment outcomes are still lacking. This study aimed to use angiographic parametric imaging (API)-derived radiomics features to explore whether biomarkers extracted from immediate postprocedural digital subtraction angiography (DSA) were associated with complications and embolization outcomes of IAs treated with PED without adjunctive coils. METHODS Radiomic features were extracted from postprocedural DSA by API, and radiomics feature selection and radiomics score calculation were performed by the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression. Angiographic findings and clinical characteristics were screened using stepwise multivariable logistic regression analysis to identify significant variables for predicting the complication endpoint. Radiomics feature selection and radiomics risk score (RadRS) calculations were performed by LASSO Cox regression. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to identify significant predictors for the occlusion endpoint. RESULTS We screened 281 observations for complications and 235 observations for embolization outcomes from IAs treated in our center using PED between June 2015 and July 2020. Multivariate regression analysis showed association of the radiomics score (p<0.01) and hypertension (p=0.04) with complications. RadRS (p<0.01), symptoms (p<0.01), and age (p=0.03) were predictors of embolization outcomes. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that symptomatic patients (p<0.01) and those with off-label IAs (p=0.03) had shorter intervals to complete occlusion. CONCLUSIONS Biomarkers extracted from immediate postprocedural DSA by API could be potential indicators for assessing treatment outcomes of IAs treated by PED without adjunctive coils.","Liang, Fei; Ma, Chao; Zhu, Haoyu; Liu, Lian; Liang, Shikai; Jiang, Peng; Zhang, Yupeng; Jiang, Chuhan",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,99,6

Early attempts to control COVID-19 altered these assumptions with daycares/schools closing and the heavy shift to remote work. This calls into question whether couples tended to fall back on familiar gendered patterns to manage work and family, or if they adopted new strategies for the unique pandemic situation. We addressed this question using a sample of 274 dual-earner couples with young children. We content coded couples' qualitative responses about their plans for managing childcare and work commitments and used these codes in a latent class analysis to identify subgroups. Seven classes were identified, with 36.6% of the sample using strategies where women did most or all childcare, 18.9% of the sample using strategies that were not clearly gendered or egalitarian, and 44.5% of the sample using unique egalitarian strategies. We also obtained data from 133 of these couples approximately 7 weeks later regarding their well-being and job performance. Results suggested that women in the Remote Wife Does It All class had the lowest well-being and performance. There were nuanced differences between the egalitarian strategies in their relationships with outcomes, with the Alternating Days egalitarian category emerging as the overall strategy that best preserved wives' and husbands' well-being while allowing both to maintain adequate job performance.

This current review is one of the few kinds of research, which has sought to check the effect of the coronavirus on mental health issues and the need for psychological well-being in the standard population and patients in response to the global wake of the epidemic and its effects in Pakistan. SUBJECTS AND METHODS This study has utilized the data on coronavirus patients from the Ministry of Health, National Institute of Health Pakistan. The age of the confirmed coronavirus patients ranged from 12 to over 80 years, including international and local transmitters. RESULTS Recorded data delivered by the National Institute of Health, Pakistan has quantified that the outbreak of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) entered Pakistan through international travelers. They carried the virus after they visited different countries, such as Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, the USA, China, and European countries. By April 30, 2020, there were 16,473 confirmed cases of coronavirus. Total deaths are 361, with a mortality rate of 2.20%, and ultimately recovered cases reported 4,105 with a percentage of 24.90%. As of October 24, 2020, there were 327,063 confirmed cases of the COVID-19 in Pakistan, which posed vast social, economic, health, and environmental problems in the society. The epidemic has affected individuals across the country and confirmed patients in the country increased rapidly. CONCLUSION The government officials had initially estimated over 50,000 corona patents by April 30, which would be a great challenge; however, the situation remained under control because of suppression and smart-lockdown strategies by the Government. This study's findings reported that superior health facilities are required to treat the patients.

There is no consensus on the optimal value, below which there is a higher chance of wound complications in patients undergoing free flap breast reconstruction. METHODS Patients undergoing free flap breast reconstruction from 2015 to 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients who returned to the operating room for a revision of the anastomosis were excluded from analysis. Patients were divided in two groups based on the development of late complications. Those were defined as fat necrosis, wound dehiscence, or distal flap ischemia/necrosis that developed after discharge from the hospital. Mean percutaneous oximetry readings of the first 24 hours were recorded and the mean change from the initial reading was calculated. The correlation between tissue oximetry change and development of complications was explored. RESULTS A total of 120 patients were identified. The mean age was 53, while the mean body mass index was 33. A total of 38 patients developed late wound complication. History of smoking, diabetes mellitus, neoadjuvant radiation therapy, and the mean change of the tissue oximetry reading were identified as independent predictors of wound complications. The absolute number of the tissue oximetry reading did not predict late complications. A multivariate analysis revealed that patients who experienced a mean decrease < 15% from the initial reading during the first 24 hours were significantly more likely to develop late flap-related wound complications. CONCLUSION In patients undergoing free tissue breast reconstruction, tissue oximetry readings do not predict late wound complications. However, the mean change at 24 hours from the initial reading does. A decrease of <15% in tissue perfusion was associated with a significant increase in the probability of developing flap-related wound complications.","Saad, Noah; Wang, Howard; Karamanos, Efstathios",Journal of reconstructive microsurgery,99,26

MATERIALS AND METHODS Initially, all SOAIC was performed with intention to treat using a standard selective OA (microcatheter) infusion technique (sSOAIC). Temporary balloon occlusion (TBO) of the external carotid artery (ECA), a balloon-assisted SOAIC (bSOAIC) technique, was performed only if OA angiography did not show robust and sustained anterograde OA flow. In our more recent experience, all SOAIC was performed with intention to treat by bSOAIC. Verapamil infusion into the OA and internal carotid artery was performed in selected cases. Technical success was defined as delivery of chemotherapeutic agent(s) into the OA with robust and sustained anterograde perfusion. sSOAIC was considered to have failed if converted to bSOAIC. RESULTS 19 eyes were treated in 17 patients (age 5 months to 16 years) between December 2008 and May 2013. Eighty-three procedures were undertaken and the OA was successfully catheterized in all. Technical success was achieved in 35/41 (85%) sSOAIC cases and 42/42 (100%) bSOAIC cases. TBO of the ECA augmented anterograde OA flow and converted all cases of retrograde OA flow to anterograde. Verapamil further augmented anterograde ocular perfusion during SOAIC. There were no access site complications, strokes, or deaths. CONCLUSIONS TBO of the ECA is a safe, effective, and reproducible method for optimizing ocular hemodynamics during SOAIC regardless of baseline OA flow pattern. Verapamil infusion may further favorably modify OA flow.

If the mouth and nose of patients with infection are irrigated with antimicrobial solutions, this may help the patients by killing any coronavirus present at those sites. It may also reduce the risk of the active infection being passed to HCWs through droplet transmission or direct contact. However, the use of such antimicrobial solutions may be associated with harms related to the toxicity of the solutions themselves or alterations in the natural microbial flora of the mouth or nose. OBJECTIVES To assess the benefits and harms of antimicrobial mouthwashes and nasal sprays administered to patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection to both the patients and the HCWs caring for them. SEARCH METHODS Information Specialists from Cochrane ENT and Cochrane Oral Health searched the Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2020, Issue 6); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 1 June 2020. SELECTION CRITERIA: This is a question that urgently requires evidence, however at the present time we did not anticipate finding many completed RCTs. We therefore planned to include the following types of studies: randomised controlled trials (RCTs); quasi-RCTs; non-randomised controlled trials; prospective cohort studies; retrospective cohort studies; cross-sectional studies; controlled before-and-after studies. We set no minimum duration for the studies. We sought studies comparing antimicrobial mouthwash and/or nasal spray (alone or in combination) at any concentration, delivered with any frequency or dosage to suspected/confirmed COVID-19 patients. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. Our primary outcomes were: 1) RECOVERY* (www.recoverytrial.net) outcomes in patients (mortality; hospitalisation status; use of ventilation; use of renal dialysis or haemofiltration); 2) incidence of symptomatic or test-positive COVID-19 infection in HCWs; 3) significant adverse event: anosmia (or disturbance in sense of smell). Our secondary outcomes were: 4) change in COVID-19 viral load in patients; 5) COVID-19 viral content of aerosol (when present); 6) other adverse events: changes in microbiome in oral cavity, nasal cavity, oro- or nasopharynx; 7) other adverse events: allergy, irritation/burning of nasal, oral or oropharyngeal mucosa (e.g. erosions, ulcers, bleeding), long-term staining of mucous membranes or teeth, accidental ingestion. We planned to use GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. MAIN RESULTS We found no completed studies to include in this review. We identified 16 ongoing studies (including 14 RCTs), which aim to enrol nearly 1250 participants. The interventions included in these trials are ArtemiC (artemisinin, curcumin, frankincense and vitamin C), Citrox (a bioflavonoid), cetylpyridinium chloride, chlorhexidine, chlorine dioxide, essential oils, hydrogen peroxide, hypertonic saline, Kerecis spray (omega 3 viruxide - containing neem oil and St John's wort), neem extract, nitric oxide releasing solution, povidone iodine and saline with baby shampoo. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We identified no studies for inclusion in this review. This is not surprising given the relatively recent emergence of COVID-19 infection. It is promising that the question posed in this review is being addressed by a number of RCTs and other studies. We are concerned that few of the ongoing studies specifically state that they will evaluate adverse events such as changes in the sense of smell or to the oral and nasal microbiota, and any consequences thereof. Very few interventions have large and dramatic effect sizes. If a positive treatment effect is demonstrated when studies are available for inclusion in this review, it may not be large. In these circumstances in particular it may be a challenge to weigh up the benefits against the harms if the latter are of uncertain frequency and severity.","Burton, Martin J; Clarkson, Janet E; Goulao, Beatriz; Glenny, Anne-Marie; McBain, Andrew J; Schilder, Anne Gm; Webster, Katie E; Worthington, Helen V",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,99,33

This study provides insights into how dentists navigated the interactions between the commercial nature of dental practice and the provision of care to patients who either struggled to (or could not) afford the cost of self-funded care in private practice. METHODS Participants took part in semi-structured interviews and were invited to keep an online diary of reflections. Thematic analysis was used to examine the data to extract and synthesise understanding of how practitioners conceptualised issues surrounding providing care for the disadvantaged and how this related to the economic realities of private practice. RESULTS Twenty participants were recruited and interviewed from a variety of private practice environments and roles. This report focuses on one specific theme within the data that explored how participants viewed patients who received public dental care, as well as those privately funded patients who could ill-afford their treatment. CONCLUSIONS The findings raise how neoliberal attitudes towards oral healthcare and dental disease may act as a social determinant of health and contribute to the sustaining of structural barriers and inaction towards oral health injustice. For low-income patients, practitioners distinguish between (a) those who are deemed to be deserving of professional care and the charitable endeavours of the profession, and (b) those who are not. There appears to be no overt professional obligation to actively work towards the amelioration of oral health injustice.","Holden, A Cl; Adam, L; Thomson, M",Community dental health,99,1

Their management is evolving with the development of percutaneous ablation, particularly radiofrequency ablation, cryoablation, and microwave ablation. The typical indications that must be validated by a multidisciplinary committee include solid tumors less than 3cm in patients with multiple comorbidity factors (including age), contraindications to surgery, hereditary renal cancer, bilateral renal tumors, solitary kidney, pre-existing chronic kidney disease, or at high risk of predialysis renal function after partial nephrectomy. As tumor ablation offers almost similar oncologic outcome when compared with surgery, new indications are appearing such as larger tumors, benign, or cystic neoplasms. The biopsy of solid renal masses is recommended in most cases. Careful and systematic treatment planning is required to avoid complications, paying specific attention of the relationships to the bowel structures, and urinary tract. Specific maneuvers can be necessary such as gas or liquid dissection and pyeloperfusion. The technique of ablation depends on availability, training, and tumor size and location, with a preference to cryotherapy for central and large lesions. Evaluation of therapeutic efficacy relies on contrast-enhanced imaging (computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging or even ultrasound). The follow-up must be continued up to 10 years after ablation. The overall efficacy is more than 90% with a reduced complication rate less than 10%. Renal tumor percutaneous ablation is sparing the renal function and should be the preferred treatment in the case of pre-existing chronic kidney disease.","Correas, Jean-Michel; Delavaud, Christophe; Gregory, Jules; Le Guilchet, Thomas; Lamhaut, Lionel; Timsit, Marc-Olivier; Méjean, Arnaud; Hélénon, Olivier","Seminars in ultrasound, CT, and MR",99,23

This will require advancements that go beyond the basic components of general intelligence. The term ""intelligence"" does not best represent the technological needs of advancing society, because it is ""wisdom"", rather than intelligence, that is associated with greater well-being, happiness, health, and perhaps even longevity of the individual and the society. Thus, the future need in technology is for artificial wisdom (AW). METHODS We examine the constructs of human intelligence and human wisdom in terms of their basic components, neurobiology, and relationship to aging, based on published empirical literature. We review the development of AI as inspired and driven by the model of human intelligence, and consider possible governing principles for AW that would enable humans to develop computers which can operationally utilize wise principles and result in wise acts. We review relevant examples of current efforts to develop such wise technologies. RESULTS AW systems will be based on developmental models of the neurobiology of human wisdom. These AW systems need to be able to a) learn from experience and self-correct; b) exhibit compassionate, unbiased, and ethical behaviors; and c) discern human emotions and help the human users to regulate their emotions and make wise decisions. CONCLUSIONS A close collaboration among computer scientists, neuroscientists, mental health experts, and ethicists is necessary for developing AW technologies, which will emulate the qualities of wise humans and thus serve the greatest benefit to humanity. Just as human intelligence and AI have helped further the understanding and usefulness of each other, human wisdom and AW can aid in promoting each other's growth.","Jeste, Dilip V; Graham, Sarah A; Nguyen, Tanya T; Depp, Colin A; Lee, Ellen E; Kim, Ho-Cheol",International psychogeriatrics,99,1

We aimed to describe the electrophysiological characteristics of AMC-AP and the related anatomy. METHODS AND RESULTS This study involved eight (male/female = 3/5, mean age 42.6 ± 10.5 years) patients with left-sided AP successfully ablated in the AMC region. The retrograde atrial activation sequence was analysed and compared via recordings at the His-bundle (HB), coronary sinus (CS), and roving catheter during tachycardia, and the peak of QRS from the same cardiac circle used as time reference. Of the eight patients, two received prior ablations. During tachycardia, the activation time at the proximal CS (CSp), lateral CS (CSl), and HB region averaged 120 ± 26 ms, 124 ± 29 ms, and 117 ± 21 ms following the reference, respectively (P = 0.86). The latest atrial activation was recorded in the posterior CS which averaged 135 ± 25 ms following the reference. Placing the ablation catheter to AMC via retrograde approach was attempted in all cases but stable positioning achieved in none. Via transseptal approach, the ablation catheter could be easily placed at the AMC and recorded the earliest retrograde atrial activations with 60 ± 27 ms earlier than the relatively 'earliest' CS/HB recordings, and ablation at this site successfully eliminated AP conduction. No patients had recovered AP conduction after at least 12-month follow-up. CONCLUSION AMC-AP is featured by recording comparable retrograde atrial activation times at CSp, CSl, and HB with the latest recordings at the posterior CS. Stable placement and successful ablation in the AMC via retrograde aortic approach was difficult but can be achieved via transseptal approach.","Li, Meng-Meng; Long, De-Yong; Sang, Cai-Hua; Jiang, Chen-Xi; Guo, Xue-Yuan; Zhao, Xin; Li, Song-Nan; Wang, Wei; Tang, Ri-Bo; Li, Jing-Ye; Dai, Wen-Li; Kong, Xiang-Yi; Zuo, Song; Ning, Man; Li, Xu; Wu, Jia-Hui; Dong, Jian-Zeng; Du, Xin; Ma, Chang-Sheng","Europace : European pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac electrophysiology : journal of the working groups on cardiac pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac cellular electrophysiology of the European Society of Cardiology",99,1

Allotransplantation is the most promising approach for treatment particularly for its cost-effective and exact curative potential. Herein our aim was to evaluate human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A allele matching effect on clinical improvement and graft survival after parathyroid transplantation. We performed parathyroid transplantation between ABO/Rh compatible recipient and an unrelated donor who has chronic kidney disease. Preoperative immunological tests include panel reactive antibody, T-flow cytometry crossmatch, B-flow cytometry crossmatch, autoflow cytometry crossmatch, and complement-dependent cytotoxicity crossmatch tests were performed. After histopathological evaluation, half of the resected parathyroid gland cells were isolated and transplanted to the omentum surface by laparoscopy. The transplantation outcome was followed up throughout 382 days. The recipient discharged 2 days after transplantation without any complication. During follow-up, calcium and vitamin D supplementation reduced to a one-third dose; even the intact PTH levels remained low. However, clinical improvement was observed by serum calcium levels. The recipient still continues with low-dose supplementation after 382 days of post-transplantation. Parathyroid cell transplantation to the omental tissue is the most promising option even with only one allele matching for patients with using lifelong high-dose supplementation. Clinical improvements and long-term effect of HLA-A allele matching should be evaluated with more studies and in larger cohorts as well.","Goncu, Beyza; Salepcioglu Kaya, Harika; Yucesan, Emrah; Ersoy, Yeliz Emine; Akcakaya, Adem",Journal of investigative medicine : the official publication of the American Federation for Clinical Research,99,29

This study aimed to systematically review and meta-analyse the association between cognitive impairment and medication non-adherence in stroke. METHODS A systematic literature search of longitudinal and cross-sectional studies of adults with any stroke type, which reported on the association between any measure of non-adherence and cognitive impairment, was carried out according to PRISMA guidelines. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were the primary measure of effect. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Bias Methods Group's Tool to Assess Risk of Bias in Cohort Studies, with evidence quality assessed according to the GRADE approach. We conducted sensitivity analyses according to measure of cognitive impairment, measure of medication adherence, population, risk of bias and adjustment for covariates. The protocol was registered with PROSPERO. RESULTS From 1,760 titles and abstracts, we identified 9 studies for inclusion. Measures of cognitive impairment varied from dementia diagnosis to standardised cognitive assessments. Medication adherence was assessed through self-report or administrative databases. The majority of studies were of medium risk of bias (n = 6); two studies had low risk of bias. Findings were mixed; when all studies were pooled, there was no evidence of an association between cognitive impairment and medication non-adherence post-stroke [OR (95% CI): 0.85 (0.66, 1.03)]. However, heterogeneity was substantial [I2 = 90.9%, p < .001], and the overall evidence quality was low. CONCLUSIONS Few studies have explored associations between cognitive impairment and medication adherence post-stroke, with substantial heterogeneity in study populations, and definitions and assessments of non-adherence and cognitive impairment. Further research using clear, standardised and objective assessments is needed to clarify the association between cognitive impairment and medication non-adherence in stroke.","Rohde, Daniela; Merriman, Niamh A; Doyle, Frank; Bennett, Kathleen; Williams, David; Hickey, Anne",PloS one,99,1

This study aimed to use anonymised veterinary clinical data from the VetCompass™ Programme to report the frequency of common disorders of dogs under primary veterinary care in the UK during 2016 and to explore effects associated with age, sex and neuter status. RESULTS From an available population of 905,543 dogs under veterinary care at 886 veterinary clinics during 2016, the current study included a random sample of 22,333 (2.47 %) dogs from 784 clinics. Prevalence for each disorder was calculated at the most refined level of diagnostic certainty (precise-level precision) and after grouping to a more general level of diagnostic precision (grouped-level precision). The most prevalent precise-level precision disorders recorded were periodontal disease (prevalence 12.52 %, 95 % CI: 12.09-12.97), otitis externa (7.30 %, 95 % CI: 6.97-7.65) and obesity (7.07 %, 95 % CI: 6.74-7.42). The most prevalent grouped-level disorders were dental disorder (14.10 %, 95 % CI: 13.64-14.56), skin disorder (12.58 %, 95 % CI: 12.15-13.02) and enteropathy (10.43 %, 95 % CI: 10.04-10.84). Associations were identified for many common disorders with age, sex and neuter. CONCLUSIONS The overall findings can assist veterinarians and owners to prioritise preventive care and to understand demographic risk factors in order to facilitate earlier diagnosis of common disorders in dogs. The information on associations with age, sex and neuter status provides additional contextual background to the complexity of disorder occurrence and supports targeted health controls for demographic subsets of dogs.","O'Neill, Dan G; James, Hannah; Brodbelt, Dave C; Church, David B; Pegram, Camilla",BMC veterinary research,99,10

OBJECTIVES In this study, we investigated discourses on HIPAA in relation to COVID-19. METHODS Through a search of media sources in the Factiva database, relevant texts were identified. We applied a text mining approach to identify concepts and themes in these texts. RESULTS Our analysis revealed six central themes, namely, Health, HIPAA, Privacy, Security, Patients, and Need, as well as their associated concepts. Among these, Health was the most frequently discussed theme. It comprised concepts such as public, care, emergency, providers, telehealth, entity, use, discretion, OCR, Health and Human Services (HHS), enforcement, business, and services. CONCLUSION Our discourse analysis of media outlets highlights the role of health data privacy law in the response to global public health emergencies and demonstrates how discourse analysis and computational methods can inform health data protection policymaking in the digital health era.","Pool, Javad; Akhlaghpour, Saeed; Fatehi, Farhad",Studies in health technology and informatics,99,16

In most developing countries, the availability of huge amounts of agricultural waste has paved the way for studying how these materials can be processed into self-compacting concrete as binders and aggregate compositions. Therefore, this experimental program was carried out to study the properties of self-compacting concrete (SCC) made with local metakaolin and coal bottom ash separately and combined. Total 25 mixes were prepared with four mixes as 5, 10, 15, and 20% replacement of cement with metakaolin; four mixes as 10, 20, 30, and 40% of coal bottom ash as partial replacement of fine aggregates separately; and 16 mixes prepared combined with metakaolin and coal bottom ash. The fresh properties were explored by slump flow, T50 flow, V-funnel, L-box, and J-ring sieve segregation test. Moreover, the hardened properties of concrete were performed for compressive, splitting tensile and flexural strength and permeability of SCC mixtures. Fresh concrete test results show that even if no viscosity modifier is required, satisfactory fresh concrete properties of SCC can be obtained by replacing the fine aggregate with coal bottom ash content. At 15% replacement of cement with local metakaolin is optimum and gave better results as compared to control SCC. At 30% replacement of fine aggregate is optimum and gave better results as compared to control SCC. In the combined mix, 10% replacement of cement with metakaolin combined with 30% replacement of fine aggregate with coal bottom ash is optimum and gave better results as compared to control SCC.","Keerio, Manthar Ali; Saand, Abdullah; Kumar, Aneel; Bheel, Naraindas; Ali, Karm",Environmental science and pollution research international,99,1

DESIGN In this scoping review, six databases and grey literature sources were systematically searched for articles reporting HCX of patients with CHF in Germany that were published between 2008 and 2018. Extracted results were summarised using quantitative and qualitative descriptive analysis. RESULTS Of the 18 studies (100%) that met the inclusion criteria, most were observational studies (60%) that evaluated findings quantitatively (60%). HCX were often concerned with patient information, global satisfaction as well as relationships and communication between patients and providers and generally covered ambulatory care, hospital care and rehabilitation services. Overall, the considerable heterogeneity of the included studies' outcomes only permitted relatively trivial levels of synthesis. CONCLUSION In Germany, research on HCX of patients with CHF is characterised by missing, inadequate and insufficient information. Future research would benefit from qualitative analyses, evidence syntheses, longitudinal analyses that investigate HCX throughout the disease trajectory, and better reporting of sociodemographic data. Furthermore, research should include studies that are based on digital data, reports of experiences gained in under-investigated yet patient-relevant healthcare settings and include more female subjects.","Dieckelmann, Mirjam; Petersen, Juliana J; Güthlin, Corina; Reinhardt, Felix; Plath, Jasper; Jeitler, Klaus; Semlitsch, Thomas; Gerlach, Ferdinand M; Siebenhofer, Andrea",BMJ open,99,1

We centralized paediatric traumatology supposing a reduction of ER admissions, with increased severity of conditions, and a change in fracture patterns and consequently re-organized our structure. The COVID-19 epidemic in Europe has seen Italy as the first focus starting from the 21st of February 2020. Lombardy has been the most affected area. The initial NHS approach determined a high percentage of hospital admissions that led to early overload of hospitals, and we had to reorganize our structure to face the emergency. METHODS We retrospectively evaluated the admission and treatment data to observe the epidemiological evolution of paediatric trauma during the lockdown ordinance and compared them with the same period in 2019. RESULTS We found a reduction of 78% paediatric visits in the ER but no decrease in the amount of paediatric fractures, rather we found a rate of paediatric fractures increased by 21,62 %. The upper limb fractures being the most representative. CONCLUSIONS Our expectations were confirmed. We believe that the reorganization and the guidelines by us designed has been effective to spare resources and subtract the paediatric traumatology load from those hospitals dealing with an unexpected number of critical COVID-19 patients. Even if we experienced a significant reduction of paediatric admissions to our trauma E.R., the presence of a determined number of fractures justifies the necessity of a specialized hub to collect all paediatric fractures.","Memeo, Antonio; Priano, Daniele; Caldarini, Camilla; Trezza, Paolo; Laquidara, Melania; Montanari, Lucrezia; Randelli, Pietro",Minerva pediatrica,99,5

Recent reviews and studies have indicated that FGIDs and related signs and symptoms may also have a substantial impact on the budgets of third-party payers and/or parents. The objective of this systematic review is to investigate these costs. METHODS AND ANALYSIS The population of interest is healthy term infants (under 12 months of age) with colic, regurgitation and/or functional constipation. Outcomes of interest will include the frequency and volume of reported treatments, the cost to third-party payers and/or parents for prescribed or over the counter treatments, visits to health professionals and changes in infant formula purchases, and the loss of income through time taken off work and out of pocket costs. Relevant studies will be identified by searching databases from 2005 onwards (including MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, NEXIS, DARE, Health Technology Assessment database, National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database and others), conferences from the previous 3 years and scanning reference lists of eligible studies. Study selection, data extraction and quality assessment will be conducted by two independent reviewers and disagreements resolved in discussion with a third reviewer. Quality assessment will involve study design-specific checklists. Relevant studies will be summarised narratively and presented in tables. An overview of treatments and costs will be provided, with any geographical or other differences highlighted.

Given the higher probability of thrombotic complications related to COVID-19 and the availability of a dual-layer spectral computed tomography (CT) scanner, we have recently adopted the use of low-dose, non-gated, chest CT scans performed five minutes after contrast administration among patients admitted with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) undergoing cerebrovascular CT angiography. Dual-layer spectral CT comprises a single X-ray source and two-layer detector with different photon-absorption capabilities. In addition to conventional images, the two distinct energy datasets obtained enable multiparametric spectral analysis without need to change the original scanning protocol. The two spectral features that emerge as most useful for patients with AIS are virtual monoenergetic imaging and iodine-based results. Aside from the evaluation of lung parenchyma, this novel strategy enables ruling out cardioembolic sources and simultaneously providing evidence of pulmonary and myocardial injury in a single session and immediately after CT cerebrovascular angiography. Furthermore, it involves a noninvasive, seemingly accurate, unsophisticated, safer (very low radiation dose and no contrast administration), and cheaper tool for ruling out cardioembolic sources compared to transesophageal echocardiogram and cardiac CT. Accordingly, we sought to standardize the technical aspects and overview the usefulness of delayed-phase, lowdose chest spectral CT in patients admitted with AIS.","Rodriguez-Granillo, Gaston A; Cirio, Juan J; Ciardi, Celina; Caballero, Maria L; Diluca, Pablo; Castrillon, Ricardo; Ceron, Marcos; Scrivano, Esteban; Lylyk, Pedro",Minerva cardiology and angiology,99,31

Treatment of acute viral infections with exogenous interferon may be effective but is generally not feasible for clinical use due to many factors, including cost, stability, and availability. To overcome these limitations, an adenovirus type 5-vectored consensus alpha IFN, termed DEF201, was constructed as a potential way to deliver sustained therapeutic levels of systemic IFN. To demonstrate the efficacy of DEF201 against acute flaviviral disease, various concentrations of the construct were administered as a single intranasal dose prior to virus infection, which resulted in a dose-responsive, protective effect in a hamster model of yellow fever virus (YFV) disease. A DEF201 dose of 5×10(7) PFU/animal administered intranasally just prior to YFV challenge protected 100% of the animals, while a 10-fold lower DEF201 dose exhibited lower, although significant, levels of protection. Virus titers in the liver and serum and levels of serum alanine aminotransferase were all significantly reduced as a result of DEF201 administration at all doses tested. No toxicity, as indicated by weight loss or gross morbidity, was observed in non-YFV-infected animals treated with DEF201. Protection of YFV-infected animals was observed when DEF201 was delivered as early as 7 days prior to virus challenge and as late as 2 days after virus challenge, demonstrating effective prophylaxis and therapy in a hamster model of disease. Overall, it appears that DEF201 is effective in the treatment of YFV in a hamster model.","Julander, Justin G; Ennis, Jane; Turner, Jeffrey; Morrey, John D",Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,99,32

This scoping review aimed to address this gap by describing social and behavioural interventions to engage family members in maternal and child nutrition in low- and middle-income countries. We systematically searched PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Global Health and CINAHL for peer-reviewed studies meeting inclusion criteria. We screened 6,570 abstracts, evaluated 179 full-text articles, and included 87 articles from 63 studies.

Interventions were facility and community based; included individual and group-based interpersonal communication, community mobilization, mass media and mHealth; and reached mothers and family members together or separately. Most interventions were located within the health sector; rare exceptions included nutrition-sensitive agriculture, social protection, early child development and community development interventions. Few interventions addressed gender norms, decision-making, and family dynamics or described formative research or theories informing intervention design.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Five beagles with nine artificial tumors were used for validation. The Veran IG4 EM navigation system and a custom-made Kinect-Optical navigation system were used. Needle insertions into each tumor were conducted with these two guidance methods. The target positioning error (TPE) and the time cost of the puncture procedures were evaluated. RESULTS A total of 18 needle insertions were performed to evaluate the navigation accuracy of the two guidance approaches. The targeting error was 6.78 ± 3.22 mm and 8.72 ± 3.5 mm for the Kinect-Optical navigation system and the EM navigation system, respectively. There is no statistically significant difference in the TPE between the Kinect-Optical navigation system and the EM navigation system (p = 0.229). The processing time with the Kinect-Optical system (10 min) is similar to that of the Veran IG4 system (12 min). CONCLUSIONS The accuracy of the Kinect-Optical navigation system is comparable to that of the EM navigation system.","Xiao, Deqiang; Li, Yong; Luo, Huoling; Zhang, Yanfang; Guo, Xuejun; Zheng, Huimin; Hu, Qingmao; Jia, Fucang",Abdominal radiology,99,1

Education that supports parents in learning new information and gaining confidence is essential for intervention success. We conducted a pilot study to test an eHealth program to determine if we could implement the program with adherence and affect important behavioural outcomes compared to treatment as usual. DESIGN Randomised controlled trial. STUDY SAMPLE Parents of children birth to 42 months who use hearing aids. Eighty-two parents were randomly assigned to the intervention or treatment-as-usual group. Four parents assigned to the intervention group did not continue after baseline testing. RESULTS The intervention was delivered successfully with low drop out (10%), high session completion (97%), and high program adherence. The intervention conditions showed significantly greater gains over time for knowledge, confidence, perceptions, and monitoring related to hearing aid management.

METHODS This is a prospective cohort study in an urban pediatric emergency department of patients 4 to 18 years requiring sedation and analgesia for painful procedures of short duration. Patients received fentanyl 1 μg/kg followed by intravenously administered etomidate 0.1 to 0.2 mg/kg as a loading dose. An additional dose of etomidate 0.1 mg/kg was intravenously administered if needed. The level of sedation was determined by The Children's Hospital of Wisconsin Sedation Score. The primary outcome was to determine the etomidate dose associated with an adequate level of sedation and procedural completion. RESULTS Sixty patients were enrolled. The most frequent procedure was fracture reduction (50/60, 83.3%). Procedures were successfully completed for 59 (98.3%) of 60 patients. The initial dose of etomidate associated with adequate sedation was 0.2 mg/kg intravenously administered for 33 (66.7%) of 50 patients requiring fracture reduction and for 6 (60.0%) of 10 patients receiving a procedure other than fracture reduction. Respiratory depression was noted in 9 (16.4%) of 55 patients, and oxygen desaturation was noted in 23 (39.0%) of 59 patients. Of 58 patients, 21 (36.2%) experienced a respiratory adverse event requiring brief intervention including oxygen supplementation, stimulation, and/or airway repositioning. No patient experienced a significant adverse respiratory event, defined as positive pressure ventilation. Median time to discharge-ready was 21 minutes. CONCLUSIONS For short-duration painful emergency department procedures, etomidate 0.2 mg/kg intravenously administered after fentanyl was associated with effective sedation, successful procedural completion, and readily managed respiratory adverse events in children.","Mandt, Maria J; Roback, Mark G; Bajaj, Lalit; Galinkin, Jeffrey L; Gao, Dexiang; Wathen, Joseph E",Pediatric emergency care,99,24

The frequency of 14 associated symptoms both within and outside the pelvis was determined. Patients and methods Symptom questionnaires were completed by 168 women with dysmenorrhea, allocated to three groups based on their diagnostic status for endometriosis confirmed (Endo+), endometriosis excluded (Endo-), or endometriosis diagnosis unknown (No Lap). Those with endometriosis confirmed were further divided into current users (Endo+ Hx+) and non-users of hormonal treatments (Endo+ Hx-). Users of hormonal treatments were further divided into users (Endo+ Hx+ LIUCD+) and non-users (Endo+ Hx+ LIUCD-) of a levonorgestrel-releasing intra-uterine contraceptive device (LIUCD). The frequency and number of symptoms within groups and the effect of previous distressing sexual events were sought. Results Women with and without endometriosis lesions had similar symptom profiles, with a mean of 8.5 symptoms per woman. Only 0.6% of women reported dysmenorrhea alone. The presence of stabbing pelvic pains was associated with more severe dysmenorrhea (P=0.006), more days per month of dysmenorrhea (P=0.003), more days per month of pelvic pain (P=0.016), and a diagnosis of migraine (P=0.054). The symptom profiles of the Endo+ Hx+ and Endo+ Hx- groups were similar. A history of distressing sexual events was associated with an increased number of pain symptoms (P=0.003). Conclusion Additional symptoms are common in women with dysmenorrhea, and do not correlate with the presence or absence of endometriosis lesions. Our study supports the role of central sensitization in the pain of dysmenorrhea. The presence of stabbing pelvic pains was associated with increased severity of dysmenorrhea, days per month of dysmenorrhea, days per month of pelvic pain, and a diagnosis of migraine headache. A past history of distressing sexual events is associated with an increased number of pain symptoms.","Evans, Susan F; Brooks, Tiffany A; Esterman, Adrian J; Hull, M Louise; Rolan, Paul E",Journal of pain research,99,16

Sacral neuromodulation (SNM) might improve voiding symptoms by treating dysfunctional voiding. The aim of this study is to report our experience with SNM in patients treated with surgery for DIE. METHODS We retrospectively enrolled 13 patients with VS/Ds after surgery for DIE. All patients were investigated with urodynamic studies (UDS) and agreed to undergo SNM. Pre-existing VS/Ds, bowel disorders and pelvic pain, DIE surgical procedures, UDS and SNM test results were recorded. RESULTS After surgery for DIE, functional bladder outflow obstruction and detrusor acontractility were observed in nine and four patients, respectively. Chronic pelvic pain was present in seven cases. Twelve patients developed constipation, whilst one patient had de novo faecal incontinence. After the SNM testing period, nine patients (69.2%) experienced a significant improvement of symptoms that led to definitive implant. Four patients (30.8%) had no symptom relief and the system was removed. CONCLUSIONS Functional bladder outflow obstruction and urinary retention are the most common VS/Ds after surgery for DIE. SNM may be an effective option for these patients, probably due to its action in improving the dysfunctional voiding, which was likely to be already present as part of the ""endometriotic syndrome"" and got worse after pelvic surgery. Results for pelvic pain control and gastrointestinal disorders should not be underestimated.","Agnello, Marco; Vottero, Mario; Bertapelle, Paola",International urogynecology journal,99,31

METHODS This study included a total of 17 patients with severe total pelvic organ prolapse, including five patients with combined stress urinary incontinence (SUI). Panhysterectomy was performed, and then a porcine SIS patch was placed on the anterior (posterior) vaginal wall. The top of the vaginal wall was moved to the corresponding side of the vaginal wall, and the patch was sutured to bilateral uterosacral ligaments, the sacrospinous ligament, and arcus tendineus fasciae pelvis. SUI was addressed at the same time. 'Failure' was defined as anterior or posterior wall prolapse beyond the hymen. RESULTS The mean follow-up duration was 11.6 ± 7.45 months (2-24 months). No symptom recurrence was observed in the five patients with combined SUI. One patient who underwent porcine SIS patch placement on the posterior wall experienced stage II anterior vaginal wall prolapse after surgery. The vaginal wall and fornix of the remaining patients with patches were restored to stable anatomical positions (92.85%). No organ damage, infection, erosion, or rejection was observed, and no blood transfusion was necessary. CONCLUSION This study is the first to implement total pelvic anatomical repair using a complete and non-splice SIS. Our results suggest that this new surgical method is safe and can achieve satisfactory therapeutic effects, especially for patients with combined SUI.","Liang, Xianghua; Zhang, Lili; Lv, Yanwei",The journal of obstetrics and gynaecology research,99,22

A recent study showed that aspirin was associated with improved survival in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) who were treated with surgery. Objective To examine whether use of NSAIDs during definitive chemoradiation therapy (CRT) was associated with improved outcomes in patients with HNSCC. Design, Setting, and Participants This cohort study analyzed patients with HNSCC who were treated with CRT at a single institution between January 1, 2005, and August 1, 2017. Patient and tumor characteristics included age, race/ethnicity, smoking status, alcohol use, comorbidities (respiratory, cardiovascular, immune, renal, endocrine), disease stage, human papillomavirus status, and treatment duration. Data were analyzed from May 1, 2019, to March 17, 2020. Exposures Patients were dichotomized by NSAID use during treatment. Main Outcomes and Measures The association of NSAID use with patterns of failure, disease-specific survival (DSS), and overall survival (OS) was examined using multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression models. Survival estimates for OS and DSS were generated using Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Results A total of 460 patients (median [interquartile range] age, 60 [53.9-65.6] years; 377 [82.0%] men) were included in the analysis. Among these patients, 201 (43.7%) were taking NSAIDs during treatment. On univariate analysis, NSAID use (hazard ratio [HR], 0.63; 95% CI, 0.43-0.92; P = .02) was associated with better OS. On Cox regression analysis, after backward selection adjustment for potentially confounding factors (age, smoking status, primary tumor site, human papillomavirus status, diabetes, stroke, hyperlipidemia), NSAID use remained significantly associated with better OS (HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.38-0.90; P = .02). NSAID use was associated with significantly better OS at 5 years compared with patients who did not take concurrent NSAIDs (63.6% [56 of 88 patients]; 95% CI, 58%-73% vs 56.1% [83 of 148 patients]; 95% CI, 50%-63%; P = .03). NSAID use was not associated with better DSS in univariate (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.48-1.41; P = .47) or multivariate (HR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.57-1.70; P = .44) analysis.

For this study, we compiled studies that investigated prediction error processing in depression and schizophrenia patients and performed a series of meta-analyses. In both groups, positive t-maps of prediction error tend to yield striatum activity across studies. The analysis of negative t-maps of prediction error revealed two large clusters within the right superior and inferior frontal lobes in schizophrenia and the medial prefrontal cortex and bilateral insula in depression. The concordant posterior cingulate activity was observed in both patient groups, more prominent in the depression group and absent in the healthy control group.

METHODS A retrospective review was conducted on patients undergoing robotic pulmonary resections from October 2011 to December 2014. The operating time, including the docking and console times, postoperative hospitalization, and peri- and postoperative complications were studied. RESULTS Hundred patients underwent 102 robotic anatomic pulmonary resections due to various pathologies. Fifty-three percent of the patients underwent lobectomy procedure, whereas 45% underwent segmentectomy. The mean operating time was 104 ± 34 min. The learning curve was calculated to be 14 patients (R(2) = 0.57).

We explored the use of a remote patient monitoring (RPM) program to care for such outpatients. METHODS Consecutive patients who were tested for COVID-19 because of symptom onset but were clinically stable were offered enrollment into a pilot RPM program. Patients were provided equipment for vital sign measurements and a computer tablet to enter results three times per day. The results were monitored centrally by clinical staff. The goal was to closely monitor patients and escalate care as warranted. RESULTS Between March and June of 2020, 29 patients were approached and 26 were enrolled. The mean age was 57 years old (range, 30-88), 14 were women, and patients remained in the program for an average of 16 days (range, 2-63). Twenty-four patients (83%) were on active anticancer therapy. During that time period, only one patient was admitted to the hospital for worsening respiratory symptoms. The percentage of days during which at least one set of data and all three sets of data were entered was 97.2% and 65.7%, respectively. There was no association between the demographic factors of age, sex, or the reason for being monitored with the level of engagement (P > .05).

Endovascular rescue therapies (ERT) have proven beneficial in selected cases. However, angioplasty (AP) and intraarterial lysis (IAL) are measures of last resort and prospective, quantitative results regarding the efficacy (cerebral oxygenation, metabolism) are largely lacking. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the efficacy of ERTs for medically refractory vasospasm using multimodal, continuous event neuromonitoring. METHODS To detect cerebral compromise in a timely fashion, sedated patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage received continuous neuromonitoring (p ti O 2 measurement, intraparenchymal microdialysis). ERT (AP and/or IAL) was considered in cases of clinically relevant vasospasm refractory to conservative treatment measures. Oxygen saturation and cerebral and systemic metabolism before and after events of ERT was recorded. RESULTS We prospectively included 13 consecutive patients and recorded a total of 25 ERT events: AP (n = 10), IAL (n = 11), or both (AP + IAL, n = 4). Average cerebral p ti O 2 was 10 ± 11 torr before and 49 ± 22 torr after ERT ( P < .001), with a lactate-pyruvate ratio decreasing from 146.6 ± 119.0 to 27.9 ± 10.7 after ERT ( P < .001). Comparable improvement was observed for each type of intervention (AP, IAL, or both). No significant alterations in systemic metabolism could be detected after ERT. CONCLUSION Multimodal event neuromonitoring is able to quantify treatment efficacy in subarachnoid hemorrhage-related vasospasm. In our small cohort of highly selected cases, ERT was associated with improvement in cerebral oxygenation and metabolism with reasonable outcome. Event neuromonitoring may facilitate individual and timely optimization of treatment modality according to the individual clinical course.","Albanna, Walid; Weiss, Miriam; Müller, Marguerite; Brockmann, Marc Alexander; Rieg, Annette; Conzen, Catharina; Clusmann, Hans; Höllig, Anke; Schubert, Gerrit Alexander",Neurosurgery,99,27

The strongest peak of OH appeared for Ag/β-MnO2, while no OH or O2‾ signal was found over Ag/α-MnO2. Through analysis of electron spin resonance (ESR) and Ag(+) elution results, it could be deduced that the toxicity of Ag(+) eluted from Ag/MnO2 nanomaterials and ROS played the main roles during the bactericidal process. Silver showed the highest dispersion on the surface of β-MnO2, which promoted ROS formation and the increase of bactericidal activity. Experimental results also indicated that Ag/MnO2 induced the production of intracellular ROS and disruption of the cell wall and cell membrane.","Wang, Lian; He, Hong; Zhang, Changbin; Sun, Li; Liu, Sijin; Wang, Shaoxin",Journal of environmental sciences,99,31

There is a need for psychometrically sound and feasible measures that assess emotional eating in children and adolescents. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the convergent and discriminant validity of the 10-item Emotional Eating Scale Adapted for Children and Adolescents (EES-C) Short-Form in a community sample of adolescents. We also sought to assess the reliability and structural validity of this measure. METHODS Participants were 128 adolescents ages 13 to 19 years (mean age = 15.10 years; SD = 2.09; 53.9% female). Most participants fell within the healthy BMI range (58.6%). Participants completed the EES-C Short-Form, the loss of control eating section of the Questionnaire on Eating and Weight Patterns-Adolescent Version 5, the Gratitude Questionnaire-Six-Item Form, and a demographic questionnaire. RESULTS Convergent validity of the EES-C Short-Form was supported in that adolescents who endorsed loss of control eating reported significantly greater levels of emotional eating (mean = 24.37; SD = 8.94) compared to adolescents who did not endorse loss of control eating (mean = 19.42; SD = 7.33; p ≤ .01; d = 0.61). The EES-C Short-Form was significantly correlated with a subjective measure of loss of control eating (rs = -0.255; p = .004), further demonstrating convergent validity. The EES-C Short-Form exhibited discriminant validity as demonstrated by a small, non-significant correlation with the Gratitude Questionnaire-Six-Item Form (rs = 0.086; p = .347). The EES-C Short-Form demonstrated acceptable reliability (Cronbach's alpha = 0.84; Ordinal alpha = 0.88; Coefficient omega = 0.85) and a unidimensional factor structure (CFI = 0.98; NNFI = 0.98; RMSEA = 0.08). CONCLUSIONS These data contribute to the existing research that support the EES-C Short-Form as a reliable and valid measure for assessing emotional eating in children and adolescents.","Limbers, Christine A; Greenwood, Emma; Horan, Madeline R",Eating behaviors,99,29

Blood was collected from 267 Imperial Cormorants and 106 Rock Shags at 17 colonies along the Patagonia Atlantic shore during nine breeding seasons (1994, 1999-2001-2005-2008-2010). Antibodies to four pathogens were common to both species and frequently observed: avian paramyxovirus type 1 (56% of Imperial Cormorants and 56% of Rock Shags); avian adenovirus (67% of Imperial Cormorants and 40% of Rock Shags); infectious bronchitis virus serotypes IBV-41, IBV-46, IBV-99, and IBV-JMK (53% of Imperial Cormorants and 64% of Rock Shags); and Salmonella pullorum (18% of Imperial Cormorants and 7% of Rock Shags). Antibody prevalence for these pathogens varied significantly between species, except for avian paramyxovirus type 1. Exposure to avian paramyxovirus type 1 and all serotypes of infectious bronchitis virus varied significantly among seasons in both species. In contrast, the sporadic occurrence of positive titers suggest that cormorants had occasional exposure to Aspergillus spp. (3% of Rock Shags, only in 2000), avian paramyxovirus type 3 (5% of Rock Shags, only in 2008), Chlamydophila spp. (1% of Imperial Cormorants, only in 2010), and avian reovirus (1% of Rock Shags, only in 1999; 29% of Imperial Cormorants, in 2008 and 2010). Both species were antibody negative for avian encephalomyelitis virus, avian influenza virus, avian laryngotracheitis virus, avian paramyxovirus type 2, and infectious bursal disease virus. We provide the first information on pathogen exposure, indicated by detection of antibody in blood samples, for two sympatric species of South Atlantic cormorants. To determine major causes of morbidity and mortality in these birds future efforts should focus on necropsy surveys in cormorant colonies.","Gallo, Luciana; Quintana, Flavio; Uhart, Marcela",Journal of wildlife diseases,99,1

We reported no statistically significant difference in EuroQol Group 5-Dimension Self-Report Questionnaire score between the intervention and control groups, but deaths were not included. Aims Reanalyze the effect of intra-arterial treatment for large vessel occlusion in acute ischemic stroke patients on health-related quality of life in more detail. We now include patients who died during follow-up. Methods The EuroQol Group 5-Dimension Self-Report Questionnaire questionnaires were obtained 90 days after treatment. We used the Dutch tariff to derive a utility index from the EuroQol Group 5-Dimension Self-Report Questionnaire score. Treatment effect was estimated with the Mann-Whitney U test and linear regression. The effect of treatment on the distribution of EuroQol Group 5-Dimension Self-Report Questionnaire dimension scores was assessed with ordinal logistic regression. Results We obtained EuroQol Group 5-Dimension Self-Report Questionnaire scores from 457 (91.7%) of the 500 patients, including 108 who died before follow-up. Median EuroQol Group 5-Dimension Self-Report Questionnaire score in the intervention group was 0.57, and 0.39 in the control group (p = 0.03). Treatment effect estimated with linear regression was 0.07 (95%CI: -0.001 to 0.143).

Water samples were collected in three sites: in the Tatra National Park (TNP), by the sewage discharge from the local treatment plant (STP) and c.a. 3 km downstream (DSTP). The analyses included determination of antibiotic content, enumeration of bacterial indicators of poor water quality, isolation and identification of Escherichia coli, which was subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility tests and assessment of ESBL-determining genes. Fourteen antimicrobials out of 24 tested were detected in river waters in varying concentrations. Trimethoprim and ofloxacin were most frequently detected. Most antibiotics were absent in the TNP, the highest numbers and the highest concentrations of antibiotics were observed by the STP discharge to decrease their content downstream. Culture-based tests of microbiological contamination showed similar results. Resistance to ampicillin was most frequent (64.5% strains), followed by cefazolin (50%). 20.6% of strains were ESBL-positive, while ESBL-determining gene, blaTEM was detected in 23.8% of E. coli strains. The largest percentage of antibiotic resistant and MDR E. coli strains was detected nearby the STP, indicating that malfunctioning STP may contribute largely to river water contamination downstream, also having significant environmental and economic impact.","Lenart-Boroń, Anna; Prajsnar, Justyna; Guzik, Maciej; Boroń, Piotr; Chmiel, Maria",Environmental research,99,1

The method tracks and forecasts a range of values across environmental, social, economic and technical domains by attaching these to material-flows, thus building upon and integrating unidimensional models such as material flow analysis (MFA) and lifecycle assessment (LCA). We argue that the usual classification of metrics into these separate domains is useful for interpreting the outputs of multidimensional assessments, but unnecessary for modelling. We thus suggest that multidimensional assessments can be better performed by integrating the calculation methods of unidimensional models rather than their outputs. To achieve this, we propose a new metric typology that forms the foundation of a multidimensional model. This enables dynamic simulations to be performed with material-flows (or values in any domain) driven by changes in value in other domains. We then apply the model in an illustrative case highlighting links between the UK coal-based electricity-production and concrete/cement industries, investigating potential impacts that may follow the increased use of low-carbon fuels (biomass and solid recovered fuels; SRF) in the former. We explore synergies and trade-offs in value across domains and regions, e.g. how changes in carbon emissions in one part of the system may affect mortality elsewhere. This highlights the advantages of recognising complex system dynamics and making high-level inferences of their effects, even when rigorous analysis is not possible. We also indicate how changes in social, environmental and economic 'values' can be understood as being driven by changes in the technical value of resources. Our work thus emphasises the advantages of building fully integrated models to inform conventional sustainability assessments, rather than applying hybrid approaches that integrate outputs from parallel models. The approach we present demonstrates that this is feasible and lays the foundations for such an integrated model.","Millward-Hopkins, Joel; Busch, Jonathan; Purnell, Phil; Zwirner, Oliver; Velis, Costas A; Brown, Andrew; Hahladakis, John; Iacovidou, Eleni",The Science of the total environment,99,17

We tested this research question with publicly available data on COVID-19 deaths in the United States as of May 5, 2020 and found that states with women governors had fewer COVID-19 deaths compared to states with men governors. Governor sex also interacted with early stay-at-home orders; states with women governors who issued these orders early had fewer deaths compared to states with men governors who did the same. To provide insight into psychological mechanisms of this relationship, we conducted a qualitative analysis of governor briefings that took place between April 1, 2020 and May 5, 2020 (251 briefings, 38 governors, 1.2 million words).

Candidemia, a fungal healthcare-associated infection, has been described in patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19. However, studies of candidemia and COVID-19 co-infection have been limited in sample size and geographic scope. We assessed differences in patients with candidemia with and without a COVID-19 diagnosis. METHODS We conducted a case-level analysis using population-based candidemia surveillance data collected through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Emerging Infections Program during April-August 2020 to compare characteristics of candidemia patients with and without a positive test for COVID-19 in the 30 days before their Candida culture using chi-square or Fisher exact tests. RESULTS Of the 251 candidemia patients included, 64 (25.5%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Liver disease, solid organ malignancies, and prior surgeries were each >3 times more common in patients without COVID-19 co-infection, whereas intensive care unit-level care, mechanical ventilation, having a central venous catheter, and receipt of corticosteroids and immunosuppressants were each >1.3 times more common in patients with COVID-19. All cause in-hospital fatality was two times higher among those with COVID-19 (62.5%) than without (32.1%). CONCLUSIONS One quarter of candidemia patients had COVID-19. These patients were less likely to have certain underlying conditions and recent surgery commonly associated with candidemia and more likely to have acute risk factors linked to COVID-19 care, including immunosuppressive medications. Given the high mortality, it is important for clinicians to remain vigilant and take proactive measures to prevent candidemia in patients with COVID-19.","Seagle, Emma E; Jackson, Brendan R; Lockhart, Shawn R; Georgacopoulos, Ourania; Nunnally, Natalie S; Roland, Jeremy; Barter, Devra M; Johnston, Helen L; Czaja, Christopher A; Kayalioglu, Hazal; Clogher, Paula; Revis, Andrew; Farley, Monica M; Harrison, Lee H; Davis, Sarah Shrum; Phipps, Erin C; Tesini, Brenda L; Schaffner, William; Markus, Tiffanie M; Lyman, Meghan M",Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,99,16

Elevations in extracellular glucose (hyperglycemia) potentiate vascular L-type Ca2+ channel via PKA, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Here, we find that cAMP synthesis in response to elevated glucose and the selective P2Y11 agonist NF546 is blocked by disruption of A-kinase anchoring protein 5 (AKAP5) function in arterial myocytes. Glucose and NF546-induced potentiation of L-type Ca2+ channels, vasoconstriction and decreased blood flow are prevented in AKAP5 null arterial myocytes/arteries. These responses are nucleated via the AKAP5-dependent clustering of P2Y11/ P2Y11-like receptors, AC5, PKA and CaV1.2 into nanocomplexes at the plasma membrane of human and mouse arterial myocytes.

METHODS The Vizient database was used to identify patients who underwent elective laparoscopic HHR between October 2014 and June 2018. Patients were grouped according to surgeon's specialty (GS vs. TS). Patient demographics and outcomes including in-hospital mortality were compared between groups. RESULTS During the study period 13,764 patients underwent HHR by either GS or TS. GS performed 9930 (72%) cases while TS performed 3834 (28%) cases. There was no significant difference between GS versus TS with regard to serious morbidity (1.28% vs. 1.30%, p = 0.97) or mortality (0.10% vs. 0.21%, p = 0.19).

Compared to bacterial studies, laboratory and analytical methods to study the entirety of viral communities in clinical samples are rudimentary and need further refinement. In order to address this need, we developed Virobiome-Seq, a sequence capture method and an accompanying bioinformatics analysis pipeline, that identifies viral reads in human samples. Virobiome-Seq is able to enrich for and detect multiple types of viruses in human samples, including novel subtypes that diverge at the sequence level. In addition, Virobiome-Seq is able to detect RNA transcripts from DNA viruses and may provide a sensitive method for detecting viral activity in vivo. Since Virobiome-Seq also yields the viral sequence, it makes it possible to investigate associations between viral genotype and psychiatric illness. In this proof of concept study, we detected HIV1, Torque Teno, Pegi, Herpes and Papilloma virus sequences in Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells, plasma and stool samples collected from individuals with psychiatric disorders. We also detected the presence of numerous novel circular RNA viruses but were unable to determine whether these viruses originate from the sample or represent contaminants. Despite this challenge, we demonstrate that our knowledge of viral diversity is incomplete and opportunities for novel virus discovery exist. Virobiome-Seq will enable a more sophisticated analysis of the virome and has the potential of uncovering complex interactions between viral activity and psychiatric disease.","Yolken, Robert H; Kinnunen, Paula M; Vapalahti, Olli; Dickerson, Faith; Suvisaari, Jaana; Chen, Ou; Sabunciyan, Sarven",Schizophrenia research,99,17

In China, food safety has emerged as one of the country's most prominent domestic concerns, but there has been limited investment in surveillance, inter-agency coordination, outbreak investigation and data synthesis. After large outbreaks of Salmonella in the 1960s and E. coli O157:H7 in the 1990s, the United States transformed its approach to detecting and investigating foodborne infections, including deployment of a national, laboratory-based surveillance system that uses molecular subtyping. In China, the absence of a national, laboratory-based surveillance system means that it is difficult to rapidly detect a widely dispersed foodborne infection outbreak or the emergence of new foodborne infections. Based on lessons learned in the United States, we propose policy and administrative changes that China can adopt to strengthen detection and control of foodborne infections.","Varma, Jay K; Wu, Shuyu; Feng, Zijian",Global public health,99,24

However, there is a lack of literature that identifies specific components and strategies to include in suicide and risk management protocols (SRMPs) for mental health research. The goal of this scoping review was to review academic and grey literature to determine core components and associated strategies, which can be used to inform SRMPs in mental health research. METHODS AND ANALYSIS The methodological framework outlined by Arksey and O'Malley was used for this scoping review. The search strategy, conducted by a medical librarian, was multidisciplinary and included seven databases. Two reviewers independently assessed eligibility criteria in each document and used a standardized charting form to extract relevant data. The extracted data were then examined using qualitative content analysis. Specifically, summative content analysis was used to identify the core components and strategies used in SRMPs. The data synthesis process was iterative. RESULTS This review included 36 documents, specifically 22 peer-reviewed articles and 14 documents from the grey literature. Five core components of SRMPs emerged from the reviewed literature including: training; educational resources for research staff; educational resources for research participants; risk assessment and management strategies; and clinical and research oversight. Potentials strategies for risk mitigation within each of the core components are outlined. CONCLUSIONS The five core components and associated strategies for inclusion in SRMPs will assist mental health researchers in conducting research safely and rigorously. Findings can inform the development of SRMPs and how to tailor them across various research contexts.","Stevens, Katye; Thambinathan, Vivetha; Hollenberg, Elisa; Inglis, Fiona; Johnson, Andrew; Levinson, Andrea; Salman, Soha; Cardinale, Leah; Lo, Brian; Shi, Jenny; Wiljer, David; Korczak, Daphne J; Cleverley, Kristin",BMC psychiatry,99,19

DESIGN A randomized controlled trial (Canadian Task Force Classification I). SETTING An academic hospital. PATIENTS Forty-six women who underwent laparoscopic hysterectomy from March 2013 to September 2013. INTERVENTIONS Each patient served as her own control. One side of the uterine attachments was desiccated and transected with the single-use device (Ligasure 5-mm Blunt Tip LF1537 with the Force Triad generator). The other side was desiccated and transected with reusable bipolar forceps (RoBi 5 mm), and transected with monopolar scissors using the same Covidien Force Triad generator. The instrument approach used was randomized to the attending physician who was always on the patient's left side. Resident physicians always operated on the patient's right side and used the converse instruments of the attending physician. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Start time was recorded at the utero-ovarian pedicle and end time was recorded after transection of the uterine artery on the same side. Costs included the single-use device; amortized costs of the generator, reusable instruments, and cords; cleaning and packaging of reusable instruments; and disposal of the single-use device. Operating room time was $94.14/min. We estimated that our single use-device cost $630.14 and had a total time savings of 6.7 min per case, or 3.35 min per side, which could justify the expense of the device. The single-use energy device had significant median time savings (-4.7 min per side, p < .001) and total intraoperative direct cost savings ($254.16 per case). CONCLUSIONS A single-use energy device that both desiccates and cuts significantly reduced operating room time to justify its own cost, and it also reduced total intraoperative direct costs during laparoscopic hysterectomy in our institution. Operating room cost per minute varies between institutions and must be considered before generalizing our results.","Holloran-Schwartz, M Brigid; Gavard, Jeffrey A; Martin, Jared C; Blaskiewicz, Robert J; Yeung, Patrick P",Journal of minimally invasive gynecology,99,1

However, Current studies largely concentrate on the effects of a single pollutant (BaP or DBP). The liver is vital for biogenic activities. The eﬀects of BaP and DBP co-exposure on liver remain unclear. Thus, we treated human normal liver cell (L02 cell) with BaP or/and DBP. We found that compared to individual exposure, co-exposure to BaP and DBP induced further increased levels of AST and ALT. BaP and DBP co-exposure caused further increased levels of IL-2, IL-6, and TNF-α, decreased IL-10 level, and a higher percentage of apoptotic cells and S-phase arrest cells. BaP and DBP co-exposure worsen the decrease of miR-122-5p level and chaos of SOCS1/STAT3 signaling. Dual-luciferase reporter gene assays showed that SOCS1 was a validated target of miR-122-5p. miR-122-5p overexpression alleviated the increased SOCS1 expression, decreased phospho-STAT3 expression, decreased IL-10 level, increased TNF-α levels, increased percentage of apoptosis and S-phase arrest, and cytotoxicity induced by BaP and DBP co-exposure in hepatocytes. These results suggested that miR-122-5p negatively regulated the synergistic effects on apoptosis and disorder of inflammatory factor secretion involved in hepatocyte injury caused by BaP and DBP co-exposure through targeting SOCS1/STAT3 signaling.","Liu, Yining; Chen, Wenyan; Chen, Jing; Ma, Yemei; Cen, Yanli; Wang, Shengli; He, Xiu; You, Mingdan; Yang, Guanghong",Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,99,5

We adopt an oft-used tool in mathematical finance, the Heston Stochastic Volatility model, to forecast the short-term and long-term evolution of motor vehicle collision rates. We incorporate a number of extensions to the Heston model to make it fit for modelling motor vehicle collision rates. We incorporate the temporally-unstable and non-deterministic nature of collision rate fluctuations, and introduce a parameter to account for periods of accelerated safety. We also adjust estimates to account for the seasonality of collision patterns. Using these parameters, we perform a short-term forecast of collision rates and explore a number of plausible scenarios using long-term forecasts. The short-term forecast shows a close affinity with realised rates (over 95% accuracy), and outperforms forecasting models currently used in road safety research (Vasicek, SARIMA, SARIMA-GARCH). The long-term scenarios suggest that modest targets to reduce collision rates (1.83% annually) and targets to reduce the fluctuations of month-to-month collision rates (by half) could have significant benefits for road safety. The median forecast in this scenario suggests a 50% fall in collision rates, with 75% of simulations suggesting that an effective change in collision rates is observed before 2044. The main benefit the model provides is eschewing the necessity for setting unreasonable safety targets that are often missed. Instead, the model presents the effects that modest and achievable targets can have on road safety over the long run, while incorporating random variability. Examining the parameters that underlie expected collision rates will aid policymakers in determining the effectiveness of implemented policies.","Shannon, Darren; Fountas, Grigorios",Accident; analysis and prevention,99,31

This video reviews the minimally invasive approaches to preoperatively suspected gallbladder cancer. METHODS Like the standard laparoscopic cholecystectomy, the minimally invasive procedure is performed with four trocars. The surgeon operates with the patient in the French position. A totally laparoscopic radical cholecystectomy including wedge resections of segments IVB and V is undertaken with hepatoduodenal lymphadenectomy and common bile duct excision. The biliary system is reconstructed via a laparoscopic choledochojejunostomy. RESULTS Six patients have undergone laparoscopic radical cholecystectomy. Three of these patients were found to have gallbladder cancer according to the final pathology. All the final surgical margins were negative, and the average lymph node retrieval was 3 (range, 1-6). CONCLUSION The minimally invasive approach to gallbladder cancer is feasible and safe. It should currently be performed in high-volume centers with expertise in both hepatobiliary and minimally invasive surgery.

AIM To investigate the effectiveness of exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) as adjunctive therapy to intravenous corticosteroids in patients with ASUC. METHODS This was an open-label randomised controlled trial, in which patients who were admitted with ASUC between August 2018 and May 2020 were randomised 1:1 to EEN or standard of care (SOC). Patients on EEN received a semi-elemental formula for 7 days along with SOC. The primary outcome was corticosteroid failure, defined by the need for salvage medical therapy or colectomy. Faecal microbial analysis was performed on day 1 and day 7 by 16s ribosomal RNA sequencing in some patients. RESULTS Of 62 patients (mean age 35.3 ± 12.1 years, 40% male), 32 were randomised to EEN and 30 to SOC. Corticosteroid failure was lower on EEN compared to SOC (intention-to-treat analysis 25% vs 43%, P = 0.051; per protocol analysis 19% vs 43%, P = 0.04), without any difference in colectomy rate (9% vs 13%; P = 0.41). Patients on EEN had a shorter hospital stay [median (range) 10 (8-17) vs 13 (8-24) days; P = 0.04], higher day 7 albumin level (34 ± 4 vs 29 ± 3 g/L, P < 0.01), greater reduction in serum C-reactive protein and faecal calprotectin levels (both P = 0.04) and a lower composite outcome of colectomy/hospitalisation at 6 months (16% vs 39%; P = 0.045) compared to SOC. Patients on EEN showed increased abundance of Erysipelotrichaceae on day 7, with reduced Bifidobacterium and Veillonellaceae compared to SOC.

This calculation is then encoded to control the motors and validated in a simulator. The feedback produced by the simulation can be used to correct the code or to implement the code can be implemented directly in the robotic agent. However, the simulation process executes instructions that are not native to the robotic agents, extending development time or making it preferable to validate the code directly on the robot, which in some cases might result in severe damage to it.

Participants randomized to the STAR intervention were hypothesized to demonstrate significantly improved adherence at postintervention and 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up visits compared to the EO intervention. Seizure and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) outcomes were also examined. METHODS Two hundred children with new onset epilepsy and their caregivers were recruited during routine epilepsy clinic visits. Baseline questionnaires were completed, and electronic adherence monitors were provided. Participants with adherence less than 95% during the run-in period were randomized to either STAR or EO intervention. Active intervention was provided to both groups for 4 months. Questionnaires were completed at conclusion of the active intervention phase and three follow-up time points (3, 6, and 12 months). Group differences in adherence, seizure outcomes, and HRQOL were examined using regression-based analyses of covariance and longitudinal mixed effect linear or logistical models. RESULTS Adherence at 12-month follow-up was significantly different between the STAR (mean = 82.34, SD = 21.29) and EO intervention groups (mean = 61.77, SD = 28.29), with the STAR group demonstrating 20.6% greater adherence (b = 19.11, p = .04, 95% confidence interval = 1.00-37.22, d = .83). No significant differences were found between groups in seizure and HRQOL outcomes.

While prior studies have demonstrated disparities in the treatment of back pain and care for osteoporotic patients, disparities in spine augmentation have not been investigated. We investigated racial and health insurance status differences in the use of spine augmentation for the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral fractures in the United States. MATERIALS AND METHODS Using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample from 2005 to 2010, we selected all discharges with a primary diagnosis of vertebral fracture (International Classification of Diseases-9 code 733.13). Patients who received spine augmentation were identified by using International Classification of Diseases-9 procedure code 81.65 for vertebroplasty and 81.66 for kyphoplasty. Patients with a diagnosis of cancer were excluded. We compared usage rates of spine augmentation by race/ethnicity (white, black, Hispanic, and Asian/Pacific Islander) and insurance status (Medicare, Medicaid, self-pay, and private). Comparisons among groups were made by using χ(2) tests. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was fit to determine variables associated with spine augmentation use. RESULTS A total of 228,329 patients were included in this analysis, of whom 129,206 (56.6%) received spine augmentation. Among patients with spine augmentation, 97,022 (75%) received kyphoplasty and 32,184 (25%) received vertebroplasty; 57.5% (92,779/161,281) of white patients received spine augmentation compared with 38.7% (1405/3631) of black patients (P < .001). Hispanic patients had significantly lower spine augmentation rates compared with white patients (52.3%, 3777/7222, P < .001) as did Asian/Pacific Islander patients (53.1%, 1784/3361, P < .001). The spine augmentation usage rate was 57.2% (114,768/200,662) among patients with Medicare, significantly higher than that of those with Medicaid (43.9%, 1907/4341, P < .001) and those who self-pay (40.2%, 488/1214, P < .001).

METHODS Sixty-two cases receiving favipiravir treatment for at least five days due to COVID-19 infection were evaluated retrospectively. Parameters including age, gender, nasopharyngeal swab positivity, and chronic diseases were analyzed. Hematologic parameters were analyzed before and after the treatment. RESULTS The mean age of the patients receiving treatment with favipiravir was 63.7±12.3 years. Nasopharyngeal swab positivity was detected in 67.7%. The most common comorbid conditions detected in patients were hypertension in 25 cases (40.3%) and diabetes in 16 cases (25.8%). In the statistical analysis of the hematological parameters before and after treatment with favipiravir, WBC, PT-PTT-INR levels were found to be unaffected; the mean RBC was found to have decreased from 4.33 ± 0.58 M/uL to 4.16 ± 0.54 M/uL (p:0.003); the median hemoglobin level was found to have decreased from 12.3 g/dl to 11.9 g/dl (p:0.041); the hematocrit level decreased from 38.1% ± 4.8 to 36.9% ± 4.2 (p:0.026); the median neutrophil count decreased from 4.57 K/uL to 3.85 K/uL (p:0.001); the mean lymphocyte count increased from 1.22 ± 0.53 K/uL to 1.84 ± 1.19 K/uL (p:0.000); and the mean platelet count increased from 244.1 ± 85.1 K/uL to 281.9 ± 103.3 K/uL (p:0.005).

This review determined the effect of age on voluntary activation during maximal voluntary isometric contractions (MVC). The literature was systematically reviewed for studies reporting voluntary activation quantified with the interpolated twitch technique (ITT) or central activation ratio (CAR) during isometric contractions in young (18-35 years) and old adults (>60 years, mean ≥65 years). Of the 2,697 articles identified, 54 were eligible for inclusion in the meta-analysis. Voluntary activation was assessed with electrical stimulation (ES) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) on 5 different muscle groups. Random-effects meta-analysis revealed lower activation in old compared with young adults (d=-0.45, 95% CI [-0.62 - -0.29], p<0.001), with moderate heterogeneity (52.4%). To uncover the sources of heterogeneity, subgroup analyses were conducted for muscle group, calculation method (ITT or CAR), and stimulation type (ES or TMS) and number (single, paired or train stimulations). The age-related reduction in voluntary activation occurred for all muscle groups investigated except the ankle dorsiflexors. Both ITT and CAR demonstrated an age-related reduction in voluntary activation of the elbow flexors, knee extensors and plantar flexors. ITT performed with paired and train stimulations showed lower activation for old than young adults with no age difference for the single electrical stimulation. Together, the meta-analysis revealed that healthy older adults have a reduced capacity to activate some upper and lower limb muscles during MVCs; however, the effect was modest and best assessed with at least paired stimulations to detect the difference.","Rozand, Vianney; Sundberg, Christopher W; Hunter, Sandra K; Smith, Ashleigh E",Medicine and science in sports and exercise,99,16

However, there has been no systematic review of the evidence related to the comprehensive role of companion animals and how pets might contribute to the work associated with managing a long-term mental health condition. The aim of this study was to explore the extent, nature and quality of the evidence implicating the role and utility of pet ownership for people living with a mental health condition. METHODS A systematic search for studies exploring the role of companion animals in the management of mental health conditions was undertaken by searching 9 databases and undertaking a scoping review of grey literature from the earliest record until March 2017. To be eligible for inclusion, studies had to be published in English and report on primary data related to the relationship between domestic animal ownership and the management of diagnosable mental health conditions. Synthesis of qualitative and quantitative data was undertaken in parallel using a narrative synthesis informed by an illness work theoretical framework. RESULTS A total of 17 studies were included in the review. Quantitative evidence relating to the benefits of pet ownership was mixed with included studies demonstrating positive, negative and neutral impacts of pet ownership. Qualitative studies illuminated the intensiveness of connectivity people with companion animals reported, and the multi-faceted ways in which pets contributed to the work associated with managing a mental health condition, particularly in times of crisis. The negative aspects of pet ownership were also highlighted, including the practical and emotional burden of pet ownership and the psychological impact that losing a pet has. CONCLUSION This review suggests that pets provide benefits to those with mental health conditions. Further research is required to test the nature and extent of this relationship, incorporating outcomes that cover the range of roles and types of support pets confer in relation to mental health and the means by which these can be incorporated into the mainstay of support for people experiencing a mental health problem.","Brooks, Helen Louise; Rushton, Kelly; Lovell, Karina; Bee, Penny; Walker, Lauren; Grant, Laura; Rogers, Anne",BMC psychiatry,99,27

However, due to their similar morphological characteristics and insufficient molecular identification, the taxonomic classification of black aspergilli remains ill-defined. The production of specialised metabolites is often unique for species among black aspergilli and could be used as diagnostic chemical markers for species identification. In this study, chemical investigation of Aspergillus tubingensis OUCMBIII 143291 led to the discovery of the diagnostic chemical marker asperazine, a complex diketopiperazine heterodimer, as well as two previously undescribed analogues, asperazine B and C. In addition, an undescribed 2-benzylpyridin-4(1H)-one-containing amide, pestalamide D, along with four known related metabolites were isolated. Their chemical structures, including their absolute configurations, were established on the basis of comprehensive spectral analysis and chiral HPLC analysis of the acidic hydrolysates. Asperazines B and C can serve as potential chemical markers for distinguishing A. tubingensis from A. niger, two representative species of black aspergilli that are usually incorrectly identified. Moreover, the isolated compounds were evaluated for their antifungal activity against eight phytopathogenic fungi including Alternaria alternata, A. brassicae, Botrytis cinerea, Colletotrichum lagenarium, Fusarium oxysporum, Gaeumannomyces graminis, Penicillium digitatum, and Valsa mali. Pestalamide D exhibited significant activities against B. cinerea, C. lagenarium, and V. mali, with MIC values of 4, 8, and 8 μg/mL, respectively, compared with the positive controls carbendazim (MICs = 8, 4, and 4 μg/mL) and prochloraz (MICs = 8, 8, and 4 μg/mL). The results of this study reveal two additional chemical markers and provide a powerful tool for the rapid identification of black aspergilli.","Xu, Ce; Xu, Kuo; Yuan, Xiao-Long; Ren, Guang-Wei; Wang, Xiao-Qiang; Li, Wei; Deng, Ning; Wang, Xiu-Fang; Zhang, Peng",Phytochemistry,99,2

Our aim was therefore to compare the airway luminal area between these two positions on computed tomography (CT) and to determine its correlation with forced expiratory volume in 1s (FEV1). MATERIALS AND METHODS Thirty-two asymptomatic volunteers underwent both conventional (supine position) and upright (standing position) CT during deep inspiration breath-holding. Pulmonary function tests were conducted on the same day. We measured the airway luminal area on CT in each position. Paired t-tests and Pearson's correlation coefficients were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS The average luminal areas of the trachea, right and left main bronchi, and average third-generation airway were greater in the standing than the supine position by 3.4%, 6.1%, 5.5%, and 5.2%, respectively. The correlation coefficients between airway luminal areas and FEV1 tended to be higher in the standing than the supine position; this correlation was highest for the average third-generation airway (r=0.70, P <0.0001). CONCLUSION The airway luminal areas of the trachea, bilateral main bronchi, and average third-generation airway were greater in the standing than the supine position.

As of today, little is known about its exact mechanism of action. For a better understanding of the pathophysiology, we investigated the effect of ESWA on microcirculation and leukocyte-endothelial interaction. MATERIALS AND METHODS Intravital fluorescent microscopy was used to quantify microcirculatory parameters in the ears of hairless mice (n = 30). Values were obtained just before and 10 min after the ESWA (500 shots, 1 Hz, duration 500 s). Mice were randomly divided into three groups undergoing different shock wave intensities (energy flux density: control: 0.00 mJ/mm(2); low level: 0.015 mJ/mm(2); and higher level (hl): 0.04 mJ/mm(2); n = 10 mice per group). Histologic evaluations were taken after completion of the experiments. RESULTS A significant increase in the venular diameter was observed in both the groups that underwent ESWA compared with the control group (hl: 118%, low level: 117%, and control: 96%; P < 0.004). Edema formation increased significantly in group I (P = 0.002). ESWA provoked an arteriolar constriction (hl: 93% versus control: 104%; P = 0.019) 10 min after treatment. The highest value of venular blood flow was found in group hl. Moreover, shock waves increased significantly the number of sticking leukocytes immediately after application (hl: 274%, P = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS ESWA has a significant and immediate impact on microcirculation with endothelial integrity loss and increase of adherent leukocytes as part of a proinflammatory process. Although a dilation of venules was caused, arterioles primarily show a constriction. The study shows alterations in microcirculation that could help understand the mechanism of action in the future.","Goertz, Ole; Hauser, Joerg; Hirsch, Tobias; von der Lohe, Leon; Kolbenschlag, Jonas; Stricker, Ingo; Lehnhardt, Marcus; Lauer, Henrik",The Journal of surgical research,99,31

However, differential effects on the microcirculation according to the anesthetic technique used during thoracoscopic surgery have not been well documented. We conducted a randomized clinical trial in which the effects of desflurane and propofol, both with remifentanil, on systemic arterial oxygenation during one-lung ventilation were compared in patients undergoing thoracoscopic surgery. As a subgroup analysis, we compared the effects of two commonly used anesthetic techniques, desflurane-remifentanil (n = 52) and propofol-remifentanil (n = 48), on tissue oxygen saturation using a vascular occlusion test in patients undergoing thoracoscopic surgery. Tissue oxygen saturation was higher in the desflurane than the propofol group (mean ± standard deviation, 83 ± 6 vs. 80 ± 9, 84 ± 6 vs. 76 ± 10, and 87 ± 7 vs. 77 ± 10 % at 30 and 60 min of one-lung ventilation and at two-lung ventilation; adjusted p = 0.026, <0.001, and <0.001, respectively).

Hospital stays after HF have shortened along time. We investigated the association between length of hospital stay after HF and mortality after discharge among persons with AD. METHODS The MEDALZ cohort includes all Finnish community dwellers who received clinically verified AD diagnosis in 2005-2011 (n=70,718). Patients who experienced first HF after AD diagnosis in 2005‒2015 (n=6999) were selected. Length of hospital stay for HF was measured as a sum of the consecutive days spent in hospital after HF until discharge. Outcome was defined as death within 30-days after hospital discharge. RESULTS Mean of overall length of hospital stay after a HF decreased from 52.6 (SD 62.9) days in 2005 to 19.6 (SD 23.1) days in 2015. Shortest treatment decile (1‒4 days) had the highest risk of death within 30 days after discharge (adjusted hazard ratio, aHR, 2.76; 95% confidence interval, CI, 1.66-4.60) in addition to second (5‒6 days; aHR 2.52; 95% CI 1.50-4.23), and third (7‒10 days; aHR 2.22; 95% CI 1.34-3.69) deciles when compared to the sixth decile of length of stays (21‒26 days). CONCLUSIONS Among persons with AD, shorter length of hospital stay after HF was associated with an increased risk of death after discharge. After acute hip fracture treatment, inpatient rehabilitation or proper care and services in home need to be organized to older persons with AD.","Lavikainen, Piia; Koponen, Marjaana; Taipale, Heidi; Tanskanen, Antti; Tiihonen, Jari; Hartikainen, Sirpa; Tolppanen, Anna-Maija","The journals of gerontology.

In order to maximise the benefits on outcomes, GDT must be implemented as early as possible; intravascular volume optimisation should be in accordance with the response of the preload-reserve, goals should be individualised and adequacy of the intervention must be also assessed; non-invasive or minimally invasive monitoring should be used and, finally, side effects of every therapy should be taken into account in order to avoid undesired complications.

STUDY DESIGN Ex vivo study. SAMPLE POPULATION Urinary bladders harvested from ovine (n = 26) cadaveric specimens. METHODS After collection and specimen preparation, a 3-cm-long incision was created on the ventral aspect of the urinary bladder. The cystotomy was repaired with barbed (n = 13) or nonbarbed analogous monofilament absorbable suture (n = 13) in a double-layer inverting suture pattern. Time required for closure in seconds was recorded for each test. Each bladder was connected to a pressure transducer to monitor intraluminal pressure during infusion with dyed Hartmann's solution until leakage occurred. Intraluminal pressure at time of initial leakage and leakage site were also recorded. Two-sample t tests were used to compare initial leakage pressure and closure time between the 2 types of suture (P = .05). RESULTS The mean ( ± SD) leakage pressure of ovine urinary bladder incisions did not differ between closures with barbed sutures (42.3 ± 21.7 mmHg) and nonbarbed closures (32.5 ± 14.4 mmHg, P = .187). Cystorrhaphies were performed faster with barbed suture (307 ± 50 seconds) than with nonbarbed suture (390 ± 62 seconds, P = .001). CONCLUSION The use of barbed suture did not affect mean leakage pressure of ovine urinary bladder incisions but decreased the time required to complete cystorrhaphies in this model. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE This study provides evidence to support the use of knotless barbed suture for open ovine cystorrhaphies. Use of such suture for laparoscopic and laparoscopic-assisted procedures in sheep warrants caution until cyclic and in vivo testing is performed with appropriate laparoscopic instrumentation.","Duffy, Daniel J; Duddy, Hugh R; Keating, Stephanie; Gutierrez-Nibeyro, Santiago D",Veterinary surgery : VS,99,27

Until significant ingrowth occurs integrity of the repair depends solely on mesh overlap and anchoring device. Relatively few studies have addressed the effect of mesh properties and anchoring device on long-term parietal ingrowth. METHODS In 20 sheep, using laparoscopy, we inserted two different polypropylene-based meshes, Physiomesh™ and Ventralight™ ST, anchored with Protack™, SecureStrap™, or Glubran™. After 6 and 12 months, 10 sheep at each time point were euthanized, and we harvested the meshes with corresponding fascia. Mesh with fascia was attached on an Alwetron™ materials testing machine and pulled apart obtaining the peel-off energy (kilojoule (kJ)). RESULTS The strength of parietal ingrowth at 6 months was 5.99 ± 0.54 kJ (mean ± SEM), 4.94 ± 0.54 kJ and 7.35 ± 0.55 kJ when anchored with Protack™, Glubran™, or SecureStrap™, respectively. At 6 months, the strength of parietal ingrowth of SecureStrap™ was significantly higher than Glubran™ (p = 0.04). No significant difference was seen between any other combinations. Parietal ingrowth at 12 months was 7.05 ± 0.56 kJ, 7.55 ± 0.54 kJ, and 5.73 ± 0.54 kJ when anchored with Protack™, Glubran™, and SecureStrap™, respectively. No significant difference in strength of parietal ingrowth was seen between the three types of anchoring, (p = 1.00, p = 1.00, and p = 0.29). CONCLUSIONS At 12 months, the strength of parietal ingrowth was the same for all comparisons. The two polypropylene meshes showed equal strength of parietal ingrowth independent of mesh properties and anchoring devices used.","Harsløf, S; Zinther, N; Harsløf, T; Danielsen, C; Wara, P; Friis-Andersen, H",Langenbeck's archives of surgery,99,20

Finally, we evaluated outcomes stratified by age. DATA SOURCES A systematic review of PubMed, EMBASE, and preprint websites was conducted between January 1, 2020, and December 10, 2020. Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews identification: CRD42020203369. STUDY SELECTION Studies reporting on consecutive in-hospital cardiac arrest with a resuscitation attempt among patients with coronavirus disease 2019. DATA EXTRACTION Two authors independently performed study selection and data extraction. Study quality was assessed with the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Data were synthesized according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews guidelines. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus or through an independent third reviewer. DATA SYNTHESIS Eight studies reporting on 847 in-hospital cardiac arrest were included. In-hospital cardiac arrest incidence varied between 1.5% and 5.8% among hospitalized patients and 8.0-11.4% among patients in ICU. In-hospital cardiac arrest occurred more commonly in older male patients. Most initial rhythms were nonshockable (83.9%, [asystole = 36.4% and pulseless electrical activity = 47.6%]). Return of spontaneous circulation occurred in 33.3%, with a 91.7% in-hospital mortality. In-hospital cardiac arrest events in ICU had higher incidence of return of spontaneous circulation (36.6% vs 18.7%; p < 0.001) and relatively lower mortality (88.7% vs 98.1%; p < 0.001) compared with in-hospital cardiac arrest in non-ICU locations. Patients greater than or equal to 60 years old had significantly higher in-hospital mortality than those less than 60 years (93.1% vs 87.9%; p = 0.019). CONCLUSIONS Approximately, one in 20 patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 received resuscitation for an in-hospital cardiac arrest. Hospital survival after in-hospital cardiac arrest within the ICU was higher than non-ICU locations and seems comparable with prepandemic survival for nonshockable rhythms. Although the data provide guidance surrounding prognosis after in-hospital cardiac arrest, it should be interpreted cautiously given the paucity of information surrounding treatment limitations and resource constraints during the pandemic. Further research is into actual causative mechanisms is needed.","Lim, Zheng Jie; Ponnapa Reddy, Mallikarjuna; Curtis, J Randall; Afroz, Afsana; Billah, Baki; Sheth, Vishad; Hayek, Salim S; Leaf, David E; Miles, Jeremy A; Shah, Priyank; Yuriditsky, Eugene; Jones, Daryl; Shekar, Kiran; Subramaniam, Ashwin",Critical care medicine,99,1

METHODS Between August 2000 and October 2012, transperitoneal dismembered laparoscopic pyeloplasty was carried out in 13 patients with a surgical history of failed prior surgical interventions. Perioperative outcomes as well as long-term results were assessed. These outcomes were compared with those of the same procedure carried out for primary ureteropelvic junction obstruction by a single surgeon during the same study period. RESULTS Laparoscopic transperitoneal pyeloplasty was completed successfully in all cases without converting to open surgery or requiring blood transfusion. The preoperative symptoms in 12 of 13 patients all disappeared soon after the operation. Asymptomatic severe hydronephrosis found in a 2-year-old boy reduced in size postoperatively. When comparing the primary with the secondary laparoscopic pyeloplasty carried out by the same surgeon, the mean operative time was longer (183 vs 241 min, P = 0.002), estimated blood loss was larger (33 vs 66 mL, P = 0.03) and the complication rate was higher (8.8% vs 22.2%, P = 0.01) in the secondary group. Success rates were 97.9% and 100% (P = 0.41) at a mean follow up of 25.9 and 40.0 months (P = 0.14) for the primary and secondary groups, respectively.

Decreases in spatial memory abilities, changes in EEG, structural injuries, and the downregulation of phosphorylated-Ak strain transforming (p-AKT), phosphorylated-calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (p-CaMKII), phosphorylated extracellular signal regulated kinase (p-ERK) and p-CREB was observed 6 h after microwave exposure. Significant differences in the expression of p-CaMKII were found between the S and L groups. The power amplitudes of the EEG waves (θ, δ), levels of structural injuries and the expression of p-AKT, p-CaMK II, p-CREB, and p-ERK1/2 were significantly different in the S and L groups compared to the SL group. Interaction effects between the 2.856 and 1.5 GHz microwaves were found in the EEG and p-CREB changes. Our findings indicated that 2.856 GHz and 1.5 GHz microwave exposure induced a decline in spatial memory, which might be related to p-AKT, p-CaMK II, p-CREB and p-ERK1/2.","Tan, Shengzhi; Wang, Hui; Xu, Xinping; Zhao, Li; Zhang, Jing; Dong, Ji; Yao, Binwei; Wang, Haoyu; Hao, Yanhui; Zhou, Hongmei; Gao, Yabing; Peng, Ruiyun",Scientific reports,99,1

Most physicians prefer anticoagulants over antiplatelet agents for stroke prevention. However, this approach is not evidence-based and antiplatelets might be as safe and as effective. The 'Biomarkers and Antithrombotic Treatment in Cervical Artery Dissection' ('TREAT-CAD') trial (clinicaltrials.gov: NCT02046460) compares Aspirin to oral anticoagulants (vitamin K antagonists) with regard to efficacy and safety by using both clinical and imaging surrogate outcome measures. TREAT-CAD tests the hypothesis, that aspirin is as safe and effective as vitamin K antagonists. Patients and methods TREAD-CAD is a Prospective, Randomised controlled, Open-labelled, multicentre, non-inferiority trial with Blinded assessment of outcome Events (PROBE-design). Key eligibility criteria are (i) clinical symptoms attributable to cervical artery dissection and (ii) verification of the cervical artery dissection diagnosis by established magnetic resonance imaging criteria. Patients are randomised to receive either Aspirin 300 mg daily or vitamin K antagonists for 90 days. Results Primary outcomes are assessed at 14 ± 10 days (magnetic resonance imaging and clinical examination) and at 90 ± 30 days (clinical examinations). The primary endpoint is a composite outcome measure - labelled Cerebrovascular Ischemia, major Hemorrhagic events or Death (CIHD) - and includes (i) occurrence of any stroke (including retinal infarction), (ii) new ischaemic lesions on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, (iii) any major extracranial haemorrhage, (iv) any symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage, (v) any new haemorrhagic lesion visible on paramagnetic-susceptible sequences and (vi) death. Discussion After database closure, (i) central verification of cervical artery dissection diagnosis will be done by two experienced raters, (ii) adjudication of outcome events will be performed by independent adjudication committees, separately for clinical and imaging outcomes. The primary analysis will be done on the per protocol data set. The targeted sample size consists of 169 evaluable patients in the per protocol data set. Conclusion TREAT-CAD is testing the non-inferiority of Aspirin versus vitamin K antagonists treatment in patients with symptomatic cervical artery dissection by combined clinical and magnetic resonance imaging outcomes.","Traenka, Christopher; Gensicke, Henrik; Schaedelin, Sabine; Luft, Andreas; Arnold, Marcel; Michel, Patrik; Kägi, Georg; Kahles, Timo; Nolte, Christian H; Kellert, Lars; Rosenbaum, Sverre; Sztaizel, Roman; Brehm, Alex; Stippich, Christoph; Psychogios, Marios; Lyrer, Philippe; Engelter, Stefan T",European stroke journal,99,12

S protein recognizing and binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor is the key step of viral infection. This review summarized the structure of S protein, and the difference among members of the coronaviridae, especially the different sites between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV S protein sequences. We reconstructed the phylogenetic tree of 18 coronaviruses based on S protein, and detected the conserved motif. We had a further discussion on various promising antiviral compounds, drugs or approaches for treatment. Considering that various virus mutants are rampant around the world, we introduced some SARS-CoV-2 mutants, which are more contagious and spread fast. It indicates the limitations of wide spectrum therapeutic research. We wish the information provided by this review can be helpful to the global battle against SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Zhu, Y",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,99,17

Objectives To establish a baseline reference value for fetal ear length and to assess relationship between fetal ear length and gestational age. Methods Ear length measurements were obtained prospectively from fetuses in 551 normal singleton pregnancies of 15 to 41 weeks gestation. Normal cases were defined as normal sonographic findings during examination plus normal infant post-delivery. The relationship between gestational age (GA) in weeks and fetal ear length (FEL) in millimeters were analyzed by simple linear regression. Correlation of FEL measurements with GA, biparietal diameter (BPD), Head circumference (HC), Abdominal Circumference (AC), Femur Length (FL) and maternal age (MA) were also obtained. Results Linear relationships were found between FEL and GA (FEL=0.872GA-2.972). There was a high correlation between FEL and GA (r = 0.837; P = .001). Good linear relationship and strong positive correlation were demonstrated between FEL and BPD, AC, HC, and FL (p<0.05). Conclusion The result of this study provides normal baseline reference value for FEL. The study also showed good linear relationship and good correlation between FEL and fetal biometric measurements.","Idigo, Felicitas; Ajibo, Kingsley; Anakwue, Angel-Mary; Nwogu, Uloma; Robinson, Ebbi",African health sciences,99,1

This tumor is more common in men than women, with a ratio of 2.7:1. Unlike HCC, Dysplasia is the precancerous nature of liver nodules and is characterized by cellular and nuclear enlargement, nuclear pleomorphism, and multinucleation. Area based Adaptive Expectation Maximization (EM) uses texture, layout, and context features of cells, and grows clusters to obtain texton maps of nucleus. A discriminative model of nucleus and cytoplastic changes of tumor is built by incorporating texture, layout, and context information efficiently. A bootsrap regression model of nuclei and cytoplastic changes are built by incorporating the aforementioned features efficiently. Mean squared error, Peak Signal to Noise ratio and Dice similarity values are used to evaluate the method's classification performance. The proposed method provides high classification and segmentation accuracy of nucleus and extra nuclear content in HCC and dysplasia, which are exceedingly textured in histopathology images, when compared to Adaptive K means, EM method and the state-of-the-art method, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). As texton detection reduces the cluttered background of nuclei, the proposed method would be a convenient mechanism for the classification of nuclei and non-nuclear features. In conclusion, this system can detect more eligible cells of precancerous nature as well as malignant cells even in a cluttered background of nuclei.","Kalinathan, Lekshmi; Kathavarayan, Ruba Soundar; Kanmani, Madheswari; Dinakaran, Nagendram",Histology and histopathology,99,24

However, prolonged exposure to hyperoxia compromises the ability of the macrophage to phagocytose and clear bacteria. Previously, we showed that the exposure of mice to hyperoxia elicits the release of the nuclear protein high mobility group box-1 (HMGB1) into the airways. Extracellular HMGB1 impairs macrophage phagocytosis and increases the mortality of mice infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA). The aim of this study was to determine whether GTS-21 [3-(2,4 dimethoxybenzylidene)-anabaseine dihydrochloride], an α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7nAChR) agonist, could inhibit hyperoxia-induced HMGB1 release into the airways, enhance macrophage function and improve bacterial clearance from the lungs in a mouse model of ventilator-associated pneumonia. GTS-21 (0.04, 0.4 and 4 mg/kg) or saline was systemically administered via intraperitoneal injection to mice that were exposed to hyperoxia (≥99% O2) and subsequently challenged with PA. We found that systemic administration of 4 mg/kg GTS-21 significantly increased bacterial clearance, decreased acute lung injury and decreased accumulation of airway HMGB1. To investigate the cellular mechanism of these observations, RAW 264.7 cells, a macrophagelike cell line, were incubated with different concentrations of GTS-21 in the presence of 95% O2. The phagocytic activity of macrophages was significantly increased by GTS-21 in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, hyperoxia-induced hyperacetylation of HMGB1 was significantly reduced in macrophages incubated with GTS-21. Furthermore, GTS-21 significantly inhibited the cytoplasmic translocation and release of HMGB1 from these macrophages. Our results indicate that GTS-21 is effective in improving bacterial clearance and reducing acute lung injury by enhancing macrophage function via inhibiting the release of nuclear HMGB1. Therefore, the α7nAChR represents a possible pharmacological target to improve the clinical outcome of patients on ventilators by augmenting host defense against bacterial infections.","Sitapara, Ravikumar A; Antoine, Daniel J; Sharma, Lokesh; Patel, Vivek S; Ashby, Charles R; Gorasiya, Samir; Yang, Huan; Zur, Michelle; Mantell, Lin L",Molecular medicine,99,31

The surgical approaches and complications of craniotomies in pigs have not been published before. This study describes how large craniotomies were performed in 46 pigs and how the risk of complications was minimized. The major complications were direct postoperative epidural hematomas (n = 3) and sagittal sinus rupture (n = 4). The measures taken to prevent postoperative epidural hematomas consisted of optimizing anesthesia, using bone wax to stop trabecular bleeding, increasing blood pressure before bone flap replacement, tranexamic acid administration, and postoperative recovery of the pigs in the prone position in a dedicated hammock. After these measures, no pig died from a postoperative epidural hematoma. Iatrogenic sagittal sinus rupture occurred in cases where the dura shifted into the craniotome during craniotomy. The dura was detached from the skull through drill holes with custom elevators before craniotomy to minimize the risk of a sagittal sinus rupture. In conclusion, pigs can undergo craniotomy and survive if the right measures are put in place.","Kinaci, Ahmet; Vaessen, Koen; Redegeld, Saskia; van der Zwan, Albert; van Doormaal, Tristan P C",Laboratory animals,99,1

Evidence from mechanistic data suggests that occupational exposure to ergonomic risk factors may cause selected other musculoskeletal diseases, other than back or neck pain (MSD) or osteoarthritis of hip or knee (OA). In this paper, we present a systematic review and meta-analysis of parameters for estimating the number of disability-adjusted life years from MSD or OA that are attributable to occupational exposure to ergonomic risk factors, for the development of the WHO/ILO Joint Estimates. OBJECTIVES We aimed to systematically review and meta-analyse estimates of the effect of occupational exposure to ergonomic risk factors (force exertion, demanding posture, repetitiveness, hand-arm vibration, lifting, kneeling and/or squatting, and climbing) on MSD and OA (two outcomes: prevalence and incidence). DATA SOURCES We developed and published a protocol, applying the Navigation Guide as an organizing systematic review framework where feasible. We searched electronic academic databases for potentially relevant records from published and unpublished studies, including the International Trials Register, Ovid Medline, EMBASE, and CISDOC. We also searched electronic grey literature databases, Internet search engines and organizational websites; hand-searched reference list of previous systematic reviews and included study records; and consulted additional experts. STUDY ELIGIBILITY AND CRITERIA We included working-age (≥15 years) workers in the formal and informal economy in any WHO and/or ILO Member State but excluded children (<15 years) and unpaid domestic workers. We included randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, case-control studies and other non-randomized intervention studies with an estimate of the effect of occupational exposure to ergonomic risk factors (any exposure to force exertion, demanding posture, repetitiveness, hand-arm vibration, lifting, kneeling and/or squatting, and climbing ≥ 2 h/day) compared with no or low exposure to the theoretical minimum risk exposure level (<2 h/day) on the prevalence or incidence of MSD or OA. STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS At least two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts against the eligibility criteria at a first stage and full texts of potentially eligible records at a second stage, followed by extraction of data from qualifying studies. Missing data were requested from principal study authors. We combined odds ratios using random-effect meta-analysis. Two or more review authors assessed the risk of bias and the quality of evidence, using Navigation Guide tools adapted to this project. RESULTS In total eight studies (4 cohort studies and 4 case control studies) met the inclusion criteria, comprising a total of 2,378,729 participants (1,157,943 females and 1,220,786 males) in 6 countries in 3 WHO regions (Europe, Eastern Mediterranean and Western Pacific). The exposure was measured using self-reports in most studies and with a job exposure matrix in one study and outcome was generally assessed with physician diagnostic records or administrative health data. Across included studies, risk of bias was generally moderate. Compared with no or low exposure (<2 h per day), any occupational exposure to ergonomic risk factors increased the risk of acquiring MSD (odds ratio (OR) 1.76, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.14 to 2.72, 4 studies, 2,376,592 participants, I2 70%); and increased the risk of acquiring OA of knee or hip (OR 2.20, 95% CI 1.42 to 3.40, 3 studies, 1,354 participants, I2 13%); Subgroup analysis for MSD found evidence for differences by sex, but indicated a difference in study type, where OR was higher among study participants in a case control study compared to study participants in cohort studies. CONCLUSIONS Overall, for both outcomes, the main body of evidence was assessed as being of low quality. Occupational exposure to ergonomic risk factors increased the risk of acquiring MSD and of acquiring OA of knee or hip. We judged the body of human evidence on the relationship between exposure to occupational ergonomic factors and MSD as ""limited evidence of harmfulness"" and the relationship between exposure to occupational ergonomic factors and OA also as ""limited evidence of harmfulness"". These relative risks might perhaps be suitable as input data for WHO/ILO modelling of work-related burden of disease and injury.

One side recognizes the microbial antigen, and the other gives a call to arms to fight infection by recruiting immune cells and triggering inflammation. A balanced immune response must combine a potent neutralizing antibody and a swift disposal of the invading agent by innate immune cells with the least tissue damage possible. The longer the immune system takes to control the infection, the higher the possibility for a self-sustaining inflammatory process with potentially fatal consequences for the host. In addition to quantity, the quality of antibodies also matters, because posttranslational modifications altering the N-glycan composition in Fc fractions may help tilt the balance to the effector side, by modifying their affinity for Fc receptors in immune cells. The COVID-19 pandemic has provided a wealth of data bolstering our understanding of the rules governing the production of protective and nonprotective antibodies. Also, it has broadened our understanding of the role of viruses in triggering autoimmunity and inflammation, and widened our knowledge of the different mechanisms that can be activated by viral infection and lead to autoantibody production, inflammation, and progressive tissue damage. In addition, the COVID-19 infection has contributed a great deal to our comprehension of the role of antibodies in the causation of cytokine storms and systemic inflammatory response syndrome, also seen in patients with systemic autoimmune diseases.","Rodriguez, Martin A; Fuentes-Silva, Yurilis J; Vásquez, Gloria",Journal of clinical rheumatology : practical reports on rheumatic & musculoskeletal diseases,99,1

This study aimed to compare the efficacy of the non-invasive cooling device Hilotherm Clinic (Hilotherm GmbH, Germany) with conventional cooling to induce and maintain mild hypothermia in patients after out-of-hospital CA. METHODS 50 adult patients with an indication for controlled mild hypothermia were prospectively assigned to conventional cooling (n=20) or cooling with the Hilotherm system (n=30). Patients receiving a cooling therapy by Hilotherm were treated either with 0.35 m(2) (n=20) or with 0.7 m(2) (n=10) surface area of cooling sleeves. RESULTS The speed of cooling was significantly higher in both Hilotherm groups compared to conventional cooling (Hilotherm 0.7 m(2): 0.91 ± 0.08°C/h, Hilotherm 0.35 m(2): 0.47 ± 0.04°C/h, and conventional: 0.3 ± 0.04°C/h, p ≤ 0.003). Temperature deviation from the target temperature of 33°C was significantly higher in the conventional group compared to both Hilotherm groups. During induction of mild hypothermia a significant reduction of the mean arterial blood pressure and the heart rate was observed without significant differences between the groups. However, the speed of cooling (range 0.3-0.91°C/h) did not correlate to the decrease of blood pressure and heart rate. Norepinephrine dosing during induction of mild hypothermia and re-warming (1st-2nd day) was significantly increased compared to the 3rd day after admission in all groups. Dobutamine dosing and 30 days in-hospital mortality did not differ significantly between the groups. CONCLUSIONS Rapid and reliable mild hypothermia can be better achieved by the non-invasive cooling system Hilotherm compared to conventional cooling with ice packs and cold infusion.","Rana, Majeed; W Schröder, Jörg; Saygili, Erol; Hameed, Umer; Benke, Dirk; Hoffmann, Rainer; Schauerte, Patrick; Marx, Nikolaus; Rana, Obaida R",International journal of cardiology,99,1

Individualized blood glucose target goals and treatment strategies should be made according to specific circumstances of COVID-19 inpatients with diabetes. For mild patients, a strict glycemic control target (fasting plasma glucose (FPG) 4.4-6.1 mmol/L, 2-hour postprandial plasma glucose (2 h PG) 6.1-7.8 mmol/L) are recommended; a target for the glycemic control of common type patients (FPG 6.1-7.8 mmol/L, 2 h PG 7.8-10.0 mmol/L) and subcutaneous insulin deliver therapy are recommended; a target nonfasting blood glucose range of 10.0 mmol or less per liter for severe-type COVID-19 patients, a relatively Less stringent blood glucose control target (FPG 7.8-10.0 mmol/L, 2 h PG 7.8-13.9 mmol/L) for critically ill patients and intravenous insulin infusion therapy are recommended. Due to the rapid changes in the condition of some patients, the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or hyperglycemic hyperosmolar status (HHS) maybe occur during the treatment. Blood glucose monitoring, dynamic evaluation and timely adjustment of strategies should be strengthened to ensure patient safety and promote early recovery of patients.","Ma, Wan-Xia; Ran, Xing-Wu",Sichuan da xue xue bao.

A proposed explanation for this increased risk, are procoagulant tumour-derived substances, such as tissue factor, usually measured in peripheral blood. The aim of the present study is to investigate whether a rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) can measure the procoagulative activity of tumour tissue. The study included 21 patients who were undergoing a craniotomy and complete tumour resection after written consent and ethical approval were obtained. Tumour tissue was biopsied during surgery and used for in vitro spiking of patients own citrated whole blood. Blood samples with or without spiking were analyzed with ROTEM using different activating reagents. ROTEM clotting time significantly decreased (p < .001), indicating a hypercoagulative response on clot initiation that was strongest for glioma tumours. However, ROTEM clot formation time was significantly prolonged (p < .001), which was an opposite response that indicated poor initial clot propagation. ROTEM maximum lysis was increased in the tumour tissue-spiked samples (p < .001), indicating a strong fibrinolytic activity in brain tumour tissue. Tissue extracts from intracranial tumours have both procoagulant and fibrinolytic effects that are detectable with ROTEM. Glioma tumours had the strongest hypercoagulative response in our in vitro model. Larger studies are necessary to test the clinical relevance and accuracy of tumour extract spiked viscoelastic tests to predict the individual patient risk for developing a thrombotic complication.","Jansohn, Erik; Bengzon, Johan; Kander, Thomas; Schött, Ulf",Scandinavian journal of clinical and laboratory investigation,99,31

In this study, we vaccinated one-day old broiler chicks by eyedrop with three or four different IBV vaccine types simultaneously. The presence and relative amount of each vaccine was examined in all of the birds by IBV type specific real time RT-PCR at 5 days post-vaccination and each vaccine was detected in all of the birds given that vaccine. The birds were challenged at 28-days of age and protection was measured by clinical signs, virus detection and by ciliostasis. Birds vaccinated with 3 different IBV types (Ark, Mass and GA98) were protected against challenge with each of those IBV types and were partially protected against challenge with the GA08 virus. Birds vaccinated with 4 different IBV types (Ark, Mass, GA98 and GA08) were protected against challenge with each of those IBV types with the exception of Mass challenged birds which clearly had 3/11 birds not protected based on individual ciliostasis scores, but had an average ciliostasis score of >50% which is considered protected. The results are important for the control of IBV because they indicate that simultaneous vaccination with up to 4 different IBV vaccine types can provide adequate protection against challenge for each type.","Jackwood, Mark W; Clark, Randi; Cheng, Sunny; Jordan, Brian J",Avian pathology : journal of the W.V.P.A,99,16

MATERIALS AND METHODS Using the free-text string ""intus,"" the radiology information database of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center was searched over a 13.5-year period for abdominopelvic CT scan reports. Images were rereviewed by an attending radiologist for the presence of a bowel-within-bowel appearance involving the colon. The reference standard for a lead point was histopathologic examination or, if the tumor was not resected, an identifiable mass persisting on follow-up CT scans. Transient intussusception was defined as intussusception that resolved on follow-up CT scan without surgical removal or as intussusception with an intermittent presence on serial CT scans. Idiopathic intussusception was defined as the absence of mass or mural thickening at CT or surgery. RESULTS Four hundred sixty-one CT scan reports were retrieved, 138 of which mentioned intussusception as a pertinent negative. From the remaining 323 scan reports, after all exclusions (small bowel-small bowel intussusception, incomplete imaging, pediatric patients, and misinterpretations on rereview), 33 patients were shown to have 34 intussusceptions, including ileocolic (n = 11) and colocolic (n = 23) intussusceptions, on 34 CT scans. Seven intussusceptions were transient (i.e., intermittent). No patient had idiopathic intussusception. Histopathologic results were available for 22 of 34 intussusceptions. Intussusceptions were caused by colorectal cancer (n = 12), lymphoma (n = 5), metastases to the colon (n = 8), colon polyps (n = 4), and nonneoplastic causes, including lipoma (n = 3), hematoma (n = 1), and edema (n = 1). CONCLUSION In patients with cancer, intussusceptions involving the colon are never idiopathic. Most are due to primary colon cancer or metastatic disease and most require surgical removal. Although seven intussusceptions were transient, six were caused by neoplasia.","Gollub, Marc J",AJR. American journal of roentgenology,99,12

Discrimination based on race, ethnicity, gender, and sexual orientation commonly confers cumulative and chronic effects. In the field of traumatic stress studies, several types of identity-linked traumatic events have been identified and empirically investigated as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)-producing experiences. Collectively, the 13 papers included in this special issue raise questions about the definition, conceptualization, and categorization of various forms of explicit and implicit identity-linked trauma. These papers highlight the need for acceptance of a shared nomenclature and better differentiation of both causal and correlational associations with acute and chronic PTSD, depression, suicide risk, alcohol misuse, and other mental health outcomes. In this commentary, the discussion is extended to COVID-19, a disease that has been globally devastating for many. On multiple levels (i.e., physical, mental, emotional, economic, and social), COVID-19 has magnified the prepandemic fault lines of race, ethnicity, gender, gender identity, and sexual orientation. Applying a syndemic framework to the health impact of COVID-19 and, arguably, the most pervasive identity linked epidemic worldwide-systemic racism-brings perspective to the biological and social forces that are likely to be driving the convergence of COVID-19, systemic racism, and chronic health inequities, and may be informative in guiding evidence-based strategies for managing racial trauma in the context of COVID-19.","Seedat, Soraya",Journal of traumatic stress,99,17

There have been many studies illustrating the positive effects of a ketogenic diet in weight loss and other benefits; however, the long-term effects and potential adverse events of a ketogenic diet have not been well studied or documented in literature. There are a few case reports of ketogenic diet resulting in hypoglycemia. We report a case of hypoglycemia with a blood glucose of 39 mg/dL and ketosis in a 69-year-old woman who strictly followed a ketogenic diet for nearly one year. She presented with malaise, sugar cravings, and mental fogginess, and after intake of alcoholic beverages, was admitted to the hospital with hypoglycemia. She had elevated beta-hydroxybutyrate, and low insulin and C-peptide, all consistent with a starvation ketosis. This case illustrates that adherence to a ketogenic diet for a prolonged period of time, in combination with alcohol intake, can disrupt normal glucose homeostatic mechanisms and result in a significant degree of hypoglycemia. This pattern of hypoglycemia may not present with classic symptoms, most likely partly due to effects of the ketogenic diet on brain function. This case provides insight that supports the need to counsel patients about alcohol intake while on the ketogenic diet. More information is needed on long-term complications of the ketogenic diet on glucose homeostasis in the body as well as in the brain.","Spoke, Christopher; Malaeb, Samar",Journal of the Endocrine Society,99,16

Precise analysis of complex neural circuits requires high-density integration of multiple cellular-size light sources and recording electrodes. However, high-density integration inevitably introduces stimulation artifact. We present minimal-stimulation-artifact (miniSTAR) μLED optoelectrodes that enable effective elimination of stimulation artifact. A multi-metal-layer structure with a shielding layer effectively suppresses capacitive coupling of stimulation signals. A heavily boron-doped silicon substrate silences the photovoltaic effect induced from LED illumination. With transient stimulation pulse shaping, we reduced stimulation artifact on miniSTAR μLED optoelectrodes to below 50 μVpp, much smaller than a typical spike detection threshold, at optical stimulation of >50 mW mm-2 irradiance. We demonstrated high-temporal resolution (<1 ms) opto-electrophysiology without any artifact-induced signal quality degradation during in vivo experiments. MiniSTAR μLED optoelectrodes will facilitate functional mapping of local circuits and discoveries in the brain.","Kim, Kanghwan; Vöröslakos, Mihály; Seymour, John P; Wise, Kensall D; Buzsáki, György; Yoon, Euisik",Nature communications,99,30

Also, this paper analyses the relationship between any two SNPs via linkage disequilibrium analysis, and visualises the patterns of cumulative mutations of SNPs over collection time. The results are in three folds. First, the SNP which locates at the nucleotide position 4321 is found to be an independent significant locus associated with all the first three phenotypes. Moreover, 12 significant SNPs are found in the first two studies. Second, gene orf1ab containing SNP-4321 is detected to be significantly associated with the first three phenotypes, and the three genes, S, ORF3a, and N, are detected significant in the first two phenotypes. Third, some of the detected genes or SNPs are related to the SARS-COV-2 as supported by literature survey, which indicates that the results here may be helpful for further investigation.","Lv, Jinxiong; Tu, Shikui; Xu, Lei",IEEE/ACM transactions on computational biology and bioinformatics,99,20

METHODS A new classification and standardized imaging diagnosis report mode of viral pneumonia was established by studying and summarizing the imaging findings of various kinds of viral pneumonia, combining with lesion density, interstitial changes, pleural effusion, lymph nodes, and some special signs. After systematic training, the radiologist experienced clinical practice for screening CT features. COVID-19 cases were screened retrospectively in the single-center. The confirmed cases were verified, and the diagnostic efficacy of the standardized imaging reporting system in screening COVID-19 was tested. RESULTS There were 912 patients in this stage receiving the screening imaging examination. Of them, 190 patients were screened in the report mode and 30 patients were diagnosed as COVID-19. The CT manifestation of COVID-19 was characterized by pure ground glass lesions or with a few solid components, predominant subpleural distribution, no lymph node enlargement and pleural effusion, and often with paving-way sign and air bronchus sign. In combination with the above signs, the diagnostic efficacy of COVID-19 was 0.942. CONCLUSIONS The standardized imaging diagnosis report mode based on COVID-19 chest image features is effective and practical, which should be popularized.","Wang, Tianming; Xiong, Zeng; Zhou, Hui; Luo, Weijun; Tang, Haixiong; Liu, Jinkang",Zhong nan da xue xue bao.

METHODS A retrospective review of a prospectively maintained endovascular database identified six patients who underwent EVD placement using iGuide. Patient characteristics, operator, number of passes, accuracy of placement, immediate and delayed periprocedural complications and radiation exposure were assessed. RESULTS Five patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage and one patient with a large cerebellar infarct (average age 45.5 years (range 39-53), four women) underwent EVD placement within the angiography suite using iGuide. Four procedures were performed by a neuroradiologist and two by a neurosurgeon. All catheters were placed with a single pass and all terminated within the frontal horn of the ipsilateral lateral ventricle. No parenchymal or intraventricular hemorrhages were encountered after catheter placement. No patients experienced any immediate or delayed periprocedural complications. Radiation exposure related to the FD CTs required for placement was 593.7 mGy (range 539-673). CONCLUSIONS EVD placement under combined CT and fluoroscopic control within the neuroangiography suite is feasible. The technique predictably allows optimized EVD catheter placement with a single pass. We propose that this technique could improve the accuracy, and potentially reduce the complications, of EVD insertion in cerebrovascular patients.","Fiorella, David; Peeling, Lissa; Denice, Christine M; Sarmiento, Marily; Woo, Henry H",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,99,14

However, a recent study found that the Rhadinorhynchidae is paraphyletic, due to the basal position of Rhadinorhynchus biformis Smales, 2014 relative to the Rhadinorhynchidae + Transvenidae. We reassess these relationships with new single-gene and concatenated phylogenetic analyses utilising cox1 mtDNA, 18S rDNA and 28S rDNA, including recently available sequences. Although topologies differed among single-gene analyses, the overall results support R. biformis as representative of a lineage distinct from those of the Rhadinorhynchidae and Transvenidae. Examination of additional specimens of R. biformis allowed us to identify morphological characters that further support this hypothesis. These results lead us to propose transfer of R. biformis to a new genus (Spinulacorpus n. g.) and family (Spinulacorpidae n. fam.) to resolve the paraphyly of the Rhadinorhynchidae.","Huston, Daniel C; Smales, Lesley R",Systematic parasitology,99,17

This study was performed to evaluate the feasibility of NOTES transanal rectosigmoidectomy using a single port in a swine model. METHODS Ten male pigs were used to conduct 2 studies, 4 for a nonsurvival study and 6 for a survival study. After anesthesia, the rectum was occluded transanally with a purse-string suture, and then a single port was placed. CO(2) gas was insufflated, and full-thickness rectal dissection was extended using laparoscopic instruments as far cephalad as possible. A 5-mm trocar was placed on the abdominal wall for transabdominal laparoscopic view, and then further colonic mobilization was performed using the endoscope through the anus. When the dissection was completed, the specimen was exteriorized and colorectal anastomosis was performed using a circular stapler. In the survival study, necropsies were performed on postoperative day 7. RESULTS Full-thickness circumferential rectosigmoid mobilization was achieved in all cases. The mean length of resected colon was 10 cm (range = 8-15 cm). No anastomotic defects were noted. All resected rectosigmoid specimens were grossly intact. No mortality or significant postoperative complications was observed in the survival group. On necropsy, a small abscess in the pelvic cavity was noted in 1 case and bladder distention was noted in 3 cases. CONCLUSIONS NOTES transanal rectosigmoidectomy using the single port is feasible and safe. Further experimental studies are warranted, especially in human cadaver model.","Kim, Taehyung; Sohn, Dae Kyung; Park, Ji Won; Park, Chan-Ho; Moon, Sang Hui; Chang, Hee Jin; Kang, Sung-Bum; Oh, Jae Hwan",Surgical innovation,99,1

Patients had a mean age of 63.3±16.2 years (range, 26-92). The admission National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was 19.5±4.3 (median 20). Mean time from symptom onset to femoral artery puncture was 3.8±1.1 hours (median 4 hours). Mean time to recanalization was 46.9±11.1 minutes. Successful recanalization by means of stent-based thrombectomy alone was achieved in 90% of cases and reached 100% after combining definitive stent implantation in three patients. There was no arterial rupture or subarachnoid hemorrhage. Hemorrhagic transformation developed in seven patients (23%), but was symptomatic in only one.

Particularly, the role of these microvesicles has been explored in metastasis, which represents the leading cause of breast cancer morbidity and mortality worldwide. Reports highlight that the plasticity of breast cancer cells, fundamental for the establishment of distant metastasis, may be in part attributed to exosome-carried signals shared between adjacent cells and long-distance cells in the body.

This persistence is due, at least in part, to the presence of antivaccine movements, the diversity of the surveillance systems, and the lack of a uniform case definition for the region. Given the importance of whooping cough in Latin America and the changes in vaccine recommendations, this manuscript aims to review epidemiologic data and recent changes in the vaccination calendars and their impact on the pediatric disease by Bordetella pertussis in Latin America. Recent epidemiological data reveal that between regions, countries, and administrative units within each country there is a marked heterogeneity of vaccine coverage, with different outbreak patterns. Efforts in the region have tried to improve this situation by introducing acellular pertussis vaccines (aP) in the vaccine calendars, which are less reactogenic than whole-cell pertussis vaccines (wP). Moreover, some countries have improved the case definition. Some countries have implemented a confirmed case definition by introducing polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as a diagnostic criterion. As a response to the heterogeneities observed within and between countries and the regional epidemiologic profiles, a Steering Committee from the Latin American Society for Pediatric Infectiology (SLIPE) and the Latin American Association of Pediatrics (ALAPE) propose a unified case definition and recommendations to improve vaccine coverage and reduce the outbreaks of whooping cough in Latin America.","Gentile, Ángela; Torres-Torreti, Juan Pablo; López-López, Pío; Ulloa-Gutierrez, Rolando",Revista chilena de infectologia : organo oficial de la Sociedad Chilena de Infectologia,99,12

However, the specific regulatory mechanism in AD remains unclear. METHODS Firstly, AD model was generated by the intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of the Aβ1-42 peptide. Subsequently, mice were injected with shRNA adenoviral transduction particles designed to target DJ-1 or Aβ1-42 or Aβ1-42+shNC or Aβ1-42+shRNA against DJ-1. shRNA against DJ-1 were injected into hippocampus of mice (8×104 viral particles for each mice) for 7 consecutive days. Immunohistochemistry was performed to detect the accumulation of Aβ in the hippocampus of mice, and HE staining assay was carried to detect pathological changes in the hippocampus of mice. Further, sh-IKKβ, shDJ-1, pcDNA-IKKβ and pcDNA-DJ-1 plasmids were transfected into HT-22 cells, MTT assay, TUNEL staining and Hoechst staining were performed to detect cell viability and apoptosis, respectively. Western blotting was carried to measure the relative proteins expression. RESULTS Findings indicated that Aβ1-42 inhibited autophagy and up-regulated p-Tau protein expression; the overexpression of IKKβ and DJ-1 all rescued the autophagy inhibited by Aβ1-42 and down-regulated p-Tau protein expression induced by Aβ1-42; DJ-1 up-regulated IKKβ via p-VHL, further promoted autophagy and reduced the expression of p-Tau protein; DJ-1 knockdown inhibited autophagy and up-regulated p-Tau protein expression, resulting in delayed behavior in mice. CONCLUSION In conclusion, IKKβ, modulated by DJ-1p-VHL, reduces p-Tau accumulation via autophagy in AD's disease model. This study may provide theoretical basis for the treatment of AD.","Chen, Wei-Ping; Zhang, Ge; Cheng, Zhi-Juan; Gu, Xun-Hu; Li, Min; Liu, Xu",Neuroscience,99,1

Late clinical presentation has meant that human CMV (HCMV) dissemination is not well understood. Murine CMV (MCMV) provides a tractable model. Whole mouse imaging of virus-expressed luciferase has proved a useful way to track systemic infections. MCMV, in which the abundant lytic gene M78 was luciferase-tagged via a self-cleaving peptide (M78-LUC), allowed serial, unbiased imaging of systemic and peripheral infection without significant virus attenuation. Ex vivo luciferase imaging showed greater sensitivity than plaque assay, and revealed both well-known infection sites (the lungs, lymph nodes, salivary glands, liver, spleen and pancreas) and less explored sites (the bone marrow and upper respiratory tract). We applied luciferase imaging to tracking MCMV lacking M33, a chemokine receptor conserved in HCMV and a proposed anti-viral drug target. M33-deficient M78-LUC colonized normally in peripheral sites and local draining lymph nodes but spread poorly to the salivary gland, suggesting a defect in vascular transport consistent with properties of a chemokine receptor.","Farrell, Helen; Oliveira, Martha; Macdonald, Kate; Yunis, Joseph; Mach, Michael; Bruce, Kimberley; Stevenson, Philip; Cardin, Rhonda; Davis-Poynter, Nicholas",The Journal of general virology,99,1

During the formation of the Global Fund, necessary anti-corruption, transparency, and accountability (ACTA) structures were not put in place to prevent fraud and corruption in its grants, which resulted in the misuse of funds by grant recipients and an eventual loss of donor confidence in 2011. The Global Fund has instituted various ACTA mechanisms to address this misuse of funding and the subsequent loss of donor confidence, and this paper seeks to understand these implementations and their impacts over the past decade, in an effort to probe ACTA more deeply. RESULTS By restructuring the governing committees in 2011, and the Audit and Finance; Ethics and Governance; and Strategy Committees in 2016, the Global Fund has delineated committee mandates and strengthened the Board's oversight of operations. Additionally, the Global Fund has adopted a rigorous risk management framework which it has worked into all aspects of its functioning. An Ethics and Integrity Framework was adopted in 2014 and an Ethics Office was established in 2016, resulting in increased conflict of interest disclosures and greater considerations of ethics within the organization. The Global Fund's Office of the Inspector General (OIG) has effectively performed internal and external audits and investigations on fraud and corruption, highlighted potential risks for mitigation, and has implemented ACTA initiatives, such as the I Speak Out Now! campaign to encourage whistleblowing and educate on fraud and corruption. CONCLUSIONS From 2011 onwards, the Global Fund has developed a number of ACTA mechanisms which, in particular, resulted in reduced grant-related risks and procurement fraud as demonstrated by the decreased classification from high to moderate in 2017, and the reduction of investigations in 2018 respectively. However, it is crucial that the Global Fund continues to evaluate the effectiveness of these mechanisms; monitor for potential perverse impacts; and make necessary changes, when and where they are needed.","Chang, Zhihao; Rusu, Violet; Kohler, Jillian C",Globalization and health,99,14

However, these have had adverse effects, including delayed aneurysm occlusion, posttreatment symptoms, and rupture. The hemodynamic profiles of aneurysms treated with flow diverters were analyzed to determine the ones associated with successful and failed treatments. MATERIALS AND METHODS Patient-specific computational fluid dynamics were used to simulate hemodynamic profiles, including the presence of jet flow, energy loss, volume flow, and wall shear stress in 4 successful occlusions of aneurysms and 4 failed cases after flow-diverter deployment. In these 4 failed cases, hemodynamic profiles were examined again after a hypothetic second intervention. This involved replacing the failed flow diverter with a hypothetic optimally deployed flow diverter or simulated placement of a second flow diverter within the first (double hypothetic optimally deployed). RESULTS Where successful occlusions were achieved, a marked obliteration of jet flow was observed. Flow entering the aneurysm sac was diverted via the center of the flow diverter and joined smoothly with the continuation of flow leaving the aneurysm sac into the parent arteries. These observations were supplemented by a reduction in the other hemodynamic profiles. Aneurysm neck geometry might influence the efficacy of the flow diverter. CONCLUSIONS Hemodynamic indices, as calculated by using computational fluid dynamics techniques, have close correlation with flow-diverter treatment outcome. Computational fluid dynamics could be potentially useful as a planning tool for neurointerventionists by simulating an optimized flow-diverter deployment strategy before the procedure and evaluating posttreatment outcome.","Chong, W; Zhang, Y; Qian, Y; Lai, L; Parker, G; Mitchell, K",AJNR.

However, manual measurement of CIV is time-consuming and operator-dependent. The purpose of this study was to develop and evaluate a robust automated measurement of the CIV. MATERIALS AND METHODS The CIV in early follow-up CT images of 34 consecutive patients with acute ischemic stroke was segmented with an automated intensity-based region-growing algorithm, which includes partial volume effect correction near the skull, midline determination, and ventricle and hemorrhage exclusion. Two observers manually delineated the CIV. Interobserver variability of the manual assessments and the accuracy of the automated method were evaluated by using the Pearson correlation, Bland-Altman analysis, and Dice coefficients. The accuracy was defined as the correlation with the manual assessment as a reference standard. RESULTS The Pearson correlation for the automated method compared with the reference standard was similar to the manual correlation (R = 0.98). The accuracy of the automated method was excellent with a mean difference of 0.5 mL with limits of agreement of -38.0-39.1 mL, which were more consistent than the interobserver variability of the 2 observers (-40.9-44.1 mL). However, the Dice coefficients were higher for the manual delineation. CONCLUSIONS The automated method showed a strong correlation and accuracy with the manual reference measurement. This approach has the potential to become the standard in assessing the infarct volume as a secondary outcome measure for evaluating the effectiveness of treatment.","Boers, A M; Marquering, H A; Jochem, J J; Besselink, N J; Berkhemer, O A; van der Lugt, A; Beenen, L F; Majoie, C B",AJNR.

Recent evidence suggests an ideal inhibition range of 70-150 P2Y12 response units (PRU) as measured on the VerifyNow assay, which relies on photometric measurements of platelet aggregation. Thromboelastography (TEG) with platelet mapping (PM) is an alternative assay that directly measures clot formation and mechanical strength. This study compares the results of PRU to TEG-PM.METHODSPatients with simultaneous or near-simultaneous PRU and TEG-PM results who underwent cervical carotid artery stenting, intracranial stent-assisted aneurysm coiling, or flow diversion at the authors' institution between August 2015 and November 2016 were identified. PRU results were compared with the TEG maximal amplitude (MA) attributable to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) activity (MA-ADP) as measured by TEG-PM. Platelet inhibition was considered therapeutic for MA-ADP values < 50 mm or PRU < 194. The Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated, and the sensitivity and specificity of PRU were calculated assuming that the results of TEG-PM reflected the true degree of platelet inhibition.RESULTSTwenty-three patients were identified with a total of 37 matched sets of TEG-PM and PRU. Three of these pairs were excluded due to anemia outside of the PRU manufacturer's recommended range. The Pearson correlation coefficient for these values was 0.50 (p = 0.0026). The prevalence of clopidogrel nonresponders determined by TEG-PM (9%) matched reported rates (5%-12%); PRU demonstrated much higher prevalence (39%). For detecting a therapeutic level of platelet inhibition, PRU demonstrated a sensitivity of 0.59, specificity of 0.50, positive predictive value of 0.95, and negative predictive value of 0.07. Ideal inhibition was concordant in only 25% of observations in which at least one of the results was ideal.CONCLUSIONSAgreement between TEG-PM and PRU regarding the degree of platelet inhibition is poor. PRU likely overestimates clopidogrel resistance, as 93% of patients with PRU > 194 demonstrate a therapeutic level of platelet inhibition on TEG.","Corliss, Brian M; Polifka, Adam J; Harris, Neil S; Hoh, Brian L; Fox, W Christopher",Journal of neurosurgery,99,1

However, the existing models independently process the 3D lesion segmentation and disease classification, ignoring the inherent correlation between these two tasks. In this paper, we propose a joint deep learning model of 3D lesion segmentation and classification for diagnosing COVID-19, called DeepSC-COVID, as the first attempt in this direction. Specifically, we establish a large-scale CT database containing 1,805 3D CT scans with fine-grained lesion annotations, and reveal 4 findings about lesion difference between COVID-19 and community acquired pneumonia (CAP). Inspired by our findings, DeepSC-COVID is designed with 3 subnets: a cross-task feature subnet for feature extraction, a 3D lesion subnet for lesion segmentation, and a classification subnet for disease diagnosis. Besides, the task-aware loss is proposed for learning the task interaction across the 3D lesion and classification subnets. Different from all existing models for COVID-19 diagnosis, our model is interpretable with fine-grained 3D lesion distribution. Finally, extensive experimental results show that the joint learning framework in our model significantly improves the performance of 3D lesion segmentation and disease classification in both efficiency and efficacy.","Wang, Xiaofei; Jiang, Lai; Li, Liu; Xu, Mai; Deng, Xin; Dai, Lisong; Xu, Xiangyang; Li, Tianyi; Guo, Yichen; Wang, Zulin; Dragotti, Pier Luigi",IEEE transactions on medical imaging,99,31

Analysis of Google Trend information may give providers and healthcare systems useful information regarding Internet users' interest in bariatric procedures. The objective of this study was to gather Google Trend information on worldwide Internet searches for ""bariatric surgery"", ""gastric bypass"", ""gastric sleeve"", ""gastric plication"", and ""lap band"" from 2004-2012 and to explore temporal relationships with relevant media events, economic variations, and policy modifications. METHODS Data were collected using Google Trends. Trend analyses were performed using Microsoft Excel Version 14.3.5 and Minitab V.16.0. RESULTS Trend analyses showed that total search volume for the term ""bariatric surgery"" has declined roughly 25% since January 2004, although interest increased approximately 5% from 2011 to 2012. Interest in lap band procedures declined 30% over the past 5 years, while ""gastric sleeve"" has increased 15%. Spikes in search numbers show an association with events such as changing policy and insurance guidelines and media coverage for bariatric procedures. CONCLUSION This report illustrates that variations in Internet search volume for terms related to bariatric surgery are multifactorial in origin. Although it is impossible to ascertain if reported Internet search volume is based on interest in potentially undergoing bariatric surgery or simply general interest, this analysis reveals that search volume appears to mirror real world events. Therefore, Google Trends could be a way to supplement understanding about interest in bariatric procedures.","Linkov, Faina; Bovbjerg, Dana H; Freese, Kyle E; Ramanathan, Ramesh; Eid, George Michel; Gourash, William",Surgery for obesity and related diseases : official journal of the American Society for Bariatric Surgery,99,1

After that, batteries are considered inappropriate for traction services but they still have 80% of its original capacity. On the other hand, energy storage devices will have an important role in the electricity market. Being Li-ion batteries still too expensive to provide such services with economic profit, the idea to reuse affordable electric vehicle batteries for a 2nd life originated the Sunbatt project, connecting the automotive and electricity sectors. The battery reuse is, by itself, a path towards sustainability, but the cleanliness of energy storage also depends on the electricity generation power sources and the battery ageing or lifespan. This paper analyses the rest of useful life of 2nd life batteries on four different stationary applications, which are: Support to fast electric vehicle charges, self-consumption, area regulation and transmission deferral. To do so, it takes advantage of an equivalent electric battery-ageing model that simulates the battery capacity fade through its use. This model runs on Matlab and includes several ageing mechanisms, such as calendar ageing, C-rate, Depth-of-Discharge, temperature and voltage. Results show that 2nd life battery lifespan clearly depends on its use, going from about 30 years in fast electric vehicle charge support applications to around 6 years in area regulation grid services. Additionally, this study analyses the day-to-day emissions from electricity generation in Spain, and states that grid oriented energy storage applications will hardly offer environmental benefits in the nearby future. On the other hand, applications that go by the hand of renewable power sources, such as self-consumption applications, are much more appropriate.","Casals, Lluc Canals; Amante García, B; Canal, Camille",Journal of environmental management,99,1

METHODS The authors retrospectively analyzed 101 patients who underwent DP with a triple-row stapler to identify the clinicopathological factors that strongly influence POPF after DP. The height difference (HD) was defined as the difference between the pancreatic thickness and the height of the closed stapler. RESULTS POPF occurred in 58 (57%) patients. A multivariate analysis identified HD and pancreatic thickness as independent risk factors for the occurrence of POPF after DP. Akaike's information criterion for identifying the risk factors was more favorable for HD (115.18) than for pancreatic thickness (118.02). The incidence of POPF was significantly lower (29%) in patients with an HD between 6 and 12 mm than in the other two groups (< 6-mm group: 100%, P = 0.008; ≥ 12-mm group: 84%, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS A too-thick or too-narrow pancreas carries a risk of developing POPF after DP when using a triple-row stapler. Selecting staplers to achieve an HD of 6-12 mm may reduce the incidence of POPF following DP.","Nishikawa, Makoto; Yamamoto, Junji; Hoshikawa, Mayumi; Einama, Takahiro; Noro, Takuji; Aosasa, Suefumi; Tsujimoto, Hironori; Ueno, Hideki; Kishi, Yoji",Surgery today,99,1

DATA SOURCES We performed a literature search of the electronic databases CINAHL Plus, EMBASE, MEDLINE (Ovid) and Web of Science from database inception to May 2021 as well as hand searching of trial registries and reference lists of related reviews. STUDY SELECTION Two reviewers identified whether RCTs met the following inclusion criteria: adult population to whom antibiotics were administered; a probiotic intervention; a placebo, alternative dose, alternative probiotic strain or no treatment control; and incidence of AAD as the outcome. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Two reviewers independently collected data and assessed risk of bias using preconstructed data extraction forms. We used a random effects model for all analyses. Subgroup analyses were performed to evaluate species-specific and dose-specific response. RESULTS Forty-two studies (11,305 participants) were included in this review. The pooled analysis suggests that co-administration of probiotics with antibiotics reduces the risk of AAD in adults by 37% (risk ratio (RR)=0.63 (95% CI 0.54 to 0.73), p<0.00001). The overall quality of the evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) criteria was found to be moderate. In subgroup analyses, high dose compared with low dose of the same probiotic demonstrated a positive protective effect (RR 0.54 (95% CI 0.38 to 0.76), p<0.01), and only certain species, mainly of the lactobacillus and bifidobacteria genera, were found to be effective. Studies with a low baseline AAD risk did not show any difference in risk but studies with moderate or high baseline AAD risk demonstrated a significant risk reduction. CONCLUSIONS Probiotics are effective for preventing AAD. Secondary analyses of higher dosages and certain species have shown increased effectiveness. Our results may not be applicable in clinical scenarios of lower baseline AAD risk.","Goodman, Clare; Keating, Georgia; Georgousopoulou, Ekavi; Hespe, Charlotte; Levett, Kate",BMJ open,99,26

For decades, suture-based thoracic aortic constriction has been the preferred method for increasing left ventricular (LV) afterload in rodents, but the degree of stenosis resulting from this method is variable. In an effort to improve this methodology, we subjected mice to constriction of the ascending aorta using o-rings with fixed inner diameters (IDs). Methods and results Mice of C57BL/6J and FVB/N background were subjected to constriction of the ascending aorta using o-rings with fixed IDs of 0.71, 0.66, and 0.61 mm. O-ring aortic banding resulted in 98.7% survival 2 weeks post-surgery, with very low intra- and inter-surgeon variation. When using the narrowest o-ring (0.61 mm), mice developed hypertrophy within 1 week. Over 20 weeks, the mice gradually developed reduced LV ejection fraction (LVEF) and dilatation with increased left atrial dimensions and lung weight, indicating congestion. When using o-rings with IDs of 0.66 mm and 0.71 mm, the mice developed hypertrophy, but maintained a compensated state with stabilized LVEF 8-20 weeks post-surgery. The up-regulation of signature genes associated with HF, hypertrophy, fibrosis, and the level of activation of MAPK and NFAT signalling pathways corresponded to the degree of stenosis. Conclusion Here, we introduce a novel method for high precision aortic constriction in mice with high intra- and inter-surgeon reproducibility and low post-operative mortality that allows generation of specific cardiac disease phenotypes.","Melleby, Arne O; Romaine, Andreas; Aronsen, Jan Magnus; Veras, Ioanni; Zhang, Lili; Sjaastad, Ivar; Lunde, Ida G; Christensen, Geir",Cardiovascular research,99,1

Although many people tend to react resiliently to stress, others appear to display emotional anxiety and depression-related symptoms. In this study, we carried out a survey (N = 10,053) during the first week of the general lockdown (quarantine) in Argentina to measure early affective reactions in Argentine adults. Respondents showed substantial anxious and depressive symptoms, with 33% and 23% of participants reporting possible depressive and anxious syndromes, respectively, with the youngest group (18 to 25 y.o.) showing the highest prevalence of symptoms. Even if prior mental health problems predisposed or aggravated the reaction, participants without prior complaints showed signs of psychological impact. Using linear regression, the most important independent variables related to depressive symptoms were the feeling of loneliness followed by daily stress. In the case of anxious states, the strongest variables were negative repetitive thinking and feeling of loneliness. Other psychological, economic, and social factors are discussed. This study is in line with previous literature that highlight the importance of the psychological impact of pandemics, but additionally demonstrates that these reactions are present at a large scale immediately after the start of quarantine with very low infectious rates as an early anticipatory adaptive reaction leading to potential negative outcomes from adjustment disorders to major disorders. In addition, the present results provide potentially relevant information about sudden environmental impacts on affective states and specific pathways for anxiety and depression to be expressed. We end by discussing implications for public policy based on considering the most vulnerable groups.","Torrente, F; Yoris, A; Low, D M; Lopez, P; Bekinschtein, P; Manes, F; Cetkovich, M",Journal of affective disorders,99,1

However, the pandemic has also afflicted the mental health of the population at large in the domains of anxiety and sleep disruption, potentially interfering with cognitive function. From an aviation perspective, safely operating an aircraft requires an airmans cognitive engagement for: 1) situational awareness, 2) spatial orientation, and 3) avionics programming. Since impaired cognitive function could interfere with such tasks, the current study was undertaken to determine if flight safety for a cohort of single engine, piston-powered light airplanes was adversely affected during a period of the pandemic (MarchOctober 2020) prior to U.S. approval of the first COVID-19 vaccine. METHODS: Airplane accidents were per the National Transportation Safety Board Access database. Fleet times were derived using Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast. Statistics used Poisson distributions, Chi-squared/Fisher, and Mann-Whitney tests. RESULTS: Little difference in accident rate was evident between the pandemic period (MarchOctober 2020) and the preceding (JanuaryFebruary) months (19 and 22 mishaps/100,000 h, respectively). Similarly, a proportional comparison of accidents occurring in 2020 with those for the corresponding months in 2019 failed to show over-representation of mishaps during the pandemic. Although a trend to a higher injury severity (43% vs. 34% serious/fatal injuries) was evident for pandemic-period mishaps, the proportional difference was not statistically significant when referencing the corresponding months in 2019. CONCLUSION: Surprisingly, using accidents as an outcome, the study herein shows little evidence of diminished flight safety for light aircraft operations during the COVID-19 pandemic. Boyd DD.

An outstanding question is whether individual reaction norm (RN) slopes are consistent across different environmental variables-that is, whether an individual that is highly responsive to one environmental variable will be equally responsive to a second variable. Another important and related question is whether RNs are themselves consistently expressed through time or whether they are simply state dependent. Here, we quantified individual activity rates of zebrafish in response to independent manipulations of temperature and food availability that were repeated in discrete 'bursts' of sampling through time. Individuals that were thermally responsive were not more responsive to food deprivation, but they did exhibit greater unexplained variation. Individual RN slopes were consistent (repeatable) over time for both temperature (Rslope = 0.92) and food deprivation responses (Rslope = 0.4), as were mean activity rates in the standard environment (Rintercept = 0.83). Despite the high potential lability of behaviour, we have demonstrated consistency of behavioural RN components and identified potential energetic constraints leading to high consistency of thermal RNs and low consistency of food deprivation RNs.","Mitchell, David J; Biro, Peter A",Proceedings.

Increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) are causal in sarcolemmal dislocation of nNOS and FoxO3a activation. The Nox2 isoform of NADPH oxidase and mitochondria release ROS during disuse in skeletal muscle. Activation of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) can elicit Nox2 complex formation. The AT1R blocker losartan was used to test the hypothesis that AT1R activation drives Nox2 assembly, nNOS dislocation, FoxO3a activation, and thus alterations in morphology in the unloaded rat soleus. Male Fischer 344 rats were divided into four groups: ambulatory control (CON), ambulatory + losartan (40 mg kg-1 day-1 ) (CONL), 7 days of tail-traction hindlimb unloading (HU), and HU + losartan (HUL). Losartan attenuated unloading-induced loss of muscle fiber cross-sectional area (CSA) and fiber-type shift. Losartan mitigated unloading-induced elevation of ROS levels and upregulation of Nox2. Furthermore, AT1R blockade abrogated nNOS dislocation away from the sarcolemma and elevation of nuclear FoxO3a. We conclude that AT1R blockade attenuates disuse remodeling by inhibiting Nox2, thereby lessening nNOS dislocation and activation of FoxO3a.","Hord, Jeffrey M; Garcia, Marcela M; Farris, Katherine R; Guzzoni, Vinicius; Lee, Yang; Lawler, Matthew S; Lawler, John M",Physiological reports,99,16

DESIGN A 48-year-old female university professor, gynecologist, and obstetrician with a history of laryngopharyngeal reflux and a left vocal polyp participated. Treatment was provided in 10 sessions. Pre- and post-treatment audio recordings of sustained vowels, selected sentences, and connected speech samples were submitted to auditory-perceptual and acoustical analysis to assess the effects of the two-treatment program. Also, laryngoscopic images, perceptions by the patient about her voice quality and quality of life before and after therapy were assessed. RESULTS Improvements in acoustic parameters were obtained especially in perturbation and CCPS parameters. The overall voice quality scores on the CAPE-V were moderate before therapy and became mild after therapy. Laryngoscopy images demonstrated improvement in the glottis closure configuration in two phases (open and close) in pre- and post- CVM therapy and a decrease in polyp size. The patient had improvement in VAS, IVQLP, and VRQOL scores. CONCLUSION The CVM therapy used in the study resulted in positive changes in acoustic and perceptual-auditory aspects of voice production, self-report, and QOL for the patient. The CVM approach appears to have been effective for this case in decreasing the polyp size or its regression or for vocal adaptation.","Dehqan, Ali",Journal of voice : official journal of the Voice Foundation,99,29

The secondary objective is to describe the impact of the Covid-19 epidemic in FVG and in the Regions of Northern and Central Italy in terms of incidence and mortality compared to the national data. DESIGN retrospective cohort study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS resident population in FVG in the period between 29 February and 25 June 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES in order to describe the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak in FVG, in terms of incidence and mortality compared to the national data, the standardized incidence (SIR) and mortality (SMR) ratios and their respective 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were calculated compared to the Italian population for the northern and central Regions of Italy and the autonomous Provinces (PA) of Trento and Bolzano. A retrospective cohort study was conducted on subjects residing in FVG to whom at least one naso-oropharyngeal swab (hereafter, named swab) resulted positive for Covid-19. For each subject included in the cohort, the observation period started with the first positive swab and ended with the first of the following events: death, recovery or censored, which means that at the end of the observation period the subject was still alive and positive. The cause of death was assigned to Covid-19 if a subject had not yet recovered at the time when the event occurred. Cohort members were considered recovered after two negative consecutive swabs. The sub-hazard ratio (SHR) was estimated by applying the regression model of competing risks by Fine and Gray, in which the event of interest was the death caused by Covid-19 and the competing event was recovery. The explanatory variables included in the multiple models are: gender, age at the beginning of the observation period, the Province of residence, and nursing home residency. The cause-specific hazard was estimated using Cox proportional hazard regression. RESULTS during the observation period, 3,305 cases and 345 deaths were recorded in FVG; SIR and SMR resulted, respectively, equal to 0.64 (95%CI 0.61-0.68) and 0.43 (95%CI 0.37-0.50). The FVG was the Northern Region one with the lowest incidence and mortality. The cohort consisted of 3,121 residents in FVG with at least one swab with a positive Covid-19 result during the study period. The SHR of dying for Covid-19 is equal to 16.13 (95%CI 9.73-26.74) for people with age 70-79 years and 35.58 (95%CI 21.77-58.15) with age >=80 years respect those with age <70 years. It is higher in males (SHR 1.71; 95%CI 1.34-2.17). There is no evidence that being resident in a nursing home affects the SHR (SHR 0.91 and 95%CI 0.69-1.20). As regards the province as an explanatory variable, the sub-hazard of death in the province of Trieste appears to overlap to the sub-hazard of Pordenone used as a reference; for the provinces of Udine and Gorizia the sub-hazards seem lower than the reference. CONCLUSIONS while other Northern Regions and autonomous Provinces show higher standardized incidence and mortality compared with Italy, FVG and Veneto do not. In FVG, male gender and age are important determinants of death while there is no evidence that the condition of guest in a nursing home increases the sub-hazard of death.","Castriotta, Luigi; Roselen, Valentina; Rosolen, Valentina; Barbone, Fabiano; Tomietto, Marco; de Dottori, Margherita; Barbone, Fabio; Zamaro, Gianna",Epidemiologia e prevenzione,99,1

Transportal approach can be considered as a method of delivering organoids to the liver. It is important to set the allowable organoid amount and verify translocation by intraportal transplantation. We first examined the transplantation tolerance and translocation of porcine fetal liver-derived allogeneic organoids using piglets. Fetal liver-derived organoids generated from the Kusabira Orange-transduced pig were transplanted to the 10-day-old piglet liver through the left branch of the portal vein. All recipients survived without any observable adverse events. In contrast, both local and main portal pressures increased transiently during transplantation. In necropsy samples, Kusabira Orange-positive donor cells were detected primarily in the target lobe of the liver and partly in other areas, including the lungs and brain. As we confirmed the transplantation allowance by porcine fetal liver-derived organoids, we performed intraportal transplantation of human-induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived liver organoid, which we plan to use in clinical trials, and portal pressure and translocation were investigated. Human iPSC-derived liver organoids were transplanted into the same 10-day-old piglet. Portal hypertension and translocation of human iPSC-derived liver organoids to the lungs were observed in one of two transplanted animals. Translocation occurred in the piglet in which patent ductus venosus (PDV) was observed. Therefore, a 28-day-old piglet capable of surgically ligating PDV was used, and after the PDV was ligated, human iPSC-derived liver organoids with the amount of which is scheduled in clinical trials were transplanted. This procedure inhibited the translocation of human iPSC-derived liver organoids to extrahepatic sites without no portal hypertension. In conclusion, human iPSC-derived liver organoids can be safely transplanted through the portal vein. Ligation of the ductus venosus prior to transplantation was effective in inhibiting extrahepatic translocation in newborns and infants.","Tsuchida, Tomonori; Murata, Soichiro; Hasegawa, Shunsuke; Mikami, Satoshi; Enosawa, Shin; Hsu, Huai-Che; Fukuda, Akinari; Okamoto, Satoshi; Mori, Akihiro; Matsuo, Megumi; Kawakatsu, Yumi; Matsunari, Hitomi; Nakano, Kazuaki; Nagashima, Hiroshi; Taniguchi, Hideki",Cell transplantation,99,20

In the European Union (EU), clinical studies outside the EU directives concerning medicinal products or medical devices, i.e., ""miscellaneous clinical studies"", have no legally mandated timelines for institutional review boards' (IRB) decisions. GOAL To evaluate the review process of IRBs for two different ""miscellaneous"" multicenter clinical research protocols involving vulnerable subjects (children and adult stroke patients). METHODS Descriptive and comparative statistics. Protocol 1 is a prospective, multicenter, cross-sectional screening study of a symptomatic pediatric population at risk for Fabry disease involving genetic testing (NCT02152189). Protocol 2 is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled, open-label, blinded endpoint post-market study to evaluate the effectiveness of stent retrievers (NCT02135926). After having obtained positive initial IRB votes at the main study site, both protocols were subsequently submitted to the remaining IRBs. RESULTS Protocol 1 was submitted to 19 IRBs. No IRB objected to the study. Median time-to-final vote was 34 (IQR 10-65; range 0 to 130) days. Two IRBs accepted the coordinating center's IRB votes without re-evaluation. Changes to the informed consent documents were asked by 7/19 IRBs, amendments to the protocol by 2. Protocol 2 was submitted to 16 IRBs. Fifteen decisions were made. No IRB objected to the study. Median time-to final vote was 59 (IQR 10 to 65; range 0 to 128) days, which was not statistically significantly different compared with protocol 1 (Wilcoxon test). Two IRBs accepted a previous IRB decision and did not conduct an independent review. Eight/16 IRBs required changes to the informed consent documents; two IRBs recommended an amendment of the protocol. CONCLUSION Both clinical research protocols involving vulnerable populations were well accepted. IRB workflows and decision times varied substantially. Some IRBs accepted a previous IRB decision without the necessity of another reevaluation process. Requested changes were focused on the informed consent documents. A more standardized approach across jurisdictions is desirable.","Kästner, Bärbel; Behre, Simone; Lutz, Nadine; Bürger, Friederike; Luntz, Steffen; Hinderhofer, Katrin; Bendszus, Martin; Hoffmann, Georg F; Ries, Markus",PloS one,99,1

Recently a new variant, H7N9, has emerged in China causing global concern. First, there have been more than 130 laboratory-confirmed human infections resulting in an alarmingly high death rate (32.3%). Second, genetic changes found in H7N9 appear to be associated with enabling avian influenza viruses to spread more effectively in mammals, thus transmitting infections on a larger scale. Currently, no vaccines or drugs are effectively able to target H7N9. Here, we report the rapid development of a synthetic consensus DNA vaccine (pH7HA) to elicit potent protective immunity against the H7N9 viruses. We show that pH7HA induces broad antibody responses that bind to divergent HAs from multiple new members of the H7N9 family. These antibody responses result in high-titer HAI against H7N9. Simultaneously, this vaccine induces potent polyfunctional effector CD4 and CD8T cell memory responses. Animals vaccinated with pH7HA are completely protected from H7N9 virus infection and any morbidity associated with lethal challenge. This study establishes that this synthetic consensus DNA vaccine represents a new tool for targeting emerging infection, and more importantly, its design, testing and development into seed stock for vaccine production in a few days in the pandemic setting has significant implications for the rapid deployment of vaccines protecting against emerging infectious diseases.","Yan, Jian; Villarreal, Daniel O; Racine, Trina; Chu, Jaemi S; Walters, Jewell N; Morrow, Matthew P; Khan, Amir S; Sardesai, Niranjan Y; Kim, J Joseph; Kobinger, Gary P; Weiner, David B",Vaccine,99,1

We aimed to describe the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on HIV testing and treatment and to describe strategies employed to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on HIV care. METHODS In this retrospective cohort study, we used secondary data from the AIDS Healthcare Foundation (AHF) Global Quality Program from 44 countries in four continents (Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, Europe and Africa), and compared information on HIV testing, percentage of positive results, number of in-person appointments, and number of new enrolments in HIV care from 1 January 2020 to 31 August 2020 with the equivalent period in 2019. RESULTS Despite marked inter-country heterogeneities, we found that COVID-19 was associated with a significant reduction in HIV testing, an increase in the percentage of positive tests, a reduction in the number of in-person consultations and a reduction in the number of new enrolments in care, despite the implementation of several mitigation strategies. The impact of COVID-19 differed across continents and key populations. CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest that, in the years to come, health care services must be prepared to respond to the impact of COVID-19 on HIV testing and care. Providers and facilities should build on the lessons learned so far to further improve mitigation strategies and establish care priorities for both the pandemic and the post-pandemic periods.","Rick, Fernanda; Odoke, Wilfred; van den Hombergh, Jan; Benzaken, Adele S; Avelino-Silva, Vivian I",HIV medicine,99,7

Thus, timely primary PCI has been emphasized in order to improve outcomes. Despite guideline recommendations on trying to reduce the door-to-balloon time to <90 minutes in order to reduce mortality, less attention has been paid to other components of time to treatment, such as the symptom-to-balloon time, as an indicator of the total ischemic time, which includes the symptom-to-door time and door-to-balloon time, in terms of clinical outcomes of patients with STEMI undergoing primary PCI. OBJECTIVE We aimed to determine the association between each component of time to treatment (ie, symptom-to-door time, door-to-balloon time, and symptom-to-balloon time) and in-hospital MACCEs among patients with STEMI who underwent primary PCI. METHODS In this observational study, according to a prospective primary PCI 24/7 service registry, adult patients with STEMI who underwent primary PCI in one of six catheterization laboratories of Tehran Heart Center from November 2015 to August 2019, were studied. The primary outcome was in-hospital MACCEs, which was a composite index consisting of cardiac death, revascularization (ie, target vessel revascularization/target lesion revascularization), myocardial infarction, and stroke. It was compared at different levels of time to treatment (ie, symptom-to-door and door-to-balloon time <90 and ≥90 minutes, and symptom-to-balloon time <180 and ≥180 minutes). Data were analyzed using SPSS software version 24 (IBM Corp), with descriptive statistics, such as frequency, percentage, mean, and standard deviation, and statistical tests, such as chi-square test, t test, and univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses, and with a significance level of <.05 and 95% CIs for odds ratios (ORs). RESULTS Data from 2823 out of 3204 patients were analyzed (mean age of 59.6 years, SD 11.6 years; 79.5% male [n=2243]; completion rate: 88.1%). Low proportions of symptom-to-door time ≤90 minutes and symptom-to-balloon time ≤180 minutes were observed among the study patients (579/2823, 20.5% and 691/2823, 24.5%, respectively). Overall, 2.4% (69/2823) of the patients experienced in-hospital MACCEs, and cardiac death (45/2823, 1.6%) was the most common cardiac outcome. In the univariate analysis, the symptom-to-balloon time predicted in-hospital MACCEs (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.1-4.4; P=.03), while the symptom-to-door time (OR 1.4, 95% CI 0.7-2.6; P=.34) and door-to-balloon time (OR 1.1, 95% CI 0.6-1.8, P=.77) were not associated with in-hospital MACCEs. In the multivariate analysis, only symptom-to-balloon time ≥180 minutes was associated with in-hospital MACCEs and was a predictor of in-hospital MACCEs (OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.1-5.2; P=.04). CONCLUSIONS A longer symptom-to-balloon time was the only component associated with higher in-hospital MACCEs in the present study. Efforts should be made to shorten the symptom-to-balloon time in order to improve in-hospital MACCEs.

METHOD Sixteen female patients (four with total prolapse, twelve with intussusception) underwent robot-assisted ventral mesh rectopexy (RVMR) and 14 female patients (two with prolapse, twelve with intussusception) laparoscopic ventral mesh rectopexy (LVMR). Primary outcome measures were perioperative parameters, complications and restoration of anatomy as assessed by MR defaecography, which was performed preoperatively and 3 months after surgery. RESULTS Patient demographics, operation length, operating theatre times and length of in-hospital stay were similar between the groups. The anatomical defects of rectal prolapse, intussusception and rectocele and enterocele were similarly corrected after rectopexy in either technique as confirmed with dynamic MR defaecography. A slight residual intussusception was observed in three patients with primary total prolapse (two RVMR vs one LVMR) and in one patient with primary intussusception (RVMR) (P = 0.60). Rectocele was reduced from a mean of 33.0 ± 14.9 mm to 5.5 ± 8.4 mm after RVMR (P < 0.001) and from 24.7 ± 17.5 mm to 7.2 ± 3.2 mm after LVMR (P < 0.001) (RVMR vs LVMR, P = 0.10). CONCLUSION Robot-assisted laparoscopic ventral rectopexy can be performed safely and within the same operative time as conventional laparoscopy. Minimally invasive ventral rectopexy allows good anatomical correction as assessed by MR defaecography, with no differences between the techniques.","Mäkelä-Kaikkonen, J; Rautio, T; Pääkkö, E; Biancari, F; Ohtonen, P; Mäkelä, J",Colorectal disease : the official journal of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland,99,1

Still, clinical outcomes and financial issues have been subjects of debate. Several studies have demonstrated higher costs for robotic surgery when compared to laparoscopy or open surgery. However, other studies showed fewer costly anastomotic complications after robotic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGBP) when compared to laparoscopy. METHODS We collected data for our gastric bypass patients who underwent open, laparoscopic, or robotic surgery from June 1997 to July 2010. Demographic data, BMI, complications, mortality, intensive care unit stay, hospitalization, and operating room (OR) costs were analyzed and a cost projection completed. Sensitivity analyses were performed for varied leak rates during laparoscopy, number of robotic cases per month, number of additional staplers during robotic surgery, and varied OR times for robotic cases. RESULTS Nine-hundred ninety patients underwent gastric bypass surgery at the University Hospital Geneva from June 1997 to July 2010. There were 524 open, 323 laparoscopic, and 143 robotic cases. Significantly fewer anastomotic complications occurred after open and robotic RYGBP when compared to laparoscopy. OR material costs were slightly less for robotic surgery (USD 5,427) than for laparoscopy (USD 5,494), but more than for the open procedure (USD 2,251). Overall, robotic gastric bypass (USD 19,363) was cheaper when compared to laparoscopy (USD 21,697) and open surgery (USD 23,000). CONCLUSIONS Robotic RYGBP can be cost effective due to balancing greater robotic overhead costs with the savings associated with avoiding stapler use and costly anastomotic complications.","Hagen, Monika E; Pugin, Francois; Chassot, Gilles; Huber, Olivier; Buchs, Nicolas; Iranmanesh, Pouya; Morel, Philippe",Obesity surgery,99,1

Tree deaths represent a threat for fauna that are dependent on forest habitats for their survival. Although tree declines have received considerable scientific attention, surprisingly, little is known about their impacts on fauna. In total, we calculated 631 effect sizes across 59 studies that quantified the impact of tree declines on animal abundance. Data representing 186 bird species indicated an overall increase in bird abundance in response to tree declines (meta-analysis mean ± estimation g = 0.172 ± 0.053 [CI 0.069 to 0.275], P = 0.001); however, there was substantial variability in responses (significant heterogeneity P < 0.001) with a strong influence of diet as well as nesting guild on bird responses. Granivores (especially ground-foraging species, e.g. Passerellidae species), bark-foraging insectivores (e.g. woodpeckers), as well as ground- and cavity-nesting species apparently benefitted from tree declines, while nectarivorous birds [and, although not significant, aerially foraging insectivores (e.g. flycatchers) and leaf-gleaning insectivores (canopy-feeding)] were less common in the presence of tree declines. Data representing 33 mammal species indicate a tendency for detrimental effects of tree declines on mammals that use trees as refuges, while aerial foragers (i.e. bats) may benefit from opening up the canopy. Overall the average effect for mammals was neutral (meta-analysis mean estimation g = -0.150 ± 0.145 [-0.433 to 0.134], P = 0.302). Data representing 20 reptile species showed an insufficient range of responses to determine any diet or foraging effect on their responses. Data for 28 arthropod taxa should be considered with caution, as we could not adequately separate taxa according to their specialisations and reliance on key habitat. The data broadly suggest a detrimental effect of tree declines (meta-analysis mean estimation g = -0.171 ± 0.072 [-0.311 to -0.031], P = 0.017) with ground-foraging arthropods (e.g. detritivores and predators such as spiders and centipedes) more likely to be detrimentally impacted by tree declines. The range of responses to tree declines signifies substantially altered animal communities. In many instances, altered ecosystem function due to loss of key animal services will represent a significant threat to forest health.","Fleming, Patricia A; Wentzel, Jacobus J; Dundas, Shannon J; Kreplins, Tracey L; Craig, Michael D; Hardy, Giles E St J",Biological reviews of the Cambridge Philosophical Society,99,19

The objective of this study is to quantify our experience of telestroke (TS) consults at a large tertiary comprehensive stroke center during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed TS consults of patients presenting to our neuroscience network. Those with a confirmed diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemia attack were included. Data were compared from April 1, 2019, to June 30, 2020, which include consults prepandemic and during the crisis. Results: A total of 1,982 TS consults were provided in 1 year. Prepandemic, the mean monthly consults were 148. In April 2020, only 59 patients were seen (49% decline). Mobile stroke unit consults decreased by 72% in the same month. The 30-day moving average of patients seen per day was between five and six prepandemic declined to between two and three in April, and then began to uptrend during May. The mean percentage of patients receiving intravenous tissue plasminogen activator was 16% from April 2019 to March 2020 and increased to 31% in April 2020. The mean percentage of patients receiving endovascular therapy was 10% from April 2019 to March 2020 and increased to 19% in April 2020. Conclusions: At our large tertiary comprehensive stroke center, we observed a significant and rapid decline in TS consults during the COVID-19 pandemic. We cannot be certain of the reasons for the decline, but a fear of contracting coronavirus, social distancing, and isolation likely played a major role. Further research must be done to elucidate the etiology of this decline.","Shah, Syed Omar; Dharia, Robin; Stazi, Jaime; DePrince, Maureen; Rosenwasser, Robert H",Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,99,1

RVDIEN are anatomically neovascularized. Indocyanine green (ICG) reveals vascularized structures when becoming fluorescent after exposure to near-infrared (NIR) light. This study aims to evaluate if fluorescence-guided surgery can improve the laparoscopic resection of RVDIEN, thus avoiding a rectal perforation. MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients with a symptomatic RVDIEN, scheduled for a laparoscopic rectal shaving, were enrolled in the study. Technically, the RVDIEN was targeted and removed with the help of the NIR imager device Image 1 Spies (Karl Storz GmBH & Co KG, Tuttlingen, Germany) or Visera Elite II (Olympus Europe SE & Co KG, Hamburg, Germany), after an intraoperative, intravenous injection of ICG (0.25 mg/kg). RESULTS Six patients underwent a fluorescence-guided laparoscopic shaving procedure for the treatment of a nonobstructive RVDIEN. Fluorescence of the RVDIEN was observed in all the patients. In one patient, once the main lesion was removed, the posterior vaginal fornix still appeared fluorescent and was removed. No intraoperative rectal perforation occurred. The postoperative hospital stay was 2 days. No postoperative rectovaginal fistula occurred within a median follow-up of 16 months (range = 2-23 months). CONCLUSION In this preliminary study, fluorescence-guided laparoscopy appeared to help in separating the RVDIEN from the healthy rectal tissue, without rectal perforation. Moreover, this technique was helpful in deciding if the resection needed to be enlarged to the posterior vaginal fornix.","De Neef, Auriane; Cadière, Guy-Bernard; Bourgeois, Pierre; Barbieux, Romain; Dapri, Giovanni; Fastrez, Maxime",Surgical innovation,99,1

It is unclear whether sleep disturbance in specific rhinologic disorders (chronic rhinosinusitis [CRS], rhinitis, and nasal septal deviation [NSD]) is an obstructive phenomenon or due to other mechanisms. In this review we examine the impact of CRS, rhinitis, and NSD on objective and subjective sleep outcome metrics and draw comparisons to normal controls and patients with known obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). METHODS A systematic review of 4 databases (PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science) was performed. Studies reporting on objective (apnea-hypopnea index [AHI], respiratory disturbance index [RDI], oxygen nadir) and subjective (Epworth Sleepiness Scale [EpSS], Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index [PSQI], Fatigue Severity Scale [FSS]) sleep parameters and disease-specific patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs; 22-item Sino-Nasal Outcome Test [SNOT-22], Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire [RQLQ], Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation [NOSE]) were included. RESULTS The database search yielded 1414 unique articles, of which 103 were included for analysis. Baseline PROMs were at the high end of normal to abnormal for all 3 conditions: EpSS: CRS (9.8 ± 4.0), rhinitis (9.7 ± 4.3), and NSD (8.9 ± 4.6); and PSQI: CRS (11.0 ± 4.5), rhinitis (6.1 ± 3.7), and NSD (8.6 ± 3.5). Objective measures demonstrated a mild to moderate OSA in the studied diseases: AHI: CRS (10.4 ± 11.5), rhinitis (8.6 ± 8.8), and NSD (13.0 ± 6.9). There were significant differences when compared with reported norms in all measured outcomes (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION Sleep quality is impacted by rhinologic (CRS, rhinitis, NSD) disease. There is likely a mild obstructive component contributing to poor sleep, but other contributing factors may be involved.","Fried, Jacob; Yuen, Erick; Li, Andraia; Zhang, Kathy; Nguyen, Shaun A; Gudis, David A; Rowan, Nicholas R; Schlosser, Rodney J",International forum of allergy & rhinology,99,27

Furthermore, there have been no reports of single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) for NEJ-SMTs. We evaluated our laparoscopic surgical outcomes for NEJ-SMTs, including a newly introduced phase of SILS. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed a total of 18 patients diagnosed with NEJ-SMTs who underwent laparoscopic surgery between April 2002 and September 2013. RESULTS All patients underwent laparoscopic gastric resection without local complications and with a negative surgical margin, including 12 patients treated with conventional laparoscopic surgery (CLS) and six patients treated with SILS. The mean length of the operation was 184.3 ± 52.3 min, and the mean blood loss was 19.2 ± 17.7 mL. All patients underwent complete resection. There were no statistically significant differences between the CLS and SILS groups in terms of the surgical outcomes. CONCLUSION Despite this challenging location of the tumor, laparoscopic gastric resection for NEJ-SMTs is safe and feasible. Furthermore, SILS can provide a better cosmetic result, which can lead to better global patient satisfaction in carefully selected patients with NEJ-SMTs.","Kanaji, Shingo; Nakamura, Tetsu; Yamamoto, Masashi; Imanishi, Tatsuya; Suzuki, Satoshi; Tanaka, Kenichi; Kuroda, Daisuke; Kakeji, Yoshihiro",Surgery today,99,31

A modified small interfering RNA (siRNA) containing 5'-triphosphate, 3p-siRNA, was shown to induce RNA interference and interferon activation. We aimed to develop a potent antiviral treatment using CVB3-specific 3p-siRNA and to understand its underlying mechanisms. Virus-specific 3p-siRNA was superior to both conventional virus-specific siRNA with an empty hydroxyl group at the 5' end (OH-siRNA) and nonspecific 3p-siRNA in decreasing viral replication and subsequent cytotoxicity. A single administration of 3p-siRNA dramatically attenuated virus-associated pathological symptoms in mice with no signs of toxicity, and their body weights eventually reached the normal range. Myocardial inflammation and fibrosis were rare, and virus production was greatly reduced. A nonspecific 3p-siRNA showed relatively less protective effect under identical conditions, and a virus-specific OH-siRNA showed no protective effects. We confirmed that virus-specific 3p-siRNA simultaneously activated target-specific gene silencing and type I interferon signaling. We provide a clear proof of concept that coxsackievirus B3-specific 3p-siRNA has 2 distinct modes of action, which significantly enhance antiviral activities with minimal organ damage. This is the first direct demonstration of improved antiviral effects with an immunostimulatory virus-specific siRNA in coxsackievirus myocarditis, and this method could be applied to many virus-related diseases.","Ahn, Jeonghyun; Ko, Ara; Jun, Eun Jung; Won, Minah; Kim, Yoo Kyum; Ju, Eun-Seon; Jeon, Eun Seok; Lee, Heuiran",Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,99,17

Intra- and inter-session reliability of motor threshold (MT), area under the curve (AURC), MEPmax, stimulation intensity at which the MEP is mid-way between MEPmax and MEPmin (I50), slope in I50, MEP latency, and silent period (SP) were assessed in terms of Standard Error of Measurement (SEM), relative SEM, Minimum Detectable Change (MDC), and Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC). RESULTS The relative SEM was ≤10% for MT, I50, latency and SP both at rest and 5%MVC, while it ranged between 11% and 37% for AURC, MEPmax, and slope. MDC values were overall quite large; e.g., MT required a change of 12%MSO at rest and 10%MSO at 5%MVC to be considered a real change. Inter-sessions ICC were >0.6 for all measures but slope at rest and MEPmax and latency at 5%MVC. CONCLUSIONS Measures derived from SR curves acquired in <4 minutes are affected by similar measurement errors to those found with long-lasting protocols, suggesting that the rapid method is at least as reliable as the traditional methods. As specifically designed to include older adults, this study provides normative data for future studies involving older neurological patients (e.g. stroke survivors).","Peri, Elisabetta; Ambrosini, Emilia; Colombo, Vera Maria; van de Ruit, Mark; Grey, Michael J; Monticone, Marco; Ferriero, Giorgio; Pedrocchi, Alessandra; Ferrigno, Giancarlo; Ferrante, Simona",PloS one,99,24

METHODS A single port was placed at the umbilicus. Sigmoid colon was retracted using transabdominal sutures. After adequate mobilization, the colon was stapled distal to the lesion using noncutting endostapler, and the rectum was opened distal to the staple line. The transanal endoscopic operation device was placed transanally and the anvil of a circular stapler was then delivered through the device into the peritoneal cavity. The anvil was placed intraluminally through a colotomy made proximal to the lesion; after this, the colon was transected above the colotomy site. The specimen was next delivered transanally through the transanal endoscopic operation device. Finally, the rectum was closed with endostapler and intracorporeal side-to-end colorectal anastomosis was constructed using the circular stapler. RESULTS This technique was attempted in an 80-year-old woman with a 3 cm sessile polyp in the distal sigmoid. Laparoscopic anterior resection was arranged as the polyp was not amenable to endoscopic removal. The operative time was 150 minutes. There was no intraoperative complication. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 6, with a maximum pain score of 3. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic anterior resection using this combined single-port and endoluminal technique is feasible for small lesions in the sigmoid colon or upper rectum. The technique avoids multiple trocar incisions and a minilaparotomy for specimen retrieval.","Co, Catherine S; Cheung, Hester Yui Shan; Yau, Kevin K; Chung, Cliff C; Li, Michael","Surgical laparoscopy, endoscopy & percutaneous techniques",99,1

Immune responses required for mucosal protection can differ vastly depending on the individual pathogen. For some mucosal pathogens, including acute self-limiting infections, high-titer neutralizing Abs that enter tissue parenchyma or transude into the mucosal lumen are sufficient for clearing cell-free virus. However, for pathogens causing chronic infections such as HIV, hepatitis C virus, herpes viruses, mycobacteria, and fungal and parasitic infections, a single arm of the immune response generated by systemic vaccination may be insufficient for protection. Induction of the mucosal innate and adaptive immune systems, including CD4+ T help, Th17, high avidity CD8+ CTL, and secretory IgA and IgG1 neutralizing Abs, at the site of pathogen entry may be required for effective protection against highly invasive pathogens that lead to chronic infection and may be generated predominantly by mucosal vaccination.","Belyakov, Igor M; Ahlers, Jeffrey D",Journal of immunology,99,7

METHOD Experimental wounds produced in an in vitro porcine wound model were homogenously contaminated with bacterial suspension and treated with NPWT and different options. Group A: non-antimicrobial polyurethane foam dressing; group B: antimicrobial polyurethane foam dressing containing silver; group C: antimicrobial gauze dressing containing polyhexanide; group D: non-antimicrobial polyurethane foam dressing intermittently irrigated with octenidine; group E: negative control (non-antimicrobial polyurethane foam dressing without NPWT). Standard biopsies were harvested after 24 and 28 hours. RESULTS This study demonstrated that the use of NPWT with intermitted instillation of octenidine (group D) or application of silver-based polyurethane foam dressings (group B) is significantly superior against Staphylococcus aureus colonisation in experimental wounds compared with non-antimicrobial polyurethane foam dressing (group A) after 48 hours. Surprisingly, the polyhexanide-based dressing (group C) used in this model showed no statistical significant effect compared with the control group (group E) after 24 or 48 hours of treatment. CONCLUSION Both intermitted instillation of octenidine and silver-based dressings in standard NPWT were significantly superior compared with non-antimicrobial polyurethane foam dressings or PHMB coated gauze dressing after 48 hours.","Matiasek, J; Domig, K J; Djedovic, G; Babeluk, R; Assadian, O",Journal of wound care,99,7

Few studies have assessed the positive psychological impact of politically motivated violence on health care workers. In this study, the level of positive psychological impact among health care workers with recurrent exposure to victims of politically motivated violence was examined. METHODS A validated questionnaire survey of health care personnel treating victims of politically motivated violence during 2000-2005 in two hospital settings was conducted. Positive psychological impact was assessed by the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory and traumatic stress symptoms were assessed using the Revised Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Inventory. Subjects included physicians (surgeons and anesthesiologists), nurses, and psychotherapists. RESULTS The rate of response to the mail-in questionnaires was 68.3% (n = 138). The sample consisted of 70 physicians, 37 nurses, and 31 hospital-based psychotherapists. Positive psychological impact was noted for the entire sample and among all professions. Traumatic stress symptoms predicted positive psychological impact for the entire sample and for each profession, and there was a curvilinear relationship between traumatic stress symptoms and positive psychological impact. Women experienced greater levels of positive psychological impact. CONCLUSIONS Hospital-based health care providers treating victims of politically motivated violence experience both positive and negative psychological impact. Individuals who are more traumatized by their experience are more likely to also have a positive psychological impact.","Shiri, Shimon; Wexler, Isaiah D; Alkalay, Yasmin; Meiner, Zeev; Kreitler, Shulamith",Psychotherapy and psychosomatics,99,1

However, coverage rates have stagnated and remained low for many years, suggesting the presence of systemic barriers to implementation. Hence, there is a need to consolidate the existing knowledge, in order to address them and consequently improve program effectiveness. METHODS A thorough literature review and Delphi method were used. In this review, we searched Pubmed/Medline, WHO library, Science direct, Cochrane library, Google scholar and Google using different combinations of search strategies. Studies that applied any study design, data collection and analysis methods related to immunization program were included. In the Delphi method, a panel of 28 national and international experts were participated to identify current evidence gaps and set research priorities under the immunization program. RESULTS In this review, a total of 55 studies and national documents were included. The review showed that the vaccination coverage ranged from 20.6% in Afar to 91.7% in Amhara region with large inequities related to socio-economic, health service access and knowledge about vaccination across different settings. Only one study reported evidence on timeliness of immunization as 60%. The review revealed that 80% of health facilities provide immunization service nationally while service availability was only 2% in private health facilities. This review indicated that poor vaccine storage, vaccine shortage, service interruptions, poor defaulter tracing, low community engagement and poor documentation were the main barriers for the Expanded Program on Immunization with variations across different regions. Through expert panel of discussion using Delphi method, 10 priority research areas were identified across different domains of the immunization program at national level. CONCLUSION We found out that there is substantial knowledge on vaccination coverage, however, there is little evidence on timeliness of vaccination. The existing barriers that affect full immunization coverage also varied from context to context which indicates there is a need to design and implement evidence based locally tailored interventions. This review also indicated evidence gaps with more focus on health system related implementation barriers at lower level and identified further research priorities in the immunization program of Ethiopia.","Tilahun, Binyam; Mekonnen, Zeleke; Sharkey, Alyssa; Shahabuddin, Asm; Feletto, Marta; Zelalem, Meseret; Sheikh, Kabir",BMC public health,99,1

We tested the hypothesis that perioperative in patients undergoing major non-cardiac surgery is inversely related to serious surgical outcomes. METHODS We enrolled 124 patients, ASA physical status ≤IV, having elective major non-cardiac surgeries with general anaesthesia. An InSpectra Model 650 StO(2) monitor (Hutchinson Technology, Hutchinson, MN, USA) was used to measure at the thenar eminence throughout surgery and for two postoperative hours. Our primary outcome was a composite of 30 day mortality and serious in-hospital complications. The secondary outcome was an a priori subset of the primary composite outcome representing infectious and wound-healing complications. Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate the associations between our primary and secondary outcomes and time-weighted average (TWA) and minimum . RESULTS Patients were 61 (12), mean (SD) yr old. The minimum was inversely associated with our primary composite outcome (P=0.02). The estimated odds ratio (97.5% CI) of having any major postoperative morbidity was 0.82 (0.67, 1.00) for a 5% increase in the minimum . In contrast, TWA was not significantly associated with major postoperative morbidity (P=0.35). Furthermore, neither TWA (P=0.65) nor minimum (P=0.70) was significantly associated with wound complications. CONCLUSIONS Minimum perioperative peripheral tissue oxygenation predicted a composite of major complications and mortality from major non-cardiac surgery. This is an observational association and whether clinical interventions to augment tissue oxygenation will improve outcomes remains to be determined.","Abdelmalak, B B; Cata, J P; Bonilla, A; You, J; Kopyeva, T; Vogel, J D; Campbell, S; Sessler, D I",British journal of anaesthesia,99,17

Nonetheless, comparative analyses with established techniques are limited in the published literature. We evaluated the efficacy of single-incision laparoscopic colectomy (SILC) for the treatment of sigmoid disease through a matched-case comparison with conventional laparoscopic colectomy (CLC). METHODS Twenty patients who underwent single-incision laparoscopic sigmoid resection for benign or malignant disease between July 2009 and September 2010 were matched to patients who underwent conventional laparoscopic sigmoid colectomy. Demographic, intraoperative, and postoperative data were assessed. RESULTS Twenty SILC and CLC cases each were paired based on gender (p < 1.0), age (p < 0.47), pathology (p < 1.0), and surgical procedure (p < 1.0). Ten patients (50%) in the SILC group and eight patients (40%) in the CLC group had a history of prior abdominal surgery (p < 0.53). There were no conversions to open surgery; however, one SILC procedure (5%) required conversion to CLC (p < 0.31). There was no significant difference in mean operating time between groups (p < 0.80). Mean estimated blood loss was significantly lower for SILC compared to CLC (p < 0.007). Mean lymph node extraction was comparable between groups in the subset of patients with malignant disease (p < 0.68). Two postoperative complications were encountered in each group. The mean length of hospital stay for SILC and CLC was 3.2 ± 1.0 and 3.8 ± 2.1 days, respectively (p < 0.25). There were no readmissions or reoperative interventions in either group. CONCLUSION Compared with conventional laparoscopic technique, single-incision laparoscopic surgery results in similar intraoperative and postoperative outcomes. The technique avoids use of multiple trocar sites and may safely be performed in patients with a history of previous abdominal surgery while maintaining a short length of hospital stay and low complication rate.","Ramos-Valadez, Diego I; Ragupathi, Madhu; Nieto, Javier; Patel, Chirag B; Miller, Steven; Pickron, T Bartley; Haas, Eric M",Surgical endoscopy,99,1

Currently, variations on surgical technique are being tested. This report describes the largest series of single-skin- and single-fascial-incision cholecystectomies using a multichannel port. METHODS Between July 2008 and December 2009, 55 patients underwent SILS cholecystectomy by two experienced general surgeons at a single institution. The operative time, surgical technique, conversion rate, specimen pathology, and postoperative complications were reported. RESULTS The reported series consisted of 43 women (78%) and 12 men (22%) with a mean age of 44.2 years (range, 22-89 years). The body mass index (BMI) of the patients ranged from 16.1 to 46.8 kg/m2 (mean, 29.1 kg/m2). The mean operating room (OR) time was 66.5 min (range, 30-140 min). An improvement in OR time was observed over the course of the study. The first 19 cases were managed through a single incision but with two fascial defects for port placement. The last 36 cases were performed through a single skin incision with a single fascial incision. In five cases, an extra port had to be placed, and one case was converted to open surgery. To date, no port-site hernias, wound infections, small bowel obstructions, or other postoperative complications have been observed. CONCLUSION The authors believe that the single-skin- and single-fascial-incision technique will prove superior to creation of multiple fascial defects in terms of future port-site hernias and will replace prior techniques using multiple fascial incisions.","Duron, Vincent P; Nicastri, Guy R; Gill, Peter S",Surgical endoscopy,99,20
127906,127906,127906,Effect Size Estimates for the ESCAPE Trial: Proportional Odds Regression Versus Other Statistical Methods.,15.505639,8.565834,2015,"BACKGROUND Although many surgical procedures are now routinely performed laparoscopically, pure laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy (LPD) is not commonly performed because of the technical difficulty of pancreatic resection and the associated reconstruction procedures. Several pancreatic-enteric anastomosis techniques for LPD have been reported, but most are adaptations of open procedures. To accomplish pure LPD, we consider it necessary to establish new pancreatic-enteric anastomosis techniques that are specifically developed for LPD and are safe and feasible to perform. RESULTS One patient developed a postoperative pancreatic fistula (International Study Group of Pancreatic Fistula criteria, grade B) and subsequent postoperative delayed gastric emptying (International Study Group of Pancreatic Surgery criteria, grade C). No other major complications occurred. We developed a novel pancreatic-gastric anastomosis technique that enabled us to safely perform pure LPD. The main pancreatic duct was stented with a 4-Fr polyvinyl catheter during pancreatic resection. A small hole was created in the posterior wall of the stomach and was bluntly dilated. A 5-cm incision was made in the anterior stomach, and the pancreatic drainage tube was passed into the stomach through the hole in the posterior wall. The remnant pancreas was pulled into the stomach, and was easily positioned and secured in place with only four to six sutures between the pancreatic capsule and the gastric mucosa. We used this technique to perform pure LPD in five patients between December 2012 and July 2013. CONCLUSIONS Our new technique is technically easy and provides secure fixation between the gastric wall and the pancreas. This technique does not require main pancreatic duct dilatation, and the risk of intra-abdominal abscess formation due to postoperative pancreatic fistula may be minimized. Although this technique requires further investigation as it may increase the risk of delayed gastric emptying, it may be a useful method of performing pancreaticogastrostomy in pure LPD.

This study sought to characterize the RA remodeling in HFpEF and to determine its prognostic significance. METHODS AND RESULTS Patients with HFpEF were classified based on the presence of RA enlargement (RA volume index >39 mL/m2 in men and >33 mL/m2 in women). Compared to patients with normal RA size (n=234), patients with RA dilation (n=67) showed a higher prevalence of atrial fibrillation (AF), worse right ventricular (RV) systolic function, more severe pulmonary hypertension (PH), and higher prevalence of mild tricuspid regurgitation (TR), and impaired RA reservoir function, with increased hepatobiliary enzyme levels. AF was strongly associated with the presence of RA dilation (odds ratio [OR] 10.2, CI [4.00-26.1] current AF vs no AF and OR 3.38, CI 1.26-9.07, earlier AF vs no AF). Patients with RA dilation had more than two-fold increased risk of composite outcomes of all-cause mortality or HF hospitalization (adjusted HR 2.01, 95% CI, 1.09-3.70-, p=0.02). The presence of RA dilation also displayed an additive prognostic value over left atrial dilation alone. CONCLUSIONS These data demonstrate that HFpEF with RA remodeling is associated with distinct echocardiographic features characterizing advanced right heart dysfunction with an increased risk of adverse outcomes.","Ikoma, Takahiro; Obokata, Masaru; Okada, Kenya; Harada, Tomonari; Sorimachi, Hidemi; Yoshida, Kuniko; Kato, Toshimitsu; Kurosawa, Koji; Kurabayashi, Masahiko; Murakami, Masami",Journal of cardiac failure,99,17

There are competing risks of mortality from cancer versus serious complications and higher risk of death from COVID-19 in immunocompromised hosts. Furthermore, compounding these concerns is the inadequate supply of personal protective equipment, decreased hospital capacity, and paucity of effective treatments or vaccines to date for COVID-19. Guidance measures and recommendations have been published by national organizations aiming to facilitate the delivery of care in a safe and effective manner, many of which, are permanently adoptable interventions. Given the critical importance to continue chemotherapy, there remains additional interventions to further enhance patient safety while conserving healthcare resources such as adjustments in medication administration, reduction in laboratory or drug monitoring, and home delivery of specialty infusions. In this manuscript, we outline how to implement these actionable interventions of chemotherapy and supportive care delivery to further enhance the current precautionary measures while maintaining safe and effective patient care.

The PRRSV virion consists of a lipid envelope that contains several envelope proteins surrounding a nucleocapsid core that encapsidates the RNA genome. To provide a better understanding of the structure and assembly of PRRSV, we have carried out cryo-electron microscopy and tomographic reconstruction of virions grown in MARC-145 cells. The virions are pleomorphic, round to egg-shaped particles with an average diameter of 58 nm. The particles display a smooth outer surface with only a few protruding features, presumably corresponding to the envelope protein complexes. The virions contain a double-layered, hollow core with an average diameter of 39 nm, which is separated from the envelope by a 2-3 nm gap. Analysis of the three-dimensional structure suggests that the core is composed of a double-layered chain of nucleocapsid proteins bundled into a hollow ball.","Spilman, Michael S; Welbon, Craig; Nelson, Eric; Dokland, Terje",The Journal of general virology,99,1

Optical coherence tomography (OCT) and OCT with angiography (OCTA) are non-invasive ophthalmic imaging tools with the potential to detect retinal structural and microvascular changes in patients with AD, which may serve as biomarkers for the disease. In this systematic review, we evaluate whether certain OCT and OCTA parameters are significantly associated with AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Methods PubMed database was searched using a combination of MeSH terms to identify studies for review. Studies were organized by participant diagnostic groups, type of imaging modality, and OCT/OCTA parameters of interest. Participant demographic data was also collected and baseline descriptive statistics were calculated for the included studies. Results Seventy-one studies were included for review, representing a total of 6757 patients (2350 AD, 793 MCI, 2902 healthy controls (HC), and 841 others with a range of other neurodegenerative diagnoses). The mean baseline ages were 72.78±3.69, 71.52±2.88, 70.55±3.85 years for AD, MCI and HC groups, respectively. The majority of studies noted significant structural and functional decline in AD patients when compared to HC. Although analysis of MCI groups yielded more mixed results, a similar pattern of decline was often noted amongst patients with MCI relative to HC. OCT and OCTA measurements were also shown to correlate with established measures of AD such as neuropsychological testing or neuroimaging. Conclusion OCT and OCTA show great potential as non-invasive technologies for the diagnosis of AD. However, further research is needed to determine whether there are AD-specific patterns of structural or microvascular change in the retina and optic nerve that distinguish AD from other neurodegenerative diseases. Development of sensitive and specific OCT/OCTA parameters will be necessary before they can be used to detect AD in clinical settings.","Song, Ailin; Johnson, Nicholas; Ayala, Alexandria; Thompson, Atalie C",Eye and brain,99,16

To understand the use of press releases in news coverage of pandemics, this study traces the development of framing devices from a government public health agency's press releases to news stories about the 2009 H1N1 A influenza pandemic. The communication management of the H1N1 pandemic, an international news event with local implications, by the Singapore government is a rich locus for understanding the dynamics of public relations, health communication, and journalism. A content analysis shows that the evolution of information from press release to news is marked by significant changes in media frames, including the expansion and diversification in dominant frames and emotion appeals, stronger thematic framing, more sources of information, conversion of loss frames into gain frames, and amplification of positive tone favoring the public health agency's position.

This trial was conducted to compare hemodynamic performance of a thigh-length and knee-length IPC device. The hypothesis is that thigh-length IPC will be more efficient in preventing stasis. METHODS This single-center trial tested the thigh-length sleeve (TLS) and knee-length sleeve (KLS) in 47 healthy volunteers. Peak systolic velocity and total volume flow were measured at rest and during the 11-second compression cycle. Measurements were obtained at the popliteal vein for the KLS and at the common femoral vein for the TLS. RESULTS The study was completed by 47 volunteers (32 women, 15 men), who were a mean age of 39.7 years (range, 18-68 years). There was a statistically significant difference in augmented total volume flow and peak systolic velocity between the KLS and TLS favoring the TLS: median total volume flow was 357.54 mL/min for the KLS vs 668.21 mL/min for the TLS (P < .0001), and median peak systolic velocity was 47.70 cm/s for the KLS vs 58.47 cm/s for the TLS (P = .0019). CONCLUSIONS This trial suggests that the improved hemodynamic effects of a thigh-length IPC system may provide superior thromboprophylaxis to a knee-length IPC.","Patterson, Robert B; Cardullo, Paul",Journal of vascular surgery.

The primary endpoint was time to initial treatment failure (TF), defined as HbA1c ≥7.0% at two consecutive scheduled visits after randomisation. The time to secondary TF was assessed when both groups were receiving and failing on the combination. A total of 186 (9.3%) patients had YOD and 1815 (90.7%) had LOD with a mean age difference of 20.4 years. Compared with metformin monotherapy, early combination reduced the risk of time to initial TF for both YOD (48%, p < 0.0006) and LOD (46%, p < 0.0001). With early combination, risk for time to secondary TF was reduced by 48% (p < 0.0035) in YOD and 24% (p < 0.0009) in LOD. Both treatment approaches were well-tolerated with no unexpected safety concerns. In treatment-naïve patients with YOD (HbA1c 6.5-7.5%), early combination strategy improved attainment of glycaemic target with durability and delayed treatment escalation compared with initial metformin monotherapy.

Together with supportive therapies (ventilation in particular), the suppression of the pro-inflammatory state has been a hypothesized target. Pharmacological therapies with corticosteroids and interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor antagonists have reduced mortality. The use of extracorporeal cytokine removal, also known as hemoperfusion (HP), could be a promising non-pharmacological approach to decrease the pro-inflammatory state in COVID-19. METHODS We conducted a systematic review of PubMed and EMBASE databases in order to summarize the evidence regarding HP therapy in COVID-19. We included original studies and case series enrolling at least five patients. RESULTS We included 11 articles and describe the characteristics of the populations studied from both clinical and biological perspectives. The methodological quality of the included studies was generally low. Only two studies had a control group, one of which included 101 patients in total. The remaining studies had a range between 10 and 50 patients included. There was large variability in the HP techniques implemented and in clinical and biological outcomes reported. Most studies described decreasing levels of IL-6 after HP treatment. CONCLUSION Our review does not support strong conclusions regarding the role of HP in COVID-19. Considering the very low level of clinical evidence detected, starting HP therapies in COVID-19 patients does not seem supported outside of clinical trials.

However, the learning curve for laparoscopic para-aortic lymphadenectomy is poorly reported, specifically that for the extraperitoneal approach. METHODS We examined the learning curve for laparoscopic extraperitoneal para-aortic lymphadenectomy by cumulative sum (CUSUM) analysis by retrospectively analyzing 134 patients with early-stage endometrial cancer who had undergone laparoscopic extraperitoneal para-aortic lymphadenectomy, including the first case. Data on the surgical factors that improved and were statistically correlated with the number of procedures experienced were extracted and used to create CUSUM curves. RESULTS The average time for para-aortic lymphadenectomy was 149.4 min to harvest an average of 65.3 para-aortic lymph nodes. Intra- and postoperative complications were observed in nine cases (6.7%). A switch to the transperitoneal approach was necessary in three cases (2.2%). The number of harvested para-aortic lymph nodes and the procedure time were strongly correlated with the number of procedures the patient underwent (p < 0.01). The CUSUM curve of the number of harvested para-aortic lymph nodes indicated an inflection point at the 51st case. The procedure time for para-aortic lymphadenectomy stabilized after the 59th case. CUSUM analysis of ""unexpected events,"" including intra- and postoperative complications and switch to the transperitoneal approach, showed an improved incidence at 60 cases and later.

L1 and L3 are prevalent around the rim of the Indian Ocean, the region that accounts for most of the world's new TB cases. Despite their relevance for this region, L1 and L3 remain understudied. Methods: We analyzed 2,938 L1 and 2,030 L3 whole genome sequences originating from 69 countries. We reconstructed the evolutionary history of these two lineages and identified genes under positive selection. Results: We found a strongly asymmetric pattern of migration from South Asia toward neighboring regions, highlighting the historical role of South Asia in the dispersion of L1 and L3. Moreover, we found that several genes were under positive selection, including genes involved in virulence and resistance to antibiotics. For L1 we identified signatures of local adaptation at the esxH locus, a gene coding for a secreted effector that targets the human endosomal sorting complex, and is included in several vaccine candidates.

We assessed the impact of this ship's stranding on a population of the gastropod Plicopurpura pansa. Toxic elements, hydrocarbons, shell deformities, presence of tumors, imposex, and morphological relationships were analyzed. Two years after the stranding occurred, high cyanide concentrations (0.0363 mg/l) and Ni concentrations above permissible limits (3.35 mg/l) were found in surface seawater. Hydrocarbon concentrations were high in the aft zone of the ship and decreased towards the bow area of the freighter. The P. pansa specimens collected closest to the ship structure presented a high prevalence of tumorations in the structure of the foot and morphological anomalies in the shell structure; imposex was 32% and there was evidence of effects on the growth indicator. The evidence presented here supports the existence of a significant impact from the grounding of the ship on a protected gastropod species associated with the rocky intertidal zone on the coast of Colima.

We obtained 711 OXC samples from 618 patients with epilepsy who were enrolled in the Epilepsy Registry Cohort of Seoul National University Hospital from February 2011 to January 2014. The plasma PK model was developed using a nonlinear mixed-effect modelling method with NONMEM (ver 7.3). A one-compartment model with a first-order absorption model and proportional residual error adequately described the MHD concentration-time profiles. The only covariate incorporated for CL/F and V/F was body weight. Of the 447 patients analysed, 28 (6.26%) had dose-related adverse events (DRAEs), which were dizziness, somnolence, headache, and diplopia. For DRAE occurrence, the cut-off values of the MHD trough and AUC were 12.27 mg/L (specificity 0.570, sensitivity 0.643) and 698.5 mg h/L (specificity, sensitivity 0.571), respectively. Multivariate analysis showed the sole dizziness symptom was significantly associated with both the MHD trough and the AUC (p = 0.013, p = 0.038, respectively).

The working space required for traditional stapling devices limits their use in pediatric video-assisted thoracoscopic (VATS) lung lobectomy. The use of Hem-o-lok clips (Teleflex Medical Inc. Research Triangle Park, NC) has been described for a number of applications in minimally invasive surgery and may provide an alternative to traditional stapling devices for bronchial closure. MATERIALS AND METHODS Twenty-four New Zealand White rabbits were used in the study. The hilus of each cranial lung lobe was sealed with the Endo GIA (Covidien Inc, Mansfield, MA) stapler or 2 Hem-o-lok clips and the lung lobe was removed. Lung inflation to leakage point was induced by incrementally increasing tidal volume. Side of leakage, volume at leakage, and airway pressure before leakage were recorded. RESULTS Fourteen rabbits were included in the data analysis. Leakage of air was first observed at the Hem-o-lok closure site in five rabbits and from the Endo GIA site in three rabbits. In the remaining six, both resection sites leaked simultaneously. The mean pressure before failure was 16.39 ± 7.35 mm Hg for the Hem-o-lok clips, 17.98 ± 11.12 mm Hg for the Endo GIA stapler, and 16.95 ± 3.48 mm Hg for the simultaneous failures. No statistical differences were detected in airways pressures before leakage between hilar closure devices. CONCLUSIONS Despite advances in VATS, options for bronchial closure in pediatric patients undergoing VATS lung lobectomy remain limited. Hem-o-lok clips require less working space than traditional stapling devices and may represent an equally efficacious alternative to traditional stapling devices.","Smith, Andrea L; Mayhew, Philipp D; Soares, Joao H; Kass, Philip H; Brosnan, Robert J",The Journal of surgical research,99,27

Due to its limitations, various wireless alternatives have been developed. In this prospective study, we evaluate the role of radiation-free wireless localization using the SAVI SCOUT® localization at a European centre. PATIENTS AND METHODS This technique was evaluated in a prospective cohort of 20 patients. The evaluation focused on clinical and pathological parameters in addition to patient and physician acceptance. RESULTS SAVI SCOUT reflectors (n=23) were deployed to localize 22 occult breast lesions and one axillary lymph node in 20 patients. The mean deployment duration was 5.6 min, with a mean distance from the lesion of 0.6 mm. The migration rate was 0% and the mean identification and retrieval time was 25.1 min. In patients undergoing therapeutic excision for malignancy (n=17), only one (5.9%) required reoperation for positive surgical margins. Radiologists and surgeons rated the technique as better than WGL and patient satisfaction was high. CONCLUSION Our study demonstrates that wireless localization using SAVI SCOUT® is an effective and time-efficient alternative to WGL with excellent physician and patient acceptance.","Tayeh, Salim; Muktar, Samantha; Heeney, Jennifer; Michell, Michael J; Perry, Nicholas; Suaris, Tamara; Evans, David; Malhotra, Anmol; Mokbel, Kefah",Anticancer research,99,9

Following studies over the last few decades, the concept of senescence has evolved from an antiproliferative mechanism in cancer (oncogene-induced senescence) to a critical component of physiological processes associated with embryonic development, tissue regeneration, ageing and its associated diseases. In somatic cells, oncogenic mutations in RAS-MAPK pathway genes are associated with oncogene-induced senescence and cancer, while germline mutations in the same pathway are linked to a group of monogenic developmental disorders generally termed RASopathies. Here, we consider that in these disorders, senescence induction may result in opposing outcomes, a tumour protective effect and a possible contributor to a premature ageing phenotype identified in Costello syndrome, which belongs to the RASopathy group. In this review, we will highlight the role of senescence in organismal homeostasis and we will describe the current knowledge about senescence in RASopathies. Additionally, we provide a perspective on examples of experimentally characterised RASopathy mutations that, alone or in combination with various stressors, may also trigger an age-dependent chronic senescence, possibly contributing to the age-dependent worsening of RASopathy pathophenotype and the reduction of lifespan.","Engler, Melanie; Fidan, Miray; Nandi, Sayantan; Cirstea, Ion Cristian",Mechanisms of ageing and development,99,17

We examined whether patients who had a case-averaged double low, defined as time-weighted average BIS and MAP (calculated over an entire case) below the sample mean but not in the reference group, had increased risk of the primary outcomes compared with patients whose BIS and/or MAP were at or higher than the sample mean. We also examined whether a prolonged cumulative duration of a concurrent double low (simultaneous low MAP and BIS) increased the risk of the primary outcomes. Results Case-averaged double low was not associated with increased risk of 30-day mortality {odds ratio [OR] 1.73 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.94-3.18] vs reference; P =0.01} or the composite of in-hospital mortality and morbidity [OR 1.47 (95% CI 0.98-2.20); P =0.01] after correction for multiple outcomes.

We aimed to investigate the effect of control measures and holiday seasons on the incidence and mortality rate of COVID-19 in Iran. STUDY DESIGN An observational study. METHODS The daily data of confirmed new cases and deaths in Iran were taken from the Johns Hopkins University COVID-19 database. We calculated weekly data from 19 Feb to 6 Oct 2020. To estimate the impact of control measures and holiday seasons on the incidence rate of new cases and deaths, an autoregressive hidden Markov model (ARHMM) with two hidden states fitted the data. The hidden states of the fitted model can distinguish the peak period from the non-peak period. RESULTS The control measures with a delay of one-week and two-week had a decreasing effect on the new cases in the peak and non-peak periods, respectively (P=0.005). The holiday season with a two-week delay increased the total number of new cases in the peak periods (P=0.031). The peak period for the occurrence of COVID-19 was estimated at 3 weeks. In the peak period of mortality, the control measures with a three-week delay decreased the COVID-19 mortality (P=0.010). The expected duration of staying in the peak period of mortality was around 6 weeks. CONCLUSION When an increasing trend was seen in the country, the control measures could decline the incidence and mortality related to COVID-19. Implementation of official restrictions on holiday seasons could prevent an upward trend of incidence for COVID-19 during the peak period.","Haji-Maghsoudi, Saiedeh; Sadeghifar, Majid; Roshanaei, Ghodratollah; Mahjub, Hossein",Journal of research in health sciences,99,1

This study was designed to compare the effects of conventional mechanical ventilation using a lung-protective strategy with MFV in a porcine model of lung injury. Our hypothesis was that MFV can maximize ventilation at higher frequencies without adverse consequences. We compared ventilation and hemodynamic outcomes between conventional ventilation and MFV. METHODS This was a prospective study of 6 live Yorkshire pigs (10 ± 0.5 kg). The animals were subjected to lung injury induced by saline lavage and injurious conventional mechanical ventilation. Baseline conventional pressure control continuous mandatory ventilation was applied with V(T) = 6 mL/kg and PEEP determined using a decremental PEEP trial. A manual decision support algorithm was used to implement MFV using the same conventional ventilator. We measured P(aCO2), P(aO2), end-tidal carbon dioxide, cardiac output, arterial and venous blood oxygen saturation, pulmonary and systemic vascular pressures, and lactic acid. RESULTS The MFV algorithm produced the same minute ventilation as conventional ventilation but with lower V(T) (-1 ± 0.7 mL/kg) and higher frequency (32.1 ± 6.8 vs 55.7 ± 15.8 breaths/min, P < .002). There were no differences between conventional ventilation and MFV for mean airway pressures (16.1 ± 1.3 vs 16.4 ± 2 cm H2O, P = .75) even when auto-PEEP was higher (0.6 ± 0.9 vs 2.4 ± 1.1 cm H2O, P = .02). There were no significant differences in any hemodynamic measurements, although heart rate was higher during MFV. CONCLUSIONS In this pilot study, we demonstrate that MFV allows the use of higher breathing frequencies and lower V(T) than conventional ventilation to maximize alveolar ventilation. We describe the ventilatory or hemodynamic effects of MFV. We also demonstrate that the application of a decision support algorithm to manage MFV is feasible.","Mireles-Cabodevila, Eduardo; Chatburn, Robert L; Thurman, Tracy L; Zabala, Luis M; Holt, Shirley J; Swearingen, Christopher J; Heulitt, Mark J",Respiratory care,99,31

The role of baseline frailty has not been assessed in this context. We aimed to evaluate the association between patient frailty and post-operative risk among diverse patients with cirrhosis, and to determine if frailty improves prognostication of cirrhosis surgical risk scores. METHODS This was a retrospective cohort study of U.S. Veterans with cirrhosis identified between 2008 and 2016 who underwent non-transplant major surgery. Frailty was ascertained using the Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS). Cox regression analysis was used to investigate the impact of patient frailty on post-operative mortality. Logistic regression was used to identify incremental changes in discrimination for post-operative mortality when frailty was added to risk prediction models including the MELD, MELD-Na, Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP), Mayo, and VOCAL-Penn scores. RESULTS A total 804 cirrhosis surgeries were identified. The majority of patients (48.5%) had high-risk frailty at baseline (HFRS >15). In adjusted Cox regression models, increasing frailty category was associated with poorer post-operative survival. For example, intermediate-risk frailty (HFRS 5-15) conferred a 1.77-fold increased hazard relative to low-risk frailty (HFRS <5, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.06-2.95, p=0.029). High-risk frailty demonstrated a similarly increased hazard (hazard ratio 1.74, 95% CI 1.05-2.88, p=0.032), suggesting a threshold effect of frailty on post-operative mortality. Incorporation of frailty improved discrimination of MELD, MELD-Na, and CTP for post-operative mortality, but did not do so for Mayo risk or VOCAL-Penn scores. CONCLUSION Patient frailty as an additional important predictor of cirrhosis surgical risk. Incorporation of pre-operative frailty assessments may help to risk-stratify patients, especially in settings where MELD-Na and CTP are commonly applied.","Mahmud, Nadim; Kaplan, David E; Taddei, Tamar H; Goldberg, David S",Liver transplantation : official publication of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the International Liver Transplantation Society,99,31

METHODS The authors contextualize these regulations with European and international sets of principles, in the light of the characteristics that some psychiatric disorders can present. OBJECTIVES Evaluate if such European principles need to be implemented with further specific exceptions to the obligation to stay at home for some people with mental disorders. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Prohibition to leave the house can aggravate mental disorders, resulting in the concrete risk of harmful actions, in particular in psychotic and bipolar patients, even with mild excitement, depressed patients, or in cases of delusional patients, resulting from uninterrupted cohabitation with emotionally significant family members. Even the health of subjects with anxiety pathologies, or with different forms of mental retardation can be prejudiced by forced permanence at home. From numerous provisions of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union there emerges that collective health must be balanced with individual health and with the dignity of the human person. CONCLUSIONS As the European and international provisions are hierarchically above the national provisions, the latter should be interpreted so that the non-compliance to the obligation to stay at home: a) does not constitute offence for a person tested positive to the virus, if therapeutic treatments resulting in hospitalization are deemed necessary; b) it does not constitute administrative offence if the subject proves, based on clinical and factual documented evidence, that leaving the house is necessary to avoid recrudescence of mental disorder. In addition, for evaluation purposes, particular attention should be paid to the severity of psychiatric illness in the specific case. In order to distinguish suitable subjects from those not suitable for home isolation, the reference criterion cannot be the only diagnostic element, but it will be necessary to take into account above all the severity of the condition. In the absence of such a qualitative assessment, there would be a risk of unfounded infringements of the obligation to stay at home.","Montanari Vergallo, Gianluca; Bersani, Giuseppe; Rinaldi, Raffaella",Rivista di psichiatria,99,1

The lack of a validated, rapid and simple tool for screening combined with few mental health professionals able to accurately diagnose and provide appropriate care mean that young children remain without care. Here, we present the results of the principle cross-cultural validation of the ""Psychological Screening for Young Children aged 3 to 6"" (PSYCAa3-6). The PSYCa 3-6 is a simple scale for children 3 to 6 years old administered by non-specialists, to screen young children in crises and thereby refer them to care if needed. METHODS This study was conducted in Maradi, Niger. The scale was translated into Hausa, using corroboration of independent translations. A cross-cultural validation was implemented using quantitative and qualitative methods. A random sample of 580 mothers or caregivers of children 3 to 6 years old were included. The tool was psychometrically examined and diagnostic properties were assessed comparing the PSYCa 3-6 against a clinical interview as the gold standard. RESULTS The PSYCa 3-6 Hausa version demonstrated good concurrent validity, as scores correlated with the gold standard and the Clinical Global Impression Severity Scale (CGI-S) [rho = 0.41, p-value = 0.00]. A reduction procedure was used to reduce the scale from 40 to 22 items. The test-retest reliability of the PSYCa 3-6 was found to be high (ICC 0.81, CI95% [0.68; 0.89]). In our sample, although not the purpose of this study, approximately 54 of 580 children required subsequent follow-up with a psychologist. CONCLUSIONS To our knowledge, this is the first validation of a screening scale for children 3 to 6 years old with a cross-cultural validation component, for use in humanitarian contexts. The Hausa version of the PSYCa 3-6 is a reliable and a valuable screening tool for psychological distress. Further studies to replicate our findings and additional validations of the PSYCa 3-6 in other populations may help improve the delivery of mental health care to children.","Marquer, Caroline; Barry, Caroline; Mouchenik, Yoram; Hustache, Sarah; Djibo, Douma M; Manzo, Mahamane L; Falissard, Bruno; Révah-Lévy, Anne; Grais, Rebecca F; Moro, Marie-Rose",BMC psychiatry,99,31

A total of 50 consecutive patients who had wound drainage for more than 5 days, required open wound management and had existence of culture positive infection were included the study. In this study, gauze-based NPWT was compared with conventional dressing therapy in the treatment of patients with difficult-to-heal wounds. The patients were randomly divided into two groups. Group I (n = 25) was followed by conventional antiseptic (polyhexanide solution) dressings, and group II (n = 25) was treated with saline-soaked antibacterial gauze-based NPWT. The wounds' sizes, number of debridement, bacteriology and recurrence were compared between group I and group II. The mean age of the patients was 59·50 years (range 23-97). In group I, average wound sizes of pre- and post-treatment periods were 50·60 ± 55·35 and 42·50 ± 47·92 cm(2), respectively (P < 0·001). Average duration of treatment was 25·52 ± 16·99 days, and average wound size reduction following the treatment was 19·99% in this group. In group II, the wounds displayed considerable shrinkage, accelerated granulation tissue formation, decreased and cleared away exudate. The average wound sizes in the pre- and post-treatment periods were 98·44 ± 100·88 and 72·08 ± 75·78 cm(2) , respectively (P < 0·001). Average duration of treatment was 11·96 ± 2·48 days, and average wound size reduction following the treatment was 32·34%. The patients treated with antibacterial gauze-based NPWT had a significantly reduced recurrence (2 wounds versus 14 wounds, P = 0·001), and increased number of the culture-negative cases (22 wounds versus 16 wounds, P < 0·047) in a follow-up period of 12 months. There was a statistically significant difference between two groups in all measurements. As a result, we can say that the gauze-based NPWT is a safe and effective method in the treatment of challenging infective wounds when compared with conventional wound management.","Tuncel, Umut; Erkorkmaz, Ünal; Turan, Aydın",International wound journal,99,1

METHODS A total of 15 adult domestic pigs underwent full thickness chest wall resection and reconstruction with Parietene (polypropylene composite; PTE, n = 5), Parietex (polyester composite; PTX, n = 5) or Bard (purely polypropylene, n = 5) mesh. After an observation period of 90 days all animals were sacrificed, intrathoracic adhesions classified via thoracoscopy (VATS), meshes explanted and peak peal strength required for lung/mesh separation recorded. RESULTS Adhesions assessed through VATS-exploration were strongest in the PTX-Group while PTE and BM showed comparable results. Tensiometric analyses of peak peal strength confirmed lower values in BM than for PTE and PTX. Both composite materials showed good overall bioincorporation with post-surgical perigraft-fibrosis being strongest in BM. CONCLUSION We consider composite grafts a suitable alternative for chest wall reconstruction. They are characterized by good overall biointegration and limited perigraft-fibrosis, thus potentially facilitating redo-procedures, even though a hydrophilic coating per se does not appear to prevent intrathoracic adhesion formation.","Zardo, Patrick; Zhang, Ruoyu; Freermann, Stefan; Fischer, Stefan",Annals of thoracic medicine,99,1

Using the V-Loc™ wound closure device (Covidien, New Haven, Connecticut) to suture the nasoseptal flap to the nasopharyngeal fascia, a water-tight seal was created and, along with a lumbar drain, the patient healed successfully.CSF leak after an endoscopic endonasal approach (EEA) to intradural pathologies remains one of the more common complications.1-4 Various closure techniques have been developed5-8 with success in mitigating this risk, but all have their limitations and rely on multiple layers including vascularized flaps like the nasoseptal flap.9-11 Endonasal suturing of graft materials offers the advantage of creating a water-tight seal. We present the use of the V-Loc™ wound closure device (Covidien) to successfully seal a postoperative CSF leak. The absorbable V-Loc™ wound closure device does not require the surgeon to tie knots, which is the most challenging step in a deep, 2-dimensional corridor. The suture is barbed and is anchored by threading the needle through a prefabricated loop at the end of the suture which locks in place. Each throw of the suture through tissue maintains the suture line as the barbs catch the tissue and prevent retraction. After successful closure, the needle can simply be cut off.The V-Loc™ wound closure device (Covidien) is a safe and effective adjunct to reconstruction after endoscopic endonasal skull base surgery as it provides an option for graft/flap suturing.A written release from the patient whose name or likeness is submitted as part of this Work is on file.","Zwagerman, Nathan T; Geltzeiler, Mathew N; Wang, Eric W; Fernandez-Miranda, Juan C; Snyderman, Carl H; Gardner, Paul A",Operative neurosurgery,99,1

However, the evidence base is weak. The objective of this study is to describe how selected diseases were distributed among adults with confirmed COVID-19 (COVID-19 positive tests) and among those hospitalised for COVID-19 compared to the general population. MATERIAL AND METHOD We used data from the Norwegian Patient Registry, the Norwegian Registry for Primary Health Care and the Norwegian Surveillance System for Communicable Diseases for adults from the age of 20 and older for the period 1 March 2020-13 May 2020. RESULTS Of all those who tested positive for COVID-19, 7 632 (94 %) were aged 20 years or older, and 1 025 (13.4 %) of these had been hospitalised. Among those hospitalised with COVID-19, there was a higher proportion of individuals with cardiovascular diseases (18.3 % versus 15.6 %), cancer (6.9 % versus 5.4 %), type-2 diabetes (8.6 % versus 5.2 %) and COPD (3.8 % versus 2.7 %) than in the general population as a whole after adjusting for age. The proportion of hospitalised patients with asthma, other chronic respiratory disease, cardiovascular disease, ongoing cancer treatment, complications related to hypertension, obesity and overweight, neurological disorders and cardiac and renal failure was also higher than in the general population. There were few differences between persons who had tested positive for COVID-19 and the general population in terms of underlying conditions. INTERPRETATION Among those hospitalised for COVID-19, there was a higher proportion of patients with underlying illnesses than in the general population. This may indicate that these patients tend to have a more severe course of disease or that they are more likely to be hospitalised compared to healthy individuals.

MATERIALS AND METHODS This single-institution retrospective study included 240 patients with breast cancer (mean age, 45.1 ± 2.8 years) detected by US or mammography who had undergone breast surgery between 2003 and 2008. Medical records were reviewed for clinicopathologic characteristics and detection methods. Disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were compared between patients with breast cancer in the US and mammography groups using the log-rank test. Multivariate cox regression analysis was used to identify independent variables associated with DFS and OS. RESULTS Among the 240 cases of breast cancer, 43 were detected by supplemental screening US and 197 by screening mammography (mean follow-up: 7.4 years, 93.3% with dense breasts). There were 19 recurrences and 16 deaths, all occurring in the mammography group. While the US group did not differ from the mammography group in tumor stage, the patients in this group were more likely to undergo breast-conserving surgery and radiation therapy than the mammography group. The US group also showed better DFS (p = 0.016); however, OS did not differ between the two groups (p = 0.058). In the multivariate analysis, the US group showed a lower risk of recurrence (hazard ratio, 0.097; 95% confidence interval, 0.001-0.705) compared to the mammography group. CONCLUSION Our study found that Korean females aged 40-49 years with US-detected breast cancer showed better DFS than those with mammography-detected breast cancer.

We assessed several hemodynamic variables to explore risk factors in the postoperative rupture process. MATERIALS AND METHODS We enrolled 10 patients with intracranial aneurysms, treated with flow diverters between September 2014 and December 2018, who experienced postoperative aneurysm rupture (postoperative aneurysm rupture group). We matched these subjects 1:2 with 20 patients with postoperative unruptured (postoperative unruptured group) intracranial aneurysms based on clinical and morphologic factors. Using computational fluid dynamics, we assessed hemodynamic changes pre- and posttreatment between the 2 groups on a number of qualitative and quantitative parameters. RESULTS In the postoperative aneurysm rupture group, the proportion of patients with aneurysms with an unstable flow pattern increased to 60.0% after treatment, while the proportion in the postoperative unruptured group decreased to 20.0%, a significant difference between the 2 groups (P = .028). Energy loss in the postoperative unruptured group decreased after treatment but increased in the postoperative aneurysm rupture group. The reduction ratio of energy loss showed a significant difference between the 2 groups (22.73% ± 53.59% for postoperative unruptured versus -158.81% ± 183.95% for postoperative aneurysm rupture, P = .02). Other parameters and changes of pre- and posttreatment hemodynamic parameters showed no significant difference between 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS Compared with pretreatment, unstable flow pattern and higher energy loss after Pipeline Embolization Device placement for intracranial aneurysm may be the important hemodynamic risk factors related to delayed aneurysm rupture.","Li, W; Tian, Z; Zhu, W; Zhang, Y S; Wang, K; Zhang, Y; Wang, Y; Yang, X; Liu, J",AJNR.

This disease is characterized by a vasculopathy affecting small vessels of the kidney and skin, leading to thrombotic microangiopathy. The underlying etiology remains unknown although clinicopathological and histological findings resemble features of certain forms of thrombotic microangiopathy in people, for which plasma exchange (PEX) is considered an important component of therapy. The objective of the present study is to describe the use of PEX as adjunctive treatment in dogs diagnosed with CRGV. A retrospective review of dogs diagnosed with CRGV between 2014 and 2016 treated with PEX was performed. Clinical records were reviewed and data relating to signalment, diagnostic tests and management strategies were summarized. Information and complications relating to PEX were recorded. Six dogs were diagnosed with CRGV (n = 2 ante-mortem, n = 4 post-mortem) and underwent PEX as part of their therapy. All dogs had cutaneous lesions and were azotemic with oliguria or anuria. All dogs underwent at least one PEX cycle; one dog had a single cycle PEX, three dogs two cycles PEX, and two dogs had one cycle PEX and one cycle of prolonged intermittent renal replacement treatment. Complications seen during PEX therapy included hypothermia (n = 4), tachycardia (n = 2), hypotension (n = 2), and hypocalcemia (n = 6). Two dogs survived to discharge, the remaining four dogs were euthanized. The positive outcome in two dogs treated with PEX despite the reported high mortality rate once acute kidney injury with oliguria/anuria occurs does not confirm success of this treatment. However, survival in two dogs that were initially oligoanuric highlights that further consideration and evaluation of PEX for this patient group is warranted for this specific disease. Additional studies are urgently needed to identify the underlying etiology of CRGV before more targeted therapies can be developed. Based on our findings, further evaluation of the role of PEX in this specific disease are warranted.","Skulberg, Ragnhild; Cortellini, Stefano; Chan, Daniel L; Stanzani, Giacomo; Jepson, Rosanne E",Frontiers in veterinary science,99,0

Chicks from each line were grouped into either infected or control. Following Q1 infection at day-old, fast (Line-A) and slow (Line-B) growing chicks were monitored for clinical signs and body weights. At 3, 7, 9, 14, 21 and 28 days post infection (dpi), five birds were humanely euthanised, and trachea, kidney and proventriculus tissues were collected for quantitative RT-PCR and histopathology. Blood was collected weekly to determine IBV-specific ELISA antibody titres. Q1 infection significantly reduced the body weights of Line-A chicks at 14 and 21 dpi, but there were no significant differences in Line-B. Through qRT-PCR, significantly higher viral loads were found in the trachea, proventriculus and kidney tissues of Line-A chicks at 7-9 dpi. At day-old and at 28 dpi, the mean antibody titre in Line-B was notably higher than Line-A. Significant IFN-α mRNA expression was noted in the trachea and kidneys of Line-A, whereas no change occurred in Line-B. Chicks in Line-B, compared to those in Line-A, demonstrated a tissue-dependent increase of IFN-β, TLR3, IL-1β and IL-6 and LITAF gene transcription responses to IBV Q1. It appears that the level of maternal antibodies, growth rates, and other inherent host genetic factors could have influenced the differences in viral loads and immune responses.","Manswr, Basim; Ball, Christopher; Forrester, Anne; Chantrey, Julian; Ganapathy, Kannan",Research in veterinary science,99,12

OBJECTIVE To assess accuracy of enteral feeding records, to increase nursing education and to improve nutritional documentation. METHODS An uncontrolled, prospective, pre- and post-intervention study was completed as part of a quality improvement initiative. This study was performed in a 950-bed university hospital (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) and focused in a 25-bed, closed intensive care unit (ICU) with a multidisciplinary rounding team of intensivist, nurse, pharmacist, dietitian and respiratory therapist. Nurse researchers reviewed 188 patient electronic medical records (EMR) and compared the data to volume data saved on enteral feeding pump. Data analysis revealed inconsistencies between the pump readings and EMR. The need for a prospective intervention was recognized and implementation of this intervention included pump calibration and teaching modules aimed at improving enteral feeding protocols. During post-intervention, another 234 records were reviewed. RESULTS The intervention of an education program reduced the documented discrepancy between the pump readings and charted volumes from 44 to 33%. A correlation analysis also showed a tighter relationship post-intervention (rpost = 0.84 vs. rpre = 0.76, both had a p < 0.01). CONCLUSION This study highlights the importance of accurate nutritional monitoring in the ICU and demonstrates that educational interventions can improve enteral feeding protocols. Pump calibrations, frequent interrogation and vigilant nutritional documentation can improve enteral nutrition delivery. Future studies are needed to determine if the effects are sustainable and if further education will further improve documentation and delivery.","Gonya, Susan; Baram, Michael",Hospital practice,99,17

Karyopherins comprise a family of soluble transport factors facilitating the nucleocytoplasmic translocation of proteins through the NPC. In this study, we found that karyopherin α6 (KPNA6; also known as importin α7) was required for the optimal replication of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and Zika virus (ZIKV), which are positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses replicating in the cytoplasm. The KPNA6 protein level in virus-infected cells was much higher than that in mock-infected controls, whereas the KPNA6 transcript remains stable. Viral infection blocked the ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation of KPNA6, which led to an extension of the KPNA6 half-life and the elevation of the KPNA6 level in comparison to mock-infected cells. PRRSV nsp12 protein induced KPNA6 stabilization. KPNA6 silencing was detrimental to the replication of PRRSV, and KPNA6 knockout impaired ZIKV replication. Moreover, KPNA6 knockout blocked the nuclear translocation of PRRSV nsp1β but had a minimal effect on two other PRRSV proteins with nuclear localization. Exogenous restitution of KPNA6 expression in the KPNA6-knockout cells results in restoration of the nuclear translocation of PRRSV nsp1β and the replication of ZIKV. These results indicate that KPNA6 is an important cellular factor for the replication of PRRSV and ZIKV.IMPORTANCE Positive-sense, single-stranded RNA (+ssRNA) viruses replicate in the cytoplasm of infected cells. The roles of transport factors in the nucleocytoplasmic trafficking system for the replication of +ssRNA viruses are not known. In this study, we discovered that PRRSV and ZIKV viruses needed karyopherin α6 (KPNA6), one of the transport factors, to enhance the virus replication. Our data showed that viral infection induced an elevation of the KPNA6 protein level due to an extension of the KPNA6 half-life via viral interference of the ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation of KPNA6. Notably, KPNA6 silencing or knockout dramatically reduced the replication of PRRSV and ZIKV. PRRSV nsp1β depended on KPNA6 to translocate into the nucleus. In addition, exogenous restitution of KPNA6 expression in KPNA6-knockout cells led to the restoration of nsp1β nuclear translocation and ZIKV replication. These results reveal a new aspect in the virus-cell interaction and may facilitate the development of novel antiviral therapeutics.","Yang, Liping; Wang, Rong; Yang, Shixing; Ma, Zexu; Lin, Shaoli; Nan, Yuchen; Li, Qisheng; Tang, Qiyi; Zhang, Yan-Jin",Journal of virology,99,29

METHODS PubMED/Medline, CINAHL, EMBASE, and Web of Science were searched for publications on adult patients undergoing surgery for PGS. Decannulation and need for additional surgeries were evaluated as outcomes. Linear mixed-effects (with random effects and fixed effects) models were used for multivariate testing. RESULTS In total, 516 abstracts were reviewed and 26 articles were considered for systematic review. Of these, 19 articles with 140 pooled patient cases were extracted for meta-analysis. On multivariate meta-analysis analysis accounting for study-specific variation and use of open procedures, prior surgeries were associated with additional surgeries (RR = 3.76 [1.39-3.86], P = .038) and the use of a stent was associated with a lower likelihood of decannulation (RR = 0.42 [0.09-0.98], P = .044). CONCLUSION Minimizing repeat surgery is a predictor for avoiding additional future surgeries and use of a stent was correlated with poor outcomes. These 2 findings may assist providers in patient counseling regarding the need for further surgical interventions. Further, this study is the first to compare the efficacy of surgical approaches for the resolution of PGS, and highlights the importance of avoiding repeat procedures and stents for the management of PGS.","Kremer, Candice; Jiang, Roy; Singh, Amrita; Sukys, Jordan; Brackett, Alexandria; Kohli, Nikita","The Annals of otology, rhinology, and laryngology",99,29

We investigated the characteristics and behavioral consequences of COVID-19 related OD using a large-scale study involving 3111 French respondents (78% women) to an online questionnaire over a period of 9 months covering different epidemic waves (from April 8 th 2020 to January 13 th 2021). In the patients who subjectively recovered from COVID-19 related OD (N = 609), recovery occurred on average after 16 days and most of the time within one month (""normal"" recovery range); 49 subjectively recovered in 1 to 2.5 months, and several cases took up to 6.5 months. Among the patients with ongoing OD (N = 2502), 974 were outside the ""normal"" recovery range (persistent OD) and reported OD for 1 to 10 months. Developing a persistent OD was more likely with increasing age and in women, and was more often associated with parosmia and phantosmia. The deleterious impact of COVID-19 related OD on the quality of life was significantly aggravated by OD duration, and was more pronounced in women. Because persistent OD is not infrequent after COVID-19, has deleterious consequences on the quality of life, and receives few solutions from the health practitioners, it would be beneficial to implement screening and treatment programs to minimize the long-term behavioral consequences of COVID-19 related OD.","Ferdenzi, Camille; Bousquet, Christophe; Aguera, Pierre-Emmanuel; Dantec, Morgane; Daudé, Christelle; Fornoni, Lesly; Fournel, Arnaud; Kassan, Aurélien; Mantel, Marylou; Moranges, Maëlle; Moussy, Erwan; Richard Ortegón, Stéphane; Rouby, Catherine; Bensafi, Moustafa",Chemical senses,99,1

OBJECTIVE We sought to assess food allergy phenotypes in a genetically diverse collection of mice. METHODS We selected 16 Collaborative Cross (CC) mouse strains, as well as the classic inbred C57BL/6J, C3H/HeJ, and BALB/cJ strains, for screening. Female mice were sensitized to peanut intragastrically with or without cholera toxin and then challenged with peanut by means of oral gavage or intraperitoneal injection and assessed for anaphylaxis. Peanut-specific immunoglobulins, T-cell cytokines, regulatory T cells, mast cells, and basophils were quantified. RESULTS Eleven of the 16 CC strains had allergic reactions to intraperitoneal peanut challenge, whereas only CC027/GeniUnc mice reproducibly experienced severe symptoms after oral food challenge (OFC). CC027/GeniUnc, C3H/HeJ, and C57BL/6J mice all mounted a TH2 response against peanut, leading to production of IL-4 and IgE, but only the CC027/GeniUnc mice reacted to OFC. Orally induced anaphylaxis in CC027/GeniUnc mice was correlated with serum levels of Ara h 2 in circulation but not with allergen-specific IgE or mucosal mast cell protease 1 levels, indicating systemic allergen absorption is important for anaphylaxis through the gastrointestinal tract. Furthermore, CC027/GeniUnc, but not C3H/HeJ or BALB/cJ, mice can be sensitized in the absence of cholera toxin and react on OFC to peanut. CONCLUSIONS We have identified and characterized CC027/GeniUnc mice as a strain that is genetically susceptible to peanut allergy and prone to severe reactions after OFC. More broadly, these findings demonstrate the untapped potential of the CC population in developing novel models for allergy research.","Orgel, Kelly; Smeekens, Johanna M; Ye, Ping; Fotsch, Lauren; Guo, Rishu; Miller, Darla R; Pardo-Manuel de Villena, Fernando; Burks, A Wesley; Ferris, Martin T; Kulis, Michael D",The Journal of allergy and clinical immunology,99,1

The aim of this study was to assess the co-incidence of cirrhosis, alcohol abuse, hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and fatty liver disease in patients in the population of north-eastern Poland, to analyse the usefulness of α-fetoprotein (AFP) in the diagnosis of HCC and to assess the effectiveness of HCC treatment in this group. Material and methods The study involved 104 patients diagnosed with HCC. The age, sex, comorbidities, HCC risk factors and levels of AFP were analysed. The effect of antiviral therapy of HCV and HBV on HCC development was observed and the effectiveness of therapies used in the treatment of HCC was assessed. Results Over 90% of patients with HCC were older than 45 years. The incidence of HCC was higher in men than in women. Patients with HCC were also diagnosed with cirrhosis (72%), alcohol abuse (35%), HCV infection (35%), HBV infection (24%), and fatty liver disease (13%). HCC developed in 9/25 (36%) patients positive for HBV despite effective antiviral therapy. The highest AFP levels were found in HBV-positive patients. The mean survival time was 19 months for partial hepatectomy and 16 months for thermal ablation. Conclusions The main predisposing factor for HCC is cirrhosis, followed by alcohol abuse and infection with HCV. Effective antiviral therapy for HBV does not prevent the development of HCC in all cases. Since 29% of patients were disqualified from HCC treatment due to an advanced stage of cancer, it indicates insufficient screening for HCC. Partial hepatectomy and radiofrequency ablation show comparable effectiveness in the treatment of HCC.","Łapiński, Tadeusz Wojciech; Tarasik, Aleksandr; Januszkiewicz, Marcin; Flisiak, Robert",Clinical and experimental hepatology,99,12

They selectively interfere with the growth of other bacteria. The production and secretion of bacteriocins confer a distinct ecological advantage to the producer in competing against other bacteria that are present in the same ecological niche. Streptococcus mutans, a significant contributor to the development of dental caries, is one of the most prolific producer of bacteriocins, known as mutacins in S. mutans In this study, we characterized the locus encoding mutacin B-Ny266, a lantibiotic with a broad-spectrum of activity. The chromosomal locus is composed of six predicted operon structures encoding proteins involved in regulation, antimicrobial activity, biosynthesis, modification, transport, and immunity. Mutacin B-Ny266 was purified from semi-solid cultures and two inhibitory peptides, LanA and LanA', were detected. Both peptides were highly modified. Such modifications include dehydration of serine and threonine, and the formation of a C-terminal aminovinyl-cysteine (AviCys) ring. While LanA peptide alone is absolutely required for antimicrobial activity, the presence of LanA' enhanced the activity of LanA, suggesting that B-Ny266 may function as a two-peptide lantibiotic. The activation of lanAA' expression is most likely controlled by the conserved two-component system NsrRS that is activated by LanA peptide but not LanA'. The chromosomal locus encoding mutacin B-Ny266 was not universally conserved in all sequenced S. mutans genomes. Intriguingly, the genes encoding LanAA' peptides were restricted to the most invasive serotypes of S. mutans IMPORTANCE Although dental caries is largely preventable, it remains the most common and costly infectious diseases worldwide. Caries is initiated by the presence of dental plaque biofilm that contains Streptococcus mutans, a species extensively characterized for its role in caries development and formation. S. mutans deploys an arsenal of strategies to establish itself within the oral cavity. One of them is the production of bacteriocins that confer a competitive advantage by targeting and killing closely related competitors. In this work, we found that mutacin B-Ny266 is a potent lantibiotic effective at killing a wide-array of oral streptococci, including nearly all S. mutans strains tested. Lantibiotics produced by oral bacteria could represent a promising strategy to target caries pathogens embedded in dental plaque biofilm.","Dufour, Delphine; Barbour, Abdelahhad; Chan, Yuki; Cheng, Marcus; Rahman, Taimoor; Thorburn, Matthew; Stewart, Cameron; Finer, Yoav; Gong, Siew-Ging; Lévesque, Céline M",Journal of bacteriology,99,27

Open-ended questions were included to study people's feelings about COVID-19, and content analysis was subsequently conducted. In terms of results, it is revealed that the population surveyed feels uncertainty, fear and anguish, albeit a feeling of responsibility and care in the face of COVID-19 also emerges. Moreover, positive feelings regarding society stand out as an achievement of social interdependence. The results obtained show that the impact on mental health differs in accordance with gender, educational level, and perceived comfort in the home. The study concludes that the emotional and bonding dimensions of people are central to confronting the COVID-19 pandemic in Argentina. It is recommended that these dimensions, as well as their subjective and differential social impact among the different population groups, should be considered in the planning of policies to address the COVID-19 pandemic.","Johnson, María Cecilia; Saletti-Cuesta, Lorena; Tumas, Natalia",Ciencia & saude coletiva,99,5

In order to obtain a novel permeability cancer imaging agent based on 99mTc-labeled liposomes, we describe microwave-assisted synthesis of stearyl 6-(benzylidenehydrazinyl) nicotinamide lipid, which was included in two formulations: nanometric hydrazinonicotinic acid (HYNIC) liposome and its PEGylated coated analogue, HYNIC-PEG liposome. Radiolabeling with 99mTc via stearyl 6-(benzylidenehydrazinyl) nicotinamide was found to be easy, reproducible, and stable, revealing high radiochemical purity (94 ± 1.7%) for both liposomal formulations. Biodistribution at 4 h and 24 h and scintigraphic images at 4 h were performed in normal and melanoma-bearing C57BL/6 mice. Biodistribution studies at 4 h showed tumor uptake of 99mTc-HYNIC liposome and 99mTc-HYNIC-PEG liposome (1.1 ± 0.6 and 2.5 ± 0.4, respectively) and also at 24 h p.i.

Initially, VLPs were primarily derived from non-enveloped icosahedral or helical viruses and proved to be viable vaccine candidates due to their effective presentation of epitopes in a native conformation. VLP technology has also been used to prepare chimeric VLPs decorated with genetically fused or chemically coupled epitope stretches selected from immunologically defined target proteins. However, structural constraints associated with the rigid geometrical architecture of icosahedral or helical VLPs pose challenges for the expression and presentation of large epitopes. Complex VLPs derived from non-symmetric enveloped viruses are increasingly being used to incorporate large epitopes and even full-length foreign proteins. Pleomorphic VLPs derived from influenza or other enveloped viruses can accommodate multiple full-length and/or chimeric proteins that can be rationally designed for multifunctional purposes, including multivalent vaccines. Therefore, a second generation of VLP carriers is represented by complex particles reconstructed from natural or chimeric structural proteins derived from complex enveloped viruses. Further development of safe and efficient VLP nanotechnology may require a rational combination of both approaches.","Pushko, Peter; Pumpens, Paul; Grens, Elmars",Intervirology,99,1

However, in trans-oral surgical approaches anatomical deformation due to instrumentation, specifically placement of laryngoscopes and retractors, present a significant challenge for surgeons relying on preoperative imaging to resect tumors to negative margins. Quantifying the deformation due to instrumentation is needed in order to develop predictive models of operative deformation. In order to study this deformation, we used a CT/MR-compatible laryngoscopy system in concert with intraoperative CT imaging. 3D models of preoperative and intraoperative anatomy were generated. Mandible and hyoid displacements as well as tongue deformations were quantified for eight patients undergoing diagnostic laryngoscopy. Across patients, we found on average 1.3 cm of displacement for these anatomic structures due to laryngoscope insertion. On average, the maximum displacement for certain tongue regions exceeded 4 cm. The anatomical deformations quantified here can serve as a reference for describing how the upper aerodigestive tract anatomy changes during instrumentation and may be helpful in developing predictive models of intraoperative upper aerodigestive tract deformation.","Wu, Xiaotian; Paydarfar, Joseph A; Halter, Ryan J",Annals of biomedical engineering,99,1

We also identified potential new NANDA-I nursing diagnoses, NOC outcomes, and NIC interventions for future development related to nurses' role during a pandemic. METHODS Using a consensus process, seven nurse experts created the linkages for individuals during the COVID 19 pandemic using the following steps: (a) creating an initial list of potential nursing diagnoses, (b) selecting and categorizing outcomes that aligned with all components of each nursing diagnosis selected, and (c) identifying relevant nursing interventions. FINDINGS A total of 16 NANDA-I nursing diagnoses were identified as the foundation for the linkage work, organized in two dimensions, physiological and psychosocial. A total of 171 different NOC outcomes were identified to guide care based on the nursing diagnoses and 96 NIC interventions were identified as suggested interventions. A total of 13 proposed concepts were identified for potential future development across the three classifications. CONCLUSIONS The linkages of nursing diagnoses, outcomes, and interventions developed in this article provide a guide to enhance nursing practice and determine the effectiveness of nurses' contribution to patient outcomes for individuals at risk for or infected by COVID-19. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE NANDA-I, NOC, and NIC linkages identified in this paper are an important example of the value of using standardized nursing terminologies to guide and document nursing care. When included in electronic health record databases and used widely, the data generated from the care plans can be used to create new knowledge about how to better improve outcomes for patients with COVID-19.","Swanson, Elizabeth; Mantovani, Vanessa Monteiro; Wagner, Cheryl; Moorhead, Sue; Lopez, Karen Dunn; Macieira, Tamara Gonçalves Rezende; Abe, Noriko",International journal of nursing knowledge,99,30

Previous preclinical and clinical studies with HSP90i have demonstrated activity in EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This study sought to determine the safety and tolerability of onalespib plus erlotinib in EGFR-mutant NSCLC and to evaluate the preliminary efficacy of the combination in epidermal growth factor receptor exon 20 insertion (EGFRex20ins) NSCLC. PATIENTS AND METHODS Standard 3+3 dose escalation was followed by a phase II expansion in EGFRex20ins. The phase II component targeted a response rate of 25% versus a background rate of 5%. Prospective next-generation sequencing (NGS) of 70 cancer-related genes, including EGFR, via plasma circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) was performed. Toxicity was graded by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4, and response was determined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) 1.1. RESULTS Eleven patients were treated (nine dose escalation, two dose expansion). Two dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) occurred in dose level (DL) 0 and zero in DL -1 (minus). In 10 EGFRex20ins patients, no responses were observed, median progression-free survival was 5.4 months (95% confidence interval, 0.9-5.7), and the disease control rate (DCR) was 40% (median, 3.5 months). EGFRex20ins was detected in nine of 10 ctDNA samples at baseline; on-treatment ctDNA clearance was not observed. Grade 3 diarrhea was the predominant toxicity in 45% of patients. The recommended phase II dose is DL -1 (minus): erlotinib 150 mg orally every morning and onalespib 120 mg/m2 intravenously on days 1, 8, and 15 every 28 days. CONCLUSION Overlapping toxicities of erlotinib and onalespib, mainly diarrhea, limited the tolerability of this combination, and limited clinical activity was observed, so the trial was closed early. Plasma EGFRex20ins ctDNA was detected in the majority of patients; failure to clear ctDNA was consistent with lack of tumor response (NCT02535338).","Riess, Jonathan W; Reckamp, Karen L; Frankel, Paul; Longmate, Jeffrey; Kelly, Karen A; Gandara, David R; Weipert, Caroline M; Raymond, Victoria M; Keer, Harold N; Mack, Philip C; Newman, Edward M; Lara, Primo N",Clinical lung cancer,99,1

The role of novel iron therapies to treat anaemia is increasing. This systematic review and meta-analysis assesses the efficacy and safety of iron therapies for the treatment of adults with anaemia. METHODS AND RESULTS Electronic databases and search engines were searched as per Cochrane methodology. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of iron vs. inactive control or placebo, as well as alternative formulations, doses, and routes in anaemic adults without chronic kidney disease or in the peri-partum period were eligible. The primary outcome of interest was mortality at 1 year. Secondary outcomes were blood transfusion, haemoglobin levels, quality of life, serious adverse events, and length of hospital stay. A total of 64 RCTs (including five studies of heart failure patients) comprising 9004 participants were included. None of the studies was at a low risk of bias. There were no statistically significant differences in mortality between iron and inactive control. Both oral and parenteral iron significantly reduced the proportion of patients requiring blood transfusion compared with inactive control [risk ratio (RR) 0.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.48-0.90; and RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.73-0.97, respectively]. Haemoglobin was increased more by both oral and parenteral iron compared with inactive control [mean difference (MD) 0.91 g/dL, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.35; and MD 1.04, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.57, respectively], and parenteral iron demonstrated a greater increase when compared with oral iron (MD 0.53 g/dL, 95% CI 0.31-0.75). In all comparisons, there were no differences in the results comparing patients with and without heart failure.

An arteriovenous fistula (AVF), considered the optimal access for HD, rather than a graft or central venous catheter (CVC) caused the ""Fistula First"" initiative to dominate quality assessment. However, this initiative had the unintended consequence of increasing the proportion of less desirable catheters, leading to ""Fistula First, Catheter Last"". But as the end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) population expanded with aging, sicker patients, individual assessment of the appropriate access changed the paradigm to KDOQI's ""Patient First: ESKD Life-Plan"" to attain the ""right access, in the right patient, at the right time, for the right reasons"". However, such a goal has proved elusive because the optimal vascular access does not currently exist. Thus, ESKD care providers attempting to offer the ""right access"" must weigh the barriers to achieving the most optimal access to suit each of their HD patients. The barriers are based on shortcomings related specifically to each of the three vascular accesses and to characteristics of each ESKD patient's demographics, physical factors, quality of life, and cost considerations. This article will describe these barriers so that clinicians caring for ESKD patients initiating or receiving HD provide the most optimal vascular access for that specific patient.","Brown, Robert S",Seminars in dialysis,99,1

METHODS We performed a secondary analysis of the Determinants of Oral Corticosteroid Responsiveness in Wheezing Asthmatic Youth (DOORWAY) study, a prospective cohort study of children (aged 1-17 years) presenting to the emergency department with moderate or severe exacerbations. Nasopharyngeal specimens were analyzed by RT-PCR for 27 respiratory pathogens. We investigated the association between pathogens and both exacerbation severity (assessed with the Pediatric Respiratory Assessment Measure) and treatment failure (hospital admission, emergency department stay >8 hours, or relapse) of a standardized severity-specific treatment. Logistic multivariate regressions were used to estimate average marginal effects (absolute risks and risk differences [RD]). RESULTS Of 958 participants, 61.7% were positive for ≥1 pathogen (rhinovirus was the most prevalent [29.4%]) and 16.9% experienced treatment failure. The presence of any pathogen was not associated with higher baseline severity but with a higher risk of treatment failure (20.7% vs 12.5%; RD = 8.2% [95% confidence interval: 3.3% to 13.1%]) compared to the absence of a pathogen. Nonrhinovirus pathogens were associated with an increased absolute risk (RD) of treatment failure by 13.1% (95% confidence interval: 6.4% to 19.8%), specifically, by 8.8% for respiratory syncytial virus, 24.9% for influenza, and 34.1% for parainfluenza. CONCLUSIONS Although respiratory pathogens were not associated with higher severity on presentation, they were associated with increased treatment failure risk, particularly in the presence of respiratory syncytial virus, influenza, and parainfluenza. This supports influenza prevention in asthmatic children, consideration of pathogen identification on presentation, and exploration of treatment intensification for infected patients at higher risk of treatment failure.","Merckx, Joanna; Ducharme, Francine M; Martineau, Christine; Zemek, Roger; Gravel, Jocelyn; Chalut, Dominic; Poonai, Naveen; Quach, Caroline",Pediatrics,99,26

The diagnosis was confirmed with transvaginal ultrasound, and all of the patients underwent laparoscopic management. RESULTS A diagnosis of CSP or CP was confirmed in all of the patients during the laparoscopic procedure. None of the patients required conversion to laparotomy. The total operative time ranged from 40 minutes to 120 minutes. The total blood loss was limited, ranging from 30 mL to 200 mL. All of the women tolerated the operation well and had uneventful recoveries.

We investigated whether additional treatment with dexmedetomidine or lidocaine could reduce opioid consumption. METHODS We randomized 59 study participants into three groups and examined: (i) fentanyl consumption, (ii) consumption of piritramide, and (iii) cognitive function and neuropathic pain. The control group received continuous propofol infusion and fentanyl boluses. Continuous intravenous infusion of dexmedetomidine (0.5 µg/kg/h) was administered to the dexmedetomidine group and lidocaine (1.5 mg/kg/h) was administered to the lidocaine group. RESULTS No reduction in fentanyl consumption was observed among the groups. However, we noted a significantly lower consumption of piritramide on the first and second postoperative day in the lidocaine group. Total consumption of piritramide was significantly lower in the lidocaine group compared with the control group. CONCLUSIONS Lidocaine and dexmedetomidine reduced intraoperative propofol consumption, while lidocaine reduced postoperative piritramide consumption.

METHODS Constant, intermittent, and stepping-down SD strategies were modeled at 4 mean magnitudes (5%, 10 %, 15 % and 20 %), 2 time windows (40-days, 80-days), and 2 levels of personal caution (30 % and 50 %). RESULTS The stepping-down strategy was the best long-term SD strategy to minimize the peak number of active COVID-19 cases and associated deaths. The stepping-down strategy also resulted in a reduction in total time required to SD over a two-year period by 6.5 % compared to an intermittent or constant SD strategy. An 80-day SD time-window was statistically more effective in maintaining control over the COVID-19 pandemic than a 40-day window. However, the results were dependent upon 50 % of people being cautious (engaging in personal protection measures). CONCLUSION If people exercise caution while in public by protecting themselves (e.g., wearing a facemask, proper hand hygiene and avoid agglomeration) the magnitude and duration of SD necessary to maintain control over the pandemic can be reduced. Our models suggest that the most effective way to reduce SD over a two-year period is a stepping-down approach every 80 days. According to our model, this method would prevent a second peak and the number of intensive care units needed per day would be within the threshold of those currently available.","Kennedy, Deanna M; Zambrano, Gustavo José; Wang, Yiyu; Neto, Osmar Pinto",Journal of clinical virology : the official publication of the Pan American Society for Clinical Virology,99,1

There is evidence that N-3 supplementation may benefit exercise performance, however, no study has investigated the ergogenic potential of N-3 supplementation. Our objective was to determine the effect of short-term N-3 supplementation on neuromuscular-function and physical-performance in well-trained athletes. METHODS Male athletes (n = 30), 25 years (SD 4.6), training 17 h(.)wk(-1) (SD 5) completed this randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-design study. At baseline a blood sample was collected, maximal voluntary isometric contractions (MVC) with electromyography (EMG) recordings were measured, and participants underwent various performance tests including a Wingate test and 250 kJ time trial (TT) followed by repeated MVC and EMG measurement. Participants were then randomly assigned to receive N-3 (5 ml seal oil, 375 mg EPA, 230 mg DPA, 510 mg DHA) or placebo (5 ml olive oil) for 21-days after which baseline testing was repeated. The magnitude-based inference approach was used to estimate the probability that N-3 had a beneficial effect on neuromuscular-function and performance of at least ±1%. Data are shown as mean ± 90% confidence-interval. RESULTS Plasma EPA was higher on N-3 than placebo (p = 0.004) but the increases in DPA and DHA were not significant (p = 0.087, p = 0.058). N-3 supplementation had an unclear effect on MVC force (4.1 ± 6.6%) but increased vastus lateralis EMG by 20 ± 18% vs placebo (very likely beneficial). N-3 supplementation reduced Wingate percent power drop by 4.76 ± 3.4 % vs placebo (very likely beneficial), but the difference in TT performance was unclear (-1.9 ± 4.8%).

Despite rigorous evidence of their safety and efficacy in well-controlled trials, a number of key factors concerning their use remain poorly defined. Among these, none has received more attention to date than the debate on how many devices are optimally required to achieve a safe, effective, and economical outcome. Additional, related questions concern device sizing relative to the parent artery and optimal method of deployment of the devices. While some or all of these issues may be ultimately answered on an empiric basis via subgroup analysis of growing treatment cohorts, we believe that careful in vitro examination of relevant device properties can also help guide its in vivo use. MATERIALS AND METHODS We conducted a number of benchtop experiments to investigate the varied porosity of Pipeline Embolization Devices deployed in a simulated range of parent vessel diameters and applied these results toward conceptualizing optimal treatment strategies of fusiform and wide-neck aneurysms. RESULTS The results of our studies confirm a predictable parabolic variability in device porosity based on the respective comparative sizes of the device and recipient artery, as well as device curvature. Even modest oversizing leads to a significant increase in porosity. CONCLUSIONS The experiments demonstrate various deleterious effects of device oversizing relative to the parent artery and provide strategies for addressing size mismatches when they are unavoidable.","Shapiro, M; Raz, E; Becske, T; Nelson, P K",AJNR.

Convenience sample surveys indicate that recovery began soon after. Using a probability sample, we tracked mental health during the pandemic to characterise mental health trajectories and identify predictors of deterioration. METHODS This study was a secondary analysis of five waves of the UK Household Longitudinal Study (a large, national, probability-based survey that has been collecting data continuously since January, 2009) from late April to early October, 2020 and pre-pandemic data taken from 2018-19. Mental health was assessed using the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). We used latent class mixed models to identify discrete mental health trajectories and fixed-effects regression to identify predictors of change in mental health. FINDINGS Mental health was assessed in 19 763 adults (≥16 years; 11 477 [58·1%] women and 8287 [41·9%] men; 3453 [17·5%] participants from minority ethnic groups). Mean population mental health deteriorated with the onset of the pandemic and did not begin improving until July, 2020. Latent class analysis identified five distinct mental health trajectories up to October 2020. Most individuals in the population had either consistently good (7437 [39·3%] participants) or consistently very good (7623 [37·5%] participants) mental health across the first 6 months of the pandemic. A recovering group (1727 [12·0%] participants) showed worsened mental health during the initial shock of the pandemic and then returned to around pre-pandemic levels of mental health by October, 2020. The two remaining groups were characterised by poor mental health throughout the observation period; for one group, (523 [4·1%] participants) there was an initial worsening in mental health that was sustained with highly elevated scores. The other group (1011 [7·0%] participants) had little initial acute deterioration in their mental health, but reported a steady and sustained decline in mental health over time. These last two groups were more likely to have pre-existing mental or physical ill-health, to live in deprived neighbourhoods, and be of Asian, Black or mixed ethnicity. Infection with SARS-CoV-2, local lockdown, and financial difficulties all predicted a subsequent deterioration in mental health. INTERPRETATION Between April and October 2020, the mental health of most UK adults remained resilient or returned to pre-pandemic levels. Around one in nine individuals had deteriorating or consistently poor mental health. People living in areas affected by lockdown, struggling financially, with pre-existing conditions, or infection with SARS-CoV-2 might benefit most from early intervention.

We aim to determine if CTP profiles can predict ICAD in LVOS. Methods Retrospective review of a prospectively collected interventional stroke database from September 2010 to March 2015. Patients with intracranial ICA/MCA-M1/M2 occlusions and CTP were dichotomized into ICAD versus non-ICAD etiologies. Ischemic core (relative cerebral blood flow < 30%) and hypoperfusion volumes were estimated by automated CTP. Results A total of 250 patients met the inclusion criteria, comprised of 21 (8%) ICAD and 229 non-ICAD etiologies. Baseline characteristics were similar between groups, except for higher HbA1c levels (p < 0.01), LDL cholesterol (p < 0.01), systolic blood pressure (p < 0.01), and lower rate of atrial fibrillation (p < 0.01) in ICAD patients. There were no significant differences in volumes of baseline ischemic core (p = 0.54) among groups. ICAD patients had smaller Tmax > 4 s, Tmax > 6 s, and Tmax > 10 s absolute lesions, and a higher ratio of Tmax > 4 s/Tmax > 6 s volumes (median 2 [1.6-2.3] vs. 1.6 [1.4-2.0]; p = 0.02). A Tmax > 4 s/Tmax > 6 s ratio ≥2 showed specificity = 73%/sensitivity = 52% for ICAD and was observed in 47.6% of ICAD versus 26.1% of non-ICAD patients (p = 0.07). Clinical outcomes were comparable amongst groups.

This study assessed airborne concentrations and time profiles of total volatile organic compounds (TVOC) and chlorine generated during typical bathroom cleaning performed by aides using conventional and green products. Aides performed cleaning tasks in a simulated residential bathroom constructed in an environmental air sampling laboratory. A balanced experimental design involved each aide coming to the lab for four visits during which she performed two 20-min cleaning sessions using one of three C&D products (bleach-based, 1-5% sodium hypochlorite by weight; quats-based, 0.1-1% by weight quaternary ammonium compounds; and ""green,"" 0.05% by weight thymol, a component of botanical thyme oil) or distilled water as a control. TVOC and chlorine direct reading instruments were attached to aides with sample inlets located in the breathing zone. Ten-second averages of TVOC and chlorine gas concentrations and instantaneous peak concentrations were recorded for the sessions' duration. TVOC concentrations by methods of C&D application (spraying, streaming, wiping) also were evaluated. The study completed 169 air sampling sessions with 22 aides. The quats-based product generated more than twice the average TVOC concentrations (mean = 1,210 ppb) than the bleach-based (mean = 593 ppb) or green (mean = 498 ppb) products. Each product generated TVOC concentrations that rose rapidly within the first few minutes of application. Spraying produced the highest TVOC exposures, wiping the lowest. Thirteen aides (65%) experienced peak chlorine exposures above the OSHA PEL ceiling limit (1 ppm) when using the bleach-based product. HC aides may experience respiratory hazards from use of conventional or green C&D products formulated with bleach or other respiratory irritants and sprayed in small, poorly ventilated spaces typical of bathrooms.

The regulated assembly and disassembly of motor-adaptor complexes ensures that cargoes are loaded at their origin and unloaded at their destination. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, early in the cell cycle, a portion of the vacuole is transported into the emerging bud. This transport requires a myosin V motor, Myo2, which attaches to the vacuole via Vac17, the vacuole-specific adaptor protein. Vac17 also binds to Vac8, a vacuolar membrane protein. Once the vacuole is brought to the bud cortex via the Myo2-Vac17-Vac8 complex, Vac17 is degraded and the vacuole is released from Myo2. However, mechanisms governing dissociation of the Myo2-Vac17-Vac8 complex are not well understood. Ubiquitylation of the Vac17 adaptor at the bud cortex provides spatial regulation of vacuole release. Here, we report that ubiquitylation alone is not sufficient for cargo release. We find that a parallel pathway, which initiates on the vacuole, converges with ubiquitylation to release the vacuole from Myo2. Specifically, we show that Yck3 and Vps41, independent of their known roles in homotypic fusion and protein sorting (HOPS)-mediated vesicle tethering, are required for the phosphorylation of Vac17 in its Myo2 binding domain. These phosphorylation events allow ubiquitylated Vac17 to be released from Myo2 and Vac8. Our data suggest that Vps41 is regulating the phosphorylation of Vac17 via Yck3, a casein kinase I, and likely another unknown kinase. That parallel pathways are required to release the vacuole from Myo2 suggests that multiple signals are integrated to terminate organelle inheritance.","Wong, Sara; Hepowit, Nathaniel L; Port, Sarah A; Yau, Richard G; Peng, Yutian; Azad, Nadia; Habib, Alim; Harpaz, Nofar; Schuldiner, Maya; Hughson, Frederick M; MacGurn, Jason A; Weisman, Lois S",Current biology : CB,99,1

Most of the CPR was performed in supine, only 5% was done in prone position. 54.6% of participants had not taken any course of Advance Life Support (ALS) in the last 2 years. 97.7% of respondents think that Anesthesia should lead the in-hospital CPR. Conclusion The specialty of Anesthesiology has actively participated in the care of the critically ill patient and in the management of CPR during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, training and/or updating in ALS is required.","Aliaño Piña, M; Ruiz, C; Monedero, P; Galán, J",Revista espanola de anestesiologia y reanimacion,99,9

PATIENTS AND METHOD Over a period of 10 years we performed 132 LLRs in 129 patients: 112 malignant tumours (90 hepatic metastases; 22 primary malignant tumours) and 20 benign lesions (18 benign tumours; 2 hydatid cysts). Twenty-eight cases received TLS and 104 had HAS. SURGICAL TECHNIQUE 6 right hepatectomies (2 as the second stage of a two-stage liver resection); 6 left hepatectomies; 9 resections of 3 segments; 42 resections of 2 segments; 64 resections of one segment; and 5 cases of local resections. RESULTS There was no perioperative mortality, and morbidity was 3%. With TLS the resection was completed in 23/28 cases, whereas with HAS it was completed in all 104 cases. Transfusion: 4,5%; operating time: 150min; and mean length of stay: 3,5 days. The 1-, 3- and 5-year survival rates for the primary malignant tumours were 100, 86 and 62%, and for colorectal metastases 92, 82 and 52%, respectively. CONCLUSION LLR via both TLS and HAS in selected cases are similar to the results of open surgery (similar 5-year morbidity, mortality and survival rates) but with the advantages of minimally invasive surgery.","Robles Campos, Ricardo; Marín Hernández, Caridad; Lopez-Conesa, Asunción; Olivares Ripoll, Vicente; Paredes Quiles, Miriam; Parrilla Paricio, Pascual",Cirugia espanola,99,13

The effect of temperature and lighting on 49 cellular or microbial antigens was evaluated in 4 serial paraffin sections, cut 12 months, 10 months, 8 months, 5 months, 3 months, 1 month, 3 days, and 1 day before immunohistochemistry. Slides were stored at room temperature (RT) in the dark, at 4°C in the dark, at RT under fluorescent light, or at RT with windowpane exposure to sunlight. Immunohistochemistry was performed simultaneously in an automated immunostainer. Immunoreactivity was compared with that in the corresponding 1-day-old section and scored as 4 (<10% reduction), 3 (10%-25% reduction), 2 (26%-60% reduction), 1(>60% reduction), or 0 (no reactivity). Any loss of immunoreactivity was proportional to the tissue section age and was least in sections stored in the dark. Immunoreactivity was only completely lost in light-exposed sections and as early as 1 month for CD45. Other markers with complete loss of immunoreactivity were bovine viral diarrhea virus, CD18 (only with fluorescent light), CD31, CD68, canine parvovirus, chromogranins, and thyroid transcription factor-1. Markers with complete loss after light exposure also had reduced immunoreactivity when stored in the dark, as early as day 3. Eight markers (Bartonella spp, CD11d, high molecular weight cytokeratins, feline coronavirus, GATA-4, insulin, p63, progesterone receptor) had minimal decrease in immunoreactivity, regardless of treatment. In conclusion, light-induced antigen decay (tissue section aging) is antigen dependent and could explain unexpectedly weak or negative immunohistochemical reactions in stored paraffin sections.","Ramos-Vara, J A; Webster, J D; DuSold, D; Miller, M A",Veterinary pathology,99,19

Therefore, the medical records of all bitches that were spayed using a laparoscopic single port ovariectomy with an operating laparoscope between November 2007 and November 2014 were reviewed. A minimum follow-up period of 12 months was required for study inclusion. One hundred and thirty two adult, healthy, femal dogs were included in our study. The information collected included breed, bodyweight, age at ovariectomy and postoperative complications detected during follow-up 9-14 days after surgery. Furthermore, an electronic questionnaire was implemented, and the owners of the dogs were asked to report on long-term complications and to retrospectively evaluate postoperative pain and overall satisfaction. Sixty-two different and mixed breed dogs with weights ranging from 1.9 to 50 kg and ages ranging from 0.5 to 10.8 years were included. Short-term complications were detected in 21 out of 132 cases, mostly at the surgical site (15.9 per cent). According to our questionnaire (n=65), 10 dogs developed urinary incontinence categorised as a major complication (15.4 per cent). The owner's evaluated pain score was less than 300 on a 1000-unit visual analogue scale for 56 out of 65 dogs (86.2 per cent) and less than 500 in 63 dogs (96.9 per cent). The dog owners' satisfaction rate was 95.3 per cent (87.5 per cent evaluated the surgery as excellent and 7.8 per cent as good). Altogether, our study suggests that single port access using an operating laparoscope for ovariectomy has minor complication rates comparable to other laparoscopic techniques but has the advantages of a low postoperative pain level as evaluated by the owner and a very high owner's satisfaction rate.","Binder, Claudia; Katić, Nikola; Aurich, Jörg E; Dupré, Gilles",The Veterinary record,99,1

It describes how telerehabilitation can be leveraged to fill in the gaps in service, training, and research arms of the physical medicine and rehabilitation specialty. The ITAWAG (""to call"") telerehabilitation program is the response of the Department of Rehabilitation Medicine at Philippine General Hospital, which is the country's national university hospital, to the ongoing COVID-19 crisis that continues to limit face-to-face access to physical medicine and rehabilitation services throughout the country. With the significant decline in the number of patients served since the start of the pandemic, the ITAWAG program aimed to bridge the physical distance between patients and clinicians after a set of eligibility criteria for teleconsultation or teletherapy and a step-by-step process used before, during, and after each virtual encounter. However, because many physical medicine and rehabilitation consultants, residents, and therapists were not trained for the virtual approach to patient care, a telerehabilitation curriculum was developed to help in providing quality and competent services. Finally, despite the growing awareness of telerehabilitation throughout the country, several research gaps about this emerging technology are identified to determine its acceptance, applicability, and cost-effectiveness among others.","Leochico, Carl Froilan D; Mojica, Jose Alvin P; Rey-Matias, Reynaldo R; Supnet, Isabella E; Ignacio, Sharon D",American journal of physical medicine & rehabilitation,99,20

PATIENTS AND METHODS In this multicentric descriptive study, surveys were distributed among 4 different Breast Cancer Centers (BCC). BCCs were distinguished according to COVID-19 tertiary care hospital (COVID/No-COVID) and district prevalence (DP) (High vs. Low). DASS-21 score, PSS score and demographic data (age, sex, work) were evaluated. RESULTS A total of 51 HCWs were analyzed in the study. Age, work and sex did not demonstrate statistically significant values. Statistically significant distribution was found between DASS-21-stress score and COVID/No-COVID (p=0.043). No difference was found in the remaining DASS-21 and PSS scores, dividing the HCWs according to COVID-19-hospital and DP. CONCLUSION Working in a COVID-19-hospital represents a factor that negatively affects psychosocial well-being. However, DP seems not to affect the psychosocial well-being of BCC HCWs.

The migration of the meiosis I spindle from the oocyte center to its cortex is mediated by F-actin. Specifically, an F-actin-cage surrounds the microtubule spindle and applies forces to it. To better understand how F-actin transmits forces to the spindle, we studied a potential direct link between F-actin and microtubules. For this, we tested the implication of Myosin-X, a known F-actin and microtubule binder involved in spindle morphogenesis and/or positioning in somatic cells, amphibian oocytes and embryos. Using a mouse strain conditionally invalidated for Myosin-X in oocytes and by live cell imaging, we show that Myosin-X is not localized on the spindle and dispensable for spindle and F-actin assembly. It is not required for force transmission since spindle migration and chromosome alignment occur normally. More broadly, Myosin-X is dispensable for oocyte developmental potential and female fertility. We therefore exclude a role for Myosin-X in transmitting F-actin-mediated forces to the spindle, opening new perspectives regarding this mechanism in mouse oocytes, which differs from most mitotic cells.","Crozet, Flora; Da Silva, Christelle; Verlhac, Marie-Hélène; Terret, Marie-Emilie",Development,99,0

This study aimed to determine whether a correlation exists between immediate postoperative gastroduodenal transit time and weight loss after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG). Specifically, correlation tests were conducted to determine whether more rapid transit after LSG correlated with increased weight loss. METHODS Data were collected from an institutional review board-approved electronic registry. All LSGs were performed over a 40-Fr bougie, starting 5 to 7 cm proximal to the pylorus. Gastroduodenal transit time (antrum to duodenum) was calculated from a postoperative day 1 esophagram. Pearson's correlation coefficient was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS The analysis included 62 consecutive LSG patients. The mean gastroduodenal transit time was 12.3 ± 19.8 s. Almost all the patients (99%) had a transit time less than 60 s. The mean percentage of excess weight loss (%EWL) was 23.8 ± 9.8% at 3 months, 37.9 ± 11.8% at 6 months, and 52.2 ± 10.8% at 12 months. No correlation was found between gastroduodenal transit time and %EWL at 3, 6, or 12 months.

Remote video auditing (RVA) is a tool that can monitor reprocessing compliance but it has not been previously evaluated in a tertiary care setting. The aims of this study were to evaluate: 1) RVA feasibility in a tertiary care setting (defined as the ability to audit every step of duodenoscope reprocessing without delaying the next procedure due to unavailability of duodenoscopes); and 2) the use of RVA as a compliance monitoring tool. METHODS : This was a prospective study at a tertiary care center. A video camera with offsite monitoring was installed in March 2018. Auditors delivered a compliance score after each procedure. The duodenoscope was not used until it passed the audit. Feasibility and compliance data were collected from April 2018 to August 2019 after a 1-month run-in phase. Both per-step compliance and overall 100 % compliance rates were measured. RESULTS : Of 743 duodenoscope reprocessing procedures, 32 666 individual steps were audited and 99.9 % of the steps were fully viewable. The mean time per audit was 38.3 minutes, the mean duodenoscope turnover time was 76.1 minutes, and there were no delays to the next procedure due to unavailability of duodenoscopes. The per-step compliance rate was 99.5 % but the overall 100 % compliance rate was 90.3 %. CONCLUSIONS : The use of RVA in duodenoscope reprocessing was feasible and promoted sustained high-level compliance in a tertiary care center.","Raphael, Kara L; McNoble, Ellen; Goldbeck, Jessica; Stiles, Megan; Miller, Larry S; Trindade, Arvind J",Endoscopy,99,31

The main subject of this article is to present a method to evaluate the applicability of building environmental assessment method in a given country. Here, when we say that a method is applicable in a given country, it means that it could be widely used and that it could produce the expected effects in terms of energy savings, environmental impact minimization, economic gain, etc. So, for this applicability evaluation purpose, the main criteria that affect the building environmental assessment method applicability were identified and were weighted by studying different scenarios. Then, the evaluation method was applied to the Tunisian case. Moreover, in order to contribute to a better understanding of the importance of building environmental assessment method implementation, stakes related thereto are reviewed. It was reported that building environmental assessment method would concur to improve building energy efficiency, enhance social capital, and contribute to environmental, social, and economic stability. In addition, it could be one of the major solutions for the collection of statistical data, which in turn would contribute to the success of projects undertaken as part of the green economy. Eventually, the building environmental assessment could be one of the major green marketing tools and should be taken into account by a company to improve profitability.

We studied that the variation of symptoms is explained by the nasopharyngeal bacteria and/or respiratory viruses. METHODS Children aged 6-35 months with acute symptoms with AOM (n = 201) or without AOM (n = 225) were eligible in this cross-sectional study. We analyzed their nasopharyngeal samples for pathogenic bacteria by culture and for respiratory viruses by polymerase chain reaction. We surveyed 17 symptoms (fever, respiratory, ear related, nonspecific, gastrointestinal) with a structured questionnaire. RESULTS Fever had a positive association with influenza viruses [odds ratio (OR): 6.61; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.66-26.27], human metapneumovirus (OR: 3.84; 95% CI: 1.25-11.77), coronaviruses (OR: 3.45; 95% CI: 1.53-7.75) and parainfluenza viruses (OR: 2.18; 95% CI: 1.07-4.47).

Therefore, an intra-operative navigation system is strongly recommended. We developed an augmented reality (AR) navigation system based on preoperative CT imaging. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the usefulness, feasibility, and accuracy of this system using laparoscopic splenectomy in children. METHODS Volume images were reconstructed by three-dimensional (3D) viewer application. We used an optical tracking system for registration between volume image and body surface markers. The AR visualization was superimposed preoperative 3D CT images onto captured laparoscopic live images. This system was applied to six cases of laparoscopic splenectomy in children. To evaluate registration accuracy, distances from the marker position to the volume data were calculated. RESULTS The operator recognized the hidden vascular variation of the splenic artery and vein, accessory spleen, and pancreatic tail by overlaying an image onto a laparoscopic live image. The registration accuracy of six cases was 5.30 ± 0.08, 5.71 ± 1.70, 10.1 ± 0.60, 18.8 ± 3.56, 4.06 ± 1.71, and 7.05 ± 4.71.

MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrieved the top 300 posts meeting the search criteria ""radiology."" User- and post-related data were categorized based on a prespecified coding system. Descriptive statistics were reported. Kruskal-Wallis H and Mann-Whitney U tests were performed to assess for differences in followers, plays, likes, and comments among posts and users. RESULTS 284 working posts were broadcast by 187 unique users with median 119 followers (interquartile range [IQR]: 31-1,206) and 20 posts (IQR: 7-49). Most (81%, 151/187) were nonphysician radiology personnel, while only 5% (9/187) were radiologists. Posts by radiologists had more plays than those by nonphysician radiology personnel (median 3643 vs 1282, P = 0.001). The 284 posts had median 1520 plays (IQR 429-4374), 60 likes (IQR 18-272), and 2 comments (IQR 0-9). Most posts were work-related (184/284, 65%), followed by clinical (68/284, 24%), personal (30/284, 11%), or promotional (2/284, 1%). However, posts by radiologists were mostly clinical (65%, 31/48) and represented a large majority of posted imaging cases (29/33, 88%). Posts about COVID-19 represented 38% (107/284) of the study sample and 48% (93/193) of posts after the first U.S. COVID-19 case COVID-19 posts had significantly more comments (3 vs. 2, P = 0.034) and more likes approaching significance (89 vs 51, P = 0.134) than non-COVID-19 posts.

Methods employed to standardize and control clinical chemistry testing have been applied to these serology tests. However, there is evidence that these methods are not suitable for infectious disease serology. An overriding reason is that, unlike testing for an inert chemical, testing for specific antibodies to infectious disease agents is highly variable; the measurand for each test system varies in choice of antigen, antibody classes/subclasses, modes of detection, and assay kinetics, and individuals' immune responses vary with time after exposure, individual immune-competency, nutrition, treatment, and exposure to variable circulating sero- or genotypes or organism mutations. Therefore, unlike that of inert chemicals, the quantification of antibodies cannot be standardized using traditional methods. However, there is evidence that the quantification of nucleic acid testing, reporting results in international units, has been successful across many viral load tests. Similarly, traditional methods used to control clinical chemistry testing, such as Westgard rules, are not appropriate for serology testing for infectious diseases, mainly due to variability due to frequent reagent lot changes. This review investigates the reasons why standardization and control of infectious diseases should be further investigated and more appropriate guidelines should be implemented.","Dimech, Wayne",Clinical microbiology reviews,99,12

Age-related impairments in innate immunity and sub-optimal virus-specific T cell and antibody responses are believed to cause severe disease upon respiratory virus infections. However, the basis for age-related fatal pneumonia following pathogenic hCoVs is not well understood. In this review article, we provide an overview of our current understanding of hCoV-induced fatal pneumonia in the elderly. We describe host immune response to hCoV infections derived from studies of young and aged animal models, and discuss the potential role of age-associated increases in sterile inflammation (inflammaging) and virus-induced dysregulated inflammation in causing age-related severe disease. We also highlight the existing gaps in our knowledge about virus replication and host immune responses to hCoV infection in young and aged individuals.","Channappanavar, Rudragouda; Perlman, Stanley",The Journal of clinical investigation,99,1

The objective of this review is to provide an overview of recently published studies examining ultrasound-guided diaphragm-sparing regional anesthesia techniques for the brachial plexus (BP) to favor their preferent use in patients at risk of respiratory function compromise. RECENT FINDINGS In the last 18 months, study findings on various diaphragm-sparing regional anesthesia techniques have demonstrated comparable block analgesic effectivity with a variable extent of phrenic nerve paralysis. The impact of hemi-diaphragmatic function impairment on clinical outcomes is yet to be established. SUMMARY Existing diaphragm-sparing brachial plexus regional anesthesia techniques used for shoulder and clavicle surgery may help minimize pulmonary complications by preserving lung function, especially in patients prone to respiratory compromise. Used as an anesthetic technique, they can reduce the risk of exposure of healthcare teams to aerosol-generating medical procedures (AGMPs), albeit posing an increased risk for hemi-diaphragmatic paralysis. Reducing the incidence of phrenic nerve involvement and obtaining opioid-sparing analgesia without jeopardizing efficacy should be prioritized goals of regional anesthesia practice during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Cubillos, Javier; Girón-Arango, Laura; Muñoz-Leyva, Felipe",Current opinion in anaesthesiology,99,12

Here, we evaluated the inactivation of two representative human enteric viruses (adenovirus type 40 [AdV] and coxsackievirus B5 [CV]) by thermal or free-chlorine disinfection. In addition, we compared the infectivity reduction ratio of a plant virus (pepper mild mottle virus [PMMoV], a recently proposed novel surrogate for human enteric viruses for the assessment of virus removal by coagulation‒rapid sand filtration and membrane filtration) with that of the two human enteric viruses to assess the suitability of PMMoV as a human enteric virus surrogate for use in thermal and free-chlorine disinfection processes. Finally, we examined whether conventional or enhanced viability polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis using propidium monoazide (PMA) or improved PMA (PMAxx) with or without an enhancer could be used as alternatives to infectivity assays (i.e., plaque-forming unit method for AdV and CV; local lesion count assay for PMMoV) for evaluating virus inactivation by disinfection processes. We found that PMMoV was more resistant to heat treatment than AdV and CV, suggesting that PMMoV is a potential surrogate for these two enteric viruses with regard to thermal disinfection processes. However, PMMoV was much more resistant to chlorine treatment compared with AdV and CV (which is chlorine-resistant) (CT value for 4-log10 inactivation: PMMoV, 84.5 mg-Cl2·min/L; CV, 1.15-1.19 mg-Cl2·min/L), suggesting that PMMoV is not useful as a surrogate for these enteric viruses with regard to free-chlorine disinfection processes. For thermal disinfection, the magnitude of the signal reduction observed with PMAxx-Enhancer-PCR was comparable with the magnitude of reduction in infectivity, indicating that PMAxx-Enhancer-PCR is a potential alternative to infectivity assay. However, for free-chlorine disinfection, the magnitude of the signal reduction observed with PMAxx-Enhancer-PCR was smaller than the magnitude of the reduction in infectivity, indicating that PMAxx-Enhancer-PCR underestimated the efficacy of virus inactivation (i.e., overestimated the infectious virus concentration) by chlorine treatment. Nevertheless, among the PCR approaches examined in the present study (PCR alone, PMA-PCR or PMAxx-PCR either with or without enhancer), PMAxx-Enhancer-PCR provided the most accurate assessment of the efficacy of virus inactivation by thermal or free chlorine disinfection processes.","Shirasaki, N; Matsushita, T; Matsui, Y; Koriki, S",Water research,99,1

Existing health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) measurement tools do not account for these differences. The objective of this study was to develop and validate a culturally specific parent-proxy HR-QoL measurement tool for First Nations children. DESIGN Scale development was informed by parents/carers of children with a chronic illness and an expert panel. The preliminary 39-item survey was reviewed (n=12) and tested (n=163) with parents/carers of First Nations children aged 0-12 years at baseline with comparative scales: the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale, generic HR-QoL (Paediatric QoL Inventory 4.0, PedsQL4.0) and Spence Children's Anxiety Scale, and repeated (n=46) 4 weeks later. Exploratory Factor Analysis was used for scale reduction. Reliability and validity were assessed by internal consistency, test-retest, and correlations with comparison scales. RESULTS Items within our First Nations-Child Quality of Life (FirstNations-CQoL) were internally consistent with Cronbach's alpha coefficients of ≥0.7 (quality of life, 0.808; patient experience, 0.880; patient support, 0.768) and overall test-retest reliability was good (r=0.75; 95% CI 0.593 to 0.856). Convergent validity was observed with the PedsQL4.0 with Pearson's coefficients of r=0.681 (ages 2-4 years); r=0.651 (ages 5-12 years) and with the Kessler Psychological Distress scale (r=-0.513). Divergent validity against the Spence Anxiety Scale was not demonstrated. CONCLUSIONS The FirstNations-CQoL scale was accepted by the participants, reliable and demonstrated convergent validity with comparison measures.

Such systems enable rapid detection and mapping of epidemics and inform allocation of scarce prevention and intervention resources. Although many lower- and middle-income settings lack infrastructure for optimal disease surveillance, health and demographic surveillance systems (HDSS) provide a unique opportunity for epidemic monitoring. This protocol describes a surveillance program at the Africa Health Research Institute's Population Intervention Platform site in northern KwaZulu-Natal. The program leverages a longstanding HDSS in a rural, resource-limited setting with very high prevalence of HIV and tuberculosis to perform Covid-19 surveillance. Our primary aims include: describing the epidemiology of the Covid-19 epidemic in rural KwaZulu-Natal; determining the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak and non-pharmaceutical control interventions (NPI) on behaviour and wellbeing; determining the impact of HIV and tuberculosis on Covid-19 susceptibility; and using collected data to support the local public-sector health response. The program involves telephone-based interviews with over 20,000 households every four months, plus a sub-study calling 750 households every two weeks. Each call asks a household representative how the epidemic and NPI are affecting the household and conducts a Covid-19 risk screen for all resident members. Any individuals screening positive are invited to a clinical screen, potential test and referral to necessary care - conducted in-person near their home following careful risk minimization procedures.

Evaluation of the components of ViroSAL revealed that caprylic acid was the main antiviral component; however, the ViroSAL formulation significantly inhibited viral entry compared with caprylic acid alone. In vivo, ViroSAL significantly inhibited Zika and Semliki Forest virus replication in mice following the inoculation of these viruses into mosquito bite sites. In agreement with studies investigating other free fatty acids, ViroSAL had no effect on norovirus, a non-enveloped virus, indicating that its mechanism of action may be surfactant disruption of the viral envelope.

However, in practice, recognition is essentially an open set problem. There are categories we know called ""knowns"", and there are more we do not know called ""unknowns"". Enumerating all categories beforehand is never possible, consequently, it is infeasible to prepare sufficient training samples for those unknowns. Applying closed set recognition methods will naturally lead to unseen-category errors. To address this problem, we propose the prototype-based Open Deep Network (P-ODN) for open set recognition tasks. Specifically, we introduce prototype learning into open set recognition. Prototypes and prototype radiuses are trained jointly to guide a CNN network to derive more discriminative features. Then P-ODN detects the unknowns by applying a multi-class triplet thresholding method based on the distance metric between features and prototypes. Manual labeling the unknowns which are detected in the previous process as new categories. Predictors for new categories are added to the classification layer to ""open"" the deep neural networks to incorporate new categories dynamically. The weights of new predictors are initialized exquisitely by applying a distances based algorithm to transfer the learned knowledge. Consequently, this initialization method speeds up the fine-tuning process and reduce the samples needed to train new predictors. Extensive experiments show that P-ODN can effectively detect unknowns and needs only few samples with human intervention to recognize a new category. In the real world scenarios, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the UCF11, UCF50, UCF101 and HMDB51 datasets.","Shu, Yu; Shi, Yemin; Wang, Yaowei; Huang, Tiejun; Tian, Yonghong",Scientific reports,99,17

Fifty-seven subjects performed one hour of repetitive screwing and fastening on three days, separated by 2⁻7 days. The average physical requirement and relative cycle-to-cycle variability (coefficient of variation, i.e., CV) were calculated from continuous recordings of electromyography of four arm muscles (biceps brachii, triceps brachii, flexor carpi radialis, extensor digitorum), forearm acceleration, and electrocardiography. Muscle activity levels, heart rate, and forearm acceleration decreased from day 1 to day 2 (range: ~4% to ~20%) and/or 3 (range: ~4% to ~28%). Not all muscles showed a similar pattern. Activity of the extensor digitorum and biceps brachii decreased already between days 1 and 2 (range: ~6% to ~13%), whereas activity of the flexor carpi radialis and triceps brachii decreased between days 1 and 3 (range: ~13% to ~20%). No changes in physical requirement were detected between days 2 and 3. Relative motor variability did not change across days, except that variability of forearm acceleration increased from day 1 to 3 (~5%). This study found consistent changes in physical requirements and indicated that several arm muscles show earlier decreases of muscular activity, like the extensor digitorum, compared to other body parts, like the flexor carpi radialis. Moreover, movement strategies may develop differently than muscle activation strategies, based on the different developments of physical requirements and motor variability. The development of physical requirements in industrial tasks is part of daily living and starts at task onset, highlighting the importance of task familiarization and the randomization of experimental conditions in scientific studies.","Luger, Tessy; Seibt, Robert; Rieger, Monika A; Steinhilber, Benjamin",International journal of environmental research and public health,99,1

METHODS Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) data were collected from 24 participants with chronic stroke and 11 healthy older individuals. Post-stroke motor function (Wolf Motor Function Test) and level of motor impairment (Fugl-Meyer score) were evaluated. RESULTS Fractional anisotropy (FA) of transcallosal tracts between prefrontal cortices and the mean amplitude decrease in muscle activity during the ipsilateral silent period evoked by TMS over the non-lesioned hemisphere (termed NL-iSPmean) were significantly associated with level of motor impairment and motor function after stroke (p<0.05). A regression model including age, post-stroke duration, lesion volume, lesioned corticospinal tract FA, transcallosal prefrontal tract FA and NL-iSPmean accounted for 84% of variance in motor impairment (p<0.01). Both transcallosal prefrontal tract FA (ΔR(2)=0.12, p=0.04) and NL-iSPmean (ΔR(2)=0.09, p=0.04) accounted for unique variance in motor impairment level.

It is unclear whether telephone-based services for people affected by chronic disease are a practical setting for implementing distress screening, referral protocols and rescreening to direct supportive care where it is needed. This systematic review aimed to describe the published literature regarding distress screening and supportive care referral practices in telephone-based services for people affected by chronic diseases such as cancer. METHODS A systematic literature search of MEDLINE, Embase, PsycInfo, CINAHL, Cochrane and Scopus was conducted in February 2018. Included quantitative studies involved: patients or caregivers affected by chronic diseases including cancer and describe a health service assessing psychosocial needs or distress via telephone. Extracted data included the type of cancer or other chronic disease, sample size, screening tool, referral or rescreening protocols, and type of health service. RESULTS The search identified 3989 potential articles with additional searches returning 30 studies (n = 4019); fourteen were eligible for full-text review. Of the 14 studies, 13 included cancer patients. Studies were across multiple settings and identified nine distress screening tools in use. CONCLUSION The reviewed studies indicate that validated distress-screening tools are being used via telephone to identify distress, particularly in relation to cancer.

Reduction in GHG emissions and energy insecurity imposed by the depleting fossil fuel reserves led to the search for alternative sustainable fuels. Hydrogen is a potential alternative energy carrier and is of particular interest because hydrogen combustion releases only water. Hydrogen is also an important industrial feedstock. As an alternative energy carrier, hydrogen can be used in fuel cells for power generation. Current hydrogen production mainly relies on fossil fuels and is usually energy and CO2 -emission intensive, thus the use of fossil fuel-derived hydrogen as a carbon-free fuel source is fallacious. Biohydrogen production can be achieved via microbial methods, and the use of microalgae for hydrogen production is outstanding due to the carbon mitigating effects and the utilization of solar energy as an energy source by microalgae. This review provides comprehensive information on the mechanisms of hydrogen production by microalgae and the enzymes involved. The major challenges in the commercialization of microalgae-based photobiological hydrogen production are critically analyzed and future research perspectives are discussed. Life cycle analysis and economic assessment of hydrogen production by microalgae are also presented. This article is protected by copyright.

We evaluated the efficacy of a group-led creative writing workshop (CWW) on mood in patients with cancer prospectively. METHODS We conducted a single-institution phase II study. Sixty adult patients with cancer (any type or stage) were randomised 2:1 to CWW (4×CWW sessions, bimonthly over 8 weeks) versus active control (AC) (independent writing at home with the help of a book, four sessions, bimonthly over 8 weeks). The total study duration was 6 months with a follow-up of up to 3 months. PRIMARY OBJECTIVE changes in overall mood, depression and anxiety symptoms before and after intervention in both arms. Emotional Thermometer Scale (ETS) was used to assess changes in patients' mood. Additionally, the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-9 and General Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD)-7 were used to evaluate depression and anxiety symptoms. RESULTS Of 50 evaluable patients (CWW 34, AC 17), 26 patients in the CWW arm attended at least one class and 19 attended at least four classes. Patients in CWW had significant immediate improvement in the overall ETS (post vs preclass scores; p<0.0001, 95% CI -4.31 to -2.47). Four of the five subscale ETS scores were significantly lower for the CWW arm: distress (p=0.0346, 95% CI -2.6 to -0.1), anxiety (p=0.0366, 95% CI -4.1 to -0.2), depression (p=0.0441, 95% CI -3.9 to -0.1) and anger (p=0.0494, 95% CI -3.3 to 0). No significant differences were seen in the AC arm. No significant differences were observed in the PHQ-9 or the GAD-7 scores. CONCLUSION CWW had a positive effect on mood based on ETS scores, suggesting a potential therapeutic benefit among patients with cancer.","Nesterova, Darya; Zhu, Junjia; Kramer, Courtney; Vasekar, Monali; Truica, Cristina; Joshi, Aditya; Hayes, Michael; Kessler, Jolene; Saunders, Erika F H; Drabick, Joseph J; Joshi, Monika",BMJ supportive & palliative care,99,8

OBJECTIVE In this study, we hypothesized that atorvastatin could prevent the neurons lost in the hippocampal dentate gyrus region after transient global ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) through its anti-oxidant and anti-apoptotic activities. METHOD Twenty-four male Wistar rats 12-13 weeks old and weighing 250-300 g, were divided randomly into four groups: control, I/R, vehicle (I/R treated with NaCl) and experiment (I/R treated with atorvastatin, 10 mg/kg) and rats were sacrificed 96 hours after I/R. Quantitative expression of genes (caspase 8, p53, bax, bcl2, cytochrome c) was studied. The MDA level, SOD, CAT, and GPx activities were measured with biochemical tests. To detect apoptotic cells, TUNEL and Nissl staining were performed. Mitochondria were prepared from the hippocampus rats, used to the quantification of mitochondrial ROS, ATP level, GSH content, membrane potential, cytochrome c release, and determination of mitochondrial swelling. RESULTS Atorvastatin attenuated the overexpression of bax, cytochrome C, p53, and caspase8 mRNAs and induced expression of bcl-2 mRNA (P<0.001). Atorvastatin treatment increased anti-oxidant enzyme levels (P<0.01). Treatment with atorvastatin reduced the number of TUNEL-positive cells. It could decrease the cytochrome c release (P<0.01), inhibit the decrease of MMP (P<0.001) and increased the ATP level (P<0.001) in mitochondrial hippocampal in compared with I/R group. CONCLUSION Atorvastatin treatment in I/R rats decreases oxidative stress, production of ROS, apoptosis rate in neuronal cells, and improves the mitochondrial function. Hence, atorvastatin have a proper neuronal protective effect against the I/R injury in the brain.","Yadollah-Damavandi, Soheila; Sharifi, Zahra Nadia; Arani, Hamid Zaferani; Jangholi, Ehsan; Karimi, Aliasghar; Parsa, Yekta; Movassaghi, Shabnam",CNS & neurological disorders drug targets,99,1

Although its cause and mechanism of progression are not well understood, various in vitro and in vivo experiments have proved that the decreased activity of the cholinergic neuron is responsible for the memory damage that is observed in these patients. Therefore, the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) is one of the possible drug targets for this disease. At present, extensive nAChR ligands have been designed, and some of the α7 nAChR agonists (e.g., DMXB-A and JN403) have been found to improve the memories and spatial abilities of animal models. However, most of the α7 nAChR agonists cannot be used therapeutically for various reasons, such as poor selectivity for nAChR subtypes, poor pharmacokinetic properties, or toxicity. In the current study, we built homology models of α7 nAChR and virtually screened possible nAChR ligands by combining molecular docking, molecular feature searches, hydrogen bond analyses, and quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) study. Our docking simulations and QSAR modeling were reasonably accurate and predictive of nAChR ligand affinity, and we have provided novel and reasonable computational methods for the virtual screening of possible α7 nAChR agonists that may be effectively used for the treatment of various neural disorders, particularly Alzheimer's disease. The compounds that were found in this study may be assessed in future in vitro or in vivo experiments for their affinities to nAChRs in addition to their biological functions.","Chen, Shi-Gao; Gu, Ruo-Xu; Dai, Hao; Wei, Dong-Qing",Journal of molecular graphics & modelling,99,5

The optimal method for histological assessment of response and the effect of NAET on the tumour morphology, grade and molecular profile remain unclear. MATERIAL AND METHODS A single large institution cohort of 132 patients who received NAET over a 13-year period was identified. Comprehensive clinical, histopathological and follow up data were collected. A detailed histological review of a subset with residual post-treatment carcinoma was undertaken. RESULTS Two carcinomas (both of lobular type) achieved complete pathological response. Central scarring was seen in 49.3% of tumours post-treatment. Significant changes in tumour type (41.6%), grade (downgrading in a third of tumours), PR expression (22.3%) with a switch to PR negative status in 17.6% of cases were observed. The latter was associated with absence of tumour infiltrating lymphocytes (p=0.005). 10% of cases showed a change in HER2 expression (p=0.002).

The purpose of this study was to delineate the efficacy of the authors' current surgical strategy in the management of MMD-associated aneurysms of different types. METHODS Between January 2007 and March 2016, a consecutive cohort of 34 patients with 36 MMD-associated aneurysms was enrolled in this prospective single-center cohort study. The lesions were classified as peripheral (17 aneurysms) or main trunk aneurysms (13 in the anterior circulation and 6 in the posterior circulation). For the peripheral aneurysms, revascularization with or without endovascular treatment was suggested. For the main trunk aneurysms, revascularization alone, revascularization with aneurysm clipping, or revascularization with aneurysm embolization were used, depending on the location of the aneurysms. RESULTS Of the peripheral aneurysms, 4 were treated endovascularly with staged revascularization, and 13 were treated solely with cerebral revascularization. Of the 13 main trunk aneurysms in the anterior circulation, 10 were clipped followed by revascularization, and 3 were coiled followed by staged cerebral revascularization. Of the 6 main trunk aneurysms in the posterior circulation, 4 underwent endovascular coiling and 2 were treated solely with revascularization. One patient died of contralateral intracerebral hemorrhage 6 months after the operation. No other patients suffered recurrent intracranial hemorrhage, cerebral ischemia, or aneurysm rupture. An angiographic follow-up study showed that all the bypass grafts were patent. Complete occlusion was achieved in all 21 aneurysms that were clipped or embolized. Of the remaining 15 aneurysms that were not directly treated, 12 of 13 peripheral aneurysms were obliterated during the follow-up, whereas 1 remained stable; 1 of 2 posterior main trunk aneurysms remained stable, and the other became smaller. CONCLUSIONS The authors' current treatment strategy may benefit patients with MMD-associated aneurysms.","Ni, Wei; Jiang, Hanqiang; Xu, Bin; Lei, Yu; Yang, Heng; Su, Jiabin; Gu, Yuxiang; Mao, Ying",Journal of neurosurgery,99,26

The complexity of periodontal tissue and the local inflammatory microenvironment poses great challenges to tissue repair. Recently, stem cells have been considered a promising strategy to treat tissue damage and inflammation because of their remarkable properties, including stemness, proliferation, migration, multilineage differentiation, and immunomodulation. Several varieties of stem cells can potentially be applied to periodontal regeneration, including dental mesenchymal stem cells (DMSCs), nonodontogenic stem cells, and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). In particular, these stem cells possess extensive immunoregulatory capacities. In periodontitis, these cells can exert anti-inflammatory effects and regenerate the periodontium. Stem cells derived from infected tissue possess typical stem cell characteristics with lower immunogenicity and immunosuppression. Several studies have demonstrated that these cells can also regenerate the periodontium. Furthermore, the interaction of stem cells with the surrounding infected microenvironment is critical to periodontal tissue repair. Though the immunomodulatory capabilities of stem cells are not entirely clarified, they show promise for therapeutic application in periodontitis. Here, we summarize the potential of stem cells for periodontium regeneration in periodontitis and focus on their characteristics and immunomodulatory properties as well as challenges and perspectives.","Wang, Mengyuan; Xie, Jiang; Wang, Cong; Zhong, Dingping; Xie, Liang; Fang, Hongzhi",Stem cells international,99,16

It is unknown whether the THRIVE score can also predict outcome in everyday clinical practice. Using our prospectively obtained stroke database the utility of the THRIVE score to predict clinical and radiological outcome in everyday clinical practice was analysed. METHODS The relationships between THRIVE and good outcome (modified Rankin Scale ≤ 2 at discharge), poor outcome (modified Rankin Scale 5-6), in-hospital death, symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage (SICH) as well as infarct size were examined in patients with distal intracranial carotid artery, M1 and M2 occlusions after either IVT or ET. RESULTS From January 2008 to October 2016 a total of 546 patients were treated with IVT and 492 patients received ET with stent retrievers (with or without IVT). In both treatment groups the THRIVE score predicted clinical outcome (Mantel-Haenszel chi-squared tests for trend P < 0.001 for good outcome, P < 0.001 for poor outcome and P < 0.001 for in-hospital death). In the ET group the THRIVE score remained an independent predictor of outcome after controlling for recanalization. The THRIVE score was associated with the infarct size after IVT or ET, whereas it did not predict SICH rates in either treatment group. CONCLUSIONS In everyday clinical practice the THRIVE score strongly predicts clinical outcome and the extent of ischaemia after ET or IVT in patients with anterior circulation large vessel occlusions.","Kastrup, A; Brunner, F; Hildebrandt, H; Roth, C; Winterhalter, M; Gießing, C; Papanagiotou, P",European journal of neurology,99,30

They typically show small size, hemispherical shape, fragile wall, broad neck, and are arising from non-branching sites of intracranial arteries. MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively reviewed all aneurysms treated at our institution. Seventeen patients (6 male, 11 female) with 17 blister aneurysms were identified (mean age 53.3, range 41-63 years). Clinical, procedural, angiographic data as well as follow up data were evaluated. RESULTS All patients presented with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Majority of the blister aneurysms were located in ICA while 1 was located at posterior cerebral artery, 1 at vertebral and 1 involving basilar artery. All patients were treated using single or overlapping stents and if possible additional coiling. There was no intra-operative rupture. Good outcome (mrs 0-2) was seen in 14 patients. Poor clinical outcome (mrs 3-5) was seen in 2 patients due to vasospasm induced ischemic deficits at discharge, both of them improved on follow up (mrs 1 on follow up). There were 3 mortalities, One patient died of rebleeding while other 2 died due to SAH induced complications. Follow-up angiography was available in 16 patients (one patient died before follow up angiogram) and revealed complete or near complete aneurysm occlusion in 11, incomplete obliteration in 1 and no change in 2 cases. Two cases showed post-treatment angiographic aneurysm recurrence. Both cases were managed with repeat coiling and overlapping stent placement. CONCLUSION Endovascular management using single/overlapping stent and if possible coil placement is technically safe and feasible in blister aneurysms.

Material and methods Internal Medicine Society and Group of Systemic Autoimmune disease conducted a telematic survey of patients with SAD to learn about the characteristics of COVID-19 in this population. Results A total of 2,789 patients answered the survey, of which 28 had a diagnosis of uveitis associated with SAE. The majority (82%) were female and caucasian (82%), with a mean age of 48 years. The most frequent SAEs were Behçet's disease followed by sarcoidosis and systemic lupus erythematosus. 46% of the patients were receiving corticosteroid treatment at a mean prednisone dose of 11 mg/day. Regarding infection, 14 (50%) patients reported symptoms compatible with SARS-CoV-2 infection. RT-PCR was performed on the nasopharyngeal smear in two patients and in one of them (4%) it was positive. Conclusions Both asymptomatic and symptomatic COVID-19 patients with ASD-associated UNI had received similar immunosuppressive treatment.","Fanlo, P; Espinosa, G; Adán, A; Arnáez, R; Fonollosa, A; Heras, H; Oteiza, J; Del Carmelo Gracia Tello, B; Comet, L Sáez; Pallarés, L",Archivos de la Sociedad Espanola de Oftalmologia,99,19

DESIGN This was a systematic review to identify controlled studies assessing the impact of point-of-care CRP in patients presenting to ambulatory care services. Ovid Medline, Embase, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane CENTRAL, DARE, Science Citation Index were searched from inception to March 2017. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES Controlled studies assessing the impact of point-of-care CRP in patients presenting to ambulatory care services, measuring a change in clinical care, including but not limited to antibiotic prescribing rate, reconsultation, clinical recovery, patient satisfaction, referral and additional tests. No language restrictions were applied. DATA EXTRACTION Data were extracted on setting, date of study, a description of the intervention and control group, patient characteristics and results. Methodological quality of selected studies and assessment of potential bias was assessed independently by two authors using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. RESULTS 11 randomised controlled trials and 8 non-randomised controlled studies met the inclusion criteria, reporting on 16 064 patients. All included studies had a high risk of performance and selection bias. Compared with usual care, point-of-care CRP reduces immediate antibiotic prescribing (pooled risk ratio 0.81; 95% CI 0.71 to 0.92), however, at considerable heterogeneity (I2=72%). This effect increased when guidance on antibiotic prescribing relative to the CRP level was provided (risk ratios of 0.68; 95% CI 0.63 to 0.74 in adults and 0.56; 95% CI 0.33 to 0.95 in children). We found no significant effect of point-of-care CRP testing on patient satisfaction, clinical recovery, reconsultation, further testing and hospital admission. CONCLUSIONS Performing a point-of-care CRP test in ambulatory care accompanied by clinical guidance on interpretation reduces the immediate antibiotic prescribing in both adults and children. As yet, available evidence does not suggest an effect on other patient outcomes or healthcare processes.

However, interdisciplinary and integrated frameworks for holistic CC assessments are still missing. The goal of this study was to generate expert consensus on best evaluative practices for holistic CC assessments of ocean-based salmon aquaculture. To achieve this goal, a 3-round Delphi study was conducted with 21 aquaculture and carrying capacity experts from around the world. Experts emphasized that the holistic CC process should i) engage all stakeholders in the process, ii) consider the combination of social, political, ecological, and economic aspects, iii) respond to changes over time, iv) consider multiple spatial and temporal scales, and v) be understandable and clear to all stakeholders involved. Furthermore, the expert panel emphasized the need for a cyclical and dynamic process that allows for the incorporation of feedback in the planning stages, embracing adaptive management. Due to the early stages of truly holistic assessments, the experts recognized challenges related to knowledge uncertainties and lack of approaches to integrate socio-economic data with ecological and physical data, potential conflicts arising from a multi-stakeholder process, and ill-equipped governance structures. The proposed guidelines and framework could help address some of the conceptual and procedural barriers to implementing holistic assessments into decision-making and may position CC as a useful decision-support tool for governments seeking sustainable aquaculture management.","Weitzman, Jenny; Filgueira, Ramón; Grant, Jon",Journal of environmental management,99,16

The antichemotactic activity of the hydroethanolic extracts, miquelianin, and myricitrin were assayed at concentrations 0.001 to 10 µg/mL in the lipopolysaccharide-induced chemotaxis on rat polymorphonuclear neutrophils. All the assayed samples displayed antichemotactic activity with reduction of the neutrophil migration in the range of 4.46-100%, and an IC50 value in the range of 0.30-1.24 µg/mL. Thus, this study demonstrates that the extracts hydroethanolic of Cuphea species, miquelianin, and myricitrin display a significant antichemotactic activity.

METHOD A total of 1017 placebo-treated patients with baseline Hamilton Depression rating scale (HAMD) total ≥15 from eight duloxetine RCTs were included. Remission was defined as endpoint (7-8 weeks) HAMD total ≤7. Data were randomly split into training data (N = 813, 80%) for model selection and test data (N = 204, 20%) for validation. Logistic regression and classification and regression tree (CART) methods were used to identify predictors of remission. Predictive accuracy of models was assessed by Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curves. RESULTS Baseline predictors for remission with placebo consistently identified with the logistic regression and CART analysis were less severe depressive symptoms (based on HAMD core symptoms), younger age, less anxiety (based on HAMD anxiety/somatization), and shorter current MDD episode duration. Associated cut-off values from the CART method characterized patient groups according to their remission likelihood. However, the predictive accuracy was modest for both methods with areas under the ROC curve of 0.6-0.65 based on test data. CONCLUSION The derived models, although of limited value for predicting remission in individual patients, may be useful for adjusting for placebo effects in clinical trials.","Nelson, J C; Zhang, Q; Deberdt, W; Marangell, L B; Karamustafalioglu, O; Lipkovich, I A",Current medical research and opinion,99,9

Angiographic outcomes were studied with angiography and MRA at 6 months, 1 year, and 3 years. We evaluated 50 carotid-ophthalmic aneurysms in 48 patients, among whom 44 patients with 46 aneurysms underwent treatment. The mean clinical follow-up was 29 ± 22 months (range, 0-65 months). There were no permanent adverse visual outcomes. There was 1 death because of late intraparenchymal hemorrhage (2.2%). Six-month angiography showed complete occlusion in 24 of 37 patients (64.9%), and 3-year angiography results showed occlusion in 24 of 25 patients (96%). In conclusion, flow diversion is a safe and effective treatment for carotid-ophthalmic aneurysms in carefully selected patients. The risk of adverse visual outcomes is low, and most aneurysms progress to complete occlusion.","Burrows, A M; Brinjikji, W; Puffer, R C; Cloft, H; Kallmes, D F; Lanzino, G",AJNR.

METHODS We assessed QOL in patients with ischemic stroke or TIA at 3 and 12 months postdischarge in the Adherence eValuation After Ischemic stroke-Longitudinal Registry using the European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) instrument. We generated multivariable linear regression models to evaluate the association between sex and EQ-5D while sequentially adjusting for sociodemographic, clinical, and stroke-related variables. We also used a proportional odds model to assess sex differences in the change in EQ-5D scores from 3 to 12 months. RESULTS A total of 1,370 patients were included, 53.7% male, median age 65 years (interquartile range 56-77 years). Women had significantly lower QOL at 3 months (unadjusted EQ-5D 0.81 in women vs 0.84 in men; p < 0.001) and 12 months (0.83 vs men 0.84; p < 0.001) poststroke. After multivariable adjustment for sociodemographic, clinical, and stroke-related factors, women continued to have lower QOL at 3 months (mean difference -0.036; p = 0.003) and at 12 months (mean difference -0.022; p = 0.046). Women fared worse in the dimensions of mobility, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression at 3 and 12 months. There were no sex differences in change in EQ-5D score from 3 to 12 months.

This study intends to gather the available evidence with respect to diagnosing NTM cervicofacial lymphadenitis. METHODS A review protocol was developed based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA)-statement (www.prisma-statement.org). A comprehensive search was performed in the bibliographic databases PubMed, Embase.com and Wiley/Cochrane Library. 10 Articles fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. Assessing risk of bias of the articles was done using the revised Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy (QUADAS-2) tool. RESULTS This systematic review shows that diagnostic studies of high methodological quality are scarce. Diagnostic accuracy of polymerase chain reaction (PCR), culture, skin testing, auramine staining, Ziehl-Neelsen staining, and immunodiagnostic assays was studied. Culture sensitivity proved to be 41,8%, while polymerase chain reaction has a sensitivity of 71,6%. Both methods showed a specificity of 100%. Sensitivity of Immunodiagnostic assays ranged between 87,5% and 100% and specificity between 81% and 100%. Overall sensitivity of skin tests containing purified protein derivative (PPD-S) was 70% (95% CI [62%-78%]) with an overall specificity of 94% (95% CI [88%-100%]). CONCLUSIONS In patients with a high clinical suspicion for NTM cervicofacial lymphadenitis, a positive PPD-S skin is indicative for the diagnosis of NTM cervicofacial lymphadenitis. Either PCR or culture is necessary to confirm the diagnosis. Interferon-γ release assays with purified protein derivative stimulation appear to provide good sensitivity and specificity as a non-invasive pre-operative test, but the evidence is weak. More studies of high methodological quality are needed to validate the results of this systematic review.","Willemse, S H; Oomens, M A E M; De Lange, J; Karssemakers, L H E",International journal of pediatric otorhinolaryngology,99,1

To estimate excess all-cause mortality in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, during the COVID-19 pandemic and understand the distribution of excess mortality in the population. Methods. With a Poisson model trained on recent historical data from the Pennsylvania vital registration system, we estimated expected weekly mortality in 2020. We compared these estimates with observed mortality to estimate excess mortality. We further examined the distribution of excess mortality by age, sex, and race/ethnicity. Results. There were an estimated 3550 excess deaths between March 22, 2020, and January 2, 2021, a 32% increase above expectations. Only 77% of excess deaths (n=2725) were attributed to COVID-19 on the death certiﬁcate. Excess mortality was disproportionately high among older adults and people of color. Sex differences varied by race/ethnicity. Conclusions. Excess deaths during the pandemic were not fully explained by COVID-19 mortality; ofﬁcial counts signiﬁcantly undercount the true death toll. Far from being a great equalizer, the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated preexisting disparities in mortality by race/ethnicity. Public Health Implications.

RECENT FINDINGS Current evidence unquestionably supports the use of LSFF to improve micronutrient status. Evidence syntheses have also demonstrated impact on some functional outcomes, including anemia, wasting, underweight, and neural tube defects, that underpin poor health and development. Importantly, many of these effects have also been reflected in effectiveness studies that examine LSFF in real-world situations as opposed to under-controlled environments. However, programmatic challenges must be addressed in LMICs in order for LSFF efforts to reach their full potential.

RECENT FINDINGS The heart transplantation allocation policy was recently reviewed in the USA in an effort to reduce waitlist mortality and to ensure fair geographic allocation of organs to the sickest patients. Moreover, patients with chronic infectious diseases, as well as malignancies, are being currently considered acceptable candidates for transplantation. Listing practices for heart transplantation vary between programmes, with a greater willingness to consider high-risk candidates at higher-volume centres. SUMMARY The ultimate decision to place high-risk candidates on the heart transplantation waitlist should be based on a combination of quantitative and qualitative data analysis informed by clinical judgement, and the chronic shortage of organ donors makes this process an important ethical concern for any society. Future guidelines should discuss approaches to achieve fair organ allocation while preserving improved outcomes after transplantation.","Vieira, Jefferson L; Mehra, Mandeep R",Current opinion in organ transplantation,99,1

We examined the long-term effects of sheet materials using an animal pleural defect model. METHODS Beagles were used for this study. The 5-mm circular pleural defects were created at 2 sites on each of the anterior, medial, and posterior lobe and repaired using a 2 cm square sheet material. The frequency of adhesion of those sheets to the thoracic walls and histological changes was examined after 6 months. In this study, three types of sheet materials were examined: polyglycolic acid, nano-polyglycolic acid, and oxidized regenerated cellulose where each sheet was tested with or without coating with fibrin glue, for a total of 6 groups. Each group contained an equal number of defect sites and evaluation of 12 defect sites was conducted. RESULTS Adhesion was observed in 16 of 72 sites (22%). Presence or absence of adhesion was not affected by the repair method or by the type of sheet material used. However, the use of fibrin glue significantly reduced the occurrence of adhesion (p = 0.023). At the defected sites, the posterior lobe showed significantly less adhesion (p = 0.019). Histologically, the sheet materials caused a thickening of the pleural wall 6-10 times thicker than the normal pleural wall. CONCLUSION No statistically significant differences regarding the presence or absence of adhesion to the thoracic wall were found among the sheet materials. The use of fibrin glue significantly reduced the adhesion to the thoracic wall.","Kanai, Eiichi; Matsutani, Noriyuki; Aso, Tatsuya; Yamamoto, Yasuto; Sakai, Takashi",General thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,99,5

S. viridis was unable to survive exposed to sodium chloride (NaCl) levels higher than 100 mM, in contrast, S. alterniflora could tolerate NaCl up to 550 mM, with negligible effect on gas exchange related parameters and conductance of electrons transport chain (gETC). Under salt, the prompt fluorescence (OJIP-curves) exhibits an increase in the O- and J-steps in S. viridis and much less for S. alterniflora. Flowing NaCl stress, a dramatic decline in the photosystem II (PSII) primary photochemistry was observed for S. viridis, as reflected by the drastic drop in Fv/Fm, Fv/Fo and ΦPSII; however, no substantial change was recorded for these parameters in S. alterniflora. Interestingly, we found an increase in the primary PSII photochemistry (ΦPSII) for S. alterniflora with increasing either NaCl concentration or NaCl treatment duration. The NPQ magnitude was strongly enhanced for S. viridis even at a low NaCl (50 mM); however, it remains unchangeable or slightly increased for S. alterniflora at NaCl levels above 400 mM. After NaCl treatment, we found an increase in both the proportion of oxidized P700 and the amount of active P700 in S. viridis and almost no change for S. alterniflora. Under salt, the net photosynthetic rate (A) and stomatal conductance (gs) measurements demonstrate that A decreases earlier in S. viridis, even after one week exposure to only 50 mM NaCl; in contrast, in S. alterniflora, the effect of NaCl on A and gs was minor even after exposure for two weeks to high NaCl levels. For S. viridis exposed to 50 mM NaCl for 12 d, carbon dioxide (CO2) at a concentration of 2000 μL L-1 could not fully restore A to the control (Ctrl) level. Conversely, in S. alterniflora, high CO2 can fully restore A for all NaCl treatments except at 550 mM. RNA-seq data shows a major impact of NaCl on metabolic pathways in S. viridis and we found a number of transcription factors potentially related to NaCl responses. For S. alterniflora, no major changes in the transcriptomic levels were recorded under NaCl stress. To confirm our data analysis of RNA-seq, we performed quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis for randomly selected four genes for each species (8 genes in total) and we found that our results (up- and/or down-regulated genes) are fully consistent and match well our RNA-seq data.

The most prevalent disease-linked mutation is the I1061T variant of NPC1, which exhibits defective folding and trafficking from the endoplasmic reticulum to the LE/Ly compartments. We now show that the FDA-approved histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) valproic acid (VPA) corrects the folding and trafficking defect associated with I1061T-NPC1 leading to restoration of cholesterol homeostasis, an effect that is largely driven by a reduction in HDAC7 expression. The VPA-mediated trafficking correction is in part associated with an increase in the acetylation of lysine residues in the cysteine-rich domain of NPC1. The HDACi-mediated correction is synergistically improved by combining it with the FDA-approved anti-malarial, chloroquine, a known lysosomotropic compound, which improved the stability of the LE/Ly-localized fraction of the I1061T variant. We posit that combining the activity of VPA, to modulate epigenetically the cellular acetylome, with chloroquine, to alter the lysosomal environment to favor stability of the trafficked I1061T variant protein, can have a significant therapeutic benefit in patients carrying at least one copy of the I1061T variant of NPC1, the most common disease-associated mutation leading to NPC disease. Given its ability to cross the blood brain barrier, we posit VPA provides a potential mechanism to improve the response to 2-hydroxypropyl-b-cyclodextrin, by restoring a functional NPC1 to the cholesterol managing compartment as an adjunct therapy.","Subramanian, Kanagaraj; Hutt, Darren M; Scott, Samantha M; Gupta, Vijay; Mao, Shu; Balch, William E",The Journal of biological chemistry,99,0

However, randomized comparisons are lacking. This study presents the results of a prospective randomized trial of SILS or 3-port laparoscopic appendectomy. STUDY DESIGN Adults with uncomplicated acute appendicitis were randomized 1:1 to either SILS or 3-port laparoscopic appendectomy. The primary end point was early postoperative pain (measured by opiate usage and pain score in the first 12 hours). Secondary end points were operative time, complication rate (including conversions), and recovery time (days of oral opiate usage and return to work). After 6 months, body image and cosmetic appearance were assessed using a validated survey. RESULTS The trial was planned for 150 patients, but was halted after 75 patients when planned interim analysis showed that SILS patients had more postoperative pain (pain score: 4.4 ± 1.6 vs 3.5 ± 1.5; p = 0.01) and higher inpatient opiate usage (hydromorphone use: 3.9 ± 1.9 mg vs 2.8 ± 1.7 mg; p = 0.01) than 3-port laparoscopy. Operative time for SILS averaged 40% longer (54 ± 17 minutes vs 38 ± 11 minutes; p < 0.01). Only 1 SILS case was converted to 3-port. There were no significant differences in length of stay, complications, oral pain medication usage after discharge, or return to work. After 6 months, body image and cosmetic appearance were excellent for both groups and indistinguishable by most measures. However, 3-port patients reported better physical attractiveness (4.0 ± 0.4 vs 3.8 ± 0.4; p = 0.04) and SILS patients reported better scars (score 18.4 ± 2.7 vs 16.4 ± 3.0; p < 0.01). Results are reported as mean ± SD. CONCLUSIONS Single-incision laparoscopic surgery appendectomy resulted in more pain and longer operative times without improving short-term recovery or complications. Long-term body image and cosmetic appearance were excellent in both groups.","Carter, Jonathan T; Kaplan, Jennifer A; Nguyen, Jason N; Lin, Matthew Y C; Rogers, Stanley J; Harris, Hobart W",Journal of the American College of Surgeons,99,27

We systematically reviewed the long-term effects of early macronutrient supplementation in preterm and SGA animals and whether these differ by sex. Using Cochrane Neonatal and SYRCLE methodologies we included random or quasi-random studies that allocated non-human mammals to macronutrient supplements or no supplements between birth and weaning and assessed post-weaning outcomes. We used random-effects models to calculate standardized mean differences (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Six studies provided low to very-low-quality evidence that macronutrient supplementation increased weight in juvenile rats (SMD; 95% CI: 2.13; 1.00, 3.25; 1 study, n = 24), increased leptin concentrations in older adults (1.31; 0.12, 2.51; 1 study, n = 14 male rats), but decreased leptin concentrations in young adults (-1.13; -2.21, -0.05; 1 study, n = 16 female rats) and improved spatial learning and memory (qualitative data; 1 study). There was no evidence of sex-specific effects and no overall effect on length, serum lipids, body composition, HOMA-IR, or blood pressure. Macronutrient supplements may affect later growth, metabolism, and neurodevelopment of preterm and SGA animals, but evidence is limited and low quality.","Amissah, Emma; Lin, Luling; Gamble, Gregory D; Crowther, Caroline A; Bloomfield, Frank H; Harding, Jane E",Scientific reports,99,24

METHODS Prospective observational case series study in patients requiring corneal graft manage toward separate free and restricted pathways for those COVID-19 negative or positive, respectively. RESULTS During the national lockdown, 30 consecutive patients underwent endothelial (n = 16), penetrating (n = 9), and anterior lamellar keratoplasty (n = 5). Two patients followed the COVID-19 restricted pathway, as they were considered positive while waiting for test results. Nine patients were hospitalized one night in the hospital. On admission to the hospital before surgery, at surgery, the day after surgery and at 7 and 30 days all patients and health-care personnel showed no symptoms and resulted negative at risks factors/exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 infection and occurrence of COVID-19. Nucleic acid testing resulted not detectable in all patients and SARS-CoV-2 antibodies quantification showed IgG and IgM below the positive predicted value in 29 patients. One patient showed IgM above the cut-off of significance (1.21 and 1.03 preoperative and 1-month postoperative, respectively) that were considered irrelevant because of the absence of symptoms and exposure risks. CONCLUSIONS The concept of donor emergency (i.e. short-term availability of transplant tissues), makes corneal transplantation an always-urgent activity because it is related to the availability of the corneal tissue from a donor. Modest adjustments to ophthalmic clinic and eye surgery organization are required to maintain surgery and care of eye patients in a safe environment.","Franch, Antonella; Fasolo, Adriano; Carraro, Paolo; Favarato, Mosè; Birattari, Federica; Leon, Pia E; Ponzin, Diego",European journal of ophthalmology,99,5

METHODS The clinical data of inpatients in the Department of Kidney Transplantation from January 24, 2020 to February 29, 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, we conducted telephone, Wechat follow-up, and online education for kidney transplant recipients and patients on waiting-list for kidney transplantation one by one. We also strictly screened for COVID-19 in outpatients. To guarantee the security of medical staff and recipients and to reduce the transmission risk of COVID-19, we have made detailed approaches to prevent COVID-19, which mainly included 6 aspects of preventive approaches, such as kidney transplant clinic, kidney transplant ward, patients on waiting-list for kidney transplantation, kidney transplant operation, medical staff self-protection, and postoperative follow-up of kidney transplant recipients. RESULTS There were altogether 47 inpatients which included 20 recipients who had just received kidney transplantation in the meantime, 2 577 kidney transplant recipients, 1 689 patients on waiting-list for kidney transplantation, and 794 outpatients in our hospital. No case of COVID-19 occurred in this period.

In 4016 healthy middle-aged (43 ± 9 years) Japanese men without CVD at baseline, the conventional risk factors for CVD, brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (brachial-ankle PWV) and radial augmentation index (rAI) were measured annually over a 9-year period. Mixed-model linear regression analysis demonstrated a significant independent positive longitudinal association of the mean blood pressure with both the brachial-ankle PWV (estimate = 5.51, standard error = 0.30, P < 0.01) and the rAI (estimate = 0.19, standard error = 0.02, P < 0.01). On the other hand, the serum levels of glycohemoglobin, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides showed longitudinal associations only with the brachial-ankle PWV and not the rAI. In addition, while the radial AI was found to show a significant longitudinal association with the brachial-ankle PWV, the inverse association was not significant. In conclusion, the conventional risk factors for CVD showed heterogeneous longitudinal associations with arterial stiffness and/or abnormal pressure wave reflection. Elevated blood pressure showed independent longitudinal associations with both arterial stiffness (macrovascular damage) and abnormal pressure wave reflection, suggesting that BP is also longitudinally associated, at least in part, with microvascular damage. On the other hand, abnormal glucose metabolism and dyslipidemia showed independent longitudinal associations with only arterial stiffness (macrovascular damage).","Fujii, Masatsune; Tomiyama, Hirofumi; Nakano, Hiroki; Iwasaki, Yoichi; Matsumoto, Chisa; Shiina, Kazuki; Yamashina, Akira; Chikamori, Taishiro",Hypertension research : official journal of the Japanese Society of Hypertension,99,31

METHODS AND RESULTS Between January 2001 and December 2012, 34 patients (mean age 59.9 ± 11.0 years) with complicated AAAD (DeBakey I) underwent an emergency surgery including sFETT. sFETT consisted in gluing the dissected aortic arch wall layers with gelatine-resorcinol adhesive and video-assisted antegrade open arch aortic stent-graft deployment in the arch or proximal descending aorta. In addition to sFETT, the aortic root was addressed with standard techniques. A 30-day mortality was 14.7% (five patients) due to bleeding (1), multiple organ failure (2), and colon ischemia (2). Postoperative morbidity included neurological (2), renal (1) and cardio-pulmonary complications (4), as well as wound infection (1). Mean follow-up was 74.4 ± 45.0 months. Actual survival rates were 73.5% at 1 year, 70.2% at 5 years, and 58.5% at 13 years of follow-up. Six patients died during long-term follow-up from heart failure (1) and unknown reasons (5). Five patients required reoperation for aortic arch (3) or aorto-iliac (2) progression of aneurysm during the mid- and long-term follow-up. The remaining patients showed favorable evolution of the dissected aorta with false lumen occlusion in most cases and stable aortic diameters. CONCLUSIONS In AAAD patients, sFETT as used in our series is an easy and safe technique to repair the aortic arch. Long-term results after sFETT showed false lumen occlusion and stable aortic diameter in up to 13 years of follow-up.","Kobayashi, Misato; Chaykovska, Lyubov; van der Loo, Bernd; Nguyen, Thi Dan Linh; Puippe, Gilbert; Salzberg, Sacha; Ueda, Hideki; Maisano, Francesco; Pecoraro, Felice; Lachat, Mario",Vascular,99,19

To carry out the study, data from PINTEC2017 on innovation activities from 55 sectors in Brazil from 2015 to 2017 were analysed. The hypotheses were tested with the application of structural equation modelling using SmartPLS. The results show that environmental management accounting (EMA) affects product innovation directly and process innovation indirectly through environmental management techniques. These results show that the use of EMA techniques contributes differently to each stage of innovation (processes and products). Thus, industries with new and improved products for the national market innovate their processes with the use of new technologies, training and innovation activities. These results are most evident in the sectors of paper and cellulose, petroleum products, chemicals and the manufacturing of machinery for extraction and construction. These results show that environmental management techniques interact with process innovation, mainly in industries that promote product innovation, and that process innovation has led to a reduction in water and energy consumption.","da Rosa, Fabricia Silva; Lunkes, Rogério João; Mendes, Alcindo Cipriano",Environmental monitoring and assessment,99,1

However, patient engagement in research and guideline development remains suboptimal, particularly for vulnerable populations, including residents with dementia living in long-term care (LTC) who are often not included in research and guideline development because of perceived and actual challenges with their health, memory, concentration and communication. Optimal strategies and methods for engaging LTC residents with dementia in research and guideline development remain unknown. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will conduct a scoping review in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) extension to answer the research questions: (1) What methods have been used to engage LTC residents with dementia in research and guideline development? (2) What are the outcomes of resident engagement? (3) What are the barriers and facilitators to resident engagement? Systematic searches for peer-reviewed articles will be conducted in: Academic Search Premier (EBSCO), APA PsycINFO (EBSCO), CINAHL (EBSCO), Medline (OVID), Embase (Elsevier), Web of Science, and Cochrane Database and in grey literature. Two team members will screen articles and extract data. Results will be presented according to the research question they address. We will engage stakeholders including residents, family members, healthcare providers and representatives from relevant organisations throughout the study. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION The scoping review will synthesise what is known about resident engagement in research and guideline development. It may identify gaps in the literature about the optimal methods to engage residents in performing research and developing guidelines and reveal opportunities for new methods. The results will be helpful for researchers and policy-makers seeking to develop guidelines and researchers engaging in topics that reflect the priorities and experiences of people with dementia. Results of the scoping review will be disseminated via publication in a peer-reviewed journal and conference presentations, and a one-page lay summary will be shared with our engaged stakeholders.","McArthur, Caitlin; Quigley, Adria; Affoo, Rebecca; Earl, Marie; Moody, Elaine",BMJ open,99,17

METHODS PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science, and PsycINFO were searched since their inception to August 6, 2019. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-experimental articles that enrolled community women aged 18 years and older and reported storage LUTS outcomes including symptoms, severity, impact, self-reported symptom improvement, and PFMS were screened and extracted. Risk of bias was evaluated, and a narrative synthesis approach was used to synthesize evidence. RESULTS Ten RCTs and three pretest-posttest articles were retrieved. Half of the RCTs had some concerns of bias; the remaining RCTs had high risk of bias. Three pretest-posttest articles had at least some risk of bias. Ten articles aimed to treat urinary incontinence (UI) primarily in middle-aged women, two aimed to prevent UI, and one aimed to improve PFMS in young continent women. Two months post-intervention, UI treatment effectiveness was observed, and cumulative effectiveness was evident in: (1) reduction in the number of incontinent episodes, (2) reduction in the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Urinary Incontinence-Short Form and International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms Quality of Life scores, (3) increased patients' global impression of improvement, and (4) improvement of PFMS. CONCLUSIONS Unsupervised B-PFMT programs improve outcomes relevant to UI and PFMS in midlife community women who have UI.

I argue that an account of the affective aspects of vulnerability can respond to two challenges related to theories of vulnerability. The first challenge is to offer a critique of vulnerability as an effect of harmful social formations while not assuming an account of vulnerable subjects as living lessened lives. The second challenge is to provide an improved understanding regarding how vulnerability may operate as an available affective resource for political subjects. Drawing on Deleuze and Guattari's philosophy, I assert that vulnerability is a dual affective relation. As an aspect of social precarity, vulnerability is the affective pattern that stems from affective encounters with power formations, which limit and hinder life. However, I assert that vulnerability is also an affective response that marks the micro vital connections of bodies as they allow transformation and creativity to surpass the limits of stable subject positions. This duality of vulnerability yields political significance as an affective navigating tool for political subjects.

A conjunctive belief rule-based clinical decision support system is proposed in this paper to identify critical and non-critical COVID-19 patients in hospitals using only three blood test markers. The experts’ knowledge of COVID-19 is encoded in the form of belief rules in the proposed method. To fine-tune the initial belief rules provided by COVID-19 experts using the real patient’s data, a modified differential evolution algorithm that can solve the constraint optimization problem of the belief rule base is also proposed in this paper. Several experiments are performed using 485 COVID-19 patients’ data to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed system. Experimental result shows that, after optimization, the conjunctive belief rule-based system achieved the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 0.954, 0.923, and 0.959, respectively, while for disjunctive belief rule base, they are 0.927, 0.769, and 0.948. Moreover, with a 98.85% AUC value, our proposed method shows superior performance than the four traditional machine learning algorithms: LR, SVM, DT, and ANN. All these results validate the effectiveness of our proposed method. The proposed system will help the hospital authorities to identify severe and non-severe COVID-19 patients and adopt optimal treatment plans in pandemic situations.","Ahmed, Faisal Hossain Mohammad Shahadat Islam Raihan Ul Andersson Karl",Applied Sciences,99,1

These events can have significant impacts on the interplay between poverty and social cohesion, i.e. how different groups in society interact and cooperate to survive and prosper. To that effect, this paper provides a theory-driven overview of how social responses to past epidemics and pandemics were determined by the epidemiological and non-epidemiological characteristics of these outbreaks, with a particular focus on the conditions giving rise to scapegoating and persecution of minority groups, including migrants. We discuss existing theories as well as historical and quantitative studies, and highlight the cases where epidemics and pandemics may lead to milder or more severe forms of scapegoating. Finally, we conclude with a summary of priorities for future research on epidemics, pandemics and social conflict and discuss the possible effects and policy implications of COVID-19.","Jedwab, Remi Khan Amjad M.; Russ, Jason Zaveri Esha D.",World Development,99,1

An online survey of 136 married couples was conducted during the lockdown caused by the spread of COVID-19 accompanied by family income losses. Frequency and severity of discussions on financial topics;level of subjective economic well-being, activity of coping strategies, family cohesion and adaptation were measured. Results showed that the discussion of financial topics is a stressor for married couples, accompanied by contradictions and conflicts, but ultimately helps to improve quality of relations between spouses, and also increases the adaptability of the family system in a situation of socioeconomic crisis. Subjects of conflicts were defined. Influence of gender roles on financial consciousness and behavior was shown. Wives are more likely to initiate discussions on economic topics and more inclined to economic anxiety, while husbands showed economic optimism. The severity of financial stress correlates with assessments of family cohesion. Correlations between financial wellbeing and coping behavior of husbands and wives represent the family as an entire open system. Partners are interdependent in overcoming financial stress. Collective family coping is determined by individual reactions of spouses. The efforts of partners can be congruent and complementary.","Yakymchuk, I. P.; Olkhovetskyi, S. M.; Rashkovska, I.

NavStick repurposes a game controller's thumbstick to allow VIPs to survey what is around them via line-of-sight. In a user study, we compare NavStick with traditional menu-based surveying for different navigation tasks and find that VIPs were able to form more accurate mental maps of their environment with NavStick than with menu-based surveying.

The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 is varied, and has been explored in many studies. there is still a need to quantify the extent of the risk of developing the severe clinical manifestations of COVID-19 that require admission to intensive care unit (ICU) and mechanical ventilation initiation. The present study aims to assess ICU admission among COVID-19 confirmed cases and those who required invasive mechanical ventilation. MEDLINE, Web of Science, and SCOPUS electronic databases were searched for epidemiological studies on confirmed cases of COVID-19 atthe end of April 2020. Eligible articles that reported on admission to ICUs and mechanical ventilation were included. A random-effects model was used to pool results. A total of 23 articles reported on a total of 6124 confirmed COVID-19 cases. The majority of included articles were from China. The proportion of all hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 who required ICU admission was between 0.01% to 53%, with the pooled proportion of 18% (95%CI 22,73%, I2 = 97.2%, p<0.001). The pooled proportion of ICU patients who had required invasive mechanical ventilation ranged from 4% to 94%, with the pooled estimate at 34%(95%CI 24 to 44%, I2 = 99%,p<0.001) Around a fifth of patients with confirmed COVID-19 diagnoses required admission to the ICU, and at least a third of those cases needed invasive mechanical ventilation.

We identified 2,004 plasma proteins in EA and 1,618 in AA, with majority overlapping, which showed significant genetic associations with common variants in cis-regions. Availability of AA sample led to smaller credible sets and identification of a significant number of population-specific cis-pQTLs. Estimates of cis-heritability for proteins were similar across EA and AA (median cis-h2=0.09 for EA and 0.10 for AA) and tended to be lower than those of gene expressions. Elastic-net-based algorithms produced high accuracy for protein prediction in each population, but models developed in AA were more transportable to EA than conversely.

The stigma associated with pain and opioid use has made it difficult for those with SCD to obtain needed treatment for pain, which can be acute or chronic, and nociceptive or neuropathic in nature. Given these difficulties, coupled with the inconsistency of opioids in successfully treating chronic and neuropathic pain, there is a need for non-opioid alternatives to treat this increasingly recognized subset of patients with SCD. Topical capsaicin for neuropathic pain has been studied extensively in adults with comparable efficacy to gabapentinoids, but it has not been investigated for SCD-related pain. We investigated the safety and feasibility of high dose (8%) topical capsaicin for treatment of neuropathic pain in children with SCD. The primary objective was to assess drug safety. Secondary objectives were to assess the feasibility and optimal utilization strategy of various measures of neuropathic and chronic pain states, and to obtain preliminary efficacy data. Prior to this study there has been very little published data regarding quantitative sensory testing as a trended datapoint to assess therapeutic effect on neuropathic pain. Methods Patients between ages 14-21 years with SCD and reported symptoms of neuropathic pain were included. During each of 7 visits scheduled at 6 week intervals, mechanical quantitative sensory testing (QST) was conducted using an electronic von Frey instrument (Bioseb) at a control site (thenar eminence) and the two most common sites of vaso-occlusive pain as reported at enrollment. Participants also completed the PainDETECT® questionnaire (Pfizer) for neuropathic pain assessment. During visits 1, 3, and 5 an 8% capsaicin patch was applied to the previously established most common site of pain. Safety was evaluated via CTCAE based analysis of adverse events in real time and at study completion. Efficacy was primarily evaluated by improvement in mechanical pain threshold at the site of most frequent pain (treated with capsaicin) relative to the 2nd most common site of pain (not treated). Trends in PainDetect scores also contributed to a preliminary understanding of capsaicin efficacy. Results 10 out of 13 patients approached (5 male, 5 female) were enrolled as planned within 8 weeks. 9 participants completed visits 1-5, and 7 completed visit 6 prior to study suspension due to COVID restrictions. There were no CTCAE grade 3 adverse events attributable to capsaicin. There were no vaso-occlusive pain crises triggered by a patch application. One participant requested that the second patch be removed early due to intolerance of the burning sensation associated with the patch. She subsequently did not have the third patch applied at visit 5. All participants were informed at enrollment of the likelihood of this side effect, which was nearly universal among participants but generally well tolerated. The other 9 participants completed all possible study activities and felt the second patch application was more tolerable than the first. 6 participants felt after 2 treatments the treated area was no longer their most common site of pain. These subjective reports were supported by more objective measures. The average difference in pain threshold as measured by QST between the two painful sites (QSTTreated - QSTuntreated) was used to evaluate a beneficial effect of capsaicin. This difference from visit 1 to visit 5 changed from -31.94g to +11.51g over the first 5 visits for an average improvement in pain threshold at the treated site relative to the untreated site of +43.45g (p=0.02) (Fig. 1), indicating that by visit 5 the threshold was higher at the treated site than the untreated site, a reversal from visit 1. Statistical analysis could not be completed for subsequent visits due to incomplete datasets. Conclusion Our pilot study indicates 8% topical capsaicin is safe and feasible for children with SCD. The data indicates this therapy may be efficacious in a eliorating neuropathic pain for this population and warrants further investigation in a follow-up efficacy study to be initiated in the coming months. The initial negative difference in QST values and subsequent trends between the two sites coincided with patient reported relative pain severity and supports the potential of QST as a tool in trending medication effect on peripheral hypersensitivity.

These decentralized initiatives sought to solve a low supply of medical inputs and individual protection devices by sharing these devices through online repositories. However, it is known that personal protective equipment may cause discomfort and pain in situations of prolonged use, even when they are designed and approved through traditional processes. In this context, this paper aims to analyze COVID-19-related protective equipment (PE) models and files shared in online repositories to understand to what extent aspects related to ergonomics, safety and manufacturing were considered in their design and sharing. This study takes an exploratory qualitative and comparative approach. The models’ analysis focused on their description and related information, looking specifically for mentions to ergonomics, safety and manufacturing (model printing and quality) aspects. One hundred models were analyzed, and of these, 60% presented information related to ergonomics and safety, while 80% presented information related to manufacturing. Specifically, the concern in describing the ergonomics and safety aspects was below those related to manufacturing, especially when considering the level of detail of this information. The findings show that developing and sharing solutions, in online, collaborative, and free to use platforms has a great potential to solve the lack of protective equipment, in face of extreme situations. However, this initiative should be better understood and directed to reduce possible comfort and effectiveness problems that may arise from poor information and design of the devices. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Souza, R.

COVID-19 has challenged sports teams to come up with reasonable and easy-to-implement solutions to provide a safe training environment for their players and staff. For this reason, proximity data is more important than ever, as many teams are in need of a way to measure social distancing and maintain contact tracing of their athletes. Bluetooth has been widely used to detect colocation and monitor social distancing. However, there are many other sensing technologies that may prove to be more accurate, robust, and secure. Therefore, the focus of this work is to investigate how Bluetooth compares with ultra-wideband and ultrasound technologies when monitoring the distance between users. We have implemented and compared the three modalities in a controlled experiment to investigate their accuracy at detecting distance between users at various levels. Our results indicate that the UWB signals are the most accurate at monitoring co-location. This is in-line with previous research suggesting that Bluetooth cannot accurately measure the distance between fast moving objects and needs about 20 seconds to stabilize distance measurements;therefore, it is not feasible to use for sports. In addition, we recorded that UWB models yielded an accuracy of over 95%, while ultrasound correctly classified the observations over 80% of the time, and Bluetooth had an accuracy of less than 50% when predicting if a given signal is within 6 feet or not. © 2021 IEEE.","Adam, S.; Coward, B.; Deberry, G.; Glazier, C.; Magnusson, E.; Boukhechba, M.","2021 IEEE Systems and Information Engineering Design Symposium, SIEDS 2021",99,1

Issues of quarantine legitimacy, criteria for quarantine, and the need to allow some quarantined healthcare workers to leave their homes to go to work were identified. Also important was the need to answer questions from people entering quarantine about the continuation of their wages, salaries, and other forms of income while they were not working, and about the means by which they would be supplied with groceries and other services necessary for daily living. The threat of enforcement had less effect on compliance than did the credibility of compliance-monitoring. Fighting boredom and other psychological stresses of quarantine, muting the forces of stigma against those in quarantine, and crafting and delivering effective and believable communications to a population of mixed cultures and languages also were critical. The need for officials to develop consistent quarantine policies, procedures, and public messages across jurisdictional boundaries was paramount.","DiGiovanni, Clete; Conley, Jerome; Chiu, Daniel; Zaborski, Jason","Biosecurity and bioterrorism : biodefense strategy, practice, and science",99,1

The expansion of the current H5N1 avian influenza enzootic and its incursion into human health presents a real and significant threat of an influenza pandemic. The world has for the first time an unprecedented opportunity for pandemic preparation. Current global efforts to tackle the H5N1 pandemic threat are centred around the framework of the International Health Regulations (2005) that requires countries to openly share disease intelligence including clinical samples, viruses and epidemiological information. Present international initiatives also seek to establish more equitable allocation and sharing mechanisms for developing countries, of therapeutic resources, public health interventions and other broad-based support in the event of a pandemic. To be sustainable, country preparatory efforts need to be integrated within wider national emergency preparedness frameworks and emphasise the strengthening of basic capacities in disease surveillance, outbreak response and health systems that can respond to a range of public health emergencies. Such capacity building represents permanent investments in health that will have enduring benefits beyond a pandemic.

While this is shifting somewhat, there remains a considerable need to address the underprioritization of mental health and well-being, perhaps even more so in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, given the history of mental health interventions-which have overemphasized the biomedical model and have thus resulted in coercion, denial of life in the community, and unnecessary pathologization of human experience-there is also a need to ensure that increased funding does not simply replicate these mistakes. This is particularly true in the current landscape, where efforts to ""scale up"" mental health and to reduce ""treatment gaps"" are gaining momentum and where post-pandemic responses are still being formulated. As the potential for global mechanisms for funding mental health increases, national and international funders should look to practices that are rights affirming and contextually relevant. In this paper, I explore the current landscape of mental health financing, in terms of both national resource allocation and development assistance. I then outline the momentum in global mental health that is likely to materialize through increased funding, before considering ways in which that funding might be utilized in a manner that promotes human rights.","Mahomed, Faraaz",Health and human rights,99,19

METHOD A classification of epilepsy using International League Against Epilepsy classification was made and an investigation of causes was carried out. RESULTS Of those 162 new patients diagnosed as having epilepsy in Bach Mai Hospital, Hanoi, Vietnam, from February 2002 to February 2004 (male 84, female 78), there were 58 cases of generalized epilepsy: 22 symptomatic and 36 idiopathic or cryptogenic. A total of 90 patients were diagnosed as having localization-related epilepsy: 53 as symptomatic and 37 as idiopathic or cryptogenic. A total of 14 cases were also considered as not epileptic after strict review of both the history and the examination data. CONCLUSION Concerning the causes, the following were noted: (i) the rate of infectious diseases and trauma as causes of epilepsy was considerably higher in Vietnam than in developed countries; (ii) certain infectious diseases could be prevented if vaccinations and public health knowledge were improved; and (iii) the number of trauma cases, mainly due to traffic accidents, would likely be reduced if the traffic system was improved.","Shirasaka, Yukiyoshi; Hinh, Le Duc; Minh, Phan Hong; Sato, Wakiro",Pediatrics international : official journal of the Japan Pediatric Society,99,9

This is achieved via specific receptors located on the surface of target cells, with ligand binding activating key intracellular signal transduction cascades to mediate the requisite cellular outcome. Effective resolution of receptor signaling is also essential, with excessive signaling having the potential for pathological consequences. The Suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) family of proteins represent one important mechanism to extinguish cytokine and growth factor receptor signaling. There are 8 SOCS proteins in mammals; SOCS1-7 and the alternatively named Cytokine-inducible SH2-containing protein (CISH). SOCS1-3 and CISH are predominantly associated with the regulation of cytokine receptor signaling, while SOCS4-7 are more commonly involved in the control of Receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling. Individual SOCS proteins are typically induced by specific cytokines and growth factors, thereby generating a negative feedback loop. As a consequence of their regulatory properties, SOCS proteins have important functions in development and homeostasis, with increasing recognition of their role in disease, particularly their tumor suppressor and anti-inflammatory functions. This review provides a synthesis of our current understanding of the SOCS family, with an emphasis on their immune and hematopoietic roles.","Trengove, Monique C; Ward, Alister C",American journal of clinical and experimental immunology,99,33

On March 24th 2020, the HULP launched a program of postpartum early discharge and home visit. The objective of this work was to detect if the care strategy ""Voluntary early discharge and home visit by the midwife (2nd year EIR)"" applied by the HULP during the COVID-19 pandemic had any adverse effect on the woman and/or the newborn. METHODS Cross-sectional observational descriptive study using convenience sampling among women included in the early discharge-home visit program from March 24th to May 5th 2020. 222 medical records and telephone surveys to postpartum women who complied with the inclusion criteria were analyzed. The statistical analysis was performed using SAS 9.4. RESULTS The average of inpatient time was 25 hours and 15 minutes. 8.6% of newborns were sent back to the HULP, and 2.2% were readmitted for hyperbilirubinemia. 2.3% of parents took their infants to the Emergency Care Unit, but only 0.46% needed readmission. 0.4% of postpartum women were readmitted. At the discharge, 84.2% of newborns exclusively breastfed. After one week of the birth, 73.4% of infants were exclusively breastfeeding, 18% were mixed breastfeeding, and 8.6% were bottle feeding. 89.6% of women believed early discharge was appropriate. Home visit was described as ""very satisfactory"" in 83.3% of cases, and the care provided, in 88.7% of cases. CONCLUSIONS With the early discharge-home visit program, continuity of care is provided, health problems were detected and resolved and high maternal satisfaction levels were obtained.","Feijóo-Iglesias, M Belén; Chicharro Chorro, Lilián; Ballester Escolar, Irene; Suárez Pascual, Amanda; De la Peña Rodríguez, Medea Aglaya; Alba Diego, Rosa María",Revista espanola de salud publica,99,16

We evaluated the use of the barbed suture for urethrovesical anastomosis (UVA) during robotic assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP). Time to completion of UVA, post-operative anastomotic leak rate, and urinary incontinence were compared in patients undergoing UVA with 3-0 unidirectional-barbed suture vs. 3-0 Monocryl™ (Ethicon, Somerville, NJ). MATERIALS AND METHODS Data were prospectively collected for 70 consecutive patients undergoing RALP for prostate cancer between November 2009 and October 2010. In the first 35 patients, the UVA was performed using a modified running van Velthoven anastomosis technique using two separate 3-0 monofilament sutures. In the subsequent 35 patients, the UVA was performed using two running novel unidirectional barbed sutures. At 7-12 days postoperatively, all patients were evaluated with a cystogram to determine anastomotic integrity. Urinary incontinence was assessed at two months and five months by total daily pad usage. Clinical symptoms suggestive of bladder neck contracture were elicited. RESULTS Age, PSA, Gleason score, prostate size, estimated blood loss, body mass index, and clinical and pathologic stage between the 2 groups were similar. Comparing the monofilament group and V-Loc™180 cohorts, average time to complete the anastomosis was similar (27.4 vs. 26.4 minutes, p = 0.73) as was the rate of urinary extravasation on cystogram (5.7 % vs. 8.6%, p = 0.65). There were no symptomatic bladder neck contractures noted at 5 months of follow-up. At 2 months, the percentage of patients using 2 or more pads per day was lower in the V-Loc™180 cohort (24% vs. 44%, p < 0.02). At 5 months, this difference was no longer evident. CONCLUSIONS Time to complete the UVA was similar in the intervention and control groups. Rates of urine leak were also comparable. While the V-Loc™180 was associated with improved early continence, this difference was transient.","Manganiello, Marc; Kenney, Patrick; Canes, David; Sorcini, Andrea; Moinzadeh, Alireza",International braz j urol : official journal of the Brazilian Society of Urology,99,23

In one approach, methylmercuric hydroxide-denatured genomic RNA was reverse-transcribed using as primer an oligonucleotide complementary to the 5' end of open reading frame (ORF) 1a. The first-strand cDNA was ligated with T4 RNA ligase to an oligonucleotide of which the 3' end was blocked. The ligated product was amplified by PCR, cloned and sequenced. In the second approach, untreated or decapped genomic RNA was ligated between the 3' and 5' ends, reverse-transcribed across the ligation junction and the product was amplified by PCR, cloned and sequenced. Both approaches yielded the same results, indicating that the 5' leader of LDV-P is 156 nucleotides long, inclusive of the 5' UAUAACC 3' sequence involved in the linkage of the 5' leader to the bodies of the seven subgenomic mRNAs of LDV. The 5' leader of LDV is about 50 nucleotides shorter than those of the related viruses, equine arteritis virus and Lelystad virus, but at least twice as long as the leaders of the coronaviruses. The finding that untreated LDV RNA was ligated 5' to 3' end as efficiently as RNA treated with decapping enzyme suggests that genomic LDV RNA may not possess a 5' cap but terminates with 5' phosphoryl-A.","Chen, Z; Faaberg, K S; Plagemann, P G",The Journal of general virology,99,1

In this study, we have demonstrated that under nonreducing conditions the N protein forms disulfide-linked homodimers. However, inclusion of an alkylating agent (N-ethylmaleimide [NEM]) prevented disulfide bond formation, suggesting that these intermolecular disulfide linkages were formed as a result of spurious oxidation during cell lysis. In contrast, N protein homodimers isolated from extracellular virions were shown to have formed NEM-resistant intermolecular disulfide linkages, the function of which is probably to impart stability to the virion. Pulse-chase analysis revealed that N protein homodimers become specifically disulfide linked within the virus-infected cell, albeit at the later stages of infection, conceivably when the virus particle buds into the oxidizing environment of the endoplasmic reticulum. Moreover, NEM-resistant disulfide linkages were shown to occur only during productive PRRSV infection, since expression of recombinant N protein did not result in the formation of NEM-resistant disulfide-linked homodimers. Mutational analysis indicated that of the three conserved cysteine residues in the N protein, only the cysteine at position 23 was involved in the formation of disulfide linkages. The N protein dimer was shown to be stable both in the presence and absence of intermolecular disulfide linkages, indicating that noncovalent interactions also play a role in dimerization. Non-disulfide-mediated N protein interactions were subsequently demonstrated both in vitro by the glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down assay and in vivo by the mammalian two-hybrid assay. Using a series of N protein deletion mutants fused to GST, amino acids 30 to 37 were shown to be essential for N-N interactions. Furthermore, since RNase A treatment markedly decreased N protein-binding affinity, it appears that at least in vitro, RNA may be involved in bridging N-N interactions. In cross-linking experiments, the N protein was shown to assemble into higher-order structures, including dimers, trimers, tetramers, and pentamers. Together, these findings demonstrate that the N protein possesses self-associative properties, and these likely provide the basis for PRRSV nucleocapsid assembly.","Wootton, Sarah K; Yoo, Dongwan",Journal of virology,99,16

Background Growing number of confirmed and deaths cases from the coronavirus worldwide, particularly in Italy, Iran and South Korea, has resulted concerns about the future of these countries and their deterioration. Also the European region is likely to face more casualties due to the delay in the virus reaching most of its regions and, of course, as the trend continues. Methods We conducted a simulation in both current and ideal situation for the next month to predict the death rate and examine the reason for the difference in Italy, Iran and South Korea individually. If we assume the cultural and political factors and age pyramids distribution are similar across regions, the differences are mainly due either to the heavier health-care burden owing to the larger population or to the medical facilities diversities. Results Our results for Italy showed higher death number, but the rate would be more for Iran. South Korea is also expected to have a smaller increase in the number of confirmed cases and deaths compared to Iran and Italy by the next month.

The disease course is unpredictable with periods of exacerbation and remission, thus having a significant impact on the mental health and quality of life (QOL). We evaluated the prevalence of anxiety and depression and their association with disease severity, QOL and their associated factors in adolescents (≥ 13 years old) and adults with AD. METHODS A cross-sectional study was conducted involving patients aged ≥ 13 years with AD who fulfilled the Hanifin and Rajka diagnostic criteria. These patients were recruited from Hospital Queen Elizabeth, Kota Kinabalu and Hospital Kuala Lumpur between January 2020 to March 2021. Assessment instruments used were Scoring for Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD), Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM), Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). RESULTS Of the 217 participants, 75 (34.6%) had mild eczema, 116 (53.5%) moderate eczema and 26 (12.0%) severe eczema with a mean SCORAD score of 30.4 (standard deviation [SD] = 4.70). Twenty-six (12.0%) and 17 (7.8%) had anxiety and depression, respectively. Patients with moderate to severe disease reported higher HADS-A (HADS-anxiety component), HADS-D (HADS-depression component), POEM, DLQI, itch, sleep loss and skin pain scores (p < 0.001 for all). Severe sleep loss (adjusted odd ratio [AOR] 12.41, p < 0.001) and hospitalisation in the past year (AOR 6.44, p = 0.004) were significant predictors for anxiety whereas those aged 41 to 60 (AOR 10.83, p = 0.020), having severe skin pain (AOR 6.12, p = 0.028), DLQI ≥ 10 (AOR 5.27, p = 0.002) and history of hospitalisation in the past year (AOR 12.73, p = 0.002) had increased risk for depression. CONCLUSION The prevalence of anxiety was 12.0% while depression was 7.8% in our cohort. AD renders a significant burden on mental health and QOL with a higher impact on those with more severe disease. The use of screening tools such as HADS and DLQI for assessment of mental health and QOL should be considered to address the multidimensional burden of AD.","Tan, W F; Voo, S Y M; Sulaiman, N; Robinson, S",The Medical journal of Malaysia,99,33

Currently, no specific prophylaxis or treatment is available for CoV infections. Therefore we investigated the virucidal and antiviral potential of Echinacea purpurea (Echinaforce®) against human coronavirus (HCoV) 229E, highly pathogenic MERS- and SARS-CoVs, as well as the newly identified SARS-CoV-2, in vitro. METHODS: To evaluate the antiviral potential of the extract, we pre-treated virus particles and cells and evaluated remaining infectivity by limited dilution. Furthermore, we exposed cells to the extract after infection to further evaluate its potential as a prophylaxis and treatment against coronaviruses. We also determined the protective effect of Echinaforce® in re-constituted nasal epithelium. RESULTS: In the current study, we found that HCoV-229E was irreversibly inactivated when exposed to Echinaforce® at 3.2 µg/ml IC50. Pre-treatment of cell lines, however, did not inhibit infection with HCoV-229E and post-infection treatment had only a marginal effect on virus propagation at 50 µg/ml. However, we did observe a protective effect in an organotypic respiratory cell culture system by exposing pre-treated respiratory epithelium to droplets of HCoV-229E, imitating a natural infection. The observed virucidal activity of Echinaforce® was not restricted to common cold coronaviruses, as both SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoVs were inactivated at comparable concentrations. Finally, the causative agent of COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 was also inactivated upon treatment with 50µg/ml Echinaforce®. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that Echinaforce® is virucidal against HCoV-229E, upon direct contact and in an organotypic cell culture model.

Based on the Italian Ministry of Health data, we reconstructed the daily course of virus-positive cases and deaths over March 2020 for the whole of Italy, 19 regions and 2 provinces. From 29 February to 31 March, there was a 100.9-fold increase in the cumulative number of cases and a 428.6-fold increase in the number of deaths in Italy. When plotted on a semilogarithmic scale, the curves tended to diverge from linearity with 23%, 16%, and 7% average daily increases during the three decades of March. Similarly, the number of deaths decreased from an average daily growth of 19% over the second decade to 10% over the third decade. The correlation coefficients relating the days to cases or deaths over each one of the three decades approached unity. As inferred from the equations of the regression lines relative to the three decades, the doubling times of cases were 3.4, 5.1, and 9.6 days, respectively. The doubling times of deaths over the second and third decades were 4.9 and 7.0 days, respectively. There was a broad geographic variability, with a striking gradient from the North, where 40.8% of cases and 57.9% of deaths occurred in Lombardy, to the South. On the whole, over March there was a trend to epidemic growth decline but the time for the end of the epidemic will depend on a variety of factors and, at present, it is unpredictable.","La Maestra, Sebastiano; Abbondandolo, Angelo; De Flora, Silvio",J Med Virol,99,20

The negative pressure inside the hood is generated by a fan-filter-unit (FFU) through which infectious aerosols from a patient are filtered. The outside area is kept clean which decreases the risk of nosocomial infections in hospital wards. We tried new applications of the hood. Methods: The negative pressure hood was newly applied in an intensive care unit (ICU) as a place where a staff performs the practice of suctioning that generates much aerosol from the patient, as well as a waiting space for patients. Furthermore, the possibility that the hood can be converted to a positive pressure hood as a clean hood by switching the airflow direction of FFU was assessed. The cleaning efficacy of the inside of the hood was tested using an aerosolized cultured influenza virus tracer and an optimal airflow rate was determined according to the test results. Results: The hood, named Barrihood, was found to be competent to be used (I) for tracheal suctioning in ICU, (II) as a waiting space for a child in a nursery who suddenly showed symptoms of the disease and waiting to be picked-up by the guardian, and (III) as a waiting space in a special outpatient clinic in a hospital for COVID-19 suspected cases to prevent dissemination of airborne pathogens. The positive pressure hood was also competent in keeping clean air quality that meets the standard class 100 of NASA's bio-clean room category. Conclusions: The proposed new applications will broaden the range of the hood's usage. The isolation hood could be useful in many settings to protect people outside the hood from a patient inside, or to protect an individual inside from air particles outside the hood, such as airborne pathogens, allergens, or hazardous particulate matter like PM2.5.","Nishimura, Hidekazu; Fan, Yuxuan; Sakata, Soichiro",J Thorac Dis,99,12

We conducted a large-scale general population study using data from a community-dwelling sample in England (n = 334,329; 56.4 ±8.1 y; 54.5% women) with prospective linkage to national registry on hospitalization for COVID-19. Body mass index (BMI, from measured height and weight) was used as an indicator of overall obesity, and waist-hip ratio for central obesity. Main outcome was cases of COVID-19 serious enough to warrant a hospital admission from 16 March 2020 to 26 April 2020. Around 0.2% (n = 640) of the sample were hospitalized for COVID-19. There was an upward linear trend in the likelihood of COVID-19 hospitalization with increasing BMI, that was evident in the overweight (odds ratio, 1.39; 95% CI 1.13 to 1.71; crude incidence 19.1 per 10,000) and obese stage I (1.70;1.34 to 2.16; 23.3 per 10,000) and stage II (3.38; 2.60 to 4.40; 42.7 per 10,000) compared to normal weight (12.5 per 10,000). This gradient was little affected after adjustment for a wide range of covariates; however, controlling for biomarkers, particularly high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and glycated hemoglobin, led to a greater degree of attenuation. A similar pattern of association emerged for waist-hip ratio. In summary, overall and central obesity are risk factors for COVID-19 hospital admission. Elevated risk was apparent even at modest weight gain. The mechanisms may involve impaired glucose and lipid metabolism.","Hamer, Mark; Gale, Catharine R; Kivimäki, Mika; Batty, G David",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,99,10

Hence, we sought to describe the clinical characteristics of dialysis patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. METHODS: We reviewed clinical outcomes, which consisted of clinical data extracted from the medical records of 695 registered dialysis patients at the Dialysis Center of Central Hospital of Wuhan from January 13th, 2020, to February 29th, 2020, and performed statistical analysis. According to the results, there were 447, 227 and 21 hemodialysis (HD), peritoneal dialysis (PD) and combined HD and PD (HD&PD) cases, respectively. RESULTS: During the outbreak of COVID-19, 36 dialysis patients were infected by SARS-CoV-2. Among those 36 patients, 32 (7.2%) were on HD, and 4 (1.8%) were on PD. When comparing SARS-CoV-2 infection between HD and PD, the relative risk was 4.07 (RR = 4.07, 95% CI 1.46-11.35). We noted a median age of 66 years during the observation period, and the number of male patients was 23 (63.9%). There were 15 fatal cases tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (13 cases on HD and 2 cases on PD). By comparing mortality in the same period of 2018, 2019 and 2020, the all-cause mortality of hemodialysis patients was significantly higher in 2020 (4.89%) than in either 2018 (2.55%) or 2019 (1.97%). There was no significant difference in mortality from all causes excluding COVID-19, during the same period among the 3-year period. However, during the COVID-19 outbreak, the mortality from all causes excluding COVID-19 was 2.73%, which was slightly higher than that from COVID-19 (2.16%). CONCLUSIONS: Although COVID-19 seriously threatens the health of people with uremia, deaths from all causes excluding COVID-19 during the epidemic cannot be ignored.","Zeng, Xingruo; Huang, Xiaomei; Xu, Li; Xiao, Jianwei; Gu, Lianqing; Wang, Yin; Tuo, Yanhong; Fang, Xun; Wang, Wenzhe; Li, Ni; Xiao, Wei; Yang, Yan; Gong, Pengju; Song, Wenjing; Gao, Jingbo; He, Xin; Huang, Sirui; Zeng, Yifan; Wei, Lei; Chen, Wenli",Int. urol. nephrol,99,14

Effective screening methods are awaited. We performed a prospective study to evaluate the impact of musculature and breathing-swallowing discoordination on the exacerbation of COPD with a novel swallowing monitor using a piezoelectric sensor. Patients and Methods: This was the second part of a prospective study of patients with COPD from the Iizuka COPD cohort. Seventy patients with stable COPD underwent dysphagia screening, skeletal muscle mass index (SMI) and tongue pressure measurements, and swallowed 3 mL and 30 mL of water while wearing a swallowing monitor. Patients were followed for one year. Results: During the follow-up period, 28 patients experienced exacerbations (E group), and 42 had none (non-E group). There was no significant difference in tongue pressure measurements between the two groups. The SMI in the E group was significantly lower than that in the non-E group. Among the swallowing monitor measurements, the 3 mL I-SW% (the percentage of swallows in which inspiration preceded the swallow [out of ten 3 mL swallows]) was significantly lower in the E group than in the non-E group. Conclusion: Breathing-swallowing coordination is an independent factor related to the exacerbation of COPD. Not only the presence of discoordination but also the inability to produce an airway protection mechanism may contribute to more frequent aspiration and exacerbations.","Yoshimatsu, Yuki; Tobino, Kazunori; Nagami, Shinsuke; Yagi, Naomi; Oku, Yoshitaka",Int J Chron Obstruct Pulmon Dis,99,20

WHO-recommended, trivalent vaccine components were lineage-mismatched for B. The I-MOVE hospital network measured 2017-18 seasonal influenza vaccine effectiveness (IVE) against influenza A(H3N2) and B among hospitalised patients (&#8805;65 years) in Europe. METHODS: Following the same generic protocol for test-negative design, hospital teams in nine countries swabbed patients &#8805;65 years with recent onset (&#8804;7 days) severe acute respiratory infection (SARI), collecting information on demographics, vaccination status and underlying conditions. Cases were RT-PCR positive for influenza A(H3N2) or B; controls: negative for any influenza. ""Vaccinated"" patients had SARI onset >14 days after vaccination. We measured pooled IVE against influenza, adjusted for study site, age, sex, onset date and chronic conditions. RESULTS: We included 3483 patients: 376 influenza A(H3N2) and 928 B cases, and 2028 controls. Most (>99%) vaccinated patients received the B lineage-mismatched trivalent vaccine. IVE against influenza A(H3N2) was 24% (95% CI: 2 to 40); 35% (95% CI: 6 to 55) in 65- to 79-year-olds and 14% (95% CI: -22 to 39) in &#8805;80-year-olds. Against influenza B, IVE was 30% (95% CI: 16 to 41); 37% (95% CI: 19 to 51) in 65- to 79-year-olds and 19% (95% CI: -7 to 38) in &#8805;80-year-olds. CONCLUSIONS: IVE against influenza B was similar to A(H3N2) in hospitalised older adults, despite trivalent vaccine and circulating B lineage mismatch, suggesting some cross-protection. IVE was lower in those &#8805;80 than 65-79 years. We reinforce the importance of influenza vaccination in older adults as, even with a poorly matched vaccine, it still protects one in three to four of this population from severe influenza.","Rose, Angela M C; Kissling, Esther; Gherasim, Alin; Casado, Itziar; Bella, Antonino; Launay, Odile; Lazar, Mihaela; Marbus, Sierk; Kuliese, Monika; Syrjänen, Ritva; Machado, Ausenda; Kurecic Filipovic, Sanja; Larrauri, Amparo; Castilla, Jesús; Alfonsi, Valeria; Galtier, Florence; Ivanciuc, Alina; Meijer, Adam; Mickiene, Aukse; Ikonen, Niina; Gómez, Verónica; Lovric Makaric, Zvjezdana; Moren, Alain; Valenciano, Marta",Influenza Other Respir Viruses,99,12

Here, we retrospectively evaluated and integrated laboratory parameters of 45 elderly subjects from a long-term care facility with Sars-CoV-2 outbreak and spread, to identify potential common patterns of systemic response able to better stratify patients' clinical course and outcome. METHODS: Baseline white blood cells, granulocytes', lymphocytes', and platelets' counts, hemoglobin, total iron, ferritin, D-dimer, and interleukin-6 concentration were used to generate a principal component analysis. Statistical analysis was performed by using R statistical package version 4.0. RESULTS: We identified 3 laboratory patterns of response, renamed as low-risk, intermediate-risk, and high-risk, strongly associated with patients' survival (p < 0.01). D-dimer, iron status, lymphocyte/monocyte count represented the main markers discriminating high- and low-risk groups.

Chronic exposure to air pollutants have been associated with lung ACE-2 over-expression which is known to be the main receptor for SARS-CoV-2. The aim of this study was to analyse the relationship between air pollutants concentration (PM 2.5 and NO2) and COVID-19 outbreak, in terms of transmission, number of patients, severity of presentation and number of deaths. METHODS: COVID-19 cases, ICU admissions and mortality rate were correlated with severity of air pollution in the Italian regions. RESULTS: The highest number of COVID-19 cases were recorded in the most polluted regions with patients presenting with more severe forms of the disease requiring ICU admission. In these regions, mortality was two-fold higher than the other regions. CONCLUSIONS: From the data available we propose a ""double-hit hypothesis"": chronic exposure to PM 2.5 causes alveolar ACE-2 receptor overexpression. This may increase viral load in patients exposed to pollutants in turn depleting ACE-2 receptors and impairing host defences. High atmospheric NO2 may provide a second hit causing a severe form of SARS-CoV-2 in ACE-2 depleted lungs resulting in a worse outcome.","Frontera, Antonio; Cianfanelli, Lorenzo; Vlachos, Konstantinos; Landoni, Giovanni; Cremona, George",J. infect,99,24

Despite an overall expansion of medical indications for labor induction, there is little international consensus regarding the criteria for induction, or for the recommended methods among nulliparous women. In this light, we assessed variations in the practice of induction of labor among 21 birth units in a nationwide cohort of women with no prior vaginal birth. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We carried out a prospective observational pilot study of women with induced labor and no prior vaginal birth, across 21 Norwegian birth units. We registered induction indications, methods and outcomes from 1 September to 31 December 2018 using a web-based case record form. Women were grouped into ""Nulliparous term cephalic"", ""Previous cesarean section"" and ""Other Robson"" (Robson groups 6, 7, 8 or 10). RESULTS: More than 98% of eligible women (n=1818) were included and a wide variety of methods was used for induction of labor. In nulliparous term cephalic pregnancies, cesarean section rates ranged from 11.1% to 40.6% between birth units, whereas in the previous cesarean section group, rates ranged from 22.7% to 67.5%. The indications ""large fetus"" and ""other fetal"" indications were associated with the highest cesarean rates. Failed inductions and failure to progress in labor contributed most to the cesarean rates. Uterine rupture occurred in two women (0.11%), both in the previous cesarean section group. In neonates, 1.6% had Apgar <7 at 5 minutes, and 0.4% had an umbilical artery pH <7.00. CONCLUSIONS: Cesarean rates and applied methods for induction of labor varied widely in this nationwide cohort of women without a prior vaginal birth. Neonatal outcomes were similar to those of normal birth populations. Results could indicate the need to move towards more standardized induction protocols associated with optimal outcomes for mother and baby.","Sørbye, Ingvil K; Oppegaard, Kevin S; Weeks, Andrew; Marsdal, Kjersti; Jacobsen, Anne F",Acta obstet. gynecol. scand,99,16

Surfactant has good surface or interface activity and can destroy the cell membrane of microorganisms. In this study, the surfactant SDS was used to artificially destroy the cell membrane of Corynebacterium glutamicum, increase the permeability of the cell membrane, and increase the ability of the strain to secrete L-isoleucine. This is the first time that surfactants have been applied to the fermentation of Corynebacterium glutamicum. Results indicated that after optimization, the output of L-isoleucine reached 43.67 g/L, which was 13.01% higher than that without sodium dodecyl sulfate. The yield of the by-products, such as valine, leucine, and alanine, was reduced by 72.30%, 64.30%, 71.70%, respectively.

Desde o início dessa agressão até os dias atuais, pretos e pardos são vítimas das desigualdades sociais e econômicas, mesmo com a abolição da escravatura. Vemos que o Estado não ofereceu apoio para essa população ser integrada na sociedade, e, por isso, boa parte vive à margem atualmente. Objetivo: Apontar as problemáticas que envolvem a população negra, analisar o contexto da pandemia de Sars-Cov-2 no processo de vulnerabilidade desse grupo, destacar a situação do ensino de pretos e pardos na educação médica e refletir sobre o cuidado em saúde de pessoas negras. Desenvolvimento: Existem algumas teorias sociais que tentam colocar a população negra como um grupo humano distinto dos demais e intelectualmente inferior na sociedade, justificando a marginalização e condição de desumanidade imposta a este. O reconhecimento do racismo no cuidado em saúde fez surgir, em 2009, a Política Nacional de Saúde Integral da População Negra (PNSIPN) que visa explicitar as iniquidades impostas a esta população e delinear metas para a educação de profissionais e a produção de cuidado, objetivando o combate ao racismo institucional na saúde. Com a pandemia do Sars-Cov-2 em 2020, a vulnerabilidade fica à mostra, assim como a invisibilidade que damos à questão raça/cor na formação médica. Assim, faz-se necessária a discussão transversal da relação raça/cor no ambiente de construção de conhecimento, como destacam as Diretrizes Curriculares Nacionais (DCN) voltadas para os cursos de Medicina. O ambiente educacional do curso ainda é ocupado, em sua maioria, por pessoas brancas, tanto educandos quanto educadores. Conclusão: A pandemia da Covid-19 coloca em evidência o racismo estrutural e institucional na saúde, assim como o silenciamento do racismo como determinante do processo saúde e adoecimento na formação dos atuais e futuros profissionais de saúde. Para uma produção de cuidado anti-racista, precisamos entender como a questão raça/cor relaciona-se com a saúde da população.","Borret, Rita Helena; Araujo, Dagles Henrique Sartori de; Belford, Pollyanna Silva; Oliveira, Denize Ornelas Pereira Salvador de; Vieira, Renata Carneiro; Teixeira, Débora Silva",Rev. bras. educ. méd,99,20

The household transmissibility of the causative pathogen, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), remains unclear. We aimed to estimate the secondary attack rate of SARS-CoV-2 among household and non-household close contacts in Guangzhou, China, using a statistical transmission model. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we used a comprehensive contact tracing dataset from the Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention to estimate the secondary attack rate of COVID-19 (defined as the probability that an infected individual will transmit the disease to a susceptible individual) among household and non-household contacts, using a statistical transmission model. We considered two alternative definitions of household contacts in the analysis: individuals who were either family members or close relatives, such as parents and parents-in-law, regardless of residential address, and individuals living at the same address regardless of relationship. We assessed the demographic determinants of transmissibility and the infectivity of COVID-19 cases during their incubation period. FINDINGS: Between Jan 7, 2020, and Feb 18, 2020, we traced 195 unrelated close contact groups (215 primary cases, 134 secondary or tertiary cases, and 1964 uninfected close contacts). By identifying households from these groups, assuming a mean incubation period of 5 days, a maximum infectious period of 13 days, and no case isolation, the estimated secondary attack rate among household contacts was 12·4% (95% CI 9·8-15·4) when household contacts were defined on the basis of close relatives and 17·1% (13·3-21·8) when household contacts were defined on the basis of residential address. Compared with the oldest age group (&#8805;60 years), the risk of household infection was lower in the youngest age group (<20 years; odds ratio [OR] 0·23 [95% CI 0·11-0·46]) and among adults aged 20-59 years (OR 0·64 [95% CI 0·43-0·97]). Our results suggest greater infectivity during the incubation period than during the symptomatic period, although differences were not statistically significant (OR 0·61 [95% CI 0·27-1·38]). The estimated local reproductive number (R) based on observed contact frequencies of primary cases was 0·5 (95% CI 0·41-0·62) in Guangzhou. The projected local R, had there been no isolation of cases or quarantine of their contacts, was 0·6 (95% CI 0·49-0·74) when household was defined on the basis of close relatives. INTERPRETATION: SARS-CoV-2 is more transmissible in households than SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. Older individuals (aged &#8805;60 years) are the most susceptible to household transmission of SARS-CoV-2. In addition to case finding and isolation, timely tracing and quarantine of close contacts should be implemented to prevent onward transmission during the viral incubation period.

Asymptomatic patients have been described as potential sources of transmission. However, there are difficulties to detect them and to establish their role in the dynamics of virus transmission, which hinders the implementation of prevention strategies. Objective: To describe the behavior of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 virus infection in a cohort of workers at the El Dorado ""Luis Carlos Galán Sarmiento"" International Airport in Bogotá, Colombia. Materials and methods: A prospective cohort of 212 workers from the El Dorado airport was designed. The follow-up began in June, 2020. A survey was used to characterize health and work conditions. Every 21 day, a nasopharyngeal swab was taken to identify the presence of SARS-CoV-2 using RT-PCR. We analyzed the behavior of the cycle threshold (ORF1ab and N genes) according to the day of follow-up. Results: In the first three follow-ups of the cohort, we found an incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection of 16.51%. The proportion of positive contacts was 14.08%. The median threshold for cycle threshold was 33.53. Conclusion: We characterized the asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in a cohort of workers.

This review describes the characteristics of asymptomatic carriers, potentials for asymptomatic transmission and its implications on mitigation strategies. Methods: PubMed database was searched to identify studies conducted in humans and published in the English language. Snowball search was also conducted on Google Scholar and the reference list of selected studies was checked to identify additional studies. Articles published from the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in December 2019 to September 2020 were considered for inclusion. Results: Three types of asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers were identified including pre-symptomatic cases, asymptomatic carriers with normal chest radiographs and asymptomatic carriers with abnormal chest radiographs. Pre-symptomatic cases are older and have abnormal chest radiograph and abnormal biochemical parameters including abnormal white blood cell and lymphocyte counts at the time of diagnosis compared to those who remain asymptomatic. Asymptomatic carriers with normal chest CT images constitute about one-third of all asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers. They are younger and have normal biochemical parameters at the time of diagnosis. Asymptomatic patients with abnormal chest radiograph represent about two-thirds of asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers. Limited data indicate that asymptomatic COVID-19 transmission is possible. Asymptomatic transmission has been reported among familial contacts of carriers. Asymptomatic transmission occur in both cases with normal and abnormal chest radiograph as well as those who have no obvious changes in biochemical parameters. Asymptomatic COVID-19 transmission varied in severity ranging from mild to severe infection. Conclusions: Evidence demonstrates that asymptomatic carriers contribute to the transmission of COVID-19 and have potential implications on community and healthcare transmissions including dialysis and long-term care facilities, as well as blood transfusion-related transmission. Mitigation measures should take into consideration the potential role of asymptomatic transmission.","Abubakar, U.; Hammad, M.",Value in Health,99,26

Organisational objectives can be efficiently achieved when employees are willing to do work that is beyond their job description. Organisations with employees with high organisational citizenship behaviour have a competitive advantage and are highly productive Research purpose: The study investigated the influence of compensation and training and development on organisational citizenship behaviour amongst academic staff at a rural-based South African institution of higher learning. Motivation for the study: Research on the influence of compensation and training and development on organisational citizenship behaviour is not new. However, the studies were carried out in different sectors outside South Africa. There is still scant information known about citizenship behaviour in the higher education sector in general and in South African rural-based institutions of higher learning in particular. Research approach/design and method: The study was based on a quantitative approach, which used a cross-sectional research design. A sample of 152 academic staff participated in this study. Data were gathered using a self-administered questionnaire. Descriptive statistics, correlation and multiple regression analysis technique were conducted using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 26.0. Main findings: The findings revealed a significant relationship between compensation and organisational citizenship behaviour. A significant correlation was also found between training and development and organisational citizenship behaviour. However, in multiple regression analysis, compensation was found to be the only predictor of organisational citizenship behaviour. Moreover, no significant difference in levels of organisational citizenship behaviour between men and women was found. Practical/managerial implications: The management of the institution should continuously review its compensation or rewards policies to enhance organisational citizenship behaviour amongst the academic staff. Institutions of higher learning should also compensate their employees and develop them fairly regardless of gender in order to promote organisational citizenship behaviour. Contribution/value-add: The study’s findings will assist the university management in making strategic decisions on compensation systems and staff development that will enhance the citizenship behaviour of the academic staff.","Manenzhe, Portia M.; Ngirande, Hlanganipai",SA Journal of Industrial Psychology,99,26

FETP graduates have contributed significantly to improvements in surveillance systems, control of infectious diseases, and outbreak investigations in the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR). OBJECTIVE: Considering the instrumental roles of FETP graduates during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) crisis, this study aimed to assess their awareness and preparedness to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic in three EMR countries. METHODS: An online survey was sent to FETP graduates in the EMR in March 2020. The FETP graduates were contacted by email and requested to fill out an online survey. Sufficient number of responses were received from only three countries-Jordan, Sudan, and Yemen. A few responses were received from other countries, and therefore, they were excluded from the analysis. The questionnaire comprised a series of questions pertaining to sociodemographic characteristics, knowledge of the epidemiology of COVID-19, and preparedness to respond to COVID-19. RESULTS: This study included a total of 57 FETP graduates (20 from Jordan, 13 from Sudan, and 24 from Yemen). A total of 31 (54%) graduates had attended training on COVID-19, 29 (51%) were members of a rapid response team against COVID-19, and 54 (95%) had previous experience in response to disease outbreaks or health emergencies. The vast majority were aware of the main symptoms, mode of transmission, high-risk groups, and how to use personal protective equipment. A total of 46 (81%) respondents considered themselves well prepared for the COVID-19 outbreak, and 40 (70%) reported that they currently have a role in supporting the country's efforts in the management of COVID-19 outbreak. CONCLUSIONS: The FETP graduates in Jordan, Sudan, and Yemen were fully aware of the epidemiology of COVID-19 and the safety measures required, and they are well positioned to investigate and respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, they should be properly and efficiently utilized by the Ministries of Health to investigate and respond to the current COVID-19 crisis where the needs are vastly growing and access to outside experts is becoming limited.","Al Nsour, Mohannad; Khader, Yousef; Al Serouri, Abdulwahed; Bashier, Haitham; Osman, Shahd",JMIR Med Educ,99,25

analysis of how university educators experience the shift to increasing online teaching in 2019 We explore what it means to be an online educator in contemporary higher education and aim to raise questions about how we approach online education and understand ourselves as educators, informed by a sociomaterial lens The research utilised collaborative autoethnography (CAE) to facilitate meaning‐making and uncover complex perspectives through collaboration and conversation This enabled us to question what we as educators were losing and what we were gaining as a consequence of shifting to more online modes of teaching via university mandated platforms and processes Through this methodology, various themes emerged: the role of corporeality;how we constructed ourselves through texts;how others materialised us in virtual spaces;the experience of online time;and our transforming practices and identities This paper provides a snapshot of a significant cultural milieu in academia as we were afforded time to engage in reflexive practice about teaching online just as the academic world was abruptly mandated to shift almost wholly online It also provides unique insights into the significance of understanding ourselves as both embodied and social, and the importance of community within academia Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Higher education's shift online, both before and during COVID, has had a substantial effect on university staff, including discomfort and loss of agency What this paper adds Considering the material and embodied is important in online education, particularly because it can be taken‐for‐granted and hence overlooked Feelings of disconnection can result from the inevitable gap between how educators represent themselves online and how others perceive (“materialise”) them online Experiencing a lack of connection with online students provides the opportunity to question assumptions about student experiences and develop more nuanced online teaching practice Teaching requires some kind of reconciliation between the linear time as laid out in learning design and the not‐yet‐here/always‐there time of online learning Implications for practice and/or policy Attention must continue to be paid to the experiences of educators as even experienced ones find teaching online disturbs identities and

material and embodied is important in online education, particularly because it can be taken‐for‐granted and hence overlooked Feelings of disconnection can result from the inevitable gap between how educators represent themselves online and how others perceive (“materialise”) them online Experiencing a lack of connection with online students provides the opportunity to question assumptions about student experiences and develop more nuanced online teaching practice Teaching requires some kind of reconciliation between the linear time as laid out in learning design and the not‐yet‐here/always‐there time of online learning Implications for practice and/or policy Attention must continue to be paid to the experiences of educators as even experienced ones find teaching online disturbs identities and practices Collegially sharing virtual spaces may assist university educators in making sense of the shifts demanded by online teaching and allow more active modelling of

Increasing data indicate that the disease presents in a severe form in patients with pre-existing chronic conditions like cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, respiratory system diseases, and renal diseases. This indicates that these patients seem to be more susceptible to COVID-19 and have higher mortality rates compared to patients with no comorbid conditions. Several factors can explain the heightened susceptibility to and fatal presentation of COVID-19 in these patients, for example, the enhanced expression of the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 receptor (ACE2) in specific organs, cytokine storm, and drug interactions contribute to the increased morbidity and mortality. Adding to the findings that individuals with pre-existing conditions may be more susceptible to COVID-19, it has also been shown that COVID-19 can induce chronic diseases in previously healthy patients. Therefore, understanding the interlinked relationship between COVID-19 and chronic diseases helps in optimizing the management of susceptible patients. This review comprehensively described the molecular mechanisms that contribute to worse COVID-19 prognosis in patients with pre-existing comorbidities such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, gastrointestinal and renal diseases, blood disorders, autoimmune diseases and finally, obesity. It also focused on how COVID-19 could, in some cases, lead to chronic conditions as a result of long-term multi-organ damage. Lastly, this work carefully discusses the tailored management plans for each specific patient population, aiming to achieve the best therapeutic outcome with minimum complications.","Alyammahi, Shatha K; Abdin, Shifaa M; Alhamad, Dima W; Elgendy, Sara M; Altell, Amani T; Omar, Hany A",Infect Genet Evol,99,5

However, diabetes (DM) as one of the most common comorbidities is rarely studied in detail. This study is aimed at describing clinical characteristics and determining risk factors of ICU admission for COVID-19 patients with DM. Methods: Data were extracted from 288 adult patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital. Demographic characteristics, laboratory results, radiographic findings, complications, and treatments were collected and compared between DM and non-DM groups. Binary logistic regression was used to identify the risk factors associated with ICU admission for COVID-19 patients with DM or non-DM. Results: COVID-19 patients with DM showed as older ages, higher levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), myoglobin, alanine transaminase (ALT), and aspartate transaminase (AST). They were also more prone to transfer to the intensive care unit (ICU) for treatment. Multiple regression analysis showed that the following were the independent risk factors for COVID-19 patients with DM that received ICU admission: each 1-year increase in age (odds ratio (OR), 1.07; 95% CI, 1.02-1.13; P = 0.007), respiratory rate over 24 times per minute (OR, 5.22; 95% CI, 2.26-16.58; P = 0.016), HbA1c greater than 7% (OR, 4.58; 95% CI, 1.82-10.55; P = 0.012), and AST higher than 40 U/L (OR, 2.96; 95% CI, 1.58-8.85; P = 0.022). In addition, each 1-year increase in age (OR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.01-1.10; P = 0.006), diarrhea (OR, 4.62; 95% CI, 2.01-9.36; P = 0.022), respiratory rate over 24 times per minute (OR, 5.13; 95% CI, 1.18-16.82; P = 0.035), CRP greater than 10 mg/L (OR, 5.19; 95% CI, 1.37-13.25, P = 0.009), and TnI higher than 0.03 µg/L (OR, 6.48; 95% CI, 1.17-21.38; P = 0.036) were risk factors for ICU admission of COVID-19 patients with non-DM. Conclusions: The older age, respiratory rate over 24 times per minute, HbA1c greater than 7%, and AST higher than 40 U/L were risk factors of ICU admission for COVID-19 patients with diabetes. Investigating and monitoring these factors could assist in the risk stratification of COVID-19 patients with DM at an early stage.","Lei, Ming; Lin, Kashuai; Pi, Yaoqiu; Huang, Xiaomei; Fan, Lixin; Huang, Jun; Liu, Riguang; Liu, Lin; Shao, Xinning; Hu, Kaiyuan; Yang, Liuping; Qin, Shuguang; He, Feng",J Diabetes Res,99,16

Boosting innate immunity with Bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG) or other live attenuated vaccines may also play a role in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. BCG has long been known for its non-specific beneficial effects, most likely explained by epigenetic and metabolic reprogramming of innate immune cells, termed trained immunity. In this issue of the JCI, Rivas et al. add to these arguments by showing that BCG-vaccinated healthcare providers from a Los Angeles healthcare organization had less COVID-19 diagnosis and serology, compared to unvaccinated individuals. Prospective clinical trials are thus warranted to explore BCG effects in COVID-19. We posit that beyond COVID-19, vaccines that elicit trained immunity, such as the BCG, may mitigate the impact of emerging pathogens in future pandemics.","Netea, Mihai G; van der Meer, Jos Wm; van Crevel, Reinout",,99,20

The data is collected for the time period of 1stMarch,2020 to 30thApril,2020 (61 Days). The total number of cases as on 30thApril is found to be 35043 confirmed cases with 1147 total deaths and 8889 recovered patients. The model has been developed in Python 3.6.3 to obtain the predicted values of aforementioned cases till 30thJune,2020. The proposed methodology is based on prediction of values using support vector regression model with Radial Basis Function as the kernel and 10% confidence interval for the curve fitting. The data has been split into train and test set with test size 40% and training 60%. The model performance parameters are calculated as mean square error, root mean square error, regression score and percentage accuracy. The model has above 97% accuracy in predicting deaths, recovered, cumulative number of confirmed cases and 87% accuracy in predicting daily new cases. The results suggest a Gaussian decrease of the number of cases and could take another 3 to 4 months to come down the minimum level with no new cases being reported. The method is very efficient and has higher accuracy than linear or polynomial regression.","Parbat, Debanjan; Chakraborty, Monisha",Chaos Solitons Fractals,99,28

Particularly, viral replication and assembly often take place in viral factories where specific viral and cellular proteins as well as nucleic acids concentrate. Viral factories can be either membrane-delimited or devoid of any cellular membranes. In the latter case, they are referred as membrane-less replication compartments. The most emblematic ones are the Negri bodies, which are inclusion bodies that constitute the hallmark of rabies virus infection. Interestingly, Negri bodies and several other viral replication compartments have been shown to arise from a liquid-liquid phase separation process and, thus, constitute a new class of liquid organelles. This is a paradigm shift in the field of virus replication. Here, we review the different aspects of membrane-less virus replication compartments with a focus on the Mononegavirales order and discuss their interactions with the host cell machineries and the cytoskeleton. We particularly examine the interplay between viral factories and the cellular innate immune response, of which several components also form membrane-less condensates in infected cells.","Nevers, Quentin; Albertini, Aurélie A; Lagaudrière-Gesbert, Cécile; Gaudin, Yves",Biochim Biophys Acta Mol Cell Res,99,21

As yet, there are very few drugs to treat this infection and no vaccine is currently available. It has gradually become apparant that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is not a simple disease involving a single organ; rather, many vital organs and systems are affected. The endothelium is one target of SARS-CoV-2. Damaged endothelial cells, which break away from organs and enter the bloodstream to form circulating endothelial cells, were recently reported as putative biomarkers for COVID-19. Modulation of the expression level of sphingosine-1 phosphate via sphingosine kinase activation can control endothelial cell proliferation and apoptosis. As such, it may be possible to obtain a sensitive and specific diagnosis of the severity of COVID-19 by assessing the absolute number and the viable/apoptotic ratio of circulating endothelial cells. Furthermore, a focus on the endothelium could help to develop a strategy for COVID-19 treatment from the perspective of endothelial protection and repair.","Zhang, Xuchang; Jiang, Man; Yang, Jianshe",Int J Infect Dis,99,26

All species exhibited sperm that is not usually observed in insects in general. The most highlighted features are the displacement of the nucleus running parallel to the flagellar components, hitherto observed only in coccinellid and carabid beetles, and the presence of thin and dense structures along the nucleus, probably derived from the centriole adjunct, a feature that is so far exclusive to these insects. The other structures are a typical axoneme for insects with 9 + 9 + 2 microtubules, in a position diametrically opposite relative to the nucleus, two slender, symmetrical mitochondrial derivatives and a pair of discrete accessory bodies. This arrangement provides a bilaterally symmetrical flagellum, which favourably influences sperm hydrodynamics, as will be discussed. The occurrence of this unusual structural arrangement in the sperm of species from superfamilies that are phylogenetically as distant as Elateroidea and Buprestoidea support the monophyly of the infraorder Elateriformia, as proposed by some previous molecular studies.","Dias, Glenda; Lino-Neto, José; Dallai, Romano; Mercati, David; Lupetti, Pietro",Arthropod Struct Dev,99,26
239510,239510,239510,Withdrawal of inhaled corticosteroids in COPD,15.105209,8.531958,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 outbreak has left many people isolated within their homes; these people are turning to social media for news and social connection, which leaves them vulnerable to believing and sharing misinformation. Health-related misinformation threatens adherence to public health messaging, and monitoring its spread on social media is critical to understanding the evolution of ideas that have potentially negative public health impacts. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to use Twitter data to explore methods to characterize and classify four COVID-19 conspiracy theories and to provide context for each of these conspiracy theories through the first 5 months of the pandemic. METHODS: We began with a corpus of COVID-19 tweets (approximately 120 million) spanning late January to early May 2020. We first filtered tweets using regular expressions (n=1.8 million) and used random forest classification models to identify tweets related to four conspiracy theories. Our classified data sets were then used in downstream sentiment analysis and dynamic topic modeling to characterize the linguistic features of COVID-19 conspiracy theories as they evolve over time. RESULTS: Analysis using model-labeled data was beneficial for increasing the proportion of data matching misinformation indicators. Random forest classifier metrics varied across the four conspiracy theories considered (F1 scores between 0.347 and 0.857); this performance increased as the given conspiracy theory was more narrowly defined. We showed that misinformation tweets demonstrate more negative sentiment when compared to nonmisinformation tweets and that theories evolve over time, incorporating details from unrelated conspiracy theories as well as real-world events. CONCLUSIONS: Although we focus here on health-related misinformation, this combination of approaches is not specific to public health and is valuable for characterizing misinformation in general, which is an important first step in creating targeted messaging to counteract its spread. Initial messaging should aim to preempt generalized misinformation before it becomes widespread, while later messaging will need to target evolving conspiracy theories and the new facets of each as they become incorporated.","Gerts, Dax; Shelley, Courtney D; Parikh, Nidhi; Pitts, Travis; Watson Ross, Chrysm; Fairchild, Geoffrey; Vaquera Chavez, Nidia Yadria; Daughton, Ashlynn R",JMIR Public Health Surveill,99,16

The Dashboard reports live counts of the number and type of patients in each of the six adult metropolitan public EDs in Adelaide, South Australia.ResultsThere was a significant difference in the mean daily average occupied ED capacity before and during two distinct increases in COVID-19 cases in South Australia. An increase in COVID-19 cases coincided with a decrease in patients in EDs (Pearson's r=-0.93 and -0.67; P<0.001 for both). Presentations in Australasian Triage Scale (ATS) Categories 2-5 decreased during these periods, whereas ATS Category 1 stayed constant. Mental health patients continued to present to the ED, despite the overall drop in ED presentations.ConclusionsDuring the two periods of COVID-19 case growth in South Australia, there was a significant drop in the number of patients presenting to the major public EDs and a change in the casemix of patients over time.What is known about the topic?EDs in Australia often operate at or over capacity, with frequent reports of ambulance ramping, access block and long waiting times. There have been reports internationally of significant declines in ED presentations throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.What does this paper add?This paper uses a novel publicly available data source that is available in real time to contribute a new perspective from South Australia, which has experienced two distinct periods of strict restrictions and lockdown. The research showed that the number of mental health presentations remained consistently high, despite a significant overall decline in ED occupancy.What are the implications for practitioners?This study demonstrates that South Australians are accessing emergency medical treatment differently in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the context of an overall decline in presentation numbers, the number of mental health-related presentations has not changed significantly, suggesting that this trend should be closely monitored. The findings corroborate the national concern that unwell people have avoided accessing emergency medical care during the pandemic, leading to worse outcomes and increased need for healthcare resources at a later date. It will be important to monitor and quickly detect further changes in ED usage using real-time data as the pandemic evolves, as well as in any future significant health crises.","Boyle, Laura M; Mackay, Mark; Bean, Nigel; Roughan, Matthew",,99,16

Majority of information and evidence gathered so far regarding COVID-19 has been derived from data and studies in adult populations. Crucial information regarding the characterization, clinical symptomatology, sequelae, and overall outcomes in the pediatric population is lacking. As such, we aimed to conduct a comprehensive meta-analysis and systematic review to collect and analyze current evidence about COVID-19 in the pediatric population. METHOD: A systematic search and review of scientific literatures was conducted following the PRISMA guidelines using PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Medline, and Google Scholar databases. All relevant studies until June 16, 2020 were included. Studies were reviewed for methodological quality, and random-effects model was used to conduct the primary meta-analysis. I2 value and Egger's test was used to estimate heterogeneity and publication bias respectively. RESULTS: We reviewed 20 eligible studies that included 1810 pediatric patient population (<21 yo) with PCR tested COVID-19 positivity. In pooled data, majority (25 % [CI 18-32], I2 59 %) of overall COVID-19 positive patients fell in the 6-10 yr age group. 13 % ([CI 11-14], I2 78 %) of the patients were asymptomatic, with headache (67 % [CI 60-74], I2 46 %), fever (55 % [CI 52-58], I2 61 %), and cough (45 % [CI 42-49], I2 79 %) accounting for the most prevalent physical signs seen in symptomatic patients. Leukopenia (12 % [CI 9-15], I250 %) and lymphopenia (15 % [CI 13-19], I2 85 %) was common. Elevated Ferritin (26 % [CI 16-40], I2 73 %), Procal (25 % [CI 21-29 %], I2 83 %), and CRP (19 % [CI 16-22 %], I2 74 %) were other laboratory abnormalities commonly observed. Common radiological features were ground-glass opacities (36 % [CI 32-39 %], I2 92 %), normal finding (33 % [CI 30-36 %], I2 81 %), and consolidation. 29 % ([CI 26-33], I2 85 %) of the patient cases was non-severe, whereas only 5 % ([CI 1-8], I2 87 %) was severe. Mortality was observed in 0.3 % ([CI 0.1-0.4], I2 0%) of the overall cases. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 is prevalent across all pediatric age-groups and presents with varying degree of symptomology. However, children have a milder course of the disease with extremely favorable prognosis. Laboratory and radiological features are inconsistent and require further investigations. Additional studies are needed on this topic to corroborate findings and establish evidence-based and consistent characterization of COVID-19 in the pediatric population.","Badal, Sujan; Thapa Bajgain, Kalpana; Badal, Sujeena; Thapa, Rama; Bajgain, Bishnu B; Santana, Maria Jose",J Clin Virol,99,1

Along with small size vanadium complexes a vanadium-containing derivative of the peptide-like inhibitor N3 (N-[(5-methylisoxazol-3-yl)carbonyl]alanyl-l-valyl-N1-((1R,2Z)-4-(benzyloxy)-4-oxo-1-{[(3R)-2-oxopyrrolidin-3-yl] methyl }but-2-enyl)-l-leucinamide) was designed from the crystal structure with PDB entry code 6LU7. On theoretical grounds our consensus docking studies evaluated the binding affinities at the hitherto known binding site of Mpro for binding vanadium complexes. The site is an evolutionarily fold unit which is structurally conserved among proteins belonging to the same enzyme class (EC 3). The highly conserved sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 protease Mpro has a Cys-His dyad at the catalytic site that are characteristic of metal-dependent or metal-inhibited hydrolases. Therefore, Mpro was superimposed to the human protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B (hPTP1B) which is a key regulator at an early stage in the signalling cascade of the insulin hormone for glucose uptake into cells. Comparatively, the vanadium-ligand binding site of hPTP1B is located in a larger groove on the surface of Mpro. Vanadium constitutes a well-known phosphate analogue. Hence, its study offers possibilities to design promising vanadium-containing binders to SARS-CoV-2. Given the favourable physicochemical properties of vanadium nuclei, such organic vanadium complexes could become drugs not only for pharmacotherapy but also diagnostic tools for early infection detection in patients. This work presents the in silico design of a potential lead vanadium compound. It was tested along with 20 other vanadium-containing complexes from the literature in a virtual screening test by docking against the inhibition of Mpro of SARS-CoV-2.","Scior, Thomas; Abdallah, Hassan H; Fatimah Zaharah Mustafa, Siti; Antonio Guevara-García, José; Rehder, Dieter",Inorganica Chim Acta,99,16

The presence of specific estrogen receptors is required for estrogen to have its characteristic ubiquitous action in almost all tissues. Estrogen receptor alpha (ER&#945;) and estrogen receptor beta (ERß) are the major isoforms of estrogen that are highly specific in humans and enable selective hormonal actions in different tissues. This article reviews some of the observed estrogen actions and effects in different tissues and cells through these specific receptors.

The primary causes of CFD include the presence of folate receptor (FR) autoantibodies, defects of FR encoding gene FOLR1, mitochondrial diseases and congenital abnormalities in folate metabolism. CASE PRESENTATION: Here we first present a Chinese male CFD patient whose seizure onset at 2 years old with convulsive status epilepticus. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) revealed the development of encephalomalacia, laminar necrosis in multiple lobes of the brain and cerebellar atrophy. Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) uncovered a homozygous missense variant of c.524G > T (p.C175F) in FOLR1 gene. Further laboratory tests demonstrated the extremely low level of 5-MTHF in the CSF from this patient, which was attributed to cerebral folate transport deficiency. Following the intravenous and oral treatment of calcium folinate, the concentrations of 5-MTHF in CSF were recovered to the normal range and seizure symptoms were relieved as well. CONCLUSIONS: One novel variation of FOLR1 was firstly identified from a Chinese male patient with tonic-clonic seizures, developmental delay, and ataxia. The WES and laboratory results elucidated the etiology of the symptoms. Clinical outcomes were improved by early diagnosis and proper treatment.","Zhang, Ciliu; Deng, Xiaolu; Wen, Yafei; He, Fang; Yin, Fei; Peng, Jing",BMC Med Genet,99,24

(Special Issue: Coronavirus (COVID-19) collection.),15.561776,8.351331,2020,"Background The 2020 COVID-19 pandemic led to a strict lockdown in France from March 17 to May 11, 2020. After the lockdown, the French strategy to mitigate the impact of SARS-CoV-2 relied partly on investigations of all confirmed cases. Monitoring collective settings is particularly important since SARS-CoV-2 seems prone to superspreading events (SSEs). Methods Our study is based on data gathered in Paris from May 11 to December 31, 2020, by the Ile-de-France Regional Health Agency (RHA) to investigate cases occurring in collective and high-risk settings. Specific events in high-risk settings were systematically transmitted to the RHA, and screenings were organized by the facilities, while other settings were reported when three cases were identified within a short period. These settings were more difficult to identify through the surveillance system since no systematic screening was organized by the facility, leaving screenings to rely on the national contact-tracing programme. No official superspreading threshold has been set for SARS-CoV-2. We defined a SSE as an event involving ten cases. Results We analysed 15,706 events associated with 38,670 cases, representing an average of 2.70 cases per event. Most clusters occurred in educational facilities, workplace environments, social care settings, and healthcare facilities. SSEs represented 3.4% but accounted for 28% of all cases reported. The highest number of SSEs occurred in college settings (12.6%), followed by hospitals and retirement homes. Educational facilities had the lowest number of SSEs, with around 1% in preschools and elementary schools. Conclusions We observed different SSE rates in each setting. Preschools and primary schools represented the majority of events but experiencing very few SSEs. Colleges were prone to SSEs and were associated with a high number of secondary cases. These findings provide some insights on contact tracing activities and SARS-CoV-2 transmission in different settings.","Deslandes, Antoine Ardoin Alexis Calba Clémentine Mathey Damian Mahdjoub Sarah Zhu-Soubise Aurélien",Journal of infection and public health,99,16

METHOD: An integrative text mining analysis in Medline was performed to identify studies on the mental health of older adults during the pandemic. Subsequently, statistical topic modeling was performed to identify the most prevalent terms and topics discussed in included studies. RESULTS: A total of 29 studies were retrieved until July 1st 2020, including a majority of letters (12 studies) and commentaries (8 studies). The most frequent terms overall were: loneliness (n = 137), support (n = 132), home (n = 102), suicide (n = 96) and help (n = 94). The most prevalent terms were then divided in five topics: home (33%), suicide (32%), apps (15%), loneliness (12%) and physical activity (9%). Additionally, a section focused on low- and middle-income countries was included. A summary of strategies to mitigate the effects of pandemic in mental health of older adults was also provided.

METHODS: The search was performed in the PROSPERO database using the strategy proposed by the database and considered only human studies. The last date of the search was April 27, 2020. Full text of all records was accessed, and data were extracted by a single researcher, which was further double-checked by another researcher. A descriptive analysis was performed considering record characteristics using tables. RESULTS: We included 564 records from which the vast majority were registered as SRs (n = 513, 91%). In general, we found poor reporting and missing or confusing information, since 84% of the records (n = 474) did not report the full search that would be adopted, 16% (n = 90) did not report clearly the databases that would be used, and 49.1% (n = 277) did not report the number of primary outcomes.

METHODS: This is a multicenter retrospective study in Fars Province, Iran, from August 22 to October 4, 2020. People with a past history of chemical war injury and COVID-19 were studied. Two age- and sex-matched control groups, double the size of the patient group each, from the same database of patients with COVID-19 who were hospitalized at the same time (ie, healthy controls and pseudocontrols). RESULTS: A total of 46 people with a past history of chemical war injury, 92 healthy controls, and 92 pseudocontrols were studied. People with COVID-19 and a past history of chemical war injury had a significantly higher rate of chest pain compared with others. There were no other clinical differences between the groups. Mortality rate was 17.39%, 15.21%, and 27.17% in people with a past history of chemical war injury, the control group, and the pseudocontrol group, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: A past history of a chemical war injury does not add to the risk of COVID-19 and does not significantly modify its clinical picture either.","Emami, Amir; Pezeshkian, FatemehSadat; Javanmardi, Fatemeh; Akbari, Ali; Asadi-Pooya, Ali A",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,99,16

Hospital Kuala Lumpur, where thoracic procedures are performed, was badly affected. We describe our experience in performing aerosol generating procedures safely in thoracic surgery during the Covid-19 era. METHODS: Medical records of patients who underwent thoracic surgery from March 18, 2020 to May 17, 2020 were reviewed retrospectively. All patients undergoing thoracic surgery were tested for Covid-19 using the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction method. Patients with malignancy were observed for 10 to 14 days in the ward after testing negative. The healthcare workers donned personal protective equipment for all the cases, and the number of healthcare workers in the operating room was limited to the minimum required. RESULTS: A total of 44 procedures were performed in 26 thoracic surgeries. All of these procedures were classified as aerosol generating, and the mean duration of the surgery was 130 ± 43 minutes. None of the healthcare workers involved in the surgery were exposed or infected by Covid-19. CONCLUSION: Covid-19 will be a threat for a long time and thoracic surgeons must continue to provide their services, despite having to deal with aerosol generating procedures, in the new normal. Covid-19 testing of all surgical candidates, using the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, donning full personal protective equipment for healthcare workers, and carefully planned procedures are among the measures suggested to prevent unnecessary Covid-19 exposure in thoracic surgery.","Sathiamurthy, Narasimman; Balasubbiah, Narendran; Dharmaraj, Benedict",Asian Cardiovasc Thorac Ann,99,6

DESIGN: Scoping review supplemented with expert interviews to validate the findings. SETTING: Hospitals. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, bioRxiv and medRxiv systematically and grey literature for articles focusing on the impact of COVID-19-like working conditions on the physical and/or mental health of healthcare professionals in a hospital setting. Articles using an empirical design about determinants or causes of physical and/or mental health and about interventions, measures and policies to preserve physical and/or mental health were included. Four experts were interviewed to reflect on the results from the scoping review. RESULTS: In total, 4471 records were screened leading to an inclusion of 73 articles. Recommendations prior to the outbreak fostering resilience included optimal provision of education and training, resilience training and interventions to create a feeling of being prepared. Recommendations during the outbreak consisted of (1) enhancing resilience by proper provision of information, psychosocial support and treatment (eg, create enabling conditions such as forming a psychosocial support team), monitoring the health status of professionals and using various forms and content of psychosocial support (eg, encouraging peer support, sharing and celebrating successes), (2) tasks and responsibilities, in which attention should be paid to kind of tasks, task mix and responsibilities as well as the intensity and weight of these tasks and (3) work patterns and working conditions. Findings of the review were validated by experts. CONCLUSIONS: Recommendations were developed on how to build and maintain resilience of frontline healthcare professionals exposed to COVID-19 outbreak working conditions. These practical and easy to implement recommendations can be used by hospitals and other healthcare organisations to foster and preserve short-term and long-term physical and mental health and employability of their professionals.","Rieckert, Anja; Schuit, Ewoud; Bleijenberg, Nienke; Ten Cate, Debbie; de Lange, Wendela; de Man-van Ginkel, Janneke M; Mathijssen, Elke; Smit, Linda C; Stalpers, Dewi; Schoonhoven, Lisette; Veldhuizen, Jessica D; Trappenburg, Jaap Ca",BMJ Open,99,0

This involvement could help explaining the pathogenesis of this condition and lead to novel therapeutic approaches. OBJECTIVE: To assess the occurrence of neurological symptoms in COVID-19 patients during the Italian pandemic outbreak, as reported by physicians. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the early days of pandemic emergence we developed an online survey open to all Italian clinicians involved in the diagnosis and management of COVID-19 patients. The survey was structured in three sections, with nine different items concerning the presence of different specific clinical abnormalities. Each item was graded from ""absent"" to ""severe"" in a 4-point Likert's scale. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Likert's scale data were analyzed by studying the distribution of responses by using medians and bar charts-relative frequencies. Also, in order to analyze differences in symptoms findings depending on the group of specialty, Likert's scale data were combined into two nominal categories (""absent""/""low"" and ""moderate""/""high""/"") and a contingency table chi-square test was used. RESULTS: 126 physicians of 9 different medical specialties, from 10 regions of Italy, filled the online survey. The results show that 87.3% of practitioners reported neurological symptoms. In most cases these were mild and non-specific, but they were severe in a minority of patients. The most common symptoms observed were headache, myalgia and taste and smell abnormalities. Whilst there was no difference between neurologists and non-neurologists, we found that experienced clinicians (defined as clinicians that evaluated more than 30 patients) reported neurological symptoms more frequently than non-expert. CONCLUSIONS: Neurological symptoms have frequently been ported during the Italian COVID-19 pandemic, and thus should be monitored for all affected patients. Whilst some of the disturbances reported may be non-specific and common to other infectious diseases, smell and taste abnormalities might indicate nervous system as entry door for SARS-CoV-2 virus. This interpretation should promote research trials to avoid nervous system involvement.","Campiglio, Laura; Priori, Alberto",PLoS One,99,16

Soldiers were offered group lectures, on-site consultations and primary care office visits, discussing concerns on vaccination with a primary care physician. Overall, 359 (70.3%) soldiers participated in the group lectures, 33 (6.5%) in on-site consultations and 19 (3.7%) attended primary care visits. Overall, 459 (89.8%) of 511 soldiers vaccinated for COVID-19. Of the 90 soldiers initially refusing, 38 (42.2%) had agreed to receive a vaccine.

Their ability to be agile and adaptive has been stressed, particularly in regard to the timing of policy measures, the level of decision centralization, the autonomy of decisions and the balance between change and stability. In this contribution we use our observations of responses to COVID-19 to reflect on agility and adaptive governance and provide tools to evaluate it after the dust has settled. Whereas agility relates mainly to the speed of response within given structures, adaptivity implies system-level changes throughout government. Existing institutional structures and tools can enable adaptivity and agility, which can be complimentary approaches. However, agility sometimes conflicts with adaptability. Our analysis points to the paradoxical nature of adaptive governance. Indeed, successful adaptive governance calls for both decision speed and sound analysis, for both centralized and decentralized decision-making, for both innovation and bureaucracy, and both science and politics.","Janssen, Marijn; van der Voort, Haiko",Int J Inf Manage,99,26

Although survival-related traits often trade off with reproduction, survival-related traits themselves may trade off with each other under energy limitation. Whole-organism performance and the immune system both enhance survival, yet are costly, but it is unclear how the two might trade off with each other under energy-limited conditions. Resources may be allocated to very different types of performance (e.g., aerobic endurance versus anaerobic sprinting) just as they may be allocated to different components of the immune system (e.g., innate versus acquired) to maximize survival. We forced allocation to different performance traits in green anole lizards (Anolis carolinensis), using specialized exercise training, to determine how different components of the immune system would be impacted by shifts in energy use. We measured immunocompetence in endurance trained, sprint trained, and untrained control lizards with the swelling response to phytohemagglutinin (cell-mediated), antibody response to sheep red blood cells (acquired humoral), and wound healing (integrated). Endurance-trained lizards had reduced cell-mediated immunity, whereas sprint-trained lizards had reduced rates of wound healing. The acquired immune response was not affected by either type of training. Because each immune measure responded differently to the different types of training, our results do not support the hypothesis that simple energy limitation determines overall investment in immunity. Instead, different components of the immune system appear to be affected in ways specific to how energy is invested in performance.","Wang, Andrew Z; Husak, Jerry F",J. exp. biol,99,16

To this end, we construct a small open economy dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model enclosing a tourism sector and a housing market with owner-occupied and rental sections. The simulation results unveil a transmission channel that indicates the higher inbound tourism demand raises both house prices and rental prices. Variance decomposition and historical decomposition show that both inbound tourism demand shock and manufacturing technology shock are the key driving forces of the fluctuations of Icelandic house prices, consumption, and investment, whereas housing preference shock plays the most important role in determining the volatility of rental prices. The policy implications indicate that any shocks to tourism could easily spillover to housing market dynamics and aggregate fluctuations.

Some severe and critical cases have bad prognoses and high case fatality rates, unraveling risk factors for severe COVID-19 are of significance for predicting and preventing illness progression, and reducing case fatality rates. Our study focused on analyzing characteristics of COVID-19 cases and exploring risk factors for developing severe COVID-19. METHODS: The data for this study was disease surveillance data on symptomatic cases of COVID-19 reported from 30 provinces in China between January 19 and March 9, 2020, which included demographics, dates of symptom onset, clinical manifestations at the time of diagnosis, laboratory findings, radiographic findings, underlying disease history, and exposure history. We grouped mild and moderate cases together as non-severe cases and categorized severe and critical cases together as severe cases. We compared characteristics of severe cases and non-severe cases of COVID-19 and explored risk factors for severity. RESULTS: The total number of cases were 12 647 with age from less than 1 year old to 99 years old. The severe cases were 1662 (13.1%), the median age of severe cases was 57 years [Inter-quartile range(IQR): 46-68] and the median age of non-severe cases was 43 years (IQR: 32-54). The risk factors for severe COVID-19 were being male [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.3, 95% CI: 1.2-1.5]; fever (aOR = 2.3, 95% CI: 2.0-2.7), cough (aOR = 1.4, 95% CI: 1.2-1.6), fatigue (aOR = 1.3, 95% CI: 1.2-1.5), and chronic kidney disease (aOR = 2.5, 95% CI: 1.4-4.6), hypertension (aOR = 1.5, 95% CI: 1.2-1.8) and diabetes (aOR = 1.96, 95% CI: 1.6-2.4). With the increase of age, risk for the severity was gradually higher [20-39 years (aOR = 3.9, 95% CI: 1.8-8.4), 40-59 years (aOR = 7.6, 95% CI: 3.6-16.3), &#8805; 60 years (aOR = 20.4, 95% CI: 9.5-43.7)], and longer time from symtem onset to diagnosis [3-5 days (aOR = 1.4, 95% CI: 1.2-1.7), 6-8 days (aOR = 1.8, 95% CI: 1.5-2.1), &#8805; 9 days(aOR = 1.9, 95% CI: 1.6-2.3)]. CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed the risk factors for developing severe COVID-19 with large sample size, which included being male, older age, fever, cough, fatigue, delayed diagnosis, hypertension, diabetes, chronic kidney diasease, early case identification and prompt medical care. Based on these factors, the severity of COVID-19 cases can be predicted. So cases with these risk factors should be paid more attention to prevent severity.","Geng, Meng-Jie; Wang, Li-Ping; Ren, Xiang; Yu, Jian-Xing; Chang, Zhao-Rui; Zheng, Can-Jun; An, Zhi-Jie; Li, Yu; Yang, Xiao-Kun; Zhao, Hong-Ting; Li, Zhong-Jie; He, Guang-Xue; Feng, Zi-Jian",Infect Dis Poverty,99,21

This novel coronavirus, responsible by the COVID-19 outbreak since the end of 2019, became a challenge since there is not vaccine for this disease. The first step in this investigation was to solvate the isolated S-protein in water for molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, being observed a transition from ""up"" to ""down"" conformation of receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S-protein with angle of 54.3 and 43.0 degrees, respectively. The RBD region was more exposed to the solvent and to the possible drugs due to its enhanced surface area. From the equilibrated MD structure, virtual screening by docking calculations were performed using a library contained 9091 FDA approved drugs. Among them, 24 best-scored ligands (14 traditional herbal isolate and 10 approved drugs) with the binding energy below -8.1 kcal/mol were selected as potential candidates to inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein, preventing the human cell infection and their replication. For instance, the ivermectin drug (present in our list of promise candidates) was recently used successful to control viral replication in vitro. MD simulations were performed for the three best ligands@S-protein complexes and the binding energies were calculated using the MM/PBSA approach. Overall, it is highlighted an important strategy, some key residues, and chemical groups which may be considered on clinical trials for COVID-19 outbreak.","de Oliveira, Osmair Vital; Rocha, Gerd B; Paluch, Andrew S; Costa, Luciano T",J Biomol Struct Dyn,99,24

Nano-scale HA particles are increasingly being used as carriers for controlled and targeted delivery of bioactive agents like drugs, proteins, and nucleic acids due to their high porosity, negative charge, and biodegradability. Purpose: Although much effort has been devoted to understanding the delivery kinetics and effects of the payloads in such carriers, a thorough understanding of the influence of the carriers themselves is lacking. Methods: HA particles (300 µg/mL) were administered to primary human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs). The uptake and intracellular localization of the particles were determined by flow cytometry, confocal imaging, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Immunological assays and PCR were performed to determine the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and collagens in cell lysates and media supernatant. Results: The current study explores the effects of poly-dispersed HA particles on primary HDFs as a model system. The majority of the particles were determined to range between 150 and 200 nm in diameter. Upon exposure to HA suspensions, primary HDFs internalized the particles by endocytosis within 6 hours of exposure, showing maximum uptake at 72 hours following which the particles were exocytosed by 168 hours. This correlated to reduced secretion of various pro-inflammatory and pro-collagenic cytokines. Biochemical analysis further revealed a reduction in Type I collagen expression and secretion. Conclusion: HA particles have an immune-modulatory effect on dermal fibroblasts and reduce collagen production, which may impact the integrity of the extracellular matrix (ECM). This study demonstrates the need to consider the secondary effects of particulate carriers like HA, beyond basic cytotoxicity, in the specific tissue environment where the intended function is to be realized.","Rakshit, Moumita; Gautam, Archana; Toh, Li Zhen; Lee, Ying Shi; Lai, Hui Ying; Wong, Tina T; Ng, Kee Woei",Int J Nanomedicine,99,20

Treatment was started with oral favipiravir and ciclesonide inhalation. On the 10th day of treatment, the patient had a persistent high fever and a chest CT showed exacerbation of pneumonia, so dexamethasone was intravenously started. He was discharged after confirming two consecutive negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests. Three months after COVID-19 treatment, a SARS-CoV-2 PCR test was negative and he underwent a deceased donor kidney transplantation. Basiliximab induction with triple drug immunosuppression consisting of extended-release tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil and prednisolone, which is our regular immunosuppression protocol, was used. He was discharged on postoperative day 18 without the need for postoperative hemodialysis or any complications. The serum creatinine level was 1.72 mg/dL 95 days postoperatively and he had a favorable clinical course that was similar to deceased donor kidney recipients without a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Despite the rapid progression of the disease, there is limited information of the factors associated with mortality in Florida. This study aims to review the demographics, characteristics, comorbidities, complications, and outcomes of hospitalized patients, and their association with mortality. Design: Cohort study. Setting: A community-based tertiary-care hospital of Orlando Health, Orlando Regional Medical Center. Patients/Subjects: Data of hospitalized patients who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 between March 1, 2020, and August 31, 2020, at the Orlando Regional Medical Center. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: Main data assessed included patient demographics, clinical characteristics, comorbidities, complications, outcomes, and inhospital mortality. The median age for hospitalized patients was 61 years;among them, 56% were males. Most were of African American (n = 288, 35.9%), Hispanic (n = 237, 29.6%), and Caucasian (n = 217, 27.1%) descent. More patients presented with symptoms developing at home (n = 589, 75.9%) than from skilled nursing and long-term acute care facilities. The most common comorbidities were diabetes mellitus (42.8%), obesity (39.2%), lung disease (23.3%), coronary artery disease (20.2%), and congestive heart failure (18.3%). Complications with higher odds of mortality were mechanical ventilation (odds ratio, 148.00, p &lt; 0.001), coinfections (odds ratio, 56.42, p &lt; 0.001), acute kidney injury (odds ratio, 84.01, p &lt; 0.001), atrial fibrillation (odds ratio, 28.30, p &lt; 0.001), acute myocardial infarction (odds ratio, 23.29, p &lt; 0.001), and acute venous thromboembolism (odds ratio, 26.43, p &lt; 0.001). Conclusions: We identified an increase of severity of coronavirus disease 2019 within older patients of African American and Hispanic descent with comorbidities such as diabetes, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, chronic kidney disease, cancer, liver disease, or cerebrovascular disease. Noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation and high-flow nasal cannula oxygen may have helped avert mechanical ventilation, and this may have improved patient outcomes over the course of the study period.","Patel, S.

Methods : Participants were sampled in February 2019 (N = 1,020), April 2020 (N = 1,041), May 2020 (N = 1,032), and December 2020 (N = 1,100) using the same self-report measures. Results : The prevalence of PTSD significantly increased from 12.5% in 2019 to 18.0% in April 2020, to 22.0% in May, and returning to 17.6% in December 2020. PTSD increases were most consistently observed in males, those aged 18-34 years, those without a university qualification, and those living in the Leinster region of Ireland, where the capital city of Dublin is located. There were no significant changes in the prevalence of depression or GAD. Limitations : The 2020 samples were not completely independent of one another and while the analysis took this into account, this bias cannot be completely removed. Conclusions : These findings show an increase in PTSD during the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the pre-pandemic period and suggest specificity in mental health responses to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Daly, Michael MacLachlan Malcolm Maguire Rebecca Power Joanna McHugh Nolan Ann Shevlin Mark Spikol Eric Vallières Frédérique Hyland Philip",Journal of Affective Disorders Reports,99,16

Here, we show that the actin-related protein (Arp) 2/3 complex, a key factor in actin filament branching and polymerization, is involved in the shuttling of aquaporin-2 (AQP2) between the trans Golgi network (TGN) and the plasma membrane. Arp2/3 inhibition (using CK-666) or siRNA knockdown blocks vasopressin induced AQP2 membrane accumulation, and induces the formation of distinct AQP2 perinuclear patches positive for markers of TGN-derived clathrin coated vesicles. After a 20oC cold block, AQP2 formed perinuclear patches due continuous endocytosis coupled with inhibition of exit from the TGN-associated vesicles. Upon rewarming, AQP2 normally leaves the TGN, and redistributes into the cytoplasm, entering the exocytotic pathway. Inhibition of Arp2/3 blocked this process, and trapped AQP2 in clathrin positive vesicles. Taken together, these results suggest that Arp2/3 is essential for AQP2 trafficking, specifically for its delivery into the post-TGN exocytotic pathway to the plasma membrane.","Liu, Chen-Chung Steven; Cheung, Pui W; Dinesh, Anupama; Baylor, Noah; Paunescu, Theodor C; Nair, Anil V; Bouley, Richard; Brown, Dennis","Am. j. physiol., Renal fluid electrolyte physiol",99,16

Here, we use deep neural networks over an institution-wide platform for the augmented curation of clinical notes from 77,167 patients subjected to COVID-19 PCR testing. By contrasting Electronic Health Record (EHR)-derived symptoms of COVID-19-positive (COVIDpos; n = 2,317) versus COVID-19-negative (COVIDneg; n = 74,850) patients for the week preceding the PCR testing date, we identify anosmia/dysgeusia (27.1-fold), fever/chills (2.6-fold), respiratory difficulty (2.2-fold), cough (2.2-fold), myalgia/arthralgia (2-fold), and diarrhea (1.4-fold) as significantly amplified in COVIDpos over COVIDneg patients. The combination of cough and fever/chills has 4.2-fold amplification in COVIDpos patients during the week prior to PCR testing, in addition to anosmia/dysgeusia, constitutes the earliest EHR-derived signature of COVID-19.

OBJECTIVE In this article we present a first attempt to understand the immediate impact of COVID-19 and the sanitary measures taken by governments on farming systems in Central America and Mexico (CAM). METHODS Through a review of information generated in these initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic (webinars, blogs, electronic publications, media) and 44 interviews with key informants across the region, we have identified the main impacts felt by different types of farming systems in the region. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS From corporate agricultural production systems, to small and medium scale entrepreneurs and smallholder subsistence farm households, all types of farming systems were impacted, more or less severely, by the different measures implemented by governments such as reduced mobility, closure of public and private venues and restrictions in borders. Larger corporate farming systems with vertical market integration and high level of control or coordination within the supply chain, and smallholder or subsistence farming systems with important focus on production for self-consumption and little external input use, were both relatively less impacted and showed greater adaptive capacity than the medium and small entrepreneurial farming systems dependent on agriculture as their primary income and with less control over the upstream and downstream parts of their supply chain. All types of farming systems implemented a series of mechanisms to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic including the development of alternative value chains, food and agricultural products delivery systems and the exponential use of digital means to communicate and maintain the viability of the different agricultural systems. Collective action and organization of farmers also proved to be an important coping mechanism that allowed some farmers to acquire inputs and deliver outputs in the context of restricted mobility, price volatility, and general uncertainty. Some features of the CAM region played an important role in mediating the impact of COVID-19 and associated sanitary measures. We identify as particularly relevant the nature of agricultural exports, the current structure of the agricultural sector, the diversified livelihood strategies of rural households, and the importance of mobility for rural livelihoods. SIGNIFICANCE The results presented focus only in the immediate effect of COVID-19 pandemic and the mechanisms implemented by farmers in the first months. Whether these impacts and response mechanisms will result in a transformation of the farming systems towards greater resilience and sustainability is still an open question.","Lopez-Ridaura, Santiago Sanders Arie Barba-Escoto Luis Wiegel Jennifer Mayorga-Cortes Maria Gonzalez-Esquivel Carlos Lopez-Ramirez Martin A.; Escoto-Masis, Rene M.; Morales-Galindo, Edmundo García-Barcena Tomas S.",Agricultural Systems,99,26

It is unclear how shelter-in-place orders affected acute CVD hospitalizations, illness severity, and outcomes. HYPOTHESIS: COVID-19 pandemic was associated with reduced acute CVD hospitalizations (heart failure [HF], acute coronary syndrome [ACS], and stroke [CVA]), and worse HF illness severity. METHODS: We compared acute CVD hospitalizations at Duke University Health System before and after North Carolina's shelter-in-place order (January 1-March 29 vs. March 30-August 31), and used parallel comparison cohorts from 2019. We explored illness severity among admitted HF patients using ADHERE (""high risk"": >2 points) and GWTG-HF ("">10%"": >57 points) in-hospital mortality risk scores, as well as echocardiography-derived parameters. RESULTS: Comparing hospitalizations during January 1-March 29 (N = 1618) vs. March 30-August 31 (N = 2501) in 2020, mean daily CVD hospitalizations decreased (18.2 vs. 16.1 per day, p = .0036), with decreased length of stay (8.4 vs. 7.5 days, p = .0081) and no change in in-hospital mortality (4.7 vs. 5.3%, p = .41). HF hospitalizations decreased (9.0 vs. 7.7 per day, p = .0019), with higher ADHERE (""high risk"": 2.5 vs. 4.5%; p = .030), but unchanged GWTG-HF ("">10%"": 5.3 vs. 4.6%; p = .45), risk groups. Mean LVEF was lower (39.0 vs. 37.2%, p = .034), with higher mean LV mass (262.4 vs. 276.6 g, p = .014). CONCLUSIONS: CVD hospitalizations, HF illness severity, and echocardiography measures did not change between admission periods in 2019. Evaluating short-term data, the COVID-19 shelter-in-place order was associated with reductions in acute CVD hospitalizations, particularly HF, with no significant increase in in-hospital mortality and only minor differences in HF illness severity.","Rao, Vishal N; Kelsey, Michelle D; Kelsey, Anita M; Russell, Stuart D; Mentz, Robert J; Patel, Manesh R; Fudim, Marat",Clin Cardiol,99,16

The best algorithm, based on random forest classification combined with the LASSO feature selection algorithm, was employed to the training set to link mutation signatures and outcome. The performance of the final model was estimated by repeated, stratified, 10-fold cross validation (CV) and then adjusted for multiple testing with Bootstrap Bias Corrected CV.

Introduction: During this COVID pandemic, many countries have implemented lockdown measures and people have to work from home and many students and workers have to restrict themselves to home. During this period, their outdoor activities were limited. After the partial release of this lockdown many of them started to have some kind of physical activity and started experiencing body pains. We evaluated such patients for vitamin D3 levels and symptoms of fibromyalgia. Methods: This is a retrospective analysis of patients from age group 18-60 presented to outpatient department or on telephonic consultation after partial release of lockdown. All patients who had mild back ache before lockdown and had symptoms exaggerated during this lockdown release were included. All patients were investigated for vitamin D3, PTH, thyroid profile, liver functional and kidney functional tests. Results: Out of 120 patients presented to us in a period of 3 months, 31 patients had increased symptoms when compared to pre-lockdown status. 20 out of 31 patients had low vitamin D3 levels. 14 patients also developed symptoms of fibromyalgia. Conclusion: There might be many reasons for increased pain during lockdown, but we focussed specially only on vitamin D3 because of its association with increased symptoms of COVID-19. This is a gentle reminder to test for vitamin D3 levels and supplement if found deficient.

The aim of this study was to erect and study a protective barrier for FEES. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A PVC cube was constructed to fit over a patient while allowing for upright endoscopy. A plastic drape was fitted over the cube, and the protective barrier was subsequently named the ""FEES Box."" Three different particulate-generating tasks were carried out: sneezing, coughing, and spraying water from an atomizer bottle. Each task was completed within and without the FEES Box, and particulate was measured with a particle counter. The average particles/L detected during the three tasks, and baseline measurements, were statistically compared. RESULTS: Without the FEES Box in place, the sneezing and spraying tasks resulted in a statistically significant increase in particles above baseline (p < 0.001 and p = 0.004, respectively); coughing particulate never reached levels significantly higher than baseline (p = 0.230). With use of the FEES Box, there was no statistically significant increase in particles above baseline in any of the three tasks. CONCLUSION: The FEES Box effectively contained particles generated during sneezes and an atomizer spray. It would also likely mitigate coughing particulate, but coughing did not generate a significant increase in particles above baseline. Further research is warranted to test the efficacy of the FEES Box in containing particulate matter during a complete FEES procedure.","Ganann, Michelle G; Kitila, Merertu; Patel, Ravi; Brook, Christopher D; Pisegna, Jessica M",Am J Otolaryngol,99,1

The virus SARS-CoV-2 employs the Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a component of the RAAS (Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System) system, as a receptor for entry into the cells. Several classes of synthetic drugs are available for hypertension, rarely associated with severe or mild adverse effects. New natural compounds, such as peptides, might be useful to treat some hypertensive patients. The main feature of ACE inhibitory peptides is the location of the hydrophobic residue, usually Proline, at the C-terminus. Some already known bioactive peptides derived from marine resources have potential ACE inhibitory activity and can be considered therapeutic agents to treat hypertension. Peptides isolated from marine vertebrates, invertebrates, seaweeds, or sea microorganisms displayed important biological activities to treat hypertensive patients. Here, we reviewed the anti-hypertensive activities of bioactive molecules isolated/extracted from marine organisms and discussed the associated molecular mechanisms involved.

Using the established platform as gateways, seven different diol-convertible amino acids are converted to diols including 1,3-propanediol, 1,4-butanediol, and 1,5-pentanediol. Particularly, we afford to optimize the production of 1,4-butanediol and demonstrate the de novo production of 1,5-pentanediol from glucose, with titers reaching 1.41 and 0.97 g l-1, respectively.

This virus was not known before the outbreak in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. By January of 2020 it was declared to be a global human health crisis. The deaths and illnesses caused by the virus caused extensive fear and anxiety among people in all societies. The pandemic slowed economic activities nearly to a halt. The challenges of how companies should respond to the disruptions in their supply chains and how they can build more resilient systems, must be systematically addressed. The authors of this paper highlighted essential factors which can help companies to overcome this crisis and other types of crises, by learning from the approaches taken in India, which has a unique and diverse economic system. The Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) technique was used to identify the essential factors which can help companies to improve their resilience so they can recover during and after the COVID-19 pandemic era and potentially in other similar complex crises. The results of the AHP evaluation were prioritized by performing a sensitivity analysis to prioritize the essential factors. The ""Role of governance"" was found to be the most important factor that can be used to help in rebuilding industries and societies and in helping them to become more resilient to future severe shocks. The results of this research were used to develop recommendations for company managers, practitioners and policy-makers. The authors hope that this advice will help India to become a stronger nation with more resilient companies, which are better prepared to anticipate and to respond to future crises.

The OFTT was implemented on 2 March 2020 and modified regularly based on the revised testing criteria issued by the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health. After testing criteria liberalised, a chatbot tool was set up on 9 April 2020 to assess urgency of testing, referral to available testing sites and need for emergency care.In the first 40 days of the OFTT, there were more than 17 300 visitors and 69.8% indicated they would have contacted the healthcare system if the online test had not been available. During the initial week of operation, using the conservative testing strategy, 9.1% of visitors received recommendations to be tested, which increased to 36.0% of visitors after a change in testing criteria on 9 March 2020. Overall, since the implementation of the tool, 26.27% of all users of the site have been directed to obtain testing. The Chatbot tool has had approximately 50 consults/day.Setting up an OFTT should be considered as part of local strategies to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic.

Based on our analysis of hepatitis C virus and coronavirus replication, and the molecular structures and activities of viral inhibitors, we previously reasoned that the FDA-approved hepatitis C drug EPCLUSA (Sofosbuvir/Velpatasvir) should inhibit coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2. Here, using model polymerase extension experiments, we demonstrate that the active triphosphate form of Sofosbuvir is incorporated by low-fidelity polymerases and SARS-CoV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and blocks further incorporation by these polymerases; the active triphosphate form of Sofosbuvir is not incorporated by a host-like high-fidelity DNA polymerase. Using the same molecular insight, we selected 3'-fluoro-3'-deoxythymidine triphosphate and 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine triphosphate, which are the active forms of two other anti-viral agents, Alovudine and AZT (an FDA-approved HIV/AIDS drug) for evaluation as inhibitors of SARS-CoV RdRp. We demonstrate the ability of two of these HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitors to be incorporated by SARS-CoV RdRp where they also terminate further polymerase extension. Given the 98% amino acid similarity of the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 RdRps, we expect these nucleotide analogues would also inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 polymerase. These results offer guidance to further modify these nucleotide analogues to generate more potent broad-spectrum anti-coronavirus agents.","Ju, Jingyue; Li, Xiaoxu; Kumar, Shiv; Jockusch, Steffen; Chien, Minchen; Tao, Chuanjuan; Morozova, Irina; Kalachikov, Sergey; Kirchdoerfer, Robert N; Russo, James J",Pharmacol Res Perspect,99,21

To complement existing solutions, this paper proposes a different approach. This paper presents a design concept for an application promoting health behavior change based on Bluetooth proximity estimation and nudging theory. The approach is underpinned by current understanding of the main transmission routes, the risk of asymptomatic spreaders, and evidence of physical distancing to reduce transmission risk. The aim of this mobile system is to promote physical distancing, in line with public health guidelines promoted all over the globe.

Data from the emergency department (ED) demonstrate a high rate of longer-acting neuromuscular blocking agent use, delayed analgosedation, and a lack of sedation depth monitoring. These practices are discordant with recommendations for preventing awareness with paralysis. Despite this, awareness with paralysis has not been rigorously studied in the ED population. Our objective is to assess the prevalence of awareness with paralysis in ED patients receiving mechanical ventilation. METHODS: This was a single-center, prospective, observational cohort study on 383 mechanically ventilated ED patients. After extubation, we assessed patients for awareness with paralysis by using the modified Brice questionnaire. Three expert reviewers independently adjudicated awareness with paralysis. We report the prevalence of awareness with paralysis (primary outcome); the secondary outcome was perceived threat, a mediator for development of posttraumatic stress disorder. RESULTS: The prevalence of awareness with paralysis was 2.6% (10/383). Exposure to rocuronium at any point in the ED was significantly different between patients who experienced awareness with paralysis (70%) versus the rest of the cohort (31.4%) (unadjusted odds ratio 5.1; 95% confidence interval 1.30 to 20.1). Patients experiencing awareness with paralysis had higher mean values on the threat perception scale, denoting a higher degree of perceived threat, compared with patients who did not experience awareness with paralysis (13.4 [SD 7.7] versus 8.5 [SD 6.2]; mean difference 4.9; 95% confidence interval 0.94 to 8.8). CONCLUSION: Awareness with paralysis occurs in a significant minority of ED patients who receive mechanical ventilation. Potential associations of awareness with paralysis with ED care and increased perceived threat warrant further evaluation.","Pappal, Ryan D; Roberts, Brian W; Mohr, Nicholas M; Ablordeppey, Enyo; Wessman, Brian T; Drewry, Anne M; Winkler, Winston; Yan, Yan; Kollef, Marin H; Avidan, Michael S; Fuller, Brian M",Ann Emerg Med,99,16

The treatment of the congestive phase then the background outpatient treatment of the heart failure were initiated, on the spot thanks to cardiological teleconsultation (TLC) and robotized telechocardiography (TER). Method The TER device (Melody ®) is a non-invasive remote cardiac imaging technique, configured as follows: the expert site (CHU Guadeloupe), the patient site (CHSM). The articulated arm of the robot, equipped with the echocardiography probe on its outside, is positioned on the patient's thorax by the tele-assistant nurse. The cardiologist takes the dummy probe in hand and remotely controls the robot, which reproduces the movements of his or her hand precisely and synchronously. The digital control unit and the reading of the echographic image allow him to parameterize the echocardiography in real time. The videoconference (Courbaril ®) allows the dialogue between the cardiologist and the patient or the tele-assistant nurse (Fig. 1). Results The first TER mainly showed a dilated cardiomyopathy, a LV severely hypokinetic, the LV ejection fraction was estimated to 15–20%, with a moderate intra LV contrast, and high LV filling pressures. The RV was dilated, moderately hypokinetic. A PAH at 76mmHg. A moderate pericardial and bilateral pleural effusion. Few pulmonary comet tails. The second TER, performed 6 weeks later showed a normalization of the LV size with improved ejection fraction to 58%.

In the United States, planned out-of-hospital births are associated with significantly increased risks of neonatal morbidity and death. In addition, there are obstetric emergencies during out-of-hospital births that can lead to adverse outcomes, partly because of the delay in transporting the woman to the hospital. In other countries with well-integrated obstetric services and well-trained midwives, the differences in outcomes of planned hospital birth and planned home birth are smaller. Women are empowered to make informed decisions when the obstetrician makes ethically justified recommendations, which is known as directive counseling. Recommendations are ethically justified when the outcomes of one form of management is clinically superior to another. The outcomes of morbidity and mortality and of infection control and prevention of planned hospital birth are clinically superior to those of out-of-hospital birth. The obstetrician therefore should recommend planned hospital birth and recommend against planned out-of-hospital birth during the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has increased stress levels for all patients and even more so for pregnant patients and their families. The response in this difficult time should be to mitigate this stress and empower women to make informed decisions by routinely providing counseling that is evidence-based and directive.","Grünebaum, Amos; McCullough, Laurence B; Bornstein, Eran; Klein, Risa; Dudenhausen, Joachim W; Chervenak, Frank A",J Perinat Med,99,16

The greatest threat that is disrupting the normal functioning of society is the exceptionally high species independent transmission. Drug repurposing is understood to be the best strategy to immediately deploy well-characterized agents against new pathogens. Several repurposable drugs are already in evaluation for determining suitability to treat COVID-19. One such promising compound includes heparin, which is widely used in reducing thrombotic events associated with COVID-19 induced pathology. As part of identifying target-specific antiviral compounds among FDA and world-approved libraries using high-throughput virtual screening (HTVS), we previously evaluated top hits for anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. Here, we report results of highly efficacious viral entry blocking properties of heparin (IC50 = 12.3 nM) in the complete virus assay, and further, propose ways to use it as a potential transmission blocker. Exploring further, our in-silico analysis indicated that the heparin interacts with post-translational glycoconjugates present on spike proteins. The patterns of accessible spike-glycoconjugates in open and closed states are completely contrasted by one another. Heparin-binding to the open conformation of spike structurally supports the state and may aid ACE2 binding as reported with cell surface-bound heparan sulfate. We also studied spike protein mutant variants' heparin interactions for possible resistance. Based on available data and optimal absorption properties by the skin, heparin could potentially be used to block SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Studies should be designed to exploit its nanomolar antiviral activity to formulate heparin as topical or inhalation-based formulations, particularly on exposed areas and sites of primary viremia e.g. ACE2 rich epithelia of the eye (conjunctiva/lids), nasal cavity, and mouth.","Gupta, Yash; Maciorowski, Dawid; Zak, Samantha E; Kulkarni, Chandrashekhar V; Herbert, Andrew S; Durvasula, Ravi; Fareed, Jawed; Dye, John M; Kempaiah, Prakasha",Int J Biol Macromol,99,20

The benefit of machine learning, as an essential aspect of artificial intelligence, on past epidemics offers a new line to tackle the novel Coronavirus outbreak. Accurate short-term forecasting of COVID-19 spread plays an essential role in improving the management of the overcrowding problem in hospitals and enables appropriate optimization of the available resources (i.e., materials and staff).This paper presents a comparative study of machine learning methods for COVID-19 transmission forecasting. We investigated the performances of deep learning methods, including the hybrid convolutional neural networks-Long short-term memory (LSTM-CNN), the hybrid gated recurrent unit-convolutional neural networks (GAN-GRU), GAN, CNN, LSTM, and Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM), as well as baseline machine learning methods, namely logistic regression (LR) and support vector regression (SVR). The employment of hybrid models (i.e., LSTM-CNN and GAN-GRU) is expected to eventually improve the forecasting accuracy of COVID-19 future trends. The performance of the investigated deep learning and machine learning models was tested using confirmed and recovered COVID-19 cases time-series data from seven impacted countries: Brazil, France, India, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and the US. The results reveal that hybrid deep learning models can efficiently forecast COVID-19 cases. Also, results confirmed the superior performance of deep learning models compared to the two considered baseline machine learning models. Furthermore, results showed that LSTM-CNN achieved improved performances with an averaged mean absolute percentage error of 3.718%, among others.","Dairi, Abdelkader; Harrou, Fouzi; Zeroual, Abdelhafid; Hittawe, Mohamad Mazen; Sun, Ying",J Biomed Inform,99,1

This paper reflects upon the proposition of public libraries as health literate multi-purpose workspaces for improving health literacy. We draw upon our combined experiences as evaluators of organizational health literacy initiatives, and library sector development, engagement and advocacy. Key ideas were presented as part of the 2020 State Library Victoria seminar series on 'Libraries: The Heart of a Healthy Community'. Key messages included: Public libraries are well positioned to contribute to the health literacy movement, as they provide the general public with: universal free access to information and services; extensive in-house and outreach educational collaborative learning opportunities; and health and wellbeing support by being welcoming, safe, and trusted community spaces. To date, limited discussion exists about conceptualizing public libraries as health literate multi-purpose workspaces for supporting and sustaining public library health literacy efforts. A health literate organizational framework is suggested to support libraries simply supporting health information literacy to being recognised as health literate organizations. Five workspace principles (empowerment, equitable, inclusive, collaborative and integrated) are suggested to provide directions for public libraries as health literate multi-purpose workspaces for improving the health literacy of individuals, communities, organizations and indeed systems. To inform the design, implementation and evaluation of public libraries as workspaces for improving health literacy, key principles-focused evaluation questions are suggested for consideration. SO WHAT?: Public Libraries as welcoming, safe, and trusted community organizations are well placed to be health literate multipurpose workspaces for improving health literacy.","Naccarella, Lucio; Horwood, Jacqui",Health Promot J Austr,99,26

DESIGN: Network-based viral transmission risks in households, schools, workplaces, and a variety of community spaces and activities were simulated in an agent-based model, Covasim. SETTING: The model was calibrated for a baseline scenario reflecting the epidemiological and policy environment in Victoria during March-May 2020, a period of low community viral transmission. INTERVENTION: Policy changes for easing COVID-19-related restrictions from May 2020 were simulated in the context of interventions that included testing, contact tracing (including with a smartphone app), and quarantine. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Increase in detected COVID-19 cases following relaxation of restrictions. RESULTS: Policy changes that facilitate contact of individuals with large numbers of unknown people (eg, opening bars, increased public transport use) were associated with the greatest risk of COVID-19 case numbers increasing; changes leading to smaller, structured gatherings with known contacts (eg, small social gatherings, opening schools) were associated with lower risks. In our model, the rise in case numbers following some policy changes was notable only two months after their implementation. CONCLUSIONS: Removing several COVID-19-related restrictions within a short period of time should be undertaken with care, as the consequences may not be apparent for more than two months. Our findings support continuation of work from home policies (to reduce public transport use) and strategies that mitigate the risk associated with re-opening of social venues.","Scott, Nick; Palmer, Anna; Delport, Dominic; Abeysuriya, Romesh; Stuart, Robyn M; Kerr, Cliff C; Mistry, Dina; Klein, Daniel J; Sacks-Davis, Rachel; Heath, Katie; Hainsworth, Samuel W; Pedrana, Alisa; Stoove, Mark; Wilson, David; Hellard, Margaret E",Med. j.

This approach, however, still requires improvement for its efficient application. In this paper, we present the use of wastewater-based epidemiology in monitoring COVID-19 infection dynamics in the KwaZulu-Natal province of South Africa, focusing on four wastewater treatment plants for 14 weeks. The SARS-CoV-2 viral load in influent wastewater was determined using droplet digital PCR, and the number of people infected was estimated using published models as well as using a modified model to improve efficiency. On average, viral loads ranged between 0 and 2.73 × 105 copies/100 ml, 0-1.52 × 105 copies/100 ml, 3 × 104-7.32 × 105 copies/100 ml and 1.55 × 104-4.12 × 105 copies/100 ml in the four wastewater treatment plants studied. The peak in viral load corresponded to the reported COVID-19 infections within the districts where these catchments are located. In addition, we also observed that easing of lockdown restrictions by authorities corresponded with an increase in viral load in the untreated wastewater. Estimation of infection numbers based on the viral load showed that a higher number of people could potentially be infected, compared to the number of cases reported based on clinical testing. The findings reported in this paper contribute to the field of wastewater-based epidemiology for COVID-19 surveillance, whilst highlighting some of the challenges associated with this approach, especially in developing countries.","Pillay, Leanne; Amoah, Isaac Dennis; Deepnarain, Nashia; Pillay, Kriveshin; Awolusi, Oluyemi Olatunji; Kumari, Sheena; Bux, Faizal",Sci Total Environ,99,24

Overall, children appear to be less frequently infected by, and affected by, SARS-CoV-2 virus and the clinical disease COVID-19. Large epidemiological studies have revealed children represent less than 2% of the total confirmed COVID-19 cases, of whom the majority experience minimal or mild disease that do not require hospitalisation. Children do not appear to be major drivers of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, with minimal secondary virus transmission demonstrated within families, schools and community settings. There are several postulated theories regarding the relatively low SARS-CoV-2 morbidity and mortality seen in children, which largely relate to differences in immune responses compared to adults, as well as differences in angiotensin converting enzyme 2 distribution that potentially limits viral entry and subsequent inflammation, hypoxia and tissue injury. The recent emergence of a multisystem inflammatory syndrome bearing temporal and serological plausibility for an immune-mediated SARS-CoV-2-related disease entity is currently under investigation. This article summarises the current available data regarding SARS-CoV-2 and the paediatric population, including the spectrum of disease in children, the role of children in virus transmission, and host-virus factors that underpin the unique aspects of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity in children.","Williams, Phoebe C M; Howard-Jones, Annaleise R; Hsu, Peter; Palasanthiran, Pamela; Gray, Paul E; McMullan, Brendan J; Britton, Philip N; Bartlett, Adam W",Pathology,99,3

This uncertainty is because of the reported scarcity of InsR in lamellar tissue and the low affinity of insulin for equine IGF-1R. In the present study, the effects of insulin and IGF-1 (as a positive control) were examined using lamellar explants isolated from the hooves of healthy horses and incubated in cell culture medium for between 2 min and 48 h. In this system, a low physiological concentration of IGF-1 (10 nM; 1.31 ng/mL) caused a marked increase in the appearance of phosphorylated IGF-1R after 5 min (P < 0.05), and this effect was blocked by a human anti-IGF-1R monoclonal antibody (mAb). However, a high concentration of insulin (10 nM; 1,430 µIU/mL) appeared to cause dephosphorylation of the IGF-1R after 5 min (P < 0.01), 15 min, and 30 min (P < 0.001). Using 3H-thymidine as a marker, it was also demonstrated that insulin and IGF-1-stimulated cell proliferation in lamellar explants over the same concentration range as each other (1-100 nM), implying that each peptide acts via its own receptor (P < 0.001). Conversely, the effect of both peptides could be blocked using a selective anti-IGF-1R mAb (P < 0.001), implying that insulin acts via IGF1-R (either directly or indirectly). Notwithstanding this conundrum, the results demonstrate that insulin acts directly on lamellar tissue and suggest that a therapeutic anti-IGF-1R mAb could be useful in treating or preventing endocrinopathic laminitis.","Rahnama, S; Spence, R; Vathsangam, N; Baskerville, C L; Bailey, S R; de Laat, M A; Anderson, S T; Pollitt, C C; Sillence, M N",Domest Anim Endocrinol,99,4

Gender-blind programs are known to augment harms associated with violence and structural stigmatization by reinforcing rather than challenging unequal systems of power. The intersecting marginalization of these populations with systems of class, race, and settler-colonialism is exacerbating the impact that policies such as physical distancing, school closures, and a realignment of healthcare priorities are having on the wellbeing of these populations. The overarching reasons why women and SGM are marginalized are well known and stem from a hegemonic, patriarchal system that fails to fully integrate these groups into planning and decision making regarding public health programming-including the response to COVID-19. In this perspective, we aim to highlight how the exclusion of cisgender women and SGM, and failure to use a gender redistributive/transformative approach, has (i) hampered the recovery from the pandemic and (ii) further entrenched the existing power structures that lead to the marginalization of these groups. We also argue that COVID-19 represents a once-in-a-century opportunity to realign priorities regarding health promotion for cisgender women and SGM by using gender redistributive/transformative approaches to the recovery from the pandemic. We apply this framework, which aims to challenge the existing power structures and distribution of resources, to exemplars from programs in health, housing, employment, and incarceration to envision how a gender redistributive/transformative approach could harness the COVID-19 recovery to advance health equity for cisgender women and SGM.","Perri, Melissa; Metheny, Nick; Matheson, Flora I; Potvin, Kelly; O039,; Campo, Patricia",Health promot. internation,99,24

We describe characteristics and outcomes of confirmed ARDS in COVID-19 patients managed with invasive mechanical ventilation (MV). METHODS: This is a multicenter, prospective, observational study in consecutive, mechanically ventilated patients with ARDS (as defined by the Berlin criteria) affected with with COVID-19 (confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in nasal or pharyngeal swab specimens), admitted to a network of 36 Spanish and Andorran intensive care units (ICUs) between March 12 and June 1, 2020. We examined the clinical features, ventilatory management, and clinical outcomes of COVID-19 ARDS patients, and compared some results with other relevant studies in non-COVID-19 ARDS patients. RESULTS: A total of 742 patients were analysed with complete 28-day outcome data: 128 (17.1%) with mild, 331 (44.6%) with moderate, and 283 (38.1%) with severe ARDS. At baseline, defined as the first day on invasive MV, median (IQR) values were: tidal volume 6.9 (6.3-7.8) ml/kg predicted body weight, positive end-expiratory pressure 12 (11-14) cmH2O. Values of respiratory system compliance 35 (27-45) ml/cmH2O, plateau pressure 25 (22-29) cmH2O, and driving pressure 12 (10-16) cmH2O were similar to values from non-COVID-19 ARDS patients observed in other studies. Recruitment maneuvers, prone position and neuromuscular blocking agents were used in 79%, 76% and 72% of patients, respectively. The risk of 28-day mortality was lower in mild ARDS [hazard ratio (RR) 0.56 (95% CI 0.33-0.93), p = 0.026] and moderate ARDS [hazard ratio (RR) 0.69 (95% CI 0.47-0.97), p = 0.035] when compared to severe ARDS. The 28-day mortality was similar to other observational studies in non-COVID-19 ARDS patients. CONCLUSIONS: In this large series, COVID-19 ARDS patients have features similar to other causes of ARDS, compliance with lung-protective ventilation was high, and the risk of 28-day mortality increased with the degree of ARDS severity.","Ferrando, Carlos; Suarez-Sipmann, Fernando; Mellado-Artigas, Ricard; Hernández, María; Gea, Alfredo; Arruti, Egoitz; Aldecoa, César; Martínez-Pallí, Graciela; Martínez-González, Miguel A; Slutsky, Arthur S; Villar, Jesús",Intensive care med,99,16

By exploiting the so-called differential contact intensity and the infectious rate in susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) epidemic model, the resultant optimization problem can be transformed into the minimum weight vertex cover (MWVC) problem of graph theory. To solve this problem in a high-dynamic random network topology, we propose an adaptive scheme by relying on the graph embedding technique during the state representation and reinforcement learning in the training phase. By relying on a pair of real-life datasets, the results demonstrate that our scheme can beneficially reduce the epidemiological reproduction rate of the infection.

The compound's drug-like behaviors were studied using HOMO-LUMO analysis. The homology modeling of SARS CoV-2 RdRp was done utilizing the PDB 6NUR_A as a template. The model showed above 99% similarity with its preceder SARS CoV. The molecular docking analysis of the synthesized compounds was carried out along with some suggested drugs for COVID-19 and some phytochemicals. The docking results were then analyzed. The binding free energy of the complexes were calculated using MM-PB(GB)SA and ADMET properties of Ia and Ib were also predicted. Some suggestions are given from this analysis.","Venkateshan, M.; Muthu, M.; Suresh, J.; Ranjith Kumar, R.",J. Mol. Struct.,99,1

In the absence of such specific treatment modalities, the mainstay of public health response rests on non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), such as social distancing. This paper contributes to the understanding of social distancing against SARS-CoV-2 by quantitatively analysing the statistical dynamics of disease propagation as a differential game, and estimating the relative costs of distancing versus not distancing, identifying marginal utility of distancing based on known population epidemiological data about SARS-CoV-2 and concluding that unless the costs of distancing vastly exceed the cost of illness per unit time, social distancing remains a dominant strategy. These findings can assist in solidly anchoring public health responses based on social distancing within a quantitative framework attesting to their effectiveness.","Csefalvay, Chris von",,99,16

However, most patients included in those studies underwent polysomnography because of symptoms, so the prevalence of sleep disordered breathing in this population is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of sleep disordered breathing in children with myelomeningocele using screening polysomnography. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, all children with myelomeningocele seen in a multi-disciplinary spina bifida clinic between 2016 and 2020 were referred for polysomnography regardless of clinical symptoms. Included children had not previously undergone polysomnography. The primary outcome for this study was presence of sleep disordered breathing, defined as Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI, number of apnea or hypopnea events per hour of sleep) greater than 2.5. Clinical and demographic variables relevant to myelomeningocele were also prospectively collected and tested for association with presence of sleep apnea. RESULTS: A total of 117 participants underwent polysomnography (age 1 mo to 21 yr, 49% male). The majority were white, non-Hispanic. Median AHI was 1.9 (interquartile range 0.6-4.2). A total of 49 children had AHI 2.5 or greater, yielding a sleep disordered breathing prevalence of 42% (95% CI 33%-51%). In multivariable logistic regression analysis, children with more rostral neurological lesion levels had higher odds of sleep disordered breathing (OR for thoracic, mid-lumbar, and low-lumbar: 7.34, 3.70, 4.04, respectively, compared to sacral level, P = .043). CONCLUSION: Over 40% of a sample of children with myelomeningocele, who underwent screening polysomnography, had significant sleep disordered breathing. Routine screening polysomnography may be indicated in this population.","Rocque, Brandon G; Maddox, Mary Halsey; Hopson, Betsy D; Shamblin, Isaac C; Aban, Inmaculada; Arynchyna, Anastasia A; Blount, Jeffrey P",Neurosurgery,99,2
369102,369102,369102,Letter from the president,15.145295,8.740466,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic is a major international emergency leading to unprecedented medical, economic and societal challenges. Countries around the globe are facing challenges with diabetes care and are similarly adapting care delivery, with local cultural nuances. People with diabetes suffer disproportionately from acute COVID-19 with higher rates of serious complications and death. In-patient services need specialist support to appropriately manage glycaemia in people with known and undiagnosed diabetes presenting with COVID-19. Due to the restrictions imposed by the pandemic, people with diabetes may suffer longer-term harm caused by inadequate clinical support and less frequent monitoring of their condition and diabetes-related complications. Outpatient management need to be reorganised to maintain remote advice and support services, focusing on proactive care for the highest risk, and using telehealth and digital services for consultations, self-management and remote monitoring, where appropriate. Stratification of patients for face-to-face or remote follow-up should be based on a balanced risk assessment. Public health and national organisations have generally responded rapidly with guidance on care management, but the pandemic has created a tension around prioritisation of communicable vs non-communicable disease. Resulting challenges in clinical decision-making are compounded by a reduced clinical workforce. For many years, increasing diabetes mellitus incidence has been mirrored by rising preventable morbidity and mortality due to complications, yet innovation in service delivery has been slow. While the current focus is on limiting the terrible harm caused by the pandemic, it is possible that a positive lasting legacy of COVID-19 might include accelerated innovation in chronic disease management.","Wake, Deborah J; Gibb, Fraser W; Kar, Partha; Kennon, Brian; Klonoff, David C; Rayman, Gerry; Rutter, Martin K; Sainsbury, Chris; Semple, Robert K",Eur J Endocrinol,99,24

The prevalence of bacterial infections in these patients is not well established, and more data are needed to guide empiric antibiotic therapy and improve patient outcomes. Methods: In this prospective multicenter study, we assessed bacterial coinfections identified in culture from 99 French patients infected by SARS-Cov-2 and hospitalized in intensive care units. We concomitantly evaluated an innovative molecular diagnostic technology technique, the BioFire, FilmArray Pneumonia Panel plus (FA-pneumo) assay, to identify these coinfections at an early stage, and its concordance with conventional culture. Results: We showed that a bacterial coinfection was detected in 15% of patients based on conventional culture. Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae were the most prevalent pathogens. The sensitivity of FA-pneumo compared with culture was 100%. In contrast, the specificity varied between 88.4% and 100% according to the pathogen, and our results highlighted that 60.5% of bacterial targets reported using this assay were not recovered by culture; 76.9% of discordant results corresponded to bacteria belonging to commensal oral flora and/or reported with &#8804;105 copies/mL bacterial nucleic acids. Conclusions: Based on its excellent sensitivity, the FA-pneumo assay is useful to rule out bacterial coinfections in the context of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection and avoid the inappropriate prescription of antibiotics. However, positive tests should be interpreted carefully, taking into consideration deoxyribonucleic acid bacterial load and all clinical and biological signs.","Kolenda, Camille; Ranc, Anne-Gaëlle; Boisset, Sandrine; Caspar, Yvan; Carricajo, Anne; Souche, Aubin; Dauwalder, Olivier; Verhoeven, Paul O; Vandenesch, François; Laurent, Frédéric",Open Forum Infect Dis,99,16

Such wave functions have tremendous flexibility, which makes these methods incredibly powerful but can also lead to inconsistencies in the description of the electronic structure of molecules. In this paper, the problems that can arise in vCAS calculations are illustrated by calculations on the BH and BF molecules. BH is well described by the full vCAS wave function, which accounts for molecular dissociation and 2s-2p near-degeneracy in the boron atom. The same is not true for the full vCAS wave function for BF. There is mixing of core and active orbitals at short internuclear distances and swapping of core and active orbitals at large internuclear distances. In addition, the virtual 2&#960; orbitals, which were included in the active space to account for the 2s-2p near degeneracy effect, are used instead to describe radial correlation of the electrons in the F2p&#960;-like pairs. Although the above changes lead to lower vCAS energies, they lead to higher vCAS+1+2 energies as well as irregularities and/or discontinuities in the potential energy curves. All of the above problems can be addressed by using the spin-coupled generalized valence bond-inspired vCAS wave function for BF, which includes only a subset of the atomic valence orbitals in the active space.","Xu, Lu T; Dunning, Thom H",J Chem Phys,99,27

Folliculo-stellate cells do not produce anterior pituitary hormones but they are thought to play important roles as stem cells, phagocytes, or supporting cells of hormone-producing cells in the anterior pituitary. S100ß protein has been used as a folliculo-stellate cell marker in some animals, including rats. However, since no reliable molecular marker for folliculo-stellate cells has been reported in mice, genetic approaches for the investigation of folliculo-stellate cells in mice are not yet available. Aldolase C/Zebrin II is a brain-type isozyme and is a fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase. In the present study, we first used immunohistochemistry to verify that aldolase C was produced in the anterior pituitary of rats. Moreover, using transgenic rats expressing green fluorescent protein under the control of the S100ß gene promoter, we identified aldolase C-immunoreactive signals in folliculo-stellate cells and marginal cells located in the parenchyma of the anterior pituitary and around Rathke's cleft, respectively. We also identified aldolase C-expressing cells in the mouse pituitary using immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. Aldolase C was not produced in any pituitary hormone-producing cells, while aldolase C-immunopositive signal co-localized with E-cadherin- and SOX2-positive cells. Using post-embedding immunoelectron microscopy, aldolase C-immunoreactive products were observed in the cytoplasm of marginal cells and folliculo-stellate cells of the mouse pituitary.

We explored the efficacy and safety of &#8805; 12-month DAPT among MMACS patients. METHODS: In this sub-analysis of the optimal antiplatelet therapy for Chinese Patients with Coronary Artery Disease study (NCT01735305), clinical outcomes among MMACS patients were compared between the < 12-month and &#8805; 12-month DAPT groups. The primary efficacy endpoint was a composite of cardiac death, myocardial infarction, and stroke. Safety endpoints included the Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC) 2-5, BARC 3-5, and all bleeding events. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to compare baseline characteristics between the < 12-month and &#8805; 12-month DAPT groups. RESULTS: In this cohort of ACS patients (n = 10,016), MMACS patients (n = 2967) were less likely to use DAPT at 12 (31.64% vs. 67.47%, P < 0.0001) and 24 (13.82% vs. 18.71%, P < 0.0001) months and experienced more ischemic events at 12 (4.55% vs. 3.40%, P = 0.006) and 24 (6.88% vs. 5.08%, P = 0.0004) months than those treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (n = 7049). Among MMACS patients, the rate of primary efficacy endpoint occurring within the second year was significantly higher in the < 12-month DAPT group than in the &#8805; 12-month group both before (2.88% vs. 1.60%, P = 0.040) and after (3.19% vs. 1.71%, P = 0.045) PSM. After PSM, no significant differences in all bleeding, BARC 2-5, and BARC 3-5 bleeding were found between the groups. CONCLUSION: MMACS patients with insufficient DAPT management experienced relatively more ischemic events. DAPT for at least 1 year may be beneficial to this special population without significantly increasing the bleeding risks.

We empirically investigate how power systems in five European countries have dealt with this unexpected shock, drastically changing electricity load, the scheduling of dispatchable generation technologies, electricity day-ahead wholesale prices, and balancing costs. We find that low-cost dispatchable generation from hydro and nuclear sources has fulfilled most of the net-load even during peak hours, replacing more costly fossil-based generation. In Germany, the UK, and Spain coal power plants stood idle, while gas-fired generation has responded in heterogeneous ways across power systems. Falling operational costs of generators producing at the margin and lower demand, both induced by COVID-19 lockdowns, have significantly decreased wholesale prices. Balancing and other ancillary services' markets have provided the flexibility required to respond to the exceptional market conditions faced by the grid. Balancing costs for flexibility services have increased heterogeneously across countries, while ancillary markets' costs, measured only in the case of Italy, have increased substantially. Results provide valuable evidence on current systems' dynamics during high renewables' shares and increased demand volatility.

With this study, we aimed to better understand the relationship between maternal infection and perinatal outcomes, especially preterm births, and the underlying medical and interventionist factors. This was a prospective observational study carried out in 78 centers (Spanish Obstetric Emergency Group) with a cohort of 1347 SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive pregnant women registered consecutively between 26 February and 5 November 2020, and a concurrent sample of PCR-negative mothers. The patients' information was collected from their medical records, and the association of SARS-CoV-2 and perinatal outcomes was evaluated by univariable and multivariate analyses. The data from 1347 SARS-CoV-2-positive pregnancies were compared with those from 1607 SARS-CoV-2-negative pregnancies. Differences were observed between both groups in premature rupture of membranes (15.5% vs. 11.1%, p < 0.001); venous thrombotic events (1.5% vs. 0.2%, p < 0.001); and severe pre-eclampsia incidence (40.6 vs. 15.6%, p = 0.001), which could have been overestimated in the infected cohort due to the shared analytical signs between this hypertensive disorder and COVID-19. In addition, more preterm deliveries were observed in infected patients (11.1% vs. 5.8%, p < 0.001) mainly due to an increase in iatrogenic preterm births. The prematurity in SARS-CoV-2-affected pregnancies results from a predisposition to end the pregnancy because of maternal disease (pneumonia and pre-eclampsia, with or without COVID-19 symptoms).","Cruz Melguizo, Sara; de la Cruz Conty, María Luisa; Carmona Payán, Paola; Abascal-Saiz, Alejandra; Pintando Recarte, Pilar; González Rodríguez, Laura; Cuenca Marín, Celia; Martínez Varea, Alicia; Oreja Cuesta, Ana Belén; Rodríguez, Pilar Prats; Fernández Buhigas, Irene; Rodríguez Gallego, María Victoria; Fernández Alonso, Ana María; López Pérez, Rocío; Broullón Molanes, José Román; Encinas Pardilla, María Begoña; Ramírez Gómez, Mercedes; Gimeno Gimeno, María Joaquina; Sánchez Muñoz, Antonio; Martínez-Pérez, Oscar",Viruses,99,16

It is intracellularly metabolized into the active triphosphate form, which in turn acts as a potent and selective inhibitor of multiple viral RNA polymerases. RDV has broad-spectrum activity against members of the coronavirus family such as SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV, as well as filoviruses and paramyxoviruses. To assess potential for off-target toxicity, RDV was evaluated in a set of cellular and biochemical assays. Cytotoxicity was evaluated in a set of relevant human cell lines and primary cells. In addition, RDV was evaluated for mitochondrial toxicity under aerobic and anaerobic metabolic conditions, and for the effects on mitochondrial DNA content, mitochondrial protein synthesis, cellular respiration, and induction of reactive oxygen species. Lastly, the active 5'-triphosphate metabolite of RDV, GS-443902, was evaluated for potential interaction with human DNA and RNA polymerases. Among all of the human cells tested under 5-14 days of continuous exposure, RDV's CC50 values ranged from 1.7 to >20 µM, resulting in selectivity indices (SI, CC50/EC50) from >170 to 20,000, with respect to RDV anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity (EC50 of 9.9 nM in human airway epithelial cells). Overall, the cellular and biochemical assays demonstrated a low potential of RDV for off-target toxicity including mitochondria-specific toxicity, consistent with the reported clinical safety profile.","Xu, Yili; Barauskas, Ona; Kim, Cynthia; Babusis, Darius; Murakami, Eisuke; Kornyeyev, Dmytro; Lee, Gary; Stepan, George; Perron, Michel; Bannister, Roy; Schultz, Brian E; Sakowicz, Roman; Porter, Danielle; Cihlar, Tomas; Feng, Joy Y",,99,22

To control this outbreak, many governments in the world have imposed lockdown or quarantine measures. We hypothesize that these measures may cause additional mortality and morbidity in the (near) future due to delay in diagnosing diseases and other indirect effect on health (such as economic crisis). To support this hypothesis and to estimate the additional mortality that may linked to the COVID-19 controlling policy, we performed a step-by-step pragmatical approach. First, we chose a country (The Netherlands), and looked at the most common causes of mortality in this country. Then, we performed a literature study on the additional mortality when these causes were diagnosed late, and selected a paper with the most severe scenario. We also performed a literature study on the effect of economic crisis on additional mortality. The mortality data were then extrapolated to the demography of The Netherlands, and the results were compared with the present data on deaths directly due to COVID-19. Roughly, we forecast 388 additional deaths a week in The Netherlands in 5 years due to the direct and indirect effects of the lockdown measures. The most important implications of this hypothesis is that the additional mortality and increased mental health problem should be considered in evaluating the necessity of lock down and quarantine policy.","Yusuf, Erlangga; Tisler, Anna",Med Hypotheses,99,20
380062,380062,380062,Rethinking the causes of pilonidal sinus disease: a matched cohort study,15.446858,8.527903,2021,"BACKGROUND: Spinal neuroarthropathy (SNA), also known as Charcot spine, is an uncommon aggressive arthropathy, secondary to loss of proprioceptive and nociceptive feedback from the spine. A diagnosis of SNA is frequently delayed due to the scarcity of symptoms in its early stages, leading to significant neurological deterioration. Therefore, prompt suspicion of the disease is critical to providing better outcomes. This case assembles two rare characteristics of SNA: diabetic aetiology and a precocious time of diagnosis, and aims to highlight the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings that allowed for the diagnosis. CASE PRESENTATION: A 44-year-old woman, with long-term type 1 diabetes, presented with a two-month history of progressive lumbar pain, difficulty in maintaining an upright position, and discrete trunk forward-leaning. Diabetes-related vasculopathy and nephropathy were already known, and laboratory test results did not show any new abnormalities. A lumbar MRI revealed extensive signal intensity changes of the L2 and L3 vertebral bodies associated with marginal areas of enhancement and the involvement of regions adjacent to interapophyseal articulations and spinous processes from L2-L3 to L5-S1, in association with degenerative changes of the thoracolumbar spine. These findings were identified by the radiologist as suggestive of SNA. To rule out neoplastic and infectious disease, a bone biopsy at the L2-L3 level was executed. The pathology report revealed intervertebral disc material and fragments of fibrous tissue, with a complete absence of inflammatory cells. It was decided to perform a six-month MRI follow-up, which showed stability of the findings, confirming the hypothesis of Charcot spine. The patient was under clinical and radiological follow-up and did not require surgical fixation at the moment of diagnosis. After 2.5 years from the initial diagnosis, a new MRI revealed progression of the lesions with oedema and enlarged paravertebral soft tissues; these findings are compatible with the patient's latest complaints of lumbar pain recurrence. CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report of an MRI-based early diagnosis of diabetic SNA, a rare disease with nonspecific symptoms in its initial stages and a wide spectrum of differential diagnoses. The MRI findings, distinctly the involvement of both anterior and posterior spinal elements, were the key to allowing for the proper diagnosis. A precocious diagnosis, although challenging, is fundamental to providing early intervention and to preventing further neurological impairment.","Nedel, Barbara Limberger; Duarte, Juliana Avila; Gerchman, Fernando",BMC Neurol,99,29

In this Essay, it is argued that such agents already exist and are readily available while highlighting the challenges that remain to translate them into the clinic. Multivalent inhibitors of viral infectivity based on polymers or supramolecular agents and nanoparticles are shown to be broadly acting against diverse pathogens in vitro as well as in vivo. Furthermore, uniquely, such agents can be virucidal. Polymers and nanoparticles are stable, do not require cold chain of transportation and storage, and can be obtained on large scale. Specifically, for the treatment of respiratory viruses and pulmonary diseases, these agents can be administered via inhalation/nebulization, as is currently investigated in clinical trials as a treatment against SARS CoV-2/Covid-19. It is believed that with due optimization and clinical validation, multivalent inhibitors of viral infectivity can claim their rightful position as broad-spectrum antiviral agents.","Zelikin, Alexander N; Stellacci, Francesco",Adv Healthc Mater,99,2

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Materials and methods: 4 focus group interviews were conducted in residents of Ukraine, with a total quantity of 48 people aged 16-70 years questioned and an anonymous questionnaire was conducted in 1,700 respondents, representing the adult population aged 18 years and older from all over Ukraine. The representative error of the study with probability of 0.95 does not exceed 4%. The processing of questionnaires was carried out by SDU Center of Social Researches (SDUCSR) employees, using the OSA program. RESULTS: Results: 28.5% of respondents believe that politicians and media underestimate the danger of the COVID-19 epidemic, while other 28.1% believe that politicians and media adequately assess its danger. 18.9% of respondents are sure that the danger is exaggerated. As much as 24.5% of Ukrainian respondents could not decide on such assessment. The most common sources of information about disease/treatment are Internet and social media. Traditional media and relatives/acquaints who endured the COVID-19 also gain population`s confidence. A family doctor is the least popular source of information. 42.1% of respondents do not trust official information on the number of infected people and severity of the disease, and another 40% are not sure whether they should trust or not. Only 17.9% of respondents trust official information. CONCLUSION: Conclusions: Within informing the society about public health in conditions of a COVID-19 pandemic it is better to provide communication strategy for various target audiences: for youth which is inclined to underestimate threats of epidemic and obtains information on social networks;for people of a retirement age (as risk group) who lack information because they use only traditional media (mainly TV);for women who need psychological support to decrease in level of stress in the family more often and also to overcome the negative post-stressful situations (connected with the death of the family/relatives);for men who are inclined to neglect their own health, etc.;for the people who have endured COVID-19 to prevent possible reinfection in them.","Kostenko, A.

We assessed the effect of the pandemic on the disruption of institutional delivery care in Nepal. Methods: We conducted a prospective cohort study among 52 356 women in nine hospitals to assess the disruption of institutional delivery care during the pandemic (comparing March to August in 2019 with the same months in 2020). We also conducted a nested follow up cohort study with 2022 women during the pandemic to assess their provision and experience of respectful care. We used linear regression models to assess the association between provision and experience of care with volume of hospital births and women's residence in a COVID-19 hotspot area. Results: The mean institutional births during the pandemic across the nine hospitals was 24 563, an average decrease of 11.6% (P < 0.0001) in comparison to the same time-period in 2019. The institutional birth in high-medium volume hospitals declined on average by 20.8% (P < 0.0001) during the pandemic, whereas in low-volume hospital institutional birth increased on average by 7.9% (P = 0.001). Maternity services halted for a mean of 4.3 days during the pandemic and there was a redeployment staff to COVID-19 dedicated care. Respectful provision of care was better in hospitals with low-volume birth (ß = 0.446, P < 0.0001) in comparison to high-medium-volume hospitals. There was a positive association between women's residence in a COVID-19 hotspot area and respectful experience of care (ß = 0.076, P = 0.001). Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic has had differential effects on maternity services with changes varying by the volume of births per hospital with smaller volume facilities doing better.

Pancreatic injury is a rare finding in the course of the disease, therefore we present a case of case of 46 years old female who developed viral pancreatitis secondary to COVID-19, complicated with new onset diabetes mellitus (DM) and severe diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), an association that was never reported before in literature.Case presentation:We present a 46 years old female with no past medical history who presented to hospital with respiratory distress and altered mental status. Patient presentation complicated with cardiopulmonary arrest, requiring intubation and CPR. Examination revealed tachycardia (105/min), hypotension (82/45) and hypothermia (32.3), obesity (BMI 38), bilateral rhonchi, soft abdomen with negative Collens and Grey-turner signs. Laboratory testing was remarkable for leukocytosis with neutrophilic predominance (17.5 x10(3)/mcL), hyperkalemia (6.6 mmol/L), elevated lipase levels (4248U/L), high-anion gab metabolic acidosis (anion gab 35, arterial pH &lt;7.000), lactatemia, ketosis, negative alcohol screen. CXR showed bilateral dense alveolar infiltrate with peripheral distribution. CT abdomen (Figure-1) showed swelling of the pancreatic tail and fluid at the anterior pararenal space on the left side suggestive of acute pancreatitis. Ultrasound scan was negative for gallbladder stones. CT brain obtained to investigate cause of altered mental status, and was remarkable for 2.5mm intraparenchymal hemorrhage of the right cerebellar hemisphere. Patient was admitted to MICU for management of ARDS secondary to SARS-CoV-19, acute pancreatitis secondary to SARS-CoV-19, severe DKA, intraparenchymal hemorrhage and post cardiac arrest management. Patient expired after 3 days MICU course as result of multi-organ failure. Discussion: Viral pancreatitis is mainly associated with Mumps, Measles, Coxacki, EBV and Hepatitis A virus [2]. In our case, there were no clinical suspicions or laboratory evidence to attribute patient condition for the before-mentioned viruses. The association of both conditions and the absence of other causes of AP support the theory of COVID19-induced pancreatitis in this scenario. AP as a presenting scenario of COVID19 have been rarely reported before [4]. SARS-CoV is known to be associated with development of acute type 1 diabetes milletus, secondary to islets damage in the exocrine and endocrine tissues of the pancreas which express ACE2, this can explains the acute presentation of hyperglycemia and severe diabetic ketoacidosis in our patient who had no past medical history of diabetes.

This study aimed to discover the behaviour of a group of dependent drinkers of spirits during a 33-day period of complete closure of physical stores selling spirits during COVID-19 lockdown in Auckland, New Zealand, March 2020. METHODS: Electronic clinical records of drinkers waitlisted to complete an alcohol detox at the in-patient service were followed from day 1 of lockdown and outcomes at the end of the period analysed. RESULTS: Drinkers of spirits were statistically more successful in stopping drinking (P = 0.002) than those of wine or beer. Only 26% chose to switch to an alternate alcohol type initially. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: A sudden reduction in availability of spirits resulted in positive behaviour change in spirits drinkers compared to those of other alcohol types, aided by the support of detox services. Internet alcohol purchasing, while not used by this group, deserves close future scrutiny due to its potential to increase alcohol availability in dependent drinkers.","Falkner, Carolyn; Neave, Hamish",Drug alcohol rev,99,33

Deductive reasoning supports a previously established goal, but deductive accuracy requires sound premises leading to a valid conclusion. Inductive reasoning uses efficient data sorting, data interpretation, and plan creation without a previously established goal, and allows assessing inferential accuracy over time. In all cases, communication remains the backbone of the clinical encounter. Virtual care for CCD challenges clinical judgement by reducing available information, so even experienced specialists who use induction might default to deduction or abduction. The visit might shorten, decreasing narrative competence and in-turn management quality. Clinical judgement in virtual encounters can be enhanced by allowing sufficient time, employing allied health staff, using an advance script, avoiding dogmatic commitment to either virtual or in-person encounters, special training in virtual care, and conscious awareness of abductive, deductive, and inductive reasoning processes. Clinical judgement in virtual encounters especially calls for Gestalt cognition to assess a situational pattern irreducible to its parts and independent of its particulars, so that efficient data interpretation and self-reflection are enabled. Gestalt cognition integrates abduction, deduction, and induction, appropriately divides the time and effort spent on each, and can compensate for reduced available information. Evaluating one's clinical judgement for those components especially vulnerable to compromise can help optimize the delivery of virtual care for patients with CCD.","Prasad, G V Ramesh",Journal of evaluation in clinical practice (Online),99,12

This age-stratified, serological survey was aimed to measure the COVID-19 distribution and determinants in district Islamabad of Pakistan. MethodologyThree-stage cluster sampling, using population proportionate to size technique, starting with a random number was used. A structured, pretested questionnaire was used after taking informed written consent, to gather demographic, risk factor information. ResultsSeroprevalence was found 16.5% (AR: 16.5%/100,000). The mean age was 35 ({+/-}16 Years). The majority were male (64%), self-employed (29%), and had primary level education (33%). The highest seroprevalence was found in the 21-30 years age group (24.8%) while the 41-50 years age group showed the highest attack rate (112.9/100,000 population). The proportion of the population tested that were asymptomatic was 69% (n=711) while the most frequently reported sign/symptom was cough (99%) followed by fever (20%). No known co-morbidity was reported in 86% (n=884) of respondents while hypertension remained the most reported condition (8%). High seroprevalence was observed in urban areas (12.3%) compared to rural union councils (6.4%). Visiting a house where COVID-19 case was isolated (OR 2, CI 1.38-2.84, P< 0.001), history of contact with a known case of COVID-19 (OR 1.42, CI 1.11-1.82, P=0.005), and attending a mass gathering (OR 1.21, CI: 1.02-1.42, p=0.02) were significant risk factors associated with contracting an infection. A Chi-Square test of independence showed significant protection while using regular hand hygiene practices (6.5; p<0.05) and regular usage of face masks (8.6; p<0.05). ConclusionSeroprevalence gives a direct estimation of population groups exposed to the virus. A remarkable difference in prevalence is found in urban and rural areas, extreme age groups, and socioeconomic statuses, suggesting targeted public health interventions.

We present a case of reversible, symptomatic PH in a patient consuming methamphetamine. Case Presentation A 35-year-old male smoker with a history of hypertension and active methamphetamine abuse presented to the emergency department with progressive dyspnea on exertion for 8 months, with worsening symptoms over the preceding week. He took no medications at home. At presentation, he was hypertensive (218/140 mm Hg) and tachycardic. Physical examination was unremarkable. He was found to be in acute hypoxic respiratory failure, requiring oxygen supplementation via a venturi mask. Labwork at presentation was notable for elevated nt-pro bnp (1572 pg/mL), hypoxia with respiratory alkalosis on arterial blood gas (pH: 7.49;pCO2: 30 mm Hg;pO2: 54.4 mm Hg), and amphetamines on urine toxicology. Respiratory viral panel, including testing for SARS-CoV-2, was negative. Chest imaging, including radiography and computed tomography (CT) with angiography demonstrated no acute pathology. Aggressive control of blood pressure was instituted with lisinopril, hydrochlorothiazide, and amlodipine, along with diuresis and non-invasive ventilatory support. Transthoracic echocardiography with bubble study was notable for right ventricular enlargement and systolic dysfunction, with enlarged right atrium, bidirectional shunt at the atrial level, and high pulmonary artery systolic pressure (83 mm Hg). Rheumatoid factor, anti-double stranded DNA, HIV testing, and serum protein electrophoresis were negative. One week following admission, his respiratory failure improved, and a right heart catheterization was performed, which demonstrated a mean pulmonary artery pressure of 27 mmg Hg, with normal pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (11 mm Hg) and pulmonary vascular resistance (2.5 Woods Units). Transesophageal echocardiography showed normal right ventricular size and function with a moderate right-to-left shunt through a patent foramen ovale. Discussion Methamphetamine is a sympathomimetic amine which can cause adrenergic stimulation by displacing neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine, epinephrine, and serotonin from cytoplasmic vesicles of pre-synaptic neurons. Methamphetamines are associated with a range of pulmonary complications, including PH, pulmonary hemorrhage, and edema. We present a case of transient dynamic PH in the setting of methamphetamine use, which caused severe hypoxic respiratory failure, and abated with cessation of amphetamines and aggressive control of hypertension. Methamphetamine is classified as a “likely” risk factor for PH.(1) Studies have demonstrated worse prognosis in patients with meth-PH compared to idiopathic PH.(2,3) PH should be considered as a differential when encountering respiratory failure in patients who use methamphetamines.","Sharma, N.; Li, S.; Kazmierski, D.

Recent studies suggest that resection of an epileptogenic zone that involves the insula as a treatment for drug-resistant seizures is associated with good outcomes in terms of seizure control. However, despite the existing evidence of a role of the insula in emotions and affective information processing, the long-term psychological outcome of patients undergoing these surgeries remain poorly documented. A group of 27 adults (18 women) who underwent an insulo-opercular resection (in combination with a part of the temporal lobe in 10, and of the frontal lobe in 5) as part of epilepsy surgery at our center between 2004 and 2019 completed psychometric questionnaires to assess depression (Beck Depression Inventory - 2nd edition; BDI-II), anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Trait Version; STAI-T), and quality of life (Patient Weighted Quality of Life In Epilepsy; QOLIE-10-P). Scores were compared to those of patients who had standard temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) surgery with similar socio-demographic and disease characteristics. Seizure control after insular epilepsy surgery was comparable to that observed after TLE surgery, with a majority of patients reporting being seizure free (insular: 63.0%; temporal: 63.2%) or having rare disabling seizures (insular: 7.4%; temporal: 18.4%) at the time of questionnaire completion. Statistical comparisons revealed no significant group difference on scores of depression, anxiety, or quality of life. Hemisphere or extent of insular resection had no significant effect on the studied variables. In the total sample, employment status and seizure control, but not location of surgery, significantly predicted quality of life. Self-reported long-term psychological status after insulo-opercular resection as part of epilepsy surgery thus appears to be similar to that observed after TLE surgery, which is commonly performed in epilepsy surgery centers.","Gravel, Victoria; Boucher, Olivier; Citherlet, Daphné; Hébert-Seropian, Benjamin; Bouthillier, Alain; Nguyen, Dang Khoa",Epilepsy Behav,99,1

This study examines the characteristics and distribution of negative emotions among Chinese nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic and explores regulatory emotional self-efficacy (RESE) as the underlying mechanism in the relationship between nurses' personalities and negative emotions. A cross-sectional design with convenience sampling was utilized. Three comprehensive tertiary hospitals located in China were selected. Nurses (n = 339) who cared for COVID-19 patients were enrolled. Recruitment was conducted between 14 February 2020 and 1 March 2020. Self-reported questionnaires about personality, RESE, and epidemic-related negative emotions were completed online. A correlation analysis, structural equation modelling, and the bootstrapping method were used to analyse the data. This study identified a 24.9% incidence of negative emotions in nurses. RESE was a significant mediator explaining the effect of personality on epidemic-related negative emotions. RESE mediated the effect of introversion-extroversion on depression (ß = -0.151, P = 0.015), neuroticism (ß = -0.182, P = 0.007), fear (ß = -0.142, P = 0.006), anxiety (ß = -0.189, P = 0.015), and hypochondria (ß = -0.118, P = 0.010); it also mediated the effect of neuroticism on depression (ß = 0.313, P = 0.002), neuroticism (ß = 0.394, P = 0.003), fear (ß = 0.345, P = 0.005), anxiety (ß = 0.384, P = 0.003), and hypochondria (ß = 0.259, P = 0.004). Nurses caring for COVID-19 patients displayed negative emotions, particularly emotionally unstable and introverted nurses with a low RESE level. RESE is often essential for interventions because it significantly influences the relationship between personality and negative emotions. In the event of a major outbreak, tailored psychological well-being education, which includes emotional self-efficacy strategies, should be provided by organizations to help nurses manage stress related to the outbreak.","Sui, Weijing; Gong, Xiaoyan; Zhuang, Yiyu",Int. j. ment. health nurs,99,16

We evaluated patients treated with tocilizumab for a SARS-CoV-2 infection who were admitted between 3/13/20 and 4/16/20. This was a multi-center study with data collected by chart review both retrospectively and concurrently. Parameters evaluated included age, sex, race, use of mechanical ventilation (MV), usage of steroids and vasopressors, inflammatory markers, and comorbidities. Early dosing was defined as a tocilizumab dose administered prior to or within one (1) day of intubation. Late dosing was defined as a dose administered greater than one (1) day after intubation. In the absence of mechanical ventilation, the timing of the dose was related to the patient's date of admission only. We evaluated 145 patients.

A recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified small nucleotide polymorphisms that reduce the expression of IGFBP-5 as a risk factor of developing breast cancer. This observation suggests that genetic alterations leading to a decreased level of IGFBP-5 may also contribute to breast cancer. In the current review, we focus on Pregnancy-Associated Plasma Protein A (PAPP-A), a protease involved in the degradation of IGFBP-5. PAPP-A is overexpressed in the majority of breast cancers but its role in cancer has only begun to be explored. More specifically, this review aims at highlighting the role of post-partum involution in the oncogenic function of PAPP-A. Notably, we summarize recent studies indicating that PAPP-A plays a role not only in the degradation of IGFBP-5 but also in the deposition of collagen and activation of the collagen receptor discoidin 2 (DDR2) during post-partum involution. Finally, considering the immunosuppressive microenvironment of post-partum involution, we also discuss the unexpected finding made in Ewing Sarcoma that PAPP-A plays a role in immune evasion. While the immunosuppressive role of PAPP-A in breast cancer remains to be determined, collectively these studies highlight the multifaced role of PAPP-A in cancer that extends well beyond its effect on IGF-signaling.","Jenkins, Edmund Charles; Brown, Samantha O; Germain, Doris",J. mammary gland biol. neoplasia,99,16

In this study, we aimed to further investigate the prevalence and outcomes of COVID-19 patients with digestive symptoms. METHODS: In this descriptive, cross-sectional, multicenter study, we enrolled confirmed patients with COVID-19 who presented to 3 hospitals from January 18, 2020, to February 28, 2020. All patients were confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction and were analyzed for clinical characteristics, laboratory data, and treatment. Data were followed up until March 18, 2020. RESULTS: In the present study, 204 patients with COVID-19 and full laboratory, imaging, and historical data were analyzed. The average age was 52.9 years (SD ± 16), including 107 men and 97 women. Although most patients presented to the hospital with fever or respiratory symptoms, we found that 103 patients (50.5%) reported a digestive symptom, including lack of appetite (81 [78.6%] cases), diarrhea (35 [34%] cases), vomiting (4 [3.9%] cases), and abdominal pain (2 [1.9%] cases). If lack of appetite is excluded from the analysis (because it is less specific for the gastrointestinal tract), there were 38 total cases (18.6%) where patients presented with a gastrointestinal-specific symptom, including diarrhea, vomiting, or abdominal pain. Patients with digestive symptoms had a significantly longer time from onset to admission than patients without digestive symptoms (9.0 days vs 7.3 days). In 6 cases, there were digestive symptoms, but no respiratory symptoms. As the severity of the disease increased, digestive symptoms became more pronounced. Patients with digestive symptoms had higher mean liver enzyme levels, lower monocyte count, longer prothrombin time, and received more antimicrobial treatment than those without digestive symptoms. DISCUSSION: We found that digestive symptoms are common in patients with COVID-19. Moreover, these patients have a longer time from onset to admission, evidence of longer coagulation, and higher liver enzyme levels. Clinicians should recognize that digestive symptoms, such as diarrhea, are commonly among the presenting features of COVID-19 and that the index of suspicion may need to be raised earlier in at-risk patients presenting with digestive symptoms. However, further large sample studies are needed to confirm these findings.","Pan, Lei; Mu, Mi; Yang, Pengcheng; Sun, Yu; Wang, Runsheng; Yan, Junhong; Li, Pibao; Hu, Baoguang; Wang, Jing; Hu, Chao; Jin, Yuan; Niu, Xun; Ping, Rongyu; Du, Yingzhen; Li, Tianzhi; Xu, Guogang; Hu, Qinyong; Tu, Lei",Am J Gastroenterol,99,29

This paper presents: a) the results of a quality improvement project examining the feasibility of in-person evaluation in the context of safety measures that alter test standardization, b) the impact such changes had upon neuropsychological test scores, and c) how using a hybrid model of clinical service delivery affected access to care. METHOD: We compared demographic and outcome variables between patients seen during the pandemic (N = 87) to a group of patients seen in our service immediately prior to COVID-19 (N = 87). A subset of those patients were case-matched for age and diagnosis (N = 39 per group). Children seen for neuropsychological re-evaluation during the pandemic (N = 10) were examined using pairwise comparison. RESULTS: Groups did not differ on age, sex, or FSIQ. Despite changes to standardized administration, no group differences were found for any selected neuropsychological test variables in the larger sample or subsamples. In fact, all variables were moderately to highly correlated in the re-evaluation subgroup. The hybrid model expedited feedback sessions and increased face-to-face (telehealth) feedbacks. CONCLUSIONS: A hybrid model incorporating modified in-person testing and intake and feedback encounters via telehealth may be a feasible and effective way to provide pediatric neuropsychological services. These preliminary findings suggest such novel aspects of neuropsychological evaluation could represent an improvement over pre-COVID models, especially in rural settings.","Lichtenstein, Jonathan D; Amato, Jennifer T; Holding, Emily Z; Grodner, Kelsey D; Pollock, Erica N; Marschall, Kelsea P; Scull, Sara",Arch. clin. neuropsychol,99,20

Originally suspected of having suffered an opiate overdose, it became clear that they were the victims of anti-cholinesterase poisoning-the Soviet era poison Novichok. Twenty-five days later, two further patients were admitted with the same symptoms. One of these patients died 8 days later and the second remained in hospital for 3 weeks. A Clinical Psychologist was present on the unit throughout the major incident and all staff directly involved received psycho-educational support regarding self-care. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To examine the psychological impact of the longest running major incident in NHS history on the staff directly involved. DESIGN: A cross-sectional design was used, with structured questionnaires administered retrospectively. METHODS: A link to an electronic survey was emailed to every member of staff in the organization. The survey included the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Maslach Burnout Inventory, the Impact of Events Scale-Revised (to both the March and June events). RESULTS: 540/4000 hospital staff responded (13.5% response rate) with a 29/59 (49%) response rate in intensive care staff. Frontline staff had significantly lower scores on anxiety (P < .05 for the June incident), depressive symptoms (P < .05 March and June) and subscales of burnout than managers (depersonalization P < .05). On the remaining two burnout subscales and on anxiety scores for those involved in March, results trended towards significance (P < .1).

Decades of international research shows that, across Europe, men have shorter life expectancies and higher mortality rates than women, and yet, women report higher morbidity. These gender-based health inequalities also appear to be evident within the pandemic and its aftermath. The article starts by providing an overview of the 'gender health paradox' and the biological, social, economic and political explanations for it. It then outlines the international estimates of gender-based inequalities in COVID-19 morbidity and mortality rates - where emerging data suggests that women are more likely to be diagnosed with COVID-19 but that men have a higher mortality rate. It then explores the longer term consequences for gender-based health inequalities of the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on the impacts of government policy responses and the emerging economic crisis, suggesting that this might lead to increased mortality amongst men and increased morbidity amongst women. The essay concludes by reflecting on the pathways shaping gender-based health inequalities in the COVID-19 pandemic and the responses needed to ensure that it does not exacerbate gender-based health inequalities into the future.","Bambra, Clare; Albani, Viviana; Franklin, Paula",Scand J Public Health,99,32

The disease has since rapidly evolved, causing a public health emergency throughout the country but especially in our region, one of the most widely affected areas. We reorganized the daily routine of our cancer center to reduce the risk of contagion. A temporary tensile structure was set up as an entry-point triage, and a COVID-19 route was created with a dedicated CT scanner. A pre-access telephonic triage was performed the day before a patient was scheduled to come in for an examination. At the time of writing (May 4), 4053 patients had been to our center since the emergency officially began (9.03.2020) and the COVID-19 route had been activated for only 9 paucisymptomatic outpatients and 7 symptomatic inpatients. We also re-evaluated patient radiology examination lists and rescheduled non-urgent tests in consensus with the referring oncologist. Out of a total of 1438 patients scheduled for radiological examinations, 456 were postponed for a total volume reduction of 29.1%. Nine asymptomatic patients with typical CT findings of COVID-19 were identified during routine CTs, but none were RT-PCR-positive for SARS-CoV-2. We guaranteed all urgent and semi-urgent examinations, including those to stage newly diagnosed cancers and to evaluate response to treatment, ensuring the continuation of the diagnostic and therapeutic pathway of our patients. The measures we took were instrumental in keeping the institute COVID-19-free.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the onset of hand eczema during the COVID-19 pandemic in healthcare workers (HCWs) directly involved in intensive care of COVID-19 patients and HCWs without direct contact with COVID-19 patients. Hereby, we aim at increasing awareness about occupational hand eczema and preventive measures that can be adopted. METHOD: A survey was distributed amongst 114 HCWs at a single surgical centre and at a COVID-19 intensive care unit of the university hospital Ludwig Maximilian University Munich, Germany. Participants were questioned about the daily frequency of hand hygiene prior to and during the pandemic. Participants self-reported the onset of hand eczema and associated symptoms. RESULTS: Our study revealed a significant increase in hand washing, disinfection, and use of hand cream across all participants (P-value <.001), regardless of having direct contact with COVID-19 patients. A high prevalence of symptoms associated with acute hand dermatitis of 90.4% was found across all HCWs, whereas hand eczema itself was underreported (14.9%). CONCLUSION: The increase in hand sanitation during the COVID-19 pandemic impairs the skin of the hands across all HCWs, independent of direct intensive care of affected patients.","Guertler, Anne; Moellhoff, Nicholas; Schenck, Thilo L; Hagen, Christine S; Kendziora, Benjamin; Giunta, Riccardo E; French, Lars E; Reinholz, Markus",Contact Dermatitis,99,1

During the pandemic outbreak, society has become worried about the spread of infections and the shortage of protective equipment. This common fear among the public subsequently deepens each person's fear, increasing their belief in the content reported by the media and thus actively compelling these individuals to engage in the behavior of panic buying. In this study, we explored the effects of the public's risk perception, state anxiety, and trust in social media on the herding effect among individuals. The study was based on an online questionnaire survey and convenience sampling. The results showed that the public's risk perception increased their state anxiety and then deepened their willingness to wait in line for a purchase. In addition, the more people that trust the message delivered by the media, the more actively they will join the queue to buy goods. This study also found that anxiety had a greater impact on the public's willingness to wait for a purchase than trust in social media. Therefore, the top priority for the government should be to reduce the public's state anxiety and then reduce the herding effect.","Lee, Yi-Chih; Wu, Wei-Li; Lee, Chia-Ko",Front Public Health,99,16

Although Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2-immune sera neutralized the Delta variant, when four common mutations were introduced into the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the Delta variant (Delta 4+), some BNT162b2-immune sera lost neutralizing activity and enhanced the infectivity. Unique mutations in the Delta NTD were involved in the enhanced infectivity by the BNT162b2-immune sera. Sera of mice immunized by Delta spike, but not wild-type spike, consistently neutralized the Delta 4+ variant without enhancing infectivity. Given the fact that a Delta variant with three similar RBD mutations has already emerged according to the GISAID database, it is necessary to develop vaccines that protect against such complete breakthrough variants.","Liu, Yafei; Arase, Noriko; Kishikawa, Jun-ichi; Hirose, Mika; Li, Songling; Tada, Asa; Matsuoka, Sumiko; Arakawa, Akemi; Akamatsu, Kanako; Ono, Chikako; Jin, Hui; Kishida, Kazuki; Nakai, Wataru; Kohyama, Masako; Nakagawa, Atsushi; Yamagishi, Yoshiaki; Nakagami, Hironori; Kumanogoh, Atsushi; Matsuura, Yoshiharu; Standley, Daron M; Kato, Takayuki; Okada, Masato; Fujimoto, Manabu; Arase, Hisashi",,99,32

Patients with cardiovascular events had a much higher mortality rate than those without cardiovascular events (45.2% v 8.7%, p < 0.001). There was no difference between African American and white patients regarding mortality (43.9% v 46.3%, p = 1) and length of stay for survivors (11 days v 9.5 days, pâ¯=â¯0.301).

Specifically, we present a novel community-based graph model that represents the emergence of segregated echo chambers as a Markov bridge process. A Markov bridge is a one-dimensional Markov random field that facilitates modeling the formation and disassociation of communities at deterministic times which is important in social networks with known timed events. We justify the proposed model with six real world examples and examine its performance on a recent Twitter dataset. We provide model parameter estimation algorithm based on maximum likelihood and, a Bayesian filtering algorithm for recursively estimating the level of segregation using noisy samples obtained from the network. Numerical results indicate that the proposed filtering algorithm outperforms the conventional hidden Markov modeling in terms of the mean-squared error. The proposed filtering method is useful in computational social science where data-driven estimation of the level of segregation from noisy data is required.","Luo, Rui; Nettasinghe, Buddhika; Krishnamurthy, Vikram",,99,26

However, measles and mumps' resurgence was recently reported, outbreaks still occur, and challenges remain to control these diseases.Areas covered: This qualitative narrative review provides an objective appraisal of the literature regarding current challenges in controlling measles, mumps, rubella infections, and interventions to address them.Expert opinion: While vaccines against measles, mumps, and rubella (including trivalent vaccines) are widely used and effective, challenges to control these diseases are mainly related to insufficient immunization coverage and changing vaccination needs owing to new global environment (e.g. traveling, migration, population density). By understanding disease transmission peculiarities by setting, initiatives are needed to optimize vaccination policies and increase vaccination coverage, which was further negatively impacted by COVID-19 pandemic. Also, awareness of the potential severity of infections and the role of vaccines should increase. Reminder systems, vaccination of disadvantaged, high-risk and difficult-to-reach populations, accessibility of vaccination, healthcare infrastructure, and vaccination services management should improve. Outbreak preparedness should be strengthened, including implementation of high-quality surveillance systems to monitor epidemiology. While the main focus should be on these public health initiatives to increase vaccination coverage, slightly more benefits could come from evolution of current vaccines.Plain Language SummaryWhat is the context? Measles, mumps, and rubella are highly contagious diseases associated with significant medical and societal burden. Effective vaccines against these diseases are available, and the implementation of vaccination programs drastically reduced disease incidence globally. However, reports of measles and mumps outbreaks in the last few years highlight remaining challenges to eliminate these diseases.What does the review highlight? We conducted a literature review to identify challenges associated with controlling measles, mumps, and rubella infections, and interventions needed to address them. We identified 11 challenges mainly related to low immunization coverage and vaccine characteristics. Societal challenges could be addressed by increasing awareness of disease severity and vaccines impact, targeting high-risk, unvaccinated, and under-vaccinated populations, improving vaccination access, setting up clear outbreak preparedness plans, and implementing country-specific vaccination policies. System weaknesses could be addressed through improving vaccination services and health infrastructure, implementing high-quality surveillance, patient invite, and reminder systems, ensuring vaccine implementation and long-term supply. Interventions related to vaccine characteristic challenges could include adaptation of vaccination schedules (shorter interval between doses, administration of a third dose) and development of vaccines against emerging strains.What is the take-home message?Policymakers should support the following strategies to increase vaccination coverage and reach elimination of measles, mumps, and rubella: strengthening health systems and vaccination access; raising awareness of disease severity and vaccination impact; limiting disease propagation owing to global changing environment and population dynamics (traveling, migration); improving surveillance systems to rapidly address the immunity gaps against disease resurgence.","Kauffmann, Florence; Heffernan, Catherine; Meurice, François; Ota, Martin O C; Vetter, Volker; Casabona, Giacomo",Expert Rev Vaccines,99,22

However, there is uncertainty about the mechanistic pathway for such transmissions. Our objective was to identify, appraise and summarise the evidence from primary studies and systematic reviews assessing the role of fomites in transmission. Methods: This review is part of an Open Evidence Review on Transmission Dynamics of SARS-CoV-2. We conduct ongoing searches using WHO Covid-19 Database, LitCovid, medRxiv, and Google Scholar;assess study quality based on five criteria and report important findings on an ongoing basis. Results: We found 64 studies: 63 primary studies and one systematic review (n=35). The settings for primary studies were predominantly in hospitals (69.8%) including general wards, ICU and SARS-CoV-2 isolation wards. There were variations in the study designs including timing of sample collection, hygiene procedures, ventilation settings and cycle threshold. The overall quality of reporting was low to moderate. The frequency of positive SARS-CoV-2 tests across 51 studies (using RT-PCR) ranged from 0.5% to 75%. Cycle threshold values ranged from 20.8 to 44.1. Viral concentrations were reported in 17 studies;however, discrepancies in the methods for estimation prevented comparison. Eleven studies (17.5%) attempted viral culture, but none found a cytopathic effect. Results of the systematic review showed that healthcare settings were most frequently tested (25/35, 71.4%), but laboratories reported the highest frequency of contaminated surfaces (20.5%, 17/83). Conclusions: The majority of studies report identification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA on inanimate surfaces;however, there is a lack of evidence demonstrating the recovery of viable virus. Lack of positive viral cultures suggests that the risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through fomites is low. Heterogeneity in study designs and methodology prevents comparisons of findings across studies. Standardized guidelines for conducting and reporting research on fomite transmission is warranted.","Onakpoya, I. J.; Heneghan, C. J.; Spencer, E. A.; Brassey, J.; Plüddemann, A.; Evans, D.

Various cancer societies have issued recommendations regarding patients care, but few studies addressed the perception of cancer patients regarding this pandemic. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to assess the perception of cancer patients regarding their health risks during this pandemic and the preventive measures taken. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An anonymous survey was conducted among cancer patients presenting for their treatment, during 10 consecutive working days, at the one-day clinic of Hotel-Dieu de France University hospital in Beirut. We evaluated their state of disease, comorbidities, precautions taken, and their concerns regarding the virus spread. RESULTS: A total of 216 patients responded with a mean age of 60 years. The majority had a good performance status (performance status = 0-1 in 79.6%), 51.4% had metastatic disease, and chemotherapy was the main therapy used (65.7%). A total of 52.3% of patients considered themselves to be at increased risk of contracting the virus. A total of 55.1% were more worried about the coronavirus rather than their disease. The priority was for the treatment of their cancer in 47.7% of the total patients studied. Of note, only 2.8% of planned one-day clinic reservations were canceled or postponed to avoid COVID-19 exposure.

Meth could affect the retina and optic nerve by inducing the release of vasoconstrictive agents such as endothelin 1 and induction of severe oxidative stress with accumulation of reactive oxygen species. AIM: To evaluate the effects of chronic Meth abuse on the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL), ganglion cell layer (GCL) and the Bruch's membrane opening minimum rim width (MRW). METHOD: In this case-control study, we recruited 55 Meth abusers and 49 healthy individuals with mean age of 44.63 ± 0.97 and 43.08 ± 0.91 years, respectively. RNFL thickness, GCL thickness and MRW were evaluated using optical coherence tomography. RESULTS: We found statistically significant decrease in RNFL, MRW thickness in Meth abusers (P: 0.002 and P: 0.006, respectively). We did not detect statistically significant difference regarding GCL thickness between the groups (P = 0.320). Our results showed a weak but statistically significant correlation of Meth dose increment and decrement of RNFL thickness ((P: 0.005, r = -0.193) and MRW (P: 0.013, r = -0.174).

OBJECTIVE: To understand effects of the COVID-19 stay-at-home mandate and the inability to participate in recommended and structured physical interventions as a consequence of these mandates, specifically designed mobile assessments were used that collected both self-reporting information and objective task-based metrics of neurocognitive functions to assess symptom changes for individuals with PD. METHODS: Self-reporting questionnaires focusing on overall quality of life (e.g., when individuals typically feel at their best, changes in activity levels, and symptom progression) were given to all individuals (nâ=â28). In addition, mobile-based neurocognitive assessments were administered to a subset of the population (nâ=â8) to quantitatively assess changes due to COVID-19 restrictions. RESULTS: The highest self-reported factors in which individuals denoted feeling their best were after exercise (67.86%) and being in a comfortable and supportive environment (60.71%). Objective measures found overall duration of physical activity during the stay-at-home mandate decreased significantly (pâ=â0.022). With the lack of overall activity, 82.14%of individuals self-reported having at least one symptom that worsened moderately or higher. Further testing, using mobile-based assessments, showed average completion times of functional tasks increased, taking about 2.1 times longer, while accuracy metrics showed overall degradation. CONCLUSION: Although the COVID-19 stay-at-home mandate was intended to help protect individuals at high risk from coming into contact with the virus, it also prevented individuals from receiving recommended supervised exercise interventions resulting in significant negative effects in social well-being and across motor and speech neurocognitive tasks for individuals with PD.","Templeton, John Michael; Poellabauer, Christian; Schneider, Sandra",Journal of Parkinson&#039;s disease (Online),99,16

In April 2020, the nation was shocked by the suicide of New York City emergency physician Dr. Lorna Breen, who died while recovering from COVID-19. She joins an unknown number of clinicians who have taken their lives over the past year. The authors introduce Dr. Breen, a highly talented physician working on the frontlines of the COVID-19 pandemic, and examine how pervasive distress and suicide are in clinicians. Then, they explain the lived experience movement and highlight how clinicians speaking openly about their mental illness and treatment are making it easier for their colleagues to seek lifesaving help, despite the stigma still surrounding mental illness and treatment in medicine. The authors sort through the science of clinician distress; critique how the COVID-19 pandemic is affecting the lives of clinicians; and describe existing national initiatives to address clinician stress, burnout, and suicide. Finally, they recommend evidence-based actions to prevent clinician suicide that multiple stakeholder groups can take, including regulatory agencies, licensing boards, and hospital privileging boards; specialty boards, professional associations, and continuing education organizations; medical educators; and individual clinicians. Suicide is a complex but generally preventable cause of death. Those in medicine must forge ahead with collective momentum. Dr. Breen, so many other clinicians, and those they have left behind deserve nothing less.","Moutier, Christine Yu; Myers, Michael F; Feist, Jennifer Breen; Feist, J Corey; Zisook, Sidney",Acad Med,99,13

Vulnerable populations, such as those living in poverty, experiencing homelessness, or who use drugs, are particularly susceptible to becoming infected with COVID-19 and often have limited access to protective supplies, such as masks and hand sanitizer. Our aim was to understand public opinion on increasing the allocation of COVID-19 prevention resources to vulnerable populations. METHODS: Data were from an online survey of 680 United States adults. Participants' opinions on the allocation of COVID-19 prevention resources to people with low income, experiencing homelessness, or who use drugs were assessed using a five-item Likert scale. We examined the prevalence of these opinions and their relationship to sociodemographic characteristics, COVID-19 beliefs, and drug-related experiences. RESULTS: Most participants supported increasing resources for individuals with low incomes (79.6%) and experiencing homelessness (74.6%), while a minority supported increasing resources for people who use drugs (33.5%). Politically conservative participants were less likely to support increasing resources for all three populations than those who were politically liberal. Skepticism about the severity of COVID-19 was also associated with less support for increasing resources across groups. DISCUSSION: Our results demonstrate that people who use drugs continue to be stigmatized in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in popular opinion not supporting people who use drugs with potentially lifesaving resources. Overcoming this stigma is essential to prevent COVID-19 among people who use drugs, a population which experiences elevated risk of COVID-19 infection.","Schneider, Kristin E; Wilson, Deborah; Dayton, Lauren; Goodell, Erin M Anderson; Latkin, Carl A",Int J Drug Policy,99,20

Aim: This review focuses on the development of lab-on-chip biosensing platforms for diagnosis of COVID-19 infection. Results: We discuss advantages of utilizing lab-on-chip technologies in response to the current global pandemic, including their potential for low-cost, rapid sample-to-answer processing times, and ease of integration into a range of healthcare settings. We then highlight the development of magnetic, colorimetric, plasmonic, electrical, and lateral flow-based lab-on-chip technologies for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, in addition to other viruses. We focus on rapid, point-of-care technologies that can be deployed at scale, as such devices could be promising alternatives to the current gold standard of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) diagnostic testing.

This is not easy to reproduce with traditional SIR models, which predict a more symmetric epidemic. Here, we argue that superspreaders and population heterogeneity would predict such behaviour even in the absence of restrictions on social life. We present an agent-based lattice model of a disease spreading in a heterogeneous population. We predict that an epidemic driven by superspreaders will spread rapidly in cities, but not in the countryside where the sparse population limits the maximal number of secondary infections. This suggests that mitigation strategies should include restrictions on venues where people meet a large number of strangers. Furthermore, mitigating the epidemic in cities and in the countryside may require different levels of restrictions.","Eilersen, Andreas; Sneppen, Kim",APMIS acta pathol. microbiol. immunol. scand,99,16

We aimed to evaluate the values of routine fecal occult blood (FOB) test and urinary cytology test (UCT) for screening of GI and UI in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: In this retrospective study, COVID-19 patients without associated comorbidities were divided into FOB- or UCT-positive or FOB- or UCT-negative groups. Their clinical characteristics and laboratory findings were then compared. RESULTS: A total of 13.6% of patients (47 of 345) tested positive for FOB, and 57.4% (27 of 47) of these patients lacked gastrointestinal symptoms. A total of 30.1% of patients (104 of 345) exhibited gastrointestinal symptoms, and 38.0% (131 of 345) were positive for either FOB or gastrointestinal symptoms. FOB-positive patients possessed significantly higher levels of C-reactive protein and fewer lymphocytes than FOB-negative patients. A total of 36.9% of patients (80 of 217) exhibited positive UCT, and 97.5% (78 of 80) of these patients possessed normal levels of serum markers for renal injuries. Significant differences in age and sex ratios were observed between the UCT-positive and UCT-negative groups, and 72.4% (42 of 58) of female patients over 60 years old were UCT-positive. CONCLUSIONS: Fecal occult blood test in combination with gastrointestinal symptoms could serve as a simple and useful screening approach for GI diagnoses for COVID-19. Age and sex are risk factors for UI in COVID-19 patients. UCT could be a sensitive tool for assessing early UI at a stage in which serum markers for renal injuries appear normal.","Du, Li; Cao, Xiaoling; Chen, Jing; Wei, Xiuqi; Zeng, Yi; Cheng, Chen; Lin, Yuqi; Tan, Wenbin; Wang, Hui",J Clin Lab Anal,99,20

To further understand how the two proteins act together, we examined their mechanism individually and in concert to promote the annealing between dTAR, the DNA version of the viral transactivation element and its complementary cTAR sequence, taken as model HIV-1 sequences. Gag alone or complexed with RPL7 was found to act as a NA chaperone that destabilizes cTAR stem-loop and promotes its annealing with dTAR through the stem ends via a two-step pathway. In contrast, RPL7 alone acts as a NA annealer that through its NA aggregating properties promotes cTAR/dTAR annealing via two parallel pathways. Remarkably, in contrast to the isolated proteins, their complex promoted efficiently the annealing of cTAR with highly stable dTAR mutants. This was confirmed by the RPL7-promoted boost of the physiologically relevant Gag-chaperoned annealing of (+)PBS RNA to the highly stable tRNALys3 primer, favoring the notion that Gag recruits RPL7 to overcome major roadblocks in viral assembly.","Karnib, Hassan; Nadeem, Muhammad F; Humbert, Nicolas; Sharma, Kamal K; Grytsyk, Natalia; Tisné, Carine; Boutant, Emmanuel; Lequeu, Thiebault; Réal, Eleonore; Boudier, Christian; de Rocquigny, Hugues; Mély, Yves",Nucleic acids res,99,16

Methods: An electronic survey was developed to record the general characteristics of the laboratory, as well as the pre-analytical, analytical, post-analytical and operational practices of biochemistry laboratories that are managing clinical samples of patients with COVID-19. Results: A total of 1210 submissions were included in the analysis. The majority of responses came from hospital central/core laboratories that serve hospital patient groups and handle moderate daily sample volumes. There has been a decrease in the use of pneumatic tube transport, increase in hand delivery and increase in number of layers of plastic bags for samples of patients with clinically suspected or confirmed COVID-19. Surgical face masks and gloves are the most commonly used personal protective equipment (PPE). Just >50% of the laboratories did not perform an additional decontamination step on the instrument after analysis of samples from patients with clinically suspected or confirmed COVID-19. A fifth of laboratories disallowed add-on testing on these samples. Less than a quarter of laboratories autoclaved their samples prior to disposal. Conclusions: The survey responses showed wide variation in pre-analytical, analytical and post-analytical practices in terms of PPE adoption and biosafety processes. It is likely that many of the suboptimal biosafety practices are related to practical local factors, such as limited PPE availability and lack of automated instrumentation.","Loh, Tze Ping; Horvath, Andrea Rita; Wang, Cheng-Bin; Koch, David; Lippi, Giuseppe; Mancini, Nicasio; Ferrari, Maurizio; Hawkins, Robert; Sethi, Sunil; Adeli, Khosrow",Clin Chem Lab Med,99,16

The path for virus invasion into humans and other hosts is mediated by host-pathogen interactions, specifically virus-receptor binding. An in-depth understanding of the virus-receptor binding mechanism is a prerequisite for the discovery of vaccines, antibodies, and small-molecule inhibitors that can interrupt this interaction and prevent or cure infection. In this review, we discuss the viral entry mechanism, the known structural aspects of virus-receptor interactions (SARS-CoV-2 S/humanACE2, SARS-CoV S/humanACE2, and MERS-CoV S/humanDPP4), the key protein domains and amino acid residues involved in binding, and the small-molecule inhibitors and other drugs that have (as of June 2020) exhibited therapeutic potential. Specifically, we review the potential clinical utility of two transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2)-targeting protease inhibitors, nafamostat mesylate and camostat mesylate, as well as two novel potent fusion inhibitors and the repurposed Ebola drug, remdesivir, which is specific to RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, against human coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2.

Up until now only a small amount of data have been published, most often as an overview of the problem. The current study was designed to investigate the co-occurrence of microsomic/macrosomic body structure (micro/macro-SBS) and congenital nervous system disorders or neurological syndromes with symptoms visible from infancy, based on essential data acquired during admission procedures at a neurological rehabilitation ward for children and adolescents. The study applied a retrospective analysis of data collected during hospitalization of 327 children and adolescents, aged 4-18 years who had been affected since infancy by congenital disorders of the nervous system and/or neurological syndromes associated with a minimum of one neurodysfunction. To identify subjects with microsomic or macrosomic body structure in the group of children and adolescents, the adopted criteria took into account z-score values for body height (z-score Ht), body weight (z-score Wt), head circumference (z-score HC), BMI (z-score BMI) and head circumference index (z-score HCI). The rates of micro/macro-SBS in the study group amounted to 7.3% and 0.6%, respectively. The findings show a more frequent co-occurrence of, as well as statistically significant correlations between, micro/macro-SBS and type of spasticity (cerebral palsy) (p = 0.024) as well as hydrocephalus not treated surgically (p < 0.001).

CCAT1 was detected by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) in NSCLC cells (A549, H1299, SK-MES1, H460, and H647) and human bronchial epithelial cells (16HBE). H460 and A549 cells were then selected for the determination of CCAT1 expression after exposure to radiation (0, 2, 4, 6 Gy) at different time points (0, 6, 12, 24 h). Colony forming assay was performed to evaluate the effects of CCAT1 siRNA or pcDNA3.1-CCAT1 vector on the radiosensitivity of H460 and A549 cells. Then, flow cytometry, western blotting and qRT-PCR were also conducted. CCAT1 was increased in NSCLC cells when compared with 16HBE cells, which was declined in a time- and dosage-dependent manner after exposure to radiation. The H460 and A549 cell colonies were decreased and the Î³-H2AX expression was elevated with the increase of radiation dosage, which was more obvious in those transfected with CCAT1 siRNA. CCAT1 downregulation arrested NSCLC cells at G2/M phase. Moreover, the enhanced apoptosis of radiotherapy-treated NSCLC cells with reductions of p-p38/p38, p-ERK/ERK, and p-JNK/JNK was promoted by siCCAT1, but it was reversed by pcDNA3.1-CCAT1 vector. Inhibiting CCAT1 regulated cell cycle, DNA damage and apoptosis of NSCLC cells, and affected MAPK pathway, eventually improving the radiosensitivity of NSCLC.","Wang, Zhao",Kaohsiung j. med. sci.

An additional search for grey literature was performed including pre-prints and reports in Google Advanced, LitCovid and MedRx. Two independent reviewers assessed the articles retrieved from the databases (n=131) based on pre-established inclusion criteria and included six articles. Analysis of the results revealed six different types of DHT, including 5 dedicated to telemedicine and one used to track activity of people who were confined to their homes. The results showed positive health-related outcomes and user behavior outcomes. This review revealed that there is limited literature on the use of DHT to enable remote care in response to a pandemic and therefore calls for more documentation of the ongoing deployment of DHTs to support patient safety and the delivery of quality care during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.","Choukou, M.

We found that anti-vaccine views have been dominant on the platform in terms of the number of groups and the volume of content they generated. Analyses of online information sources that enabled the production of vaccine narratives revealed that vaccine content using low credibility sources was less than 2%, and anti-vaccine groups have increasingly more utilized other relatively credible sources, such as government sources and legitimate news media. It was also found that nearly 20% of sources used by anti-vaccine groups each month were not shared by any pro-vaccine groups, and sources that were more widely used among anti-vaccine groups tended to represent more conservative and far-right political beliefs.

Small animal models that recapitulate SARS-CoV-2 disease are needed urgently for rapid evaluation of medical countermeasures2,3. SARS-CoV-2 cannot infect wild-type laboratory mice owing to inefficient interactions between the viral spike protein and the mouse orthologue of the human receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)4. Here we used reverse genetics5 to remodel the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and mouse ACE2 and designed mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2 MA), a recombinant virus that can use mouse ACE2 for entry into cells. SARS-CoV-2 MA was able to replicate in the upper and lower airways of both young adult and aged BALB/c mice. SARS-CoV-2 MA caused more severe disease in aged mice, and exhibited more clinically relevant phenotypes than those seen in Hfh4-ACE2 transgenic mice, which express human ACE2 under the control of the Hfh4 (also known as Foxj1) promoter. We demonstrate the utility of this model using vaccine-challenge studies in immune-competent mice with native expression of mouse ACE2. Finally, we show that the clinical candidate interferon-&#955;1a (IFN-&#955;1a) potently inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication in primary human airway epithelial cells in vitro-both prophylactic and therapeutic administration of IFN-&#955;1a diminished SARS-CoV-2 replication in mice.

The symptoms of over ischemia/heart failure may be challenging to distinguish as dyspnoea and chest discomfort overlap with those due to COVID-19. Therefore, beside close monitoring with ECG, biomarkes and, in case of demonstrated cardiac involvement, echocardiography, strategies to improve myocardial oxygen delivery should be promptly applied. The cytokine release with complement and iNO dysregulation are established mechanisms potentially leading to sepsis-related cardiomyopathy, making sepsis per se one of the potential mechanism leading to acute cardiac injury in COVID-19 patients. Moreover, the hyper-inflammation with endothelial dysfunction is likely be responsible of both pulmonary in-situ platelet aggregation and deep thrombosis potentially leading to severe pulmonary embolism and right ventricular failure. Besides the customary antithrombotic prophylaxis for critical patients, D-dimer levels and tighter coagulation monitoring are recommended and should guide the choice for anticoagulation treatment.

To enhance the therapeutic potential of curcumin against heart failure, we produced a series of synthetic curcumin analogues and investigated their inhibitory activity against p300-HAT. The compound with the strongest activity was further evaluated to determine its effects on cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and pressure overload-induced heart failure in mice. We synthesised five synthetic curcumin analogues and found that a compound we have named GO-Y030 most strongly inhibited p300-HAT activity. Furthermore, 1 µM GO-Y030, in a manner equivalent to 10 µM curcumin, suppressed phenylephrine-induced hypertrophic responses in cultured cardiomyocytes. In mice undergoing transverse aortic constriction surgery, administration of GO-Y030 at a mere 1% of an equivalently-effective dose of curcumin significantly attenuated cardiac hypertrophy and systolic dysfunction. In addition, this low dose of GO-Y030 almost completely blocked histone H3K9 acetylation and eliminated left ventricular fibrosis.

We described time trends in social contacts for the pre-pandemic and pandemic periods in Quebec, Canada. MethodsCONNECT is a population-based study of social contacts conducted shortly before (2018/2019) and during the Covid-19 pandemic (April 2020 - February 2021), using the same methodology for both periods. We recruited participants by random-digit-dialing and collected data by self-administered web-based questionnaires. Questionnaires documented socio-demographic characteristics and social contacts for two assigned days. A contact was defined as a two-way conversation at a distance [≤]2 meters or as a physical contact, irrespective of masking. We used weighted generalized linear models with a Poisson distribution and robust variance (taking possible overdispersion into account) to compare the mean number of social contacts over time by characteristics. ResultsA total of 1291 and 5516 Quebecers completed the study before and during the pandemic, respectively. Contacts significantly decreased from a mean of 8 contacts/day prior to the pandemic to 3 contacts/day during the spring 2020 lockdown. Contacts remained lower than the pre-Covid period thereafter (lowest=3 contacts/day during the Christmas 2020/2021 holidays, highest=5 in September 2020). Contacts at work, during leisure activities/other locations, and at home with visitors showed the greatest decreases since the beginning of the pandemic.

Gender differences in cannabinoid-related disorders are highlighted by different research fields (preclinical, clinical, socio-demographic studies), but few studies focused on differential symptom expression in cannabinoid-induced psychosis. This study aims at investigating qualitative and quantitative gender differences in specific psychopathological domains in a clinical sample of subjects affected by cannabinoid-induced psychotic disorder, without psychiatric comorbidity. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The study was carried out at the Psychiatric Inpatient Service of General Hospital of Perugia (Italy). In this cross-sectional gender study, 28 inpatients were enrolled, 14 males (M) and 14 females (F). Participants were administered a psychometric battery consisting of 7 tests (PANSS, NDS-I, YMRS, HAM-D, HAM-A, AQ, SSI) in order to investigate 7 psychopathological domains (Psychosis, Dysphoria, Mania, Depression, Anxiety, Aggressive Behaviour and Suicide Ideation). Scores obtained at each test were compared between male and females by using Mann-Whitney U test (p<0.05). RESULTS: In this study, we observed that males present higher severity of psychotic symptoms, with prominent scores in PANSS positive and general psychopathology scale (p<0.001), and an important expression of aggressive behavior (p<0.001) compared with females. Female sample, instead, shows a greater expression of dysphoria and depressive domains (p<0.001) and a lower, but statistically significant, prevalence in the anxiety domains expression (p=0.01). By these observations, we could assert that in male group thought disorders are prominent. On the other hand, in female group affective disorder are prominent. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed how gender influences the phenomenic expression of psychiatric disorders. In line with the precision medicine paradigm, a further clarification of different clinical profiles based on gender would allow the choice of a personalized treatment plan with better efficacy and accuracy indices.","Bachetti, Massimo C; Lanzi, Roberta; Menculini, Giulia; Scopetta, Francesca; Tortorella, Alfonso; Moretti, Patrizia",Psychiatr Danub,99,5

Once available, vaccine is gradually produced, evoking the question on how to distribute it best. While official vaccination guidelines largely focus on the question to whom vaccines should be provided first (e.g. to risk groups), here we propose a generic strategy for their distribution in time and space, which sequentially prioritizes regions with a high local infection growth rate. To demonstrate this strategy, we develop an agent-based model describing the time-evolution of infection patterns and their response to vaccination. For heterogeneous infection patterns, the proposed strategy at least halves the number of deaths in our simulations compared to the standard practice of distributing vaccines proportionally to the population density. This applies for a wide range of reproduction numbers and vaccine production rates and might stimulate discussions on the importance of the spatiotemporal distribution of vaccines for official guidelines.","Grauer, Jens; Lowen, Hartmut; Liebchen, Benno",,99,20

In this work, we analyze the dispersion of cough-generated droplets in the wake of a walking person for different space sizes. The air flow is simulated by solving the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes equations, and the droplets are modelled as passive Lagrangian particles. Simulation results show that the cloud of droplets locates around and below the waist height of the manikin after two seconds from coughing, which indicates that kids walking behind an infectious patient are exposed to higher transmission risk than adults. More importantly, two distinct droplet dispersion modes occupying significantly different contamination regions are discovered. A slight change of space size is found being able to trigger the transition of dispersion modes even though the flow patterns are still similar. This shows the importance of accurately simulating the air flow in predicting the dispersion of viral droplets and implies the necessity to set different safe-distancing guidelines for different environments.","Li, Zhaobin; Wang, Hongping; Zhang, Xinlei; Wu, Ting; Yang, Xiaolei",,99,12

The pulmonary function and symptoms of these seven patients were significantly improved in 2 days after MSC transplantation. Among them, two common and one severe patient were recovered and discharged in 10 days after treatment. After treatment, the peripheral lymphocytes were increased, the C-reactive protein decreased, and the overactivated cytokine-secreting immune cells CXCR3+CD4+ T cells, CXCR3+CD8+ T cells, and CXCR3+ NK cells disappeared in 3-6 days. In addition, a group of CD14+CD11c+CD11bmid regulatory DC cell population dramatically increased. Meanwhile, the level of TNF-&#945; was significantly decreased, while IL-10 increased in MSC treatment group compared to the placebo control group. Furthermore, the gene expression profile showed MSCs were ACE2- and TMPRSS2- which indicated MSCs are free from COVID-19 infection. Thus, the intravenous transplantation of MSCs was safe and effective for treatment in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, especially for the patients in critically severe condition.","Leng, Zikuan; Zhu, Rongjia; Hou, Wei; Feng, Yingmei; Yang, Yanlei; Han, Qin; Shan, Guangliang; Meng, Fanyan; Du, Dongshu; Wang, Shihua; Fan, Junfen; Wang, Wenjing; Deng, Luchan; Shi, Hongbo; Li, Hongjun; Hu, Zhongjie; Zhang, Fengchun; Gao, Jinming; Liu, Hongjian; Li, Xiaoxia; Zhao, Yangyang; Yin, Kan; He, Xijing; Gao, Zhengchao; Wang, Yibin; Yang, Bo; Jin, Ronghua; Stambler, Ilia; Lim, Lee Wei; Su, Huanxing; Moskalev, Alexey; Cano, Antonio; Chakrabarti, Sasanka; Min, Kyung-Jin; Ellison-Hughes, Georgina; Caruso, Calogero; Jin, Kunlin; Zhao, Robert Chunhua",Aging Dis,99,1

TAb and SNAb levels were compared with avidity in previously infected individuals at 1.3 and 6.2 months post-infection in paired samples from 80 COVID-19 patients. Sera from SARS-CoV-2 vaccinated individuals were also evaluated for antibody avidity. RESULTS: The newly designed avidity assay in this TOP panel correlated well with a reference Bio-Layer Interferometry avidity assay (r=0.88). The imprecision of the TOP avidity assay was less than 10%. Although TAb and neutralization activity (by SNAb) decreased between 1.3 and 6.2 months post-infection, the antibody avidity increased significantly (P < 0.0001). Antibody avidity in 10 SARS-CoV-2 vaccinated individuals (median 28 days post-vaccination) was comparable to the measured antibody avidity in infected individuals (median 26 days post-infection). CONCLUSION: This highly precise and versatile TOP-Plus panel with the ability to measure SARS-CoV-2 TAb, SNAb, IgG and IgM antibody levels and avidity of individual sera on one sensor can become a valuable asset in monitoring not only SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, but also the status of individuals' COVID-19 vaccination response.","Racine-Brzostek, Sabrina E; Karbaschi, Mohsen; Gaebler, Christian; Klasse, P J; Yee, Jim; Caskey, Marina; Yang, He S; Hao, Ying; Sukhu, Ashley; Rand, Sophie; Chadburn, Amy; Shi, Yuanyuan; Zuk, Robert; Nussenzweig, Michel C; Cushing, Melissa M; Zhao, Zhen",Clin. chem,99,20

The Management of the Istituto Nazionale Tumori - IRCCS ""Fondazione Pascale"" in Naples (INT-Pascale), along with all Health professionals decided not to interrupt the treatment of those hospitalized and to continue, even if after a careful triage in order not to allow SARS-CoV-2 positive subjects to access, to take care of cancer patients with serious conditions. Although very few (n = 3) patients developed a symptomatic COVID-19 and required the transfer to a COVID-19 area of the Institute, no patients died during the hospitalization and completed their oncology treatment. Besides monitoring of the patients, all employees of the Institute (physicians, nurses, researchers, lawyers, accountants, gatekeepers, guardians, janitors) have been tested for a possible exposure. Personnel identified as positive, has been promptly subjected to home quarantine and subdued to health surveillance. One severe case of respiratory distress has been reported in a positive employees and one death of a family member. Further steps to home monitoring of COVID-19 clinical course have been taken with the development of remote Wi-Fi connected digital devices for the detection of early signs of respiratory distress, including heart rate and oxygen saturation.In conclusion cancer care has been performed and continued safely also during COVID-19 pandemic and further remote home strategies are in progress to ensure the appropriate monitoring of cancer patients.","Buonaguro, Franco M; Botti, Gerardo; Ascierto, Paolo Antonio; Pignata, Sandro; Ionna, Franco; Delrio, Paolo; Petrillo, Antonella; Cavalcanti, Ernesta; Di Bonito, Maurizio; Perdonà, Sisto; De Laurentiis, Michelino; Fiore, Francesco; Palaia, Raffaele; Izzo, Francesco; D039,; Auria, Stefania; Rossi, Virginia; Menegozzo, Simona; Piccirillo, Mauro; Celentano, Egidio; Cuomo, Arturo; Normanno, Nicola; Tornesello, Maria Lina; Saviano, Rocco; Barberio, Daniela; Buonaguro, Luigi; Giannoni, Giovanni; Muto, Paolo; Miscio, Leonardo; Bianchi, Attilio A M",Infect Agent Cancer,99,25

We were familiarizing ourselves with digital pathology solutions at the time when the COVID-19 outbreak forced us to embark on an abrupt transition to digital pathology. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to quantitatively describe how the abrupt transition to digital pathology might affect the quality of diagnoses, model possible causes by probabilistic modeling, and qualitatively gauge the perception of this abrupt transition. METHODS: A total of 17 pathologists and residents participated in this study; these participants reviewed 25 additional test cases from the archives and completed a final psychologic survey. For each case, participants performed several different diagnostic tasks, and their results were recorded and compared with the original diagnoses performed using the gold standard method (ie, conventional microscopy). We performed Bayesian data analysis with probabilistic modeling. RESULTS: The overall analysis, comprising 1345 different items, resulted in a 9% (117/1345) error rate in using digital slides. The task of differentiating a neoplastic process from a nonneoplastic one accounted for an error rate of 10.7% (42/392), whereas the distinction of a malignant process from a benign one accounted for an error rate of 4.2% (11/258). Apart from residents, senior pathologists generated most discrepancies (7.9%, 13/164). Our model showed that these differences among career levels persisted even after adjusting for other factors. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings are in line with previous findings, emphasizing that the duration of transition (ie, lengthy or abrupt) might not influence the diagnostic performance. Moreover, our findings highlight that senior pathologists may be limited by a digital gap, which may negatively affect their performance with digital pathology. These results can guide the process of digital transition in the field of pathology.","Giaretto, Simone; Renne, Salvatore Lorenzo; Rahal, Daoud; Bossi, Paola; Colombo, Piergiuseppe; Spaggiari, Paola; Manara, Sofia; Sollai, Mauro; Fiamengo, Barbara; Brambilla, Tatiana; Fernandes, Bethania; Rao, Stefania; Elamin, Abubaker; Valeri, Marina; De Carlo, Camilla; Belsito, Vincenzo; Lancellotti, Cesare; Cieri, Miriam; Cagini, Angelo; Terracciano, Luigi; Roncalli, Massimo; Di Tommaso, Luca",J Med Internet Res,99,25

To explore the impact of intervention measures on the COVID-19 epidemic, we established susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) models to predict the epidemic characteristics of COVID-19 at four different phases (beginning, outbreak, recession, and plateau) from January 1st to March 30th, 2020. We found that the infection rate rapidly grew up to 0.3647 at Phase II from 0.1100 at Phase I and went down to 0.0600 and 0.0006 at Phase III and IV, respectively. The reproduction numbers of COVID-19 were 10.7843, 13.8144, 1.4815, and 0.0137 at Phase I, II, III, and IV, respectively. These results suggest that intensive interventions, including compulsory home isolation and rapid improvement of medical resources, can effectively reduce the COVID-19 transmission. Furthermore, the predicted COVID-19 epidemic trend by our models was close to the actual epidemic trend in Wuhan. Our phase-based SEIR models demonstrate that intensive intervention measures can effectively control COVID-19 spread even without specific medicines and vaccines against this disease.","Li, Mengyuan; Guo, Xiaonan; Wang, Xiaosheng",J Med Virol,99,1

This disease, named as COVID-19, is similar to patients infected by SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and nearly 20% of patients developed severe condition. Cardiac injury is a prevalent complication of severe patients, exacerbating the disease severity in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the key host cellular receptor of SARS-CoV-2, has been identified in multiple organs, but its cellular distribution in human heart is not illuminated clearly. This study performed the first state-of-art single cell atlas of adult human heart, and revealed that pericytes with high expression of ACE2 might act as the target cardiac cell of SARS-CoV-2. The pericytes injury due to virus infection may result in capillary endothelial cells dysfunction, inducing microvascular dysfunction. And patients with basic heart failure disease showed increased ACE2 expression at both mRNA and protein levels, meaning that if infected by the virus these patients may have higher risk of heart attack and critically ill condition. The finding of this study explains the high rate of severe cases among COVID-19 patients with basic cardiovascular disease; and these results also perhaps provide important reference to clinical treatment of cardiac injury among severe patients infected by SARS-CoV-2.","Chen, Liang; Li, Xiangjie; Chen, Mingquan; Feng, Yi; Xiong, Chenglong",Cardiovasc Res,99,3

The decision to administer antibiotics early in the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection depends on the likelihood of bacterial coinfection. METHODS: We performed a retrospective chart review of all patients admitted through the emergency department with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection over a 6-week period in a large healthcare system in the United States. Blood and respiratory culture results were abstracted and adjudicated by multiple authors. The primary outcome was the rate of bacteremia. We secondarily looked to define clinical or laboratory features associated with bacteremia. RESULTS: There were 542 patients admitted with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, with an average age of 62.8 years. Of these, 395 had blood cultures performed upon admission, with six true positive results (1.1% of the total population). An additional 14 patients had positive respiratory cultures treated as true pathogens in the first 72 h. Low blood pressure and elevated white blood cell count, neutrophil count, blood urea nitrogen, and lactate were statistically significantly associated with bacteremia. Clinical outcomes were not statistically significantly different between patients with and without bacteremia. CONCLUSIONS: We found a low rate of bacteremia in patients admitted with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Although anticoagulants such as unfractionated Heparin and Enoxaparin are both being used for therapeutic mitigation of COVID associated coagulopathy (CAC), differences in their clinical outcomes remain to be investigated. Methods: We analyzed records of 1,113 patients in the Mayo Clinic Electronic Health Record (EHR) database who were admitted to the hospital for COVID-19 between April 4, 2020 and August 31, 2020, including 19 different Mayo Clinic sites in Arizona, Florida, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. Among this patient population, we compared cohorts of patients who received different types of anticoagulants, including 441 patients who received unfractionated Heparin and 166 patients who received Enoxaparin. Clinical outcomes at 28 days were compared, and propensity score matching was used to control for potential confounding variables including: demographics, comorbidities, ICU status, chronic kidney disease stage, and oxygenation status. Patients with a history of acute kidney injury and patients who received multiple types of anticoagulants were excluded from the study. Findings: We find that COVID-19 patients administered unfractionated Heparin but not Enoxaparin have higher rates of 28-day mortality (risk ratio: 4.3; 95% Confidence Interval [C.I.].: [1.8, 10.2]; p-value: 8.5e-4, Benjamini Hochberg [BH] adjusted p-value: 2.1e-3), after controlling for potential confounding factors.

It is crucial to have a rapid and sensitive method to detect the bacterium Clostridium botulinum in food. In this study, a rapid detection assay of C. botulinum in food using loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) technology was developed. The optimal primers were identified among three sets of primers designed specifically based on the partial ntnh gene encoding nontoxic-nonhaemagglutinin (NTNH) for rapid detection of the target DNA in plasmids. The optimal temperature and reaction time of the LAMP assay were determined to be 64 °C and 60 min, respectively. The chemical kit could be assembled based on these optimized reaction conditions for quick, initial high-throughput screening of C. botulinum in food samples. The established LAMP assay showed high specificity and sensitivity in detecting the target DNA with a limit of 0.0001 pg/ul (i.e., ten times more sensitive than that of the PCR method) and an accuracy rate of 100%. This study demonstrated a potentially rapid, cost-effective, and easy-operating method to detect C. botulinum in food and clinical samples based on LAMP technology.","Chen, Yufei; Li, Hao; Yang, Liu; Wang, Lei; Sun, Ruyi; Shearer, Julia E S; Sun, Fengjie",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),99,1

COVID-19 creates a unique “income shock” that is expected to increase the prevalence of household food insecurity. This food insecurity can be measured by utilizing the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS). More fundamentally, COVID-19 heightens household concern about the capacity of the Canadian food system to ensure food availability. Despite surges in demand and supply chain disruptions, we currently do not observe broad, rapid appreciation in food prices. This suggests that there is an adequate supply of food for the near term. There is less certainty over intermediate and longer time periods because so many factors are in flux, particularly the rate of increases in sicknesses and deaths across the country and globally. Data on these health factors and elements of the food supply chain are needed to predict beyond a short time frame.

452008,452008,452008,Personal View: Low-Dose Lung Radiotherapy Should be Evaluated as a Treatment for Severe COVID-19 Lung Disease,15.475638,8.321463,2020,"The use of high-Adsorption membrane hemofiltration in COVID-19 positive patients to reduce the severity of a cytokine storm is clearly beneficial but at the same time, there are no certain procedures for its practical use. The objective: To study the change in the levels of IL-6 and IL-18 in response to prolonged (24-72 hours) high-Adsorption membrane hemofiltration. Subjects and methods. We retrospectively analyzed the data on IL-6 and IL-18 levels and their changes in 69 patients who were COVID-19 positive and had different degrees of lung damage, they had received high-Adsorption membrane hemofiltration during their stay at the intensive care unit. The extent of lung lesions was the following: 4 people had CT-2, 44 people had CT-3, and 21 patients had CT-4. 18 patients had an unfavorable outcome of the disease. High-Adsorption membrane hemofiltration (Prismaflex) was used in the group of patients who had clinical signs of the rapid progression of the disease and also such laboratory findings as elevated values of C-reactive protein (above 100 mg/L), ferritin (more than 600 uu/L), and progression of lymphopenia. This intervention lasted for 24 hours at CT-2/3, and 48 hours at CT-4. The effluent dose was 30.0 6.4 ml/kg/h. The levels of IL-6, IL-18, and procalcitonin were tested before and after the completion of the intervention, and the difference between their concentration before and after high-Adsorption membrane hemofiltration was calculated. The potential association between received data (IL-6, IL-18, delta of IL-6, delta of IL-18) and degree of lung damage and outcomes was analyzed. Results. It was detected that the more the lungs were affected, the lower levels of IL-6 and IL-18 were and vice versa and this correlation was not associated with the use of tocilizumab (used in 44 people). The maximum decrease in the level of cytokines was observed in the group of patients with CT-2. There was a significant association between the delta of IL-6 (F = 6.69;p 0.05) and the outcome which was especially pronounced in people with a favorable outcome. Conclusion. As the inflammation progresses in the lungs, the levels of IL-6 and IL-18 decrease which may be a manifestation of the depletion of the cytokine storm. The use of prolonged high-Adsorption membrane hemofiltration (24-48 h) allows reducing the level of cytokines. The delta value reflects a decrease in IL-6 concentration, it significantly correlates with the outcome which indicates the importance of using this method in a continuous mode. © 2020 Geocarrefour.

Little is known about the experiences of critical care physicians caring for the sickest coronavirus disease 2019 patients. Our goal is to understand how high stress levels and shortages faced by these physicians during Spring 2020 have evolved. DESIGN: We surveyed (October 23, 2020 to November 16, 2020) U.S. critical care physicians treating coronavirus disease 2019 patients who participated in a National survey earlier in the pandemic (April 23, 2020 to May 3, 2020) regarding their stress and shortages they faced. SETTING: ICU. PATIENTS: Coronavirus disease 2019 patients. INTERVENTION: Irrelevant. MEASUREMENT: Physician emotional distress/physical exhaustion: low (not at all/not much), moderate, or high (a lot/extreme). Shortage indicators: insufficient ICU-trained staff and shortages in medication, equipment, or personal protective equipment requiring protocol changes. MAIN RESULTS: Of 2,375 U.S. critical care attending physicians who responded to the initial survey, we received responses from 1,356 (57.1% response rate), 97% of whom (1,278) recently treated coronavirus disease 2019 patients. Two thirds of physicians (67.6% [864]) reported moderate or high levels of emotional distress in the Spring versus 50.7% (763) in the Fall. Reports of staffing shortages persisted with 46.5% of Fall respondents (594) reporting a staff shortage versus 48.3% (617) in the Spring. Meaningful shortages of medication and equipment reported in the Spring were largely alleviated. Although personal protective equipment shortages declined by half, they remained substantial. CONCLUSIONS: Stress, staffing, and, to a lesser degree, personal protective equipment shortages faced by U.S. critical care physicians remain high. Stress levels were higher among women. Considering the persistence of these findings, rising levels of infection nationally raise concerns about the capacity of the U.S. critical care system to meet ongoing and future demands.","Gray, Bradley M; Vandergrift, Jonathan L; Barnhart, Brendan J; Reddy, Siddharta G; Chesluk, Benjamin J; Stevens, Jennifer S; Lipner, Rebecca S; Lynn, Lorna A; Barnett, Michael L; Landon, Bruce E",Crit. care med,99,16

However, limits and issues of noncontact temperature measurement devices are not well known and technical-scientific literature itself sometimes provides conflicting reference values on the body and skin temperature of healthy subjects. To limit the risk of contagion, national authorities have set the obligation to measure body temperature of workers at the entrance to the workplace. In this paper, the authors analyze noncontact body temperature measurement issues from both clinical and metrological points of view with the aim to (i) improve body temperature measurements accuracy; (ii) estimate the uncertainty of body temperature measurement on the field; (iii) propose a screening decision rule for the prevention of the spread of COVID-19. The approach adopted in this paper takes into account both the traditional instrumental uncertainty sources and clinical-medical ones related to the subjectivity of the measurand. A proper screening protocol for body temperature measurement considering the role of uncertainty is essential to correctly choose the threshold temperature value and measurement method to access critical places during COVID-19 pandemic emergency.","Dell039,; Isola, Giovanni Battista; Cosentini, Elena; Canale, Laura; Ficco, Giorgio; Isola, Marco",Sensors (Basel),99,29

The etiological diagnosis presupposes the isolation of virus genetic material in the patient's biological sample but laboratory diagnostics also make use of searching possibility for immunoglobulin (Ig)G, IgM classes antibodies. The characteristics of the antibody response are not yet completely clear. Methods This study describes a serological monitoring of subjects, elderly nursing care residence guests, interested by a very large infection outbreak. After first nasopharyngeal swab, all the positive subjects (43) were monitored for the persistence of the virus infection through nasopharyngeal swab after 20 days (16-24), 32 days (28-36) and after 49 days (47-50). At the same time, during the second (day 32) and third (day 49) follow up, all the guests were investigated for IgM and IgG anti SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, by using a quantitative chemiluminescence method. Results Thirty two days after performing the first diagnostic swab, 39 of 43 patients (90%) had IgG higher than the cut off value. After 49 days the four patients with negative IgG were still negative. The comparison of the levels of IgG-Ab between the controls shows a significant decrease in concentrations (-10%). Conclusions Our study confirms that in most patients affected by COVID-19 there is a typical antibody response with IgG-Ab present in 90% of nursing care COVID-19 positive residence guests. For IgM-Ab only 23% of tested subjects were positive on the 32nd and 49th day of illness, always in parallel with the IgG-Ab positivity.","Carta, Mariarosa; Bragagnolo, Luciana; Tramarin, Andrea; Barzon, Elena; Cappelletti, Anna; Pascarella, Michela; Forner, Lauretta; Meneghini, Maria Grazia; Tripodi, Chiara; Rassu, Mario; Giavarina, Davide",Diagnosis (Berl),99,24

The term ""pandemic"" is defined as ""an epidemic occurring worldwide, or over a very wide area, crossing international boundaries and usually affecting a large number of people"". The global response to the COVID-19 pandemic has not been seen since the outbreak of Human Immunodeficiency Virus in the early eighties. But there is another unseen pandemic running alongside the current COVID-19 pandemic, which affects a vast number of people, crossing international boundaries and occurring in every single country worldwide. The pandemic of traumatic injuries. Traumatic injuries account for 11% of the current Global Burden of Disease, resulting in nearly 5 million deaths annually and is the third-leading cause of death worldwide. For every trauma-related death, it is estimated that up to 50 people sustain permanent or temporary disabilities. Furthermore, traumatic injuries occur at disproportionately higher rates in low- and middle-income countries, with approximately 90% of injuries and more than 90% of global deaths from injury occurring these countries. Injuries are increasing worldwide, crossing international boundaries and affecting a large number of people, in the same manner Human Immunodeficiency Virus did in the 1980's and COVID-19 is today. The tremendous global effort to tackle the COVID-19 and Human Immunodeficiency Virus pandemics has occurred whilst ignoring the comparable pandemic of injury.

Patients with cancer have been reported to experience a more severe COVID-19 syndrome; moreover, there are concerns of a potential interference between immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 6 and 16 May 2020, a 22-item survey was sent to Italian physicians involved in administering ICIs. It aimed at exploring the perception about SARS-CoV-2-related risks in cancer patients receiving ICIs, and the attitudes towards their management. RESULTS: The 104 respondents had a median age of 35.5 years, 58.7% were females and 71.2% worked in Northern Italy. 47.1% of respondents argued a synergism between ICIs and SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis leading to worse outcomes, but 97.1% would not deny an ICI only for the risk of infection. During COVID-19 outbreak, to reduce hospital visits, 55.8% and 30.8% opted for the highest labelled dose of each ICI and/or, among different ICIs for the same indication, for the one with the longer interval between cycles, respectively. 53.8% of respondents suggested testing for SARS-CoV-2 every cancer patient candidate to ICIs. 71.2% declared to manage patients with onset of dyspnoea and cough as infected by SARS-CoV-2 until otherwise proven; however, 96.2% did not reduce the use of steroids to manage immune-related toxicities. The administration of ICIs in specific situations for different cancer types has not been drastically conditioned. CONCLUSIONS: These results highlight the uncertainties around the perception of a potential interference between ICIs and COVID-19, supporting the need of focused studies on this topic.","Tagliamento, Marco; Spagnolo, Francesco; Poggio, Francesca; Soldato, Davide; Conte, Benedetta; Ruelle, Tommaso; Barisione, Emanuela; De Maria, Andrea; Del Mastro, Lucia; Di Maio, Massimo; Lambertini, Matteo",Eur J Clin Invest,99,1

To contain the spread of its contagious effect, India imposed a stringent lockdown, and then the stringency was relaxed to some extent in its succeeding phases. We measure social benefits of the lockdown in terms of improved air quality in Indian cities by quantifying the effects with city-specific slope coefficients. We find that the containment measures have resulted in improvement in air quality, but it is not uniform across cities and across pollutants. The level of PM2.5 decreases from about 6 to 25% in many cities. Moreover, we observe that partial relaxations do not help in resuming economic and social activities. It should also be noted that counter-virus measures could not bring levels of the emissions to WHO standards; it highlights the importance of role of green production and consumption activities.","Kumar, Surender; Managi, Shunsuke",Econ Disaster Clim Chang,99,16

In this study, we introduce the on-line multiloci identification system (MIST) for automated detection of three hundred and forty-nine Trichoderma species based on a set of three DNA barcodes. MIST is based on the reference databases of validated sequences of three commonly used phylogenetic markers collected from public databases. The databases consist of four hundred and sixteen complete sequences of the nuclear rRNA internal transcribed spacers 1 and 2 (ITS), five hundred and eighty-three sequence fragments of the gene encoding translation elongation factor 1-alpha (tef1) and five hundred and thirty-four sequence fragments of the gene encoding RNA polymerase subunit 2 (rpb2). Through MIST, information from different DNA barcodes can be combined and the identification of Trichoderma species can be achieved based on the integrated parametric sequence similarity search (blastn) performed in the manner of a decision tree classifier. In the verification process, MIST provided correct identification for forty-four Trichoderma spp. based on DNA barcodes consisting from tef1 and rpb2 markers. Thus, MIST can be used to obtain an automated species identification as well as to retrieve sequences required for the manual identification by means of phylogenetic analysis.IMPORTANCE The genus Trichoderma is important to human kind, with a wide range of applications in industry, agriculture and bioremediation. Thus, quick and accurate identification of Trichoderma species is paramount since it is usually the first step in Trichoderma-based research. However, it frequently becomes a limitation, especially for researchers who lack taxonomic knowledge of fungi. Moreover, as the number of Trichoderma-based studies has increased, a growing number of unidentified sequences have been stored in public databases, which has made the species identification more ambiguous. In this study, we provide an easy to use tool for automated species identification (MIST), a list of Trichoderma species, and corresponding sequences of reference DNA barcodes. Therefore, this study will facilitate the research on the biodiversity and applications of the genus Trichoderma.","Dou, Kai; Lu, Zhixiang; Wu, Qiong; Ni, Mi; Yu, Chuanjin; Wang, Meng; Li, Yaqian; Wang, Xinhua; Xie, Huilan; Chen, Jie; Zhang, Chulong",,99,26

METHODS: We evaluated the impact of COVID-19 pandemic in 78 US hospitals on central line associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI) and catheter associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI) events 12 months pre-COVID-19 and 6 months during COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: There were 795,022 central line-days and 817,267 urinary catheter-days over the two study periods. Compared to pre-COVID-19 period, CLABSI rates increased during the pandemic period from 0.56 to 0.85 (51.0%) per 1,000 line-days (p<0.001) and from 1.00 to 1.64 (62.9%) per 10,000 patient-days (p<0.001). Hospitals with monthly COVID-19 patients representing >10% of admissions had a NHSN device standardized infection ratio for CLABSI that was 2.38 times higher compared to those with <5% prevalence during the pandemic period (p=0.004). Coagulase-negative staphylococcus CLABSI increased by 130% from 0.07 to 0.17 events per 1,000 line-days (p<0.001), and Candida sp. by 56.9% from 0.14 to 0.21 per 1,000 line-days (p=0.01). In contrast, no significant changes were identified for CAUTI (0.86 vs. 0.77 per 1,000 catheter-days; p=0.19). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with substantial increases in CLABSI but not CAUTI events. Our findings underscore the importance of hardwiring processes for optimal line care, and regular feedback on performance to maintain a safe environment.","Fakih, Mohamad G; Bufalino, Angelo; Sturm, Lisa; Huang, Ren-Huai; Ottenbacher, Allison; Saake, Karl; Winegar, Angela; Fogel, Richard; Cacchione, Joseph",Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,99,20

In this study, we detected T-cells reactive to SARS-CoV-2 proteins M, S, and N, as well as serum virus-specific IgM, IgA, IgG, in nearly all SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals, but not in healthy donors. Virus-reactive T cells exhibited signs of in vivo activation, as suggested by the surface expression of immune-checkpoint molecules PD1 and TIGIT. Of note, we detected antigen-specific adaptive immune response both in asymptomatic and symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects. More importantly, symptomatic patients displayed a significantly higher magnitude of both cell-mediated and humoral adaptive immune response to the virus, as compared to asymptomatic individuals. These findings suggest that an uncontrolled adaptive immune response contribute to the development of the life-threatening inflammatory phase of the disease. Finally, this study might open the way to develop effective vaccination strategies.","Mazzoni, Alessio; Maggi, Laura; Capone, Manuela; Spinicci, Michele; Salvati, Lorenzo; Colao, Maria Grazia; Vanni, Anna; Kiros, Seble Tekle; Mencarini, Jessica; Zammarchi, Lorenzo; Mantengoli, Elisabetta; Menicacci, Lorenzo; Caldini, Eleonora; Romagnani, Sergio; Liotta, Francesco; Morettini, Alessandro; Rossolini, Gian Maria; Bartoloni, Alessandro; Cosmi, Lorenzo; Annunziato, Francesco",Eur J Immunol,99,16

In most of the countries, COVID-19 upsurge is uncontrolled with a significant mortality rate. Currently, no treatment effective for COVID-19 is available in the form of vaccines or antiviral drugs and patients are currently treated symptomatically. Although the majority of the patients develop mild symptoms and recover without mechanical ventilation for respiratory management, severe respiratory illness develops in a significant portion of affected patients and may result in death. While the scientific community is working to develop vaccines and drugs against the COVID-19 pandemic, novel alternative therapies may reduce the mortality rate. Recent use of stem cells for critically ill COVID-19 patients in a small group of patients in China and subsequent Emergency Use Authorization of stem cells by Food and Drug Administration to Global Institute of Stem Cell Therapy and Research and Athersys has created excitement among the medical community. As a result, several clinical trials have been registered using stem cells for COVID-19 treatment that aim to use different cell sources, dosage, and importantly diverse targeted patient groups. In this brief review, the possibilities of stem cell use in COVID-19 patients and relevant challenges in their use have been discussed.","Choudhery, Mahmood S; Harris, David T",Cell Biol Int,99,1

Additionally, type I HCs transmit via 'non-quantal' transmission to calyx afferent fibers, by accumulation of glutamate and potassium in the synaptic cleft. Vestibular efferent inputs originating in the brainstem contact type II HCs and vestibular afferents. Here, synaptic inputs to type II HCs were characterized by using electrical and optogenetic stimulation of efferent fibers combined with in vitro whole-cell patch-clamp recording from type II HCs in the rodent vestibular crista. Properties of efferent synaptic currents in type II HCs were similar to those found in cochlear HCs and mediated by activation of &#945;9-containing nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) and small-conductance calcium-activated potassium (SK) channels. While efferents showed a low probability of release at low frequencies of stimulation, repetitive stimulation resulted in facilitation and increased probability of release. Notably, the membrane potential of type II HCs during optogenetic stimulation of efferents showed a strong hyperpolarization in response to single pulses and was further enhanced by repetitive stimulation. Such efferent-mediated inhibition of type II HCs can provide a mechanism to adjust the contribution of signals from type I and type II HCs to vestibular nerve fibers, with a shift of the response to be more like that of calyx-only afferents with faster non-quantal responses.","Yu, Zhou; McIntosh, J Michael; Sadeghi, Soroush G; Glowatzki, Elisabeth",J. neurophysiol,99,20

The study aims to reduce the cost of healthcare application services as they are processing in the system. The study devises an IoMT system based on different algorithm techniques, such as Blockchain-Enable Smart-Contract Cost-Efficient Scheduling Algorithm Framework (BECSAF) schemes. Smart-Contract Blockchain schemes ensure data consistency and validation with symmetric cryptography. However, due to the different workflow tasks scheduled on other nodes, the heterogeneous, earliest finish, time-based scheduling deals with execution under their deadlines.

We examined the psychological status of nurses working in the tertiary women's and children's hospitals in Sichuan, China, in order to explore the possible effect of the COVID-19. The cross-sectional survey was conducted at the peak period of COVID-19 among 1971 nurses. Their anxiety, depression and self-efficacy were assessed by the seven-item anxiety scale (GAD-7), the nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), and the General Self-efficacy Scale (GSES), respectively. 1934 valid questionnaires were returned with a response rate of 98.1%. We found that 29.3% and 22.7% of the nurses were identified with anxiety and depressive symptoms, respectively. The median score of GSES was 30, which was at the upper middle level among all populations. Nurses having longer working years and cold-like symptoms, those who were at work during breakout period and working in pediatric ward were significantly associated with the presence of anxiety and depression. Findings suggest that the epidemic of COVID-19 does not necessarily affect the psychological health of nurses working in women's and children's hospitals in Sichuan.

Objectives: This study examined the prospective relation of baseline financial strain (reported at the beginning of the pandemic) to problematic alcohol use one month later, as well as the moderating role of emotional nonacceptance. We hypothesized that financial strain would be more strongly associated with problematic alcohol use one month later among participants with high (vs. mean or low) levels of nonacceptance. Methods: Shortly after COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the WHO and national emergency by the U.S. President (on March 11 and 13, 2020, respectively), a U.S. nationwide community sample completed a prospective online study, including an initial assessment from March 27-April 5, 2020 and a one-month follow-up from April 27-May 21. Measures included the Family Economic Strain Scale, Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale, and Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test. Participants included 254 adults reporting some alcohol use (50.4% women; mean age = 41.8). Results: Baseline financial strain was significantly positively associated with problematic alcohol use one month later only among participants with high (b =.06, SE =.03, p =.037) versus mean (b =.01, SE =.02, p =.677) or low (b = -.04, SE =.02, p =.110) emotional nonacceptance.

METHODS: An electronic search of PubMed, Embase, Medline, MedRxiv, CNKI, and the Chinese Medical Journal Full Text Database following PRISMA guidelines was performed through April 18, 2020. Search terms included COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, pregnant women, infants, and vertical transmission. RESULTS: A total of 230 women with COVID-19 (154 deliveries, 66 ongoing pregnancies, and 10 abortions) and 156 newborns from 20 eligible studies were included in this systematic review. A total of 34.62% of the pregnant patients had obstetric complications, and 59.05% of patients displayed fever. Lymphopenia was observed in 40.71% of patients. A total of 5.19% of women received mechanical ventilation. Seven women were critically ill. One mother and two newborns died. A total of 24.74% of newborns were premature.

The present study undertakes a scoping review of research focused on telehealth in otolaryngology (teleotolaryngology) to identify key themes and commonly utilized outcome measures that will assist future development in this growing field. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases and reference review. REVIEW METHODS: Per guidelines of the PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews, we performed database queries using a comprehensive search strategy developed in collaboration with research librarians at the Columbia University Irving Medical Center. We identified 596 unique references to undergo title and abstract review by 2 independent reviewers, leaving 439 studies for full-text review. RESULTS: We included 285 studies for extraction of notable findings, leaving 262 unique studies after accounting for content overlap. We identified core outcome measures, including patient and provider satisfaction, costs and benefits, quality of care, feasibility, and access to care. Publication volume increased markedly over time, though only 4% of studies incorporated randomized study group assignment. Using an iterative approach to thematic development, we organized article content across 5 main themes: (1) exploration of teleotolaryngology evolution, (2) role in virtual clinical encounters, (3) applications in interdisciplinary care and educational initiatives, (4) emerging and innovative technologies, and (5) barriers to implementation. CONCLUSION: This scoping review of teleotolaryngology documents its evolution and identifies current use cases, limitations, and emerging applications, providing a foundation from which to build future studies, inform policy decision making, and facilitate implementation where appropriate.","Gonzalez, Joseph N; Axiotakis, Lucas G; Yu, Victoria X; Gudis, David A; Overdevest, Jonathan B",Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,99,10

This leads to the formation of highly dense and hierarchical echo chambers. We present the first systematic analysis of U.S. political train networks, which involve many thousands of hyper-partisan accounts. These accounts engage in various suspicious behaviors, including some that violate platform policies: we find evidence of inauthentic automated accounts, artificial inflation of friends and followers, and abnormal content deletion. The networks are also responsible for amplifying toxic content from low-credibility and conspiratorial sources. Platforms may be reluctant to curb this kind of abuse for fear of being accused of political bias.

Here, we show that the virulence factor Nsp1 protein of SARS-CoV-2 interacts with the host messenger RNA (mRNA) export receptor heterodimer NXF1-NXT1, which is responsible for nuclear export of cellular mRNAs. Nsp1 prevents proper binding of NXF1 to mRNA export adaptors and NXF1 docking at the nuclear pore complex. As a result, a significant number of cellular mRNAs are retained in the nucleus during infection. Increased levels of NXF1 rescues the Nsp1-mediated mRNA export block and inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection. Thus, antagonizing the Nsp1 inhibitory function on mRNA export may represent a strategy to restoring proper antiviral host gene expression in infected cells.","Zhang, Ke; Miorin, Lisa; Makio, Tadashi; Dehghan, Ishmael; Gao, Shengyan; Xie, Yihu; Zhong, Hualin; Esparza, Matthew; Kehrer, Thomas; Kumar, Anil; Hobman, Tom C; Ptak, Christopher; Gao, Boning; Minna, John D; Chen, Zhijian; García-Sastre, Adolfo; Ren, Yi; Wozniak, Richard W; Fontoura, Beatriz M A",Sci.

In particular, we urge a mechanistic focus on the zoonotic pathogen infect-shed-spill-spread cascade to enable protection of landscape immunity-the ecological conditions that reduce the risk of pathogen spillover from reservoir hosts-as a conservation and biosecurity priority. Results are urgently needed to formulate an integrated, holistic set of science-based policy and management measures that effectively and cost-efficiently minimise zoonotic disease risk.

General Practitioners/Family Doctors (GPs/FDs) play a vital role in public vaccination in most countries and they also serve as role models. However, they may not always follow national vaccination policies. This study was carried out in order to ascertain the degree of vaccine hesitancy of GPs and GP trainees in Malta vis-à-vis influenza vaccination and a putative novel COVID-19 vaccine. METHODS: A short, anonymous questionnaire was emailed via the Malta College of Family Doctors. RESULTS: There were 123 responses from 288 GPs (33.3%) and 62 trainees (43.5%). Significantly more will take the influenza vaccine, at all ages. Almost two thirds of GPs are likely to take the COVID-19 vaccine but significantly less (a third) of trainees will. Older doctors were likelier to take this vaccine. The likelihood of taking influenza vaccination was significantly associated with that of taking COVID-19 vaccine. The majority of COVID-19 concerns pertained to insufficient knowledge and concern regarding potential long-term side effects. DISCUSSION: The vaccination rates for COVID-19 are somewhat less than those for influenza uptake. Vaccine hesitancy in the young, and here in young doctors, is a seemingly global youth phenomenon, an unwise insouchance when the possibility of long-term viral complications is considered. An information drive should be mounted with regard to COVID-19 vaccination as well as a campaign to heavily promote annual influenza vaccination.","Grech, Victor; Bonnici, Jason; Zammit, Dorothy",Early Hum Dev,99,24

Assessments have been conducted into the short-term cognitive effects of nicotine and into diseases such as Parkinson's, Tourette syndrome, ADHD or ulcerative colitis. METHODS: Analyses of nicotine administration protocols and safety were conducted after reviewing Medline and Science Direct databases performing a search using the words [transdermal nicotine] AND [non-smoker] AND selected diseases. RESULTS: Among 298 articles identified, there were 35 reviewed publications reporting on 33 studies of non-smokers receiving transdermal nicotine for >48hours. In the 16 randomized trials, 7 crossover, 1 case/control and 9 open studies patients received an initial nicotine dose of between 2.5mg and 15mg/day. In 22 studies, daily doses increased by 2 to 7 steps in 3 to 96 days until the dose was between 5mg and 105mg/day. The target nicotine dose was 19.06±20.89mg/day. The 987 non-smokers (534 never-smokers, 326 ex-smokers and 127 classified as ""non-smokers"") received or did not receive nicotine. The most common side-effects were nausea and skin itching. Forty-three (7.1%) non-smokers stopped treatment because of an adverse event of nicotine. No hospitalization related to nicotine side-effects were reported. CONCLUSION: Despite a relatively safe tolerance profile, transdermal nicotine therapy in non-smokers can only be used in clinical trials. There is a lack of formal assessment of the potential risk of developing a tobacco addiction. This review offers baseline data to set a transdermal nicotine protocol for non-smokers with a new purpose.","Dautzenberg, B; Levi, A; Adler, M; Gaillard, R",Respir Med Res,99,16

However, direct viral infection is not the only way that the former can affect the latter. Most adverse maternal events that end in hospitals have their genesis upstream in communities. Hospitals often represent a last opportunity to reverse a process that begins at a remove in space and time. The COVID-19 pandemic did not create these upstream injuries, but it has brought them to national attention, exacerbated them, and highlighted the need for health care providers to move out of the footprint of their institutions. The breach between community events that seed morbidity and hospitals that attempt rescues has grown in recent years, as the gap between rich and poor has grown and as maternity services in minority communities have closed. COVID-19 has become yet another barrier. For example, professional organizations have recommended a reduced number of prenatal visits, and the platforms hospitals use to substitute for some of these visits are not helpful to people who either lack the technology or the safe space in which to have confidential conversations with providers. Despite these challenges, there are opportunities for departments of obstetrics and gynecology. Community-based organizations including legal professionals, health-home coordinators, and advocacy groups, surround almost every hospital, and can be willing partners with interested departments. COVID-19 has made it clearer than ever that it is time to step out of the footprint of our institutions, and to recognize that the need to find upstream opportunities to prevent downstream tragedies.

The conclusions inferred from data can greatly guide us to make informative decisions. Big data has enabled us to carry out countless prediction tasks in conjunction with machine learning, such as identifying high risk patients suffering from a certain disease and taking preventable measures. However, healthcare practitioners are not content with mere predictions - they are also interested in the cause-effect relation between input features and clinical outcomes. Understanding such relations will help doctors treat patients and reduce the risk effectively. Causality is typically identified by randomized controlled trials. Often such trials are not feasible when scientists and researchers turn to observational studies and attempt to draw inferences. However, observational studies may also be affected by selection and/or confounding biases that can result in wrong causal conclusions. In this chapter, we will try to highlight some of the drawbacks that may arise in traditional machine learning and statistical approaches to analyze the observational data, particularly in the healthcare data analytics domain. We will discuss causal inference and ways to discover the cause-effect from observational studies in healthcare domain. Moreover, we will demonstrate the applications of causal inference in tackling some common machine learning issues such as missing data and model transportability. Finally, we will discuss the possibility of integrating reinforcement learning with causality as a way to counter confounding bias.","Zhang, Wenhao; Ramezani, Ramin; Naeim, Arash",,99,16

Pandemic-related health anxiety and worries about getting COVID-19 can lead to generalized anxiety and anxiety somatization, which, together with insalubrious daily life habits, are risk factors of worsening somatic health in people with SARS-Cov-2 infection. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The current study is a part of the COMET-G project (40 countries, n=55589;approved by the Ethics Committee of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki), which represents an intermediate analysis of data collected anonymously via online links from a national sample of the Russian general population (n=9936, 31.09+/-12.16 y.o., 58.7% females) to estimate anxiety using STAI-S and self-reported changes in anxiety and life habits (physical activity, nutrition and weight, internet use, sleep) during the lockdown. All statistical calculations (descriptive statistics, between group comparisons using chi-square test, MANOVA, ANOVA, significant at p<0.05) were performed with IBM SPSS 27. RESULTS: Overall STAI-S scores were 29+/-5.4, a subjective feeling of anxiety increase was reported in 40.3% of respondents (43.9% significantly > in females), worsening to clinical anxiety in 2.1% (2.4% > in females). 54.2% of respondents reported decreased physical activity, 33.1% gained weight, 72% used internet more often, 52.6% experienced worries related to the information about COVID-19 (56.8% > in females). 88% experienced worsened sleep quality, 69.2% stayed up until late, 23.2% took sleeping pills, and 31% had nightmares in which they felt trapped. To ANOVA, such life habits as reduced physical activity during the lockdown, increased time spent online, internet browsing about COVID-19, tendency to stay up late, use of sleeping pills and disturbing dreams with scenario of being trapped were significantly related to worsening of clinical anxiety. However, eating behaviour, weight changes, and social media use did not contribute to the clinical anxiety increase. CONCLUSIONS: Factors of decreased physical activity and sleep disturbances related to the lockdown, as well as excessive internet browsing for information about COVID-19, emerged as risk factors for increased anxiety, more notably in women than in men. Preventive measures should be targeted against relevant factors imparting anxiety in the vulnerable population.","Smirnova, D.; Syunyakov, T.; Pavlichenko, A.; Bragin, D.; Fedotov, I.; Filatova, V.; Ignatenko, Y.; Kuvshinova, N.; Prokopenko, E.; Romanov, D.; Spikina, A.; Yashikhina, A.; Morozov, P.; Fountoulakis, K.

However, the rates of vaccination coverage vary considerably between countries. While looking at COVID-19 vaccination from a different perspective, it brings up the following question: is equitable vaccine delivery and access the only critical issue? Assessing facilitators and barriers to successful vaccination initiatives should be carefully considered and addressed by subsequent actions. The COVID-19 vaccination campaigns as part of disease prevention programs could be embedded in the core of theories for a more systematic approach to enhance vaccine acceptance among people. For effective implementation of public health programs, it is imperative to understand human health behaviours and to have sufficient knowledge about cultural and environmental influences. Sufficient and satisfactory COVID-19 vaccine uptake is not only challenged by the availability of vaccines or their distribution, but also with cultural and social norms in the community as well as the complexity of human behaviours. Therefore, the global efforts should target communities with theory-based health promotion and awareness programs in parallel with vaccination campaigns as a part of public health practice.","Al-Tammemi, Ala’a B.; Tarhini, Zeinab",Public Health in Practice,99,1

DESIGN: A qualitative study design was used in addition to administration of standardized depression and mental status screens. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Veterans (n = 18) and caregivers (n = 14) were purposively sampled and recruited from 2 rural CLCs in Upstate New York. METHODS: Semistructured interviews were completed with Veterans in the CLC prior to discharge (to explore experiences during the CLC stay and expectations regarding discharge and returning home) and in the home 2-4 weeks postdischarge (to explore daily routines and perceptions of overall health, mental health, and social functioning). Caregivers participated in 1 interview, completed postdischarge. The 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire and the Brief Interview for Mental Status were administered postdischarge. RESULTS: Thematic analysis of verbatim transcriptions revealed 3 inter-related themes: (1) Veterans may experience improved social connectedness in CLCs by nature of the unique care environment (predominantly male, shared military experience); (2) Experiences of social engagement and connectedness varied after discharge and could be discordant with Veterans' expectations for recovery prior to discharge; and (3) Veterans may or may not describe themselves as ""lonely"" after discharge, when physically isolated. Veterans lacked moderate to severe cognitive impairment (Brief Interview for Mental Status: range = 14-15); however, they reported a wide range in depressive symptom severity postdischarge (9-item Patient Health Questionnaire: mean = 4.9, SD = 6.1, median/mode = 3, range = 0-23). CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: This study identified a potential for increased social isolation and disengagement after discharge from Veterans Affairs nursing homes.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: An observational evaluation from a self-reported questionnaire on behavioral changes and glycemic information from flash glucose monitoring (FGM) during the lockdown in 1,378 individuals living with type 1 diabetes who used a French dedicated nationwide web application (CoviDIAB). RESULTS: The main outcome was the change of the mean glucose level 2 months before and 1 month after the lockdown. We found that mean glucose improved from 9.1 ± 1.7 mmol/L to 8.7 ± 1.7 mmol/L (P < 0.001). Factors associated with better glycemic control were a decrease of alcohol consumption (odds ratio [OR] 1.75 [95% CI 1.04-2.94]), an increase in the frequency of FGM scans (OR 1.48 [1.04-2.10]) and in the number of hypoglycemia events (OR 1.67 [1.13-2.46]), and an easier diabetes control perception (OR 1.71 [1.18-2.49]).

Objective Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze the physical activity, sleep and eating habits of adults and the elderly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method A cross-sectional study with a sample comprising 135 participants, divided by age group. First, the whole group was divided into age groups with a 10-year cut-off. They were then characterized by sex, type of home, eating habits, sleep, and physical activity. For the second analysis, the participants were organized into three groups: young adults (18-40 years), middle-aged adults (41-60 years) and elderly (&gt;60 years). An online questionnaire was sent to all the participants, with 26 questions focusing on eating habits, sleep, protective behaviors against COVID-19, and physical activity. Results The participants were mainly women (85.9%), external community (71.1%), students' families (17.1%), teachers and staff (11.8%). Of the total participants, 40% were dedicated to home care activities and 21.1% had started working from home. The remainder (38.9%) were engaged in activities such as studying or caring for dependents. The younger age group (18-40 years old) reported spending more time in sedentary activities during the day, and 34.2% did not perform physical activity and ate lower quality food during social isolation (p&lt;0.01). All groups, with the exception of the 30-40 age group (p &lt;0.01) highlighted the importance of having the presence of a teacher responsible for guiding physical activities during isolation.

The four main challenges the Cameroonian educational authorities found themselves facing at the onset of the pandemic were (1) how to ensure continuity of formal education; (2) how to minimise exacerbation of already existing educational inequalities; (3) which tools to choose for ensuring continuity; and (4) how to enable pupils and students at exam stage to progress to the next level of their academic career. To collect relevant data for his analysis of how these challenges have been addressed, the author used three tools: documentary analysis, interviews, and digital observation of distance learning platforms. His findings form a detailed panorama of educational responses to COVID-19 in Cameroon. These include institutional, community and individual initiatives, ranging from paper-based materials to distance learning platforms, TV and radio communication tools. The implementation of these approaches, however, has revealed that the Cameroonian education system is plagued by disorganisation, educational inequalities and exclusion - problems which affect learners' daily lives on a personal level. The structural and pedagogical deficits revealed by the findings of this study demonstrate that Cameroon must insist on two things if it wants to guarantee educational normality in the event of other similar crises, namely (1) integrating distance-learning technologies; and (2) improving access to essential socio-educational services.","Béché, Emmanuel",Int Rev Educ,99,16

It is a critical resource for the food industry with wide uses. In most of the food preparation and processing operations, water is often taken for granted. Water is very commonly used in food production at various levels, apart from being used as an ingredient. Water quality and its impact on food products and various operations in food industries are often underestimated. Such underestimation often leads to mismanagement of water, equipment operation and maintenance issues, loss of revenue, food safety, and product quality. This chapter deals with several aspects of water as applicable to the food production. Agriculture is the largest consumer of water, requiring over 100 times more than that used for personal needs. The concept of water footprint is used to discern the importance of relative value in terms of water. The water footprint of any animal product is larger than the water footprint of a wisely chosen crop product with equivalent nutritional value. The production of meat requires between 6 and 20 times more water than for cereals and vegetables or fruits. Water is indispensible in cleaning and sanitization in food production, which is an integral part in processing operations in food production. In food storage and preservation, water plays a key role. The water activity of food helps a great deal in deciding shelf-life and food safety. The quality of water is the fundamental consideration in any food production process. The quality depends on the source of water and the actual application in food production. The pollution of water occurs at any stage in various ways. Physical, chemical, or biological agents cause significant health hazards in safe production of food. Contamination of water by several pathological microorganisms creates major challenges in food safety and threats to human and animal health. The majority of diseases which are transmitted through contaminated fresh water, are caused by pathogenic microorganisms. Whenever water is used as an ingredient in food product, it must be free from undesirable taste, odor, color, and impurities, including pathogenic organisms that could jeopardize consumers’ health and gravely affect product quality. The quality of water must adhere to the safe drinking water standard. Various techniques and methods of water treatments should be used to purify water as per the guidelines of government authorities to improve food safety. Soil has multiple roles in deciding water quality. Good quality soil has better ability to remove all types of contaminants of water, whereas deteriorated soil becomes a source of heavy metals, organic chemicals, and soil pathogens in water contamination. Use of genetically modified food is gaining much publicity recently. Even though a controversial topic, great care must be taken when genetically modified food is used. It is mandatory that one should review the basic principles of food safety before consuming any food.","Bhagwat, Vinod R.",Food Safety and Human Health,99,20

Its coding region constitutes less than 50% of the complete gene length, enabling SH gene to be highly variable and the SH protein highly conserved. In standard HRSV molecular epidemiology studies, solely sequences of the second hypervariable region of the glycoprotein gene (HVR2) are analyzed. To what extent do the strains identical in HVR2 differ elsewhere in genomes is rarely investigated. Our goal was to investigate whether diversity and inter-genotype differences observed for HVR2 are also present in the SH gene. METHODS: We sequenced 198 clinical samples collected within a limited area and time frame. In this HRSV collection, rapid and significant changes in HVR2 occurred. RESULTS: Over 20% of strains from this pool (containing HRSV genotypes NA1, ON1, GA5, BA9 and BA10) would be incorrectly assumed to be identical to another strain if only the HVR2 region was analysed. The majority of differences found in SH gene were located in the 5′ untranslated region (UTR). Seven indels were detected, one was genotype GA5 specific. An in-frame deletion of 9 nucleotides (coding for amino acids 49–51) was observed in one of group A strains. Fifteen different SH protein sequences were detected; 68% of strains possessed the consensus sequence and most of others differed from the consensus in only one amino acid (only 4 strains differed in 2 amino acids). The majority of differing amino acids in group A viruses had the same identity as the corresponding amino acids in group B strains. When analysis was restricted to strains with identical HVR2 nucleotide sequences and differing SH protein sequences, 75% of differences observed in the SH ectodomain were located within region coding for amino acids 49–51. CONCLUSIONS: Basing HRSV molecular epidemiology studies solely on HVR2 largely underestimates the complexity of circulating virus populations. In strain identification, broadening of the genomic target sequence to SH gene would provide a more comprehensive insight into viral pool versatility and its evolutionary processes.

Unfortunately, there is no mature cold chain disinfection technique yet. In this study, a low-temperature plasma disinfection technique for a cold chain is proposed. The disinfection effect of plasma generated by surface dielectric barrier discharge on Escherichia coli in ice at cryogenic temperature is studied, and the possible disinfection mechanism is discussed. It is found that the O(3) mode and the NO(x) mode also exist in the surface dielectric barrier discharge at cryogenic temperature, just as at room temperature. The disinfection effect of both modes is weak in 5 min plasma treatment, but in 60 min post-treatment, the NO(x) mode shows a stronger disinfection effect, with 4.45 log reduction. It is speculated that gaseous H(2)O(2) and NO(x) can be adsorbed on the ice surface in the NO(x) mode and then converted into peroxynitrite, which is a powerful bactericidal species. In conclusion, a low-temperature plasma is a promising technique for cold chain disinfection, which is of great significance for ensuring people's health.","Guo, Yuntao; Liu, Peipei; Zhang, Liyang; Peng, Siqi; Wang, Xinxin; Luo, Haiyun; Wu, Guizhen",Appl Phys Lett,99,17

Settlement projects attract agents whose clearing reflects land accumulation and the economic importance of deforestation. We used a mixed-method approach in the Rio Juma Settlement to examine colonization and deforestation trajectories for 35 years at three scales of analysis: the entire landscape, cohorts of settlement lots divided by occupation periods, and lots grouped by landholding size per household. All sizes of landholdings are deforesting much more than before, and current political and economic forces favoring the agribusiness sector foreshadow increasing rates of forest clearing for pasture establishment in Apuí. The area cleared per year over the 2013–2018 period in Apuí grew by a percentage more than twice the corresponding percentage for the Brazilian Amazon as a whole. With the national congress and presidential administration signaling impunity for illegal deforestation, wealthy actors, and groups are investing resources in land grabbing and land accumulation, with land speculation being a crucial deforestation factor. This paper is unique in providing causal explanations at the decision-maker’s level on how deforestation trajectories are linked to economic and political events (period effects) at the larger scales, adding to the literature by showing that such effects were more important than aging and cohort effects as explanations for deforestation trajectories. Additional research is needed to deepen our understanding of relations between land speculation, illegal possession of public lands, and the expansion of agricultural frontiers in Amazonia.","Carrero, Gabriel Cardoso; Fearnside, Philip Martin; do Valle, Denis Ribeiro; de Souza Alves, Cristiano",Environ Manage,99,20

A resurgence in COVID-19 cases has been reported in some countries that lifted some of these NPIs. We aimed to understand the association of introducing and lifting NPIs with the level of transmission of SARS-CoV-2, as measured by the time-varying reproduction number (R), from a broad perspective across 131 countries. METHODS: In this modelling study, we linked data on daily country-level estimates of R from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (London, UK) with data on country-specific policies on NPIs from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker, available between Jan 1 and July 20, 2020. We defined a phase as a time period when all NPIs remained the same, and we divided the timeline of each country into individual phases based on the status of NPIs. We calculated the R ratio as the ratio between the daily R of each phase and the R from the last day of the previous phase (ie, before the NPI status changed) as a measure of the association between NPI status and transmission of SARS-CoV-2. We then modelled the R ratio using a log-linear regression with introduction and relaxation of each NPI as independent variables for each day of the first 28 days after the change in the corresponding NPI. In an ad-hoc analysis, we estimated the effect of reintroducing multiple NPIs with the greatest effects, and in the observed sequence, to tackle the possible resurgence of SARS-CoV-2. FINDINGS: 790 phases from 131 countries were included in the analysis. A decreasing trend over time in the R ratio was found following the introduction of school closure, workplace closure, public events ban, requirements to stay at home, and internal movement limits; the reduction in R ranged from 3% to 24% on day 28 following the introduction compared with the last day before introduction, although the reduction was significant only for public events ban (R ratio 0·76, 95% CI 0·58–1·00); for all other NPIs, the upper bound of the 95% CI was above 1. An increasing trend over time in the R ratio was found following the relaxation of school closure, bans on public events, bans on public gatherings of more than ten people, requirements to stay at home, and internal movement limits; the increase in R ranged from 11% to 25% on day 28 following the relaxation compared with the last day before relaxation, although the increase was significant only for school reopening (R ratio 1·24, 95% CI 1·00–1·52) and lifting bans on public gatherings of more than ten people (1·25, 1·03–1·51); for all other NPIs, the lower bound of the 95% CI was below 1. It took a median of 8 days (IQR 6–9) following the introduction of an NPI to observe 60% of the maximum reduction in R and even longer (17 days [14–20]) following relaxation to observe 60% of the maximum increase in R. In response to a possible resurgence of COVID-19, a control strategy of banning public events and public gatherings of more than ten people was estimated to reduce R, with an R ratio of 0·71 (95% CI 0·55–0·93) on day 28, decreasing to 0·62 (0·47–0·82) on day 28 if measures to close workplaces were added, 0·58 (0·41–0·81) if measures to close workplaces and internal movement restrictions were added, and 0·48 (0·32–0·71) if measures to close workplaces, internal movement restrictions, and requirements to stay at home were added. INTERPRETATION: Individual NPIs, including school closure, workplace closure, public events ban, ban on gatherings of more than ten people, requirements to stay at home, and internal movement limits, are associated with reduced transmission of SARS-CoV-2, but the effect of introducing and lifting these NPIs is delayed by 1–3 weeks, with this delay being longer when lifting NPIs. These findings provide additional evidence that can inform policy-maker decisions on the timing of introducing and lifting different NPIs, although R should be interpreted in the context of its known limitations.

The oral mucosa and saliva are high risk sites for higher viral loads and dental health care professionals are considered a high risk group. COVID-19-induced oral lesions and loss of taste and smell are common clinical complaints in the dental health care setting. The SARS-CoV-2 virus has been found to cause a wide range of non-specific oral mucosal lesions, but the specific diagnosis of these mucocutaneous lesions as COVID-19 lesions will facilitate the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 in dental health care settings and aid in proper patient management. The reported loss of taste and smell needs further investigation at the receptor level as it will give new insights into SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity. The high yield of virus in the salivary secretion is a common finding in this infection and ongoing research is focusing on developing saliva as a rapid diagnostic fluid in COVID-19. In this review, we discuss the significance of oral mucosa, saliva and the relevance of the COVID-19 pandemic in dentistry.","Atukorallaya, Devi Sewvandini; Ratnayake, Ravindra K.",Front Med (Lausanne),99,11

During this study, a completely randomized experiment was designed to investigate the efficacy of different levels (0 to 16%) of N. sativa seeds supplemented in the diet of broilers on performance, immune responses, and hematological and biochemical parameters. The results indicated the following: (a) Supplementation of 1% N. sativa seeds in diet had the highest positive effects and 16% N. sativa had the highest significant (p=0.03) adverse effects on weight gain, while up to 2% N. sativa seeds in the diet reduced feed conversion ratio (FCR) whereas 4% and over that increased the FCR. (b) Chickens fed with a diet containing 1% N. sativa seeds had the highest antibody titers, but those fed with 16% N. sativa seeds had the lowest antibody titers at end of the experiment. (c) Dietary inclusion of N. sativa seeds increased hemogram parameters and the group fed with 16% N. sativa seeds had the highest values on day 21 until the end of the experiment. (d) Supplementation of N. sativa seeds decreased in WBC and lymphocytes but increased heterophils, H/L, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils percentages. Supplementation of up to 2% of N. sativa seeds in broiler's diets elaborated serum level of those parameters, while supplementation of ≥ 4% N. sativa seeds decreased their serum levels. In conclusion, supplementation of N. sativa seed (1-2%) in broiler diets, as a multipurpose natural growth promoter, improves performance, elevates humoral immune responses, affects serum biochemical profiles of broiler chickens, and induces changes in their hemogram and leukogram, while there are no side, residual, and hazardous effects.","Talebi, Alireza; Maham, Masoud; Asri-Rezaei, Siamak; Pournaghi, Pouya; Khorrami, Mohammad-Sadegh; Derakhshan, Amir",Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,99,20

A mini-review of current evidence,15.564516,8.483754,2021-07-21,"INTRODUCTION: Diet, shown to impact colorectal cancer (CRC) risk, is a modifiable environmental factor. Fibre foods fermented by gut microbiota produce metabolites that not only provide food for the colonic epithelium but also exert regulatory effects on colonic mucosal inflammation and proliferation. We describe methods used in a double-blinded, randomised, controlled trial with Alaska Native (AN) people to determine if dietary fibre supplementation can substantially reduce CRC risk among people with the highest reported CRC incidence worldwide. METHODS AND ANALYSES: Eligible patients undergoing routine screening colonoscopy consent to baseline assessments and specimen/data collection (blood, urine, stool, saliva, breath and colon mucosal biopsies) at the time of colonoscopy. Following an 8-week stabilisation period to re-establish normal gut microbiota post colonoscopy, study personnel randomise participants to either a high fibre supplement (resistant starch, n=30) or placebo (digestible starch, n=30) condition, repeating stool sample collection. During the 28-day supplement trial, each participant consumes their usual diet plus their supplement under direct observation. On day 29, participants undergo a flexible sigmoidoscopy to obtain mucosal biopsy samples to measure the effect of the supplement on inflammatory and proliferative biomarkers of cancer risk, with follow-up assessments and data/specimen collection similar to baseline. Secondary outcome measures include the impact of a high fibre supplement on the oral and colonic microbiome and biofluid metabolome. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Approvals were obtained from the Alaska Area and University of Pittsburgh Institutional Review Boards and Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium and Southcentral Foundation research review bodies. A data safety monitoring board, material transfer agreements and weekly study team meetings provide regular oversight throughout the study.

The increase of the CRP concentration as well as a certain threshold concentration of CRP are indicative of clinical deterioration to artificial ventilation. In COVID-19, virus-induced lung injury and the subsequent massive onset of inflammation often drives pulmonary fibrosis. Fibrosis of the lung usually proceeds as sequela to a severe course of COVID-19 and its consequences only show months later. CRP-mediated complement- and macrophage activation is suspected to be the main driver of pulmonary fibrosis and subsequent organ failure in COVID-19. Recently, CRP apheresis was introduced to selectively remove CRP from human blood plasma. CASE REPORT: A 53-year-old, SARS-CoV-2 positive, male patient with the risk factor diabetes type 2 was referred with dyspnea, fever and fulminant increase of CRP. The patient’s lungs already showed a pattern enhancement as an early sign of incipient pneumonia. The oxygen saturation of the blood was ≤ 89%. CRP apheresis using the selective CRP adsorber (PentraSorb(®) CRP) was started immediately. CRP apheresis was performed via peripheral venous access on 4 successive days. CRP concentrations before CRP apheresis ranged from 47 to 133 mg/l. The removal of CRP was very effective with up to 79% depletion within one apheresis session and 1.2 to 2.14 plasma volumes were processed in each session. No apheresis-associated side effects were observed. It was at no point necessary to transfer the patient to the Intensive Care Unit or to intubate him due to respiratory failure. 10 days after the first positive SARS-CoV-2 test, CRP levels stayed below 20 mg/l and the patient no longer exhibited fever. Fourteen days after the first positive SARS-CoV-2 test, the lungs showed no sign of pneumonia on X-ray. CONCLUSION: This is the first report on CRP apheresis in an early COVID-19 patient with fulminant CRP increase. Despite a poor prognosis due to his diabetes and biomarker profile, the patient was not ventilated, and the onset of pneumonia was reverted.","Ringel, Jens; Ramlow, Anja; Bock, Christopher; Sheriff, Ahmed",Front Immunol,99,24

This results in severe disruptions of life routines, social isolation, and loss of freedom. Studies on psychological distress among Ethiopian migrant returnees in the context of COVID-19 are scarce. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of psychological distress and associated factors among migrant returnees who were in quarantine during the time of COVID-19. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted with 405 migrant returnees recruited from quarantine centers in Addis Ababa. We developed a structured questionnaire to collect data on sociodemographic, migration related, quarantine related and COVID-19 related characteristics of participants. We used the 21 item Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale to assess psychological distress. Univariate and multivariable negative binomial regression models were fitted to assess the association between exposure variables with depression, anxiety and stress separately. RESULTS: A little more than half of the participants (55%) had depressive symptoms; around half had anxiety symptoms (48.9%) and more than a third (35.6%) experienced symptoms of stress. We found significantly higher prevalence of anxiety (ARR = 0.59; 95% CI = 0.39, 0.91) and depressive symptoms (ARR = 0.56; 95% CI = 0.39, 0.81) among women than men. Fear of discrimination after the quarantine was significantly associated with depressive (ARR = 0.76; 95% CI = 0.63, 0.92) and anxiety symptoms (ARR = 0.77; 95% CI = 0.62, 0.97). Experiencing COVID-19 like symptoms is associated with depressive (ARR = 0.40; 95% CI = 0.25, 0.65), anxiety (ARR = 0.35; 95% CI = 0.20, 0.62) and stress symptoms (ARR = 0.43; 95% CI = 0.28, 0.66). Have no a plan of what to do after the quarantine (ARR = 1.30; 95% CI = 1.09, 1.54) was significantly associated with increasing stress scores. CONCLUSIONS: We found a very high prevalence of depressive, anxiety and stress symptoms among Ethiopian migrant returnees who were in quarantine due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Screening, integration of mental health services with other socioeconomic and psychosocial services, and effective and efficient referral may be useful to address the burden of psychological distress in this group.

Despite this, many countries have worked to ensure that child helplines remain operational, making such mechanisms even more critical for reporting and referring cases of violence and for providing support to victims. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this paper is to document what has occurred, and been reported, to child helplines during the COVID-19 pandemic. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: The study entailed primary data collection from child helplines and a search of media articles and news stories. METHODS: Child helplines submitted data on the contacts received during the first six months of 2020. Data on contacts related to violence were also available from 2019, and used as baseline. The media search used a combination of search terms to identify relevant articles and news stories published between March 1 st and June 17 th 2020. RESULTS: Overall, the number of contacts to helplines seems to have drastically increased since the beginning of the pandemic. However, the number of contacts related to violence has increased in some countries, while it decreased in others. CONCLUSIONS: While a mixed picture emerges with respect to violence, the increase in overall contacts made to helplines provides evidence that such services are a critical lifeline for many children and women during times of crisis. Child helplines should be strengthened, and child protection services should be designated as essential during emergencies to ensure children receive the support they need.","Petrowski, Nicole; Cappa, Claudia; Pereira, Andrea; Mason, Helen; Daban, Rocio Aznar",Child Abuse Negl,99,1

They were further tested for antibodies against the S1 domain of the SARS‐CoV‐2 spike protein (IgG, IgA) and against the viral nucleocapsid protein (IgG, IgM) using enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assays. The assay specificities were 94.4%–100%. The sensitivities varied largely between assays, reflecting their respective purposes. The sensitivities of IgA and IgM assays were the highest between 11 and 20 dpso, whereas the sensitivities of IgG assays peaked between 20 and 60 dpso. IIFT showed the highest sensitivities due to the use of the whole SARS‐CoV‐2 as substrate and provided information on whether or not the individual has been infected with SARS‐CoV‐2.

Severe respiratory symptoms are a hallmark of the disease, which may also include complications related to a hypercoagulable state and central nervous system involvement. These complications can occur during either the acute or the recovery phase. The cerebral involvement typically manifests as intracranial hypertension, intracerebral hemorrhage, diffuse encephalopathy, or cerebral venous thrombosis. The hemorrhagic form of cerebral venous thrombosis can be a diagnostic challenge and is treated by anticoagulation therapy, despite the existence of an intracerebral hemorrhage. This report describes a case of superficial cerebral venous thrombosis and intracerebral hematoma in a 48-year-old man weeks after recovering from the acute phase of SARSCoV-2 infection. CASE REPORT: A 48-year-old man with a past medical history of SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by SARS-CoV-2 reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction presented with left upper-limb numbness, weakness, and impaired positional sensorium. After initial stabilization, noncontrast computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging confirmed an intracerebral hemorrhage with underlying cerebral venous thrombosis. The patient was successfully treated with enoxaparin anticoagulation therapy, and symptoms improved over the following 12 days. CONCLUSIONS: Central nervous system venous thrombosis is an atypical presentation of the hypercoagulable state primarily seen in younger patients, and it can occur in a delayed fashion after recovery from mild forms of COVID-19.","Cardoso, Erico Ramos; Bains, Sandeep Singh; Robison, Benjamin; Farkas, Jeffrey",Am J Case Rep,99,8

With antibiotic resistance problem emergence, these infections can be challenging to eradicate. Hence, this study aimed to determine the microbial contamination of HCW MPs and identify and classify bacterial isolates in Palestine. METHODS: This was a 7-month comparative cross-sectional analysis of 200 HCW MPs from 2 hospitals and 100 MPs from university students (non-HCWs). Data collection was done using a self-administrated questionnaire, and a swab sample from both HCW and non-HCW MPs was obtained and transferred to An-Najah National University (NNU) microbiology lab for bacterial identification and antibiotic susceptibility. Data were analyzed using Social Sciences Statistical Package (SPSS) version 22.0. RESULT: Among HCWs, the microbial contamination was 87.5%. Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS; 67.3%), methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA; 17.5%), Gram-positive bacilli (4.1%), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA; 1.6%), and Gram-negative species (1.6%) were the most predominant bacterial isolates. More than half of staphylococci isolates were resistant to penicillin and erythromycin. Male gender, using a mobile phone in the bathroom, and entry to the operating theatre were associated with mobile phone contamination and increased resistance against specific antibiotics. Among non-HCWs, the contamination was 86%. The most predominant bacterial isolates were CoNS, MSSA, and Gram-positive bacilli, with a contamination of 66.8%, 28.5%, and 2.6%, respectively. No MRSA or Gram-negative species were detected in this group. Antibiotic resistance percentage of staphylococci was nearly half of that yielded in the HCW group against each antibiotic. CONCLUSION: Significant numbers of bacteria have been isolated from HCW MPs. Working in a hospital environment frequently raises the probability of presence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria on a MP. Therefore, infection control teams should discuss methods to prevent the transmission of drug-resistant pathogens from HCW MPs.","Qadi, Mohammad; Khayyat, Rasha; AlHajhamad, Mohammed A.; Naji, Yazan I.; Maraqa, Beesan; Abuzaitoun, Kais; Mousa, Ahmed; Daqqa, Maysa",Can J Infect Dis Med Microbiol,99,24

Loss of services and supports, heightened fears about increased infection rates, and disruption of daily routines likely adversely affect the well‐being of children with ASD and their families. The goal of this study was to examine differences in psychological distress–as defined by symptoms of anxiety, depression, loneliness, and hyperarousal–between parents raising a child with ASD and parents in the US as a whole during the early stages of the pandemic (March–April 2020). Parents raising a child with ASD (n = 3556) were recruited through SPARK, a national ASD research registry, whereas a representative sample of parents in the US (n = 5506) were recruited from the Pew Research Center's American Trends Panel. All data were captured via online surveys. Descriptive statistics and multivariable logistic regressions examined psychological distress at the item and summary score level. Parents of children with ASD reported higher levels of overall psychological distress (48% vs. 25%; aOR = 1.60, 95% CI: 1.32, 1.84, p < 0.001). Hyperarousal, or feelings of panic when thinking about COVID‐19, was particularly prevalent among parents of children with ASD compared to parents in the US (25% vs. 9%; aOR = 2.38, 95% CI: 1.83, 3.07, p < 0.001). Findings highlight the importance of considering the policies and practices that contribute to poor mental health in parents, particularly those raising a child with ASD, to ensure mental health services remain accessible. LAY SUMMARY: This study examined the mental health of parents raising a child with ASD during the early stages of the COVID‐19 pandemic. Results demonstrated substantially higher levels of psychological distress, particularly those related to feelings of panic, among parents raising a child with ASD when compared to parents in the US as a whole. These data suggest the need for ensuring mental health services are accessible to parents, particularly those raising a child with ASD, during and after the pandemic.","Kalb, Luther G.; Badillo‐Goicoechea, Elena; Holingue, Calliope; Riehm, Kira E.; Thrul, Johannes; Stuart, Elizabeth A.; Smail, Emily J.; Law, Kiely; White‐Lehman, Casey; Fallin, Daniele",Autism Res,99,26

Based on a validated 360-degree assessment simulating a first day of residency we developed a training for final-year medical students including patient consultation, patient management, and patient hand-off. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic the training was changed to a telemedicine format and evaluated. Methods: In 2019, 103 final-year students participated in a newly designed competence-based training including a consultation hour with simulated patients, a patient management phase with an electronic patient chart, and a case presentation in hand-off format. Due to social distancing regulations, the training was not allowed to take place in this way. Therefore, we changed the training to a telemedicine format. In May 2020, 32 students participated in the telemedicine training. A 5-point Likert scale (1: does not apply to 5: fully applies) was used for the evaluation items. The two formats were compared with t-tests. Results: The students were similarly satisfied with the content of the training independently of its format. Both groups found the patient cases interesting (presence: 4.68 ± 0.49, telemedicine: 4.66 ± 0.48). With respect to the telemedicine format, participants were glad that an option had been found that could be offered throughout the final year (4.94 ± 0.24) despite the COVID-19 pandemic and they regarded it as a very useful training for their final examination (4.94 ± 0.24). Conclusion: The telemedicine format of the competence-based training worked as well as the presence format.

In this context, an in silico molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation study on the existing 58 antiviral and antimalarial compounds was performed on 3CLpro, PLpro and RdRp SARS-CoV-2 proteins. The antiviral compounds are best fitted in the binding pockets and interact more profoundly with the amino acid residues compared to antimalarial compounds. An HIV protease inhibitor, saquinavir showed a good dock score and binding free energy with varied binding interactions against 3CLpro and PLpro. While, adefovir, a nucleotide HBV DNA polymerase inhibitor exhibited good dock score and binding interactions against RdRp. Although, the antimalarial compounds showed relatively less dock score but were found to be crucial in displaying essential binding interactions with these proteins. The MD simulation runs for 100 ns on 3CLpro-saquinavir, PLpro-saquinavir and RdRp-adefovir complexes using Desmond revealed fairly stable nature of interactions. This study helped in understanding the key interactions of the vital functionalities that provide a concrete base to develop lead molecules effective against SARS-CoV-2.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Causative agent is a novel coronavirus called Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2/2019-nCoV). While new line of drug/vaccine development has been initiated world-wide, in the current scenario of high infected numbers, severity of the disease and high morbidity, repurposing of the existing drugs is heavily explored. Here, we used a homology-based structural model of transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), a cell surface receptor, required for entry of virus to the target host cell. Using the strengths of molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations, we examined the binding potential of Withaferin-A (Wi-A), Withanone (Wi-N) and caffeic acid phenethyl ester to TPMRSS2 in comparison to its known inhibitor, Camostat mesylate. We found that both Wi-A and Wi-N could bind and stably interact at the catalytic site of TMPRSS2. Wi-N showed stronger interactions with TMPRSS2 catalytic residues than Wi-A and was also able to induce changes in its allosteric site. Furthermore, we investigated the effect of Wi-N on TMPRSS2 expression in MCF7 cells and found remarkable downregulation of TMPRSS2 mRNA in treated cells predicting dual action of Wi-N to block SARS-CoV-2 entry into the host cells. Since the natural compounds are easily available/affordable, they may even offer a timely therapeutic/preventive value for the management of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. We also report that Wi-A/Wi-N content varies in different parts of Ashwagandha and warrants careful attention for their use. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Despite these variations, some bat SARSr-CoVs can utilize the orthologs of the human SARS-CoV receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), for entry. It is speculated that the interaction between bat ACE2 and SARSr-CoV spike proteins drives diversity. Here, we identified a series of R. sinicus ACE2 variants with some polymorphic sites involved in the interaction with the SARS-CoV spike protein. Pseudoviruses or SARSr-CoVs carrying different spike proteins showed different infection efficiencies in cells transiently expressing bat ACE2 variants. Consistent results were observed by binding affinity assays between SARS-CoV and SARSr-CoV spike proteins and receptor molecules from bats and humans. All tested bat SARSr-CoV spike proteins had a higher binding affinity to human ACE2 than to bat ACE2, although they showed a 10-fold lower binding affinity to human ACE2 compared with that of their SARS-CoV counterpart. Structure modeling revealed that the difference in binding affinity between spike and ACE2 might be caused by the alteration of some key residues in the interface of these two molecules. Molecular evolution analysis indicates that some key residues were under positive selection. These results suggest that the SARSr-CoV spike protein and R. sinicus ACE2 may have coevolved over time and experienced selection pressure from each other, triggering the evolutionary arms race dynamics. IMPORTANCE Evolutionary arms race dynamics shape the diversity of viruses and their receptors. Identification of key residues which are involved in interspecies transmission is important to predict potential pathogen spillover from wildlife to humans. Previously, we have identified genetically diverse SARSr-CoVs in Chinese horseshoe bats. Here, we show the highly polymorphic ACE2 in Chinese horseshoe bat populations. These ACE2 variants support SARS-CoV and SARSr-CoV infection but with different binding affinities to different spike proteins. The higher binding affinity of SARSr-CoV spike to human ACE2 suggests that these viruses have the capacity for spillover to humans. The positive selection of residues at the interface between ACE2 and SARSr-CoV spike protein suggests long-term and ongoing coevolutionary dynamics between them. Continued surveillance of this group of viruses in bats is necessary for the prevention of the next SARS-like disease.","Guo, Hua; Hu, Bing-Jie; Yang, Xing-Lou; Zeng, Lei-Ping; Li, Bei; Ouyang, Songying; Shi, Zheng-Li",J Virol,99,23

This paper deals with perceived stress (PS) and cognitive efficiency (CE) in older adults with dementia during the first wave of the pandemic. The study also investigated the potential effects of PS and CE on participants' cognitive functioning. The modulating effect of cognitive reserve (CR) on these variables was also considered, given its well-known role in the onset and evolution of neurodegenerative diseases. METHOD Thirty-eight older adults with mild/moderate dementia (mean age: 81.47 ± 5.05; mean MMSE pre-lockdown: 24.03 ± 3.14) were recruited for this study from March to May [4]. Two questionnaires, the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and the FLEI Mental Ability Questionnaire (FLEI), were administered to all participants by telephone every two weeks during lockdown (T1: early April, T2: mid-April, T3: early May). After lockdown, their neuropsychological and psychological profiles were assessed. Linear mixed-effects models were used to investigate changes over time. RESULTS The level of PS increased at both Time 2 and Time 3 (f2 = 0.10). Cognitive functioning worsened during lockdown, resulting in lower scores at the post-lockdown evaluation (f2s = 0.09 and 0.06 for MMSE and ENB-2, respectively). The decrease in these scores was not associated with either PS or CE. Although the size of these effects was rather small, their clinical relevance is not negligible. CONCLUSION Individuals with dementia seem to have experienced stress (S) during the first-wave of lockdown related to Covid-19. Cognition worsened during the pandemic, in accordance with the neurodegenerative nature of the disease, but it was unrelated to PS and CE.","Paolini, Simone; Devita, Maria; Epifania, Ottavia M; Anselmi, Pasquale; Sergi, Giuseppe; Mapelli, Daniela; Coin, Alessandra",Journal of psychosomatic research,99,1

A study by the Rossy Cancer Network (RCN) of McGill university assessed six aspects of the patient experience among cancer patients and found that emotional support is the aspect most lacking. To improve this support, trained patient advisors (PAs) can be included as full-fledged members of the healthcare team, given that PA can rely on their knowledge with experiencing the disease and from using health and social care services to accompany cancer patients, they could help to round out the health and social care services offer in oncology. However, the feasibility of integrating PAs in clinical oncology teams has not been studied. In this multisite study, we will explore how to integrate PAs in clinical oncology teams and, under what conditions this can be successfully done. We aim to better understand effects of this PA intervention on patients, on the PAs themselves, the health and social care team, the administrators, and on the organization of services and to identify associated ethical and legal issues. METHODS/DESIGN: We will conduct six mixed methods longitudinal case studies. Qualitative data will be used to study the integration of the PAs into clinical oncology teams and to identify the factors that are facilitators and inhibitors of the process, the associated ethical and legal issues, and the challenges that the PAs experience. Quantitative data will be used to assess effects on patients, PAs and team members, if any, of the PA intervention. The results will be used to support oncology programs in the integration of PAs into their healthcare teams and to design a future randomized pragmatic trial to evaluate the impact of PAs as full-fledged members of clinical oncology teams on cancer patients’ experience of emotional support throughout their care trajectory. DISCUSSION: This study will be the first to integrate PAs as full-fledged members of the clinical oncology team and to assess possible clinical and organizational level effects. Given the unique role of PAs, this study will complement the body of research on peer support and patient navigation. An additional innovative aspect of this study will be consideration of the ethical and legal issues at stake and how to address them in the health care organizations.

As a result, frailty rates are expected to increase, and frailty is expected to worsen as a secondary problem associated with COVID-19 countermeasures. Therefore, this study aims to determine the extent of frailty in the elderly associated with lifestyle changes implemented as COVID-19 countermeasures, to ascertain actual lifestyle changes and clarify the existence of Corona-Frailty. We will also conduct Corona-Frailty screening to verify the effect of support provided as feedback to supporters of the elderly. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The survey target area is Takasaki City, Gunma Prefecture, Japan. Phase I aims to verify the short-term effects of COVID-19. A questionnaire will be distributed to 465 community-dwelling elderly people, and responses will be obtained by post. Frailty will be evaluated using the Frailty Screening Index. Respondents who are frail and have had many changes in their lifestyle will be screened as high-risk people, and feedback will be provided to local supporters. The aim of Phase II will be to verify the long-term effects of COVID-19 and the effect of screening. A similar survey will be distributed twice after the first survey, once after 6 months and again after 1 year and the frailty rate will be tested. Furthermore, out of the subjects identified with frailty in Phase I, the progress of those who were screened and those who were not screened will be compared between groups. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study has been approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the Takasaki University of Health and Welfare (approval number: 2009). The results of this study will be reported to the policymaker, presented at academic conferences and published in peer-reviewed journals.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the risk of ICU admission and morality risk in diabetic COVID-19 patients. STUDY DESING: A database search was conducted to identify studies comparing diabetic COVID-19 patients hospitalized in intensive care unit (ICU) and those reporting the overall mortality of these patients published up to March 25, 2020 within MEDLINE, Scopus and Web of Science. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed in abstracting data and assessing validity. Quality assessment was performed using the Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment scale. The main outcome was the risk of ICU admission in diabetic patients with COVID-19 infection while the second was the mortality risk in overall diabetic COVID-19 patients. Data were pooled using the Mantel-Haenszel random effects models with odds ratio (OR) as the effect measure with the related 95 % confidence interval (CI). Statistical heterogeneity between groups was measured using the Higgins I(2) statistic. RESULTS: Among 1382 patients (mean age 51.5 years, 798 males), DM resulted to be the second more frequent comorbidities. Diabetic patients resulted to have a significant increased risk of ICU admission (OR: 2.79, 95 % CI 1.85–4.22, p < 0.0001, I(2) = 46 %).

For this study, we conducted a large‐scale comparative genome study of MERS‐CoV from both human and dromedary camels from 2012 to 2019 to map any genetic changes that emerged in the past 8 years. We downloaded 1309 submissions, including 308 full‐length genome sequences of MERS‐CoV available in GenBank from 2012 to 2019. We used bioinformatics tools to describe the genome structure and organization of the virus and to map the most important motifs within various regions/genes throughout the genome over the past 8 years. We also monitored variations/mutations among these sequences since its emergence. Our phylogenetic analyses suggest that the cluster within African camels is derived by S gene. We identified some prominent motifs within the ORF1ab, S gene and ORF‐5, which may be used for barcoding the African camel lineages of MERS‐CoV. Furthermore, we mapped some sequence patterns that support the zoonotic origin of the virus from dromedary camels. Other sequences identified selection pressures, particularly within the N gene and the 5′ UTR.

This study aimed to determine the performance of pneumococcal load quantified with a real-time polymerase-chain reaction in nasopharyngeal samples to diagnose invasive pneumococcal disease in children. METHODS: Matched case-control study of patients <5 years of age with invasive pneumococcal disease admitted to the Manhiça District Hospital (Mozambique) and asymptomatic controls recruited in different periods between 2006 and 2014. Cases were confirmed by a positive bacterial culture for S. pneumoniae in blood or cerebrospinal fluid. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected from cases and controls and pneumococcal density was quantified by lytA real-time polymerase-chain reaction. RESULTS: Thirty cases (median age 12.8 months) and sixty controls (median age 11.7 months) were enrolled and 70% of them were male. Nasopharyngeal pneumococcal carriage was high in both groups: 28/30 (93.3%) for cases vs. 53/60 (88.3%) for controls (p = 0.71). Mean nasopharyngeal pneumococcal load was identified as a marker for invasive pneumococcal disease (7.0 log(10) copies/mL in cases vs. 5.8 log(10) copies/mL in controls, p<0.001) and showed good discriminatory power (AUC-ROC: 82.1%, 95% CI 72.5%-91.8%). A colonization density of 6.5 log(10) copies/mL was determined as the optimal cut-off value to distinguish cases from controls (sensitivity 75.0%, specificity 73.6%).

Method: A rapid systematic review was conducted by searching the PubMed, Embase, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure databases on April 13, 2020. Three clinical trial registry platforms, including ClinicalTrials.gov, the EU Clinical Trials Register, and the Chinese Clinical Trial Register were also complementarily searched. Results: A total of 10 clinical studies were identified, including 3 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), 1 comparative nonrandomized trial, 5 single-arm trials, and 1 interim analysis. The heterogeneity among studies of the baseline disease severity and reported endpoints made a pooled analysis impossible. CQ and HCQ (with or without azithromycin) showed significant therapeutic benefit in terms of virologic clearance rate, improvement in symptoms and imaging findings, time to clinical recovery, and length of hospital stay in 1 RCT, 4 single-arm trials, and the interim analysis, whereas no treatment benefit of CQ or HCQ was observed in the remaining 4 studies. Limitations of the included studies ranged from small sample size, to insufficient information concerning baseline patient characteristics, to potential for selection bias without detailing the rationale for exclusion, and presence of confounding factors. Conclusion: Based on the studies evaluated, there still lacked solid evidence supporting the efficacy and safety of HCQ and CQ as a treatment for COVID-19 with or without azithromycin.

The sudden draconian measures changed the delivery of dental education and practice throughout the country. The study aimed to screen for depression during the COVID-19 lockdown and the factors associated with it among dental students and practitioners in highly COVID-19 infected states of India. Materials and Methods The current study is an online cross-sectional survey performed in Delhi NCR, Maharashtra, and Tamil Nadu during May 2020. The participants were recruited by convenience sampling. The main outcome measure was the screening of depression using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), which was categorized as mild, moderate, and severe depression. The data analysis was performed with IBM SPSS Version 23.0. A multivariable logistic regression model was fitted to identify the independent predictors of depression. Results In total, 335 dental students and practitioners participated in the survey. Among this, a significant number of the dental students (54%) and practitioners (44%) scored moderate to severe depression in terms of depression severity according to the PHQ-9 scores. Those who were screened depressed were likely to be males and younger than 30 years old. The results of correlation analysis indicated that worry about the professional growth, concerns regarding setbacks in clinical and research experiences, previous history of mental health issues, and fear of contracting COVID-19 from patients were positively related to higher depression scores in students. Moreover, for practitioners, fear of contracting COVID-19 from the patients scored higher levels of depression. The practitioners who reported less concern about their practice/job post COVID-19 lockdown and those who were able to meet their financial expenses during the lockdown were the least likely to be depressed. Conclusion The results of this study indicate a high level of depression among a significant number of dental students and practitioners. It is important to monitor and address the mental health needs of dental students and practitioners during and after the lockdown.","Chakraborty, Trishnika; Subbiah, Gireesh Kumar; Damade, Yogesh",Eur J Dent,99,1

Non-structural protein 3 (nsp3) is the largest nsp in the coronavirus genome, and it contains multiple functional domains that are required for coronavirus replication. Despite the numerous functional studies on MHV and its nsp3 domain, the structure of only one domain in nsp3, the small ubiquitin-like domain 1 (Ubl1), has been determined. We report here the x-ray structure of three tandemly linked domains of MHV nsp3, including the papain-like protease 2 (PLP2) catalytic domain, the ubiquitin-like domain 2 (Ubl2), and a third domain that we call the DPUP (domain preceding Ubl2 and PLP2) domain. DPUP has close structural similarity to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus unique domain C (SUD-C), suggesting that this domain may not be unique to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. The PLP2 catalytic domain was found to have both deubiquitinating and deISGylating isopeptidase activities in addition to proteolytic activity. A computationally derived model of MHV PLP2 bound to ubiquitin was generated, and the potential interactions between ubiquitin and PLP2 were probed by site-directed mutagenesis. These studies extend substantially our structural knowledge of MHV nsp3, providing a platform for further investigation of the role of nsp3 domains in MHV viral replication.","Chen, Yafang; Savinov, Sergey N.; Mielech, Anna M.; Cao, Thu; Baker, Susan C.; Mesecar, Andrew D.",J Biol Chem,99,6

The purpose of the study is to evaluate the impact of the economic crisis on the moment of a breast cancer diagnosis. This retrospective observational study analyzed a cohort of 4929 patients diagnosed with breast cancer over the course of 19 years in the Western region of Romania. The time interval was divided based on the onset of the economic crisis into 3 periods: pre-crisis (2001–2006), crisis (2007–2012), and post-crisis (2013–2019). The disease stage at the moment of diagnosis was considered either early (stages 0, I, II) or advanced (stages III, IV). Although recording a similar mean number of patients diagnosed per year during the pre- and crisis periods, a significantly higher percentage of patients were diagnosed with late-stage breast cancer during the economic crisis period compared to the previous interval (46.9% vs. 56.3%, p < 0.01). This difference was further accentuated when accounting for environmental setting, with 65.2% of patients from a rural setting being diagnosed with advanced disease during the crisis interval. An overall improvement of 12% in early-stage breast cancer diagnosis was recorded in the post-crisis period (55.7%, p < 0.001). The findings of this study support periods of economic instability as potential factors for a delay in breast cancer diagnosis and highlight the need for the development of specific strategies aimed at reducing cancer healthcare and associated financial burden in times of economic crisis.","Petrovici, Iasmina; Ionica, Mihaela; Neagoe, Octavian C.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,99,1

The alignment-free methods are popular nowadays, whereas the manual intervention in those methods usually decreases the accuracy. Also, the interactions among nucleotides are neglected in most methods. Here we propose a new Accumulated Natural Vector (ANV) method which represents each DNA sequence by a point in ℝ(18). By calculating the Accumulated Indicator Functions of nucleotides, we can further find an Accumulated Natural Vector for each sequence. This new Accumulated Natural Vector not only can capture the distribution of each nucleotide, but also provide the covariance among nucleotides. Thus global comparison of DNA sequences or genomes can be done easily in ℝ(18). The tests of ANV of datasets of different sizes and types have proved the accuracy and time-efficiency of the new proposed ANV method.","Dong, Rui; He, Lily; He, Rong Lucy; Yau, Stephen S.-T.",Front Genet,99,21

The subjects of this research were in-school youths and school drop-outs who joined the three waves of “Social-Up Youth Entrepreneurship Programme” including social entrepreneurship training (T1), internship (T2), and a pre-incubation project funded by a Charities Trust in Hong Kong. This research included a quantitative part, that is, questionnaires, and qualitative part, that is, focus group and individual interviews. At the time of data analysis, 100 disadvantaged young people joined the program at the baseline measure (T0). Only 77 and 31 could be matched and sufficient enough for data analysis at T1 and T2, respectively. The results demonstrated that social entrepreneurship training is positive and promising to enhance disadvantaged young peoples’ sense of self-worth and resilience, their entrepreneurial knowledge and skills, and overall self-perceived employability. The impact of the interactive and experiential-oriented social entrepreneurship training was the most significant. The impact of the internship was influenced by the extra burdens added to in-school youths. Because of its potential positive effects, further examination is required. Young people were found to have weak proactivity and flexibility in work, thinking, and interpersonal and communication skills, and the early introduction of curriculum-based youth entrepreneurship training in secondary schools is highly recommended.","Tam, Hau-Lin; Asamoah, Edward; Chan, Angus Yuk-Fung",Appl Res Qual Life,99,1

Based on satellite observations of atmospheric gases from Sentinel-5, results indicate significant reductions in the levels of atmospheric pollutants, particularly nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and carbon monoxide (CO). Air quality improved significantly during the middle phases of the lockdown (April and May), especially in small metropolitan cities like Amman, Beirut, and Jeddah, while it was less significant in ""mega"" cities like Cairo, Tehran, and Istanbul. For example, the concentrations of NO2 in Amman, Beirut, and Jeddah decreased by -56.6%, -43.4%, and -32.3%, respectively, during April 2020, compared to April 2019. Rather, there was a small decrease in NO2 levels in megacities like Tehran (-0.9%) and Cairo (-3.1%). Notably, during the lockdown period, there was a decrease in the mean intensity of nighttime SUHI, while the mean intensity of daytime SUHI experienced either an increase or a slight decrease across these locations. Together with the Gulf metropolitans (e.g. Kuwait, Dubai, and Muscat), the megacities (e.g. Tehran, Ankara, and Istanbul) exhibited anomalous increases in the intensity of daytime SUHI, which may exceed 2 °C. Statistical relationships were established to explore the association between changes in the mean intensity and the hotspot area in each metropolitan location during the lockdown. The findings indicate that the mean intensity of SUHI and the spatial extension of hotspot areas within each metropolitan had a statistically significant negative relationship, with Pearson's r values generally exceeding - 0.55, especially for daytime SUHI. This negative dependency was evident for both daytime and nighttime SUHI during all months of the lockdown. Our findings demonstrate that the decrease in primary pollutant levels during the lockdown contributed to the decrease in the intensity of nighttime SUHIs in the Middle East, especially in April and May. Changes in the characteristics of SUHIs during the lockdown period should be interpreted in the context of long-term climate change, rather than just the consequence of restrictive measures. This is simply because short-term air quality improvements were insufficient to generate meaningful changes in the region's urban climate.","El Kenawy, Ahmed M; Lopez-Moreno, Juan I; McCabe, Matthew F; Domínguez-Castro, Fernando; Peña-Angulo, Dhais; Gaber, Islam M; Alqasemi, Abduldaem S; Al Kindi, Khalifa M; Al-Awadhi, Talal; Hereher, Mohammed E; Robaa, Sayed M; Al Nasiri, Noura; Vicente-Serrano, Sergio M",Environmental pollution,99,1

Mutational analysis of the 106-amino acid cytoplasmic tail of p63 revealed that the NH2-terminal 23 amino acids are necessary for retention. When p63 was solubilized with Triton X-100 and subjected to centrifugation at 100,000 g, it formed large, insoluble oligomers, particularly at neutral pH and below. A comparison of the behavior of wildtype and mutant p63 proteins in this assay revealed a perfect correlation between the formation of large oligomers and correct intracellular retention.

As media coverage of pandemic using frightening language has been speculated to induce emotional disturbances in people and fluctuations in their resilience level, this study was performed to explore the effect of COVID-19 related news on individual's emotions and resilience. It was hypothesized that altering the type of news would produce varying levels of emotions and resilience in participants. Both the recruitment of participants and the conduction of the study were done online in September when the pandemic hit the peak in India. Randomly assigned participants were exposed to three conditions: positive news (N = 56), negative news (N = 59), and neutral news (N = 60) related to COVID-19. Analyses revealed negative news significantly decreased positive emotions and resilience while positive news significantly reduced negative emotions and vice-versa. These finding suggest strong impact of mass media on individual's emotions and their own self-evaluation on resilience. The study highlights the responsibility of mass media and urges for bringing necessary changes in covering pandemic news and similar other uncertain situations in keeping people's emotions stable and increasing their psychological resilience.","Giri, Shakshi Priya; Maurya, Abhishek Kumar",Pers Individ Dif,99,24

DESTINATION (NCT03706079) is a long-term extension (LTE) of these studies. METHODS: DESTINATION is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled LTE study in adults (18–80 years old) and adolescents (12–17 years old) with severe, uncontrolled asthma who are receiving treatment with medium- or high-dose inhaled corticosteroids plus at least one additional controller medication with or without oral corticosteroids. The study population will comprise patients who complete the 52- and 48-week NAVIGATOR and SOURCE studies, respectively. Patients who were randomized to receive tezepelumab 210 mg every 4 weeks (Q4W) in either predecessor study will continue to receive this regimen for 1 year; those who were previously randomized to receive placebo will be re-randomized (1:1) to receive either tezepelumab 210 mg Q4W or placebo for 1 year. Patients will receive their prescribed controller medications throughout DESTINATION and study physicians will have the opportunity to down- or up-titrate dosage of these medications, if appropriate. The primary objective is to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of tezepelumab over 104 weeks (inclusive of the treatment period of either predecessor study). The secondary objective is to assess the long-term effect of tezepelumab on asthma exacerbations. Patients recruited from SOURCE will be followed up post-treatment for 12 weeks. Patients recruited from NAVIGATOR who complete 100 weeks of tezepelumab treatment will be eligible for either 12 weeks of follow-up or a 36-week extended follow-up during which the clinical benefit of tezepelumab after treatment cessation will be investigated. DISCUSSION: DESTINATION will evaluate the long-term safety, tolerability and efficacy of tezepelumab versus placebo with continued dosing for up to 2 years.

Demographic data, ECMO characteristics and clinical outcomes were collected. The primary outcome was to assess the complication rate and 28-day mortality; the secondary outcome was to compare patient and ECMO characteristics between COVID-19 patients on ECMO and non-COVID-19 related ARDS patients on ECMO (non-COVID-19; January 1, 2018 until July 31, 2019). RESULTS: During the study period 71 COVID-19 patients received ECMO, mostly veno-venous, for a median duration of 13 days (IQR 7-20). ECMO was initiated at 5 days (IQR 3-10) following invasive mechanical ventilation. Median PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio prior to initiation of ECMO was similar in COVID-19 patients (58 mmHg [IQR 46-76]) and non-COVID-19 patients (53 mmHg [IQR 44-66]), the latter consisting of 48 patients. 28-day mortality was 37% in COVID-19 patients and 27% in non-COVID-19 patients. However, Kaplan-Meier curves showed that after a 100-day follow-up this non-significant difference resolves. Non-surviving COVID-19 patients were more acidotic prior to initiation ECMO, had a shorter ECMO run and fewer received muscle paralysis compared to survivors. CONCLUSIONS: No significant differences in outcomes were found between COVID-19 patients on ECMO and non-COVID-19 ARDS patients on ECMO. This suggests that ECMO could be considered as a supportive therapy in case of refractory respiratory failure in COVID-19.","Raasveld, Senta Jorinde; Delnoij, Thijs S.

We applied mixed-effect regression to investigate the factors that dictate PM variability (i.e., dust and meteorological covariates), and also processed satellite-based aerosol optical depths (AOD) to determine the spatial variability in aerosol loads. The results showed low PM2.5 concentration during the lockdown (33 μg/m3) compared to the corresponding previous three years (2017–2019); however, the PM10 concentration (122.5 μg/m3) increased relative to 2017 (116.6 μg/m3), and 2019 (92.8 μg/m3). After removing the ‘dust effects’, both PM2.5 and PM10 levels dropped by 18% and 31%, respectively. The mixed-effect regression model showed that high temperature and high wind speed were the main contributors to high PM2.5 and PM10, respectively, in addition to the dust haze and blowing dust.

Methods: Using a mathematical model we investigate the impact of interruption to MDA in trachoma-endemic settings. We evaluate potential measures to mitigate this impact and consider alternative strategies for accelerating progress in those areas where the trachoma elimination targets may not be achievable otherwise. Results: We demonstrate that for districts which were hyperendemic at baseline, or where the trachoma elimination thresholds have not already been achieved after 3 rounds of MDA, the interruption to planned MDA could lead to a delay greater than the duration of interruption. We also show that an additional round of MDA in the year following MDA resumption could effectively mitigate this delay. For districts where probability of elimination under annual MDA was already very low, we demonstrate that more intensive MDA schedules are needed to achieve agreed targets. Conclusion: Through appropriate use of additional MDA, the impact of COVID-19 in terms of delay to reaching trachoma elimination targets can be effectively mitigated. Additionally, more frequent MDA may accelerate progress towards 2030 goals.","Borlase, A.; Blumberg, S.; Callahan, E. K.; Deiner, M. S.; Nash, S. D.; Porco, T. C.; Solomon, A. W.; Lietman, T.

The RVA virion is a triple-layered particle, and the outermost layer consists of the glycoprotein VP7 and spike protein VP4. To increase the infectivity of RVA, VP4 is proteolytically cleaved into VP5* and VP8* subunits by trypsin; these subunits form a rigid spike structure on the virion surface. In this study, we investigated the growth of RVAs in cells transduced with type II transmembrane serine proteases (TTSPs), which cleave fusion proteins and promote infection by respiratory viruses, such as influenza viruses, paramyxoviruses, and coronaviruses. We identified TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS11D as host TTSPs that mediate trypsin-independent and multicycle infection by human and animal RVA strains. In vitro cleavage assays revealed that recombinant TMPRSS11D cleaved RVA VP4. We also found that TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS11D promote the infectious entry of immature RVA virions, but they could not activate nascent progeny virions in the late phase of infection. This observation differed from the TTSP-mediated activation process of paramyxoviruses, revealing the existence of virus species-specific activation processes in TTSPs. Our study provides new insights into the interaction between RVAs and host factors, and TTSP-transduced cells offer potential advantages for RVA research and development. IMPORTANCE Proteolytic cleavage of the viral VP4 protein is essential for virion maturation and infectivity in group A rotaviruses (RVAs). In cell culture, RVAs are propagated in culture medium supplemented with the exogenous protease trypsin, which cleaves VP4 and induces the maturation of progeny RVA virions. In this study, we demonstrated that the host proteases TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS11D mediate the trypsin-independent infection and growth of RVAs. Our data revealed that the proteolytic activation of RVAs by TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS11D occurs at the viral entry step. Because TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS11D gene expression induced similar or higher levels of RVA growth as trypsin-supplemented culture, this approach offers potential advantages for RVA research and development.","Sasaki, Michihito; Itakura, Yukari; Kishimoto, Mai; Tabata, Koshiro; Uemura, Kentaro; Ito, Naoto; Sugiyama, Makoto; Wastika, Christida E.; Orba, Yasuko; Sawa, Hirofumi",J Virol,99,23

In healthy adult cats, monocytes have been shown to constitutively transcribe pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. However, in order to characterize the effect of age, feline monocyte functions were examined for changes in cytokine transcription levels in early stages of immunosenescence. For this purpose, isolated, short-term cultured monocytes from barrier-maintained adult cats of different ages (15 mo to 10 yr) were examined for transcription of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12 p40 and TNF-α by real-time PCR. Transcription levels of cytokines varied and were generally highest for IL-1β. For IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-12 p40, both young and old cats exhibited highest levels. The age association was significant. TNF-α appeared to be transcribed at similar levels over the examination period, whereas IL-10 tended to decline with age but without any statistical significant differences. The observed age association of the constitutive transcription of some cytokines indicates a drop in monocyte activities from youth to middle age, which is then followed by a (progressive) increase with increasing age. This provides evidence that monocytes are in part responsible for the pro-inflammatory status observed with ageing.","Kipar, A.; Baptiste, K.; Meli, M.L.; Barth, A.; Knietsch, M.; Reinacher, M.; Lutz, H.",Exp Gerontol,99,22

Based on this assumption, we identified a set of 13 approved or clinically investigational drugs with positively charged guanidinobenzoyl and/or aminidinobenzoyl groups, including the experimentally verified TMPRSS2 inhibitors Camostat and Nafamostat. Molecular docking using the C-I-TASSER-predicted TMPRSS2 catalytic domain model suggested that the guanidinobenzoyl or aminidinobenzoyl group in all the drugs could form putative salt bridge interactions with the side-chain carboxyl group of Asp435 located in the S1 pocket of TMPRSS2. Molecular dynamics simulations further revealed the high stability of the putative salt bridge interactions over long-time (100 ns) simulations. The molecular mechanics/generalized Born surface area-binding free energy assessment and per-residue energy decomposition analysis also supported the strong binding interactions between TMPRSS2 and the proposed drugs. These results suggest that the proposed compounds, in addition to Camostat and Nafamostat, could be effective TMPRSS2 inhibitors for COVID-19 treatment by occupying the S1 pocket with the hallmark positively charged groups.","Huang, Xiaoqiang; Pearce, Robin; Omenn, Gilbert S.; Zhang, Yang",Int J Mol Sci,99,1

However, in vulnerable populations, such as newborns, infants, the elderly and immune-compromised individuals, these opportunistic pathogens can also affect the lower respiratory tract, causing a more severe disease (e.g., pneumonia). Respiratory viruses can also exacerbate asthma and lead to various types of respiratory distress syndromes. Furthermore, as they can adapt fast and cross the species barrier, some of these pathogens, like influenza A and SARS-CoV, have occasionally caused epidemics or pandemics, and were associated with more serious clinical diseases and even mortality. For a few decades now, data reported in the scientific literature has also demonstrated that several respiratory viruses have neuroinvasive capacities, since they can spread from the respiratory tract to the central nervous system (CNS). Viruses infecting human CNS cells could then cause different types of encephalopathy, including encephalitis, and long-term neurological diseases. Like other well-recognized neuroinvasive human viruses, respiratory viruses may damage the CNS as a result of misdirected host immune responses that could be associated with autoimmunity in susceptible individuals (virus-induced neuro-immunopathology) and/or viral replication, which directly causes damage to CNS cells (virus-induced neuropathology). The etiological agent of several neurological disorders remains unidentified. Opportunistic human respiratory pathogens could be associated with the triggering or the exacerbation of these disorders whose etiology remains poorly understood. Herein, we present a global portrait of some of the most prevalent or emerging human respiratory viruses that have been associated with possible pathogenic processes in CNS infection, with a special emphasis on human coronaviruses.","Desforges, Marc; Le Coupanec, Alain; Dubeau, Philippe; Bourgouin, Andréanne; Lajoie, Louise; Dubé, Mathieu; Talbot, Pierre J.",Viruses,99,22

There have now been an estimated 2 580 000 infections and more than 170 000 fatal cases around the world. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that approximately 14% of infections developed into severe disease, 5% were critically ill, and the mortality rate of critically ill patients is reported to be over 50%. The shortage of specific anti-viral treatment and vaccines remains a huge challenge. In COVID-19, refractory hypoxemia is common among the critically ill with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) despite invasive mechanical ventilation, and is further complicated by respiratory and circulatory failure. This difficult situation calls for the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) for assisting respiration and circulation if necessary.

OBJECTIVE: The goal of this project was to reduce the number of inappropriate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) requests for LBP patients and facilitate appropriate imaging by developing a combined imaging appropriateness checklist for lumbar spine MRI and CT. METHODS: In prior work, we developed and adopted individual evidence-based lumbar spine MRI and CT checklists into the radiology requisition process. In the current project, a combined checklist was developed and trialed in one of the former Saskatchewan health regions (Five Hills) beginning in May 2018. Using statistical process control, control charts compared the monthly number of imaging requests pre-checklist implementation and post-checklist implementation from May 2017 to February 2020. The monthly number of lumbar spine MRI and CT requisitions in the nearby former Saskatchewan Regina Qu’Appelle Health Region, in which the combined checklist was not trialed, was also plotted and compared as a balancing measure. RESULTS: In Five Hills, a shift (decrease) was observed in the monthly number of lumbar spine MRI requisitions 7 months following the implementation of the combined checklist. However, the monthly number of lumbar spine CT requisitions did not change significantly. In the Regina Qu’Appelle Health Region, there was a shift (increase) in the monthly number of lumbar spine MRI requisitions, while the monthly number of lumbar spine CT requests decreased after the implementation of the combined checklist. CONCLUSIONS: The combined checklist with evidence-based indications for lumbar spine MRI and CT imaging in LBP patients appeared to reduce the complexity associated with two previous individual checklists and facilitate imaging appropriateness. Accountable benefits may include the reduction of radiation exposure as a result of unnecessary and repeated imaging and reduction in wait times for CT and/or MRI.","Madani larijani, Maryam; Azizian, Amir; Carr, Tracey; Adams, Scott j; Groot, Gary",Int J Qual Health Care,99,16

Currently, there is no vaccine available for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection. Like closely related severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), SARS-CoV-2 also uses its receptor-binding domain (RBD) on the spike (S) protein to engage the host receptor, human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), facilitating subsequent viral entry. Here we report the immunogenicity and vaccine potential of SARS-CoV-2 RBD (SARS2-RBD)-based recombinant proteins. Immunization with SARS2-RBD recombinant proteins potently induced a multi-functional antibody response in mice. The resulting antisera could efficiently block the interaction between SARS2-RBD and ACE2, inhibit S-mediated cell-cell fusion, and neutralize both SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus entry and authentic SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, the anti-RBD sera also exhibited cross binding, ACE2-blockade, and neutralization effects towards SARS-CoV. More importantly, we found that the anti-RBD sera did not promote antibody-dependent enhancement of either SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus entry or authentic virus infection of Fc receptor-bearing cells.

Pre-existing disparities in healthcare may be intersecting with COVID-19 outcomes. OBJECTIVES: To explore the relationship between county-level race/ethnic composition and COVID-19 mortality in the state of Texas and determine whether county-level health factors, healthcare access measures, and other demographic characteristics explain this relationship. METHODS: This retrospective study uses county-level case and fatality data obtained from the Texas Department of State Health Services and merged with the 2020 Robert Wood Johnson foundation (RWJF) county health rankings data. The outcome variables were fatalities per 100,000 population. A two-part/hurdle model examined (1) the probability of having a COVID-19 fatality and (2) fatalities per 100,000 population in counties with 1+ fatalities. For both parts of the hurdle model, we examined the impacts of racial and ethnic composition, adjusting for county characteristics and health factors. RESULTS: The odds of having a COVID-19 fatality decreased with a unit increase in the rate of primary care physicians in a county (OR = 0.93; 95% CI = 0.89, 0.99). In the second part of the model, there was a statistically significant increase in COVID-19 fatalities/100,000 population with every 1 % increase in the proportion of Hispanics (β = 5.41; p = 0.03) and African Americans (β = 5.08; p value = 0.04).

Brief exposure therapy provided early after trauma has shown encouraging results in promoting recovery. To scale up treatment availability, we developed a 3-week internet-delivered intervention comprised of four modules based on prolonged exposure (condensed internet-delivered prolonged exposure; CIPE) with therapist support. In this pilot study, we assessed the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of CIPE delivered within 2 months after the index event. Thirty-three participants were randomised to CIPE or a waiting list (WL). The frequency, vividness and distress of intrusive recollections or flashback memories of the traumatic event were assessed using an intrusive memory smartphone app. Symptoms of post-traumatic stress were assessed by the PTSD Symptom Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5). The most common index traumas in the sample were rape, interpersonal violence and life-threatening accidents. A majority of participants (82%) randomised to CIPE completed all modules, and the number of logins per participant to the Internet platform was high during the three-week intervention (M = 19.6, SD = 11.8). At post-treatment, the CIPE participants had a more favourable reduction than the WL group on the vividness and distress ratings, as well as on the PCL-5 sum score (bootstrapped d = 0.85; 95% CI [0.25–1.45]).

When NA cells pretreated with rAAV-N796 were challenged with RABV, there was a 37.8 ± 3.4% to 55.1 ± 5.3% reduction in RABV virus titer. When cells pre-challenged with RABV were treated with rAAV-N796, there was a 4.4 ± 1.4 to 28.8 ± 3.2% reduction in RABV virus titer. Relative quantification of RABV transcripts using real-time PCR and Western blot revealed that the knockdown of RABV-N gene transcripts was based on the rAAV-N796 inoculation titer. When any NA cells were treated with rAAV-N796 before or after challenged with RABV, significant reduction in virus titer was observed in both administrations. Mice treated intracerebrally with rAAV-N796 exhibited 50 ± 5.3 and 62.5 ± 4.7% protection when challenged intracerebrally or intramuscally, respectively, with lethal RABV.

Fractional order respiratory impedance models can be indicative of lung cancer dynamics and tissue heterogeneity. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to investigate how the existence of a tumorous tissue in the lung modifies the parameters of the proposed models. The first use of a prototype forced oscillations technique (FOT) device in a mimicked lung tumor setup is investigated by comparing and interpreting the experimental findings. METHODS: The fractional order model parameters are determined for the mechanical properties of the healthy and tumorous lung. Two protocols have been performed for a mimicked lung tumor setup in a laboratory environment. A low frequency evaluation of respiratory impedance model and nonlinearity index were assessed using the forced oscillations technique. RESULTS: The viscoelastic properties of the lung tissue change, results being mirrored in the respiratory impedance assessment via FOT. The results demonstrate significant differences among the mimicked healthy and tumor measurements, (p-values [Formula: see text] 0.05) for impedance values and also for heterogeneity index. However, there was no significant difference in lung function before and after immersing the mimicked lung in water or saline solution, denoting no structural changes. CONCLUSION: Simulation tests comparing the changes in impedance support the research hypothesis. The impedance frequency response is effective in non-invasive identification of respiratory tissue abnormalities in tumorous lung, analyzed with appropriate fractional models.","Ghita, Maria; Copot, Dana; Ionescu, Clara M.",J Adv Res,99,1

This study is aimed at finding out the suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in Hubei province, China. We also investigated symptoms, medications, life quality, and psychological issues of IBD patients under the ongoing pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a self-reported questionnaire survey via an online survey platform. SARS-CoV-2 infection-related data was collected from IBD patients. The status quo of medications and symptoms of the subjects were investigated. Life quality, depression, and anxiety were measured by clinical questionnaires and rated on scoring systems. RESULTS: A total of 204 IBD patients from Hubei province were included in this study. No suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection case was found in this study. As a result of city shutdown, two-thirds of the patients (138/204) in our series reported difficulty in accessing medicines and nearly half of them (73/138) had to discontinue medications. Apart from gastrointestinal symptoms, systemic symptoms were common while respiratory symptoms were rare in the cohort. Though their quality of life was not significantly lowered, depression and anxiety were problems that seriously affected them during the COVID-19 epidemic. CONCLUSIONS: Inaccessibility to medications is a serious problem for IBD patients after city shutdown. Efforts have to be made to address the problems of drug withdrawal and psychological issues that IBD patients suffer from during the COVID-19 outbreak.","Wang, Huan; Tu, Lei; Li, Ying; Bai, Tao; Zou, Kaifang; Xiao, Fang; Li, Jin; Chen, Min; Zhang, Heng; Li, Gangqin; Lu, Yueyue; Wang, Kai; Jin, Shu; Yang, Yuanping; Zhu, Liangru; Hou, Xiaohua",J Immunol Res,99,7

A comprehensive risk pathway was generated to consider the likelihood of a SARS-CoV-2 contamination event at any of the relevant steps of the food processing and handling chain, and potential for exposure and transmission of the virus to the consumer. The scientific evidence was reviewed and assessed for each event in the pathway, taking into consideration relevant elements that could increase or mitigate the risk of contamination. The advantage of having an event-wise contextualization of the SARS-CoV-2 transmission pathway through the food chain, is that it provides a systematic and consistent approach to evaluate any new data and communicate its importance and impact. The pathway also increases the objectivity and consistency of the assessment in a rapidly evolving and high-stakes situation. Based on our review and analysis, there is currently no comprehensive epidemiological evidence of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2, or its variants, causing COVID-19 from transmission through food or food packaging. Considering the remote possibility of exposure through food, the likelihood of exposure by ingestion or contact with mucosa is considered negligible to very low and good hygiene practices during food preparation should continue to be followed.","Locas, Annie; Brassard, Julie; Rose-Martel, Megan; Lambert, Dominic; Green, Alyssa; Deckert, Anne; Illing, Michelle",J. foof prot,99,23

METHODS: Laboratory results and obstetrical outcomes of women with singleton gestations, admitted for delivery during the COVID-19 mask-wearing period (April-June 2020) were compared with those of women delivering during the parallel period in 2019 and with a larger cohort derived from nine pre-pandemic years (March 2011-April 2020). RESULTS: Overall, 1838 women delivered during the COVID-19 pandemic. Compared with the pre-pandemic period, mean hemoglobin and fibrinogen levels were significantly higher during the mask-wearing period (12.15 ± 1.1 vs 11.96 ± 1.2, P < 0.001 and 472 ± 103.6 vs 448 ± 85.1 mg/dl, P < 0.001, respectively). Platelet levels were lower (200 ± 56.0 vs 206 ± 57.5 K/µl, P < 0.001). The rate of delivery at <34 weeks of gestation was lower during the mask-wearing period (1.1% vs 2%, odds ratio [OR] 0.57, 95% confidence intervals [CI] 0.37-0.88, P = 0.01), whereas cesarean delivery and postpartum hemorrhage rates were higher (26.7% vs 24.4%, OR 1.13, 95% CI 1.02-1.25, P = 0.022 and 4.1% vs 2.8%, OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.2-1.8, P = 0.001, respectively).

Bernard Vallat, director general of the OIE, made the statement, “As a result of globalisation and climate change we are currently facing an unprecedented worldwide impact of emerging and re-emerging animal diseases and zoonoses”. He is not alone in this thinking, but are we facing an unprecedented impact of diseases and are globalisation and climate change the main driving forces? This paper examines some historical disease outbreaks and the factors that played a role in their emergence and compares these with recent emerging diseases. In doing so it highlights certain challenges that face livestock producers and decision makers today as they grapple with emerging diseases. One of the driving forces for the emergence of diseases is translocation of people and their livestock and this has often been coupled with invading armies or peoples, political unrest and a concurrent environment of socio-economic upheaval. Contact between wild animals, domestic animals and people is another driving force involving the interaction between naïve population groups that induces the emergence of new diseases. Pandemics are not new to human society and nor are many of the driving forces that caused them to occur in the past; what has changed is our increased knowledge and awareness of disease dynamics, allowing identification of challenges for the future and ways of addressing these. Modern farming practices often serve to amplify emerging infectious diseases and modern trade and transport mechanisms and routes have served to sometimes accelerate the spread of disease. How can we reduce the risks and should we only be worried about emerging infectious diseases or are emerging non-communicable diseases just as important in our modern society? This paper serves to explain some of the reasons for the emergence of diseases and to try and answer some of the pressing questions that confront livestock producers today.","Gummow, B.",Livest Sci,99,20

By systematically interrogating public genetic screening data, we comprehensively cataloged host dependency genes (HDGs) that are indispensable for successful viral infection corresponding to 10 families and 29 species of RNA viruses. We then utilized these HDGs as potential drug targets and interrogated extensive drug-target interactions through database retrieval, literature mining, and de novo prediction using artificial intelligence-based algorithms.

We aimed to assess the more recent nationwide seroprevalence in the general population in India. METHODS: We did a second household serosurvey among individuals aged 10 years or older in the same 700 villages or wards within 70 districts in India that were included in the first serosurvey. Individuals aged younger than 10 years and households that did not respond at the time of survey were excluded. Participants were interviewed to collect information on sociodemographics, symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, exposure history to laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases, and history of COVID-19 illness. 3–5 mL of venous blood was collected from each participant and blood samples were tested using the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay. Seroprevalence was estimated after applying the sampling weights and adjusting for clustering and assay characteristics. We randomly selected one adult serum sample from each household to compare the seroprevalence among adults between the two serosurveys. FINDINGS: Between Aug 18 and Sept 20, 2020, we enrolled and collected serum samples from 29 082 individuals from 15 613 households. The weighted and adjusted seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in individuals aged 10 years or older was 6·6% (95% CI 5·8–7·4). Among 15 084 randomly selected adults (one per household), the weighted and adjusted seroprevalence was 7·1% (6·2–8·2). Seroprevalence was similar across age groups, sexes, and occupations. Seroprevalence was highest in urban slum areas followed by urban non-slum and rural areas. We estimated a cumulative 74·3 million infections in the country by Aug 18, 2020, with 26–32 infections for every reported COVID-19 case. INTERPRETATION: Approximately one in 15 individuals aged 10 years or older in India had SARS-CoV-2 infection by Aug 18, 2020. The adult seroprevalence increased approximately tenfold between May and August, 2020. Lower infection-to-case ratio in August than in May reflects a substantial increase in testing across the country.

Optimal control theory is applied to a system of ordinary differential equations which is modeling Ebola infection through three different routes including contact between humans and a dead body. In an attempt to reduce infection in susceptible population, a preventive control is put in the form of education and campaign and two treatment controls are applied to infected and late-stage infected (super) human population. The Pontryagins maximum principle is employed to characterize optimality control, which is then solved numerically. It is observed that time optimal control is existed in the model. The activation of each control showed a positive reduction of infection. The overall effect of activation of all the controls simultaneously reduced the effort required for the reduction of the infection quickly. The obtained results present a good framework for planning and designing cost-effective strategies for good interventions in dealing with Ebola disease.

The pathogenetic core of critical situations, including COVID-19, is this phenomenon. Microcirculatory abnormalities, on the other hand, lie at the heart of a specific type of general pathological process known as systemic inflammation (SI). Systemic inflammatory response, cytokine release, cytokine storm, and thrombo-inflammatory syndrome are all terms that refer to different aspects of SI.

On March 14, 2020, at the beginning of the first epidemic wave of COVID-19 in France, a cluster was reported in a nursing home in the Nouvelle-Aquitaine region. We monitored the outbreak as well as the infection prevention and control (IPC) measures implemented. METHODS: A confirmed case was defined as laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in a resident or staff member present in the nursing home between March 7 and May 1, 2020; and a probable case as a person presenting an acute respiratory illness after contact with a confirmed case. Symptomatic inpatient residents and symptomatic staff members were systematically tested for SARS-CoV-2. In addition, two screening sessions were held on site. RESULTS: We identified 109 cases (98 confirmed, 11 probable). The attack rate was 66% among residents and 45% among staff. Half of all cases were identified during the screening sessions. One-quarter of cases had minor symptoms or were asymptomatic. The case fatality rate among residents was 29%. IPC measures were rapidly implemented such as the quarantine of residents, the reinforcement of staff personal protective equipment, and home quarantine of staff testing positive, which were supplemented in April by systematic controls at the entrance of the nursing home and the creation of additional staff break rooms. CONCLUSIONS: This outbreak confirmed the considerable health impact of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in a nursing home. In addition to the implementation of IPC measures, the early detection of cases through the screening of residents and staff is essential to identify asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic cases and limit the spread of the virus.","Bernadou, A.; Bouges, S.; Catroux, M.; Rigaux, J.

These workers and their dependents are in a socially vulnerable and economically difficult situation due to the dire impacts of the COVID-19. Migrant workers from Bangladesh in other countries are facing adverse impacts such as unemployment, short working hours, isolation, poor quality of living, social discrimination and mental pressure while their dependents at home are facing financial crisis due to the limited or reduced cash flow from their working relatives. A significant number of migrant workers have been sent back to Bangladesh and many are in constant fear of being sent back due to the impacts of COVID-19 in their host countries. Thus, COVID-19 intensifies numerous socio-economic crises such as joblessness, consumption of reserve funds by family members, and shrinking of the country’s remittance inflow. In this situation, the most urgent and important need is to give financial security and social safety to the workers abroad and those who have returned to Bangladesh. Apart from diplomatic endeavors to maintain the status quo of policy, the government of Bangladesh may take initiatives to provide financial support to these workers as a short-term strategy to overcome hardships during the pandemic and design a comprehensive plan with a detailed database of all migrant workers to create a need-based and skilled workforce as a long-term solution.

The task of vaccinating some 20 million people presents considerable logistic challenges, but a rapid rollout is essential to allow for the reopening of borders and is especially urgent as new more transmissible variants arise. Here, we run a series of projections to estimate how long it will take to vaccinate the Australian population under different assumptions about the rate of vaccine administration, the schedule for vaccine eligibility and prevalence of vaccine hesitancy. Our analysis highlights the number of vaccine doses that can be administered per day as the key factor determining the duration of the vaccine rollout. A rate of 200,000 doses per day would achieve 90% population coverage by the end of 2021; 80,000 doses a day would see the rollout extended until mid-2023. Vaccine hesitancy has the potential to greatly slow down the rollout and becomes the main limiting factor when the supply of vaccine doses is high. Speed is of the essence when it comes vaccinating populations against COVID-19: a rapid rollout will minimise the risk of sporadic and costly lockdowns and the potential for small, local clusters getting out of control and sparking new epidemic waves. In order to achieve rapid population coverage, the Australian government must ramp up vaccine administration to at least 200,000 doses per day as quickly as possible, while also promoting vaccine willingness in the community through clear public health messaging, especially to known hesitant demographics.","Hanly, Mark; Churches, Timothy; Fitzgerald, Oisín; MacIntyre, C.

We investigated the level of perceived risk and adherence to preventive behaviors regarding COVID-19 among medical students and physicians. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted an online nationwide cross-sectional survey among Iranian physicians and medical students. We collected data regarding perceived risk, perceived stress scale (P·S·S.), attitude, practice, and information sources. We assessed the association of four main outcomes (risk perception, P·S.S. score, attitude, and practice) with demographic variables. RESULTS: A total of 1085 participants with an overall fear score of 6.48 ± 2.29 out of 10 filled the questionnaires. Older and more educated participants had a higher risk perception level and adherence to protective measures. In contrary, participants in lower-risk workplaces had lower risk perception scores. Main sources of information did not affect the scores of risk perception, P·S·S., and practice. Higher risk perception scores were observed in those with higher practice and P·S.S. scores. Contrary to risk perception, the P·S.S. score was not affected by many of the demographic variables, except gender. The most positive attitude was observed in individuals with a higher level of trust in governmental information sources. Participants with higher P·S.S. scores adhered more to protective measures. CONCLUSION: Risk perception had the greatest impact on adherence to preventive behaviors. Therefore, policymakers should consider perceived risk as a predictor of the extension of the pandemic. Both risk perception and P·S.S. reflect the severity of fear from COVID-19; however, P·S.S. is less affected by sociodemographic and workplace characteristics.","Roshanshad, Romina; Roshanshad, Amirhossein; Molavi Vardanjani, Hossein; Mashhadiagha, Amirali; Mobarakabadi, Maryam; Hoveidaei, Armin; Hoveidaei, Amir Human",Ann Med Surg (Lond),99,26

But, there is still a lack of systematic review of registered clinical trials. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review of the clinical trials of COVID-19 to summarize the characteristics of the COVID-19 registered clinical trials. Methods: This study is based on the recommendations of the PRISMA in the Cochrane handbook. The databases from the Chinese Clinical Registration Center and the ClinicalTrials.gov were searched to collect the registered clinical trials of COVID-19. The retrieval inception date is February 9, 2020. Two researchers independently selected the literature based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, extracted data and evaluated the risk of bias. Results: A total of 75 registered clinical trials (63 interventional studies and 12 observational studies) of COVID-19 were obtained. A majority of clinical trials were sponsored by Chinese hospitals. Only 11 trials have begun to recruit patients, and none of the registered clinical trials had been completed; 34 trials were early clinical exploratory trials or in a pre-experiment stage, 15 trials belonged to phrase Ⅲ and 4 trials were phrase Ⅳ. The methods of intervention included traditional Chinese medicine involving 26 trials, Western medicine involving 30 trials, and integrated traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine involving 19 trials. The subjects were mainly non-critical adult patients (≥ 18 years old). The median sample size of the trials was 100 (IQR: 60 - 200), and the median execute time of the trials was 179 d (IQR: 94 - 366 d). The main outcomes were clinical observation and examinations. Overall, both the methodology quality of interventional trials and observational studies were low. Conclusions: Disorderly and intensive clinical trials of COVID-19 using traditional Chinese medicine and western medicine are ongoing or will being carried out in China. However, based on the low methodology quality and small sample size and long studies execute time, we will not be able to obtain reliable, high-quality clinical evidence about COVID-19 treatment in the near future. Improving the quality of study design, prioritizing promising drugs, and using different designs and statistical methods are worth advocating and recommending for the clinical trials of COVID-19 in China.","Zhu, Rui-fang; Gao, Ru-lu; Robert, Sue-Ho; Gao, Jin-ping; Yang, Shi-gui; Zhu, Changtai",,99,23

Reactions toward older adults included a mix of prosocial behaviors and ageist responses, consistent with the history of positive and negative views and treatment of older adults in the United States. METHODS: In a two-part study (n = 113, M(age) = 18.49, SD = 0.50; range 18–19), we examined whether pre-pandemic ageism among undergraduates predicts prosocial behavioral intentions toward older adults both specific to COVID-19 and in general. RESULTS: Pre-pandemic ageism toward older adults predicted less intentions to help older adults generally and specific to COVID-19. Whereas viewing older adults as incompetent predicted greater intentions to help specific to COVID-19. DISCUSSION: These results reflect the complexity of predicting helping behaviors and suggest that even supportive behaviors toward older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic may be rooted in negative ageist stereotypes.

Our biggest challenge in treating CDI is preventing recurrence, which is seen in approximately 25% of patients with initial infection and in 40–60% of those with subsequent episodes. Given the major disease burden of this infection, appropriate data-driven treatment remains essential. Clinical treatment guidelines provide an unbiased critical analysis of the literature, integrating the quality of the available data to make recommendations. As CDI has been evolving and more research has become available, the frequency of guideline issue from various global societies has increased, as has the detail of the recommendations to fit more relevant clinical scenarios. In this review, we will discuss clinical guideline recommendations over three time periods: The Initial Guidelines 1995–1997, The Second Wave 2009–2013, and The Modern Era 2014–present. We see the changing recommendations from metronidazole or vancomycin for initial infection during earlier times to preferential treatment with fidaxomicin within the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and Society of Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA) joint guidelines provisional update in late 2020. The recommended treatments for first recurrence were initially with the same antimicrobial as the first episode but have since changed to having multiple options for one or more recurrences. We have also seen the addition of immune boosting treatments, including fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT)/microbiota restoration therapy (MRT) and bezlotoxumab in the more modern recommendations. As the guidelines are evolving with the times, it remains important to understand the differences among them so we can apply this information clinically and optimize patient outcomes.","Chaar, Abdelkader; Feuerstadt, Paul",Therap Adv Gastroenterol,99,30

We analyzed the response of 1149 respondents across Saudi Arabia. We found that 97% of the participants were aware of MERS. In addition, 72% realized that coughing and sneezing could spread the infection. Furthermore, 83% thought that some patients with MERS could be cured. Moreover, 62% knew that no vaccine can prevent the disease.

The following CT findings were investigated: the presence of abscess wall, rim enhancement, edge characteristic, septa, intermediate density zone, and peripheral hypodensity. Abscesses from each type were further evaluated for their clinical presentations, laboratory findings and outcomes. RESULTS: We identified three types of ALAs: type I, II and III. Type I abscesses (66%) were characterized by absent or incomplete walls, ragged edges and peripheral septa; their edges exhibited irregular and interrupted enhancement. Type II (28%) had a complete wall characterized by rim enhancement and peripheral hypodense halo. Type III (6%) demonstrated a wall but without enhancement. Clinically, type I abscesses presented acutely with severe disease. They had significantly deranged laboratory parameters, higher incidence of rupture and higher rate of inpatient or intensive care unit admission. The severity of the disease prompted immediate percutaneous drainage in most type I abscesses (81%). Two of them died from multiple organ failure. The type II or III abscesses, on the other hand, had delayed presentations with mild to moderate disease, with near normal laboratory findings. CONCLUSION: ALAs have three different CT morphological types, with different clinical and laboratory features. Percutaneous drainage is indicated in most of type I abscesses.","Priyadarshi, Rajeev Nayan; Sherin, Lisna; Kumar, Ramesh; Anand, Utpal; Kumar, Prem",Abdom Radiol (NY),99,23

Strains of this lineage were first identified in Israel in 1998. More severe form of the virus appeared in 2006, when the second wave of Var2 epidemic has spread over the Middle East region. The present study describes the detection and detailed genetic characterization of the GI-23 viruses in Poland. The full-length genome of gammaCoV/Ck/Poland/G052/2016 strain consists of 27596 nucleotides and has typical organization for IBV (UTR5′-POl-S-3a-3b-E-M-4b-4c-5a-5b-N-UTR3′). The phylogenetic analysis of the complete sequence showed that it formed separate branch distinct from all of the full-length genome sequences analyzed in this study. Recombination analyses with other gammacoronaviruses revealed that Polish GI-23 strain may originate from recombination events and potential donors of build-in sequences are IBV of GI-1, GI-13 and G-19 lineages (Mass-, 793B- and QX-like strains, respectively). The 1a, 1b and N genes were involved in these recombination events.

This article reports on contingency planning initiative in the Australian public sector. METHODS: Ninety-word care synopses were developed for each patient. These formed the basis for guided conversations between case managers and consultant psychiatrists to ensure safe service provision and retain a person-centred focus amidst the threat of major staffing shortfalls. RESULTS: This process identified vulnerable patient groups with specific communication needs and those most at risk through service contraction. The challenges and opportunities for promoting safety and self-management through proactive telehealth came up repeatedly. The guided conversations also raised awareness of the shared experience between patients and professionals of coronavirus disease 2019.

La COVID-19 est la maladie infectieuse émergente due au SRAS-CoV-2, principalement associée à une infection des voies respiratoires inférieures. Une connaissance approfondie des caractéristiques cliniques des patients COVID-19 symptomatiques lors de leur admission hospitalière est cruciale pour optimiser leur prise en charge dans ce contexte pandémique. L’objectif principal de l’étude était de décrire les caractéristiques cliniques des patients COVID-19 à l’admission et d’identifier les déterminants associés à l’admission directe ou au transfert dans les unités de soins intensifs (USI) des différents hôpitaux participants. Matériels et méthodes Cette étude est un projet ancillaire du projet NOSO-COR, une étude prospective, observationnelle, en milieu hospitalier, dont l’objectif principal est d’estimer le risque de la COVID-19 nosocomiale. Les caractéristiques démographiques, les comorbidités sous-jacentes, ainsi que les paramètres cliniques et biologiques ont été collectés. Les patients ont été suivis jusqu’à la sortie de l’hôpital ou le décès. Les comparaisons entre les groupes ont été effectuées en utilisant le test de Mann–Whitney ou Kruskall–Wallis et le test du Chi2 ou exact de Fisher, le cas échéant. Un modèle de régression multivariée a été appliquée à 374 patients pour lesquels la durée de séjour d’hospitalisation était complète et sans données manquantes. Résultats Sur les 412 patients inclus, 325 (78,9 %) sont sortis vivants de l’hôpital et 87 sont décédés à l’hôpital au moment de l’analyse. L’âge médian était de 72,0 ans [IQR : 57–83] et 56,3 % étaient des hommes. Au total, 286 patients (69,4 %) avaient un ou plusieurs comorbidités dont les plus fréquents étaient les maladies cardiovasculaires (47,6 %) et le diabètes (19,9 %). Le sexe masculin (odds ratio [OR] ajusté, 1,99 [intervalle de confiance à 95 % (IC95 %) : 1,07–3,72]), la fièvre (OR : 1,37 [IC95 % : 1,01–1,88]), une auscultation pulmonaire anormale à l’admission (OR ajusté : 2,62 [IC95 % : 1,40–4,90]) et un taux élevé de la protéine C réactive (CRP) (OR ajusté : 6,96 [IC95 % : 1,45–33,35] pour CRP>100mg/L vs CRP<10mg/L) étaient associés à un risque d’admission/transfert en USI. L’allongement du délai entre l’apparition des symptômes et l’admission à l’hôpital a été associé à un risque d’admission directe/transfert en USI (OR ajusté : 4,82 [IC95 % : 1,61–14,43] pour un délai>10jours vs un délai<3jours). La présence d’une monocytopénie était également associée à un risque d’admission directe/transfert en USI (OR ajusté : 2,49 [IC95 % : 1,29–4,82]). Conclusion La présentation clinique de l’infection par le SRAS-CoV-2 lors de l’admission à l’hôpital est associée au pronostic.

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the effect of offering ART initiation in the community on HIV treatment outcomes. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We searched databases between 1 January 2013 and 22 February 2021 to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies that compared offering ART initiation in a community setting to offering ART initiation in a traditional health facility or alternative community setting. We assessed risk of bias, reporting of implementation outcomes, and real-world relevance and used Mantel–Haenszel methods to generate pooled risk ratios (RRs) and risk differences (RDs) with 95% confidence intervals. We evaluated heterogeneity qualitatively and quantitatively and used GRADE to evaluate overall evidence certainty. Searches yielded 4,035 records, resulting in 8 included studies—4 RCTs and 4 observational studies—conducted in Lesotho, South Africa, Nigeria, Uganda, Malawi, Tanzania, and Haiti—a total of 11,196 PLWH. Five studies were conducted in general HIV populations, 2 in key populations, and 1 in adolescents. Community ART initiation strategies included community-based HIV testing coupled with ART initiation at home or at community venues; 5 studies maintained ART refills in the community, and 4 provided refills at the health facility. All studies were pragmatic, but in most cases provided additional resources. Few studies reported on implementation outcomes. All studies showed higher ART uptake in community initiation arms compared to facility initiation and refill arms (standard of care) (RR 1.73, 95% CI 1.22 to 2.45; RD 30%, 95% CI 10% to 50%; 5 studies). Retention (RR 1.43, 95% CI 1.32 to 1.54; RD 19%, 95% CI 11% to 28%; 4 studies) and viral suppression (RR 1.31, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.49; RD 15%, 95% CI 10% to 21%; 3 studies) at 12 months were also higher in the community-based ART initiation arms. Improved uptake, retention, and viral suppression with community ART initiation were seen across population subgroups—including men, adolescents, and key populations. One study reported no difference in retention and viral suppression at 2 years. There were limited data on adherence and mortality. Social harms and adverse events appeared to be minimal and similar between community ART initiation and standard of care. One study compared ART refill strategies following community ART initiation (community versus facility refills) and found no difference in viral suppression (RD −7%, 95% CI −19% to 6%) or retention at 12 months (RD −12%, 95% CI −23% to 0.3%). This systematic review was limited by few studies for inclusion, poor-quality observational data, and short-term outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Based on data from a limited set of studies, community ART initiation appears to result in higher ART uptake, retention, and viral suppression at 1 year compared to facility-based ART initiation. Implementation on a wider scale necessitates broader exploration of costs, logistics, and acceptability by providers and PLWH to ensure that these effects are reproducible when delivered at scale, in different contexts, and over time.","Eshun-Wilson, Ingrid; Awotiwon, Ajibola A.; Germann, Ashley; Amankwaa, Sophia A.; Ford, Nathan; Schwartz, Sheree; Baral, Stefan; Geng, Elvin H.",PLoS Med,99,26

How to operationalize resilience and to determine the factors and processes that lead to good long-term mental health outcomes in stressor-exposed individuals is a matter of ongoing debate and of critical importance for the advancement of the field. One of the biggest challenges for implementing an outcome-based definition of resilience in longitudinal observational study designs lies in the fact that real-life adversity is usually unpredictable and that its substantial qualitative as well as temporal variability between subjects often precludes defining circumscribed time windows of inter-individually comparable stressor exposure relative to which the maintenance or recovery of mental health can be determined. To address this pertinent issue, we propose to frequently and regularly monitor stressor exposure (E) and mental health problems (P) throughout a study's observation period [Frequent Stressor and Mental Health Monitoring (FRESHMO)-paradigm]. On this basis, a subject's deviation at any single monitoring time point from the study sample's normative E–P relationship (the regression residual) can be used to calculate that subject's current mental health reactivity to stressor exposure (“stressor reactivity,” SR). The SR score takes into account the individual extent of experienced adversity and is comparable between and within subjects. Individual SR time courses across monitoring time points reflect intra-individual temporal variability in SR, where periods of under-reactivity (negative SR score) are associated with accumulation of fewer mental health problems than is normal for the sample. If FRESHMO is accompanied by regular measurement of potential resilience factors, temporal changes in resilience factors can be used to predict SR time courses. An increase in a resilience factor measurement explaining a lagged decrease in SR can then be considered to index a process of adaptation to stressor exposure that promotes a resilient outcome (an allostatic resilience process). This design principle allows resilience research to move beyond merely determining baseline predictors of resilience outcomes, which cannot inform about how individuals successfully adjust and adapt when confronted with adversity. Hence, FRESHMO plus regular resilience factor monitoring incorporates a dynamic-systems perspective into resilience research.","Kalisch, Raffael; Köber, Göran; Binder, Harald; Ahrens, Kira F.; Basten, Ulrike; Chmitorz, Andrea; Choi, Karmel W.; Fiebach, Christian J.; Goldbach, Nele; Neumann, Rebecca J.; Kampa, Miriam; Kollmann, Bianca; Lieb, Klaus; Plichta, Michael M.; Reif, Andreas; Schick, Anita; Sebastian, Alexandra; Walter, Henrik; Wessa, Michèle; Yuen, Kenneth S.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the motor, cognitive, and behavioral changes during the COVID-19 lockdown in Italy in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) with and without mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI and PD-NC) and in patients with MCI not associated with PD (MCInoPD). Methods: A total of 34 patients with PD-NC, 31 PD-MCI, and 31 MCInoPD and their caregivers were interviewed 10 weeks after the COVID-19 lockdown in Italy, and changes in cognitive, behavioral, and motor symptoms were examined. Modified standardized scales, including the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) and the Movement Disorder Society, Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) Parts I and II, were administered. Multivariate logistic regression was used to evaluate associated covariates by comparing PD-NC vs. PD-MCI and MCInoPD vs. PD-MCI. Results: All groups showed a worsening of cognitive (39.6%), pre-existing (37.5%), and new (26%) behavioral symptoms, and motor symptoms (35.4%) during the COVID-19 lockdown, resulting in an increased caregiver burden in 26% of cases. After multivariate analysis, PD-MCI was significantly and positively associated with the IADL lost during quarantine (OR 3.9, CI 1.61–9.58), when compared to PD-NC. In the analysis of MCInoPD vs. PD-MCI, the latter showed a statistically significant worsening of motor symptoms than MCInoPD (OR 7.4, CI 1.09–45.44). Regarding NPI items, nighttime behaviors statistically differed in MCInoPD vs. PD-MCI (16.1% vs. 48.4%, p = 0.007). MDS-UPDRS parts I and II revealed that PD-MCI showed a significantly higher frequency of cognitive impairment (p = 0.034), fatigue (p = 0.036), and speech (p = 0.013) than PD-NC. On the contrary, PD-MCI showed significantly higher frequencies in several MDS-UPDRS items compared to MCInoPD, particularly regarding pain (p = 0.001), turning in bed (p = 0.006), getting out of bed (p = 0.001), and walking and balance (p = 0.003). Conclusion: The COVID-19 quarantine is associated with the worsening of cognitive, behavioral, and motor symptoms in subjects with PD and MCI, particularly in PD-MCI. There is a need to implement specific strategies to contain the effects of quarantine in patients with PD and cognitive impairment and their caregivers.","Baschi, Roberta; Luca, Antonina; Nicoletti, Alessandra; Caccamo, Maria; Cicero, Calogero Edoardo; D'Agate, Concetta; Di Giorgi, Lucia; La Bianca, Giuseppe; Lo Castro, Tiziana; Zappia, Mario; Monastero, Roberto",Front Psychiatry,99,16

FCoV exists in two serotypes. Type I FCoV is the dominant serotype worldwide. Therefore, it is necessary to develop antiviral drugs against type I FCoV infection. We previously reported that type I FCoV is closely associated with cholesterol throughout the viral life cycle. In this study, we investigated whether U18666A, the cholesterol synthesis and transport inhibitor, shows antiviral effects against type I FCoV. U18666A induced cholesterol accumulation in cells and inhibited type I FCoV replication. Surprisingly, the antiviral activity of U18666A was suppressed by the histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi), Vorinostat. HDACi has been reported to revert U18666A-induced dysfunction of Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1). In conclusion, these findings demonstrate that NPC1 plays an important role in type I FCoV infection.

We examined the characteristics of COVID-19 severity in an international sample of people with MS. Methods: Data from 12 data-sources in 28 countries were aggregated. Demographic and clinical covariates were queried, alongside COVID-19 clinical severity outcomes, hospitalisation, admission to ICU, requiring artificial ventilation, and death. Characteristics of outcomes were assessed in patients with suspected/confirmed COVID-19 using multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression. Results: 657 (28.1%) with suspected and 1,683 (61.9%) with confirmed COVID-19 were analysed. Older age, progressive MS-phenotype, and higher disability were associated with worse COVID-19 outcomes. Compared to dimethyl fumarate, ocrelizumab and rituximab were associated with hospitalisation (aOR=1.56,95%CI=1.01-2.41; aOR=2.43,95%CI=1.48-4.02) and ICU admission (aOR=2.30,95%CI=0.98-5.39; aOR=3.93,95%CI=1.56-9.89), though only rituximab was associated with higher risk of artificial ventilation (aOR=4.00,95%CI=1.54-10.39). Compared to pooled other DMTs, ocrelizumab and rituximab were associated with hospitalisation (aOR=1.75,95%CI=1.29-2.38; aOR=2.76,95%CI=1.87-4.07) and ICU admission (aOR=2.55,95%CI=1.49-4.36; aOR=4.32,95%CI=2.27-8.23) but only rituximab with artificial ventilation (aOR=6.15,95%CI=3.09-12.27). Compared to natalizumab, ocrelizumab and rituximab were associated with hospitalisation (aOR=1.86,95%CI=1.13-3.07; aOR=2.88,95%CI=1.68-4.92) and ICU admission (aOR=2.13,95%CI=0.85-5.35; aOR=3.23,95%CI=1.17-8.91), but only rituximab with ventilation (aOR=5.52,95%CI=1.71-17.84). Importantly, associations persisted on restriction to confirmed COVID-19 cases. No associations were observed between DMTs and death. Conclusions: Using the largest cohort of people with MS and COVID-19 available, we demonstrated consistent associations of rituximab with increased risk of hospitalisation, ICU admission, and requiring artificial ventilation, and ocrelizumab with hospitalisation and ICU admission, suggesting their use may be a risk factor for more severe COVID-19.","Simpson-Yap, S.; De Brouwer, E.; Kalincik, T.; Rijke, N.; Hillert, J.; Walton, C.; Edan, G.; MOREAU, Y.

It primarily affects the respiratory tract and lungs in some cases causing severe organ damage and pneumonia due to overwhelming immune responses. Clinical reports show that the most commons symptoms are fever, dry cough, and shortness of breath, along with several other symptoms. It is thought that an immense cytokine dysregulation in COVID-19 patients is caused following the virus infection. Notably, if patients present with pre-existing specific comorbidities like diabetes or high blood pressure, rates of COVID-19 induced complications and deaths are escalated. Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy has been shown to alleviate pneumonia and acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS) symptoms, through their immunomodulatory activities in COVID-19 patients. Although more research studies and clinical trial results are needed to elucidate the exact mechanism by which MSCs provide relief to COVID-19 infected patients. Results from clinical trials are encouraging as patients treated with MSCs, regain lung functions and have restored levels of cytokines and trophic factors underscoring the fact that stem cell therapy can be, at least, a complementary therapy to alleviate sufferings in COVID-19 patients.

Materials and Methods: A 39-question, web-based survey was sent to all urologist members of the Brazilian Society of Urology. We assessed socio-demographic, professional, health and behavior parameters. The primary goal was to evaluate changes in urologists ' clinical practice and income after two months of COVID-19. We also looked at geographical differences based on the incidence rates of COVID-19 in different states. Results: Among 766 urologists who completed the survey, a reduction [≥] 50% of patient visits, elective and emergency surgeries was reported by 83.2%, 89.6% and 54.8%, respectively. An income reduction of [≥] 50% was reported by 54.3%. Measures to reduce costs were implemented by most. Video consultations were performed by 38.7%. Modifications in health and lifestyle included weight gain (32.9%), reduced physical activity (60.0%), increased alcoholic intake (39.9%) and reduced sexual activity (34.9%). Finally, 13.5% of Brazilian urologists were infected with SARS-CoV-2 and about one third required hospitalization. Urologists from the highest COVID-19 incidence states were at a higher risk to have a reduction of patient visits and non-essential surgeries (OR=2.95, 95% CI 1.86 - 4.75; p < 0.0001) and of being infected with SARS-CoV-2 (OR=4.36 95% CI 1.74 - 10.54, p = 0.012). Conclusions: COVID-19 produced massive disturbances in Brazilian urologists' practice, with major reductions in patient visits and surgical procedures. Distressing consequences were also observed on physicians' income, health and personal lives. These findings are probably applicable to other medical specialties.","Gomes, C.

The magnitude of the disparity is unclear, however, because race/ethnicity information is often missing in surveillance data. In this study, we quantified the burden of SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospitalization, and case fatality rates in an urban county by racial/ethnic group using combined race/ethnicity imputation and quantitative bias-adjustment for misclassification. After bias-adjustment, the magnitude of the absolute racial/ethnic disparity, measured as the difference in infection rates between classified Black and Hispanic persons compared to classified White persons, increased 1.3-fold and 1.6-fold respectively. These results highlight that complete case analyses may underestimate absolute disparities in infection rates. Collecting race/ethnicity information at time of testing is optimal. However, when data are missing, combined imputation and bias-adjustment improves estimates of the racial/ethnic disparities in the COVID-19 burden.","Labgold, Katie; Hamid, Sarah; Shah, Sarita; Gandhi, Neel R.; Chamberlain, Allison; Khan, Fazle; Khan, Shamimul; Smith, Sasha; Williams, Steve; Lash, Timothy L.; Collin, Lindsay J.",medRxiv,99,1

People ≥70 were deemed “Clinically Vulnerable.” Distancing measures were introduced to reduce the risk of contracting COVID-19. However, these may have a negative impact on older people who are vulnerable to social isolation and may have challenges accessing services and provisions. Objectives: To investigate the impact of COVID-19 lockdown measures on the lives of older people. Study design and setting: Cross-sectional telephone survey. Participants: Community-dwelling older people, 76–97 years. Outcomes: Health anxiety; General health (RAND Short-form 36 Survey); Physical activity; Depression (PHQ-8); Anxiety (GAD-2); Loneliness; Access to services; Challenges, concerns and positive experiences. Data analysis: Counts (%), means (SDs). Thematic analysis was used to identify themes from open questions. Results: n = 142. 52% did not worry about their health; 76% rated their health as “good”, “very good” or “excellent”. < 10% met the criteria indicative of depression (PHQ-8), or anxiety (GAD-2). 42% were less active than before lockdown. 27% were lonely at least some of the time. Over half of participants identified positive aspects. Conclusions: Most participants reported good health with low levels of health anxiety, anxiety and depression. Many were able to identify positive aspects to lockdown and may be better equipped to deal with lockdown than anticipated. Strategies may be required to ameliorate the negative impact of loneliness for a minority of older people, and help some resume previous activity levels and pursuits.","Brown, Lesley; Mossabir, Rahena; Harrison, Nicola; Brundle, Caroline; Smith, Jane; Clegg, Andrew",Age Ageing,99,30

Design A two-hour facilitated online workshop with guided discussion. Setting Online workshop synchronously recorded via Zoom. Participants Trainees (14 doctoral; 2 MSc students; 1 post-doctoral fellow) and research faculty (5 physiotherapy; 3 occupational therapy), School of Rehabilitation Science, McMaster University, Canada. Interventions Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures Workshop transcript and field notes were cross-compared by 4 workshop facilitators from which 3 main categories emerged: 1) pandemic protocol adjustment, 2) participant accessibility, and 3) knowledge dissemination. Results 1) Pandemic protocol adjustment: Workshop participants identified concerns with transitioning pre- to post-pandemic research, such as variations in intervention protocols and psychometric properties of virtually guided outcome assessments. Strategies identified: Delivering toolkits containing equipment needed for virtually guided assessments, and their comprehensive psychometric evaluation prior to use. 2) Participant accessibility: Virtually guided rehabilitation research may present barriers to participation for some populations due to a lack of internet access and proficiency. Strategies identified: Including community stakeholders in the decision-making process to help guide the development of safe and feasible study protocols, and simplifying protocols to maintain participants’ adherence. 3) Knowledge dissemination: Virtually delivered conferences have required additional preparation time due to requirements of pre-recorded presentations, and hinder important conversations between conference attendees. Strategies identified: Researchers should account for delays in knowledge translation plans for funding applications, and conference organizers should consider hosting networking events for attendees. Conclusions This workshop served as a catalyst for creative solutions to complex methodological challenges that can be integrated within existing and future rehabilitation-focused studies during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.

Here, we assessed the immunomodulatory effects of viable and non-viable Lactiplantibacillus plantarum strains in human respiratory epithelial cells (Calu-3 cells) and the capacity of these immunobiotic lactobacilli to reduce their susceptibility to the acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Immunobiotic L. plantarum MPL16 and CRL1506 differentially modulated IFN-β, IL-6, CXCL8, CCL5 and CXCL10 production and IFNAR2, DDX58, Mx1 and OAS1 expression in Calu-3 cells stimulated with the TLR3 agonist poly(I:C). Furthermore, the MPL16 and CRL1506 strains increased the resistance of Calu-3 cells to the challenge with SARS-CoV-2. L. plantarum MPL16 induced these beneficial effects more efficiently than the CRL1506 strain. Of note, neither non-viable MPL16 and CRL1506 strains nor the non-immunomodulatory strains L. plantarum CRL1905 and MPL18 could modify the resistance of Calu-3 cells to SARS-CoV-2 infection or the immune response to poly(I:C) challenge. To date, the potential beneficial effects of immunomodulatory probiotics on SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 outcome have been extrapolated from studies carried out in the context of other viral pathogens. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of the ability of immunomodulatory lactobacilli to positively influence the replication of the new coronavirus. Further mechanistic studies and in vivo experiments in animal models of SARS-CoV-2 infection are necessary to identify specific strains of beneficial immunobiotic lactobacilli like L. plantarum MPL16 or CRL1506 for the prevention or treatment of the COVID-19.","Islam, Md.

SARS was eventually contained by means of syndromic surveillance, prompt isolation of patients, strict enforcement of quarantine of all contacts, and in some areas top-down enforcement of community quarantine. By interrupting all human-to-human transmission, SARS was effectively eradicated. By contrast, by Feb 28, 2020, within a matter of 2 months since the beginning of the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), more than 82 000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported with more than 2800 deaths. Although there are striking similarities between SARS and COVID-19, the differences in the virus characteristics will ultimately determine whether the same measures for SARS will also be successful for COVID-19. COVID-19 differs from SARS in terms of infectious period, transmissibility, clinical severity, and extent of community spread. Even if traditional public health measures are not able to fully contain the outbreak of COVID-19, they will still be effective in reducing peak incidence and global deaths. Exportations to other countries need not result in rapid large-scale outbreaks, if countries have the political will to rapidly implement countermeasures.","Wilder-Smith, Annelies; Chiew, Calvin J; Lee, Vernon J",Lancet Infect Dis,99,16

We assess the perceptions about COVID-19, the impact of the lockdown on access to health services and continuum of care for Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) among a cohort of adults in rural India. METHODOLOGY: Since 2018, we have been following up a cohort of persons with non-communicable diseases in a high NCD burden region in Srikakulam District of Andhra Pradesh under the STOP CKDu study. We conducted this mixed methods study, administered through a structured telephonic questionnaire and interview to determine the awareness, perceptions and their compliance to ongoing treatment schedules. RESULTS: Overall, 68% of the participants exhibited adequate knowledge of symptoms of COVID-19, while 43% were not aware of the mode of transmission of the virus. In all, 822 (36.1%) participants reported at least one NCD condition. Among them, 115 (14%) missed their follow-up visit, 110 (13.4%) reported facing challenges in medication procurement and 11.6% either developed new complaints or experienced worsening of pre-existing symptoms. A total of 233 (28.5%) used a telemedicine facility and took telephonic advice from (private) physicians. As the access to medicines was restricted due to the lockdown, majority of the respondents were depending on rural medical practitioners (RMPs) for the procurement of medication. CONCLUSION: Our finding implies the need for the future guidelines on adaptation of telehealth approaches within health systems to maintain the continuum of care, digital health tools to facilitate the patient's appointments including virtual follow-up visits for those with NCDs coupled with regular engagement by frontline healthcare workers at the local levels, evidence informed public health messaging taking into consideration the social and behavioural aspect and uninterrupted essential primary healthcare services.","Gummidi, Balaji; John, Oommen; Jha, Vivekanand",J Family Med Prim Care,99,0

This may be in part due to an uncontrolled immune-response to SARS-CoV-2 infection triggering a systemic hyperinflammatory response, the so-called “cytokine storm”. The reduction of this inflammatory immune-response could be considered as a potential therapeutic target against severe COVID-19. The relationship between inflammation and clot activation must also be considered. Furthermore, we must keep in mind that currently, no specific antiviral treatment is available for SARS-CoV-2. While moderate-severe forms need in-hospital surveillance plus antivirals and/or hydroxychloroquine; in severe and life-threating subsets a high intensity anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory therapy could be a therapeutic option. However, right data on the effectiveness of different immunomodulating drugs are scarce.

The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in respiratory samples from COVID-19 patients is not a direct indication of the presence of viable viruses. The isolation of SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture system however, can acts as surrogate marker of infectiousness. Cell culture based studies performed mostly with hospitalized and moderate/severe COVID-19 claims that no replication competent virus is found after 9 days of the symptoms onset in respiratory samples. Therefore, it is now recommended 10 days isolation before patient discharge. Methods. We cell-cultured 29 SARS-COV-2 RT-PCR positive respiratory samples at the 10th day after the illness in Vero E6 cells. After two passages, cytopathic effect and cycle threshold (CT) lower than the obtained in the original sample were used to determine positivity. Findings. We found viable particles in (7/29) 24% of samples tested. The positivity in cell culture was strongly associated (p<0.0001) to the low cycle thresholds in clinical samples (Ct <21). Conclusion.

We propose that subjects with metabolic syndrome, old age, and male gender have the greatest morbidity and mortality and have low stress proteins, in particular, low intracellular heme oxygenase (HO-1), making them particularly vulnerable to the disease. Additionally, COVID-19’s heme reduction may contribute to even lower HO-1. Low-grade inflammation associated with these risk factors contributes to triggering a cytokine storm that spreads to multi-organ failure and near death. The high mortality of those treated with ventilator assistance may partially be explained by ventilator-induced inflammation. The cytoprotective and anti-inflammatory properties of HO-1 can limit the infection’s damage. A paradox of COVID-19 hospital admissions data suggests that fewer cigarette-smokers are admitted compared with non-smokers in the general population. This unexpected observation may result from smoke induction of HO-1. Therapies with anti-viral properties that raise HO-1 include certain anesthetics (sevoflurane or isoflurane), hemin, estrogen, statins, curcumin, resveratrol, and melatonin. Controlled trials of these HO-1 inducers should be done in order to prevent or treat COVID-19 disease.","Hooper, Philip L.",Cell Stress Chaperones,99,22

Methods: Our cohort included all patients consecutively hospitalized who had a final outcome (death or discharge) in a 1286-bed hospital of Madrid (Spain) from 25 February (first case admitted) to 19 April 2020. The data were manually entered into an electronic case report form, which was monitored prior to the analysis. Results: We consecutively included 2226 adult patients admitted to the hospital who either died (460) or were discharged (1766). The patients’ median age was 61 years, and 51.8% were women. The most common comorbidity was arterial hypertension (41.3%), and the most common symptom on admission was fever (71.2%). The median time from disease onset to hospital admission was 6 days.

The Function and Emotion in Everyday Life with T1D (FEEL-T1D) study focuses on investigating these short-term dynamic relationships among BG, function, and emotional well-being in adults with T1D. OBJECTIVE To present the FEEL-T1D study design, methods, and study progress to date, including adaptations necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic to implement the study fully remotely. METHODS The FEEL-T1D study will recruit 200 adults 18-75 years old with T1D. Data collection includes a comprehensive survey battery, along with 14 days of intensive longitudinal data using blinded continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), ecological momentary assessments (EMA), ambulatory cognitive tasks, and accelerometers. All study procedures are conducted remotely, through mailing study equipment and using videoconferencing for study visits. RESULTS To date, after 12 months of recruitment, 124 participants have enrolled in the FEEL-T1D study. Over 87% of EMA surveys have been completed, with minimal missing data, and about 82% of participants have provided concurrent CGM, EMA, and accelerometer data for at least 10 of the 14 days of data collection. CONCLUSIONS Thus far, our reconfiguration of the FEEL-T1D protocol to be implemented remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic has been a success.

METHODS: Network centrality metrics were used to characterize hospital-acquired Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (HA-MERS) outbreaks in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia between 2012 and 2016. Covariate-adjusted multivariable logistic regression models were applied to assess the effect of individual level risk factors and network level metrics associated with increase in length of hospital stay and risk of deaths from MERS. RESULTS: About 27% of MERS cases were hospital acquired during the study period. The median age of healthcare workers and hospitalized patients were 35 years and 63 years, respectively, Although HA-MERS were more connected, we found no significant difference in degree centrality metrics between HA-MERS and non-HA-MERS cases. Pre-existing medical conditions (adjusted Odds ratio (aOR) = 2.43, 95% confidence interval: (CI) [1.11–5.33]) and hospitalized patients (aOR = 29.99, 95% CI [1.80–48.65]) were the strongest risk predictors of death from MERS. The risk of death associated with 1-day increased length of stay was significantly higher for patients with comorbidities. CONCLUSION: Our investigation also revealed that patients with an HA-MERS infection experienced a significantly longer hospital stay and were more likely to die from the disease. Healthcare worker should be reminded of their potential role as hubs for pathogens because of their proximity to and regular interaction with infected patients. On the other hand, this study has shown that while healthcare workers acted as epidemic attenuators, hospitalized patients played the role of an epidemic amplifier.","Adegboye, Oyelola; Saffary, Timor; Adegboye, Majeed; Elfaki, Faiz",J Infect Public Health,99,1

Epidemics have a long-standing history in literature. We want to analyze if society's responses to the epidemic have changed over time, and what literature can teach about the society's reaction to an epidemic. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We searched and discussed the references to the social effects of the epidemic that are provided in three famous works of European literature providing descriptions about society's reactions to an epidemic throughout the centuries have been selected: “The Decameron” by Giovanni Boccaccio, “The Betrothed” by Alessandro Manzoni, and “The Plague” by Albert Camus. RESULTS: Literature teaches us that: the epidemic's spread is often preceded and favoured by a phase of negation or under evaluation of the problem; restrictive measures are the most efficient for containing the virus’ spread; some people have difficulties in being compliant with these measures; infodemia may accompany an epidemic, feeding chaos and fear among the people. CONCLUSION: Looking at examples of epidemics reported in the past, we can conclude that the current COVID-19 pandemic shows that society's responses to an unknown disease are not changed over time.","Perciaccante, A.; Malacrea, M.; Coralli, A.; Donell, S.",Ethics Med Public Health,99,8

Since both Influenza Like Illness (ILI) and COVID-19 case definitions overlap, we re-investigated the ILI cases using PCR for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in 739 nasopharyngeal swabs collected from November 2019 to March 2020. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was found in 37 samples (5%) collected mostly during February 2020. It was followed by confirmation of evolutionary and spatial relationships using next generation sequencing (NGS). We observed that the overall incidence of ILI cases during 2019–2020 influenza season was considerably higher than previous years and was gradually replaced with SARS-CoV-2, which indicated a silent transmission among ambulatory patients. Sequencing of representative isolates confirmed independent introductions and silent transmission earlier than previously thought. Evolutionary and spatial analyses revealed clustering in the GH clade, characterized by three amino acid substitutions in spike gene (D614G), RdRp (P323L) and NS3 (Q57H). P323L causes conformational change near nsp8 binding site that might affect virus replication and transcription. In conclusion, assessment of the community transmission among patients with mild COVID-19 illness, particularly those without epidemiological link for acquiring the virus, is of utmost importance to guide policy makers to optimize public health interventions. The detection of SARS-CoV-2 in ILI cases shows the importance of ILI surveillance systems and warrants its further strengthening to mitigate the ongoing transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The effect of NS3 substitutions on oligomerization or membrane channel function (intra- and extracellular) needs functional validation.","Alosaimi, Bandar; Naeem, Asif; Alghoribi, Majed F.; Okdah, Lilian; Hamed, Maaweya E.; AlYami, Ahmad S.; Alotaibi, Athari; Enani, Mushira",Viruses,99,14

Of the total, 177 are regarded as emerging or reemerging. Zoonotic pathogens are twice as likely to be in this category as are nonzoonotic pathogens. Emerging and reemerging pathogens are not strongly associated with particular types of nonhuman hosts, but they are most likely to have the broadest host ranges. Emerging and reemerging zoonoses are associated with a wide range of drivers, but changes in land use and agriculture and demographic and societal changes are most commonly cited. However, although zoonotic pathogens do represent the most likely source of emerging and reemerging infectious disease, only a small minority have proved capable of causing major epidemics in the human population.","Woolhouse, Mark E.J.; Gowtage-Sequeria, Sonya",Emerg Infect Dis,99,8

The primary aim of this study was to determine the feasibility of a remote patient monitoring (RPM) workflow using ankle-worn IMUs measuring impact load, limb impact load asymmetry and knee range of motion in combination with patient-reported outcome measures. (Methods) A pilot cohort of 14 patients undergoing primary knee arthroplasty for osteoarthritis was prospectively enrolled. RPM in the community was performed weekly from 2 up to 6 weeks post-operatively using wearable IMUs. The following data were collected using IMUs: mobility (Bone Stimulus and cumulative impact load), impact load asymmetry and maximum knee flexion angle. In addition, scores from the Oxford Knee Score (OKS), EuroQol Five-dimension (EQ-5D) with EuroQol visual analogue scale (EQ-VAS) and 6 Minute Walk Test were collected. (Results) On average, the Bone Stimulus and cumulative impact load improved 52% (p = 0.002) and 371% (p = 0.035), compared to Post-Op Week 2. The impact load asymmetry value trended (p = 0.372) towards equal impact loading between the operative and non-operative limb. The mean maximum flexion angle achieved was 99.25° at Post-Operative Week 6, but this was not significantly different from pre-operative measurements (p = 0.1563). There were significant improvements in the mean EQ-5D (0.20; p = 0.047) and OKS (10.86; p < 0.001) scores both by 6 weeks after surgery, compared to pre-operative scores. (Conclusions) This pilot study demonstrates the feasibility of a reliable and low-maintenance workflow system to remotely monitor post-operative progress in knee arthroplasty patients. Preliminary data indicate IMU outputs relating to mobility, impact load asymmetry and range of motion can be obtained using commercially available IMU sensors. Further studies are required to directly correlate the IMU sensor outputs with patient outcomes to establish clinical significance.","Bolam, Scott M.; Batinica, Bruno; Yeung, Ted C.; Weaver, Sebastian; Cantamessa, Astrid; Vanderboor, Teresa C.; Yeung, Shasha; Munro, Jacob T.; Fernandez, Justin W.; Besier, Thor F.; Monk, Andrew Paul",Sensors (Basel),99,20

METHODS: A prospective European primary care study recruited adults with symptoms of lower respiratory tract infection between Nov-Apr 2007-2010. Real-time in-house polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed to test for six common respiratory viruses. In this secondary analysis, symptom severity (scored 1=no problem, 2=mild, 3=moderate, 4=severe) and symptom duration were compared between groups with different viral aetiologies using regression and Cox proportional hazard models, respectively. Additionally, associations between baseline viral load (cycle threshold (Ct) value) and illness course were assessed. RESULTS: The PCR tested positive for a common respiratory virus in 1,354 of the 2,957 (45.8%) included patients. The overall mean symptom score at presentation was 2.09 (95%CI 2.07-2.11) and the median duration until resolution of moderately bad or severe symptoms was 8.70 days (interquartile range 4.50-11.00). Patients with influenza virus, human metapneumovirus (hMPV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), coronavirus (CoV) or rhinovirus had a significantly higher symptom score than patients with no virus isolated (0.07-0.25 points or 2.3-8.3% higher symptom score). Time to symptom resolution was longer in RSV infections (adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) 0.80, 95%CI 0.65-0.96) and hMPV infections (AHR 0.77, 95%CI 0.62-0.94) than in infections with no virus isolated. Overall, baseline viral load was associated with symptom severity (difference 0.11, 95%CI 0.06-0.16 per 10 cycles decrease in Ct value), but not with symptom duration. CONCLUSIONS: In healthy, working adults from the general community presenting at the general practitioner with acute cough and/or suspected LRTI respiratory viruses other than influenza impose an illness burden comparable to influenza. Hence, the public health focus for viral respiratory tract infections should be broadened.","Vos, L.M.; Bruyndonckx, R.; Zuithoff, N.P.A.; Little, P.; Oosterheert, J.J.; Broekhuizen, B.D.L.; Lammens, C.; Loens, K.; Viveen, M.; Butler, C.C.; Crook, D.; Zlateva, K.; Goossens, H.; Claas, E.C.J.; Ieven, M.; Van Loon, A.M.; Verheij, T.J.M.; Coenjaerts, F.E.J.",Clin Microbiol Infect,99,28

METHODS: In this retrospective study, 226 patients diagnosed with 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) in the Chongqing University Three Gorges Hospital were included. The patients’ clinical data, including general information, initial symptoms at the onset, time of disease diagnosis, time to treatment in hospital, time of nucleic acid conversion to negative, disease classification, total time of hospitalization were collected. The clinical data of the mild and severe patients were compared. RESULTS: Fever, cough, sore throat, poor appetite andfatigue were the main symptoms of the diagnosed patients. The time of diagnosis was significantly shorter in the mild patients (4.96 ± 4.10 days) than severe patients (7.63 ± 9.17 days) (P=0.004). Mild patients had shorter time to treatment in hospital (6.09 ± 4.47 vs. 8.71 ± 9.04 days) and less time of nucleic acid conversion to negative (7.58 ± 2.51 vs. 11.6 ± 4.67 days) compared to the severe patients. CONCLUSION: The above results can be used as a quantitative basis for the “five-early”(early detection, early screening, early diagnosis, early isolation treatment, and early recovery) model. The government, the masses, and the hospitals’ joint prevention and optimization of the “five-early” model will provide important scientific reference for further prevention and control of the epidemics.","YI, Qingjie; FANG, Wei; LANG, Chunhui; MOU, Huaming; LV, Jinglong; WAN, Suxin; GUO, Lian; WANG, Yilin; LIU, Huawen; XIAO, Qing; LIU, Chunqiu; HUANG, Min; ZHANG, Bangshuo",Iran J Public Health,99,23

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clinical records of dogs aged 1 to 18 months presenting with a problem list including pyrexia (≥⃒39∙2°C) that was reproducible during referral hospitalisation were retrospectively reviewed. Signalment, history ‐ including previous treatment, clinical examination findings and diagnosis were recorded. Diagnoses were categorised as non‐infectious inflammatory, infectious, congenital, neoplastic and miscellaneous. The influence of previous treatment on the ability to reach a final diagnosis was analysed. RESULTS: A total of 140 cases was identified. Diagnosis was reached in 115 cases. Non‐infectious inflammatory disease was identified in 91 cases (79%), infectious disease in 19 cases (17%), a congenital disorder in four dogs (3%) and neoplasia in one dog (1%). Breeds most commonly identified were Border collies (17/140; 12%), beagles (16/140; 11%), Labrador retrievers (11/140; 8%), springer spaniels (9/140; 6%) and cocker spaniels (8/140; 6%).

We model an unmitigated scenario and 12 mitigation scenarios which differ in compliance behavior to social distancing strategies and to the duration of the stay-home order. Under each scenario we estimate the number of people who are likely to get infected and require medical attention, hospitalization, and ventilators. Given the per capita medical cost for each of these health states, we compute the total medical costs for each scenario and show the tradeoffs between deaths, costs, infections, compliance and the duration of stay-home order.

Recent studies on ACE-I and ARB in COVID-19 were limited by excluding outpatients, excluding patients by age, analyzing ACE-I and ARB together, imputing missing data, and/or diagnosing COVID-19 by chest computed tomography without definitive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), all of which are addressed here. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of 1023 COVID-19 patients diagnosed by RT-PCR at Stanford Hospital through April 8, 2020 with a minimum follow-up time of 14 days to investigate the association between ACE-I or ARB use with outcomes. RESULTS: Use of ACE-I or ARB medications was not associated with increased risk of hospitalization, intensive care unit admission, or death. Compared to patients with charted past medical history, there was a lower risk of hospitalization for patients on ACE-I (odds ratio (OR) 0.43; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.19–0.97; P = 0.0426) and ARB (OR 0.39; 95% CI 0.17–0.90; P = 0.0270). Compared to patients with hypertension not on ACE-I or ARB, patients on ARB medications had a lower risk of hospitalization (OR 0.09; 95% CI 0.01–0.88; P = 0.0381). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the use of ACE-I and ARB is not associated with adverse outcomes and may be associated with improved outcomes in COVID-19, which is immediately relevant to care of the many patients on these medications.","Rubin, Samuel J.

Although invariant in humans, the Env binding domain of the chimpanzee CD4 is highly polymorphic, with nine coding variants circulating in wild populations. Here, we show that within-species CD4 diversity is not unique to chimpanzees but found in many African primate species. Characterizing the outermost (D1) domain of the CD4 protein in over 500 monkeys and apes, we found polymorphic residues in 24 of 29 primate species, with as many as 11 different coding variants identified within a single species. D1 domain amino acid replacements affected SIV Env-mediated cell entry in a single-round infection assay, restricting infection in a strain- and allele-specific fashion. Several identical CD4 polymorphisms, including the addition of N-linked glycosylation sites, were found in primate species from different genera, providing striking examples of parallel evolution. Moreover, seven different guenons (Cercopithecus spp.) shared multiple distinct D1 domain variants, pointing to long-term trans-specific polymorphism. These data indicate that the HIV/SIV Env binding region of the primate CD4 protein is highly variable, both within and between species, and suggest that this diversity has been maintained by balancing selection for millions of years, at least in part to confer protection against primate lentiviruses. Although long-term SIV-infected species have evolved specific mechanisms to avoid disease progression, primate lentiviruses are intrinsically pathogenic and have left their mark on the host genome.","Russell, Ronnie M.; Bibollet-Ruche, Frederic; Liu, Weimin; Sherrill-Mix, Scott; Li, Yingying; Connell, Jesse; Loy, Dorothy E.; Trimboli, Stephanie; Smith, Andrew G.; Avitto, Alexa N.; Gondim, Marcos V.

We aimed to determine the association between sociodemographic factors and mental health symptoms at 8 weeks (baseline) after a COVID-19 test, and compare prevalence of mental health symptoms at baseline to those at 16-week follow-up. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Prospective cohort study of adults who received outpatient COVID-19 testing at primary care clinics. Logistic regression analyses were used to assess the association between sociodemographic characteristics and COVID-19 test results with mental health symptoms. Mental health symptoms reported at baseline were compared to symptoms at 16 weeks follow-up using conditional logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: At baseline, a total of 124 (47.51%) participants reported at least mild depressive symptoms, 110 (42.15%) participants endorsed at least mild anxiety symptoms, and 94 participants (35.21%) endorsed hazardous use of alcohol. Females compared to males were at increased risk of at least mild depressive symptoms at baseline (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR): 2.08; 95% CI: 1.14-3.79). The odds of at least mild depressive symptoms was significantly lower among those residing in zip codes within the highest quartile compared to lowest quartile of household income (AOR: 0.37; 95% CI: 0.17-0.81). Also, non-Hispanic Whites had significantly higher odds of reporting hazardous alcohol use compared to non-Whites at baseline (AOR: 1.94; 95% CI: 1.05-3.57).

Using a multidisciplinary approach, we identified and validated the hepatitis C virus (HCV) protease inhibitor simeprevir as an especially promising repurposable drug for treating COVID-19. Simeprevir potently reduces SARS-CoV-2 viral load by multiple orders of magnitude and synergizes with remdesivir in vitro. Mechanistically, we showed that simeprevir not only inhibits the main protease (M(pro)) and unexpectedly the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) but also modulates host immune responses. Our results thus reveal the possible anti-SARS-CoV-2 mechanism of simeprevir and highlight the translational potential of optimizing simeprevir as a therapeutic agent for managing COVID-19 and future outbreaks of CoV.","Lo, Ho Sing; Hui, Kenrie Pui Yan; Lai, Hei-Ming; He, Xu; Khan, Khadija Shahed; Kaur, Simranjeet; Huang, Junzhe; Li, Zhongqi; Chan, Anthony K.

Healthy skin microbial communities are dominated by bacteria with low viral representation(1–3), mainly bacteriophage. Specific eukaryotic viruses have been implicated in both common and rare skin diseases, but cataloging skin viral communities has been limited. Alterations in host immunity provide an opportunity to expand our understanding of microbial-host interactions. Primary immunedeficient patients manifest with various viral bacterial, fungal and parasitic infections, including skin infections(4). Dedicator of cytokinesis 8 (DOCK8) deficiency is a rare primary human immunodeficiency characterized by recurrent cutaneous and systemic infections, as well as atopy and cancer susceptibility(5). DOCK8, encoding a guanine nucleotide exchange factor highly expressed in lymphocytes, regulates actin cytoskeleton, which is critical for migration through collagen-dense tissues, such as skin(6). Analyzing deep metagenomic sequencing data from DOCK8-deficient skin samples demonstrated a notable increase in eukaryotic viral representation and diversity as compared to healthy volunteers. De novo assembly approaches identified hundreds of novel human papillomavirus genomes, illuminating microbial dark matter. Expansion of the skin virome in DOCK8-deficient patients underscores the importance of immune surveillance in controlling eukaryotic viral colonization and infection.","Tirosh, Osnat; Conlan, Sean; Deming, Clay; Lee-Lin, Shih-Queen; Huang, Xin; Su, Helen C.; Freeman, Alexandra F.; Segre, Julia A.; Kong, Heidi H.",Nat Med,99,33

As a result, each government has proposed emergency public health measures that are critical to delay the transmission and spread of the virus and mitigate its impacts. In Brazil, the outbreak triggered many cases of people infected with COVID-19. Considering there are no drugs or vaccines proven to be effective to treat the disease, analyzing the data of infection cases and their mathematical interpretation are essential for supporting and guiding governmental measures to suppress and mitigate the impact of COVID-19. This means that estimates with mathematical models to assess the development potential of sustained human-human transmission are needed. Since the disease has its own biological characteristics, the models need to be adapted to the variability of the regions characteristics and the decision-making by both the government and the population, in order to be able to deal with real situations. Thus, in the present paper, we analyzed the official data of COVID-19 in Brazil and used the Johnson-Mehl-Avrami-Kolmogorov (JMAK) equation to predict the evolution of the disease. The model indicates that a nucleation rate is of fourth order, which indicates that Brazilians are crowding with no respect to measures of social distance and disease prevention. In our opinion, the political authorities were unable to control the spread of the disease in Brazil, given that social mobility was interrupted by the federal and state governments.","Passos, C. A.

The ability of an organization to grow is heavily influenced by job satisfaction and employee motivation. OBJECTIVE This study examines the factors affecting employee motivation and job satisfaction among medical and dental college faculty members in Pakistan, both in the private and public sector, during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS Medical and dental college faculty in Pakistan comprised the sample for this multi-centric cross-sectional study. A questionnaire, which was modified from an existing study, was distributed electronically. A student's independent t-test was applied to compare the mean scores of the responses from public and private sector employees. RESULTS Of the 466 total respondents, 55 %were female and 45 %male. Public sector faculty reported receiving adequate resources and preferred online teaching. Both public and private sector faculty reported being satisfied with regular workshops and training. Private sector employees demonstrated more satisfaction with workplace safety measures. Public sector faculty highlighted the positive influence of job security and timely salary payments on productivity. CONCLUSION Faculty members from both the public and private sector find working from home to be easier and better for handling one's workload. Public sector faculty noted job security, timely salary payments, and an individual's sense of achievement as sources of motivation. Private institutes are more lacking in ensuring their faculty feel content and satisfied. Measures should be undertaken to improve the level of motivation felt by faculty members, especially in the private sector.","Ali, Saqib; Alam, Beenish Fatima; Noreen, Sara; Anwar, Madiha; Qazi, Sabeen Hashmat; Hussain, Talib",Work,99,30

Many innovative solutions have been suggested to deal with the possible shortage in desperate situations like disasters, pandemics and resource-limited settings. Although splitting of invasive ventilation has been reported previously, no attempts to split non-invasive respiratory support have been reported. OBJECTIVE: The primary objective was to test the feasibility of splitting the bCPAP assembly using a T-piece splitter in a simulation model. METHODS: A pilot simulation-based study was done to split a single bCPAP assembly using a T-piece. Other materials consisted of a heated humidification system, an air oxygen blender, corrugated inspiratory and expiratory tubing, nasal interfaces and two intercostal chest tube drainage bags. Two pressure manometers were used simultaneously to measure delivered pressures at different levels of set bCPAPs at the expiratory limb of nasal interfaces. RESULTS: Pressures measured at the expiratory end of two nasal interfaces were 5.1 and 5.2 cm H(2)O, respectively, at a flow of 6 L/min and a water level of 5 cm H(2)O in both chest bags. When tested across different levels of set continuous positive airway pressure (3–8 cmH(2)O) and fractional inspired oxygen concentration (0.30–1.0), measured parameters corresponded to set parameters. CONCLUSION: bCPAP splitting using a T-piece splitter is a technically simple, feasible and reliable strategy tested in a simulation model. Further testing is needed in a simulated lung model.","Verma, Akanksha; Jaiswal, Rahul; Naranje, Kirti M; Gupta, Girish; Singh, Anita",Arch Dis Child,99,16
