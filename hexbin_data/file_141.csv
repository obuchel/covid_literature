569,The role of non-formal education in combating the HIV epidemic in the Philippines and Taiwan,2010-02-23,"The Philippines is experiencing a low but slowly growing prevalence of HIV, with a UN estimate of 6,000–11,000 cases out of a population of 91 million, and a 150% increase in new cases in 2008 compared to previous years. Earlier education programmes employed non-formal educational training techniques in the southern Philippines to target high-risk groups such as female sex workers and their establishment managers; the effort was expanded to target males in the community. In comparison, as of 2009, Taiwan has an estimated 40,000 cases of HIV/AIDS in a population of 23 million. It experienced a major increase in HIV infection among injecting drug users, from 77 newly reported cases in 2003 to 2,381 such cases in 2007. This article compares and contrasts the response to the epidemic in each country, describing non-formal educational programmes targeted and tailored to specific high-risk populations.","Morisky, Donald E.; Lyu, Shu-Yu; Urada, Lianne A.",Prospects (Paris),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3106305/,141
5450,A stochastic recovery model of influenza pandemic effects on interdependent workforce systems,2015-02-01,"Three unrecognized field isolates of Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV) were recovered from commercial broiler chickens vaccinated with live Mass viral strain (H120). These isolates were identified by immunofluorescence using monoclonal antibodies produced against reference serotypes: Mass, Conn, and Ark. RT-PCRs were performed on viral RNAs to amplify S1 gene using a specific set of primers S1OLIGO3′ and S1OLIGO5′. Restriction polymorphism (RFLP) of PCR products was determined by the use of HaeIII restriction enzyme. As expected, patterns of PCR products were different from common pattern of strains assigned to Mass serotype M41, Beaudette, H120, and Florida. Molecular analysis showed a nucleotide insertion in hypervariable region one (HVR-1) of S1 gene of only Quebec isolates (Qu16, Qu_mv and Q_37zm). However, New Brunswick IBV isolate (NB_cp) did not display these insertions. Major amino acid changes involved insertion of two stretches (aa(118–119): Arg–Ser and aa(141–145): Sys–Ser–Asn–Ala–Ser–Cys) located at N-terminal and C-terminal regions of HVR-2. It is speculated that cysteine residue located upstream and downstream of Cys–Ser–Asn–Ala–Ser–Cys segment might be involved in the formation of loop structure and disulfide bond that could trigger important epitope changes. Insertion of new NXT and NXS (X≠P) glycosylation motifs scattered along S1 region and insertion of cysteine residues in HVR are contributing to the antigenic shifting of Quebec isolates. Fragment insertions were thought to be induced by inter-serotype recombination between vaccine strain (H120) that belongs to Mass serotype and another strain belonging to Ark serotype. Phylogenetic tree based on amino acid sequences showed that Quebec isolates formed a new phylogenetic cluster.","Smati, Ridha; Silim, Amer; Guertin, Claude; Henrichon, Marc; Marandi, Mehdi; Arella, Max; Merzouki, Abderrazzak",Virus Genes,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7089411/,141

8860,Social influence and spread dynamics in social networks,2012-09-19,"Delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH)-like reactions to feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) virus (FIPV) were induced in the skin of nine cats that were asymptomatic after a previous challenge-exposure with FIPV. Four of the nine previously challenge-exposed cats were negative for virus-neutralizing antibodies against FIPV at the time of intradermal (ID) testing for DTH. Two other cats tested for DTH when acutely ill with clinical FIP did not have cutaneous DTH responses to FIPV. Gross skin reactions to FIPV injected ID were observed in six of nine asymptomatic cats (67%) at postintradermal inoculation hours (PIH) 24, 48, and/or 72. The reactions consisted of focal, 1–5-mm to 2.5-cm diameter indurated or semi-firm, nonerythematous, slightly raised nodules. Microscopically, DTH-like reactions were observed in biopsies taken from the FIPV-inoculated skin of asymptomatic cats at PIH 24 to 72. The lesions consisted of perivascular and diffuse dermal infiltrations by macrophages, lymphocytes, and polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN). The dermal infiltrates, which were maximal at PIH 48 or 72, were predominantly mixed inflammatory cells (five of nine cats) or PMN (four of nine cats) at PIH 24, but later were predominantly mononuclear cells (six of nine cats) or mixed inflammatory cells (two of nine cats) at PIH 72. Five of nine cats (56%) with positive DTH skin responses had increased survival times after lethal ID challenge-exposure with FIPV compared to mean survival times in FIPV-naive, non-immune control cats that were DTH-negative when ID challenge-exposed. Four of nine DTH-positive cats (44%) resisted an ID challenge-exposure dose of FIPV that was fatal in both control cats, and two of the four remaining DTH-positive cats survived a third challenge-exposure with highly lethal doses of FIPV given intraperitoneally. Four of the six DTH-positive cats (67%) that died after re-challenge and were necropsied had lesions of noneffusive FIP, suggesting that cellular immunity may also be involved in the pathogenesis of noneffusive disease, whereas both control cats and both DTH-negative cats with clinical disease succumbed to effusive FIP. Seemingly, DTH responses to FIPV can be associated with an increased level of resistance to disease; however, this state of immunity is variable and apparently can be lost with time in some cats.","Weiss, R.C.; Cox, N.R.",Vet Immunol Immunopathol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7133611/,141

Patients with some of these disorders present with hypoglycemia, hyperamonemia, and microvesicular fatty change of hepatocytes. In the present study we examined pathogen‐free, SCAD deficient BALB/cByJ mice and control BALB/cBy mice for biochemical and tissue changes following fasting or salicylate challenge. We observed mitochondrial swelling and microvesicular fatty changes in hepatocytes in mutant mice, especially severe following a fast. However, fasting did not alter their blood ammonia and there was no apparent clinical disease. Similarly, salicylates did not produce disease in the BALB/cByJ mice.

11840,Level-Set Segmentation-Based Respiratory Volume Estimation Using a Depth Camera,2018-09-28,"The 2011 nuclear disaster in Fukushima was not only a health disaster, but also an information disaster. Although media can promote health communication following disasters, studies have revealed associations between media information and negative psychological reactions. To clarify the relationship between media utilization and current health anxiety due to radiation exposure, a cross-sectional questionnaire survey was conducted in Fukushima. We selected 2000 subjects from evacuation (i.e., 500) and non-evacuation (i.e., 1500) areas by two-stage stratified random sampling. As the independent variable, participants were asked about current health anxiety due to radiation exposure at the time of answering the questionnaire. For utilization of media about radiation exposure, local media, national media, Internet media, public broadcasts, and public relations information from local government were set as the dependent variables. Questionnaire data were analyzed by evacuation type (i.e., forced/voluntary). In a multivariate logistic regression analysis, the use of public relations information was significantly associated with lower anxiety for the forced evacuees (odds ratio: 0.72; 95% confidence interval: 0.56–0.93). Our findings highlight the importance of public relations information from local government in terms of it being associated with lower current health anxiety, and this could potentially aid in preparing for future disasters.","Orui, Masatsugu; Nakayama, Chihiro; Kuroda, Yujiro; Moriyama, Nobuaki; Iwasa, Hajime; Horiuchi, Teruko; Nakayama, Takeo; Sugita, Minoru; Yasumura, Seiji",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7312024/,141

16227,Spatiotemporal characteristics and driving forces of terrorist attacks in Belt and Road regions,2021-03-11,"Endothelial dysfunction, which is characterized by damage to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria, is involved in a variety of cardiovascular disorders. Here, we explored whether mitochondrial damage and ER stress are associated with endothelial dysfunction. We also examined whether and how melatonin protects against oxidized low-density lipoprotein- (ox-LDL-) induced damage in endothelial cells. We found that CHOP, GRP78, and PERK expressions, which are indicative of ER stress, increased significantly in response to ox-LDL treatment. ox-LDL also induced mitochondrial dysfunction as evidenced by decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, increased mitochondrial ROS levels, and downregulation of mitochondrial protective factors. In addition, ox-LDL inhibited antioxidative processes, as evidenced by decreased antioxidative enzyme activity and reduced Nrf2/HO-1 expression. Melatonin clearly reduced ER stress and promoted mitochondrial function and antioxidative processes in the presence of ox-LDL. Molecular investigation revealed that ox-LDL activated the JNK/Mff signaling pathway, and melatonin blocked this effect. These results demonstrate that ox-LDL induces ER stress and mitochondrial dysfunction and activates the JNK/Mff signaling pathway, thereby contributing to endothelial dysfunction. Moreover, melatonin inhibited JNK/Mff signaling and sustained ER homeostasis and mitochondrial function, thereby protecting endothelial cells against ox-LDL-induced damage.","Li, Peng; Xie, Changlian; Zhong, Jiankai; Guo, Zhongzhou; Guo, Kai; Tu, Qiuyun",Oxid Med Cell Longev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7952160/,141
20010,Trusting the experts: The domain-specificity of prestige-biased social learning,2021-08-11,"BACKGROUND: Multiple studies regarding the use of Resuscitative Endovascular Balloon Occlusion of the Aorta (REBOA) in patients with non-compressible torso injuries and uncontrolled haemorrhagic shock were recently published. To date, the clinical evidence of the efficacy of REBOA is still debated. We aimed to conduct a systematic review assessing the clinical efficacy and safety of REBOA in patients with major trauma and uncontrolled haemorrhagic shock. METHODS: We systematically searched MEDLINE (PubMed), EMBASE and CENTRAL up to June 2020. All randomized controlled trials and observational studies that investigated the use of REBOA compared to resuscitative thoracotomy (RT) with/without REBOA or no-REBOA were eligible. We followed the PRISMA and MOOSE guidelines. Two authors independently extracted data and appraised the risk of bias of included studies. Effect sizes were pooled in a meta-analysis using random-effects models. The quality of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation methodology. Primary outcomes were mortality, volume of infused blood components, health-related quality of life, time to haemorrhage control and any adverse effects. Secondary outcomes were improvement in haemodynamic status and failure/success of REBOA technique. RESULTS: We included 11 studies (5866 participants) ranging from fair to good quality. REBOA was associated with lower mortality when compared to RT (aOR 0.38; 95% CI 0.20–0.74), whereas no difference was observed when REBOA was compared to no-REBOA (aOR 1.40; 95% CI 0.79–2.46). No significant difference in health-related quality of life between REBOA and RT (p = 0.766). The most commonly reported complications were amputation, haematoma and pseudoaneurysm. Sparse data and heterogeneity of reporting for all other outcomes prevented any estimate. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings on overall mortality suggest a positive effect of REBOA among non-compressible torso injuries when compared to RT but no differences compared to no-REBOA. Variability in indications and patient characteristics prevents any conclusion deserving further investigation. REBOA should be promoted in specific training programs in an experimental setting in order to test its effectiveness and a randomized trial should be planned.

21808,Applying Fuzzy Fault Tree Method to Evaluate the Reliability of College Classroom Teaching,2021-09-14,"The PROGRESS trial (Perindopril Protection Against Recurrent Stroke Study) conducted in the early 1990s showed that blood pressure (BP) lowering therapy reduced the risks of recurrent stroke by about 50% after spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). However, the ICH subgroup was a minority, and trial cohorts are invariably selective. Therefore, it is unclear whether the impact of BP control on risk of recurrent stroke in ICH observed in PROGRESS would be as great in real-world practice. METHODS: We compared BP control (mean BP during study follow-up) and risks of recurrent stroke after first-ever primary ICH in 2 colocated population-based studies before and after the PROGRESS trial (1995–2001) in Oxfordshire: Oxfordshire Community Stroke Project (OCSP; 1981–1986) and OXVASC (Oxford Vascular Study; 2002–2018). RESULTS: Two hundred seventy-seven patients (753 patient-years of follow-up) with first-ever primary ICH were ascertained in OXVASC and OCSP. Baseline systolic BP was comparable between the 2 studies (mean/SD=183.8/36.5 in OXVASC versus 178.1/38.2 in OCSP, P=0.30) but among one hundred thirty-seven 90-day survivors, mean BP during follow-up was substantially lower in OXVASC versus OCSP (135.2/16.4 versus 157.3/17.8, P<0.0001). Risks of recurrent stroke (per 100 patient-years) decreased from 10.3 (95% CI, 4.7–19.5) in OCSP to 3.1 (1.8–4.8) in OXVASC (P=0.006), predominantly driven by a reduction at younger ages (5-year risk at age <75 years: 35.4% versus 6.9%, P=0.001; hazard ratio, 0.14 [0.04–0.54]). CONCLUSIONS: Risks of recurrent stroke after primary ICH have fallen significantly in Oxfordshire over the past 4 decades, coinciding with substantial improvements in BP control during follow-up.","Li, Linxin; Zuurbier, Susanna M.; Kuker, Wilhelm; Warlow, Charles P.; Rothwell, Peter M.",Stroke,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8478103/,141

An effective post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) strategy may limit the spread of infection; however, there is no consensus regarding PEP for MERS-CoV infection. In this study, we assessed (1) the efficacy of oral ribavirin and lopinavir/ritonavir as PEP for HCWs exposed to patients with severe MERS-CoV pre-isolation pneumonia, and (2) safety of the PEP regimen. METHODS: We retrospectively enrolled 43 HCWs with high-risk exposure to MERS-CoV from 5 hospitals affected during this outbreak in South Korea. The rate of MERS-CoV infection was compared between 22 workers at 1 hospital who received PEP consisting of oral ribavirin and lopinavir/ritonavir after exposure to patients with severe MERS-CoV pre-isolation pneumonia and 21 workers at other hospitals who did not receive PEP. RESULTS: Six workers (14%) developed MERS-CoV infection; all of these subjects belonged to the non-PEP group. The attack rate was lower in the PEP group compared with the non-PEP group (0% vs. 28.6%; Odds ratio = 0.405, 95% confidence interval = 0.274–0.599; P = 0.009). The most commonly reported side effects of PEP therapy were nausea and diarrhea, but there were no severe adverse effects associated with PEP therapy. CONCLUSION: PEP with a combination of oral ribavirin and lopinavir/ritonavir appears to be effective and generally safe for preventing MERS-CoV infection after high-risk exposure in healthcare workers.

In China, the government is the main provider of health and social services, and the role of NGOs is more limited than in other countries. Despite this, China has opened the door for NGO participation in its AIDS response, initially because of donor pressure but increasingly due to official acknowledgment of the important role these groups play in controlling the epidemic. Since the first AIDS NGOs were established in China in the 1990s, Chinese AIDS NGOs have made unique contributions to China’s AIDS response in critical areas like access to drugs, support for treatment compliance, outreach to marginalized at-risk groups, and efforts to reduce stigma among marginalized populations. However, there has been a substantial drop-off in donor funding in recent years, and although the Chinese government has filled the funding gap, demonstrating its commitment to the sector, recent policy moves toward greater control over the work and funding of NGOs threatens their survival. Thus far, China’s AIDS response has been noteworthy, but these new NGO funding and regulatory developments pose significant challenges to the next phase of outreach, prevention, treatment, and care.","Kaufman, Joan",HIV/AIDS in China,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7119907/,141

24480,Ontology Evolution: MEDLINE Case Study,2005,"Damage control resuscitation is a resuscitation modality that integrates permissive hypotension, hemostatic resuscitation, and damage control surgery, initially addressing all three components of the “lethal triad”: coagulopathy, acidosis, and hypothermia. Trauma patients predicted to require massive transfusion, administration of fresh frozen plasma, packed red blood cells, and platelets in a 1:1:1 ratio (of individual units) are associated with improved survival and less need for innumerous transfusions. In addition, the evidence so far indicates that the incorporation of these principles into a MTP will also contribute to less transfused units by minimizing variability of transfusion practices. Importantly, fewer units transfused will contribute to fewer complications associated with transfusions. These conclusions will need to be verified, especially with regard to the effect of MTPs incorporating higher ratios of FFP:PRBC:platelets effect on varying mechanism of injury, the timing of transfusions, and the number of units actually transfused. Also recombinant factor VIIa, cryoprecipitate, and tranexamic acid can be considered adjunctive treatments for coagulopathy. Lastly, damage control surgery is a surgical strategy aimed at restoring normal physiology rather than anatomical integrity; however, this component of damage control resuscitation should not be applied in isolation.","Duchesne, Juan Carlos; Pereira, Bruno Monteiro; Fraga, Gustavo Pereira",Trauma Surgery,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120797/,141

25515,Case Study: The continuous realization of growth synergies,2008,"Proteases are enzymes that have the capacity to hydrolyze peptide bonds and degrade other proteins. Proteases can promote inflammation by regulating expression and activity of different pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and other immune components in the lung compartment. They are categorized in three major subcategories: serine proteases, metalloproteases and cysteine proteases especially in case of lung diseases. Neutrophil-derived serine proteases (NSPs), metalloproteases and some mast cell-derived proteases are mainly focused here. Their modes of actions are different in different diseases for e.g. NE induces the release of IL-8 from lung epithelial cells through a MyD88/IRAK/TRAF-6-dependent pathway and also through EGFR MAPK pathway. NSPs contribute to immune regulation during inflammation through the cleavage and activation of specific cellular receptors. MMPs can also influence the progression of various inflammatory processes and there are many non-matrix substrates for MMPs, such as chemokines, growth factors and receptors. During lung inflammation interplay between NE and MMP is an important significant phenomenon. They have been evaluated as therapeutic targets in several inflammatory lung diseases. Here we review the role of proteases in various lung inflammatory diseases with emphasis on their mode of action and contribution to immune regulation during inflammation.","Chakraborty, Kaustav; Bhattacharyya, Arindam",Proteases in Health and Disease,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122125/,141

Approximately 30% of all insecticides applied worldwide are used to control insects affecting vegetables and fruits. Transgenic, or more commonly referred to as genetically modified (GM), vegetables and fruits offer unique opportunities for controlling insects and the pathogens they transmit. Aphid transmitted viruses have been particularly difficult to manage by tactics aimed at reducing aphid populations and in many cases there has not been virus resistant plant germplasm. Farmers in the USA have benefited from having GM virus resistant squash and papaya available to them as tools in their overall IPM programs. In the USA, Bt sweet corn has proven effective for control of Lepidoptera and continues to be accepted in the fresh market. However, the best opportunities for GM vegetables and fruits are in developing countries where 83% of the world’s population lives, the majority of vegetables and fruits are produced and pest problems are most acute.","Shelton, Anthony M.; Fuchs, Marc; Shotkoski, Frank A.",Integration of Insect-Resistant Genetically Modified Crops within IPM Programs,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122171/,141

25831,Our World as a Learning System: A Communities-of-Practice Approach,2010,"Acute rejection is an important risk factor for bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome, the clinical manifestation of chronic airway rejection in lung allograft recipients. Patients with acute rejection might be asymptomatic or present with symptoms that are not specific and can be also seen in other conditions. Clinical tests such as pulmonary function tests and imaging studies among others usually are abnormal; however, their results are also not specific for acute rejection. Histopathologic features of acute rejection in adequate samples of transbronchial lung biopsy of the lung allograft are currently the gold standard to assess for acute rejection in lung transplant recipients. Acute alloreactive injury can affect both the vasculature and the airways. Currently, the guidelines of the 2007 International Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation consensus conference are recommended for the histopathologic assessment of rejection. There are no specific morphologic features recognized to diagnose antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) in lung allografts. Therefore, the diagnosis of AMR currently requires a “triple test” including clinical features, serologic evidence of donor-specific antibodies, and pathologic findings supportive of AMR. Complement 4d deposition is used to support a diagnosis of AMR in many solid organ transplants; however, its significance for the diagnosis of AMR in lung allografts is not entirely clear. This chapter discusses the currently recommended guidelines for the assessment of cellular rejection of lung allografts and summarizes our knowledge about morphologic features and immunophenotypic tests that might help in the diagnosis of AMR.","Roden, Anja C.; Tazelaar, Henry D.",Lung Transplantation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122533/,141

In 1967, U.S. Surgeon General William H. Stewart declared “it was time to close the book on infectious diseases” (Garrett, 1994, citing W.H. Stewart, “A Mandate for State Action,” presented at the Association of State and Territorial Health Officers, Washington, DC, December 4, 1967). In the latter half of the twentieth century, many shared this bold view that medical science had vanquished infectious disease. As a result, public health struggled to remain relevant in the face of advances in pharmaceuticals, surgery, genetics and other areas that were becoming increasingly dominant in the quest to extend and enhance human life. SARS forced many to rethink the significance of public health and the crisis, though relatively short-lived, (for commentary on the disparities between the responses to HIV and SARS, see e.g. Altman (2003)) underscored the need to rebuild public health capacity that had been allowed to slip down the health system priority list.","Ries, Nola M.",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7162264/,141

The intention is to show whether a given treatment can be identified as having a beneficial clinical effect and to demonstrate this by the effect on, among other factors, cellular immunity. In order to show that the inclusion of a particular nutrient would have a beneficial effect on cellular immunity, and thus the postoperative course, the research is often related to various types of postoperative immuno-nutrition. This chapter will briefly describe various types of immuno-nutrition and the influence of the added nutrients on cellular immunity. In describing cellular immunity, many different lymphocyte subpopulations have been used, along with markers to describe their activity. As all the different subpopulations can be difficult to remember and understand, the aim of this chapter is to give the reader a short overview of the cellular immunity aspects. It will also give a brief overview of the two types of cells most often described in the literature and their function in the immune response. Many articles indicate the subpopulations of different lymphocyte groups in percentages, making it difficult to understand the comparisons between the different phases of, for example, a postoperative course. This chapter will provide a summary of the investigative procedures described in the literature and explain how to proceed with tests and analyses and how to specify the results so that they can be used to compare the results obtained at different times during the test period. A brief description of the flow cytometric method has therefore been included to give the reader an understanding of how the number of subpopulation percentages is indicated.","Platz, Mette; Poulsen, Anja; Beier-Holgersen, Randi",Diet and Nutrition in Critical Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7176231/,141

A cohort of 100 patients was enrolled from 2001 to 2003 in which 50 patients had clinically diagnosed viral RTI and 50 were asymptomatic. All patients had nasopharyngeal and throat swabs taken for respiratory virus antigen detection, culture and RT‐PCR. All patients had pulmonary function tests at regular intervals for 12 months. Rates of rejection, decline in forced expiratory volume (L) in 1 s (FEV‐1) and bacterial and fungal superinfection were compared at the 3‐month primary endpoint. In the 50 patients with RTI, a microbial etiology was identified in 33 of 50 (66%) and included rhinovirus (9), coronavirus (8), RSV (6), influenza A (5), parainfluenza (4) and human metapneumovirus (1). During the 3‐month primary endpoint, 8 of 50 (16%) RTI patients had acute rejection versus 0 of 50 non‐RTI patients (p = 0.006). The number of patients experiencing a 20% or more decline in FEV‐1 by 3 months was 9 of 50 (18%) RTI versus 0 of 50 non‐RTI (0%) (p = 0.003). In six of these nine patients, the decline in FEV‐1 was sustained over a 1‐year period consistent with bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS).

Off-policy reinforcement learning methods based on Q-learning and actor-critic methods are commonly used to train RS. Though these methods can leverage previously collected dataset for sampling efficient training, they are sensitive to the distribution of off-policy data and make limited progress unless more on-policy data are collected. However, allowing a badly-trained RS to interact with customers can result in unpredictable loss. Therefore, it is highly desirable that the off-policy method can stably train an RS when the off-policy data is fixed and there is no further interaction with the environment. To fulfill these requirements, we devise a novel method name Generator Constrained Q-learning (GCQ). GCQ additionally trains an action generator via supervised learning. The generator is used to mimic data distribution and stabilize the performance of recommendation policy. Empirical studies show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques on both offline and simulated online environments.","Wang, Chengwei; Zhou, Tengfei; Chen, Chen; Hu, Tianlei; Chen, Gang",Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206175/,141

Question Answering (QA) over Knowledge Graphs (KGs) is seen as the technology which is able to bridge this gap. It aims to build systems which are capable of extracting the answer to a user’s natural language question from an RDF dataset. In recent years, many approaches were proposed which tackle the problem of QA over KGs. Despite such efforts, it is hard and cumbersome to create a Question Answering system on top of a new RDF dataset. The main open challenge remains portability, i.e., the possibility to apply a QA algorithm easily on new and previously untested RDF datasets. In this publication, we address the problem of portability by presenting an architecture for a portable QA system. We present a novel approach called QAnswer KG, which allows the construction of on-demand QA systems over new RDF datasets. Hence, our approach addresses non-expert users in QA domain. In this paper, we provide the details of QA system generation process. We show that it is possible to build a QA system over any RDF dataset while requiring minimal investments in terms of training. We run experiments using 3 different datasets. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to design a process for non-expert users. We enable such users to efficiently create an on-demand, scalable, multilingual, QA system on top of any RDF dataset.","Diefenbach, Dennis; Giménez-García, José; Both, Andreas; Singh, Kamal; Maret, Pierre",The Semantic Web,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7250626/,141
33383,Conclusion and Further Thoughts,2020-05-30,"The study of Self-organizing lists deals with the problem of lowering the average-case asymptotic cost of a list data structure receiving query accesses in Non-stationary Environments (NSEs) with the so-called “locality of reference” property. The de facto schemes for Adaptive lists in such Environments are the Move To Front (MTF) and Transposition (TR) rules. However, significant drawbacks exist in the asymptotic accuracy and speed of list re-organization for the MTF and TR rules. This paper improves on these schemes using the design of an Adaptive list data structure as a hierarchical data “sub”-structure. In this framework, we employ a hierarchical Singly-Linked-Lists on Singly-Linked-Lists (SLLs-on-SLLs) design, which divides the list data structure into an outer and inner list context. The inner-list context is itself a SLLs containing sub-elements of the list, while the outer-list context contains these sublist partitions as its primitive elements. The elements belonging to a particular sublist partition are determined using reinforcement learning schemes from the theory of Learning Automata. In this paper, we show that the Transitivity Pursuit-Enhanced Object Migration Automata (TPEOMA) can be used in conjunction with the hierarchical SLLs-on-SLLs as the dependence capturing mechanism to learn the probabilistic distribution of the elements in the Environment. The idea of Transitivity builds on the Pursuit concept that injects a noise filter into the EOMA to filter divergent queries from the Environment, thereby increasing the likelihood of training the Automaton to approximate the “true” distribution of the Environment. By taking advantage of the Transitivity phenomenon based on the statistical distribution of the queried elements, we can infer “dependent” query pairs from non-accessed elements in the transitivity relation. The TPEOMA-enhanced hierarchical SLLs-on-SLLs schemes results in superior performances to the MTF and TR schemes as well as to the EOMA-enhanced hierarchical SLLs-on-SLLs schemes in NSEs. However, the results are observed to have superior performances to the PEOMA-enhanced hierarchical schemes in Environments with a Periodic non-stationary distribution but were inferior in Markovian Switching Environments.","Ekaba Bisong, O.; John Oommen, B.",Artificial Intelligence Applications and Innovations,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7256402/,141

These definitions were provided by using sequential models of computations (e.g., labeled transition systems [17, 26]), and interleaving behavioral equivalences (e.g., bisimulation equivalence [27]). More recently, the distributed model of Petri nets has been used to study non-interference in [1, 5, 6], but also in these papers an interleaving semantics was used. By exploiting a simple process algebra, called CFM [18] and equipped with a Petri net semantics, we provide some examples showing that team equivalence, a truly-concurrent behavioral equivalence proposed in [19, 20], is much more suitable to define information flow security properties. The distributed non-interference property we propose, called DNI, is very easily checkable on CFM processes, as it is compositional, so that it does not suffer from the state-space explosion problem. Moreover, DNI is characterized syntactically on CFM by means of a type system.","Gorrieri, Roberto",Application and Theory of Petri Nets and Concurrency,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7324258/,141

The archive set is generated from inferior solutions, removed from the main population, as the search process proceeds. Next, the archived solutions participate in the search during mutation step, allowing better exploration properties to be achieved. The LSHADE-RSP algorithm is taken as baseline, and 4 new update rules are proposed, including replacing the worst solution, the first found worse solution, the tournament-selected solution and individually stored solution for every solution in the population. The experiments are performed on CEC 2020 single objective optimization benchmark functions. The results are compared using statistical tests. The comparison shows that changing the update strategy significantly improves the performance of LSHADE-RSP on high-dimensional problems. The deeper analysis of the reasons of efficiency improvement reveals that new archive update strategies lead to more successful usage of the archive set. The proposed algorithms and obtained results open new possibilities of archive usage in differential evolution.","Stanovov, Vladimir; Akhmedova, Shakhnaz; Semenkin, Eugene",Advances in Swarm Intelligence,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7354773/,141

41199,The sky is the limit?! Evaluating the existence of a speculative bubble in European football,2020-10-24,"This study describes two different manifestations of Dirofilaria repens infection in sibling dogs with microfilaremia. Dog 1, asymptomatic, harbored a gravid female of D. repens on the parietal layer of tunica vaginalis of one testicle and showed a marked circulating eosinophilia (3.3·10(3)/μL). Both testicles were normal in shape and size without any gross lesions. Dog 2 had a pyotraumatic dermatitis. The cases were confirmed by PCR and sequencing. The sequences obtained showed 100% identity with those of D. repens isolated from human scrotum in Croatia. The treatment with moxidectin 2.5% and imidacloprid 10%/kg was effective in eliminating microfilariae after just one application, as demonstrated by negative modified Knott’s tests and PCR analyses of blood samples. This status was maintained during the post-treatment observation period. The classical localization of D. repens in dogs is in subcutaneous tissues, within nodules or free; however, it can also occur with some frequency in testicles, as described in humans. The infection can be associated with circulating eosinophilia or pyotraumatic dermatitis, as reported in this study. Thus, in endemic areas, it is advisable to carefully inspect the removed testicles at neutering since parasite localization can take place without any macroscopic changes. Moreover, in the case of circulating eosinophilia or pyotraumatic dermatitis, investigations should include modified Knott’s test and PCR to ensure that D. repens is not the cause of these alterations. Rapid and sensitive tests for the early detection of infected animals would help to prevent or limit the spread of this zoonosis.","Barlozzari, Giulia; Felice, Tiziana; Salvato, Laura; Conti, Raffaella; De Liberato, Claudio; Furzi, Federica; Gabrielli, Simona; Scarpulla, Manuela",Parasitol Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7574397/,141
41271,Arts majors as entrepreneurs and innovators,2020-10-27,"BACKGROUND: The opioid epidemic has enabled rapid and unsurpassed use of big data on people with opioid use disorder to design initiatives to battle the public health crisis, generally without adequate input from impacted communities. Efforts informed by big data are saving lives, yielding significant benefits. Uses of big data may also undermine public trust in government and cause other unintended harms. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to identify concerns and recommendations regarding how to use big data on opioid use in ethical ways. METHODS: We conducted focus groups and interviews in 2019 with 39 big data stakeholders (gatekeepers, researchers, patient advocates) who had interest in or knowledge of the Public Health Data Warehouse maintained by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health. RESULTS: Concerns regarding big data on opioid use are rooted in potential privacy infringements due to linkage of previously distinct data systems, increased profiling and surveillance capabilities, limitless lifespan, and lack of explicit informed consent. Also problematic is the inability of affected groups to control how big data are used, the potential of big data to increase stigmatization and discrimination of those affected despite data anonymization, and uses that ignore or perpetuate biases. Participants support big data processes that protect and respect patients and society, ensure justice, and foster patient and public trust in public institutions. Recommendations for ethical big data governance offer ways to narrow the big data divide (e.g., prioritize health equity, set off-limits topics/methods, recognize blind spots), enact shared data governance (e.g., establish community advisory boards), cultivate public trust and earn social license for big data uses (e.g., institute safeguards and other stewardship responsibilities, engage the public, communicate the greater good), and refocus ethical approaches. CONCLUSIONS: Using big data to address the opioid epidemic poses ethical concerns which, if unaddressed, may undermine its benefits. Findings can inform guidelines on how to conduct ethical big data governance and in ways that protect and respect patients and society, ensure justice, and foster patient and public trust in public institutions.","Evans, Elizabeth A.; Delorme, Elizabeth; Cyr, Karl; Goldstein, Daniel M.",BMC Med Ethics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7576981/,141

We discuss and analyze the E-Government Development Index (EGDI) reports and rankings issued by the United Nations and big data implications during the COVID-19 pandemic. We used the Origin-pro 2018 application for the analysis and discussion. Overall, China’s EGDI ranking has improved from 74 to 65 out of 193 countries, while Pakistan’s ranking has gradually declined from 137 to 148. 5G and other big data technology and e-governance implications have helped to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. In this pandemic scenario, sustainable socioeconomic development in Pakistan needs significant improvement, similar to what has been done by China. We conclude that CPEC can help combat the COVID-19 pandemic because both countries are working together to mitigate social and economic problems. Pakistan should adapt and learn from the Government of China’s experience of successful and proficient e-governance model of technological advancement. This effort will ensure successful CPEC regional extension and help combat the COVID-19 pandemic to ensure Pakistan’s sustainable development.","Ullah, Atta; Pinglu, Chen; Ullah, Saif; Abbas, Hafiz Syed Mohsin; Khan, Saba",Chin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7644414/,141

42898,The Sino-Russian partnership and global order,2020-12-08,"The results of studies on mce operons of the causative agent Mycobacterium tuberculosis and actinobacteria are summarized. Mce transporters belong to a group of cell-wall proteins. The genome of M. tuberculosis contains four mce operons that encode complexes, each of which consists of two integral membrane proteins (YrbEB) followed by six other Mce proteins (MceA–F). These proteins are functionally similar to ABC transporters. Despite their significant role in the pathogenesis of M. tuberculosis infection, Mce proteins remain poorly studied due to their complex structure and operon regulation. However, a number of their functions have been characterized; they include the penetration of host cells by M. tuberculosis and its survival, as well as the transport of cholesterol and mycolic acids, which are pathogenicity factors of no small importance. The expression of mce operons depends on many factors, such as the growth phase, the culture medium, and the localization of M. tuberculosis infection. Today, strains of M. tuberculosis and M. bovis with deleted mce operons are considered candidates for the development of new attenuated vaccines that might one day replace the M. bovis BCG vaccine, which is no longer deemed strong enough to hold back the tuberculosis epidemic.","Zaychikova, M.

COVID-19 represents a unique challenge to caregivers above and beyond the ordinary stresses they experience and many informal caregivers currently providing care have not planned for the pandemic and its effect on access to health care services, respite resources, and support groups, etc. The purpose of our study is to assess COVID-19’s impact on the mental health and wellness of informal caregivers. Method: An interdisciplinary collaborative of caregiving scholars created a 47-item web-based anonymous survey with quantitative and qualitative questions to assess caregiving experiences during COVID-19. Participants were recruited through convenience sampling using social media and flyers distributed by local/national organizations. Results: Participants (N=96) reported an average age of 50 years old and were predominately adult children caring for parents (45%) with neurological (40%) and chronic medical conditions (25%). Only 4% cared for individuals diagnosed with COVID 19. Nearly all reported significant changes in caregiving that included increased time spent caregiving for care recipients and other family members, greater stress and worry, fewer breaks for self-care, increased isolation, and decreased access to social/emotional supports and respite services. Discussion: Unplanned changes to caregiving during COVID 19 have created an acute need for research, clinical care guidelines, and policy promoting virtual respite care, social support for caregivers, and more readily available community based resources that promote caregivers’ physical and emotional wellbeing without requiring them to leave their homes.","Mata, Aaron; Mickens, Melody; Dassel, Kara; Utz, Rebecca",Innov Aging,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7741518/,141
43832,Legitimacy and Cosmopolitanism: Online Public Debates on (Corporate) Responsibility,2021-01-05,"Molten salts play multiple important roles in the electrolysis of solid metal compounds, particularly oxides and sulfides, for the extraction of metals or alloys. Some of these roles are positive in assisting the extraction of metals, such as dissolving the oxide or sulfide anions, and transporting them to the anode for discharging, and offering the high temperature to lower the kinetic barrier to break the metal-oxygen or metal-sulfur bond. However, molten salts also have unfavorable effects, including electronic conductivity and significant capability of dissolving oxygen and carbon dioxide gases. In addition, although molten salts are relatively simple in terms of composition, physical properties, and decomposition reactions at inert electrodes, in comparison with aqueous electrolytes, the high temperatures of molten salts may promote unwanted electrode-electrolyte interactions. This article reviews briefly and selectively the research and development of the Fray-Farthing-Chen (FFC) Cambridge Process in the past two decades, focusing on observations, understanding, and solutions of various interactions between molten salts and cathodes at different reduction states, including perovskitization, non-wetting of molten salts on pure metals, carbon contamination of products, formation of oxychlorides and calcium intermetallic compounds, and oxygen transfer from the air to the cathode product mediated by oxide anions in the molten salt.","Chen, George Z.",Int J Miner Metall Mater,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7772062/,141
43835,The couple business as a unique form of business: a review of the empirical evidence,2021-01-05,"Rationale: The blood-brain barrier (BBB) prevents the effective delivery of therapeutic molecules to the central nervous system (CNS). A recently generated adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based vector, AAV-PHP.eB, has been found to penetrate the BBB more efficiently than other vectors including AAV-PHP.B. However, little is known about the mechanisms. In this study, we investigated how AAV-PHP.eB penetrates the BBB in mice. Methods: We injected AAV-PHP.eB into the bloodstream of wild-type C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice as well as mouse strains carrying genetic mutation in apolipoprotein E gene (Apoe) or low-density lipoprotein receptor gene (Ldlr), or lacking various components of the immune system. Then, we evaluated AAV-PHP.eB transduction to the brain and spinal cord in these mice. Results: We found that the transduction to the CNS of intravenous AAV-PHP.eB was more efficient in C57BL/6 than BALB/c mice, and significantly reduced in Apoe or Ldlr knockout C57BL/6 mice compared to wild-type C57BL/6 mice. Moreover, poor CNS transduction in BALB/c mice was dramatically increased by B-cell or natural killer-cell depletion. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that the ApoE-LDLR pathway underlies the CNS tropism of AAV-PHP.eB and that the immune system contributes to the strain specificity of AAV-PHP.eB.","Xie, Bao-Shu; Wang, Xin; Pan, Yao-Hua; Jiang, Gan; Feng, Jun-Feng; Lin, Yong",Theranostics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7738887/,141
44156,Sustainability in a Digital Age as a Trigger for Organizational Development in Education,2020-07-15,"BACKGROUND: Health care workers are at significant risk for infection with the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: We utilized a point-of-care, lateral flow SARS-CoV-2 IgG immunoassay (RayBiotech) to conduct a seroprevalence study in a cohort of at-risk health care workers (n=339) and normal-risk controls (n=100) employed at an academic medical center. To minimize exposure risk while conducting the study, consents were performed electronically, tests were mailed and then self-administered at home using finger stick blood, and subjects uploaded a picture of the test result while answering an electronic questionnaire. We also validated the assay using de-identified serum samples from patients with PCR-proven SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: Between April 14(th) and May 6(th) 2020, 439 subjects were enrolled. Subjects were 68% female, 93% white, and most were physicians (38%) and nurses (27%). In addition, 37% had at least 1 respiratory symptom in the prior month, 34% had cared for a patient with known SARS-CoV-2 infection, 57% and 23% were worried about exposure at work or in the community, respectively, and 5 reported prior documented SARS-CoV-2 infection. On initial testing, 3 subjects had a positive IgG test, 336 had a negative test, and 87 had an inconclusive result. Of those with an inconclusive result who conducted a repeat test (85%), 96% had a negative result. All 3 positive IgG tests were in subjects reporting prior documented infection. Laboratory validation showed that of those with PCR-proven infection more than 13 days prior, 23/30 were IgG positive (76% sensitivity), whereas 1/26 with a negative prior PCR test were seropositive (95% specificity). Repeat longitudinal serologic testing every 30 days for up to 4 times is currently in progress. CONCLUSION: We conducted a contact-free study in the setting of a pandemic to assess SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in an at-risk group of health care workers. The only subjects found to be IgG positive were those with prior documented infection, even though a substantial proportion of subjects reported significant potential occupational or community exposure and symptoms that were potentially compatible with SARS-COV-2 infection.

However, few prevalence studies to date have targeted the question of asymptomatic frequency within a community. METHODS: A stratified, random sample of subjects were sent to testing sites to complete a verbal consent, survey, nasopharyngeal swab, and blood draw. Swabs were tested for active viral shedding (PCR) and blood was tested for immunoglobulin G (IgG) specific to SARS-CoV-2. Disease progression and IgG antibody response [Image: see text] RESULTS: Of the 2,640 subjects, 24 (0·9%) were PCR-positive alone, 30 (1·1%) were PCR-positive and IgG-positive, and 129 (4·9%) were IgG-positive alone. Subjects who reported anosmia were 17 times more likely to test positive. Thirty-eight percent of subjects never experienced symptoms despite developing antibodies to the virus, and 75% did not experience symptoms in the early stage of infection. Rates of reported asymptomatic infection and comorbidities statistically significantly increased with age. CONCLUSION: This is the first randomized study that pairs PCR and IgG serology that addresses asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, showing a high frequency of asymptomatic disease.

To achieve the low power/energy efficient resource allocation with mode selection, we formulate novel optimization problem with objective of maximizing the energy efficiency using the subtractive form method to solve fractional objective function and form an iterative algorithm. The formulated fractional optimization problem is transformed into min–max problem and solved by the Lagrange dual function with low transmit power, interference, data rate constraints as a lagrange multipliers via an iterative process to achieve the optimal low power. Numerical analysis exemplifies and validates the optimal low power and the energy efficient characteristics of the novel proposed algorithm with all constraints to ensure the quality of the communication for the D2D communication, 5G, and IoT applications with the industrial need of low power/energy efficient devices to promote the conservation of energy and green communication.","Pandey, Krishna; Arya, Rajeev; Kumar, Sandeep",Int J Syst Assur Eng Manag,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7794080/,141

45097,In this issue of food security - February 2021,2021-01-27,"Modern subunit vaccines based on homogeneous antigens offer more precise targeting and improved safety compared with traditional whole-pathogen vaccines. However, they are also less immunogenic and require an adjuvant to increase the immunogenicity of the antigen and potentiate the immune response. Unfortunately, few adjuvants have sufficient potency and low enough toxicity for clinical use, highlighting the urgent need for new, potent and safe adjuvants. Notably, a number of natural and synthetic carbohydrate structures have been used as adjuvants in clinical trials, and two have recently been approved in human vaccines. However, naturally derived carbohydrate adjuvants are heterogeneous, difficult to obtain and, in some cases, unstable. In addition, their molecular mechanisms of action are generally not fully understood, partly owing to the lack of tools to elucidate their immune-potentiating effects, thus hampering the rational development of optimized adjuvants. To address these challenges, modification of the natural product structure using synthetic chemistry emerges as an attractive approach to develop well-defined, improved carbohydrate-containing adjuvants and chemical probes for mechanistic investigation. This Review describes selected examples of natural and synthetic carbohydrate-based adjuvants and their application in synthetic self-adjuvanting vaccines, while also discussing current understanding of their molecular mechanisms of action.

Moreover, it analyses the mediating role of RACAP on the relationship between internal SC and product innovation. Based on a sample of companies from the Spanish biotechnological and pharmaceutical industries, two hypotheses were tested using a structural equations model and the partial least squares (PLS) technique. The results support both hypotheses, suggesting that the development of strong and tightly knit links based on a common understanding and trust among company members lead the firm to develop dynamic capabilities for transforming and exploiting knowledge acquired externally, which fosters innovation based on new product development.

Financial activities were primarily depressed, and investors were reluctant to start new financial investments while ongoing projects further declined due to the global lockdown to curb the disease. This study analyzes the money supply reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic using a cross-sectional panel of 115 countries. The study used robust least square regression and innovation accounting techniques to get sound parameter estimates. The results show that COVID-19 infected cases are the main contributing factor that obstructs financial activities and decrease money supply. In contrast, an increasing number of recovered cases and COVID-19 testing capabilities gave investors confidence to increase stock trade across countries. The overall forecast trend shows that COVID-19 infected cases and recovered cases followed the U-shaped trend, while COVID-19 critical cases and reported deaths showed a decreasing trend. Finally, the money supply and testing capacity show a positive trend over a period. The study concludes that financial development can be expanded by increasing the testing capacity and functional labs to identify suspected coronavirus cases globally.","Anser, Muhammad Khalid; Khan, Muhammad Azhar; Zaman, Khalid; Nassani, Abdelmohsen A.; Askar, Sameh E.; Abro, Muhammad Moinuddin Qazi; Kabbani, Ahmad",Financ Innov,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7845578/,141

RESULTS: The Task Force made consensus suggestions to treat patients with acute COVID-19 pneumonia with remdesivir and dexamethasone but suggested against hydroxychloroquine except in the context of a clinical trial; these are revisions of prior suggestions resulting from the interim publication of several randomised trials. It also suggested that COVID-19 patients with a venous thromboembolic event be treated with therapeutic anticoagulant therapy for 3 months. The Task Force was unable to reach sufficient agreement to yield consensus suggestions for the post-hospital care of COVID-19 survivors. The Task Force fell one vote shy of suggesting routine screening for depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder.

46479,"Accuracy of Households’ Dwelling Valuations, Housing Demand and Mortgage Decisions: Israeli Case",2021-03-06,"BACKGROUND: Patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) have experienced changes to the routine management of their conditions during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. The disease as well IBD treatment frequently require immunosuppressant medications, which could increase their risk of infection. The aim of this study was to determine patients’ experience of the health care service, including the restrictions of hospitals visits made in Norway from Mars 12th 2020. METHOD: From June 18 to September 18 2020, all patients at the IBD outpatient clinic at Oslo University Hospital in Norway on biological therapy or other immunosuppressant’s were included. A questionnaire including patients concerns regarding their disease, medical therapy and COVID-19, as well as their health care service needs in follow-up during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Altogether 506 IBD patients answered a paper-based questionnaire. The mean age was 40.78 (SD 14.71), 289/506 (57%) men, ulcerative colitis 199/506 (39%), Crohn’s disease 307/506 (61%). Sixty-three patients (12.5%) used biological therapy in combination with azathioprine or steroids. Ninety-one (18.2%) were in obligated quarantine with negative test. Five patients (4.9%) tested positive to SARS- CoV-2 of the 98 patients tested, (1.0% of the total sample). One third of the IBD patients perceived they had increased risk for being infected by SARS- CoV-2 because of the immunosuppressive drugs they used. Nonetheless, 496/506 (98.6%) of the patients adhered to continuing their medication. One-hundred and sixty-one (32.3%) voluntarily isolated, and 21/506 (4.2%) was in sick leave being afraid of being infected. Furthermore, 20/506 (4.0%) cancelled their consultation because they were afraid of being infected from SARS- CoV-2 at the hospital. The hospital changed physical consultation to telephone consultation for 75/506 (15.0%) of the patients. Thirty-eight patients (7.6%) reported that they were afraid of going to the hospital because of restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and 18/506 (3.6%) did not feel safe when at hospital. Approximately half of the IBD patients (219/506) were satisfied with the information provided by physician about medical treatment for IBD and Covid-19 while 398/506 (77.3%) were satisfied with the information from health-care providers about restrictions due to COVID-19. There were no statistical differences between Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis. CONCLUSION: IBD patients on biological treatment and immunosuppressives took precautions because of fear of being infected with SARS- CoV-2. At the same time, they adhere to medical treatment regimens and follow-up at the hospital. Most patients were satisfied with the information they received from physicians and other health-care workers. One percent tested positive to SARS-CoV-2.","Opheim, Randi; Moum, Kristian; Moum, Bjørn",Inflamm Bowel Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7928846/,141

SDN decouples the main two functions of a traditional network viz. packet switching and routing. The switch is responsible to forward packets only without any concern about routing decisions or any security checks in SDN. The control plane is responsible for routing decisions. Distributed SDN solves issues of availability and scalability, which are the weakness of a centralized or single control plane. Fault Tolerance and load balancing are the key features of any network. A brief description of our primary research goal of the proposed DCFT (Distributed Controller Fault Tolerance) model is given here. A major focus is given on a coordinator controller election algorithm to provide failsafe through load balancing in the SDN control plane. Implementation of the said algorithm verified with floodlight controller with and without a coordinator, Implementation results reveals that throughput and communication overhead will be increased with coordinator controller, packet delay (latency) will be decreased with coordinator controller.","Lakhani, Gaurang; Kothari, Amit","Computing Science, Communication and Security",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7971764/,141

In emerging applications such as social network marketing, CGPs allow to express complex search conditions and to find more sensible information than their traditional counterparts. We show that the CGPs expressivity does not come with a much higher price. Indeed, we propose a matching algorithm that is based on a revised notion of graph simulation and allows to match CGPs over any data graphs in quadratic time, as opposed to the prohibitive solutions based on subgraph isomorphism. We discuss a parallel version of our algorithm that makes it very efficient over real-life data. We investigate the satisfiability and containment problems of CGPs and we show that they are in quadratic time by providing a non-trivial checking algorithm for each one. This paper is the first effort that investigates static analysis of non-conventional graph patterns containing important features that are widely used in practice. An extensive experimental study has been conducted to show effectiveness and efficiency of our results.","Mahfoud, Houari",Pattern Recognition and Artificial Intelligence,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7972032/,141

Rejecting essentialist notions of identity, this chapter argues that sectarianism only becomes an issue when it is instrumentalized by political entrepreneurs. It examines how sectarianism has played out in Syria and Libya as well as the quest for an independent Kurdistan. The chapter explores the different approaches adopted by MENA states to manage the politics of difference. These include secessionism, federalism, consociationalism and nation-building. Various country case studies are provided as each of these approaches is assessed – from Syria and Morocco to Lebanon and Oman. Ultimately, however, the politics of identity calls upon mature political leadership with a vision and intellect to forge inclusive nation-states in an increasingly fractious region.","Solomon, Hussein; Tausch, Arno",Arab MENA Countries: Vulnerabilities and Constraints Against Democracy on the Eve of the Global COVID-19 Crisis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7972100/,141

The choice of our indicators was guided by world system (Frank, ReOrient: Global economy in the Asian Age Ewing, University of California Press, 1998) and dependency approaches to development (Bornschier et al., Transnational corporations and underdevelopment. Frederic Praeger, New York, 1985); by later globalization-oriented debates about development (Tausch, Int J Heal Plan Manag 27(1):2–33, 2012a; Tausch, International macroquantitative data.

The choice of our indicators was also guided by research on Islamism, and the issues of the way, religion, culture and values are structured in the region (Grinin et al. 2020). Our data support the perspective of the UNDP Arab Human Development Report (UNDP, Arab Human development report 2016: Youth and the prospects for human development in a changing reality. UNDP, New York. Available at http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/arab-human-development-report-2016-youth-and-prospects-human-development-changing-reality, 2016) which diagnosed that, deficient as it may be, the state-led development model in the Arab world has expanded access to key entitlements and raised some levels of human development. Arab countries had a relatively low incidence of poverty and income inequality, shielding disadvantaged groups from some of the worst economic pressures of our times. On all accounts of standard development accounting (Grinin et al., Economic cycles, crises, and the global periphery, Springer, Cham, 2016; Tausch, Int Soc Sci J 61(202):467–488, 2010; Tausch and Heshmati, Globalization, the human condition and sustainable development in the twenty-first century: Cross-national perspectives and European implications.

The multivariate indicator analysis of the development performance of the countries in the world system along seven different dimensions: Democracy. Economic growth. Environment. Gender. Human development. R&D. Social cohesion; showed that the global ranks of the Arab countries in this international comparison combining democracy, economic growth, environment, gender, human development, R&D and social cohesion ranged from rank 67 – Tunisia – to rank 167 – Sudan. Our analysis of poverty gaps in the MENA region indicates that poverty gaps exhibit two trends in the region – a secular, long-run setback and decrease of the poverty gaps, measured by the three well-known World Bank purchasing power (PPP) benchmarks of 1.90$, 3.20$, 5.50$ a day, and a lamentable short-run setback and increase of the poverty gaps during the neo-liberal transformations of the 1990s and in the wake of the Arab Spring. These setbacks in the 1990s and in the wake of the Arab Spring surely coincide with the statistics of unemployment, which closely correlates with the downswings in the economic cycle. This is especially true for the rates of youth unemployment, which reaches a staggering quarter of the entire age group. Based on the extensive development accounting data collection contained in Tausch, 2019, we also arrive in this chapter at the following and rather depressing analysis of the development deficits of the Arab world: youth disempowerment, deficits in education, high unemployment and precarious jobs, the exclusion of young women, substantial health challenges, violent radicalization, patriarchy, low social and religious tolerance, inequality of opportunity in education, the challenges facing women, the effects of social and political conservatism, problems in the health sector, war and violent conflict, a high migration pressure, the flight of human capital, all these phenomena, mentioned by the UNDP Arab Human Development Report, 2016. With the data of Barro and Ursua (Barro-Ursua macroeconomic data. Available at https://scholar.harvard.edu/barro/publications/barro-ursua-macroeconomic-data, 2011), and Barro et al. (The Coronavirus and the Great Influenza epidemic – Lessons from the ‘Spanish Flu’ for the Coronavirus’s potential effects on mortality and economic activity (2020). CESifo Working Paper No. 8166. Available at SSRN: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3556305, 2020), as well as Grinin et al. (Economic cycles, crises, and the global periphery. Springer, Cham, 2016), we deal in this chapter also with the comparative aspects and what economic science knows about the effects of both the Spanish Influenza pandemic from 1918 onwards and the Great Depression from 1929 onwards. Poor countries like Egypt recovered their income levels from pre-Great Depression levels only in the late 1950s. Based on the empirical relationship between income levels and pandemic fatality rates 1918–1920, we can assume that if the current pandemic repeats the patterns of the Spanish influenza, 1918–1920, fatality rates in the Arab world will be 1–2 percent in the United Arab Emirates, Jordan, Egypt, Tunisia, Kuwait, Morocco and >2 percent in Qatar, Yemen , Sudan, Mauritania and Comoros. Finally, we risk a prognosis on the overall societal effects of the pandemic. There will be rising income inequality over time. And the severity of the epidemic negatively influences international income convergence over time. With the majority of the populations in the Arab world predictably becoming poorer still by international standards after the pandemic, and with income inequality predictably rising, we should finally look at another lesson of history, which might be deduced from the Barro and Ursua (Barro-Ursua macroeconomic data. Available at https://scholar.harvard.edu/barro/publications/barro-ursua-macroeconomic-data, 2011) data. In the United Kingdom, it took practically a decade to recover the pre-pandemic income levels, and in Italy, the crisis was even more severe, and Italian democracy collapsed and Benito Mussolini rose to power in 1922.","Solomon, Hussein; Tausch, Arno",Arab MENA Countries: Vulnerabilities and Constraints Against Democracy on the Eve of the Global COVID-19 Crisis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7972126/,141

Design/Methodology/Approach: The authors used the scientific works of Russian and foreign scholars specializing in Chinese investment. In carrying out the study, systematic and historical approaches were used to study the trends of Chinese FDI in the EU. Furthermore, statistical, logical and visualization methods were also incorporated. Findings: It is shown that if initially Chinese investors invested in almost all the industries and sectors in which they were interested in, ranging from the extractive industry to the entertainment industry (e.g. purchase of sports clubs), nowadays Chinese investment policy has become more specialized only in some sectors. Today, China is primarily interested in high-tech industries. As a result, the main goal of Chinese investors is to acquire leading European and American companies engaged in these industries. Chinese investors are supported by the government and the “Made in China 2025” strategy is being fully implemented. One of the key objectives of this strategy is China’s global dominance in technology. Over the last four years Chinese investors made around 30 transactions in high-tech sector in the EU countries. As a result, China has been given access to critical technology that can lead to increase China’s role in global technology market. Originality/Value: The authors describe the current trends of the Chinese investment policy in the technology, analyze the largest Chinese mergers and acquisitions in this sector and draw conclusions about those high-tech sectors in which China is most interested today. On the one hand, Foreign direct investment in the high-tech sector contributes to the development of technology in China, and on the other hand, leads to the loss of the position of European companies in the global technology market.","Andronova, Inna V.; Sokolan, Daria S.; Fedyakina, Lora N.",Modern Global Economic System: Evolutional Development vs,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7972277/,141

The case study discussed in this paper, therefore, sets out to identify the main areas that schools of arts and design could engage with in order to become active players in digital transformation. It does so by conducting both, a series of qualitative interviews as well as an online survey that reached out to representants of the design and arts community at Lucerne School of Applied Sciences and across Europe. Initially, this sample was meant to be compared to a sample originating from the computer science community. Due to the lockdown of European Universities caused by the CoVid-19 crisis, this second part of the study had to be postponed. Instead, the paper completes the findings of the qualitative study conducted in the design and arts community with a series of observations made during the sudden shift to remote and e-learning at our own university of Applied Sciences and Arts.

These methodological innovations led to the conception of network-based data maps oriented to highlight urban scale road-circulation networks configurational properties, that supported comparative studies regarding cities’ morphologies and their representation as complex systems. However, significant hindrances persist for the construction of very large road-circulation network datasets, such as those suitable to regional and supra-regional scale analyses. Owing to their sheer sizes, modelling these expanses require extensive processing times, which impact on research prospects. Data precision is a concern as well, since generalization processes, whereas can reduce computing complexity, oftentimes render comparisons amongst different scales inaccurate, due to certain road structures non-representation. Research requirements for a comparable and accurate multiscale database, suited to evaluate circulation networks configurational properties of centrality, prompted construction of the Tuscany Configurational Atlas as an experiment. Intended as a set of GIS-based digital thematic maps and data repository, it depicts closeness and betweenness centralities hierarchies of the Tuscan Region road-infrastructure in regional, provincial and municipality scales.

48440,The Online Attention Game for Digital Identity Education: An Exploratory Study,2021-03-19,"Direct marketing enables businesses to identify customers that could be interested in product offerings based on historical customer transactions data. Several machine learning (ML) tools are currently being used for direct marketing. However, the disadvantage of ML algorithmic models is that even though results could be accurate, they lack relevant explanations. The lack of detailed explanations that justify recommendations has led to reduced trust in ML-based recommendations for decision making in some critical real-world domains. The telecommunication domain has continued to witness a decline of revenue in core areas such as voice and text messaging services which make direct marketing useful to increase profit. This paper presents the conceptual design of a machine learning process framework that will enable telecom subscribers that should be targeted for direct marketing of new products to be identified, and also provide explanations for the recommendations. To do this, a hybrid framework that employs supervised learning, case-based reasoning and rule-based reasoning is proposed. The operational workflow of the framework is demonstrated with an example, while the plan of implementation and evaluation are also discussed.","Petersen, Russel; Daramola, Olawande",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7974965/,141

Optimization methods for machine learning include gradient descent, simulated annealing, genetic algorithm and second order techniques like Newton’s method. However, the popular method for optimizing neural networks is gradient descent. Overtime, researchers have made gradient descent more responsive to the requirements of improved quality loss (accuracy) and reduced training time by progressing from using simple learning rate to using adaptive moment estimation technique for parameter tuning. In this work, we investigate the performances of established stochastic gradient descent algorithms like Adam, RMSProp, Adagrad, and Adadelta in terms of training time and loss quality. We show practically, using series of stochastic experiments, that adaptive moment estimation has improved the gradient descent optimization method. Based on the empirical outcomes, we recommend further improvement of the method by using higher moments of gradient for parameter tuning (weight update). The output of our experiments also indicate that neural network is a stochastic algorithm.","Okewu, Emmanuel; Misra, Sanjay; Lius, Fernandez-Sanz",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7974985/,141

Additionally, their low immune status is associated with dental caries. However, little is known about how their dental caries and related risk factors, such as salivary flow, salivary pH level and oral health-related quality of life, differ from those of HIV-negative children. The study aimed to assess (1) dental caries and related risk factors in HIV-positive compared with HIV-negative children and (2) the association between these factors and HIV seropositive status in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study conducted as a baseline survey of a randomised controlled trial. The study setting was the National Pediatric Hospital’s catchment area. The study population comprised 328 HIV-positive and 154 HIV-negative children aged 3–15 years and their caregivers. We collected clinical oral health data, questionnaire data to assess oral health-related quality of life and growth data. RESULTS: The mean number of decayed, missing or filled permanent teeth (DMFT) and deciduous teeth (dmft) among HIV-positive children was 4.0 (SD 3.6) and 7.0 (SD 4.9), respectively. Among HIV-negative children, the respective values were 3.3 (SD 3.7) and 7.1 (SD 4.6). Living with HIV was positively associated with DMFT (adjusted OR 1.85, 95% CI 1.14 to 3.01) and salivary flow (β=0.72, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.00) and negatively associated with salivary pH (β=−0.13, 95% CI −0.24 to –0.02). However, HIV-positive status was not significantly associated with dmft or oral health-related quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: HIV-positive children had poorer oral health status regarding DMFT and salivary pH level. Specific strategies and further efforts are required to align their oral health status with that of HIV-negative children.","Kikuchi, Kimiyo; Yi, Siyan; Yasuoka, Junko; Tuot, Sovannary; Okawa, Sumiyo; Murayama, Makoto; Yem, Sokunthea; Chhoun, Pheak; Eng, Sothearith; Huot, Chantheany; Morokuma, Seiichi",BMJ Paediatr Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7957132/,141

Challenges to this paradigm include evidence that leaving can increase danger, at least in the short term, and the fact that mainstream solutions associated with leaving have historically ill-served victims marginalized by race, gender identity, disability, language, or immigration status. Nonetheless, leaving remains a primary focus of planning for safety from an abusive partner. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in home quarantine, the shutdown of courts that most often hear abuse cases, slowdowns in obtaining orders of protection due to remote access being inconsistent, and domestic violence shelters that cannot accept new residents, while practicing adequate social distancing and protective health measures. COVID-19 has forced domestic violence advocates to grapple with safety options other than leaving.

For example, they often enforce strict syntax for test cases, like the “Given-When-Then” format, which may not always be easy to write for a given test case. A new test automation framework named Gauge (gauge.org) addresses that limitation since it does not prescribe the BDD testing process with a strict syntax. In Gauge, writing a test case is as easy as writing down the flow of test cases in several itemized sentences in a natural language, like English. In the context of Testinium (testinium.com), a large software testing company which provides software testing services, tools and solutions to a large number of clients, we have actively used the Gauge framework since 2018 to develop large automated front-end test suites for several large web applications. In this paper/talk, the speakers will share several examples and best practices of developing automated tests in natural-language requirements using the Gauge framework.

Social work practices should be more inclusive of the natural environment in the person-in-environment framework. Ecosocial work addresses the importance of the natural environment in social work practice. Interventions for engaging the natural environment in social work practice are explored. Connecting to the natural environment can be beneficial for personal and professional growth. The COVID-19 pandemic is a crisis that has provided time for reflection to reassess our relationship to nature. Social workers have the opportunity to incorporate biophilia and deep ecology for personal and professional growth. Moving forward to a post-pandemic world, recommendations to further engage with nature, particularly in urban settings, are considered.","Willoughby, Michelle","Shared Trauma, Shared Resilience During a Pandemic",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7978528/,141

Workers with unstable jobs prior to the crisis, have been affected hardest due to the loss of work and income (Börner, 2020). An example is the group of workers who cannot make ends meet, despite having a job. In order to explore the impact of the coronavirus crisis on in-work poverty, it is relevant to get a better insight into how low income is defined because in the Netherlands low income and poverty are calculated in various ways. For this chapter we use two indicators (Statistics Netherlands, 2018; SCP, 2018). The first is the poverty threshold, indicating whether or not the income is sufficient to meet basic needs such as buying food, housing, and participating in social activities. The second is the low-income threshold, representing stable purchasing power over time.","Bekker, Sonja; Buerkert, Johanna; Quirijns, Quirine; Pop, Ioana",The New Common,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7978670/,141

49146,Dynamic Sustainability: Back to History to Advocate for Small- and Medium-Sized Towns,2020-10-16,"Patient registration is an essential process in every clinic and hospital before services are provided to patients. Usually, patient’s identity card or fingerprint (through a fingerprint scanner) will be requested for identity authentication in order to retrieve medical records of the patient. However, the current global health crisis of COVID-19 pandemic is raising concern on the hygiene and safety of sharing objects or touching surfaces. Same worry is also occurred towards the patient registration interaction process; further, hospitals and clinics are classified as high risk premises. Therefore, a contactless patient authentication for registration using face recognition technology is proposed in this work. In this system, a face is scanned and processed. If the face exists in the database indicating that the subject is an established patient, the patient’s records will be retrieved. Else, a new patient registration will be performed to register a new account. The efficiency of the system is assessed using our self-collected database. Empirical results show that the proposed system is able to attain 94% accuracy. But, an inferior performance is obtained, especially dealing with makeup variation.","Tay, Kian Yang; Pang, Ying Han; Ooi, Shih Yin; Goh, Fan Ling",Computational Science and Technology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7979048/,141

We have mainly two problems with how these three phenomena are conceptualized. First of all, while they are often discussed in relation to each other, it is often not clear what these concepts are examples of. It is sometimes argued that all of them are examples of misleading content online. This is quite a one-sided picture, as it excludes the vast amount of content online, namely when these techniques are used for memes, satire and parody, which is part of the foundation of today’s online culture. Second of all, because of this conceptual confusion, much research and practice is focusing on how to prevent and detect audiovisual media content that has been tampered with, either manually or through the use of AI. This has recently led to a ban on deepfaked content on Facebook. However, we argue that this does not address problems related to the spread of misinformation. Instead of targeting the source of the problem, such initiatives merely target one of its symptoms. The main contribution of this paper is a typology of what we term Intentionally Inaccurate Representations of Reality (IIRR) in media content. In contrast to deepfakes, cheapfakes and fake news – terms with mainly negative connotations – this term emphasizes both sides; the creative and fun, and the malicious use of AI and non-AI powered editing techniques.","Davis, Matthew J.; Fors, Per",Human-Centric Computing in a Data-Driven Society,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7979132/,141

In direct detection experiments, the parameter space of millicharged particles can be constrained from the atomic ionization process. In this work, we develop the relativistic impulse approximation (RIA) approach, which can duel with atomic many-body effects effectively, in the atomic ionization process induced by millicharged particles. The formulation of RIA in the atomic ionization induced by millicharged particles is derived, and the numerical calculations are obtained and compared with those from free electron approximation and equivalent photon approximation. Concretely, the atomic ionizations induced by mllicharged dark matter particles and millicharged neutrinos in high-purity germanium (HPGe) and liquid xenon (LXe) detectors are carefully studied in this work. The differential cross sections, reaction event rates in HPGe and LXe detectors, and detecting sensitivities on dark matter particle and neutrino millicharge in next-generation HPGe and LXe based experiments are estimated and calculated to give a comprehensive study. Our results suggested that the next-generation experiments would improve 2-3 orders of magnitude on dark matter particle millicharge δ(χ) than the current best experimental bounds in direct detection experiments. Furthermore, the next-generation experiments would also improve 2-3 times on neutrino millicharge δ(ν) than the current experimental bounds.","Qiao, Chen-Kai; Lin, Shin-Ted; Chi, Hsin-Chang; Jia, Hai-Tao",J High Energy Phys,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7980100/,141

These lockdowns have confined people at their homes which is leading them to use digital technologies such as Internet, social media, smartphones, more than ever before. The problematic use of these digital technologies may impact their mental and emotional health. This chapter discusses the role of machine learning to assess addiction to various digital technologies and its impact on mental and emotion health and on sleep quality during the COVID-19 pandemic. Three case studies are provided to demonstrate how machine learning can be used to assess these addictions and related disorders during the pandemic. Gaussian mixture clustering is implemented to group people with similar Twitter usage patterns to identify addictive Twitter usage during the pandemic. The results convey that 11.71% of users show addictive Twitter usage patterns and 4.05% of users show highly addictive Twitter usage patterns while 2.70% of users show dangerously addictive usage patterns. “Sadness” and “anger” are the dominating emotions among these users in contrast to “happiness” which is the dominating emotion among non-addictive users. A similar approach is used to cluster students with similar smartphone usage patterns and nomophobia scores to identify nomophobic behavior during the pandemic. The results show that 4.5% of students are at extremely high risk whereas 73% of students are at high risk. A review of studies identifies the emergence of machine learning for assessment of mental and emotional health during the COVID-19 pandemic. A case study on sleep quality assessment using data from wearable sensors convey that sleep quality of students has been reduced significantly during the pandemic with a maximum decrease of 90.90%.","Arora, Anshika; Chakraborty, Pinaki; Bhatia, M.

It is revealed that migrants were going toward high developed states from the low developed states during the pre-pandemic situation. However, the pandemic shock changed the direction of migration; a reverse migration was witnessed toward their native places. This chapter brings to fore the forces of detracton at the Indian megacities, which acted as the push factors; the challenging phase of transit from cities to native villages; and the graved scenario of social stigmatization over migrants workforce in their “homeland.”","Hembram, Rupai; Garai, Uttam",COVID-19 Pandemic Trajectory in the Developing World,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7981502/,141

Some of such problems in the transport sector include congestion, carbon emissions, and inadequate public transit service supply. One probable solution to these can be through optimum utilization of disruptive mobility, which has hit this sector like a storm. This chapter presents the scenario of App-Based Shared Mobility (ABSM) services in the city of Bengaluru and the consequent impact it is creating on the urban travel trends, travel behavior, and car ownership. These services generate city-level data, which can be utilized to judge various aspects of city-wide traffic to improve the overall mobility. Moreover, the change in consumer desire from ownership to the accessibility of goods and services has penetrated the transport sector in the form of Transport Network Companies (TNCs), which has great potential to impact the public transit ridership as well as private vehicle ownership which is further explored in the chapter.","Akhtar, Nausheen; Kuriakose, Paulose N.",The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Green Societies,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7984824/,141

50401,Introductory Chapter,2020-08-19,"This chapter explores the potential and limitations of Social Accounting, a much relevant discussion in the context of a book about Ethics in Finance. This chapter intends to introduce some of the ongoing discussions around Social Accounting to scholars from other disciplines. There is no intention of presenting an exhaustive picture of Social Accounting, and the choice of literature has been narrowed to those issues more relevant for Ethics in Finance. The chapter presents a short introduction to Social Accounting and its recent history. Then, there is an exploration of five issues that may interest a general academic audience: first, the reasons and purpose of corporate disclosure of social and environmental information, being that this kind of disclosure is usually not mandatory; second, the current discussion about regulation in this field, whether regulation of Social Accounting contributes to Sustainability or not; third, an introduction to the use of Social Accounting for internal purposes, that is, information not disclosed to external parties but used instead by management for decision-making; fourth, the link between Social Accounting and financial performance; and finally, the promise of Social Accounting to contribute to Sustainability. Some of the main ideas are as follows. There is a tension between companies, which possibly do not share all social and environmental information, and stakeholders, who would expect higher transparency. Thus, we should not assume that companies naively disclose social and environmental information. Then, regulation for social reports could help to increase the quality of reports, but some studies show that regulation by itself will not automatically improve disclosure. Additionally, studies in managerial accounting emphasize the complexity of working with social and environmental indicators. Thus, it is possible that managers struggle to collect and make sense of information about all the social and environmental impacts of their firm. Furthermore, the link between sustainability and financial performance remains elusive. Finally, we should be aware of what Social Accounting can deliver (and what it cannot do) in terms of organizational change. Consequently, practitioners should not refrain from using complementary tools from other disciplines. Overall, Social Accounting can contribute in a consistent way to the improvement of corporate sustainability. In that sense, Social Accounting is an increasingly important tool for both managers and stakeholders.","Zicari, Adrian",Handbook on Ethics in Finance,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7990653/,141
50414,"Monetary, Fiscal, and Structural Policy in the European and Greek Economy",2020-08-19,"Women today are bombarded with images representing bodily perfection. Whilst women appear to be, and are, taking positions in trades and professions that women have held more rarely, if at all, in the past, women’s bodies rather than women’s brains feature centre stage in popular media. Yet as Jocelynne Scutt points out, women have ever been complex beings, not only artists’ muses, but artists themselves. Women are artisans, inventors, creative contributors, hard working inside and outside the home, defying Dr Johnson’s misogynist proposition that a woman speaking from a public platform is akin to a dog’s walking upright, on its hindlegs. Nonetheless, in the twenty-first century the proposition that, for women, body is all has peaked. Aesthetic, cosmetic and plastic surgery and procedures purporting to beautify women, whilst making them ‘normal’ or ‘more natural’, invade women’s bodies. Commentators assert that women exercise complete autonomy and untrammelled agency in choosing these methods to make their bodies into what they want them to be or believe they should be. Critics argue that women’s vanity and narcissism propel them into the surgery or salon. Others contend that all women want is to ‘fit in’. Covid-19 and Zoom meetings create an upsurge in ‘procedures’, teeth whitening and facelifts. Meanwhile, body dysmorphic disorder (BDD)—a psychological condition whereby the woman sees her body not as it is, but ugly as she believes it to be—hovers. Reflecting upon these possibilities, Jocelynne Scutt asks whether the changes to which women’s bodies are subjected are intruding so deeply into women’s psyche and the way we exist in the world, that in a pervasively plastic realm, women risk the danger of losing touch with the reality of who we are.","Scutt, Jocelynne A.","Beauty, Women's Bodies and the Law",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7990667/,141

This study assesses anxiety symptoms of the drug users undergoing CDT and explores the associated factors. A cross-sectional study with cluster sampling was conducted in three cities in Liaoning Province of Northeast China. Nine hundred CDT drug users were interviewed face-to-face with Chinese questionnaires. Hierarchical multiple regression (HMR) analysis was conducted to explore the factors associated with anxiety symptoms. The prevalence of anxiety symptoms among the CDT drug users was substantially high (33.2%). HMR analysis indicated perceived stress and characteristics of drug use such as types of drugs, were the most important contributors to anxiety symptoms. Optimism (LOT-R) played a protective role in reducing anxiety symptoms in this population. Anxiety symptoms of drug users undergoing CDT were present in a significant proportion of the CDT population. Optimism is a protective factor which could attenuate the detrimental effects of perceived stress on anxiety symptoms and potentially improve treatment outcomes.","Yang, Xiaoshi; Kovarik, Carrie; Wang, Yuke; Yu, Shenshui",Front Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7990875/,141

Foundational reasons for this to occur are considered, from self-deprecation to lack of mentorship, and from excessive competition among one another to relational aggression. The chapter dives into a phenomenon that has been addressed in a different light, but potentially not made entirely clear before: the fact that women oftentimes advocate men in leadership positions. Several reasons for this to be the case are discussed. The chapter next introduces the acronym “WOMEN UNITE” to serve as a support system for women who are eager to restore the leadership balance, and doing so in a consciously and morally responsible way. The elements of this acronym are: Walk your talk; Open your heart; Motivate others; Express your appreciation; Nurture constructive habits; Understand differences; Navigate the path from here onward; Instill values into actions; Tread gently; Excel where it matters.","Marques, Joan; Coffman, Mercedes",Exploring Gender at Work,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7991118/,141

For years I found it difficult to come to peaceful terms with the different roles that I play, that of being a pricing consultant on the one hand and that of being a consumer on the other. Along the way, I also came to understand that finding the right price is of vital importance for any going concern. Price underpins a firm’s strategy as to what customer segments the firm is addressing. Ultimately, the price, not the cost, determines the prospects of a firm.

However, technology is costly, subject to failure and can also impede care provision and cause issues such as being more time consuming, changing working relationships, roles and responsibilities. As a result, the chapter considers the human resource development implications in operationalising technological innovations in care comprising careful and well-communicated implementation; systematic integration into work practices, taking account of revised roles and responsibilities; addressing user anxieties and ensuring provision of training and development activities which reflect changing skills and competencies.","Oldridge, Louise","The Future of HRD, Volume I",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7991219/,141

However, the effectiveness of current established diet therapies is suboptimal. The patatin‐like phospholipase domain containing 3 (PNPLA3) gene modifies disease outcome and hepatic lipid handling, but the role of PNPLA3 variants in modulating responsiveness to different diet therapies is unknown. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This project aims to assess the feasibility of conducting a genotype-driven randomised controlled trial (RCT) investigating the differential response to a Mediterranean diet (MD) intervention of NAFLD patients according to genotype for the rs738409 (I148M) variant of PNPLA3. A single-centre randomised controlled feasibility trial will be undertaken. We will recruit 60 adults with NAFLD from a tertiary hepatology centre in England. In a cross-over design, participants will undertake Diet 1 (MD) and Diet 2 (control) for 4 weeks, in random order (1:1 allocation), separated by a 4 weeks washout period. Participants will complete one-to-one diet and lifestyle consultations at baseline, end of diet phase 1, end of washout and end of diet phase 2. Participants will be advised to maintain baseline levels of physical activity and body weight. The primary outcome is the acceptability and feasibility of the intervention protocol. Secondary outcomes include exploratory assessment of liver fibrosis biomarkers and lipid biomarkers. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval was granted by East of Scotland Research Ethics Service REC 1 (19/ES/0112). Results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journals and presented at local, national and international meetings and conferences.

The partitioning of the experimental data is performed by interval type-2 fuzzy Gustafson–Kessel clustering algorithm. The interval Kalman gains in the consequent proposition of interval type-2 fuzzy Kalman filter are updated according to unobservable components computed by recursive spectral decomposition of experimental data.

On the contrary, the prevalence in COVID patients of diseases of the adrenal glands has not been reported. Since the visualization of the adrenal glands is almost always available in chest CT performed in patients with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, the evaluation of the frequency and characteristics of morphological disorders of the adrenal masses in such patients appears of interest. We carried out a prospective consecutive series of 402 patients (M 222, 55.2%; F 180, 44.8%) with a median age of 76 years (IQR 64–84 years), admitted in the emergency department for suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. One hundred patients had a PCR-confirmed diagnosis of infection on a naso-pharyngeal swab (24.9%). All patients underwent a chest MDCT study including the adrenal region and clinical assessment of co-morbidities. Compared to subjects without confirmed disease, COVID patients had more frequently close contact with other positive subjects (24% vs 4.6%, p <0.001), typical symptoms (68% vs 28.5%, p <0.001), and suggestive chest CT findings (90% vs 31.1%, p <0.001). We found altered adrenal morphology in 100 patients (24.9%): 62 subjects had adrenal hyperplasia, which was unilateral in 42 of them (67.7%) and bilateral in 20 (32.3%), while 38 patients had discrete adrenal nodules, unilateral in 34 of them (89.4%) and bilateral in 4 (10.6%). The median size of adrenal nodules was 16 mm (10–50 mm) with a median density of 10 HU (-41 - 42 HU). In 17 patients with adrenal hyperplasia, a previous CT was available for comparison: in all cases an increase in thickness was evident at admission (from 1 to 15 mm, with a median of 1.95 mm increase). COVID patients had a higher frequency of adrenal nodules (12% vs 8.6%, p=NS). Sixty-three patients (16%) died. They were older (80 vs 74 years, p = 0.001), had a higher frequency of adrenal hyperplasia (25% vs 14%, p = 0.03), more frequent active cancer disease (37% vs 19%, p = 0.003) and COVID (23% vs 13.2%, p = 0.02). In a multivariate model, adrenal hyperplasia is an independent risk factor for mortality (OR 2.52, 1.15–5.55, p=0.02), as well as age (OR 1.04, 1.01–1.07, p=0.005), active oncological disease (OR 3.06, 1.44–6.49, p=0.004), and COVID (OR 2.88, 1.38–6.01, p=0.005). This is the first study reporting the prevalence of morphological alterations of adrenal glands in suspected COVID patients. The frequency of discrete adrenal nodules (9.5%) is in line with the high prevalence of adrenal incidentalomas in elder subjects. The high frequency of adrenal hyperplasia associated with increased risk of mortality suggests that this may be the consequence of an exaggerated activation of the HPA axis due to a highly stressful condition.","Reimondo, Giuseppe; Solitro, Federica; Puglisi, Soraya; Casale, Davide; Tiranti, Giorgio Maria; Perini, Anna; Cultrera, Alessandra; Pia, Anna; Terzolo, Massimo; Veltri, Andrea",J Endocr Soc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8089623/,141

This has led to the development of subscription-based online platforms for mathematics learning, available for purchase by schools and individuals. Currently, research in mathematics education tends to focus on the benefits to teaching and learning of digital technologies, while less attention is given to the use of commercial applications in mathematics, and to the rationale of schools in choosing these resources, or to consideration of how they might fundamentally change the shape of mathematics education in our schools. This paper reports on a survey sent to mathematics leaders of all schools in Aotearoa New Zealand, attaining a 24% response rate. Schools appeared to provide a great variety of learning experiences in mathematics, including the use of online programs. Many different online programs were utilised by schools, and the majority of these operate for business profit within state-funded school systems. The theoretical construct of ‘figured worlds’ was used to understand the school leaders’ rationales for using the programs. Leaders gave contrasting and conflicting reasons for their choices: discourses of neoliberalism, reform teaching, traditionalism and Ed-tech were all evident in their responses. The survey results suggest that in this era of market competition, schools face pressure to provide mathematics programmes that are simultaneously traditional, modern, high-tech and balanced.","Darragh, Lisa; Franke, Nike",Math Ed Res J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8099534/,141

Acharya: Quest for restoring financial stability in India,2021-05-21,"INTRODUCTION: During the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic, appendicitis was managed conservatively to reduce peri-operative mortality; spread of infection; and hospital admissions. We describe the outcomes observed from conservative management during the pandemic. METHOD: This prospective single centre study included all patients with clinically acute appendicitis between 31/3/2020 to 31/5/2020. Length of admission and 30-day complications were recorded. This was compared to retrospective data from 31/3/2019 to 31/4/2019. RESULTS: Of the 35 patients included between 31/3/2020 to 31/5/2020: 19 patients were managed conservatively with antibiotics; 8 required operative management after trial of antibiotics; and 8 required surgery on admission. Of the initially conservatively managed patients, three suffered complications (Clavien Dindo >1). Length of admission in conservative patients averaged 1.3 days (0-5 day range). In May 2019, 30 patients admitted with clinical appendicitis were all managed with appendicectomy. The average admission was 2.93 days (1-50 day range) with 4 patient complications.

53460,Innovation and diversity in the digital cultural and creative industries,2021-05-22,"INTRODUCTION: The coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) has presented orthopaedic services with new challenges across all aspects of healthcare delivery. This study explores the effect of the COVID-19 lockdown on trauma admissions at a London District General Hospital. METHOD: Data was collected retrospectively from electronic patient records during the lockdown period (16(th) March -30(th)April 2020) and compared to the same dates in 2019. Patient age, date and time of admission, operation and anaesthesia timings and length of stay (LOS) were analysed. RESULTS: Fewer trauma patients were admitted in 2020 (108 vs. 65). Additionally, there was a patient demographics shift, with mean age increasing from 55.6 years to 64.1 years (p = 0.038). Falls remained the leading cause of injury, although the proportion dropped from 75% to 62%. Anaesthesia duration was longer in 2020 (136 vs 83 minutes, p < 0.00001). Similarly, there was a 13.6% increase in median operation length. Finally, although LOS was similar, admission-operation was greatly reduced in 2020 (1.22 days vs 4.74, p < 0.0000001). CONCLUSIONS: Orthopaedic trauma care remains a vital service, particularly in high-volume hospitals. By understanding the effects of the lockdown on trauma admissions, healthcare managers can more effectively plan for future changes in non-emergent trauma service delivery as we move towards easing lockdown restrictions.","Zahoor, U; Malik, C; Raja, H; Ramaraju, S; Sri-Ram, K",Br J Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8135889/,141

Understanding heterogeneity among exit routes,2021-05-25,"INTRODUCTION: Biliary pathology creates a significant burden on the NHS in terms of acute admissions, investigative imaging and elective operating. During the COVID-19 pandemic, surgical services were adapted to minimise hospital admissions. Our aim is to review the safety and efficacy of the surgical ambulatory service in the management of varying biliary pathology. METHOD: Data was retrospectively collected on consecutive patients referred to the surgical team with presumed biliary pathology between 30(th) April and 16(th) August 2020. Patients with presumed cholecystitis were discharged with oral antibiotics following local guidance with follow-up telephone consultations. Unsuccessful ambulation was determined by representation at 30 days. RESULTS: One-hundred-and-seventy patients were referred to the acute surgical team with presumed biliary pathology; 81 were suitable for ambulatory management and their first line imaging (abdominal ultrasound, MRCP or CT) was performed within a median of 4 days; 17% of these patients underwent second line imaging in the form of MRCP. Fourteen percent of these patients failed ambulatory management and were admitted to hospital; 3 underwent a cholecystectomy and 2 had an ERCP. CONCLUSIONS: Patients presenting with biliary disease can be safely managed in an ambulatory setting. Access to imaging early can facilitate successful discharge and ongoing ambulatory investigation and definitive management.","Lockhart, J; Deeny, D; Armstrong, L",Br J Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8135947/,141

Main funding source(s): College of Physiotherapists of Catalonia INTRODUCTION: At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, all over Europe imposed population lockdowns. In our country, the government approved a nationwide confinement from March 14 to April 12, which restricted the movement of people to a very specific schedule. The lockdown was then relaxed, but remained in place until June 7. Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is a class I level A recommendation with clinical benefits that are now well documented. The COVID-19 lockdown made it particularly difficult to achieve the goals of CR, that is, the maintenance of physical exercise and the control of cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF) in cardiac patients. Little is known about its effects on phase III of CR program (CRP). PURPOSE: To assess the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown on physical activity and on the adherence to a cardio-healthy lifestyle in post-acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients. METHODS: A nested cross-sectional substudy of all patients included in a randomised clinical trial before the lockdown by means of a telephone survey during the month of May. We are conducting a randomized clinical trial to assess the efficacy of a phase III CRP, based on counselling in the maintenance of physical exercise (time of physical exercise per week) and on reinforcing the control of CVRF for patients with ACS, once the hospital-supervised physical exercise program of a phase II CRP had been completed. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients were included. Mean age was 60.3 (SD 10.1) and 81.3% were men. Related to baseline, no statistically significant differences were observed between groups. One patient (3.1%) had symptoms of COVID-19. The lockdown altered the dynamics of physical exercise in 21 patients (65.6%), 20 of whom (95.2%) reported taking fewer minutes of exercise per week. After the end of the lockdown period and outdoor physical exercise was allowed once again, 11 patients (55.0%) in the control group and 9 patients (75.0%) in the intervention group found it easy to restart physical exercise. With regard to nutrition, most patients (78.1%) followed the recommendations to eat a Mediterranean diet. Five (15.6%) modified their alcohol consumption, and three smokers (33.3%) modified their tobacco consumption. When asked about their mood during the lockdown, 22 (68.8%) reported feeling well. Finally, 96.9% of patients adhered to medical treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The lockdown reduced the level of physical activity but more intervention group patients resumed recommended physical activity. The COVID-19 pandemic is likely to result in care disruptions of varying degrees in the near future. To counteract the damaging effects of giving up physical exercise, health professionals should stay in contact with patients to motivate them to take physical exercise and encourage them to perform indoor exercise-based personalized programs to keep up the amount of exercise they take each week.","Santaularia, N; Arnau, A; Tora, N; Ramirez-Morros, A; Vazquez-Oliva, G",Eur J Prev Cardiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8136080/,141

However, progress in oligonucleotide-based therapeutics has been limited by the difficulty in delivering these complex molecules to their sites of action in the cytosol or nucleus of cells within specific tissues. There are two aspects to the delivery problem. The first is that most types of oligonucleotides have poor uptake into non-hepatic tissues. The second is that much of the oligonucleotide that is taken up by cells is entrapped in endosomes where it is pharmacologically inert. It has become increasingly recognized that endosomal trapping is a key constraint on oligonucleotide therapeutics. Thus, many approaches have been devised to address this problem, primarily ones based on various nanoparticle technologies. However, recently an alternative approach has emerged that employs small molecules to manipulate intracellular trafficking processes so as to enhance oligonucleotide actions. This review presents the current status of this chemical biology approach to oligonucleotide delivery and seeks to point out possible paths for future development.","Juliano, Rudolph L.",Biomedicines,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8148136/,141

The present study was conducted in Thessaly, Greece and aimed to identify risk and environmental factors associated with CPV-2 infection in diarrheic dogs. Fecal samples were collected from 116 dogs presenting diarrhea and were tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the presence of CPV-2 DNA. Supplementary data regarding clinical symptoms, individual features, management factors and medical history were also gathered for each animal during clinical evaluation. Sixty-eight diarrheic dogs were found to be positive for the virus DNA in their feces. Statistical analysis revealed that CPV-2 DNA was less likely to be detected in senior dogs, while working dogs, namely hounds and shepherds, had higher odds to be positive for the virus. Livestock density and land uses, specifically the categories of discontinuous urban fabric and of human population density, were identified as significant environmental parameters associated with CPV-2 infection by using Geographical Information System (GIS) together with the Ecological Niche Model (ENM).

Patients with severe forms of Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) treated with biologic therapy are considered to be at increased risk of infectious diseases due to the immunosuppressive effect of biologic drugs. Available guidelines recommend that biologic therapy is continued during the pandemic. Since data on COVID 19 infection in this subgroup of IBD patients is limited we aimed to assess presence of risk factors related to virus transmission, incidence and severity of COVID 19 infection in patients on biologic therapy in tertiary center in Serbia. METHODS: Study was conducted in Clinic for Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Clinical center of Serbia. We included 263 IBD patients on biologic therapy in the study (mean age 41±13, 142 males). There were 162 CD and 101 UC patients. Standardized questionnaire was used to assess presence of different risk factors relevant for virus transmission and also symptoms and severity of disease if patient was infected with COVID 19. RESULTS: Out of 263 patients 41 (22 CD, 19 UC) was COVID 19 positive. Mean age of COVID 19 positive patients was 43±14, 19 were males and 22 females. In COVID 19 positive group 26 patients were on anti-TNF therapy (15 on infliximab and 6 on adalimumab), while 15 were treated with vedolizumab. Risk factors for COVID 19 infection were use of public transportation (p<0.05), active disease (p<0.05), residency in capital city (p<0.05) and presence of COVID 19 infection in a household member (p<0.05). Other factors such as age, sex, blood type, use of conventional immunosuppressive therapy and class of biologic drug did not differ between infected and uninfected group. Pneumonia was diagnosed in 7 patients (17%) and hospital admission was necessary in 4 cases (9.75%). All hospitalized patients were using corticosteroids due to relapse of IBD. Most common symptoms of infection were fever in 26 (63.4%), tiredness in 19 (46.3%) and loss of taste and smell in 17 (41.4%) patients. All patients recovered successfully and none needed mechanical ventilation. CONCLUSION: Use of biologic therapy during COVID 19 pandemic is safe in IBD patients. Since we did not observe any fatal outcomes and all patients had mild to moderate COVID 19 presentation it is possible that biologic therapy, especially anti-TNF, has a protective role in preventing cytokine storm during COVID 19 infection.","Sokic Milutinovic, A; Jevtovic, M; Jovicic, I",J Crohns Colitis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8194726/,141

Based on relevant literatures that operating of these two systems in tandem was more efficient for urban management, a methodological framework was proposed with the combination of determining dockless personal mobility sharing service areas based on user preference and determining the station locations based on potential demand. This framework was applied to Geumjeong-gu, Busan, Korea. The results showed that approximately 33% of the case areas need to be designated as dockless service areas based on survey data. The required minimum number of stations was calculated by considering the travel distance between users and facilities, and the location of the stations (according to the number of random stations) were determined as a locations condition to minimize the sum of the travel distances. This framework is possible to suggest useful policies for attracting facilities, that is, planning for the number of facilities according to possible inputs from local governments and determining the capacity of stations based on the demand allocated to them.","Choi, Minhye; Jung, Hunyoung; Lee, Hyeryeong",KSCE J Civ Eng,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8221899/,141

DESIGN: The new instrument was developed through the review of relevant literature. We adapted multiple items from the following tools: The Fear of COVID-19 Scale, Social Phobia Inventory, Health Anxiety Inventory, Swine Influenza Anxiety Scale and the Arabic Scale of Death Anxiety to design our new assessment tool which is called COVID-19 Psychological Distress Scale (CPDS). For psychometric analyses and validation, we conducted a cross-sectional study that solicited data through a web-based survey using the newly developed CPDS. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: This validation study was conducted in four Arab countries, including Algeria, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Yemen. A total of 1337 participants from these countries have voluntarily responded to our survey questionnaire that included the newly developed scale. RESULTS: The final version of the CPDS comprised 12 items. Participants from Algeria (n=447), Kuwait (n=437), Saudi Arabia (n=160) and Yemen (n=293) have completed the 12-item CPDS. Exploratory factor analysis (used on the Algerian sample) suggested a two-factor structure of the CPDS. The two-factor structure was then supported by the confirmatory factor analysis with an independent sample. Additionally, Rasch analyses showed that all the items fit well in their embedded construct; only one item showed somewhat substantial differential item functioning across gender and country. CONCLUSION: The 12-item CPDS was found to be measurement invariant across country and gender. The CPDS, with its promising psychometric properties, might help healthcare professionals to identify people with COVID-19-induced psychological distress.","Fares, Zine.El.Abiddine; Al-Tammemi, Ala'a B.; F.

From years of providing picture book story time to young children living in homeless shelters, it became obvious that picture books being published in the U.S. privilege the experiences of middle- and upper-class people, especially in their depictions of home and housing. Based on analysis of 185 picture books published in the U.S. between 1999 and 2019, I argue that home as typically represented in children’s picture books presents a limited and privileged view that normalizes single-family homes, material possessions, and related middle-class experiences. Further, these books do not reflect the lived experience of the millions of American children in the United States experiencing homelessness and housing instability, as well as those who live in apartments, trailers and other types of homes that contemporary picture books would have us believe do not exist.","Terrile, Vikki C.",Child Lit Educ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8248758/,141

Under this family, Grevillea robusta is a fast-growing species got popularity in farm and avenue plantations. Despite the ecological and economic importance, the species has not yet been investigated for its genetic improvement and genome-based studies. Only a few molecular markers are available for the species or its close relatives, which hinders genomic and population genetics studies. Genetic markers have been intensively applied for the main strategies in breeding programs, especially for the economically important traits. Hence, it is of utmost priority to develop genomic database resources and species-specific markers for studying quantitative genetics in G. robusta. Given this, the present study aimed to develop de novo genome sequencing, robust microsatellites markers, sequence annotation and their validation in different stands of G. robusta in northern India. Library preparation and sequencing were carried out using Illumina paired-end sequencing technology. Approximately, ten gigabases (Gb) sequence data with 70.87 million raw reads assembled into 425,923 contigs (read mapped to 76.48%) comprising 455 Mb genome size (23 × coverage) generated through genome skimming approach. In total, 9421 simple sequence repeat (SSR) primer pairs were successfully designed from 13,335 microsatellite repeats. Afterward, a subset of 161 primer pairs was randomly selected, synthesized and validated. All the tested primers showed successful amplification but only 13 showed polymorphisms. The polymorphic SSRs were further used to estimate the measures of genetic diversity in 12 genotypes each from the states of Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand. Importantly, the average number of alleles (N(a)), observed heterozygosity (H(o)), expected heterozygosity (H(e)), and the polymorphism information content (PIC) were recorded as 2.69, 0.356, 0.557 and 0.388, respectively. The availability of sequence information and newly developed SSR markers could potentially be used in various genetic analyses and improvements through molecular breeding strategies for G. robusta.

56193,Examining the Cash-Only Price Discount and the Driving Forces of Cash-Only Transactions in the Housing Market,2021-07-26,"The potential therapeutic value of many proteins is ultimately limited by their rapid in vivo clearance. One strategy to limit clearance by metabolism and excretion, and improving the stability of therapeutic proteins, is their fusion to the immunoglobulin fragment crystallizable region (Fc). The Fc region plays multiple roles in (i) dimerization for the formation of “Y”-shaped structure of Ig, (ii) Fc-mediated effector functions, (iii) extension of serum half-life, and (iv) a cost-effective purification tag. Plants and in particular Nicotiana benthamiana have proven to be suitable expression platforms for several recombinant therapeutic proteins. Despite the enormous success of their use for the production of full-length monoclonal antibodies, the expression of Fc-fused therapeutic proteins in plants has shown limitations. Many Fc-fusion proteins expressed in plants show different degrees of instability resulting in high amounts of Fc-derived degradation products. To address this issue, we used erythropoietin (EPO) as a reporter protein and evaluated the efforts to enhance the expression of full-length EPO-Fc targeted to the apoplast of N. benthamiana. Our results show that the instability of the fusion protein is independent from the Fc origin or IgG subclass and from the peptide sequence used to link the two domains. We also show that a similar instability occurs upon the expression of individual heavy chains of monoclonal antibodies and ScFv-Fc that mimic the “Y”-shape of antibodies but lack the light chain. We propose that in this configuration, steric hindrance between the protein domains leads to physical instability. Indeed, mutations of critical residues located on the Fc dimerization interface allowed the expression of fully stable EPO monomeric Fc-fusion proteins. We discuss the limitations of Fc-fusion technology in N. benthamiana transient expression systems and suggest strategies to optimize the Fc-based scaffolds on their folding and aggregation resistance in order to improve the stability.","Gattinger, Pia; Izadi, Shiva; Grünwald-Gruber, Clemens; Kallolimath, Somanath; Castilho, Alexandra",Front Plant Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8299721/,141

In this study, we propose two novel evaluation metrics for time series forecasting: Area Over the Perturbation Curve for Regression and Ablation Percentage Threshold. These two metrics can measure the local fidelity of local explanation methods. We extend the theoretical foundation to collect experimental results on four popular datasets. Both metrics enable a comprehensive comparison of numerous local explanation methods, and an intuitive approach to interpret model predictions.

Fortunately, the emergence of tissue-engineered dressings has provided a potential solution for these patients. Recently, the relationship between the wound microenvironment and wound healing has been gradually clarified. Therefore, the state of wounds can be roughly ascertained by monitoring the microenvironment in real time. Here, we designed a three-layer integrated smart dressing, including a biomimetic nanofibre membrane, microenvironment sensor and β-cyclodextrin-containing gelatine methacryloyl (GelMA + β-cd) UV-crosslinked hydrogel. The hydrogel helped increase the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) through hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) to promote neovascularization and wound healing. The microenvironment sensor, combined with the biological dressings, exhibited satisfactory measurement accuracy, stability, durability and biocompatibility. A BLE4.0 antenna was used to receive, display and upload wound microenvironment data in real time. Such integrated smart dressings can not only achieve biological functions but also monitor changes in the wound microenvironment in real time. These dressings can overcome the challenge of not knowing the state of the wound during the healing process and provide support for clinical work.","Zhang, Yuheng; Li, Tian; Zhao, Congying; Li, Jinqing; Huang, Rong; Zhang, Qianru; Li, Yongqian; Li, Xueyong",Front Cell Dev Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8378138/,141

Specific examples include (i) adjusting an incidence rate for healthcare utilisation, (ii) deriving a disease prevalence from a conditional prevalence and the prevalence of the underlying condition, (iii) adjusting a seroprevalence for test sensitivity and specificity. Calculating combined parameter estimates is generally straightforward, but deriving corresponding confidence intervals often is not. bootComb is an R package using parametric bootstrap sampling to derive such intervals. IMPLEMENTATION: bootComb is a package for the statistical computation environment R. GENERAL FEATURES: Apart from a function returning confidence intervals for parameters combined from several independent estimates, bootComb provides auxiliary functions for 6 common distributions (beta, normal, exponential, gamma, Poisson and negative binomial) to derive best-fit distributions for parameters given their reported confidence intervals.

57519,Cost Dynamics of Clean Energy Technologies,2021-09-07,"Emotion is a unique ability possessed by human beings as advanced creatures. Emotions give people a unique physical and mental experience. Assigning emotions to computer systems is one of the latest topics in artificial intelligence research. The purpose is to allow machines to achieve natural coordination between humans and computers. This article focuses on the visual expression of emotion in the dynamic three-dimensional painting system, creating an intelligent painting system and realizing a good user experience. In this paper, the discrete method is used to qualitatively analyze emotions, and the continuous method is used to quantify basic emotions, and emotional modeling and emotional quantitative analysis are proposed to realize quantitative analysis of emotions. Combining these two methods, a comprehensive method is proposed, which uses a continuous method to quantify the basic emotions of each discrete dimension, and finally superimposes them into a comprehensive emotional synthesis model. Emotion modeling is the basis of emotion visualization. Borrowing the relationship between emotion synthesis model and visual emotion elements, this article puts forward the concept of qualitative and quantitative visual emotion elements, and expounds that the multidimensional superposition of visual emotion elements makes dynamic three-dimensional painting system emotions. The experimental results in this article show that the emotional visualization scheme of 100 samples is tested by quantitative statistical methods to demonstrate its effectiveness. Starting from 5 points of concern, the emotion visualization method discussed in this article can indeed convey or suggest a certain positive emotion (the average value of experience, transitivity, and infectiousness > 2.5, and the variance is close to 0), but we also found this recognition at the same time The degree is not high enough, and individual differences are large (mean value < 2.5, variance close to 1). This can indicate that different subjects have different feelings and evaluations of this emotional visualization. As long as the difference is within a reasonable range, this emotional visualization also has practical value, and has the ability to convey or suggest emotions.","Cheng, Shenghe",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8417380/,141
57528,A code of ethics proposal for Palestinians’ educators: attitudes and themes,2021-09-07,"BACKGROUND: Statins reportedly have anti-inflammatory effects aside from their lipid-lowering impact. We investigated the effects of statin therapy on the level of C-reactive protein (CRP) or highly sensitive CRP (hs-CRP), a liver-derived marker of systemic inflammation, among stroke patients. METHODS: An online search was performed in Scopus, PubMed/MEDLINE, ISI Web of Science, and Google Scholar up to November 2020 to recognize clinical trials investigating the effects of statins on the CRP level in stroke patients. RESULTS: Overall, nine studies (11 treatment arms) with 1659 participants met the inclusion criteria. Six out of 9 studies (8 out of 11 arms) were categorized as studies with a high-quality methodological approach using the Cochrane Collaboration's tool. Data from 5 treatment arms indicated a significant decrease in CRP concentration, and in one treatment arm, CRP concentration did not suggest any considerable alteration following statin therapy. Moreover, two treatment arms showed a significant reduction in hs-CRP concentration and three treatment arms revealed no significant alteration in hs-CRP concentration following statin therapy. Generally, results were heterogeneous and independent of the type of statin, statin dose, treatment duration, and changes in plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that statin therapy could reduce and, therefore, could be considered in these patients as potential anti-inflammatory agents.","Alikiaii, Babak; Heidari, Zahra; Bagherniya, Mohammad; Askari, Gholamreza; Sathyapalan, Thozhukat; Sahebkar, Amirhossein",Mediators Inflamm,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8418548/,141

In this work, the direct photodegradation behavior of 11 SAs under simulated sunlight was first investigated, and the results indicated that the direct photolysis of SMP is the slowest among these SAs. Then the oxidation degradation of SMP in UV/Co(II)/peroxymonosulfate (PMS) system was systematically explored. Up to 95.2% removal of 0.071 mM SMP was observed after 20 min of reaction under the optimal condition with a molar ratio of 1:150:5 between SMP, PMS, and Co(II). The effects of some coexisting anions on degradation of SMP were investigated. It was found that Cl(−) and high concentrations of CO(3)(2−) and HCO(3)(−) have a significant inhibitory effect, while HPO(4)(2−) has only a slight positive effect. Radical scavenger experiments indicated that hydroxyl radicals (HO(•)) are prevailing active species responsible for SMP removal in UV/Co(II)/PMS system. The degradation of SMP in UV/Co(II)/PMS system was accomplished mainly by hydroxylation of the aromatic ring, extrusion of SO(2), oxidation of NH(2) group, and N − S bond cleavage. Eight intermediates for SMP degradation were identified, and their toxicities to aquatic organisms were predicted by using the ECOSAR program based on the structure − activity relationships (SARs), which suggested that the chronic toxicities of SMP and its degradation intermediates are more significant than their acute toxicities. The present research indicates that UV/Co(II)/PMS system is applicable for SMP degradation in aqueous solutions and may be helpful to understand the transformation behavior of SAs.

BACKGROUND Mounting evidence suggests that the mechanisms of weight loss and the improvement in glucose metabolism seen after LSG are related not only to gastric restriction but also to neurohormonal changes. METHODS : Fasting and postprandial levels at 60 and 120 minutes after a standard test meal of the above peptides and glucose metabolism indices were evaluated in 15 consecutive morbidly obese (MO) subjects before and 6 and 12 months after LSG. As study controls, 15 lean subjects matched for age and sex were also assessed. RESULTS Body mass index values notably decreased at 6 and 12 months (P < 0.01), postoperatively. In addition, an overall improvement of the glycemic profile of MO patients was noted. After LSG, markedly decreased fasting and postprandial levels of ghrelin, amylin, and leptin were observed. A significant postprandial increase of PYY and GLP-1 levels was also noted postoperatively. Interestingly, significantly increased levels of PP were noted only at 60 minutes postprandially after LSG. CONCLUSIONS LSG markedly improved glucose homeostasis and generated significant changes in ghrelin, PP, PYY, GLP-1, amylin, and leptin levels. These multiple hormonal actions may have several beneficial effects on the underlying mechanism of weight loss, demonstrating that LSG could be more than just a restrictive bariatric operation.","Dimitriadis, Efstathios; Daskalakis, Markos; Kampa, Marilena; Peppe, Anastasia; Papadakis, John A; Melissas, John",Annals of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/sla.0b013e31826e1846; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23108120/,141

64050,What's on the agenda for post-pandemic meetings?,2020-08-03,"BACKGROUND Preoperative neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy (NACRT) is applied for resectable pancreatic cancer (RPC). To maximize the efficacy of NACRT, it is essential to ensure the accurate placement of fiducial markers for image-guided radiation. However, no standard method for delivering fiducial markers has been established to date, and the nature of RPC during NACRT remains unclear. AIM To determine the feasibility, safety and benefits of endoscopic ultrasound-guided (EUS) fiducial marker placement in patients with RPC. METHODS This was a prospective case series of 29 patients (mean age, 67.5 years; 62.1% male) with RPC referred to our facility for NACRT. Under EUS guidance, a single gold marker was placed into the tumor using either a 19- or 22-gauge fine-needle aspiration needle. The differences in daily marker positioning were measured by comparing simulation computed tomography and treatment computed tomography. RESULTS In all 29 patients (100%) who underwent EUS fiducial marker placement, fiducials were placed successfully with only minor, self-limiting bleeding during puncture observed in 2 patients (6.9%). NACRT was subsequently administered to all patients and completed in 28/29 (96.6%) cases, with one patient experiencing repeat cholangitis. Spontaneous migration of gold markers was observed in 1 patient. Twenty-four patients (82.8%) had surgery with 91.7% (22/24) R0 resection, and two patients experienced complete remission. No inflammatory changes around the marker were observed in the surgical specimen. The daily position of gold markers showed large positional changes, particularly in the superior-inferior direction. Moreover, tumor location was affected by food and fluid intake as well as bowel gas, which changes daily. CONCLUSION EUS fiducial marker placement following NACRT for RPC is feasible and safe. The RPC is mobile and is affected by not only aspiration, but also food and fluid intake and bowel condition.","Ashida, Reiko; Fukutake, Nobuyasu; Takada, Ryoji; Ioka, Tatsuya; Ohkawa, Kazuyoshi; Katayama, Kazuhiro; Akita, Hirofumi; Takahashi, Hidenori; Ohira, Shingo; Teshima, Teruki",World journal of gastrointestinal oncology,https://doi.org/10.4251/wjgo.v12.i7.768; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32864044/,141

Further research is required to halt progression of multi-organ injury induced by hyper-inflammation. AREAS COVERED PubMed/MEDLINETM databases were accessed between May 9th-June 9th, 2020, to review the latest perspectives on the treatment and pathogenesis of CRS. EXPERT OPINION Over-activity of chemotaxis triggers a macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) resulting in the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. IL-6 and TNF- α are at the forefront of hyper-inflammation. The inflammatory cascade induces endothelial activation and capillary leak, leading to circulatory collapse and shock. As endothelial dysfunction persists, there is activation of the clotting cascade and microvascular obstruction. Continued endothelial activation results in multi-organ failure, regardless of pulmonary tissue damage. We propose that targeting the endothelium may interrupt this cycle. Immuno-modulating therapies have been suggested, however, further data is necessary to confirm that they do not jeopardize adaptive immunity. Inhibition of IL-6 and the Janus Kinase, signal transducer and activator of transcription proteins pathway (JAK/STAT), are favorable targets. Remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) reduces the inflammation of sepsis in animal models and should be considered as a low risk intervention, in combination with cardiovascular protection.","Pearce, Lucie; Davidson, Sean M; Yellon, Derek M",Expert opinion on therapeutic targets,https://doi.org/10.1080/14728222.2020.1783243; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32594778/,141

MATERIALS AND METHODS This retrospective study included 28 patients (18 with CPPD, 10 controls) who underwent DECT of the wrist. Collagen density maps were reconstructed from the DECT datasets and used to measure densities in regions of interest (ROIs) placed in the scapholunate (SL) ligament (dorsal, palmar, proximal), lunotriquetral (LT) ligament, and extensor carpi radialis (ECR) tendon, (n = 260 measurements). The presence of calcifications on standard CT images in these regions was assessed by a blinded reader. Densities were compared with nonparametric tests, and linear regression analysis was performed to investigate the impact of age, sex, and CT- detected calcium deposition on collagen density. RESULTS Collagen density in the SL ligament was significantly higher in CPPD patients than in controls (overall mean: 265.4 ± 32.1 HU vs. 196.3 ± 33.8 HU; p < 0.001). In the ECR tendon, collagen densities did not differ significantly (p = 0.672): 161.3 ± 20.1 HU in CPPD vs. 163.6 ± 12.0 HU in controls. Regression analysis showed that diagnosis, but not age or calcification, had a significant impact on collagen density. CONCLUSION Collagen density of the SL ligament is significantly higher in CPPD patients than in control patients. Further research is needed to understand these changes in the extracellular matrix of ligaments in CPPD.","Ziegeler, Katharina; Richter, Sophia-Theresa; Hermann, Sandra; Hermann, Kay Geert A; Hamm, Bernd; Diekhoff, Torsten",Skeletal radiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00256-020-03580-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32803375/,141

The objective of this study was to evaluate the early safety and efficacy of the second-generation DED. METHODS We retrospectively analyzed all patients with unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIAs) treated with the DED between November 2015 and December 2017 in three German tertiary care centers. Procedural details, complications, and morbidity within 30 days after treatment, as well as the aneurysm occlusion rates after 6 months (O'Kelly-Marotta scale, OKM), were evaluated. RESULTS Implantation of the DED was attempted in 42 patients with 42 aneurysms. All procedures were technically successful. Multiple DEDs were used in three aneurysms (7.2%) and adjunctive coiling in 11 (26.2%). Procedure-related complications occurred in four cases (9.5%) including three thromboembolic events and one aneurysm perforation. The morbidity rate was 2.4% and there was no mortality. One patient suffered an ischemic stroke with persistent aphasia at 30-day follow-up due to a thromboembolic infarct (modified Rankin Scale score 1). Among 33 patients (78.6%) available for angiographic follow-up, complete (OKM D) and favorable (OKM C+D) aneurysm occlusion was obtained in 72.7% (24/33) and 87.9% (29/33), respectively. CONCLUSIONS Endovascular treatment of UIAs with the DED is associated with high procedural safety and adequate occlusion rates.

71609,The role of public communication in decision making for waste management infrastructure.,2017,"BACKGROUND Perioperative fluid therapy remains a highly debated topic. Its purpose is to maintain or restore effective circulating blood volume during the immediate perioperative period. Maintaining effective circulating blood volume and pressure are key components of assuring adequate organ perfusion while avoiding the risks associated with either organ hypo- or hyperperfusion. Relative to perioperative fluid therapy, three inescapable conclusions exist: overhydration is bad, underhydration is bad, and what we assume about the fluid status of our patients may be incorrect. There is wide variability of practice, both between individuals and institutions. The aims of this paper are to clearly define the risks and benefits of fluid choices within the perioperative space, to describe current evidence-based methodologies for their administration, and ultimately to reduce the variability with which perioperative fluids are administered. METHODS Based on the abovementioned acknowledgements, a group of 72 researchers, well known within the field of fluid resuscitation, were invited, via email, to attend a meeting that was held in Chicago in 2011 to discuss perioperative fluid therapy. From the 72 invitees, 14 researchers representing 7 countries attended, and thus, the international Fluid Optimization Group (FOG) came into existence. These researches, working collaboratively, have reviewed the data from 162 different fluid resuscitation papers including both operative and intensive care unit populations. This manuscript is the result of 3 years of evidence-based, discussions, analysis, and synthesis of the currently known risks and benefits of individual fluids and the best methods for administering them. RESULTS The results of this review paper provide an overview of the components of an effective perioperative fluid administration plan and address both the physiologic principles and outcomes of fluid administration. CONCLUSIONS We recommend that both perioperative fluid choice and therapy be individualized. Patients should receive fluid therapy guided by predefined physiologic targets. Specifically, fluids should be administered when patients require augmentation of their perfusion and are also volume responsive. This paper provides a general approach to fluid therapy and practical recommendations.","Navarro, Lais Helena Camacho; Bloomstone, Joshua A; Auler, Jose Otavio Costa; Cannesson, Maxime; Rocca, Giorgio Della; Gan, Tong J; Kinsky, Michael; Magder, Sheldon; Miller, Timothy E; Mythen, Monty; Perel, Azriel; Reuter, Daniel A; Pinsky, Michael R; Kramer, George C",Perioperative medicine,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13741-015-0014-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25897397/,141

METHODS A systematic review of studies published in English in six databases (CINAHL, Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, HaPI, and Cochrane) prior to April 2018 was undertaken using the PROSPERO protocol and PRISMA guidelines. Included studies were those reporting the psychometric properties of brief (≤15 items) tools that measure dietary, activity, or sleep-related behaviours, alone or in combination, in children birth to 4.9 years of age. RESULTS The search identified 11 379 papers, 200 full-text articles were screened for eligibility, and 12 met the inclusion criteria. Three studies measured two behavioural domains, while most assessed a single behaviour (three diet, five physical activity, one sleep, and none sedentary behaviour). Only two (one diet, one sleep) focused on the under 2 age group. Few studies assessed reliability, and validity and findings were mixed. CONCLUSIONS There is a need to develop brief tools to measure early life obesity-related behaviours, particularly those assessing sedentary behaviour and sleep and tools that cover multiple domains.","Byrne, Rebecca; Bell, Lucy; Taylor, Rachael W; Mauch, Chelsea; Mihrshahi, Seema; Zarnowiecki, Dorota; Hesketh, Kylie D; Wen, Li Ming; Trost, Stewart G; Golley, Rebecca",Obesity reviews : an official journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity,https://doi.org/10.1111/obr.12801; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30468286/,141

The US national strategy for pandemic influenza preparedness and response assigns roles to governments, businesses, civic and community-based organizations, individuals, and families. Because influenza is highly contagious, inadequate preparedness or untimely response in vulnerable populations increases the risk of infection for the general population. Recent public health emergencies have reinforced the importance of preparedness and the challenges of effective response among vulnerable populations. We explore definitions and determinants of vulnerable, at-risk, and special populations and highlight approaches for ensuring that pandemic influenza preparedness includes these populations and enables them to respond appropriately.

82248,Caring for vulnerable patients during the pandemic: the consultant ophthalmologist.,2020-07-20,"Introduction: To present our initial clinical experience with laparoscopic partial adrenalectomy using indocyanine green dye with near-infrared fluorescence imaging.Material and methods: A total of eight patients underwent transperitoneal laparoscopic partial adrenalectomy using indocyanine green dye with near-infrared fluorescence imaging in our clinic. After 5 mg intravenous indocyanine green dye administration, we resected the mass under the guidance of near-infrared fluorescence imaging and white light visualization in an effort to completely excise the mass while sparing uninvolved adrenal tissue.Results: Seven patients underwent unilateral and one patient underwent bilateral laparoscopic partial adrenalectomy. The median tumor size was 43 mm. The surgery was successfully performed with negative margins in all patients. The tumors were hypofluorescent relative to normal adrenal tissue with indocyanine green dye with near-infrared fluorescence imaging in patients with Cushing's syndrome, aldosteronoma, and adrenal cyst. However, pheochromocytoma and angiomyolipoma were noted to be isoflourorescent and hyperfluorescent relative to normal adrenal parenchyma, respectively.Conclusions: Laparoscopic partial adrenalectomy using intraoperative indocyanine green dye with near-infrared fluorescence imaging seems to be safe and feasible. This technology may ultimately be helpful in resecting lesions with more precise surgical margins by identifying the vascular structure during laparoscopic partial adrenalectomy.

The present study was designed to compare the efficacy and safety of these two procedures. METHODS From January 2007 to July 2008, 64 eligible patients were randomly assigned to LSG or LRYGB. During the 5-year follow-up, we compared morbidity rate, body mass index (BMI), percent of excess weight loss (%EWL), Moorehead-Ardelt (M-A) II quality of life, and resolution or improvement rate of obesity-related comorbidities between the groups. RESULTS Both groups were matched with respect to age, gender, and BMI. Slightly more major complications were observed in patients undergoing LRYGB (P > 0.05). Weight loss was significantly better with LRYGB except during the first postoperative year. At 5 years, %EWL for LSG and LRYGB was 63.2 ± 24.5 % and 76.2 ± 21.7 % (P = 0.02), respectively. No statistical difference was observed in quality of life between the groups at all intervals (P > 0.05). At the last follow-up, most comorbidities in both groups were resolved or improved, with no difference between the groups (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION LRYGB and LSG are equally safe and effective in quality of life and improvement or resolution of comorbidities, and LRYGB possesses the superiority in terms of weight loss. Further studies are needed to evaluate micronutrient deficiencies of these procedures.","Zhang, Yong; Zhao, Hongzhi; Cao, Zhanguo; Sun, Xiangyu; Zhang, Chen; Cai, Wang; Liu, Rong; Hu, Sanyuan; Qin, Mingfang",Obesity surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-014-1258-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24827405/,141
85126,A Trial Emulation Approach for Policy Evaluations with Group-level Longitudinal Data.,2021-05-13,"BACKGROUND Previous bench studies suggest that dynamic hyperinflation may occur if intrapulmonary percussive ventilation (IPV) is superimposed on mechanical ventilation in volume controlled continuous mandatory ventilation (VC-CMV) mode. We tested the hypothesis that pressure controlled continuous mandatory ventilation (PC-CMV) can protect against this risk. METHODS An ICU ventilator was connected to an IPV device cone adapter that was attached to a lung model (compliance 30 mL/cm H2O, resistance 20 cm H2O/L/s). We measured inspired tidal volume (VTI) and lung pressure (Plung). Measurements were first taken with IPV off and the ICU ventilator set to VC-CMV or PC-CMV mode with a targeted VTI of 500 mL. For each mode, an inspiratory time (TI) of 0.8 or 1.5 s and PEEP 7 or 15 cm H2O were selected. The experiments were repeated with the IPV set to either 20 or 30 psi. The dependent variables were differences in VTI (ΔVTI) and Plung with IPV off or on. The effect of VC-CMV or PC-CMV mode was tested with the ICU ventilators for TI, PEEP, and IPV working pressure using repeated measures of analysis of variance. RESULTS At TI 0.8 s and 20 psi, ΔVTI was significantly higher in VC-CMV than in PC-CMV. PEEP had no effect on ΔVTI. At TI 1.5 s and 20 psi and at both TI values at each psi, mode and PEEP had a significant effect on ΔVTI. With the ICU ventilators at TI 1.5 s, PEEP 7 cm H2O, and 30 psi, ΔVTI (mean ± SD) ranged from -27 ± 25 to -176 ± 6 mL in PC-CMV and from 258 ± 369 to 369 ± 16 mL in VC-CMV. The corresponding ranges were -15 ± 17 to -62 ± 68 mL in PC-CMV and 26 ± 21 to 102 ± 95 mL in VC-CMV at TI 0.8 s, PEEP 7 cm H2O, and 20 psi. Similar findings pertained to Plung. CONCLUSIONS When IPV is added to mechanical ventilation, the risk of hyperinflation is greater with VC-CMV than with PC-CMV. We recommend using PC-CMV to deliver IPV and adjusting the trigger variable to avoid autotriggering.","Riffard, Guillaume; Buzenet, Julien; Guérin, Claude",Respiratory care,https://doi.org/10.4187/respcare.02727; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24255158/,141
88949,David Oliver: Covid-19 has made news out of old news.,2020-05-20,"OBJECTIVE SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the present coronavirus pandemic and some suggestions were made about its possible artificial origin. We, therefore, compared SARS-CoV-2 with such known viruses that were prepared in the laboratory and other relevant natural strains to estimate their genetic relatedness. MATERIALS AND METHODS BLAST and clustalW were used to identify and align viral sequences of SARS-CoV-2 to other animal coronaviruses (human, bat, mouse, pangolin) and related artificial constructs. Phylogenetics trees were then prepared using iTOL. RESULTS Our study supports the notion that known artificial coronaviruses, including the chimeric SL-SHC014-MA15 synthesized in 2015, differ too much from SARS-CoV-2 to hypothesize an artificial origin of the latter. On the contrary, our data support the natural origin of the COVID-19 virus, likely derived from bats, possibly transferred to pangolins, before spreading to man. CONCLUSIONS Speculations about the artificial origin of SARS-CoV-2 are most likely unfounded. On the contrary, when carefully handled, engineered organisms provide a unique opportunity to study biological systems in a controlled fashion. Biotechnology is a powerful tool to advance medical research and should not be abandoned because of irrational fears.","Dallavilla, T; Bertelli, M; Morresi, A; Bushati, V; Stuppia, L; Beccari, T; Chiurazzi, P; Marceddu, G",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202004_21041; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32373995/,141

90429,Editorial.,2013,"BACKGROUND Oxygen is commonly used in the acute care setting. However, used inappropriately, oxygen therapy can result in adverse consequences, including progressive respiratory failure and death. AIM To investigate the effectiveness of a targeted intervention to improve prescribing practice and therapeutic application of supplemental oxygen. METHODS Respiratory, Oncology and Surgery wards were targeted for the intervention. Nursing and junior medical staff from these wards undertook an education programme about safe use of oxygen. Cross-sectional data about oxygen prescribing, administration and monitoring were collected on inpatients in these wards at baseline, and at 3 and 6 months post-intervention, using a modified version of the British Thoracic Society Oxygen Audit Tool. RESULTS At baseline, there was a written prescription for oxygen in 56% of patients (n = 43) using oxygen and this increased to 75% (n = 44) at 3 months, and remained at 65% (n = 48) at 6 months. However, the increased prescription rates were not statistically significant when compared to baseline (χ2 = 3.54, df = 1, P = 0.06 and χ2 = 0.73, df = 1, P = 0.40, respectively). The observed increase in oxygen prescriptions was driven by the medical wards: Oncology ward at 3 months (χ2 = 8.24, df = 1, P = 0.004); and Respiratory ward at 3 months (χ2 = 3.31, df = 1, P = 0.069) and 6 months (χ2 = 4.98, df = 1, P = 0.026). CONCLUSION The education programme intervention to improve oxygen prescription showed promise in the medical wards but did not impact outcomes in the surgical ward setting, where different strategies may be needed.","Nguyen, Benjamin; Gunaratne, Yodithya; Kemp, Teresa; Chan, Wei; Cochrane, Belinda",Internal medicine journal,https://doi.org/10.1111/imj.15249; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34047037/,141

METHODS A systematic review was conducted in nine databases to identify studies that reported health state utility values by weight status. Random-effects meta-analysis was used to synthesise average utility decrements (from healthy weight) associated with overweight, all obesity and obesity classes 1, 2 and 3. Heterogeneity surrounding utility decrements was assessed via sub-group analysis, random-effects meta-regression and sensitivity analyses. RESULTS Twelve studies were found for which data were used to synthesise utility decrements, estimated as overweight = 0.020 (95% confidence interval 0.010-0.030), all obesity = 0.055 (0.034-0.076), obesity class 1 = 0.047 (0.017-0.077), class 2 = 0.072 (0.028-0.116) and class 3 = 0.084 (0.039-0.130). There was considerable heterogeneity in our results, which could be accounted for by the different ages and utility instruments used in the contributing studies. CONCLUSIONS Our results demonstrate that elevated weight status is associated with small but statistically significant reductions in utility compared with healthy weight, which will result in reduced quality-adjusted life years when extrapolated across time and used in economic evaluations.","Carrello, Joseph; Hayes, Alison; Killedar, Anagha; Von Huben, Amy; Baur, Louise A; Petrou, Stavros; Lung, Thomas",PharmacoEconomics,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40273-021-01004-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33615427/,141
93053,Using learning profiles to inform education priorities: An editors' overview of the Special Issue.,2021-10-01,"INTRODUCTION Low rectal surgery remains challenging. New surgical stapler devices have been developed to counteract problems of impaired visibility and inability to get low into the pelvis. One of them is the Radial Reload (RR) with Tri-staple(™) Technology (Covidien, New Haven, CT, USA). The aim of this study was to assess the first impressions and experiences regarding handling of this new stapler device in low anterior resection procedures in living humans. METHODS A questionnaire, consisting of 27 statements concerning accessibility, maneuverability and visibility, was sent to 35 surgeons worldwide. RESULTS A total of 85 rectal surgical procedures, both open and laparoscopic, were assessed by 31 surgeons. In 97% of the procedures the surgeons agreed that the RR stapler device facilitated access in the low pelvis. The first stapler device firing achieved complete transection in 54% of the procedures. According to the surgeons' assessments, in 91% percent of the procedures the RR stapler device enabled creation of adequate margins. Visualization of the pelvic floor was reported in 93% of the procedures. In the surgeons' opinion, the RR stapler device was considered clinically acceptable in 93% of the procedures. In 79% of the procedures the surgeon preferred the RR stapler device over the stapler device they normally used. CONCLUSION This study showed that the first experiences with the RR stapler device of 33 surgeons in 85 low rectal procedures are positive. It facilitates low stapling in both open and laparoscopic procedures. Good visibility, maneuverability and the possibility to create adequate distal margins were reported.","van Vugt, Jeroen L A; Tegels, Juul J W; Derikx, Joep P M; Visschers, Ruben G J; Stoot, Jan H M B",International journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijsu.2014.12.027; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25576759/,141

Interplay between intrinsic cognition and extrinsic environment in times of crisis.,2021-05-27,"In the setting of epidemics of communicable diseases, early initiation of epidemiological and clinical data collection and analysis and conducting relevant researches are essential to the success of epidemic containment. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), starting initially as an epidemic in China in late 2019 and now becoming a pandemic globally, poses grave challenges to the global health care systems while also provides an opportunity for studying infectious diseases in the perspective of methodology. The authors propose the evaluation methods for case reports, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), real-world evidence studies and health economics researches during an epidemic. Case reports, which are of important value for health care workers during outbreaks of infectious diseases, should be written in standard format and style and published following a strict peer review process. RCTs provides the gold standard for evaluating the effectiveness of a given treatment for the patients from the outbreaks. We review the potential challenges faced in conducting RCTs during the outbreaks. The real-world data collected from the cases in designated hospitals allow the verification of the safety and effectiveness of the intervention measures. The data from health economics research also provide important support for optimizing communicable disease prevention and control strategies. Herein we summarize the health economics research methods, study design, and technical points during the outbreaks. We recommend that clinical research and health economics research be incorporated into the prevention and control plan and measures be taken to ensure both the standards and feasibility of these studies to improve the response capacity against outbreaks of communicable diseases.","Gong, Mengchun; Liu, Li; Wu, Chen; Yang, Yue; Shen, Yang; Li, Jie; Lin, Kaicheng; Guo, Yi; Wei, Hongyun; Xu, Zeyu; Zhu, Hong",Nan fang yi ke da xue xue bao = Journal of Southern Medical University,https://doi.org/10.12122/j.issn.1673-4254.2020.03.11; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32376587/,141

Cytosponge is a novel, minimally invasive esophageal cell collection device. We aimed to assess the data on safety and acceptability of this device. METHODS We performed a patient-level review of 5 prospective trials assessing Cytosponge performance in patients with reflux disease, BE and EoE in primary and secondary care. Acceptability of Cytosponge and subsequent endoscopy were recorded with visual analogue scale (VAS), wherein 0 and 10 denoted lowest and highest acceptability. Median VAS scores were compared using a Mann-Whitney test. The number of attempts, failures in swallowing the device and occurrence of adverse events were analyzed. Risk factors for failure in swallowing were analyzed using a multivariate regression model. RESULTS In total, 2672 Cytosponge procedures were performed, in 2418 individuals from 2008 through 2017. There were 2 adverse events related to the device: a minor pharyngeal bleed and a case of detachment (<1:2000). The median acceptability score for the Cytosponge was 6.0 (interquartile range [IQR], 5.0-8.0), which was higher than the score for endoscopy without sedation (median 5.0; IQR, 3.0-7.0; P < .001) and lower than the score for endoscopy with sedation (median 8.0; IQR, 5.0-9.0; P < .001). Nearly all patients (91.1%) successfully swallowed the Cytosponge, most on the first attempt (90.1%). Failure to swallow the device was more likely to occur in secondary care (odds ratio, 5.13; 95% CI, 1.48-17.79; P < .01).

Functional genomics has identified host factors that are transcriptionally altered after virus infections. The analyses of these data by means of systems biology approaches are uncovering critical plant genes specifically targeted by viruses during host adaptation. Also, a next-generation resequencing approach of a whole virus genome is opening new avenues to study virus recombination and the relationships between intra-host virus composition and pathogenesis.

101894,Stressing less and striking a healthy work-life balance.,2014,"INTRODUCTION The most typical presentation of COVID-19 is an acute respiratory syndrome whose most common symptoms include fever, cough, and dyspnea. However, gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea and nausea/vomiting, are increasingly reported in patients affected by COVID-19. This study aimed to describe the prevalence and time of onset of gastrointestinal symptoms in patients affected by COVID-19 and to find potential associations between gastrointestinal symptoms and clinical outcomes. METHODS We performed a prospective single-center cohort study, enrolling patients who received diagnosis of COVID-19 at our institution between March 23, 2020, and April 5, 2020. We collected patient demographics and medical history, laboratory data, and clinical outcomes. Furthermore, we used a specifically designed questionnaire, administered to patients at time of diagnosis, to obtain data on the presence and time of onset of fever, typical respiratory symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms, and other symptoms (fatigue, headache, myalgia/arthralgia, anosmia, ageusia/dysgeusia, sore throat, and ocular symptoms). RESULTS In our cohort, 138 (69%) of 190 patients showed at least 1 gastrointestinal symptom at diagnosis; if excluding hyporexia/anorexia, 93 patients (48.9%) showed at least 1 gastrointestinal symptom. Gastrointestinal symptoms, in particular diarrhea, were associated with a lower mortality. At multivariate analysis, diarrhea was confirmed as independent predictive factor of lower mortality. DISCUSSION Gastrointestinal symptoms are very frequent in patients with COVID-19 and may be associated with a better prognosis. These data suggest that, in some patients, the gastrointestinal tract may be more involved than the respiratory system in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, and this could account for the less severe course of disease.","Schettino, Mario; Pellegrini, Lucienne; Picascia, Desiree; Saibeni, Simone; Bezzio, Cristina; Bini, Francesco; Omazzi, Barbara F; Devani, Massimo; Arena, Ilaria; Bongiovanni, Marco; Manes, Gianpiero; Della Corte, Cristina Maria Rita",The American journal of gastroenterology,https://doi.org/10.14309/ajg.0000000000000965; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33009054/,141

The aim of this study was to examine whether the complete ban on alcohol advertising in Norway in 1975 had any effect on total alcohol sales. METHODS Annual time series of recorded alcohol sales (1960-2006) were analysed. Autoregressive integrated moving average interrupted time series techniques were used to model the effect of the advertising ban, adjusting for alcohol prices and wages. RESULTS The autoregressive integrated moving average analyses showed a negative and statistically significant effect of the ban on total recorded alcohol sales, suggesting an immediate and lasting reduction of 7.4% (P = 0.002). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS The complete ban on alcohol advertising in 1975 in Norway reduced recorded alcohol sales. This suggests that the ban had a protective effect by reducing total alcohol consumption. The conclusion remains tentative because of possible effects of unrecorded alcohol consumption and marketing on social media and satellite TV channels.","Rossow, Ingeborg",Drug and alcohol review,https://doi.org/10.1111/dar.13289; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33763886/,141
104161,Sensors and Analytical Technologies for Air Quality: Particulate Matters and Bioaerosols.,2020-11-10,"BACKGROUND Neuropathic pain significantly reduces an individual's quality of life and places a significant economic burden on society. As such, many cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) have been published for treatments available for neuropathic pain. OBJECTIVES The primary objective of this systematic review was to provide a detailed summary of the estimates of cost-effectiveness from published CEAs comparing available treatments for neuropathic pain. The secondary objectives were to identify the key drivers of cost-effectiveness and to assess the quality of published CEAs in neuropathic pain. METHODS We searched Embase, MEDLINE, Cochrane CENTRAL and seven other databases to identify CEAs reporting the costs, health benefits (e.g., quality-adjusted life-years or disability-adjusted life-years) and summary statistics, such as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, of treatments for neuropathic pain. We excluded studies reporting diseases other than neuropathic pain, those for which the full text was not available (e.g., conference abstracts), studies not written in English or not published in peer-reviewed journals, and narrative reviews, editorials and opinion papers. Titles and abstract reviews, full-text reviews, and data extraction were all performed by two independent reviewers, with disagreement resolved by a third reviewer. Mean costs, health benefits, and summary statistics were reported and qualitatively compared across studies, stratified by time horizon. Drivers of cost-effectiveness were assessed using reported one-way sensitivity analyses. The quality of all included studies was evaluated using the Tufts CEA Registry Quality Score and study reporting using the CHEERS (Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards) checklist. RESULTS A total of 22 studies were identified and included in this systematic review. Included studies were heterogeneous in the treatments compared, methodology and design, perspectives, and time horizons considered, making cross-study comparisons difficult. No single treatment was consistently the most cost-effective across all studies, but tricyclic antidepressants were the preferred treatment at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $US50,000 per quality-adjusted life-year in several studies with a short time horizon and a US payer perspective. Among the 14 studies reporting one-way sensitivity analyses, drivers of cost-effectiveness included utility values for health states and the likelihood of pain relief with treatment. The quality of the identified CEAs was moderate to high, and overall reporting largely met CHEERS recommendations. LIMITATIONS To assess drivers of cost-effectiveness and quality, we only included studies with the full text available and thus excluded some CEAs that reported cost-effectiveness results. The heterogeneity of the included studies meant that the study results could not be synthesized and comparison across studies was limited. CONCLUSIONS Though many pulished studies have evaluated the cost-effectiveness of treatments for neuropathic pain, significant heterogeneity between CEAs prevented synthesis of the results.

Most studies suggested that humidified heated breathing circuits (HHBC) have little influence on maintenance of the core temperature during early phase of anesthesia. This study was aimed at examining heat preservation effect with HHBC in case of undergoing surgery with less exposure of surgical fields and short surgical duration. Methods: Patients aged 19 to 70 yr - old, ASA-PS I or II who were scheduled for elective thyroidectomy were assigned and divided to the group using HHBC (G1) and the group using conventional circuit (G2) by random allocation. During operation, core, skin, and room temperatures were measured every 5minutes by specific thermometer. Results: G1 was decreased by a lesser extent than G2 in core temperature, apparently higher at 30 and 60 minutes after induction. Skin and room temperatures showed no differences between the two groups (p>0.05). Consequently, we confirmed HHBC efficiently prevented a decrease in core temperature during early period in small operation which has difficulty in preparing warming devices or environments were not usually considered. Conclusions: This study showed that HHBC influences heat redistribution in early period of operation and can lessen the magnitude of the decrease in core body temperature. Therefore, it can be applied efficiently for other active warming devices in mild hypothermia.","Park, Hue Jung; Moon, Ho Sik; Moon, Se Ho; Do Jeong, Hyeon; Jeon, Young Jae; Do Han, Keung; Koh, Hyun Jung",International journal of medical sciences,https://doi.org/10.7150/ijms.19318; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28824315/,141

STUDY DESIGN Descriptive study. ANIMALS Fresh cadaveric horses (n = 14). METHODS After a preliminary anatomic study, 7 horses had unilateral endoscopic component separation involving transection of the external abdominal oblique fascia lateral to the rectus abdominis muscle. A laparoscope, placed using a balloon dissector, was used to create an intermuscular working space between the external abdominal oblique fascia and internal abdominal oblique muscle. A single instrument portal was created 10-12 cm medial to the laparoscope portal. Laparoscopic scissors were used to transect the external abdominal oblique fascia, lateral to its insertion to the external rectus sheath, from ≈ 20 cm cranial to the costochondral junction to the level of the superficial inguinal ring. Subsequently, a 30 cm ventral median celiotomy was created and the myofascial advancement was quantified at points 10 and 20 cm cranial to the umbilicus. RESULTS Endoscopic component separation was successfully completed in all horses. Component separation provided a net mean (± SD) abdominal wall advancement of 3.5 ± 1.3 cm and 3.4 ± 0.5 cm, 10 cm, and 20 cm cranial to the umbilicus, respectively. CONCLUSION Endoscopic component separation in horses is technically feasible but, as conducted, results in modest abdominal wall advancement.","Caron, John P",Veterinary surgery : VS,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-950x.2013.12079.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24304410/,141

Do the new practices related to the virtual allow the creation of a therapeutic playground and the continuity of an analytic process? In the literature, the effectiveness and the perplexities raised in teleanalysis with adults are described. Conversely, no research on the use of the virtual in child analysis is available. Given the specificity of the developmental age, the three authors present their clinical experience and theoretical and technical reflections on the remote setting with children and adolescents. Particular emphasis is given to the technical changes and to the deep meaning that these changes have had in reference to the analytic relationship. Using the Winnicottian theoretical vertex, the opposition between fetishistic and transitional use, the denial of separation and recognition of otherness in the analytic virtual space will be discussed using clinical examples. The video tool may generate in children a great excitement and unleash the infantile sexual perversions. The co-creation of an intermediate virtual playground allows sufficient psychic continuity to work on the unconscious material, and even to make emerge previous traumas that then find a chance to be worked-through.","Bomba, Monica; Alibert, Julia-Flore; Velt, Johanna",The International journal of psycho-analysis,https://doi.org/10.1080/00207578.2021.1876401; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33952012/,141

A series of chemical reactions was performed to immobilize both a monoclonal antibody and a polyclonal antibody onto the Au-plated electrode used as the sensing surface. An important step in the biofunctionalization, namely, the formation of Au-plated clusters on the sensor strips, was verified by scanning electron microscopy, as well as electrical measurements, to confirm successful binding of thiol groups on this Au surface. The functionalized sensor was externally connected to the gate electrode of the MOSFET, and synchronous pulses were applied to both the sensing strip and the drain contact of the MOSFET. The resulting changes in the dynamics of drain waveforms were converted into analog voltages and digital readouts, which correlate with the concentration of proteins and virus present in the tested solution. A broad range of protein concentrations from 1 fg/ml to 10 μg/ml and virus concentrations from 100 to 2500 PFU/ml were detectable for the sensor functionalized with both antibodies. The results show the potential of this approach for the development of a portable, low-cost, and disposable cartridge sensor system for point-of-care detection of viral diseases.","Xian, Minghan; Luo, Hao; Xia, Xinyi; Fares, Chaker; Carey, Patrick H; Chiu, Chan-Wen; Ren, Fan; Shan, Siang-Sin; Liao, Yu-Te; Hsu, Shu-Min; Esquivel-Upshaw, Josephine F; Chang, Chin-Wei; Lin, Jenshan; Ghivizzani, Steven C; Pearton, Stephen J","Journal of vacuum science and technology.

126793,Introduction to this Special Issue.,2021-01-01,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE There is need to improve image acquisition speed for MR imaging in evaluation of patients with acute ischemic stroke. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of a 3T MR stroke protocol that combines low-dose contrast-enhanced MRA and dynamic susceptibility contrast perfusion, without additional contrast. METHODS Thirty patients with acute stroke who underwent 3T MR imaging followed by DSA were retrospectively enrolled. TOF-MRA of the neck and brain and 3D contrast-enhanced MRA of the craniocervical arteries were obtained. A total of 0.1 mmol/kg of gadolinium was used for both contrast-enhanced MRA (0.05 mmol/kg) and dynamic susceptibility contrast perfusion (0.05 mmol/kg) (referred to as half-dose). An age-matched control stroke population underwent TOF-MRA and full-dose (0.1 mmol/kg) dynamic susceptibility contrast perfusion. The cervicocranial arteries were divided into 25 segments. Degree of arterial stenosis on contrast-enhanced MRA and TOF-MRA was compared with DSA. Time-to-maximum maps (>6 seconds) were evaluated for image quality and hypoperfusion. Quantitative analysis of arterial input function curves, SNR, and maximum T2* effects were compared between half- and full-dose groups. RESULTS The intermodality agreements (k) for arterial stenosis were 0.89 for DSA/contrast-enhanced MRA and 0.63 for DSA/TOF-MRA. Detection specificity of >50% arterial stenosis was lower for TOF-MRA (89%) versus contrast-enhanced MRA (97%) as the result of overestimation of 10% (39/410) of segments by TOF-MRA. The DWI-perfusion mismatch was identified in both groups with high interobserver agreement (r = 1). There was no significant difference between full width at half maximum of the arterial input function curves (P = .14) or the SNR values (0.6) between the half-dose and full-dose groups. CONCLUSIONS In patients with acute stroke, combined low-dose contrast-enhanced MRA and dynamic susceptibility contrast perfusion at 3T is feasible and results in significant scan time and contrast dose reductions.","Nael, K; Meshksar, A; Ellingson, B; Pirastehfar, M; Salamon, N; Finn, P; Liebeskind, D S; Villablanca, J P",AJNR.

127640,Response to Letter: Aerosolization During NCT Cannot be Reliably Determined Using Air Quality Monitors.,2020-12-02,"Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are a class of widely used flame-retardants. Fifty honey samples labeled as being from different countries and regions were analyzed for 27 PBDE congeners. The concentrations of the 26 PBDEs, excluding BDE-209, ranged from 300 to 10,550 pg/g while the concentrations of BDE-209 ranged from nondetected to 9,260 pg/g. The honey samples labeled as originating in developed countries generally displayed higher concentrations of the total 27 PBDEs than those labeled as being from developing countries. Concentrations of 26 PBDEs ranged from 2,720 to 10,550 pg/g in honeys originating in developed countries and ranged from 1,030 to 3,470 pg/g in those from developing countries. BDE-209 was a dominant PBDE congener in all honey samples, on average accounting for 16% and 65% of the total 27 PBDEs in honeys from developed and developing countries, respectively. Honeys originating in developing countries, however, showed much higher BDE-209 levels and higher ratios of BDE-209 relative to the other PBDE congeners. In addition, some highly brominated PBDE congeners such as BDE-196, -197, -206, and -207 showed elevated concentrations in honeys from developing countries. The findings were in agreement with the long, heavy historical uses of PBDE products in developed countries and the current, heavy uses of BDE-209 in developing countries. When BDE-209 was fortified in honey and incubated in the dark for four weeks at 25 or 60 degrees C, BDE-153, -183, -206, and -207 were detected as debromination products of BDE-209. Less brominated congeners in honeys may primarily come from the environment. Debromination of BDE-209 is also a source of less brominated congeners in honeys. The detection of PBDEs in honeys suggests that human exposure to PBDEs occurs as a result of honey consumption.","Wang, Jun; Kliks, Michael M; Jun, Soojin; Li, Qing X",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1021/jf904490g; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20184322/,141

We aimed to evaluate bladder function before and 4 months after radical prostatectomy using the urodynamic test and overactive bladder (OAB) symptom score. Among 70 prospectively enrolled patients, 61 patients completed the study. In the urodynamic test, bladder capacity and compliance did not change, the frequency of involuntary detrusor contraction decreased, the maximum flow rate and bladder outlet obstruction index improved, and the maximum urethral closure pressure (MUCP) deteriorated. Further evaluation of urodynamic parameters according to changes in symptoms was made. Although change in bladder compliance was correlated with changes in OAB symptoms, not the relative change of bladder compliance but the relative change in the MUCP was reliable factor when OAB symptoms were deteriorated. In general, prostatectomy did not deteriorate the condition of the detrusor; rather, change in the MUCP could be responsible for postprostatectomy OAB.","Lee, Dong Sup; Lee, Seung-Ju",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-83143-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33574414/,141

132035,Homecare Robotic Systems for Healthcare 4.0: Visions and Enabling Technologies.,2020-04-27,"BACKGROUND The laparoscopic approach is increasingly applied in colorectal surgery. Although laparoscopic surgery in colon cancer has been proved to be safe and feasible with equivalent long-term oncological outcome compared to open surgery, safety and long-term oncological outcome of laparoscopic surgery for rectal cancer remain controversial. Laparoscopic rectal cancer surgery might be efficacious, but indications and limitations are not clearly defined. Therefore, the European Association for Endoscopic Surgery (EAES) has developed this clinical practice guideline. METHODS An international expert panel was invited to appraise the current literature and to develop evidence-based recommendations. The expert panel constituted for a consensus development conference in May 2010. Thereafter, the recommendations were presented at the annual congress of the EAES in Geneva in June 2010 in a plenary session. A second consensus process (Delphi process) of the recommendations with the explanatory text was necessary due to the changes after the consensus conference. RESULTS Laparoscopic surgery for extraperitoneal (mid- and low-) rectal cancer is feasible and widely accepted. The laparoscopic approach must offer the same quality of surgical specimen as in open surgery. Short-term outcomes such as bowel function, surgical-site infections, pain and hospital stay are slightly improved with the laparoscopic approach. Laparoscopic resection of rectal cancer is not inferior to the open in terms of disease-free survival, overall survival or local recurrence. Laparoscopic pelvic dissection may impair genitourinary and sexual function after rectal resection, like in open surgery. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic surgery for mid- and low-rectal cancer can be recommended under optimal conditions. Still, most level 1 evidence is for colon cancer surgery rather than rectal cancer. Upcoming results from large randomised trials are awaited to strengthen the evidence for improved short-term results and equal long-term results in comparison with the open approach.","Siegel, R; Cuesta, M A; Targarona, E; Bader, F G; Morino, M; Corcelles, R; Lacy, A M; Påhlman, L; Haglind, E; Bujko, K; Bruch, H P; Heiss, M M; Eikermann, M; Neugebauer, E A M",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-011-1805-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21701921/,141

137046,Partha Kar: Covid-19-time for parity in commissioning diabetes services.,2020-06-02,"Air quality in megacities is significantly impacted by emissions from vehicles and other urban-scale human activities. Amid the outbreak of Coronavirus (COVID-19) in January 2020, strict policies were in place to restrict people's movement, bringing about steep reductions in pollution activities and notably lower ambient concentrations of primary pollutants. In this study, we report hourly measurements of fine particulate matter (i.e., PM2.5) and its comprehensive chemical speciation, including elemental and molecular source tracers, at an urban site in Shanghai spanning a period before the lockdown restriction (BR) (1 to 23 Jan. 2020) and during the restriction (DR) (24 Jan. to 9 Feb. 2020). The overall PM2.5 was reduced by 27% from 56.2 ± 40.9 (BR) to 41.1 ± 25.3 μg m-3 (DR) and the organic carbon (OC) in PM2.5 was similar, averaged at 5.45 ± 2.37 (BR) and 5.42 ± 1.75 μgC m-3 (DR). Reduction in nitrate was prominent, from 18.1 (BR) to 9.2 μg m-3 (DR), accounting for most of the PM2.5 decrease. Source analysis of PM2.5 using positive matrix factorization modeling of comprehensive chemical composition, resolved nine primary source factors and five secondary source factors. The quantitative source analysis confirms reduced contributions from primary sources affected by COVID-19, with vehicular emissions showing the largest drop, from 4.6 (BR) to 0.61 μg m-3 (DR) and the percentage change (-87%) in par with vehicle traffic volume and fuel sale statistics (-60% to -90%). In the same time period, secondary sources are revealed to vary in response to precursor reductions from the lockdown, with two sources showing consistent enhancement while the other three showing reductions, highlighting the complexity in secondary organic aerosol formation and the nonlinear response to broad primary precursor pollutants. The combined contribution from the two secondary sources to PM2.5 increased from 7.3 ± 6.6 (BR) to 14.8 ± 9.3 μg m-3 (DR), partially offsetting the reductions from primary sources and nitrate while their increased contribution to OC, from 1.6 ± 1.4 (BR) to 3.2 ± 2.0 μgC m-3 (DR), almost offset the decrease coming from the primary sources. Results from this work underscore challenges in predicting the benefits to PM2.5 improvement from emission reductions of common urban primary sources.","Zhu, Shuhui; Wang, Qiongqiong; Qiao, Liping; Zhou, Min; Wang, Shan; Lou, Shengrong; Huang, Dandan; Wang, Qian; Jing, Shengao; Wang, Hongli; Chen, Changhong; Huang, Cheng; Yu, Jian Zhen",Faraday discussions,https://doi.org/10.1039/d0fd00091d; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33241247/,141

The combination of a vulnerable population that manifests nonspecific and atypical presentations of COVID-19, staffing shortages due to viral infection, inadequate resources for and availability of rapid, accurate testing and personal protective equipment, and lack of effective treatments for COVID-19 among nursing home residents have created a ""perfect storm"" in our country's nursing homes. This perfect storm will continue as society begins to reopen, resulting in more infections among nursing home staff and clinicians who acquire the virus outside of work, remain asymptomatic, and unknowingly perpetuate the spread of the virus in their workplaces. Because of the elements of the perfect storm, nursing homes are like a tinderbox, and it only takes one person to start a fire that could cause many deaths in a single facility. Several public health interventions and health policy strategies, adequate resources, and focused clinical quality improvement initiatives can help calm the storm. The saddest part of this perfect storm is that many years of inaction on the part of policymakers contributed to its impact.

Following institution of peripheral nerve blocks, neurovascular alterations in the blocked region have been described. OBJECTIVE The primary aim of this study encompassed the assessment of the influence of a popliteal block on changes in regional oxygen saturation (SrO2), and the location of most prominent changes. METHOD We conducted a prospective randomised controlled trial. Hundred twenty patients who received a popliteal block for foot surgery were included. Popliteal block was performed under echographic guidance. The patients were randomized in 3 groups according to the location of the SrO2 electrodes on the legs. Bilateral SrO2 measurements were performed simultaneously. SrO2 in the operated leg and in the control leg was measured at baseline and 1, 5, 10, 15, and 30 minutes after the perineural injection. We quantified the evolution in SrO2 by calculating over time the differences in SrO2 values between the operated and control leg (=ΔSrO2). RESULTS At 30 minutes, ΔSrO2 increased significantly (p<0.05) at the plantar side of the foot (11.3% ± 2.9%), above the ankle (4.9% ± 1.3%) and the popliteal fossa (3.6% ± 1.2%). CONCLUSION At 30 minutes after institution of the popliteal block, ΔSrO2 was most prominent at the plantar side of the foot as compared with measurement performed above the ankle or under the knee.","Van de Velde, Stijn; Kalmar, Alain F; Raes, Matthias; Poelaert, Jan; Lootens, Tom; Vanoverschelde, Henk",The open orthopaedics journal,https://doi.org/10.2174/1874325001610010258; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27563364/,141

Methods and Results The targeted carotid files from the prospective NSQIP (National Surgical Quality Improvement Program) registry (2011-2013) comprised the derivation population. Multivariable logistic regression evaluated predictors of a 30-day adverse event (stroke, myocardial infarction, or death), the effect estimates of which were used to build a weighted predictive scale that was validated using the 2014 to 2015 NSQIP registry release. A total of 10 766 and 8002 patients were included in the derivation and the validation populations, in whom 4.0% and 3.7% developed an adverse event, respectively. The NSQIP registry CEA scale included 14 variables; the highest points were allocated for insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, high-risk cardiac physiological characteristics, admission source other than home, an emergent operation, American Society of Anesthesiologists' classification IV to V, modified Rankin Scale score ≥2, and presentation with a stroke. NSQIP registry CEA score was predictive of an adverse event (concordance=0.67), stroke or death (concordance=0.69), mortality (concordance=0.76), an extended hospitalization (concordance=0.73), and a nonroutine discharge (concordance=0.83) in the validation population, as well as among symptomatic and asymptomatic subgroups (P<0.001). In the validation population, patients with an NSQIP registry CEA scale score >8 and 17 had 30-day stroke or death rates >3% and 6%, the recommended thresholds for asymptomatic and symptomatic patients, respectively. Conclusions The NSQIP registry CEA scale predicts adverse outcomes after CEA and can risk stratify patients with both symptomatic and asymptomatic carotid stenosis using different thresholds for each population.","Dasenbrock, Hormuzdiyar H; Smith, Timothy R; Gormley, William B; Castlen, Joseph P; Patel, Nirav J; Frerichs, Kai U; Aziz-Sultan, M Ali; Du, Rose",Journal of the American Heart Association,https://doi.org/10.1161/jaha.119.013412; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662028/,141

144716,Clinical and Immunological Analyses of Ten Patients with MIRAGE Syndrome.,2021-01-09,"BACKGROUND The COVID-19 pandemic generates negative psychological effects such as distress. Social influences on subjective distress associated with COVID-19 remain understudied in the Chinese context. Wuhan with its surrounding areas in Hubei province was not only the locale where first COVID-19 cases were detected in the world but was also the hardest hit across China. Data from Hubei provide a unique opportunity to investigate COVID-19-related subjective distress and its social correlates. METHODS We use original data (N=3,465) from the General Social Survey on COVID-19 in Hubei, China, conducted in August 2020. Regression analysis is employed to examine the impact of socioeconomic status, family structure, and social policies on COVID-19-related subjective distress measured by the Impact of Event-Scale-Revised (IES-R). RESULTS First, individuals with higher socioeconomic status are not more immune to distress, and actually it is those better-educated ones who are more distressed. Second, family structure influences distress. Divorced and widowed individuals are more prone to distress than those who are married or single. Those living with COVID-19-infected family members or living with a larger family are particularly more distressed. Third, stricter lockdown measures promote real and perceived protection and also increase individuals' psychological distance from the disease, thereby reducing subjective distress. LIMITATIONS The sample is not totally random so we should use caution when generalizing the findings to the general population. CONCLUSIONS The findings contribute to our understanding of mental health disparity during the COVID-19 pandemic. Certain social groups are at a higher risk of distress than others.","Zhou, Min; Guo, Wei",Journal of affective disorders,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.04.026; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33940318/,141

For this study, we used concomitant measurements of heart rate, mean arterial blood pressure, arterial oxygen saturation, EEG, and brain oxygenation - measured using near-infrared spectroscopy. These measurements were obtained from 22 neonates undergoing an INSURE procedure (INtubation, SURfactant and Extubation) and sedation using propofol. To develop the monitoring framework using tensors, we used radial basis kernel function (RBF) to construct a similarity matrix for consecutive segments of the signals. These matrices were concatenated forming a tensor. Updating canonical polyadic decomposition was used to evaluate the impact of propofol in the coupling between the different signals. Results indicate, as previously reported, a drop in the interaction between signals due to propofol administration. This shows that tensor decompositions can be useful in order to monitor the coupling between different physiological signals.","Caicedo, A; Wel, O De; Vandecappelle, M; Thewissen, L; Smits, A; Allegaert, K; Lathauwer, L De; Naulaers, G; Huffel, S Van",Conference proceedings : ...

149631,Informing the Nursing Professional Development Scope and Standards Part 2: Exploring Current and Future Nursing Professional Development Practice Through eDelphi Methodology.,2021,"OBJECTIVE Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the respiratory illness caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, has affected hundreds of thousands of people. We aim to report the distribution of cases, prevalence, and clinical, radiological, and laboratory signs and outcomes of COVID-19 in paediatric patients. Moreover, we intend to evaluate neonatal clinical outcomes. Hence, our age range of interest is 0 to 19 years. METHODS A systematic literature review was conducted using the Medline database to identify papers published between 1 December 2019 and 9 April 2020 on COVID-19. RESULTS The search identified 27 relevant scientific papers and letters. The review showed that the prevalence of COVID-19 in the paediatric population accounts for a small percentage of patients, whose clinical signs and symptoms are often milder than those of adults. Despite better prognosis and low mortality in children, the disease can progress to severe pneumonia in some cases, especially in the presence of co-morbidities. Children are likely to become a hidden source of infection because of their atypical presentation, and they may play a role in community transmission, leading to unfavourable outcomes. There is little evidence about intrauterine vertical transmission. As no vaccine or specific antiviral is currently available, management plans include supportive treatment. CONCLUSION As compared with that in adults, the presentation of COVID-19 in children is mild and has a better prognosis. Sufficient evidence regarding the probability of intrauterine vertical transmission could not be found, and further studies need to be conducted to establish this relationship.","Jahangir, M; Nawaz, M; Nanjiani, D; Siddiqui, M S",Hong Kong medical journal = Xianggang yi xue za zhi,https://doi.org/10.12809/hkmj208646; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32994372/,141

Aim of this study was to analyze distinct recurrence patterns and their association to postoperative infarct volume and outcome. 526 consecutive glioblastoma patients were analyzed, of which 129 met our inclusion criteria: initial tumor diagnosis, surgery, postoperative diffusion-weighted imaging and tumor recurrence during follow-up. Distinct patterns of contrast-enhancement at initial diagnosis and at first tumor recurrence (multifocal growth/progression, contact to dura/ventricle, ependymal spread, local/distant recurrence) were recorded by two blinded neuroradiologists. The association of radiological patterns to survival and postoperative infarct volume was analyzed by uni-/multivariate survival analyses and binary logistic regression analysis. With increasing postoperative infarct volume, patients were significantly more likely to develop multifocal recurrence, recurrence with contact to ventricle and contact to dura. Patients with multifocal recurrence (Hazard Ratio (HR) 1.99, P = 0.010) had significantly shorter OS, patients with recurrent tumor with contact to ventricle (HR 1.85, P = 0.036), ependymal spread (HR 2.97, P = 0.004) and distant recurrence (HR 1.75, P = 0.019) significantly shorter post-progression survival in multivariate analyses including well-established prognostic factors like age, Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS), therapy, extent of resection and patterns of primary tumors. Postoperative infarct volume might initiate hypoxia-mediated aggressive tumor growth resulting in multifocal and diffuse recurrence patterns and impaired survival.","Bette, Stefanie; Barz, Melanie; Huber, Thomas; Straube, Christoph; Schmidt-Graf, Friederike; Combs, Stephanie E; Delbridge, Claire; Gerhardt, Julia; Zimmer, Claus; Meyer, Bernhard; Kirschke, Jan S; Boeckh-Behrens, Tobias; Wiestler, Benedikt; Gempt, Jens",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-22697-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29540809/,141

The limited body of research concerning food safety knowledge and practices among minority consumers has focused more on general food safety knowledge than on culturally specific food handling practices. The purpose of the research reported here was to explore food handling behaviors of minority racial-ethnic consumers through in-depth discussions in focus group settings. In this way, we hoped to identify potential unique, previously unidentified food handling practices among these consumers. Nine focus groups were held in Philadelphia, PA. Three focus groups were conducted with African American consumers, three with Hispanic consumers, and three with Asian consumers. In all, 56 consumers participated. Data were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed for unique and potentially unsafe food handling behaviors. Potentially unsafe food handling practices identified among all three groups included extended time to transport food from retail to home and washing of raw poultry. Culturally unique behaviors within groups included (i) using hot water (Asian, Hispanic) or acidic solutions (African American, Hispanic) to clean raw poultry, (ii) purchasing live poultry (Asian, Hispanic), (iii) cooking poultry overnight (African American), and (iv) preparing bite-size pieces of meat prior to cooking (Asian, Hispanic). To have focus groups include a limited number of participants and nonrandom sampling means that these themes and trends cannot be extrapolated to represent food mishandling among these populations in general.

In addition, perceivers should perceive such relationships directly, rather than by combining lower-order constituents of the affordance, such as non-affordance properties of the animal or the environment. In the present study, we investigated whether this latter claim applied to perception of superordinate affordances - affordances that emerge from relations between lower-order affordances. We asked whether perception of a superordinate affordance for reaching by different means would be reducible to a combination of lower-order constituents of that affordance. Participants reported the maximum height that they would be able to reach with their arm alone versus with a hand-held tool. In both cases, reported judgments of maximum reaching height differed from an additive model in which values were computed from a combination of perceived lower-order constituents of the affordance. The results are consistent with the ecological claim that affordances are perceived, ""as such,"" rather than being computed or inferred from constituent properties, even when those constituent properties are, themselves, affordances.","Wagman, Jeffrey B; Stoffregen, Thomas A","Attention, perception & psychophysics",https://doi.org/10.3758/s13414-020-02108-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32803548/,141

It is used in some clinical settings, though guidelines recommend against it. This systematic review aimed to determine the prevalence of uterine fundal pressure during the second stage of labour for women giving birth vaginally at health facilities. METHODS The population of interest were women who experienced labour in a health facility and in whom vaginal birth was anticipated. The primary outcome was the use of fundal pressure during second stage of labour. MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and Global Index Medicus databases were searched for eligible studies published from 1 January 2000 onwards. Meta-analysis was conducted to determine a pooled prevalence, with subgroup analyses to explore heterogeneity. RESULTS Eighty data sets from 76 studies (n = 898,544 women) were included, reporting data from 22 countries. The prevalence of fundal pressure ranged from 0.6% to 69.2% between studies, with a pooled prevalence of 23.2% (95% CI 19.4-27.0, I2 = 99.97%). There were significant differences in prevalence between country income level (p < 0.001, prevalence highest in lower-middle income countries) and method of measuring use of fundal pressure (p = 0.001, prevalence highest in studies that measured fundal pressure based on women's self-report). CONCLUSIONS The use of uterine fundal pressure on women during vaginal birth in health facilities is widespread. Efforts to prevent this potentially unnecessary and harmful practice are needed.","Farrington, Elise; Connolly, Mairead; Phung, Laura; Wilson, Alyce N; Comrie-Thomson, Liz; Bohren, Meghan A; Homer, Caroline S E; Vogel, Joshua P",Reproductive health,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12978-021-01148-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34006288/,141

While negative regulatory factors that inhibit development and are counteracted by BRs exist in the root meristem, these factors have not been characterized. The functions of UPB1 transcription factor in BR-regulated root growth have not been established, although its role in regulating root are well documented. Here, we found that BIN2 interacts with and phosphorylates the UPB1 transcription factor consequently promoting UPB1 stability and transcriptional activity. Genetic analysis revealed that UPB1 deficiency could partially recover the short-root phenotype of BR-deficient mutants. Expression of a mutated UPB1S37AS41A protein lacking a conserved BIN2 phosphorylation sites can rescue shorter root phenotype of bin2-1 mutant. In addition, UPB1 was repressed by BES1 at the transcriptional level. The paclobutrazol-resistant protein family (PRE2/3) interacts with UPB1 and inhibits its transcriptional activity to promote root meristem development, and BIN2-mediated phosphorylation of UPB1 suppresses its interaction with PRE2/3, and subsequently impairing root meristem development. Taken together, our data elucidate a molecular mechanism by which BR promotes root growth via inhibiting BIN2-UPB1 module.","Li, Taotao; Lei, Wei; He, Ruiyuan; Tang, Xiaoya; Han, Jifu; Zou, Lijuan; Yin, Yanhai; Lin, Honghui; Zhang, Dawei",PLoS genetics,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1008883; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32609718/,141

The use of HFNC as a respiratory support modality is increasing in the infant, pediatric, and adult populations as an alternative to non-invasive positive pressure ventilation. OBJECTIVES This critical review aims to: (1) appraise available evidence with regard to the utility of HFNC in neonatal, pediatric, and adult patients; (2) review the physiology of HFNC; (3) describe available HFNC systems (online supplement); and (4) review ongoing and planned trials studying the utility of HFNC in various clinical settings. RESULTS Clinical neonatal studies are limited to premature infants. Only a few pediatric studies have examined the use of HFNC, with most focusing on this modality for viral bronchiolitis. In critically ill adults, most studies have focused on acute respiratory parameters and short-term physiologic outcomes with limited investigations focusing on clinical outcomes such as duration of therapy and need for escalation of ventilatory support. Current evidence demonstrates that HFNC generates positive airway pressure in most circumstances; however, the predominant mechanism of action in relieving respiratory distress is not well established. CONCLUSION Current evidence suggests that HFNC is well tolerated and may be feasible in a subset of patients who require ventilatory support with non-invasive ventilation. However, HFNC has not been demonstrated to be equivalent or superior to non-invasive positive pressure ventilation, and further studies are needed to identify clinical indications for HFNC in patients with moderate to severe respiratory distress.","Lee, Jan Hau; Rehder, Kyle J; Williford, Lee; Cheifetz, Ira M; Turner, David A",Intensive care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00134-012-2743-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23143331/,141

BACKGROUND It is unknown whether femoral VCD reduce major bleeding after primary PCI for STEMI using bivalirudin anticoagulation. METHODS We compared VCD-treated patients with propensity-matched controls in the HORIZONS-AMI trial with respect to net adverse clinical events (NACE), defined as the composite of major bleeding unrelated to coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) and major adverse cardiac events (comprised of death, reinfarction, ischemia-driven target vessel revascularization, and stroke), at 30 days and 1 year. RESULTS Among 3,602 patients enrolled in HORIZONS-AMI, 2,948 underwent primary PCI via femoral arterial access and 896 (30%) received VCDs, of whom 642 were included in our model along with 642 propensity-matched controls. At 30 days, VCD-treated patients had significantly less NACE (6.7% vs. 10.8%, HR: 0.61, 95% CI: 0.42-0.89, P = 0.009), driven by a lower rate of non-CABG related major bleeding (5.0% vs. 8.1%, HR: 0.61, 95% CI: 0.39-0.94, P = 0.02). Bleeding reduction was maintained at one year and consistent in magnitude regardless of randomization to bivalirudin or unfractionated heparin plus a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor (P for interaction = 0.84).

This study aimed to characterize differences in gastrointestinal endoscopies in the New York metropolitan region before, during, and after the first wave of the pandemic. Methods Across three hospitals, we compared demographics, indications, and yield of endoscopies before and after March 16, 2020, the date on which elective procedures were cancelled, as well as a recovery period for five months after they were resumed. Results A total of 9,401 procedures before and 332 procedures were performed during the first wave. Females comprised 57% and 44% of patients (p <0.01), respectively. There was a decline in the proportion of Black (15% vs. 7%, p <0.02) and Hispanic patients (29% vs. 16%, p <0.02) undergoing outpatient procedures. There was a significant rise in urgent indications such as bleeding and jaundice. There was an increase in the diagnostic yield of all esophagogastroduodenoscopies for bleeding (p <0.01) and in outpatient endoscopic ultrasounds for malignancy (p = 0.01), but no increase in yield of inpatient colonoscopy for bleeding. Review of 7,475 procedures during the recovery period showed a return to many non-urgent indications, but still showed decreased proportions of Hispanic and male patients compared to the pre-pandemic period. Discussion / Conclusion Lower proportions of Black and Hispanic patients underwent outpatient endoscopies during and after the first wave. The proportion of procedures done for emergent indications, and their diagnostic yield, increased during the pandemic, suggesting a higher threshold to perform endoscopy. In resource-sparing conditions, clinicians should pay attention to thresholds to perform colonoscopy for bleeding, and to racial disparities in outpatient healthcare access.","Annadurai, Vasantham; Blackett, John William; Freedberg, Daniel; Hur, Chin; Green, Peter H R; Lebwohl, Benjamin",Digestive diseases,https://doi.org/10.1159/000515431; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33631758/,141
159381,Therapeutic Risk Management for Violence: Chain Analysis of Other-directed Violent Ideation and Behavior.,2021-05-05,"OBJECTIVES We sought to determine whether circulating soluble angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (sACE2) is increased in the plasma of patients with heart failure (HF). BACKGROUND Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an integral membrane protein that antagonizes the actions of angiotensin II and prevents the development of HF in animal models. However, because of the need for invasive cardiac tissue sampling, little is known about whether ACE2 is involved in the pathophysiology of HF in humans. METHODS We developed a sensitive and specific assay to measure sACE2 activity in human plasma and screened a heterogeneous group of patients suspected of having clinical HF. RESULTS Increasing sACE2 plasma activity strongly correlated with a clinical diagnosis of HF (p = 0.0002), worsening left ventricular ejection fraction (p < 0.0001), and increasing B-type natriuretic peptide levels (p < 0.0001). Similar to B-type natriuretic peptide, sACE2 activity reflected the severity of HF, with increasing levels associated with worsening New York Heart Association functional class (p < 0.0001). These associations were independent of other disease states and medication use. We found that sACE2 activity was increased in patients with both ischemic and nonischemic cardiomyopathies and also in patients with clinical HF but a preserved left ventricular ejection fraction. CONCLUSIONS Soluble ACE2 activity is increased in patients with HF and correlates with disease severity, suggesting that a cardioprotective arm of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is active in HF.","Epelman, Slava; Tang, W H Wilson; Chen, Stephen Y; Van Lente, Frederick; Francis, Gary S; Sen, Subha",Journal of the American College of Cardiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jacc.2008.02.088; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18718423/,141

Whether or not reliable parameter estimates are obtainable from the available data can easily be overlooked. Such issues of parameter identifiability have important ramifications for both the predictive power of a model, and the mechanistic insight that can be obtained. Identifiability analysis is well-established for deterministic, ordinary differential equation (ODE) models, but there are no commonly adopted methods for analysing identifiability in stochastic models. We provide an accessible introduction to identifiability analysis and demonstrate how existing ideas for analysis of ODE models can be applied to stochastic differential equation (SDE) models through four practical case studies. To assess structural identifiability, we study ODEs that describe the statistical moments of the stochastic process using open-source software tools. Using practically motivated synthetic data and Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, we assess parameter identifiability in the context of available data. Our analysis shows that SDE models can often extract more information about parameters than deterministic descriptions.

This procedure leads to an elongation of LVOT in the left ventricle (namely, the neoLVOT), ultimately portending hemodynamic impairment and death. This study sought to understand the biomechanical implications of LVOT obstruction in two patients who underwent TMVR as an ""off-label"" application of the Edwards SAPIEN 3 (S3) Ultra transcatheter heart valve (THV). A computational framework of TMVR was developed to assess the neoLVOT area and quantify the sub-aortic flow structure. We observed that the annuloplasty ring serves as the key anchor zone of S3 Ultra THV. A good agreement was found between the numerically-predicted and CT-imaging measurements of neoLVOT area, with differences less than 10% in both patients. The pressure drop across the neoLVOT did not determine hemodynamic impairment in both patients. Quantification of structural and hemodynamic variables by computational modeling may facilitate more accurate predictions of the LVOT obstruction in TMVR, particularly for patients which are considered to have a borderline risk of obstruction.","Pasta, Salvatore; Cannata, Stefano; Gentile, Giovanni; Agnese, Valentina; Pilato, Michele; Gandolfo, Caterina",Medical engineering & physics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.medengphy.2020.05.018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32709264/,141

METHODS This prospective, monocentric trial was conducted between October 2014 and August 2016. Patients received stroke imaging and mechanical thrombectomy under general anaesthesia (GA) or conscious sedation (CS) using our combined setup comprising a CT-scanner and a mobile C-arm X-ray device. Primary endpoint was time between stroke imaging and groin puncture. We compared periprocedural workflow and procedure times with the literature and a matched patient cohort treated with a biplane angiographic system before installation of the CT/C-arm system. RESULTS In 50 patients with acute ischaemic stroke due to large-vessel occlusion in the anterior circulation, comparable recanalization rates were achieved by using the CT/C-arm setup (TICI2b-3:CT/C-arm-GA: 85.7%; CT/C-arm-CS: 90.9%; Angiosuite: 78.6%; p = 0.269) without increasing periprocedural complications. Elimination of patient transport resulted in a significant reduction of the time between stroke imaging and groin puncture: median, min (IQR): CT/C-arm-GA: 43 (35-52); CT/C-arm-CS: 39 (28-49); Angiosuite: 64 (48-74); p < 0.0001. CONCLUSION The combined CT/C-arm system allows comparable recanalization rates as a biplane angiographic system and accelerates the start of the endovascular stroke treatment. KEY POINTS • The CT/C-arm setup reduces median time from stroke imaging to groin puncture. • Mechanical thrombectomy using a C-arm device is feasible without increasing peri-interventional complications. • The CT/C-arm setup might be a valuable fallback solution for emergency procedures. • The CT/C-arm setup allows immediate control CT images during and after treatment.","Pfaff, Johannes; Schönenberger, Silvia; Herweh, Christian; Pham, Mirko; Nagel, Simon; Ringleb, Peter Arthur; Heiland, Sabine; Bendszus, Martin; Möhlenbruch, Markus Alfred",European radiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00330-017-4762-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28213758/,141

The concentration of fine dust in Seoul in 2020 was 21 µg/m3, which is down 16% from 2019 and the lowest since 2010. In 2020, China’s emissions of pollutants such as NO2 have decreased significantly due to regional blockades, social distancing, and factory shutdowns caused by COVID-19. As a results, the concentration of precursors such as SO2 and NO2, and PM2.5 in northeastern China are also decreased, which contributed to the reduction in PM2.5 concentration in Seoul caused by westerly winds blowing. In addition, the ratio of east and south winds that usually contain low concentrations of pollutants was more than 30% of the total air currents into Seoul, which is the highest in the last three years. Moreover, the mean wind velocity and the amount of precipitation were also the highest recorded values of 2.4 m/s and 1651.0 mm, respectively. Calculations using Comprehensive Air quality Model with eXtensions (CAMx)-Particulate Source Apportionment Technology (PSAT) show that the contribution of external inflows to the PM2.5 concentration in Seoul was 65%. We believe that the reasons for the low PM2.5 concentration in 2020 are due to meteorological factors and a decrease in air pollution in northeastern China. Meanwhile, the major contribution of emissions in Seoul (resuspended road dust and non-exhaust dust) was high. When the concentration of PM2.5 was high, the contribution of resuspended road dust was reduced due to an increase of secondary generating materials. Currently, data on emission reduction due to the COVID-19 cannot be assessed, which we believe will enable more accurate contribution calculations in the future. © 2021","Uhm, J. H.; Kwon, E.

163273,"Visualising the Effect of COVID-19 on Electricity Consumption in Victoria, Australia",2021,"The world is facing economic, as well as social, crisis due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Implementing sustainable practices is one of the possible ways to address these issues. Adopting circular oriented techniques throughout the supply chain not only guarantees economic profitability, but also provides an edge to the organization in the market of fierce global competition. The concept of implementing circularity in the supply chain is novel and dynamic in nature, and it involves certain risk. In this study, a Bayesian Network methodology is adopted to analyze how the risk propagation takes place in a circular supply chain network of an automobile organization. The circular supply chain network consists of a group of manufacturers, retailers and recyclers, located in the Delhi–NCR region. Economic, environmental, social, technological, waste management, agile vulnerability, and risk of cannibalization are the major risk categories that were identified through an extensive literature review. Further, the impact of risk on the performance of the circular supply chain is analyzed by considering performance parameters such as lost sales, impact on supply chain revenue, and inventory holding cost. Risk exposure index is incorporated into the study to analyze the vulnerability of each node. The findings of the study reveal that the reverse side of the circular supply chain can be a source of risk propagation during the implementation of the circularity concept. This work is carried out under a single industry domain. In the future, risk propagation analysis can be examined in the supply chain of other sectors. The findings of the study can assist the supply chain managers and the risk experts to focus on the areas that are more vulnerable to risk.","Chhimwal, Madhukar Agrawal Saurabh Kumar Girish",Sustainability,https://doi.org/10.3390/su13158448,141

Health professionals and law and order bodies are the primary people facing challenges to control coronavirus crisis. However, there is a major responsibility on the researchers in investigating the possible Artificial Intelligence based aids that help in diagnosis of coronavirus infection at an early stage, mitigate the spread of coronavirus infection and bring peace and confidence in the people across the world. AI-driven tools show incredible potential to draw high precision interpretation from medical images and extend great support to doctors in decision making. Therefore, AI-powered support systems have been equipped as an integral part of health care center infrastructures. Chest-CT scans and X ray imaging for COVID 19 infection diagnosis aids in evaluating emergent conditions of patient is the necessary as RT-PCR test used for Coronavirus infection detection takes longer time. The examination of CT scan and X -Ray images from suspected patients with infection by an expert radiologist required careful observation and interpretation. With the outbreak in corona virus infection radiologists are subjected to extraordinary workload. Therefore, to reduce workload of radiologists it is necessary to develop an automated tool. In the present COVID 19 crisis there is emergency for development of an automatic tool which is helpful in quick analysis. The research outcomes of the state-of- the-art investigations in this direction indicate that COVID-19 detection models which are developed using the paradigm of deep convolutional neural networks have shown high hopes challenging COVID 19 crisis.

163701,COVID-19: A Crisis of Borders,2021,"Study Objectives: Our study aims to identify the prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms among emergency physicians in the United States following the COVID-19 pandemic, and explore related factors and predictors of PTSD symptoms. Methods: Study participants included board-certified & board-eligible emergency physicians’ residents, and non-emergency physicians working in an EM setting, who were practicing in the US. Convenience sampling recruitment via multiple national EM listservs was used to complete an anonymous, online self-report survey from September 2020 to April 2021. Research data was stored on Qualtrics, a secure, password-protected multi-user database with access granted to the study team only. Surveys included demographics, a binary PTSD experience question and a PSS-I-5 scale pre-piloted for ease of use and comprehension. Based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-Fifth Edition (DSM-5) criteria, we asked participants to dichotomously self-report trauma. We used the American Psychological Association-approved PTSD Symptom Scale (PSS-I-5), a validated, reliable tool, to assess the severity of the PTSD symptoms in frontline health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic categorized into minimal 0-8, mild 9-18, moderate 19-30, severe 31-45, and very severe 46-80. Descriptive analyses were reported with percentages, means, and medians using RStudio. Figures were used to visualize variations in reported PSS-I-5 scores through the course of the pandemic. Results: Our sample included 315 total complete surveys of the 362 initiated surveys. PSS-I-5 scores ranged from 0-67 (IQR 4-27, median=13, mean=17.2). The majority of participants are age 35-50 (45.7%), EM board-certified (69.5%), white (86.4%), practice at urban level 1 trauma centers (44.8%), and do not have previous PTSD (91.8%) or other mental health diagnoses (73.3%). More than half (55.9%) of the respondents self-identified as having experienced trauma based on the DSM-5 criteria. PSS-I-5 scores were higher from those completing the survey in March-April 2021 (median=13, mean=17.3) compared to those sent in September-October 2020 (median=11, mean=16.5). Most participants had PTSD symptoms (92.1%);40.7% with minimal (129), 22.1% mild (70), followed by moderate (57, 18.0%), severe (39, 12.3%), and very severe (23, 7.3%). A higher proportion of those reporting severe and very severe PTSD symptoms are female and practice at level 3/4 trauma centers. Of non-emergency physicians who participated in the study, a majority reported severe symptoms (median=31, mean=25.4). Major perceived causes of stress included shift acuity, crowding, fear of self/family/friends getting sick, lack of personal protective equipment, and dissatisfaction with hospital administration. Conclusion: The prevalence of PTSD symptoms among our sample following the COVID-19 pandemic is 92.1%, with higher PSS-I-5 scores generally reported later in the pandemic. Race, age, and practice setting all appear to be associated with more severe PTSD symptoms. More research is needed to describe and reduce the burden of PTSD among those on the COVID front lines in the ED. [Formula presented] Figure 1.

This can be tested by analyzing the concentration tendency among immigrants who arrive in Japan from overseas and relocate within the country. Using spatial models, we find that immigrants from overseas tend to move to ethnically concentrated regions in Japan, which is in line with SAT. By contrast, this trend substantially weakens with their subsequent domestic relocation, and it differs by national group. The results reveal slow assimilation among nationals from countries characterized as being low-income or culturally dissimilar from Japan. Based on these findings, we discuss potential deficiencies in a new immigration policy (2018), which has been designed to increase the number of immigrants and compensate for a labor shortage in Japan.","Murayama, Koji",Sustainability,https://doi.org/10.3390/su13073849,141

Useful information, or knowledge derived from social data, could better serve the public if it could be processed and analyzed in more efficient and reliable ways. Advances in deep neural networks have significantly improved the performance of many social media analysis tasks.

Study design: Multiple bibliographic databases including MEDLINE and Embase, clinical trial registries and further information sources were systematically searched for literature (last bibliographic search: May 7, 2021). Diagnostic cross-sectional or cohort studies that included paediatric study participants and evaluated rapid point-of care tests for diagnosing current SARS-CoV-2 infections against RT-PCR as the reference standard were eligible for inclusion. QUADAS-2 was used to assess the risk of bias and the applicability of the included studies. Bivariate meta-analyses with random effects were performed. Variability was assessed by subgroup analyses. Results: We included 17 studies with a total of 6355 paediatric study participants. All included studies compared antigen tests against RT-PCR. Only one study was at low risk of bias. The pooled overall diagnostic sensitivity and specificity in paediatric populations was 64.2% (95% CI: 57.4%-70.5%) and 99.1% (95% CI: 98.2%-99.5%), respectively. In symptomatic children, the pooled diagnostic sensitivity was 71.8% (95% CI: 63.6%-78.8%) and the pooled diagnostic specificity was 98.7% (95% CI: 96.6%-99.5%). The pooled diagnostic sensitivity in asymptomatic children was 56.2% (95% CI: 47.6%-64.4%) and the pooled diagnostic specificity was 98.6% (95% CI: 97.3%-99.3%). Conclusions: Performance of current antigen tests under real-life conditions varies broadly. Policymakers should especially be aware of the low diagnostic sensitivity of current antigen tests.

We conducted a serosurvey study to investigate SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in the urban population of Hyderabad at the end of the first wave of infections. Methods: The cross-sectional survey conducted in January 2021 included males and females aged 10 years and above, selected by multi-stage random sampling. 9363 samples were collected from 30 wards distributed over 6 zones of Hyderabad and tested for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antigen. Results: Overall seropositivity was 54.2%, ranging from 50-60% in most wards. Highest exposure appeared to be among 30-39y and 50-59y olds, with women showing greater seropositivity. Seropositivity increased with family size, with only marginal differences among people with varying levels of education. Seroprevalence was significantly lower among smokers. Only 11% of the survey subjects reported any COVID-19 symptoms, while 17% had appeared for Covid testing. Conclusion: Over half the city population was infected within a year of onset of the pandemic.

Design/methodology/approach A sample size of 65 staff of 31 LCFs that were awarded construction projects contracts in institutions in Nigeria was purposefully selected and accessed based on relevant predetermined criteria. Respondents' views on factors determining the viability of LCFs were obtained. Factors known to be influenced by C-19 are 25 of the 37 factors rated on a five-point Likert scale of importance by the respondents. Mean scores were used to rank the factors and principal component analysis was used to obtain key component factors (CFs) influenced by the C-19 pandemic. Findings Six of the first ten ""extremely important"" and ""very important"" factors are known to be influenced by C-19 pandemic. A total of 8 CFs having 20 variables with factor loadings of more than 0.5 each were known to be influenced by C-19.

In addition, the authors aim to determine the sources that influenced emergency supply purchases during the COVID-19 outbreak. Design/methodology/approach: The study used a polling or survey process implementation to collect the data on shopping patterns and to determine the drivers of stockpiling behaviors for the assessment. The polling was conducted using a snowball technique, and descriptive and regression analyses were used to define the roots of the stockpiling behaviors and the shopping frequency changes. Findings: It was determined that 88.0% of end-consumers increased their shopping volumes for emergency supplies. An almost twofold increase in the average duration of usage for stockpiled goods (from 11 to 21 days) was also determined. Also revealed was a reduction in shopping frequency from an average of seven (pre-COVID-19 period) to five (first wave of COVID-19 pandemic) days. Such disproportional increases in purchase volumes along with a slight reduction in shopping frequency indicate the strong stockpile patterns that occurred during the pandemic. Originality/value: The research is based on data from Ukraine, where the number of COVID-19 cases was low. Despite the comparatively low spread of COVID-19 in large cities in Ukraine in relation to other cities globally, people still revealed panic and stockpiling behaviors.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers continue to search for effective treatments. There have been mixed data on the safety and effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). Risk assessment is essential to identify patients who might be at high risk for complications from treatment. Objectives. The purpose of this study was to evaluate patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 treated with HCQ for risk of QT-interval prolongation and drug-induced sudden cardiac death (DI-SCD). Methods. A total of 100 patients admitted to the intensive or progressive care units at Ascension St. Vincent Hospital in Indianapolis, Indiana, between March 2020 and April 2020 with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 who were treated with HCQ were identified. Risk stratification was performed using the Ackerman algorithm. Serial electrocardiography (ECG) monitoring and 24-hour cardiac monitoring were completed. Results. According to the Ackerman algorithm, 80 (85.1%) of the 94 patients with ECG data were at low risk for corrected QT (QTc) interval prolongation (green category), 12 (12.8%) were intermediate risk (yellow category), and 2 (2.1%) were high risk (red category). Change in QTc interval greater than 60 milliseconds from initial to 48 hours was noted in 15 patients (16.0%). No events of DI-SCD were reported in patients in the green or yellow categories. DI-SCD was confirmed in 1 patient in the red category, with a QTc-interval prolongation greater than 60 milliseconds. Conclusions. Although treatment with this regimen remains controversial, the risk of DI-SCD is low in patients who have been risk-stratified to be at low or intermediate risk based on the Ackerman algorithm. © 2021 Cliggott Publishing Co..

In addition online search data are being widely used to predicting and monitor diseases occurrence and outbreaks. The most popular tool in health area for use of internet data is Google Trends, an open online tool that provides both real-time and archived information. The purpose of this study to explore the public awareness of COVID-2019 pandemic in Turkish using quantitative analysis of its digital footprints on the internet from January 1, 2020 to May 1, 2020. In addition, this study aims to investigate the relationship between online search behaviors about COVID-19 and the spreading speed of virus among different region and the effect of applied some precautionary strategies on search behavior. METHODS: The following search terms were used to investigate awareness of COVID-19;""Corona+ Korona"",""Coronavirus+Koronavirus+Koronavirus "", "" ""Covid 19""+""Covid-19"" "", ""Pandemi (pandemic)"", ""Salgin (epidemic)"". In this study, plus sign (+) which means ""OR"" was used to represent the combination of those multiple terms. Then relative search volumes (RSV) were determined for the most searching these keywords in country. Finaly, for the purpose of comparing the difference of public perception and attantion about COVID-19 across Turkey, (1) The similarity between the day when MoH announces the numbers of death and case, and nd the day when RSV reached the apex, (2) The similarity between the day when official autority announces the precoution strategy and the day when RSV reached the apex were evaluaded. RESULTS: Searches related to COVID-19 in Turkey rapidly increased following around January 30, 2020 when the epidemic was announced in China and reached a small peak. Then clear peak was seen around February 26,2020 when the number of infections rapidly increased in Italy. Finally, the apex point was seen around March 11,2020 when the announcements of the first case in the country. The search interest was continued with the massive precaution measures which were taken such as the closure of schools, and mosques, and travel restrictions. The duration of public attention in Turkey was 26 days from the March 11, 2020 to the April 5,2020. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: It is important that until disease introduction to Turkey, there were lots of COVID-19 related searches. However, after mid-April, queries for all search terms had been dramatically declining. As a conclusion this study shows that the authorities should more strengthen the publicity of COVID-19 nationally and inform public.","Avci, K.",Turk Hijyen ve Deneysel Biyoloji Dergisi,https://doi.org/10.5505/turkhijyen.2021.48991,141

The efficacy of the tonic was evaluated and expressed as cell proliferation rate and plaque reduction rate in Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells, against 3 strains of influenza A and B viruses. This boiling water (at 100°C) extract of Isatidis Radix (RIE) showed antiviral activity against influenza virus A and B. The concentration for 50% inhibition of influenza virus A replication (IC50) in MDCK cell was 12.6mg/mL with a therapeutic index >8. When cells were incubated with RIE prior to virus adsorption, the numbers of viable cell were at least doubled compared to the numbers of virus control, RIE incubation after virus adsorption and RIE incubation with virus prior to adsorption, in both influenza virus A and B. Moreover, much less virus particles were spotted by scanning electron microscope (SEM) in the RIE pre-treated cells than the cells without RIE treatment. These results indicate the antiviral activity of RIE is mainly attributed to its host cell protection effect but not actions on virus or post-virus-adsorption interruption. Cell, but not virus, is more likely to be the action target of RIE.","Ke, Lijing; Wen, Teng; Bradshaw, Jeremy P.; Zhou, Jianwu; Rao, Pingfan",Journal of Traditional and Complementary Medicine,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2225411016300700; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2225411016300700,141

The continued incidence of clinical malaria after the outbreak in Ecuador provided a unique opportunity to use varcodes to document parasite microevolution and explore signatures of local disease transmission on the time scale of months to two years post-outbreak. We identified nine genetic varcodes circulating locally with spatiotemporal parasite genetic relatedness networks revealing that diversification of the clonal outbreak parasites by sexual recombination was associated with increased incidence of clinical episodes of malaria. Whether this was due to chance, immune selection or sexual recombination per se is discussed. Comparative analyses to other South American parasite populations where P. falciparum transmission remains endemic elucidated the possible origins of Ecuadorian varcodes. This analysis demonstrated that the majority of clinical cases were due to local transmission and not importation. Nonetheless, some of the varcodes that were unrelated to the outbreak varcode were found to be genetically related to other South American parasites. Our findings demonstrate the utility of the varcode as a high-resolution surveillance tool to spatiotemporally track disease outbreaks using variant surface antigen genes and resolve signatures of recombination in an E-2020 setting nearing elimination.","Ruybal-Pesantez, S.; Saenz, F.

166432,"The Political Economy of the Eurozone in Central and Eastern Europe: Why In, Why Out?",2021,"Introduction: Parents of children with T1D experience substantial caregiving distress, and child behavior problems are common among children with T1D. Stressors associated with the COVID-19 pandemic may disrupt T1D management and/or parent psychological functioning. This study examined the associations among pediatric parenting stress, child behavior, and diabetes- and COVID-19-specific psychosocial experiences among parents of children with T1D during the initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Participants were 100 parents of young children with T1D (M age=6.7±1.6;M T1D duration=2.9±.5 years), who had completed participation in a multi-site behavioral intervention trial. In June/July 2020 (≥6 months after trial completion), parents self-reported on demographics, pediatric parenting stress (Pediatric Inventory for Parents;PIP), child behavior (Eyberg Child Behavior Inventory;ECBI), and a newly developed questionnaire measuring negative/positive impact of COVID-19 on T1D management and parent mood related to COVID-19. Results: During the COVID-19 pandemic, there were significantly lower ECBI scores for married versus non-married participants (t=2.53, p<.05). PIP was positively correlated with ECBI (r=.35, p<.01) and negative COVID-related T1D management (r=.42, p<.01), but negative COVID-related T1D management was not associated with ECBI. Worse COVID-19-specific parent mood was associated with PIP (r=.63, p<.01) and ECBI (r=.28, p<.01). Positive COVID-related T1D management was unrelated to PIP or ECBI. Conclusion: Given the increased demands of managing home, school, work and adhering to social distancing measures while managing a chronic illness, parents of children with T1D are particularly vulnerable during the COVID-19 pandemic. Clinically, findings highlight the importance of assessing parent psychosocial functioning, child behavior, and challenges to children's T1D management.","Rooney, Kellyann Wang Christine H.; Hilliard, Marisa E.; Streisand, Randi Danko Christina",Diabetes,https://doi.org/10.2337/db21-527-p,141

Far from withdrawing from one another during this period, however, engagement in sanctioned localized leisure, particularly neighborhood walking, has facilitated a welcome resurgence in neighboring, an active engagement in authentic social interactions with neighbors, albeit from a safe distance. What existed as a social contract of civil inattention in public space appears to have shifted with the pandemic to greater civil attention. With this in mind, this critical commentary aims to explore how, in this time of crisis, neighborhood walking appears to have facilitated a rediscovery of our social connectedness as neighbors. While there is no guarantee the resurgence of neighboring will survive the pandemic, it warrants recognition that, at least early on in this crisis, leisure affordances play a role in strengthening social connections among familiar strangers.","Glover, Troy D.",Leis.

While some companies have navigated successful journeys through the process of reputational recovery following self-inflicted pain, Boeing faces significant reputational and global complications which have greatly prolonged the recovery process.Design/methodology/approachThis paper is based on a case study approach examining the recovery process for Boeing, considering the safety issues of 2019 and the pandemic crisis during 2020. Although the Covid-19 spread was certainly a black swan event, Boeing had already inflicted a great deal of damage upon its business and reputation because of the 737 Max. This paper examines their recovery process thus far by using a four-step recovery model of replace, restructure, redevelop and re-brand that has been implemented in previous corporate recoveries.FindingsWhen examining the corporate recovery process, though the four-step approach is a model that can work across industries, there are some challenges depending on corporate specifics. The major challenge with Boeing is the ongoing reputational concerns regarding safety combined with the new global reality because of the Covid-19 pandemic. A full corporate recovery will require attention to each of these four prongs of the process, stretched out over several years. Any missteps along the way will only prolong the pain for one of history’s most historic and influential manufacturers.Originality/valueWhile several publicly traded companies have overcome significant obstacles over the past five years in the quest to regain trust within the marketplace, Boeing continues to face strong headwinds. Using previous examples of corporate recovery provides an interesting case analysis of what to do and what not to do during the corporate recovery process and provides a unique blueprint to what might bring Boeing back from the brink.","Welch, James",The Journal of Business Strategy,https://doi.org/10.1108/jbs-04-2020-0087,141

This novel coronavirus named the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) according to the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV). It spreads directly through close contact with an asymptomatic (carrier) or symptomatic person who is coughing, sneezing, talking, singing and kissing. It also spreads indirectly through contact with an environment contaminated by viral particles of SARS-COV-2. In the absence of effective treatment against COVID-19, awareness can play an important role in reducing cases of COVID-19. In this study, we develop a mathematical model to better describe the dynamics of COVID-19 by taking into account the above modes of transmission and the prosocial awareness. The existence, uniqueness, positivity and boundedness of solutions of the model are discussed. All possible equilibrium points are determined. The local asymptotic stability of these equilibrium points is studied. Suitable Lyapunov functionals are constructed to investigate the global dynamics of the model.","Hattaf, K.; Mohsen, A.

Pharmacogenomic drug-gene interactions (DGIs) may impact the metabolism or efficacy of antihypertensive agents. We hypothesized that providing a panel of 11 pharmacogenomic predictors of antihypertensive response would improve hypertension control. Methods: A prospective cohort with CKD and hypertension was followed to assess the effect of pharmacogenomic testing on blood pressure control. The analysis population included 382 hypertensive subjects genotyped for cross-sectional assessment of drug-gene interactions and 335 subjects followed for 1 year to assess systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP). Results: Most participants (58.2%) with uncontrolled hypertension had a DGI reducing the efficacy of one or more antihypertensive agents. Subjects with a DGI had 1.88-fold (95% CI 1.2-2.8) higher odds of uncontrolled hypertension as compared to those without a DGI, adjusted for race and CKD grade. CYP2C9 reduced metabolism genotypes were associated with losartan response and uncontrolled hypertension (Odds Ratio 5.2, CI 1.9 -14.7). CYP2D6 intermediate or poor metabolizers had less frequent uncontrolled hypertension compared to normal metabolizers taking metoprolol or carvedilol (OR 0.55, CI 0.3-0.95). In 335 subjects completing 1 year follow-up, SBP (-4.0 mmHg, CI 1.6- 6.5) and DBP (-3.3 mmHg, CI 2.0-4.6) were improved. The magnitude of reductions in SBP (-14.8 mmHg, CI 10.3-19.3) and DBP (-8.4 mmHg, CI 5.9-10.9) were greatest in the 90 individuals with uncontrolled hypertension and an actionable genotype.

Internal attentional states were detected by applying machine learning techniques to fMRI data in real-time, and externalized using a visually presented stimulus that the participant could learn to control. We trained 15 depressed and 12 healthy control participants over three fMRI sessions, preceded and followed by behavioral and clinical assessments. Initially, depressed participants were more likely than non-depressed participants to get “stuck” in negative attentional states, but this diminished with neurofeedback training relative to controls. Depression severity also decreased from pre- to post-training. These results demonstrate that our method is sensitive to the negative attentional bias in depressed individuals, and its reduction after training showcases the potential of this method as a treatment in the future.","Mennen, Anne C.; Turk-Browne, Nicholas B.; Wallace, Grant; Seok, Darsol; Jaganjac, Adna; Stock, Janet; deBettencourt, Megan T.; Cohen, Jonathan D.; Norman, Kenneth A.; Sheline, Yvette I.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.07.137943,141

169036,Leading the development of local contact tracing services across three NHS trusts,2020,"Several enveloped viruses, including herpesviruses attach to host cells by initially interacting with cell surface heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans followed by specific coreceptor engagement which culminates in virus-host membrane fusion and virus entry. Interfering with HS-herpesvirus interactions has long been known to result in significant reduction in virus infectivity indicating that HS play important roles in initiating virus entry. In this study, we provide a series of evidence to prove that specific sulfations as well as the degree of polymerization (dp) of HS govern human cytomegalovirus (CMV) binding and infection. First, purified CMV extracellular virions preferentially bind to sulfated longer chain HS on a glycoarray compared to a variety of unsulfated glycosaminoglycans including unsulfated shorter chain HS. Second, the fraction of glycosaminoglycans (GAG) displaying higher dp and sulfation has a larger impact on CMV titers compared to other fractions. Third, cell lines deficient in specific glucosaminyl sulfotransferases produce significantly reduced CMV titers compared to wild-type cells and virus entry is compromised in these mutant cells. Finally, cells pretreated with a peptide that specifically binds sulfated-HS produce significantly reduced virus titers compared to the control peptide treated cells. Taken together, these results highlight the significance of HS chain length and sulfation patterns in CMV attachment and infectivity. IMPORTANCE Heparan sulfate (HS) is a linear polysaccharide found in all animal tissues. It binds to a variety of protein ligands, including cytokines, chemokines, growth factors and morphogens and regulates a wide range of biological activities, including developmental processes, angiogenesis, blood coagulation, and tumor metastasis. The molecular diversity in HS chains generates unique binding sites for specific ligands and can offer preferential binding for a specific virus over other viruses or cellular ligands. In the current study human cytomegalovirus (CMV) was found to bind preferentially to uniquely sulfated and polymerized HS. The HS mimics designed with these properties inhibited CMV infection. The results were corroborated by parallel studies in mutant mouse cells as well as using peptide inhibition. Combined together, the data suggests that CMV preferentially attaches to uniquely modified HS and thus this virus-host interaction is amenable to targeting by specifically designed HS mimics or peptides.","Hasan, Mohammad H.; Mitra, Dipanwita; Parmar, Rinkuben C.; Fassero, Lauren A.; Liang, Quntao; Qiu, Hong; Tiwari, Vaibhav; Sharp, Joshua S.; Wang, Lianchun; Tandon, Ritesh",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/590463,141

Romania is committed to reducing CO2 emissions by over 43%, to increasing energy efficiency by over 37% and to promote renewable energy to reach approx. 28% of the portfolio (97% for the rail transport sector). The impact of COVID-19 must be immediately included in the NECP and seen as an opportunity and the NECP, adapted accordingly.

The vast Romanian experience in the use of dimethyl-ether (DME) as an ecological substitute for diesel is presented, which would dramatically reduce the need for investments in the conversion of the current fleet of diesel vehicles. DME is also as a C3-C4 fraction substitute (CFC), in sprays, refrigerant agent in refrigerators, etc. Examples of applications of the proposed solution are given (USA, Scandinavia). The advantages of DME would be that it can be synthesized from renewable sources (municipal, agricultural waste), thus adding value to waste and improving the energy resources balance of Romania and the EU.

Nascent BC differ from pre-existing BC by high expression of IL-22ra1 and undergo IL-22-dependent expansion for colonization of injured alveoli. Resolution of virus-elicited inflammation resulted in BC>IS re-differentiation in repopulated alveoli, and increased local expression of antimicrobial factors, but failed to replace normal alveolar epithelium. Epithelial plasticity therefore protects against mortality from acute respiratory viral infection but results in distal lung remodeling and loss of lung function.","Beppu, Andrew K.; Zhao, Juanjuan; Yao, Changfu; Carraro, Gianni; Israely, Edo; Coelho, Anna Lucia; Hogaboam, Cory M; Parks, William C.; Kolls, Jay K.; Stripp, Barry R.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.22.461381,141
171672,Liquidity Stress Testing in Asset Management -- Part 1. Modeling the Liability Liquidity Risk,2021-01-06,"We review and introduce a generalized reaction-diffusion approach to epidemic spreading in a metapopulation modeled as a complex network. The metapopulation consists of susceptible and infected individuals that are grouped in subpopulations symbolising cities and villages that are coupled by human travel in a transportation network. By analytic methods and numerical simulations we calculate the fraction of infected people in the metaopoluation in the long time limit, as well as the relevant parameters characterising the epidemic threshold that separates an epidemic from a non-epidemic phase. Within this model, we investigate the effect of a heterogeneous network topology and a heterogeneous subpopulation size distribution. Such a system is suited for epidemic modeling where small villages and big cities exist simultaneously in the metapopulation. We find that the heterogeneous conditions cause the epidemic threshold to be a non-trivial function of the reaction rates (local parameters), the network's topology (global parameters) and the cross-over population size that separates""village dynamics""from""city dynamics"".","Lund, Halvor; Lizana, Ludvig; Simonsen, Ingve",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1211.2163v1.pdf,141

171892,Implementation of an expanded decision-making technique to comment on Sweden readiness for digital tourism,2021,"Background Absolute pitch (AP) refers to the ability of effortlessly identifying given pitches without the reliance on any reference pitch. Correlative evidence suggests that the left posterior dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is responsible for the process underlying pitch labeling in AP. Objective Here, we aimed at investigating the causal relationship between the DLPFC and the pitch-labeling process underlying AP. Methods To address this, we measured sight-reading performance of right-handed AP possessors and matched control musicians (N =18 per sample) under cathodal and sham transcranial direct current stimulation of the left DLPFC. The participants were instructed to report visually presenting notations as accurately and fast as possible by playing with their right hand on a piano. The notations were simultaneously presented with distracting auditory stimuli that either matched or mismatched them in different semitone degrees. Results Unlike the control participants, the AP possessors revealed an interference effect in that they responded slower in mismatching conditions than in the matching one. Under cathodal stimulation, half of the time discrepancies between matching and mismatching conditions vanished; specifically, the ones with small up to moderate deviations. Conclusions These findings confirm that the pitch-labeling process underlying AP occurs automatically and is largely non-suppressible when triggered by tone exposure. The improvement of the AP possessors’ sight-reading performance in response to the suppression of the left DLPFC using cathodal stimulation confirms a causal relationship between this brain structure and pitch labeling.","Rogenmoser, Lars; Arnicane, Andra; Jäncke, Lutz; Elmer, Stefan",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.16.206284,141
172034,Disaster Management during Pandemic: A Big Data-Centric Approach,2021,"Background: Gemcitabine, vinorelbine and liposomal doxorubicin (GVD) is an effective regimen in relapsed/refractory Hodgkin's lymphoma (RRHL). Conventional second-line chemotherapy is still required as the cost of immunotherapy and antibody-drug conjugates are prohibitive to Indian patients. We report the results of a phase II, open-label, single-arm, single centre interventional study in RRHL where dexamethasone replaced liposomal doxorubicin. Methods: Adult patients (≥18 years) with RRHL at first or second relapse were included. GVDex was delivered as outpatient once in 3 weeks (Gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 IV over 30 min on D1,8;Vinblastine 25 mg/m2 IV fast infusion on D1,8;Dexamethasone 40 mg PO D1-4) for two cycles followed by interim PET CT assessment by Cheson's criteria and Deauville scoring. The primary endpoint was the objective response rate (ORR = complete response + partial response). The sample size was calculated using Fleming's 2-stage model (α error: 0.05 and power: 0.8). Twenty patients were required in the first stage. If there were ≥16 responses, the null hypothesis would be rejected and the study stopped. Results: Between May 2016, and December 2020, 26 patients with RRHL were screened, and 20 were enrolled: primary resistant HL-8 patients (40%) and relapsed HL-12 patients (60%). The median age was 35 years (range:20-52). Six patients (30%) presented with limited stage and 14 patients (70%) with advanced stage HL at relapse. GVdex was delivered as a first salvage regimen in 18 patients (90%) and second in 2 patients. After 2 cycles of GVDex, 16 (80%) had responded [partial response: 12 (60%);complete response: 4 (20%)]. Median number of cycles of GVDex: 3 (range: 1-4). Five patients (25%) required dose reductions due to chemotherapy-related toxicities. The median duration of objective response was 13.4 months. Eleven patients (55%) underwent highdose chemotherapy supported by autologous stem cell rescue. After a median follow-up of 25 months (95% CI: 5.9-44.5), the median progression-free survival (PFS) was 24.7 months, and the median overall survival (OS) has not been reached. The estimated 2-year PFS was 44%, and the 2-year OS was 79%. The most common treatment-related adverse events were anemia (100%), neutropenia (70%, 14/20) and fatigue (70%, 14/20). Grade 3 or 4 treatment-related AEs occurred in 14 patients (70%). Grade ≥3 neutropenia occurred in 9 patients (45%) and febrile neutropenia in 3 patients (15%). Serious adverse events were reported in 3 patients (15%). One patient developed Ficat and Arlet classification stage III avascular necrosis of the femoral head. One patient died due to suspected COVID-19 pneumonia (non-neutropenic fever) before cycle 2 of chemotherapy. Conclusions: GVDex it is an effective salvage regimen with acceptable toxicity in patients with RRHL.","Mehra, N.; Ganesan, P.; Jayachandran, P.

Methods: This was a prospective cohort study using questionnaires about COVID-19 administered to Japanese workers. A baseline survey conducted on December 22-25, 2020, was used to determine history of being diagnosed with COVID-19 or being identified as a close contact of an infected person. Unemployment since the baseline survey was ascertained with a follow-up survey on February 18 and 19, 2021. The odds ratios of unemployment were estimated using a multilevel logistic model with adjusted covariates nested in prefecture of residence. Results: Women (n=8,771) accounted for 44% of the total sample (n=19,941), and the mean age was 48.0 years. In terms of unemployment because of negative reasons, the multivariate analysis showed that the odds ratio of unemployment associated with being diagnosed with COVID-19 was 2.18 (95% CI: 1.05-4.55) and that the odds ratio associated with being identified as a close contact was 0.93 (95% CI: 0.29-2.95). Conclusions: There is an association between workers being diagnosed with COVID-19 and unemployment. Occupational health professionals should follow up closely with workers diagnosed with COVID-19 after they return to work to prevent them from becoming unemployed against their will.","Nagata, T.; Nagata, M.; Hino, A.; Tateishi, S.; Ogami, A.; Tsuji, M.; Matsuda, S.; Fujino, Y.; Mori, K.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.05.21260053v1?rss=1,141

172792,Temporal Progression: A case study in Porcine Survivability through Hemostatic Nanoparticles,2021-05-26,"Purpose - Procurement professionals widely use purchasing portfolio models to tailor purchasing strategies to different product groups needs. However, the application of these approaches in hospitals and the impact of a pandemic shock remain largely unknown. This paper aims to assess hospital purchasers' procurement strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic, the effects of factor-market rivalry (FMR) on strategies and the effectiveness of purchasing portfolio categorizations in this situation. Design/methodology/approach - This qualitative study of hospital purchasing in the Netherlands is supported by secondary data from official government publications. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 13 hospital purchasers at large hospitals. An interpretative approach is used to analyze the interviews and present the results. Findings - The findings reveal that product scarcity forces purchasers to treat them as (temporary) bottleneck items at the hospital level. The strategies adopted largely aligned with expected behavior based on Kraljic's commodity management model. Adding the FMR perspective to the model helped to further cluster crisis strategies into meaningful categories. Besides inventory management, increasing supply, reducing demand and increasing resource coordination were the other common strategies. An important finding is that purchasers and governments serve as gatekeepers in channeling FMR, thereby reducing potential harmful competition between and within hospitals. Social implications - The devastating experience of the COVID-19 pandemic is unveiling critics' weaknesses of public health-care provision in times of Crisis. This study assesses the strategies hospital purchasers apply to counteract shortages in the supply chain. The findings of this study emphasize the importance of gatekeepers in times of crisis and present strategies purchases can take to assure the supply of resources. Originality/value - No research has been conducted on purchasing portfolio models and FMR implications for hospitals during pandemics. Therefore, the authors offer several insights: increasing the supply risk creates temporary bottleneck strategies, letting purchasers adopt a short-terse perspetive and emphasizing the high mobility of commodities in the Kraljic commodity matrix. Additionally, despite more collaboration uncovered in other studies regarding COVID-19, strong rivalry arose at the beginning of the pandemic, leading to increased competition and less collaboration. Given such increased FMR, procurement managers and governments become important gatekeepers to balance resource allocation during pandemics both within and between hospitals.","Tip, B.; Vos, F. G.

Recently, bright light stimulation (BLS) was shown effective in non-seasonal depression but its mode of action remains elusive. We demonstrate here, using a new mouse model of depression resistant to ADs including ketamine, that chemogenetic activation of lateral habenula (LHb) astroglia prevented the potentiating effect of BLS on the AD response. Additionally, the beneficial action of BLS was associated with upregulation of a specific part of the prefrontal cortex opioid system. These results show that improved behavioral outcome produced by BLS requires habenular astroglia and endogenous opioids as crucial buffer systems.","Delcourte, Sarah; Etievant, Adeline; Rovera, Renaud; Mor, Damien; Cooper, Howard M; Le, Hiep D.; Williams, April E.; Panda, Satchidananda; Azmani, Rihab; Raineteau, Olivier; Coutanson, Christine; Dkhissi-Benyahya, Ouria; Haddjeri, Nasser",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.31.230201,141
173055,A Novel Framework of Success Using of E-Assessment During Corona Pandemic,2021,"Sensory professionals are limited in conducting sensory evaluation at indoor facilities during the current COVID-19 pandemic period. However, they are eager to find alternative methods for safely continuing sensory evaluation because it is a critical operation component both in food and non-food industries. As an alternative to indoor sensory booths, this study proposes drive-in booths where panelists evaluate test samples in their own vehicles. This study aimed at determining whether a drive-in booth (DIB) environment could be an effective alternative for a laboratory sensory booth (LSB) environment by comparing the two conditions with respect to sensory and emotional responses, participant engagement in sensory evaluation, and participant feelings of safety from the risk of COVID-19 virus during sensory evaluation. A total of 106 consumers evaluated four beverage samples in terms of sensory, hedonic, and emotional aspects both in traditional sensory booths and in their own vehicles. They rated the levels of engagement in sensory evaluation and feeling of safety during sensory evaluation in both test conditions. Overall, the two test conditions did not differ in terms of sensory, hedonic, and emotional responses to the beverage samples. Differentiation patterns based on sensory and/or emotional responses to the four beverage samples were also similar between the two conditions. While participants in the LSB condition showed more involvement and attention toward sample evaluation using their senses, they rated the DIB condition as being more consistent with real-world experience. They also felt safer during sensory evaluation in the DIB condition than in the LSB condition, leading them to be more engaged in the sensory evaluation. This study concluded that the drive-in booth condition can be a valid substitute when the laboratory sensory booth condition is unavailable because of risks from test environmental factors such as those that may be encountered during pandemic or epidemic periods.","Seo, Han-Seok Buffin Kyle Singh Asmita Beekman Thadeus L.; Jarma Arroyo, Sara E.",Food Quality and Preference,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foodqual.2021.104332,141
173094,FinTech credit firms: Prospects and uncertainties,2021,"Background: Padeliporfin (WST11) vasculartargeted photodynamic therapy (VTP) has shown significant clinical benefit as a localized partial gland ablation (PGA) therapy when compared to active surveillance for low-risk prostate cancer, by curbing progression and the need for radical treatment, leading to its regulatory approval in Europe. This phase 2b trial prospectively investigated WST11-VTP for intermediate-risk cancers. Methods: Men with unilateral Grade Group 2 (GG2) cancers (Gleason 3+4), evaluated with MRI and ultrasound-guided (TRUS) biopsy, underwent up to two WST11-VTP PGA sessions. Eligibility criteria included &lt;cT2b, PSA &lt; 10, and fusion biopsy for PIRADS 3+ lesions on pretreatment MRI. Contralateral very low-risk disease was observed. The primary endpoint was prevalence of any Gleason Grade 4 or 5 (≥GG2) cancer, determined by MRI and systematic, 14-core TRUS biopsy of the entire gland (+/- fusion) at 3 and 12 months after treatment. Treatment safety and patient-reported quality of life for sexual and urinary function were assessed with validated questionnaires (IIEF-15 and IPSS, respectively). The study was powered using β = 0.2 to reject the null hypothesis (r≤70%), using a one-sided exact binomial test with 5% alpha risk. To be valid, 44 evaluable patients were required for the 12-month primary endpoint assessment. Results: Of the 50 men treated, 46 were evaluable for the 12-month primary endpoint. Before 12 months, 1 man proceeded to prostatectomy (treatment failure), 2 men refused 12-month biopsy, and 1 man died of COVID-19. At 3 months, 12/49 (24%) men underwent per protocol second WST11-VTP PGA session for GG2 tumor: 9 for residual cancer and 4 for newly identified contralateral GG2 tumors (1 bilateral). The 12-month biopsy was performed in 45 men;38 (83%) had no Gleason grade 4 or 5 cancer, including 11/12 (92%) patients who underwent 2 PGA sessions. By 3 months, median decline in erectile function score (IIEF-5) from baseline was -1.0 (IQR -7,0). Median improvement in urinary function score (IPSS) was -1.0 (IQR -1,5), with pad-free continence observed in all patients. Median change in IIEF score by 12-months was -1.0 (IQR -5,0). Grade 3 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 6 (12%) patients. All procedurerelated prostate/pelvic pain resolved by 3 weeks. Conclusions: The positive results from this trial show that WST11-VTP is effective for PGA of intermediate-risk prostate cancer, with minimal toxicity or impact on urinary and sexual function, consistent with the phase 3 trial results in low-risk disease. Based on these data, this therapy bears consideration for approval as a conservative therapeutic option for selected cases of intermediate-risk disease.","Coleman, J.; Sjoberg, D.

Unfortunately, the global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may undermine first-time expectant mothers’ emotional health as elevated rates of depression, stress, and anxiety have been noted (Rajkumar, 2020). Thus, the current study was conducted to (a) describe the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on first-time expectant mothers’ pregnancy, prenatal care, internal/dyadic and external experiences, (b) investigate the impact of pregnancy-related, internal/dyadic, and external COVID-19 changes on first-time mothers’ mental health (i.e., depression, stress, and anxiety symptoms), and (c) explore whether COVID-related internal/dyadic stressors predicted worse mental health among expectant mothers, above and beyond their general marital satisfaction. Forty-nine first-time, expectant U.S. mothers (Mage = 29.0 years, SD = 3.1) participated via Amazon MTurk between June and July 2020;each completed an online survey about their pandemic prenatal care, delivery plans, current mental health, and relationship. Most expectant mothers (82%) reported distress due to COVID-related prenatal care changes. Additionally, pandemic-related increases in alcohol use, intimate partner violence, and external demands (i.e., caring for someone infected with COVID-19), generally predicted worse mental health for first-time expectant mothers. The effects of increased alcohol use and intimate partner violence on maternal mental health remained, even after accounting for overall marital satisfaction. Conversely, having to isolate or quarantine due to exposure predicted reduced maternal stress. Results underscore the need to provide supports that promote the emotional health of first-time pregnant women and encourage healthy coping with the diverse pandemic-related experiences faced by expectant couples.

The Beavers Systems Model for Family Functioning identified family groupings at risk of family violence. An emerging perspective on intergenerational transmission of violence from childhood neglect and abuse to elder abuse accounts for the accumulation of adverse childhood experiences and increasing risk of victimization or perpetration. An intergenerational systemic model identifies multiple contexts and levels for evaluating and treating family violence over the life span.

In diagnostic imaging, the afflicted population showed pathognomonic findings of pneumonia. What started out as an epidemic in China, rapidly spread across geographical locations with a significant daily increase in the number of affected cases. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) reports, the range of worldwide mortality is 3 to 4%. Maternal adaptations and immunological changes predispose pregnant women to a prolonged and severe form of pneumonia, which results in higher rates of maternal, fetal, and neonatal morbidity and mortality. There is limited data about the consequences of COVID-19 in pregnancy, thereby limiting the prevention, counseling, and management of these patients. The objective of this literature review is to explore pregnancy and perinatal outcomes of COVID-19, complications, morbidity, and mortality in this sub-population. We conducted a literature review pertaining to COVID-19 and pregnancy in databases such as: PubMed, Google Scholar, and Science Direct. The studies we chose to focus on were systematic reviews, meta-analysis, case series, and case reports. Twenty four articles were reviewed regarding COVID-19 and pregnancy, complications and their outcomes. Due to immunological changes during pregnancy as evidenced by the flaring of auto-immune diseases; pregnant women may be at an increased risk for infection. Women (19.7%) who had underlying comorbidities such as gestational DM, HTN, hypothyroidism, and autoimmune disease, COPD, or HBV infection were considered high risk. The most common maternal outcomes were premature rupture of membranes (PROM) and pre-eclampsia. Asthma was the most common comorbidity associated with maternal mortality. The most common neonatal complications were fetal distress leading to NICU admissions and preterm birth <37 weeks. The most common laboratory changes were elevated CRP and lymphocytopenia. Most patients underwent C-section due to their underlying comorbidities. Pregnant and lactating women did not shed viral particles through their vaginal mucus and milk, as evidenced by negative nucleic-acid tests of these secretions. Neonatal infections as demonstrated by positive RT-PCR were rare, but direct evidence supporting intrauterine transmission was not confirmed. Direct evidence indicating vertical transmission of COVID-19 is not available, but risk for transmission cannot be ruled out. Pregnant women should be closely monitored due to increased risk of adverse outcomes.","Vijayan, R.; Moon, H.; Joseph, J.; Zaidi, M.; Kamwal, C.; Senatus, A.; Nagpal, S.; Diaz, M.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.08.28.21262778v1?rss=1,141

Although it was only temporary, the fact of the improvement in air quality under the COVID-19 measures gives us great significance in the future environmental policy. Perhaps the COVID-19 has given us an example of an answer to why we should improve air quality.

Methods A random sample of adolescents, aged 14-17 years, and their families was invited to a serosurvey in November and December 2020. Adolescents' HRQoL was evaluated using the validated adolescent-reported KIDSCREEN-10 and parent-reported KINDLR scales. Psychological distress was assessed with self-reported sadness and loneliness, and using the KINDLR emotional well-being scale. Risk factors for adolescents' low HRQoL and psychological distress were identified using generalized estimating equations and both adolescents' and their parents' perceptions were compared. Results Among 240 adolescents, 11% had a low HRQoL, 35% reported sadness and 23% reported loneliness. Based on parents' perception, 12% of the adolescents had a low HRQoL and 16% a low emotional well-being. Being a girl (aOR=3.29; 95%CI: 1.64-6.57), increased time on social media (aOR=2.05; 95%CI: 1.08-3.88), parents' average to poor mood (aOR=2.81; 95%CI: 1.21-6.56) and average to poor household financial situation (aOR=2.30; 95%CI: 1.00-5.29) were associated with an increased risk of sadness.

Results: The detection rate of anxiety in the occupational group was 48.65%, and there was a significant difference in the scores of anxiety among the subjects of different ages(P<0.05);the level of burnout were higher than the average, and the subjects of different ages were in a serious state of burnout was statistically significant (P< 0.05);the general well-being of the subjects was significantly higher than that of the national norm (P<0.01). Path analysis showed that anxiety, job burnout and self-efficacy were the negative and positive factors that affect general well-being, and self-efficacy played an intermediary role between anxiety, job burnout and general well-being separately. Conclusion: Under the Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia it can improve the self-efficacy of occupation population, further overcome panic and learned helplessness to reduce anxiety, job burnout, enhance resilience, improve general well-being. © 2021 ACM.","Su, Z.; Gai, X.","6th International Conference on Information Management and Technology, CIMTECH 2021",https://doi.org/10.1145/3465631.3465725,141
174488,The Gender Gap Among EduTubers and the Factors Significantly Influencing It,2021,"ALMA (Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array) is the world's largest ground-based facility for observations in the millimeter/submillimeter regime. One of ALMA's outstanding characteristics is the large effort dedicated to the quality assurance (QA) of the calibrated and imaged data products offered to the astronomical community. The Data Management Group (DMG), in charge of the data processing, review, and delivery of the ALMA data, consists of approximately 60 experts in data reduction, from the ALMA Regional Centers (ARCs) and the Joint ALMA Observatory (JAO), distributed in fourteen countries. With a throughput of more than 3,000 datasets per year, meeting the goal of delivering the pipeline-able data products within 30 days after data acquisition is a huge challenge. This paper presents (a) the history of data processing at ALMA, (b) the challenges our team had and is still facing, (c) the methodology followed to mitigate the operational risks, (d) the ongoing optimization initiatives, (e) the current data processing status, (f) the strategy which is being followed so that, in a few Cycles from now, a team of approximately 10 data reducers (DRs) at JAO can process and review some 80% of the datasets collected during an observing cycle, and, finally, (g) the important role of the ARCs for processing the remaining datasets.","Nakos, Theodoros; Francke, Harold; Nakanishi, Kouichiro; Petry, Dirk; Stanke, Thomas; Ubach, Catarina; Cerrigone, Luciano; Keller, Erica; Trejo, Alfonso; Ueda, Junko",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.03420v1.pdf,141

JSY was developed by the NY Department of Health in response to focus groups and market research with food pantry clients showing minimal fruit/vegetable intake and interest in learning healthy, affordable dishes. Data indicate JSY increases intent to consume produce, utilize curriculum recipes, and exercise. SNAP-Ed eligible adult Philadelphia residents who participated in a virtual JSY series conducted by HPC from 10/2020-1/2021. HPC is a Pennsylvania SNAP-Ed implementing partner in Philadelphia. Due to COVID-19, HPC pivoted from in-person to virtual programming. HPC nutrition educators taught JSY's 13 weekly lessons via Zoom, supplementing the interactive 30-45 minute classes with self-recorded cooking demonstrations of recipes meeting USDA Dietary Guidelines and JSY content. A survey administered via a secure online platform collected self-reported behavioral outcomes and participant feedback on various virtual programming dimensions. Outcome assessment utilized tools associated with JSY evaluation indicators identified in the SNAP-Ed Toolkit. Within 3 weeks of completion, nutrition educators disseminated the survey to participants who completed at least 1 virtual JSY lesson. Of eligible individuals, 27% (n = 6) completed the survey. All respondents strongly agreed they enjoyed virtual participation. Eighty-three percent (n = 5) strongly agreed they learned something new, and had prepared provided recipes;67% (n = 4) strongly agreed cook-along videos were useful. Most respondents indicated trying to eat more fruits (83%) and vegetables (67%) after JSY. The frequency of several healthy behaviors increased when respondents compared actions before and after participation. Additional responses will be available as HPC continues JSY virtually throughout 2021. Virtual provision of JSY facilitated HPC's programmatic resilience, allowing for continued services empowering individuals to maximize nutritional/dietary health. Resultsant participant satisfaction, uptake, and behavior change may support virtual programming utility and viability as a complement to in-person implementation.

However, a biggest problem deep learning has, is the high dependency on hyper-parameters. The algorithm results may be different, depending on hyper-parameters. This paper presents an effective method for hyper-parameter tuning using deep learning. The deep neural network structure for video classification using Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) was used. The proposed method for hyper-parameter tuning using ConvLSTM was described. This proposed method with hyper-parameter tuning methods (Grid search, Bayesian optimization and Genetic algorithm) was compared. The experiment results show that proposed approach using ConvLSTM can be compared with the results obtained from the methods analogs to the proposed approach. However, we are looking for other hyper-parameters, for example number of filters, filter size, number of epochs, batch size and training optimization algorithm. The proposed approach can be used for correct or incorrect use of face mask during COVID-19 pandemic. © 2021 IEEE.","Vrskova, R.; Sykora, P.; Kamencay, P.; Hudec, R.; Radil, R.","44th International Conference on Telecommunications and Signal Processing, TSP 2021",https://doi.org/10.1109/tsp52935.2021.9522683,141
174650,Using Web Standards to Design Accessible Data Visualizations in Professional Communication,2021,"COVID-19 was officially confirmed during December 2019 in the city of Wuhan, China, while the first case of the disease was recorded on 17 November 2019. The World Health Organization has declared a pandemic due to the rapid spread of this disease. It is believed, due to worldwide population aging, that middle-aged and geriatric patients who suffer from chronic diseases are more prone to respiratory failure and having a poorer outcome caused by COVID-19. This paper presents the association of certain chronic diseases such as diabetes mellitus, COPD, hypertension, asthma, and others with COVID-19. Testing was done on 400 samples who were positive for the virus, 250 samples were sick of some of the listed diseases, while 150 were healthy. Machine learning algorithms use computational methods to “learn” information directly from data without relying on a predetermined equation as a model. The algorithms adaptively improve their performance as the number of samples available for learning increases. Specific parameters for different diseases were used in the paper. Based on the results presented in the paper, we concluded that chronic diseases greatly affect the number of people infected with COVID-19. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Pramenković, B.; Prasko, D.; Pulo, E.; Rončević, I.; Ramić, R.; Rakovac, A.","International Conference on Medical and Biological Engineering in Bosnia and Herzegovina, CMBEBIH 2021",https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-73909-6_98,141

Moreover, the high-density urban living engines the rapid spread of contagious diseases and thereby threatening the lives of millions of people. The high death rate and affected cases of COVID-19 in Dhaka City, Bangladesh, and its nearby areas, i.e., Gazipur and Narayanganj, gives a clear indication of the importance of activity center decentralization. Due to the growing demand for healthcare, it has become necessary to decentralize the health care facilities to the remote areas and the Government of Bangladesh has already adopted some key measures. In this context, this particular research has tried to determine the mutilated amenity facilities for diversified stakeholders aiming parallel discouragement of the out-migration of skilled professionals and attracting the non-local professionals to live in rural Bangladesh. The research critically argues that if proper facilities can be provided in rural areas, rural to urban migration can be demotivated. It also argues that the development of small urban activity centers will help emergency situation management. The methodology includes an amalgam of a two-step exploratory and descriptive survey prior to and during the global COVID-19 outbreak. The determinants and precedence of required services were determined by Focus Group Discussion (FGD), structured direct questionnaire surveys, secondary online questionnaire surveys and persona approach. The outcome of the research proposes a glimpse of management measures for Bangladesh to tackle future pandemic situation which could be a role model for developing cities also.","Das, Anutosh Roy Sumita Parvez Mohammad Shahriyar Hasan Md Musleh Uddin",Journal of Urban Management,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jum.2021.07.002,141

175067,Effective Management Tools for Solving the Problem of Poverty in Relation to Food Waste in Context of Integrated Management of Energy,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic brought many changes to social behaviours in Europe. One of its major consequences was the temporary closure of borders, which was introduced as a measure to prevent the uncontrolled pandemic spreading and involved internal Schengen borders. This has had a major impact in the way in which cross-border cooperation has been conducted in Europe, including the Czech-Polish borderland, as it dramatically restrained all flows across borders. In this paper, we evaluate the impact of the pandemic on five roles of cross-border cooperation: 1) as a multi-level governance form;2) as a regional development tool;3) as a para-diplomacy form;4) as a post-conflict reconciliation tool;and 5) as Europe-building. We argue that the impacts of the pandemic complicated regional development and the Europe-building role of cross-border cooperation in the Czech-Polish borderland. The article envisages re-bordering processes also in the Czech-Polish borderland, but with important exceptions in the regions with a high level of cross-border integration, mainly in the Euroregion Tesinske Slezsko/Slask Cieszynski. The paper also calls for the elaboration of the guidelines for possible repeated (Schengen) border closures and proposes modifications of the INTERREG microprojects schemes, to keep them attractive also in times of expected cuts in public finances.","Bohm, H.",Moravian Geographical Reports,https://doi.org/10.2478/mgr-2021-0007,141
175176,Special Issue “Levering Sustainable Food Systems to Address Climate Change (Pandemics and Other Shocks and Hazards): Possible Transformations”,2021,"Teleworking and online shopping became commonplace during the COVID-19 pandemic and can be expected to maintain a strong presence in the foreseeable future. They can lead to significant changes in mobility patterns and transport demand. It is still unclear, however, how extensive their adoption can be, since each individual has different preferences or constraints. The overall impact on transport depends on which segments of the population will modify their behaviour and on what the substitutes to the current patterns will be. The purpose of this work is to identify the user profiles and spatial aspects that affect the adoption of teleworking and online shopping, and to explore the potential impact on transport demand. To that end, data from an EU-wide survey on mobility were analysed using a Machine Learning methodology. The results suggest that while the take up of the new work and consumption patterns is high on average, there are significant differences among countries and across different socio-economic profiles. Teleworking appears to have a high potential mainly in certain services sectors, affecting commuting patterns predominantly in large urban areas. Online shopping activity is more uniform across the population, although differences among countries and age groups may still be relevant. The findings of this work can be useful for the analysis of policies to encourage the uptake of new technologies in transport and mobility. They can be also a good reference point for future studies on the ex-post analysis of the impacts of the pandemic on mobility.","López Soler, Juan Ramón Christidis Panayotis Vassallo José Manuel",Sustainability,https://doi.org/10.3390/su13137211,141

We discuss patterns in student reasoning on each question then discuss themes that appeared across questions. We identify conceptual resources that students frequently used to reason about the interview tasks and compare them to prior work. We observed graduate students commonly thinking about entropy in relationship to a number of states, even in situations where such a connection was not directly relevant. Graduate students also frequently made direct associations between entropy and temperature, despite there being no general, explicit relationship between the two quantities. On the whole, graduate students demonstrated adaptability and metacognitive awareness in their approach to reasoning about entropy.","Crossette, Nathan; Vignal, Michael; Wilcox, Bethany R.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.13488v1.pdf,141

Combining conserved antigens inducing cross-protective antibody response with epitopes activating cross-protective cytotoxic T-cells would offer an attractive strategy for developing universal vaccine. In this study, we constructed a recombinant protein NMHC consisting of influenza viral conserved epitopes and superantigen fragment. NMHC promoted the mature of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells and induced CD4+ T cells to differentiate into Th1, Th2 and Th17 subtypes. Mice vaccinated with NMHC produced high level of immunoglobulins which cross-bound to HA fragments from six influenza virus subtypes with high antibody titers. Anti-NMHC serum showed potent hemagglutinin inhibition effects to highly divergent group 1 (H1 subtypes) and group 2 (H3 subtype) influenza virus strains. And purified anti-NMHC antibodies could bind to multiple HAs with high affinities. NMHC vaccination effectively protected the mice from infection and lung damage challenged by two subtypes of H1N1 influenza virus. Moreover, NMHC vaccination elicited CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses to clear the virus from infected tissue and prevent virus spreading. In conclusion, this study provided proof of concept for triggering both B cells and T cells immune responses against multiple influenza virus infection, and NMHC may be a potential candidate of universal broad-spectrum vaccine for various influenza virus prevention and therapy.","Li, Yansheng; Xu, Mingkai; Li, Yongqiang; Gu, Wu; Halimu, Gulinare; Li, Yuqi; Zhang, Zhichun; Zhou, Libao; Liao, Hui; Yao, Songyuan; Zhang, Huiwen; Zhang, Chenggang",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.08.451596,141
175633,Estimation of COVID-19 recovery and decease periods in Canada using machine learning algorithms,2021-07-22,"Over the past year, many countries have resorted multiple times to drastic social restrictions to prevent saturation of their health care system, and to regain control over an otherwise exponentially increasing SARS-Covid-19 pandemic evolution. With the advent of data-sharing, computational approaches have gained a key role in evaluating future scenarios and offering predictions in a constantly evolving social environment. To design optimal social, hospitalization and economical strategies that guarantee control over the pandemic progression, we developed a data-driven modelling framework with the aim to provide reliable near future predictions under constantly evolving social and pandemic events. The framework is flexible enough to be used at a single hospital, regional or national level. We used a variety of data such as social, serological, testing and clinical data to compute the infection dynamics and the hospital workload for France. We developed inference methods to calibrate model parameters from observed hospitalization statistics over adjustable time periods. We applied our model to study the age stratified pandemic evolution inside and outside hospitals until February 2021, and the competition between vaccinations and the novel delta variant. We obtained several predictions about hidden pandemic properties such as fractions of infected, infection hospitality and infection fatality ratios. We show that reproduction numbers and herd immunity levels are not universal but strongly depend on the underlying social dynamics. We find that with normal social interactions the present vaccination status and rate is not sufficient to prevent a new pandemic wave driven by the delta variant.","Reingruber, J.; Papale, A.; Ruckly, S.; Timsit, J.-F.; Holcman, D.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.28.21260870v1?rss=1,141

To demonstrate the utility of base editor screens to probe small molecule-protein interactions, we conduct screens with BH3 mimetics and PARP inhibitors and identify point mutations that confer drug sensitivity or resistance. Finally, we create a library of 52,034 clinically-observed variants in 3,584 genes and conduct screens in the presence of cellular stressors, identifying loss-of-function variants in numerous DNA damage repair genes.

With data from the Metropolitan Police for the whole of the Metropolitan area of London, we use a difference-in-differences approach to examine what happened to hate crimes against Chinese people in London in the months before (October to December 2019) and the months after the Covid-19 pandemic (January to March 2020) relative to other ethnic groups, to other crimes, and to other time periods. Our methodology utilizes the fact that Covid-19 came as an unexpected shock, which very quickly changed the environment for crime, and did so differentially across ethnicities. We argue that this shock is likely to negatively affect attitudes and behaviors toward Chinese people, but has no effect on other ethnicities. Our results show that in the months after Covid-19, there was an increase in hate crimes against Chinese people, but this increase was not seen among the other ethnic groups, other non hate crimes, or in any other time period. This leads us to conclude that Covid-19 led to an increase in hate crimes against Chinese people in London. That Covid-19 changed behavior toward Chinese people highlights an intrinsic link between Covid-19 and racism. Unfortunately, the rise in hate crime that we identify adds to a growing list of ways in which ethnic minority groups disproportionately suffered, and continue to do so, during the pandemic.","Gray, Chelsea Hansen Kirstine",Journal of Contemporary Criminal Justice,https://doi.org/10.1177/10439862211027994,141

Well-founded concerns according to which the pandemic-induced closure of educational facilities and the shift to digitalized distance education are contributing to increased social inequality in education serve as a starting point for the argumentation. The paper contends that together with the temporary changes in the style of educational governance, in the medium term an exacerbated social inequality in education can cause a potential trust problem for the central actors imposing the measures. To support this line of reasoning, the exploratory study describes the context conditions which are relevant for the implementation and participation in digitalized distance education (measures, access and competent use of digital devices in education, level of trust) and combines them with the findings of a qualitative analysis of relevant documents from three European countries (Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany).

The traditional route of administration for Mw is intradermal, which has a limitation of administering 0.1 mL per injection and local injection site reaction. Intravenous (IV) administration of Mw has not been explored in COVID-19. We report the retrospective analysis of six critically ill COVID-19 patients who received Mw (IV). Patients and methods: At baseline, all patients in this case series required O-2 supplementation, and their inflammatory biomarkers were elevated. All patients received 0.6 mL Mw (high-dose) in normal saline along with the standard-of-care treatment. Results: After Mw administration, gradual improvement in O-2 requirement was observed and patients were discharged from the hospital with no mortality. A reduction in mean c-reactive protein (CRP) (51.48-18.52 mg/dL), interleukin-6 (IL-6) (260.22-14.47 pg/mL), and FiO(2) (81.67-43.33) was also observed.

Recent emergence and proliferation of WELL certification program that prioritizes human health has evoked new questions about its effectiveness in relation to IAQ. To investigate the effectiveness of the WELL certification, we have quantitatively compared IAQ results before and after relocation to two WELL-certified office buildings using the same cohort of occupants. Physical measures included integrated samples of TVOC, individual VOC, formaldehyde and acetaldehyde, NO2, SO2, O3 and longitudinal records of CO2 and size-resolved particles. Complementary survey responses about satisfaction with IAQ and thermal comfort were collected from ~250 employees. For the majority of air pollutants, there was no significant concentration difference between non-WELL and WELL buildings, but not always. The WELL-certified buildings had substantially higher levels of TVOC and individual VOC associated with paints, especially shortly after the relocation.

We describe demographic features, treatments and clinical outcomes in the International Severe Acute Respiratory and emerging Infection Consortium (ISARIC) COVID-19 cohort, the world's largest international, standardised cohort of hospitalised patients. Methods: The dataset analysed includes COVID-19 patients hospitalised between January 2020 and May 2021. We investigated how symptoms on admission, comorbidities, risk factors, and treatments varied by age, sex, and other characteristics. We used Cox proportional hazards models to investigate associations between demographics, symptoms, comorbidities, and other factors with risk of death, admission to intensive care unit (ICU), and invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). Findings: 439,922 patients with laboratory-confirmed (91.7%) or clinically-diagnosed (8.3%) SARS-CoV-2 infection from 49 countries were enrolled. Age (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] per 10 years 1.49 [95% CI 1.49-1.50]) and male sex (1.26 [1.24-1.28]) were associated with a higher risk of death. Rates of admission to ICU and use of IMV increased with age up to age 60, then dropped. Symptoms, comorbidities, and treatments varied by age and had varied associations with clinical outcomes. Tuberculosis was associated with an 86% higher risk of death, and HIV with an 87% higher risk of death. Case fatality ratio varied by country partly due to differences in the clinical characteristics of recruited patients. Interpretation: The size of our international database and the standardized data collection method makes this study a reliable and comprehensive international description of COVID-19 clinical features. This is a viable model to be applied to future epidemics.","ISARIC Clinical Characterisation Group,; Kartsonaki, C.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.09.11.21263419v1?rss=1,141

UBS is a concept often paired with UBI, and UBV is considered a middle way between UBI (cash) and UBS (in-kind). This study first analyzes Korea’s basic income, basic service, and basic voucher cases, according to Bohnenberger’s nine types of social benefits through Standing’s policy evaluation principles. Additionally, we evaluated how each of the benefits included in basic income, basic service, and basic voucher can contribute to social and ecological sustainability in the Korean context. Through this evaluation, to pursue SET in the future, what kind of policy efforts should be accompanied with basic income through a Korean case analysis was discussed. The paper focuses on Korea in particular, as all three policies have been initiated here.","Sophia Seung-Yoon, Lee Lee Ji-eun",Sustainability,https://doi.org/10.3390/su12208348,141

We compared concussion rates among high school lacrosse players wearing versus not wearing lacrosse headgear. Methods: Study participants included a sample of convenience of high schools with girls' lacrosse from across the United States. Certified athletic trainers reported athlete exposure and injury data via the National Athletic Treatment, Injury and Outcomes Network during the 2019 through 2021 seasons. The Headgear cohort was inclusive of high schools from the state of Florida, which mandate the use of ASTM standard F3137 headgear, while the Non-Headgear cohort was inclusive of the remaining states, none of which have headgear mandates. Incidence Rate Ratios (IRR) and 95% Confidence Intervals (CI) were calculated. IRRs with corresponding CIs that excluded 1.00 were deemed statistically significant. Results: 141 concussions (Headgear: 25; Non-Headgear: 116) and 357,225 Athlete Exposures (AE) were reported (Headgear: 91,074AE; Non-Headgear: 266,151AE) across all games and practices. Overall, the concussion injury rate per 1000AE was significantly higher in the Non-Headgear cohort (0.44) than the Headgear Cohort (0.27) (IRR=1.59, 95% CI:1.03 - 2.45). The IRR was significantly higher for the Non-Headgear cohort during games (1.74, 95% CI: 1.00, 3.02) but not for practices (1.42, 95% CI: 0.71, 2.83). Conclusions: These findings indicate that concussion rates among high school girls' lacrosse players not wearing headgear were 59% higher than those wearing headgear. These data support the use of protective headgear to reduce the risk of concussion among high school female lacrosse athletes.","Herman, D. C.; Caswell, S. V.; Kelshaw, P. M.; Vincent, H.

Yet, we know little about the transition of students from school/college to distance learning higher education. This study drew from survey responses of 377 first-year students, aged 18–19, at The Open University, UK. This study aimed to explore the motivations of students who join distance learning universities and to examine their early experiences. Findings showed that the main motivations for joining distance learning higher education include flexible study alongside other commitments, earning money alongside their studies, and demonstrating self-motivation. Motivations for joining were significantly different among various student groups. Further, the decision of 22% of the respondents to study via distance learning was impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic. ‘Course structure’ was identified as the factor that supported them the most with their transition from school/college to a distance learning university, while ‘interactions with students’ was identified as the main area of suggested improvement. This study has gone some way towards enhancing our understanding of the expectations and needs of first-year distance learning students.

However, true case estimations have been elusive due to lack of testing and diagnostic capacity, asymptomatic cases, and individuals who do not get tested or seek care. Concomitantly, new digital surveillance tools to detect, characterize, and report COVID-19 cases are emerging, including using structured and unstructured data from users self-reporting COVID-19-related experiences on the Internet and social media platforms. In this study, we develop and evaluate a hybrid unsupervised and supervised machine learning approach to detect self-reported COVID-19-related symptoms on Twitter during the early stages of the pandemic. Tweets were collected from the public API stream from March 3rd-31st 2020, filtered for COVID-19-related terms. We used the biterm topic model to cluster tweets into theme-associated groups for the first 18 days of tweets, which were then extracted and manually annotated to identify users self-reporting suspected COVID-19 symptoms or status. Using this manually annotated data as a training set, we used an XLNet deep learning model for classifying symptom-related tweets from a larger corpus and also evaluated model performance. From 4, 492, 954 tweets collected, the unsupervised learning process yielded 3, 465 (<1%) symptom tweets used to form our ground-truth COVID-19 symptoms dataset (n = 11, 550). The XLNet text classifier achieved the highest accuracy (.91) and f1 (.62) compared to baseline models evaluated for classification. After re-training with adjusted loss function, we boosted the classifier's precision to 0.81 while maintaining a high f1 (0.66), resulting in identification of an additional 2, 622 symptom-related tweets when applied to an additional 11 days of tweets collected. Our study used a hybrid machine learning approach to enable high precision identification of Twitter user-generated COVID-19 symptom discussions. The model is a digital epidemiology tool that can identify social media users who self-report symptoms during the early periods of an outbreak. © 2021 IEEE.","Cai, M.; Li, J.; Nali, M.; MacKey, T.

The dynamics of directly-transmitted infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, are usually described by compartmental models where individuals are classified as susceptible, infected and removed. These SIR models typically assume homogenous transmission of infection, even in large populations, a simplification that is convenient but inconsistent with observations. Here we use original data on the dynamics of COVID-19 spread in a Brazilian city to investigate the structure of the transmission network. We find that transmission can be described by a network in which each infectious individual has a small number of susceptible contacts, of the order of 2-5, which is independent of total population size. Compared with standard models of homogenous mixing, this scale-free, fractal infection process gives a better description of COVID-19 dynamics through time. In addition, the contact process explains the geographically localized clusters of disease seen in this Brazilian city.

A cross-sectional phase in this study will gather more evidence concerning this topic. A longitudinal phase will explore the efficacy of a biofeedback intervention based on Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia (RSA) in adolescents with ASD. Finally, a feasibility study will focus on a nonsupervised RSA biofeedback intervention in this population. Methods: The cross-sectional phase includes the comparison of adolescents with ASD (n=38) and age and gender matched typically developing peers. A standardized assessment will be used which contains physiological, cortisol and behavioral measurements. The longitudinal phase contains a randomized, single-blinded and sham-controlled design to determine the efficacy of supervised RSA biofeedback in adolescents with ASD (n=128). A follow-up phase of 5 weeks is included to evaluate the presence of retention effects. During the latter, a feasibility study will focus on a non-supervised intervention (n=62). Assessments as described previously are scheduled after the intervention and the follow-up phase. Discussion: First, more conclusive evidence will be provided for the presence of lower cardiac vagal modulation in adolescents with ASD as well as the association between these lower values and physiological and behavioral indices. Second, the supervised intervention in adolescents with ASD is hypothesized to upregulate this cardiac vagal modulation and positively change behavioral and physiological parameters. Third, evidence regarding the feasibility and acceptability of a non-supervised intervention may open novel avenues for home-based interventions in this population.","Thoen, A.; Steyaert, J.; Alaerts, K.; Van Damme, T.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.27.21252570v1?rss=1,141

This study has been examined under the category of biological disasters, since the opposite has not been proven definitively from the beginning of the epidemic process of Corona. The hypothesis of our study is based on the fact that disadvantaged groups of people carry out a serious struggle for survival during epidemic periods. Due to the necessity of certain and fundamental solutions regarding this fact, in the last part of our study, suggestions were made on how these groups, including street vendors, can participate in the management. Disadvantaged groups are the groups most affected by these crises in times of local, regional, national, or international disasters and crises. These are categorised into the poor, children, women victims of violence, disabled people, elderly people, immigrants, addicts, and chronic patients. Our study focussed on the poor (those who work infor-mally) and immigrants (immigrants, asylum seekers, and refugees) from these disadvantaged groups. In particular, the poor and immigrants can be provided with dominant missions in the provision and distribution of public goods and/or services carried out by states through the central or local government, and the process can be completed much more successfully. For example, particularly, in the distribution of aid, in the formation of response teams, in the feeding of street animals, in public administration, etc. It is possible for them to participate in the management of public goods and service provision in other very important tasks.

This epidemic has brought a risk of death in the daily activity (physical and social) participation that influences travellers’ physical, social, and mental health. To analyze the impact of the COVID-19-induced daily activities on health parameters of higher education institutes, 150 students of the Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS, Perak, Malaysia, were surveyed through an online web survey using random sampling techniques. The data were analyzed through RStudio and SPSS using multilevel linear regression analysis and Hierarchical Structural Equation Modeling. The estimated results indicate that restricting individuals from doing out-of-home activities negatively influences physical and social health. A unit increase in the in-home maintenance activities during the COVID-19 pandemic introduced a daily increase of 0.5% in physical health. Moreover, a unit increase in the in-home activities at leisure time represents a 1% positive improvement in social health. Thus, physical activity has proven to be beneficial in improving physical and social health with severe COVID-19.

Here, this problem is addressed using a metapopulation approach to consider the inhomogeneous transmission of the spread arising from a variety of reasons, like the distribution of local epidemic onset times or of the transmission rates. We show that these contributions can be incorporated into a susceptible-infected-recovered framework through a time-dependent transmission rate. Thus, the reproduction number decreases with time despite the population dynamics remaining uniform and the depletion of susceptible individuals is small. The obtained results are consistent with the early subexponential growth observed in the cumulated number of confirmed cases even in the absence of containment measures. We validate our model by describing the evolution of COVID-19 using real data from different countries, with an emphasis in the case of Mexico, and show that it also correctly describes the longtime dynamics of the spread. The proposed model yet simple is successful at describing the onset and progression of the outbreak, and considerably improves the accuracy of predictions over traditional compartmental models. The insights given here may prove to be useful to forecast the extent of the public health risks of the epidemics, thus improving public policy-making aimed at reducing such risks.","Mendoza, C.

This exploratory paper proposes an innovative Social Synergy sukuk (Double-S sukuk) for alleviating the alarming upsurge in extreme poverty triggered by the pandemic in the face of limited resources. The Double-S sukuk is designed with Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs);such as Islamic Development Bank subscribing to the sukuk at a discounted profit rate, issued by a country facing the pains of the pandemic. The profit will be paid by a charitable Non-Governmental Organization;such as Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation as an incentive to the crises country contingent upon judicious utilization of the funds for the pre-agreed social targets achieved within timely milestones that trickle down to uplift the citizens from the pandemic pains of extreme poverty. The country will only pay the principal component. Furthermore, a suitable MDB;such as Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) will issue a charitable guarantee to enhance the sukuk rating and cut issuance costs. This enhancement makes the sukuk an attractive BASEL III High-quality-liquid-asset (HQLA). Instead of begging the public for charity, the Double-S sukuk will be open to the public to invest alongside MDBs for a discounted profit rate to crowd-in the social/ethical conscious private sector to raise cheaper and larger funds for an apt synergistic crisis alleviation.

Companies participating in the sharing economy choose to withdraw from the market because it is always difficult to make a profit, due to heavy asset investment, but there is no such worry for owners who do not need cost input. At the same time, we have observed that the sharing products launched by companies are difficult to meet the rental needs of consumers. Based on the above findings, we have constructed a model where there is a market where a monopolistic manufacturer sells and rents out at the same time, and owners who purchased new products can choose to rent out products when they are idle. Because of the uncoordinated supply and demand matching of the sharing market and the excessively high unit cost input, our research found that: (1) the barriers for the manufacturer to enter the sharing market are always high—for example, the manufacturer will choose to enter the sharing market only when consumers have a high rate of availability of sharing products. Only when the cost of products in the sharing market is not low will the manufacturer choose to provide sharing services;(2) the competition between the two products in the sharing market weakens the demand cannibalize in the sales market;(3) the manufacturer enters the sharing market to promote the owner’s income.

This phenomenon has yet to be directly explored in episodic memory, nor explored for reaction times or physiological correlates. We designed a novel method to elicit the DKE via a test of item recognition while electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded. Throughout the task, participants were asked to estimate the percentile in which they performed compared to others. Results revealed participants in the bottom 25th percentile overestimated their percentile, while participants in the top 75th percentile underestimated their percentile, exhibiting the classic DKE. Reaction time measures revealed a condition x group interaction whereby over-estimators responded faster than under-estimators when estimating being in the top percentile and responded slower when estimating being in the bottom percentile. Between-group EEG differences were evident between over-estimators and under-estimators during Dunning-Kruger responses, which revealed FN400-like effects of familiarity supporting differences for over-estimators from 400-600 ms, whereas ‘old-new’ memory ERP effects revealed a late parietal component (LPC) associated with recollection-based processing from 600-900 ms for under-estimators that was not evident for over-estimators. Findings suggest over- and under-estimators use differing cognitive processes when assessing their performance, such that under-estimators rely on recollection during memory and over-estimators draw upon excess familiarity when over-estimating their performance. Episodic memory thus appears to play a contributory role in metacognitive judgments of illusory superiority and inferiority. Graphical Abstract Event-related potentials (ERPS) were recorded for the Dunning-Kruger Effect as subjects made metacognitive judgments about performance on a memory task. Over- and Under-estimators exhibited a crossover interaction in response times when believing they did best and worst, respectively. A crossover pattern was also observed for ERPs: LPC signals of recollection were found for under-estimators, whereas familiarity-based FN400 effects were evident for over-estimators and correlated with estimates.","Muller, Alana; Sirianni, Lindsey A.; Addante, Richard J.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2019.12.26.888511,141
179607,Agroforestry-Based Ecosystem Services: Reconciling Values of Humans and Nature in Sustainable Development,2021,"IntroductionMental health concerns are common in health care workers during pandemic. There are no studies of the prevalence of health anxiety in ophthalmologists in India.ObjectivesTo estimate the prevalence of health anxiety in ophthalmologists practicing in India during the ongoing pandemic.MethodsA questionnaire-based online survey on the “changes and challenges during COVID-19” using Google forms was sent to all members of the All India Ophthalmological Society. Besides demographics, the survey had questions to assess the general mental and medical health status of the ophthalmologists. Short Health Anxiety Inventory (SHAI) was used to assess health anxiety.Results1027 ophthalmologists responded to the study. Higher stress was experience by 83.1% compared to pre-COVID while examining patients closely (35.9%) or during surgery due to the risk of aerosol generation (29.3%). SHAI score >20 was observed in 5.6%. Only emergency services were being provided by 50% and 17% in the SHAI > 20 group were not working as compared to overall 14%.ConclusionsOur findings indicate that a majority of the ophthalmologists were under stress during the COVID-19 pandemic but only a small proportion experienced health anxiety. It is likely that mental health issues may arise among ophthalmologists in the foreseeable future.","C, K.",European Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1192/j.eurpsy.2021.502,141

Whereas those think about collectively affirm the moderating impact of social removing on illness spread, the detailed viability changes from 10% to more than 90%, lessening the number of diseases. For the most part, this level of instability is due to the complex elements of scourges and their time-variant parameters. In any case, genuine value-based information can diminish vulnerability and give a less loud picture of social removal’s viability. In any case, individuals, as a rule, don’t take note of their removal, and here comes the part of Artificial Intelligence (AI).

The prospective use of such applications has produced several debates surrounding confidentiality, security, data supervision, closeness approximation algorithms, and cyber-attack susceptibility. This paper discusses these concerns in the context of a novel smartphone application architecture, proposed here, that gives users more control and privacy during contact tracing. The proposed application is termed COVIDFREE App, which is aimed at enhancing users' situational awareness through communication of safe and unsafe locations. An overview of the app's architectural design and functionality are presented, including a newly developed Overall Risk Density Safety Factor calculation inspired by COVID-19 density risks and factors of users based on health requirements and several customizable user-specific scenarios.

180437,Pursuing the SDG11 Targets: The Role of the Sustainability Protocols,2021,"As global vaccination campaigns against SARS-CoV-2 proceed, there is emerging interest in the longevity of immune protection, especially with regard to increasingly infectious virus variants. Neutralizing antibodies (Nabs) targeting the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 are promising correlates of protective immunity and have been successfully used for prevention and therapy. To assess neutralizing capacity, we developed a bead-based multiplex ACE2 RBD competition assay as a large scalable, time-, cost-, and material-saving alternative to infectious live-virus neutralization tests. By mimicking the interaction between ACE2 and RBD, this assay detects the presence of Nabs against SARS-CoV2 in serum. Using this multiplex approach allows the simultaneous analysis of Nabs against all SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern and variants of interest in a single well. Following validation, we analyzed 325 serum samples from 186 COVID-19 patients of varying severity. Neutralization capacity was reduced for all variants examined compared to wild-type, especially for those displaying the E484K mutation. The neutralizing immune response itself, while highly individualistic, positively correlates with IgG levels. Neutralization capacity also correlated with disease severity up to WHO grade 7, after which it reduced.","Junker, D.; Dulovic, A.; Becker, M.; Wagner, T. R.; Kaiser, P.

Surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) based direct detection of spike protein was investigated by fabricating silver nanoparticles decorated Si (AgNPs/Si) using a facile wet chemical process. Fabrication parameters such as immersion time and precursor concentration were varied;their corresponding morphological characteristics were well elucidated while assuring homogeneous decoration of AgNPs on Si substrate. Classical dye molecule such as rhodamine 6G (R6G) was utilised for the optimisation of fabricated sensor. Based on acquired intensity of R6G, the best sensor was selected, which was further employed for label free direction of spike protein. The developed sensor exhibited high sensitivity in pico-molar range with excellent reproducibility. Selectivity studies were demonstrated using DNA and H1N1 protein as well.

Here we propose a simulation-based method to detect positions under convergent evolution in large protein alignments, without prior knowledge on the phenotype and environmental constraints. A phylogeny is inferred from the data and used in simulations to estimate the expected number of amino-acid changes in stable evolutionary constraints (null model) for each position. Similarly, we count the number of mutations towards the same amino acid in the data and test if they are occurring more often than expected. We applied our method to two real datasets: HIV reverse transcriptase and fish rhodopsin, and to HIV-like simulated data. On the latter, with known convergent events and substitution model, we detected on average two third of these events, with a low fraction of false positives. With HIV data, one knows that drug resistance mutations (DRMs) are convergent. Even without any knowledge of patient treatment status, we retrieved more than 70% of positions corresponding to known DRMs. On the rhodopsin dataset, four substitutions are supposed to be convergent, as they change the maximum wavelength absorption of the photoreceptor and occurred several times independently during evolution. We detected three of them. These results demonstrate the potential of the method to target specific mutations to be further studied experimentally or, for example, using a nonsynonymous/synonymous rate ratio approach.

To address this hypothesis, we present an intuitive approach for quantifying interactions between clusters of sexual behaviour along a virus phylogeny. Data from the Swiss HIV Cohort Study on condom use and incident Hepatitis C virus (HCV) sequences served as proof-of-concept. A strict inclusion criteria contrasting with relatively low HCV prevalence hindered our ability to identify significant relationships.

Most COPD management is currently based on a reactive approach, and delays in recognising treatable opportunities underpin COPD care-quality gaps. Innovations which can empower patient self-management, facilitate integrated clinical care and support delivery of evidence-based treatment interventions are urgently required. Methods and analysis: The RECEIVER trial is a prospective observational cohort hybrid implementation and effectiveness study that will test the adoption of a digital service model for ""high-risk"" COPD patients and evaluate the performance of this approach versus current standards of care. Patients with a recent severe exacerbation and/or COPD-OSA overlap or chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure requiring home NIV or CPAP, with access to smartphone, tablet or computer will be recruited into the study and enrolled into the digital service. Study endpoints will examine patient utilisation, clinical service impact and clinical outcomes compared to historical and contemporary COPD control patient data. The digital infrastructure for this support of routine clinical care will also provide a foundation to explore the feasibility of approaches to predict outcomes and exacerbations in COPD patients through machine-learning analysis.

181522,We Can Do It for Free!,2021,"Translation of SARS-CoV-2-encoded mRNAs by the host ribosomes is essential for its propagation. Following infection, the early expressed viral protein NSP1 binds the ribosome, represseses translation and induces mRNA degradation, while the host elicits anti-viral response. The mechanisms enabling viral mRNAs to escape this multifaceted repression remain obscure. Here we show that expression of NSP1 leads to destabilization of multi-exon cellular mRNAs, while intron-less transcripts, such as viral mRNAs and anti-viral interferon genes, remain relatively stable. We identified a conserved and precisely located cap-proximal RNA element devoid of guanosines that confers resistance to NSP1-meidated translation inhibition. Importantly, the primary sequence rather than the secondary structure is critical for protection. We further show that the genomic 5’UTR of SARS-CoV-2 exhibits an IRES-like activity and promotes expression of NSP1 in an eIF4E-independent and Torin-1 resistant manner. Upon expression, NSP1 enhances cap-independent translation. However, the sub-genomic 5’UTRs are highly sensitive to eIF4E availability, rendering viral propagation partially sensitive to Torin-1. The combined NSP1-mediated degradation of spliced mRNAs and translation inhibition of single-exon genes, along with the unique features present in the viral 5’UTRs, ensure robust expression of viral mRNAs. These features can be exploited as potential therapeutic targets.","Slobodin, Boris; Sehrawat, Urmila; Lev, Anastasia; Ogran, Ariel; Fraticelli, Davide; Hayat, Daniel; Zuckerman, Binyamin; Ulitsky, Igor; Ben-Shmuel, Amir; Bar-David, Elad; Levy, Haim; Dikstein, Rivka",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.18.456855,141

While a large body of research focuses on the inputs (members? skills, motivation, technology, and virtuality) and outcomes (satisfaction, performance, and learning) of virtual teamwork, to date, only a limited number of studies have explored virtual teamwork processes involving university students. By drawing on the team processes model (Marks et al., 2001), in this qualitative study, we extend the scope of virtual team processes to a university online course. In addition, we explore transition, action, and interpersonal processes that undergraduate students experience when learning in virtual teams. The study participants included Japanese and international students (N = 20) from three universities in Japan taking a synchronous online course in international organizations during the summer of 2020;15 combinations of virtual teams were created. The study is based on the inductive content analysis of e-portfolios created and managed by students taking the online course. The findings show that virtual teams are multitasking entities that transition through multiple processes simultaneously and consequentially to achieve team goals. From the analyzed e-portfolios, it can be observed that across all themes, systems monitoring (action processes), affect management (interpersonal processes), and strategy formulation and planning (transition processes) have been crucial in invigorating virtual teams toward task accomplishment. Finally, the study discusses both theoretical and practical implications.","Ismailov, Murod Laurier Joël",E-Learning and Digital Media,https://doi.org/10.1177/20427530211039710,141

But online education has thus far been primarily limited to teaching of knowledge and cognitive skills. There is yet almost no use of online education for teaching of physical clinical skills. In this paper, we present a shared haptic virtual environment for dental surgical skill training. The system provides the teacher and student with a shared environment containing a virtual dental station with patient, a dental drill controlled by a haptic device, and a drillable tooth. It also provides automated scoring of procedure outcomes. We discuss a number of optimizations used in order to provide the high-fidelity simulation and real-time performance needed for training of high-precision clinical skills. Since tactile, in particular kinaesthetic, sense is essential in carrying out many dental procedures, an important question is how to best teach this in a virtual environment. In order to support exploring this, our system includes three modes for transmitting haptic sensations from the user performing the procedure to the user observing.","Kaluschke, M.; Yin, M.

186700,THE STATE AS A GUARANTOR OF THE PROTECTION OF THE RIGHTS OF INDIVIDUALS AND LEGAL ENTITIES IN THE CONDITIONS OF CORONAVIRUS CRISIS OF 2020.,2020,"Mouse hepatitis virus JHM (JHMV or MHV-4) induces demyelination in rodents and has been studied as a model for the human disease, multiple sclerosis (MS). As is proposed in MS, the mechanism of subacute demyelination induced by JHMV appears to be primarily immunopathological, since demyelination in JHMV-infected mice is abrogated by immunosuppressive doses of irradiation and restored by adoptive transfer of splenocytes. Thy-1+ cells play a critical role in transmitting disease to these recipient mice. To further characterize cells which may mediate JHMV-induced immunopathology, we inoculated congenitally immunodeficient mice with JHMV. By 12 days post-inoculation, both immunocompetent C57BL/6J controls and athymic nude C57BL/6 mice had severe paralysis and demyelination. In marked contrast, C57BL/6 mice with the severe combined immune deficiency (SCID) mutation had little or no paralysis or demyelination. Adoptive transfer of immune spleen cells from nude mice to infected SCID mice produced paralysis and demyelination. These findings suggest that a cell population present in immunocompetent C57BL/6J and nude mice but absent or non-functional in irradiated and SCID mice is essential for JHMV-induced demyelination. Identification of cells which mediate demyelination in this experimental system may have implications for our understanding of coronavirus pathogenesis and human demyelinating diseases.","Houtman, J J; Hinze, H C; Fleming, J O",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8830473/,141

The Weill Cornell service describes the phases of the pandemic to depict its temporal evolution and subsequent ethical challenges. Both sites report that the predominant ethical challenges centered around end-of-life decision making, setting goals of care, and medical futility, all complicated by resource allocation questions and the ambiguity of state law under crisis standards of care. The Columbia campus saw a statistically significant increase in ethics consultations provided to Hispanic patients, perhaps reflective of the disproportionate burden of COVID-19 suffered by this demographic. While Weill Cornell and Columbia saw a surge in clinical ethics consultations, the two services assumed a more expansive role than one normally played in institutional life. Serving as intermediaries between frontline clinicians and senior hospital administrators, consultants provided critical intelligence to hospital leadership about the evolution of the pandemic, disseminated information to clinicians, and attended to the moral distress of colleagues who were asked to provide care under truly extraordinary circumstances. The COVID-19 surge in New York City revealed latent capabilities in ethics consultation that may prove useful to the broader clinical ethics community as it responds to the current pandemic and reconceptualizes its potential for future service.","Fins, Joseph J; Prager, Kenneth M",The Journal of clinical ethics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32773405/,141
191578,Distance Education and Pedagogy for Radiologic Science Programs.,2021-05-01,"Twenty-four beagles were used to measure physiological and behavioral reactions to air transport. Each of 3 groups of 4 sedated (with 0.5 mg/kg body weight of acepromazine maleate) and 4 non-sedated (control) dogs was flown on a separate flight between Montreal, Quebec, and Toronto, Ontario, after being transported by road from Quebec City to Montreal. Saliva and blood samples were taken before ground and air transport and after air transport. The heart rate was monitored during the whole experiment except during ground transport, and behavior was monitored by video during air transport. Sedation did not affect any of the variables measured. The mean plasma cortisol concentration was significantly higher (P < 0.05) after ground transport than at baseline (225.3 vs 134.5 nmol/L); the mean salivary cortisol concentration was significantly higher (P < 0.05) after both ground and air transport than at baseline (16.2 and 14.8, respectively, vs 12.6 nmol/L). The mean neutrophil count was significantly higher (P < 0.05) after both ground and air transport than at baseline (80.6 and 81.4, respectively, vs 69.5 per 100 white blood cells), whereas the mean lymphocyte count was significantly lower (P < 0.05) (13.2 and 13.7, respectively, vs 22.4 per 100 white blood cells). Loading and unloading procedures caused the largest increase in heart rate. On average, the dogs spent more than 50% of the time lying down, and they remained inactive for approximately 75% of the time, except during take-off. These results suggest that transportation is stressful for dogs and that sedation with acepromazine, at the dosage and timing used, does not affect the physiological and behavioral stress responses of dogs to air transport.","Bergeron, Renée; Scott, Shannon L; Emond, Jean-Pierre; Mercier, Florent; Cook, Nigel J; Schaefer, Al L",Canadian journal of veterinary research = Revue canadienne de recherche veterinaire,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12146895/,141

Time Series Analysis Using Bayesian Local Linear Trend Model.,2021-03-25,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW Acute lung injury and its extreme manifestation, acute respiratory distress syndrome, complicate a wide variety of serious medical and surgical conditions, only some of which affect the lung directly. Despite recent evidence-based advances in clinical management, acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome are associated with significant mortality. Detailed epidemiology is essential in guiding the recruitment of patients into trials of new therapeutic interventions, thereby improving outcome and allowing directed allocation of scarce resources. RECENT FINDINGS The incidence of acute lung injury in the United States overall (17-64 per 100,000 person-years) seems to be higher than in Europe, Australia, and other developed countries (17-34 per 100, 000 person-years). The mortality rates for patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome range from 34 to 58%. The hypothesis that pulmonary and extrapulmonary acute respiratory distress syndromes are different disease entities continues to gain momentum. A genetic predisposition to acute respiratory distress syndrome may contribute to its pathogenesis and outcome. SUMMARY Recent epidemiologic studies of the incidence of acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome have indicated a similar incidence in developed societies, and they confirm that mortality is falling in comparison with a decade ago. The awaited publication of new consensus guidelines for the definition of acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome may render new studies necessary.","MacCallum, Niall S; Evans, Timothy W",Current opinion in critical care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15659944/,141

Peptides represent a simple, safe and adaptable basis for vaccine development; however, the potency of peptide vaccines is insufficient in most cases for significant therapeutic efficacy. Several methods, such as Ligand Epitope Antigen Presentation System and ISCOMATRIX, have been developed to enhance the potency of peptide vaccines. One way of increasing the loading of MHC class II peptides occurs through the use of Ii-Key technology. Ii-Key (LRMK), a portion of the MHC class II-associated invariant chain (Ii), facilitates the direct loading of epitopes to the MHC class II molecule groove. Linking the Ii-Key moiety via a simple polymethylene bridge to an MHC class II epitope, to generate an Ii-Key/MHC class II epitope hybrid, greatly enhances the vaccine potency of the tethered epitope. The combination of such Ii-Key/MHC class II epitope hybrids with MHC class I epitope-containing peptides might generate a potent peptide vaccine for malignancies and infectious diseases. The Ii-Key hybrid technology is compared with other methods that enhance the potency of a peptide vaccine.","Kallinteris, Nikoletta L; Lu, Xueqing; Blackwell, Catherine E; von Hofe, Eric; Humphreys, Robert E; Xu, Minzhen",Expert opinion on biological therapy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17223739/,141

Anxiety has been associated with poor diet quality and weight gain, which may lead to obesity, a risk factor for adverse COVID-19 outcomes. The present study was designed to examine associations between diet quality and anxiety levels during the COVID-19 pandemic. SUBJECTS/METHODS: This cross-sectional, international online study was conducted between March 30 and April 25, 2020 and available in seven languages: Arabic (7.6%), English (43.7%), French (0.8%), Hebrew (42.1%), Italian (3%), Russian (1.1%), and Spanish (1.6%). Diet quality was assessed using the Mediterranean Diet Score (possible range: 0-17 points) and anxiety scored using the General Anxiety Disorder 7-point scale (GAD-7). The Google Survey platform was used to conduct the survey. RESULTS: A total of 3797 persons were included in the present analysis. More than 75% of respondents were female; most completed the survey in English or Hebrew. Median age was 31 (IQ = 18) years. Almost 60% indicated that their pre-pandemic diet was healthier than their current diet. The median Mediterranean diet score was 9 (IQ = 3). The majority (54%) of participants reported at least mild anxiety, while 25% reported moderate anxiety or more severe. In a logistic regression model of at least moderate anxiety, Mediterranean diet score (OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.89-0.95, p < 0.0001) reduced odds of elevated anxiety, even after controlling for age, sex and other variables. CONCLUSIONS: Though causality cannot be inferred, associations between diet quality and anxiety might suggest public health interventions including diet and stress control during future mass lockdowns.","Kaufman-Shriqui, Vered; Navarro, Daniela Abigail; Raz, Olga; Boaz, Mona",Eur. j. clin. nutr,,141

MeV is responsible for major morbidity and mortality in non-vaccinated populations. ERDRP-0519, a pan-morbillivirus small molecule inhibitor for the treatment of measles, targets the morbillivirus RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRP) complex and displayed unparalleled oral efficacy against lethal infection of ferrets with CDV, an established surrogate model for human measles. Resistance profiling identified the L subunit of the RdRP, which harbors all enzymatic activity of the polymerase complex, as the molecular target of inhibition. Here, we examined binding characteristics, physical docking site, and the molecular mechanism of action of ERDRP-0519 through label-free biolayer interferometry, photoaffinity cross-linking, and in vitro RdRP assays using purified MeV RdRP complexes and synthetic templates. Results demonstrate that unlike all other mononegavirus small molecule inhibitors identified to date, ERDRP-0519 inhibits all phosphodiester bond formation in both de novo initiation of RNA synthesis at the promoter and RNA elongation by a committed polymerase complex. Photocrosslinking and resistance profiling-informed ligand docking revealed that this unprecedented mechanism of action of ERDRP-0519 is due to simultaneous engagement of the L protein polyribonucleotidyl transferase (PRNTase)-like domain and the flexible intrusion loop by the compound, pharmacologically locking the polymerase in pre-initiation conformation. This study informs selection of ERDRP-0519 as clinical candidate for measles therapy and identifies a previously unrecognized druggable site in mononegavirus L polymerase proteins that can silence all synthesis of viral RNA.","Cox, Robert M; Sourimant, Julien; Govindarajan, Mugunthan; Natchus, Michael G; Plemper, Richard K",PLoS Pathog,,141

Here, we model infectious spread based on real spatio-temporal precise personal interactions from a geriatric unit and test different scenarios of robotic integration. We find a significant mitigation of contamination rates when robots specifically replace a moderate fraction of high-risk healthcare workers, who have a high number of contacts with patients and other HCW. While the impact of robotic integration is significant across a range of reproductive number R0, the largest effect is seen when R0 is slightly above its critical value.

In a novel general equilibrium model, we introduce epidemiological dynamics to the production network between China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). In this model, agents’ risk-averse behavior during pandemics leads to shifting demands across economic sectors. We calibrate the model with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) inter-country input-output tables for pre-SARS and pre-COVID-19 periods and control for disease dynamics across years. Findings show that in the absence of policy interventions, China’s greater significance in global value chains is associated with substantial economic impacts, within China and the ASEAN region.

205471,Pandemics within the pandemic: confronting socio-economic inequities in a datafied world,2021,"BACKGROUND: Endotheliopathy is a key element in COVID-19 pathophysiology, contributing to both morbidity and mortality. Biomarkers distinguishing different COVID-19 phenotypes from sepsis syndrome remain poorly understood. OBJECTIVE: To characterize circulating biomarkers of endothelial damage in different COVID-19 clinical disease stages compared with sepsis syndrome and normal volunteers. METHODS: Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia (nâ=â49) were classified into moderate, severe, or critical (life-threatening) disease. Plasma samples were collected within 48 to 72âh of hospitalization to analyze endothelial activation markers, including sVCAM-1, von Willebrand Factor (VWF), ADAMTS-13 activity, thrombomodulin (TM), and soluble TNF receptor I (sTNFRI); heparan sulfate (HS) for endothelial glycocalyx degradation; C5b9 deposits on endothelial cells in culture and soluble C5b9 for complement activation; circulating dsDNA for neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) presence, and &#945;2-antiplasmin and PAI-1 as parameters of fibrinolysis. We compared the level of each biomarker in all three COVID-19 groups and healthy donors as controls (nâ=â45). Results in critically ill COVID-19 patients were compared with other intensive care unit (ICU) patients with septic shock (SS, nâ=â14), sepsis (S, nâ=â7), and noninfectious systemic inflammatory response syndrome (NI-SIRS, nâ=â7). RESULTS: All analyzed biomarkers were increased in COVID-19 patients versus controls (Pâ<â0.001), except for ADAMTS-13 activity that was normal in both groups. The increased expression of sVCAM-1, VWF, sTNFRI, and HS was related to COVID-19 disease severity (Pâ<â0.05). Several differences in these parameters were found between ICU groups: SS patients showed significantly higher levels of VWF, TM, sTNFRI, and NETS compared with critical COVID-19 patients and ADAMTS-13 activity was significantly lover in SS, S, and NI-SIRS versus critical COVID-19 (Pâ<â0.001). Furthermore, &#945;2-antiplasmin activity was higher in critical COVID-19 versus NI-SIRS (Pâ<â0.01) and SS (Pâ<â0.001), whereas PAI-1 levels were significantly lower in COVID-19 patients compared with NI-SIRS, S, and SS patients (Pâ<â0.01). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 patients present with increased circulating endothelial stress products, complement activation, and fibrinolytic dysregulation, associated with disease severity. COVID-19 endotheliopathy differs from SS, in which endothelial damage is also a critical feature of pathobiology. These biomarkers could help to stratify the severity of COVID-19 disease and may also provide information to guide specific therapeutic strategies to mitigate endotheliopathy progression.","Fernández, Sara; Moreno-Castaño, Ana B; Palomo, Marta; Martinez-Sanchez, Julia; Torramadé-Moix, Sergi; Téllez, Adrián; Ventosa, Helena; Seguí, Ferran; Escolar, Ginés; Carreras, Enric; Nicolás, Josep M; Richardson, Edward; García-Bernal, David; Carlo-Stella, Carmelo; Moraleda, José M; Richardson, Paul G; Díaz-Ricart, Maribel; Castro, Pedro",Shock (Augusta Ga.),,141

Recent global events including the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic means that human encounter with viruses is increased. Cancer development in individuals with viral infection can take many years after infection, demonstrating that the involvement of viruses in cancer development is a long and complex process. This complexity emanates from individual genetic heterogeneity and the many steps involved in cancer development owing to viruses. The process of tumorigenesis is driven by the complex interaction between several viral factors and host factors leading to the creation of a tumor microenvironment (TME) that is ideal and promotes tumor formation. Viruses associated with human cancers ensure their survival and proliferation through activation of several cellular processes including inflammation, migration, and invasion, resistance to apoptosis and growth suppressors. In addition, most human oncoviruses evade immune detection and can activate signaling cascades including the PI3K-Akt-mTOR, Notch and Wnt pathways associated with enhanced proliferation and angiogenesis. This expert review examines and synthesizes the multiple biological factors related to oncoviruses, and the signaling cascades activated by these viruses contributing to viral oncogenesis. In particular, I examine and review the Epstein-Barr virus, human papillomaviruses, and Kaposi's sarcoma herpes virus in a context of cancer pathogenesis. I conclude with a future outlook on therapeutic targeting of the viruses and their associated oncogenic pathways within the TME.

We performed a cross-sectional study of 351 Massachusetts cities and towns from January 1 to May 6, 2020, and found that a 10-percentage-point increase in the Black non-Latino population was associated with an increase of 312.3 COVID-19 cases per 100,000 population, whereas a 10-percentage-point increase in the Latino population was associated with an increase of 258.2 cases per 100,000. Independent predictors of higher COVID-19 rates included the proportion of foreign-born noncitizens living in a community, mean household size, and share of food service workers. After adjustment for these variables, the association between the Latino population and COVID-19 rates was attenuated. In contrast, the association between the Black population and COVID-19 rates persisted but may be explained by other systemic inequities.

Diagnosis and management can be challenging given the infrequency of this clinical presentation. We present a case of Neisseria meningitides associated purpura fulminans that initially presented as acute hypoxic respiratory failure suspected to be secondary to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). A 55-year-old male with past medical history of hypertension presented to the emergency room after being tested for COVID-19 with fever, cough, and generalized weakness. At time of initial presentation, the patient was tachycardic and mildly febrile. Initial laboratory studies noted white blood cell count 2.5, platelets 127, lactate 2.3, potassium 3.3, and total bilirubin 1.7. Initial electrocardiogram and chest x-ray were unremarkable. Given suspicion for COVID-19, he was started on intravenous fluids, antibiotics, and admitted for further monitoring. Four hours later, he became persistently febrile, tachypneic, and hypoxic. Upon transfer to the Intensive Care Unit, a CTA pulmonary was obtained which showed dependent lung densities consistent with atelectasis. Repeat laboratory studies noted lactate 8.7, fibrinogen 131, ferritin 936, d-dimer &gt; 4, procalcitonin &gt; 40, and an upward trend in PT/INR. Ultimately, the patient was intubated for respiratory muscle fatigue. Post-intubation, he remained hypotensive and vasopressors were initiated. Later that afternoon, his COVID-19 test resulted as negative. During evening rounds, the patient developed significant bleeding from his oropharynx. Repeat investigation revealed platelet count 20, fibrinogen &lt; 94, PT 26.8, and INR 2.37. He was transfused with fresh frozen plasma and cryoprecipitate. Admission blood cultures then grew gram-negative rods which speciated Neisseria meningitidis bacteria. Over the next few days, he developed significant skin necrosis. Plastic surgery was consulted and recommended transfer to a burn center. At the outside facility, given the extent of necrosis, the decision was made to pursue amputation. Subsequently, the patient underwent bilateral guillotine disarticulation of the wrists and bilateral below the knee amputations. In patients with DIC, sepsis, and an evolving skin rash, clinicians should have a high index of suspicion for purpura fulminans. Although initial presentations begin with small areas of petechiae or purpura, the onset of skin necrosis is swift. Delays in initiation of broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy place patients at an increased risk of mortality and limb loss. In this case, early diagnosis proved challenging given the patient's non-specific presenting symptoms in the absence of clinical evidence of meningitis.","Salcin, S.; Raybon-Rojas, E.; McDonald, A.",American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,,141

Here we review experimental research assessing the impact of the stress-related hormone cortisol on long-term memory retrieval. METHOD: A comprehensive literature search was conducted on PubMed, Web of Science and PsycNet databases with the following terms: ""stress,"" ""long-term memory,"" and ""retrieval."" Studies were included in the review if they tested samples of healthy human participants, with at least one control group, and with the onset of the stress intervention occurring after the encoding phase and shortly (up to one hour) before the final memory test. RESULTS: Thirteen studies were included in the qualitative synthesis (N = 962) and were classified according to the time elapsed between stress induction and memory retrieval (stress-retrieval delay), the stress-inducing protocol (stressor), the time of day in which stress induction took place, sex, and age of participants. Most studies induced stress with the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) between 15 and 25 minutes before the final memory (mostly recall) test and showed significant increases in cortisol levels and memory impairment. DISCUSSION: The reviewed studies indicate that stress does impair retrieval, particularly when induced with the TSST, in the afternoon, up to 45 minutes before the onset of the final memory test, in healthy young men. These results may inform future research on the impact of stress-induced cortisol surges on memory retrieval.","Klier, Cadu; Buratto, Luciano Grüdtner",Trends Psychiatry Psychother,,141

Moreover, some patients still assume VKAs refusing to change their therapy when direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are properly indicated. The COVID-19 pandemic has completely changed our lives, nullifying inter-personal relationships to avoid contagion, making difficult the VKAs monitoring. We describe the re-organization of our thrombosis centre (TC) as an example on how to face the emergency due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the first phase, to avoid overcrowding at the TC, we planned to increase the interval time between INRs checks and to encourage blood sampling at home, especially for elderly patients. Moreover, precise scheduled blood sampling was also organized while telephone and email counselling were guaranteed by two doctors of the TC. In the second phase, to reduce the number of patients who daily attended our TC a switch from VKAs to DOACs was carried out, if no contraindications were identified. In the third phase, to protect patients, healthcare staff and hospital from COVID-19 widespread, telemedicine was strengthened. We tried to extend self-testing at home by means of portable coagulometers to as more patients as possible. To avoid patients staying or coming back to the TC an ad hoc web platform for sending the therapeutic dose adjustment and the next scheduled appointment was developed. The TC re-organization allowed us to monitor anticoagulated patients respecting personal isolation and security measures to avoid possible COVID-19 contagion.","Barcellona, Doris; Marongiu, Francesco",Intern Emerg Med,,141
213339,Disjunctive Globalization in the Era of the Great Unsettling,2020,"IntroductionCoronaviruses are one of the common viruses that can cause diseases for humans and animals. In December 2019, a new coronavirus (Novel Coronavirus) was detected as the cause of pneumonia and then respiratory failure. One of the modalities that have been used for treatment is prone positioning. The purpose of this meta-analysis was to investigate the efficacy of awake early prone positioning on COVID-19 patients with respiratory failure.Methods We performed a comprehensive search in the literature for studies that evaluated prone positioning in COVID-19. We searched the databases of PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, World Health Organization COVID-19 Database, LitCOVID, and Web of Science Core Collection databases from January 1, 2020, until November 30, 2020. The search was not limited by language, study design, or country of origin. Two researchers (MA and SG) independently selected the studies;discrepancies were resolved by a third researcher (OS). We considered randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, case-control studies, and case series. We excluded animal studies, case reports, reviews, editorials, and letters to editors. We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The random-effects model was used to calculate the odds ratios (OR), and confidence intervals (CI). Our main outcomes were intubation rate and mortality rate for patients who were admitted to the hospital with hypoxic respiratory failure. Results We included 3 studies in our meta-analysis with a total of 290 patients. There was no significant difference between prone positioned awake patients compared to non-prone positioned awake patients regarding intubation rate OR 1.48 ( 95% CI: 0.751-2.927, P-value: 0.257 ) (Figure 1) and mortality rate OR 0.54 ( 95% CI: 0.219-1.326, Pvalue: 0.179) (Figure 2). Conclusion Early awake prone positioning does not have a significant impact on nonintubated COVID-19 patients with respiratory failure according to our meta-analysis. More randomized controlled trials should be done to evaluate the efficacy.","Awad, M.

216153,Incremental transformation of spatial intelligence from smart systems to sensorial infrastructures,2020,"Emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern that overcome natural and vaccine-induced immunity threaten to exacerbate the COVID-19 pandemic. Increasing evidence suggests that neutralizing antibody (NAb) responses are a primary mechanism of protection against infection. However, little is known about the extent and mechanisms by which natural immunity acquired during the early COVID-19 pandemic confers cross-neutralization of emerging variants. In this study, we investigated cross-neutralization of the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 SARS-CoV-2 variants in a well-characterized cohort of early pandemic convalescent subjects. We observed modestly decreased cross-neutralization of B.1.1.7 but a substantial 4.8-fold reduction in cross-neutralization of B.1.351. Correlates of cross-neutralization included receptor binding domain (RBD) and N-terminal domain (NTD) binding antibodies, homologous NAb titers, and membrane-directed T cell responses. These data shed light on the cross-neutralization of emerging variants by early pandemic convalescent immune responses. IMPORTANCE Widespread immunity to SARS-CoV-2 will be necessary to end the COVID-19 pandemic. NAb responses are a critical component of immunity that can be stimulated by natural infection as well as vaccines. However, SARS-CoV-2 variants are emerging that contain mutations in the spike gene that promote evasion from NAb responses. These variants may therefore delay control of the COVID-19 pandemic. We studied whether NAb responses from early COVID-19 convalescent patients are effective against the two SARS-CoV-2 variants, B.1.1.7 and B.1.351. We observed that the B.1.351 variant demonstrates significantly reduced susceptibility to early pandemic NAb responses. We additionally characterized virological, immunological, and clinical features that correlate with cross-neutralization. These studies increase our understanding of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.","Vidal, Samuel J; Collier, Ai-Ris Y; Yu, Jingyou; McMahan, Katherine; Tostanoski, Lisa H; Ventura, John D; Aid, Malika; Peter, Lauren; Jacob-Dolan, Catherine; Anioke, Tochi; Chang, Aiquan; Wan, Huahua; Aguayo, Ricardo; Ngo, Debby; Gerszten, Robert E; Seaman, Michael S; Barouch, Dan H",J Virol,,141

Methods: Retrospective data from 37 hospitals within a large multi-hospital stroke registry was analyzed. All patients with a confirmed discharge diagnosis of stroke or TIA during the pandemic (March and April 2020) were compared to cohorts during the same periods in 2018 and 2019. Analyzed factors included demographics, stroke mechanism, admission NIHSS, reperfusion therapy rates (IV TPA and EVT), reperfusion performance metrics (door-to-CT, door-to-needle, door-topuncture, door-to-first pass), TICI score, discharge and 90-day mRS, discharge disposition, and length of stay. Analyses were conducted using ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis, or Person's Chi-square test, as appropriate, adjusting for multiple comparisons. Results: Among the 7,201 analyzed patients, 2,378 (33.0%) were admitted in 2018, 2,613 (36.3%) in 2019 and 2,210 (30.7%) in 2020. Fewer patients were hospitalized with TIA during the pandemic compared to 2018 and 2019 (23.6% vs 36.8% vs 39.6%, p&lt;.001). More patients arrived via EMS (52.2% vs 45.7% vs 45.4 %) and fewer via private car (29.8% vs 37.8% vs 38.7%) (p&lt;.001) during the pandemic. Median door-to-CT (in minutes) (26 vs 35 vs 33, p&lt;.001) time was significantly shorter during the pandemic. Additionally, a greater percentage of patients were treated with EVT during the pandemic (7.5 vs 5.7 vs 5.4, p=.005). Shorter arrival-to-first pass times (in minutes) occurred in 2020 compared to previous years (103 vs 119 vs 115, p=0.091) but this difference did not reach statistical significance. Fewer patients were discharged to a skilled nursing facility during the pandemic (12.7%) compared to 2018 and 2019 (15.1% and 15.2%, p=.012). There were no other significant differences in stroke admission volumes, treatment trends, or outcomes between the pandemic and pre-pandemic periods. Conclusion: Fewer walk-in strokes and TIAs were hospitalized during the pandemic while an increased rate of thrombectomy procedures occurred compared to the pre-pandemic era.

Methods: We established a retrospective cohort of patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 (&#8805; 18 years old) from two tertiary hospitals: the People's hospital of Wuhan University and Leishenshan Hospital between February 16, 2020, and April 14, 2020. The diagnosis of the cases was confirmed according to the WHO interim guidance. The data of consecutive severely and critically ill patients with COVID-19 admitted to these hospitals were analyzed. A total of 566 patients from the People's Hospital of Wuhan University were included in the training cohort and 436 patients from Leishenshan Hospital were included in the validation cohort. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and multivariable logistic regression were used to select the variables and build the mortality risk prediction model. Results: The prediction model was resented as a nomograph and developed based on identified predictors, including age, chronic lung disease, C-reactive protein (CRP), D-dimer levels, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), creatine, and total bilirubin. In the training cohort, the model displayed good discrimination with an AUC of 0.912 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.884-0.940] and good calibration (intercept = 0; slope = 1). In the validation cohort, the model had an AUC of 0.922 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.891-0.953] and a good calibration (intercept = 0.056; slope = 1.161). The decision curve analysis (DCA) demonstrated that the nomogram was clinically useful. Conclusion: A risk score for severely and critically ill COVID-19 patients' mortality was developed and externally validated. This model can help clinicians to identify individual patients at a high mortality risk.","Chen, Bo; Gu, Hongqiu; Liu, Yi; Zhang, Guqin; Yang, Hang; Hu, Huifang; Lu, Chenyang; Li, Yang; Wang, Liyi; Zhao, Yi; Pan, Huaqin",,,141

At present, there is no highly effective medicine for the prevention and treatment of 2019-nCoV. Western medicine for COVID-19 is mainly based on symptomatic support therapy. Chinese herbal medicine has been used to prevent infectious diseases for thousands of years in China. Western medicine routine treatment combined with Chinese herbal medicine is an alternative clinical option but lacks evidence-based medical evidence. The systematic review protocol aims to formulate a research plan that can evaluate the efficacy and safety of western medicine routine treatment combined with Chinese herbal medicine for COVID-19. METHODS: We will search the following eight databases: Cochrane Library, PubMed, Embase, Medline, CNKI, Wanfang, VIP, and CBM. The search time is up to the end of July 2020. Two authors will independently complete literature screening, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment. In case of disagreement, the third author will assist in the judgment. The primary outcome will be the clinical cure rate. The secondary outcome will be accounting symptoms, fever time, time of virus nucleic acid turning negative, check the condition by drawing blood, pneumonia absorption rate, patient hospitalization time, severe conversion rate and case fatality rate, adverse reactions, and adverse events. Revman 5.3 will be used for systematic reviews and meta-analysis. The report of the protocol will follow the PRISMA-P statement, and the report of the systematic review and meta-analysis will follow the PRISMA statement. RESULTS: We will provide evidence-based medical evidence of the efficacy and safety of western medicine routine treatment combined with Chinese herbal medicine for COVID-19. The findings will be published in peer-reviewed journals.

225145,"Commentary to the Royal Decree Law 23/2020 of June 23, Approving Measures in the Field of Energy and in Other Areas for Economic Reactivation",2020,"N6 methyladenosine (m6A), the methylation of the adenosine base at the nitrogen-6 position, is the most common epitranscriptomic modification of mRNA that affects a wide variety of biological functions. We have previously reported that hepatitis B viral RNAs are m6A modified, displaying a dual functional role in the viral life cycle. Here, we show that cellular m6A machinery regulates host innate immunity against hepatitis B and C viral (HBV/HCV) infections by inducing m6A modification of viral transcripts. The depletion of the m6A writer enzymes (METTL3 and METTL14) leads to an increase in viral RNA recognition by retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I), thereby stimulating type-I interferon production. This is reversed in cells, in which m6A METTL3 and METTL14 are overexpressed. The m6A modification of viral RNAs renders RIG-I signaling less effective, and while single nucleotide mutation of m6A consensus motif of viral RNAs, enhances RIG-I sensing activity. Importantly, m6A reader proteins (YTHDF2 and YTHDF3) inhibit RIG-I transduced signaling activated by viral RNAs by occupying m6A modified RNAs and inhibiting RIG-I recognition. Collectively, our results provide new insights into the mechanism of immune evasion via m6A modification of viral RNAs.","Kim, Geon-Woo; Imam, Hasan; Khan, Mohsin; Siddiqui, Aleem",J. biol. chem,,141

We describe processes, curricular innovations, and lessons learned. Small groups were converted into independent learning modules and lectures were given live via videoconferencing technology. We started with a simplified approach and then built technological capabilities over time. Current events were incorporated into curriculum and assessment. Our course ran from 16 March-3 April 2020 for the 155-person first-year class. Student attendance for optional, synchronous remote sessions was higher than in-person attendance in previous years. Completion rates for assignments were high but with minimal student collaboration. Faculty office hours were underutilized. Focus group and formal evaluations were largely positive, with numerical ratings for quality of the course and faculty teaching higher than the 2 years prior. Student engagement with social justice topics in aremote format was successful through modifications to small groups and lecture structure. Students, faculty, and administrative staff appreciated the consistency of session format throughout the course. Students exam performance was similar to prior years. Attention should be paid to what can be learned via self-study as opposed to small group learning. Better methods of soliciting real-time student feedback, and encouraging engagement with each other and with faculty in aremote environment are needed.","Garg, Megha; Eniasivam, Archna; Satterfield, Jason; Norton, Betsy; Austin, Elizabeth; Dohan, Daniel",Med Educ Online,,141

227150,Serum tests and progressive deconfinement/ Tests sériques et déconfinement progressif,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 prevention and control constantly affects lives worldwide. In this paper, household medical products were analyzed using fuzzy logic. Considering the household anti-epidemic status, economic and environmental benefits, the adaptable design method of anti-epidemic products in the vestibule was proposed. The measure of adaptable design method still have shortcomings. Therefore, an improved method that is based on fuzzy logic programming is required. METHOD: Firstly, common medical product types used in vestibules and household anti-epidemic products were identified and summarized into product sets. Then matching degree matrix was obtained by functional configuration decomposition and matching calculations. Secondly, experts were invited to evaluate the paired comparative probability matrices and linguistic variables, and the evaluation data were converted by trapezoidal membership functions, fuzzy numbers and the defuzzification method to obtain the usage probability values (PR) for product functions. Finally, the matching degree value (P) and the product function (PF) were calculated by adaptability measure formula, and product function, the adaptability factor and the adaptability (A) were obtained. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Our results show that the degree of adaptability of each product function in the product set from PF1 to PF10can be evaluated. Based on the principles of sorting of values from high to low, the top five PF (n = 10) for P value is PF10, PF5, PF6, PF8 and PF1; The top five PF for P value is PF2, PF1, PF3, PF7 and PF8; The top five PF for A value is PF2(0.242), PF1(0.232), PF5(0.225), PF8(0.222) and PF3(0.221). These values allow us to summarize and draw visual charts according to the above data sorting mode. The higher the value of the product function, the more it can be prioritized for design development with functional cost savings, simplification or clustering. CONCLUSION: This study proposes an adaptable design method based on fuzzy logic programming. The data results in this study can guide the development and programming of the vestibule anti-epidemic products. The higher adaptability value of a product function indicates that it is more capable of being simplified, clustered, and adapting to changes in the product set.","Fu, You-Lei; Liang, Kuei-Chia",Comput Methods Programs Biomed,,141

METHODS: Retrospective, open-label, real-world, uncontrolled, single-arm case series conducted in 2 tertiary hospitals in NSW, Australia and 1 tertiary hospital in Victoria, Australia. Five adult male patients aged between 46 and 74 years with type 1 respiratory failure due to COVID-19 pneumonia requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission and biochemical evidence of systemic hyperinflammation (C-reactive protein greater than 100 mg/L; ferritin greater than 700 µg/L) were administered variable-dose tocilizumab. RESULTS: At between 13 and 26 days follow-up, all patients are alive and have been discharged from ICU. Two patients have been discharged home. Two patients avoided endotracheal intubation. Oxygen therapy has been ceased in three patients. Four adverse events potentially associated with tocilizumab therapy occurred in three patients: ventilator-associated pneumonia, bacteremia associated with central venous catheterization, myositis and hepatitis. All patients received broad-spectrum antibiotics, 4 received corticosteroids and 2 received both lopinavir/ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine. The time from first tocilizumab administration to improvement in ventilation, defined as a 25% reduction in fraction of inspired oxygen required to maintain peripheral oxygen saturation greater than 92%, ranged from 7 hours to 4.6 days.

BACKGROUND: Individuals with IBS and comorbid anxiety and/or depression report increased symptoms and decreased quality of life compared with individuals with IBS alone. The current COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to further influence symptoms among individuals with IBS and comorbid anxiety and/or depression. STUDY: Individuals who met the Rome-IV IBS criteria and reported mild to severe anxiety and/or depression were included. Participants completed an online survey with questions about anxiety, depression, impact of COVID on activities and symptoms, and demographics. RESULTS: Fifty-five individuals participated in the study. The COVID-19 pandemic most commonly influenced their ability to spend time with friends and family, shop for certain types of food, and access health care. Participants also reported increased stress (92%), anxiety (81%), and depressive symptoms (67%). Finally, around half the sample reported increases in abdominal pain (48%), diarrhea (45%), or constipation (44%).

METHODS: This prospective, observational study of patients with COVID-19 infection was conducted from 6 June to 26 November 2020 in different wards of a tertiary hospital. MR-proANP, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and high-sensitive cardiac troponin I levels on admission were collected and tested for their association with disease severity and 28-day mortality. RESULTS: A total of 213 eligible patients with COVID-19 were included in the final analyses of whom 13.2% (n = 28) died within 28 days. Median levels of MR-proANP at admission were significantly higher in nonsurvivors (307 pmol/L IQR, [161 - 532] vs 75 pmol/L [IQR, 43 - 153], P < .001) compared to survivors and increased with disease severity and level of hypoxaemia. The area under the ROC curve for MR-proANP predicting 28-day mortality was 0.832 (95% CI 0.753 - 0.912, P < .001). An optimal cut-off point of 160 pmol/L yielded a sensitivity of 82.1% and a specificity of 76.2%. MR-proANP was a significant predictor of 28-day mortality independent of clinical confounders, comorbidities and established prognostic markers of COVID-19 (HR 2.77, 95% CI 1.21 - 6.37; P = .016), while NT-proBNP failed to independently predict 28-day mortality and had a numerically lower AUC compared to MR-proANP. CONCLUSION: Higher levels of MR-proANP at admission are associated with disease severity of COVID-19 and act as a powerful and independent prognostic marker of 28-day mortality.","Kaufmann, Christoph C; Ahmed, Amro; Kassem, Mona; Freynhofer, Matthias K; Jäger, Bernhard; Aicher, Gabriele; Equiluz-Bruck, Susanne; Spiel, Alexander O; Funk, Georg-Christian; Gschwantler, Michael; Fasching, Peter; Wojta, Johann; Huber, Kurt",Eur J Clin Invest,,141

This system interferes minimally with the activity studied, maintaining a reduced cost of manufacture and use. The system allows the study of the movements made by the subject in the work environment by determining the origin of the Musculoskeletal Disorder (MSD) from the movements of the elbow and wrist, collecting data on the position and accelerations of the arm, forearm and hand, and taking into account the risk factors established for suffering from an MSD: high repetition of movements, the use of a high force in a repetitive manner, or the adoption of forced positions.

Two groups of mini RTCs with different conformations of nsp13-1 are identified. In both of them, nsp13-1 stabilizes overall architecture of the mini RTC by contacting with nsp13-2, which anchors the 5'-extension of RNA template, as well as interacting with nsp7-nsp8-nsp12-RNA. Orientation shifts of nsp13-1 results in its variable interactions with other components in two forms of mini RTC. The mutations on nsp13-1:nsp12 and nsp13-1:nsp13-2 interfaces prohibit the enhancement of helicase activity achieved by mini RTCs. These results provide an insight into how helicase couples with polymerase to facilitate its function in virus replication and transcription.","Yan, Liming; Zhang, Ying; Ge, Ji; Zheng, Litao; Gao, Yan; Wang, Tao; Jia, Zhihui; Wang, Haofeng; Huang, Yucen; Li, Mingyu; Wang, Quan; Rao, Zihe; Lou, Zhiyong",Nat Commun,,141

Together, these two phenomena have brought about tremendous advances in scientific discovery but have also raised two serious concerns, one relatively new and one quite familiar. The complexity of modern data analyses raises questions about the reproducibility of the analyses, meaning the ability of independent analysts to re-create the results claimed by the original authors using the original data and analysis techniques. While seemingly a straightforward concept, reproducibility of analyses is typically thwarted by the lack of availability of the data and computer code that were used in the analyses. A much more general concern is the replicability of scientific findings, which concerns the frequency with which scientific claims are confirmed by completely independent investigations. While the concepts of reproduciblity and replicability are related, it is worth noting that they are focused on quite different goals and address different aspects of scientific progress. In this review, we will discuss the origins of reproducible research, characterize the current status of reproduciblity in public health research, and connect reproduciblity to current concerns about replicability of scientific findings. Finally, we describe a path forward for improving both the reproducibility and replicability of public health research in the future.","Peng, Roger D.; Hicks, Stephanie C.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.12210v1.pdf,141

These online courses were designed using published methodologies and held to a high level of rigor of a Masters-level curriculum. Adapting pre-existing online course material enabled us to more rapidly adapt to the COVID-19 shutdown of in-person education. We adapted content to meet the majority of lab-based learning objectives rather than generating self-recorded lecture material and allowing us to focus faculty time on addressing student needs.

230250,Association Between ABO and Rh Blood Groups and SARS-CoV-2 Infection or Severe COVID-19 Illness : A Population-Based Cohort Study,2020,"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 outbreak highly impacted the acute ischemic stroke care management. The primary end point of the study was to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak and the following lockdown measures on our hub-and-spoke network; the secondary end point was to evaluate if the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak was different in hub-and-spoke centers. METHODS: This was a retrospective multicenter observational study conducted at the Stroke Units of Policlinico Gemelli, Ospedale San Filippo Neri, Ospedale di Belcolle, and Ospedale San Camillo de Lellis. We collected clinical reports of all consecutive patients admitted with diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) during the phase 1 of the lockdown period (11 March 2020-4 May 2020). As controls, we used all consecutive patients admitted for acute ischemic stroke or TIA in the same period of the previous year. RESULTS: A total of 156 and 142 clinical reports were collected in 2019 and 2020, respectively. During the COVID-19 outbreak, we observed a reduction of number of thrombolysis, a reduction of the length of hospitalization, and an increase of pneumonia. Regarding performance indicators, we observed an increase in onset-to-door time and in door-to-groin time. We did not observe any statistically significant interaction between year (2019 vs 2020) and facility of admission (hub vs spoke) on all variables analyzed. DISCUSSION: Our observational study, involving hub-and-spoke stroke network of a wide regional area, indicates that the COVID-19 outbreak impacted on the acute stroke management. This impact was equally observed in hub as well as in spoke centers.","Brunetti, Valerio; Broccolini, Aldobrando; Caliandro, Pietro; Di Iorio, Riccardo; Monforte, Mauro; Morosetti, Roberta; Piano, Carla; Pilato, Fabio; Bellavia, Simone; Marotta, Jessica; Scala, Irene; Pedicelli, Alessandro; Pennisi, Mariano Alberto; Caricato, Anselmo; Roberti, Cinzia; Altavista, Maria Concetta; Valenza, Alessandro; Distefano, Marisa; Cecconi, Emanuela; Fanella, Martina; Roncacci, Sabina; Tasillo, Miriam; Calabresi, Paolo; Frisullo, Giovanni; Marca, Giacomo Della",Neurol Sci,,141

In patients with severe COVID-19, we assessed the association between chronic ACEI/ARB use and the occurrence of kidney, lung, heart, and liver dysfunctions and the severity of the inflammatory reaction as evaluated by biomarkers kinetics, and their association with disease outcomes. METHODS: We performed a retrospective longitudinal cohort study on consecutive patients with newly diagnosed severe COVID-19. Independent predictors were assessed through receiver operating characteristic analysis, time-series analysis, logistic regression analysis, and multilevel modeling for repeated measures. RESULTS: On the 149 patients included in the study 30% (44/149) were treated with ACEI/ARB. ACEI/ARB use was independently associated with the following biochemical variations: phosphorus >40 mg/L (odds ratio [OR], 3.35, 95% CI, 1.83-6.14), creatinine >10.1 mg/L (OR, 3.22, 2.28-4.54), and urea nitrogen (UN) >0.52 g/L (OR, 2.65, 1.89-3.73). ACEI/ARB use was independently associated with acute kidney injury, AKI stage &#8805;1 (OR, 3.28, 2.17-4.94). The daily dose of ACEI/ARB was independently associated with altered kidney markers with an increased risk of +25 to +31% per each 10 mg increment of lisinopril-dose equivalent. In multivariable multilevel modeling, UN >0.52 g/L was independently associated with the risk of acute respiratory failure (OR, 3.54, 1.05-11.96). CONCLUSIONS: Patients chronically treated with ACEI/ARB who have severe COVID-19 are at increased risk of acute kidney injury. In these patients, the increase in UN associated with ACEI/ARB use could predict the development of acute respiratory failure.","Oussalah, Abderrahim; Gleye, Stanislas; Clerc Urmes, Isabelle; Laugel, Elodie; Callet, Jonas; Barbé, Françoise; Orlowski, Sophie; Malaplate, Catherine; Aimone-Gastin, Isabelle; Caillierez, Beatrice Maatem; Merten, Marc; Jeannesson, Elise; Kormann, Raphaël; Olivier, Jean-Luc; Rodriguez-Guéant, Rosa-Maria; Namour, Farès; Bevilacqua, Sybille; Losser, Marie-Reine; Levy, Bruno; Kimmoun, Antoine; Gibot, Sébastien; Thilly, Nathalie; Frimat, Luc; Schvoerer, Evelyne; Guéant, Jean-Louis",Clin. infect. dis,,141

232066,Deep Learning Applications to Combat Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic,2020,"The COVID 19 pandemic led to lockdown and restrictions on anthropogenic activities not only in India but all over the world. This provided an opportunity to study positive effects on environment and subsequent impact on terrestrial ecosystems such as urban, peri-urban, forest and agriculture. A variety of studies presented so far mainly include improved air quality index, water quality, reduced pollutants etc. The present study focused on few novel parameters from both polar and geostationary satellites that are not studied in context to India, and also attempts deriving/quantifying benefits rather than merely indicating qualitative improvements. Due to lack of anthropogenic activities during complete lockdown-1 (21 days from 25 March 2020) in India nighttime cooling of land surface temperature (LST) of the order of 2 to 6 K was observed. Amongst 10 major cities, Bhopal showed highest nighttime cooling. The cooling effect in LST was evident in 80% of industrial units distinctly indicating cooling trend. Vegetation fires were analyzed in 10 fire-prone states of India. Compared to past fouryear average number of occurrences, only 45% fire occurrences occurred during lockdown, indicating strong effect of lockdown. The study also revealed that, there is increase in gross primary production in forest ecosystem to the tune of maximum 38%, during this period. Though delay in rabi crop harvest date by 1 to 2 weeks in majority of north Indian states was observed rise in rabi crop productivity of the order of maximum 34% was observed which is attributed to favorable environmental conditions for net carbon uptake. About 18% reduction in volumetric agricultural water demand was estimated in Indo-Gangetic region, parts of Gujarat and Rajasthan. Apart from controlling the spread of the disease, the lockdown restrictions were thus also able to show positive effects on the environment and ecosystem which might influence to rethink on strategies for sustainable development.","Lele, Nikhil; Nigam, Rahul; Bhattacharya, Bimal K",Remote Sens Appl,,141

The coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic is taking an enormous toll on public health and stretching medical resources in an unprecedented fashion. Our priorities are rightly focusing on meeting this existential threat. Nonetheless, we wish to call to attention that during major catastrophes the health consequences of chronic diseases, in particular cardiometabolic risk factors (CMRFs), continue unabated. In fact, new and serious problems arise part-and-parcel with the catastrophe and conspire to hamper our already imperfect ability to control CMRFs1,2. Our objective is to raise awareness that we need to anticipate (and not just be reactive to) the possible coming of a second crisis we term ""disastrous CMRFs"". This refers to the worsening of CMRFs and their control rates during and following a major disaster. Health care providers, in particular cardiologists, need to recognize the potential for this serious problem as it could promote a burgeoning of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality if not addressed. The COVID-19 pandemic should also serve as a wake-up call to the antiquated flaws in our healthcare model that collude to undermine the successful management of CMRFs in general. This current crisis can be a catalyst for optimizing practices and creating critical new capacities that will be beneficial moving forward and serve as a bulwark against future crises.","Brook, Robert D; Levy, Phillip; Rajagopalan, Sanjay","Circ., Cardiovasc. qual. outcomes (Online)",,141

Material and Methods: Randomized controlled trials of patients in orthodontic treatment, which required miniscrews for orthodontic intervention reporting the failure rate of miniscrews in the maxilla and mandible were searched in Pubmed database. Two authors independently reviewed all identified titles and abstracts for eligibility. Comparison between failures in maxilla and mandible were estimated using pairwise meta-analysis to calculate the relative risk (RR) of failure and the 95% confidence intervals using a random-effect model. The reports of randomized trials were assessed for bias using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Results: Four studies fulfilled the eligibility criteria. 299 patients with a total of 628 miniscrews installed were included in the analysis. The analysis showed a 0.55 RR (95% CI 0.23­1.29) and I2 = 85%. All studies had an unclear risk of bias regarding to the two following items: allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel. All studies had a low risk of bias with regard to incomplete outcome data and selective reporting. The results did not demonstrate statistical difference between risk of failure of miniscrew between maxilla and mandible. Conclusion: The results of the meta-analysis showed that miniscrews installed in maxilla presents reduced risk of failure. A tendency of higher number of failures in mandible was also demonstrated. However, results should be interpreted with caution because of the very low quality of included studies and the differences among methodologies.

OBJECTIVE: In this descriptive analysis, we analyzed the epidemiological evidence for PHSM impact on COVID-19 transmission in the US compared to that in ten other countries of varying income levels, population sizes, and geographies. METHODS: We compared PHSM implementation timing and stringency against COVID-19 daily case counts in the US to that in Canada, China, Ethiopia, Japan, Kazakhstan, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea, Vietnam, and Zimbabwe from January 1 to November 25, 2020. We descriptively analyzed the impact of border closures, contact tracing, household confinement, mandated face masks, quarantine and isolation, school closures, limited gatherings, and states of emergency on COVID-19 case counts. We also compared the relationship between global socioeconomic indicators and national pandemic trajectories across the 11 countries. PHSM and case count data were derived from various surveillance systems - the Health Intervention Tracking for COVID-19 database, the World Health Organization PHSM database, and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. RESULTS: Implementing a specific package of four PHSM (quarantine and isolation, school closures, household confinement, and limiting social gatherings) early and stringently was observed to coincide with lower cases and transmission duration in Vietnam, Zimbabwe, New Zealand, South Korea, Ethiopia, and Kazakhstan. In contrast, the US implemented few PHSM stringently or early and did not utilize this successful package. Across countries, national income was positively correlated (r=0.624) with cumulative COVID-19 incidence. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that early implementation, consistent execution, adequate duration, and high adherence to PHSMs represent key factors in reducing the spread of COVID-19. While national income may be related to COVID-19 progression, a country's wealth appears less important in controlling the pandemic than taking rapid, centralized, and consistent public health action.","Zweig, Sophia Alison; Zapf, Alexander John; Xu, Hanmeng; Li, Qingfeng; Agarwal, Smisha; Labrique, Alain Bernard; Peters, David H",,,141

Such restrictions and social distancing could particularly affect people who use alcohol or other drugs in recreational settings and give rise to new challenges and additional needs in the field of addiction prevention and care. To monitor changes in substance use and provide services with practical directions for tailored prevention, an anonymous web survey was set up, targeting a convenience sample aged 16 years or older through various social media and other online channels. Between May and October 2020, a total of 6,070 participants completed the survey, mainly adolescents and young adults (16-24 years old). These data were used to explore and describe changing patterns in substance use. Overall results showed declined current use compared to ""pre-corona,"" but mask underlying variation in changing patterns, including discontinued (tobacco 10.4%, alcohol 11.3%, cannabis 16.3%, other drugs 30.4%), decreased (tobacco 23.0%, alcohol 29.1%, cannabis 17.4%, other drugs 20.7%), unchanged (tobacco 30.3%, alcohol 21.2%, cannabis 22.3%, other drugs 17.3%), increased (tobacco 29.6%, alcohol 32.1%, cannabis 32.9%, other drugs 25.3%), and (re)commenced use (tobacco 6.7%, alcohol 6.3%, cannabis 11.1%, other drugs 6.2%). Especially the use of drugs like ecstasy and nitrous oxide was discontinued or decreased due to the lack of social occasions for use. Increased use was associated with coping motives for all substance types. As measures combatting the coronavirus may need to be practiced for some time to come, possibly leading to prolonged changes in substance use with lingering ""post-corona"" consequences, timely and ongoing monitoring of changing patterns of substance use is vital for informing prevention services within this field.","Benschop, A.; van Bakkum, F.; Noijen, J.",Frontiers in Psychiatry,,141
236788,Postdigital Brave New World and Its Educational Implications,2020,"Syrian golden hamsters exhibit features of severe disease after SARS-CoV-2 challenge and are therefore useful models of COVID-19 pathogenesis and prevention with vaccines. Recent studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 infection stimulates type I interferon, myeloid, and inflammatory signatures similar to human disease, and that weight loss can be prevented with vaccines. However, the impact of vaccination on transcriptional programs associated with COVID-19 pathogenesis and protective adaptive immune responses is unknown. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 challenge in hamsters stimulates antiviral, myeloid, and inflammatory programs as well as signatures of complement and thrombosis associated with human COVID-19. Notably, single dose immunization with Ad26.COV2.S, an adenovirus serotype 26 vector (Ad26)-based vaccine expressing a stabilized SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, prevents the upregulation of these pathways such that the gene expression profiles of vaccinated hamsters are comparable to uninfected animals. Finally, we show that Ad26.COV2.S vaccination induces T and B cell signatures that correlate with binding and neutralizing antibody responses. These data provide further insights into the mechanisms of Ad26.COV2.S based protection against severe COVID-19 in hamsters. Author SummaryIn this study, we show that vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S protected SARS-CoV-2 challenged hamsters from developing severe COVID-19 disease by attenuating excessive proinflammatory responses, such as IL-6 and IL-1, macrophages and neutrophils signaling. Ad26 vaccination also prevented the upregulation of pathways associated with thrombosis such coagulation and clotting cascades associated with infection, and the transcriptomic profiles of vaccinated animals were largely comparable to control uninfected hamsters. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 challenged unvaccinated hamsters showed significant increase of these proinflammatory and prothrombotic pathways and significant weight loss compared to vaccinated hamsters.","Aid, Malika; Vidal, Samuel; Piedra-Mora, Cesar; Ducat, Sarah; Chan, Chi; Bondoc, Stephen; Colarusse, Alessandro; Starke, Carly; Nekorchuk, Michael; Busman-Sahay, Kathleen; Estes, Jacob; Martinot, Amanda; Barouch, Dan H",,,141

Thus, individuals who naturally contracted SARS-CoV-2 are expected to develop a more rapid and sustained response to COVID-19 vaccines than naïve individuals. In this study, we analyzed the dynamics of the antibody response to the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine in six healthcare workers who contracted SARS-CoV-2 in March 2020, in comparison to nine control subjects without a previous infection. The vaccine was well tolerated by both groups, with no significant difference in the frequency of vaccine-associated side effects, with the exception of local pain, which was more common in previously infected subjects. Overall, the titers of neutralizing antibodies were markedly higher in response to the vaccine than after natural infection. In all subjects with pre-existing immunity, a rapid increase in anti-spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) IgG antibodies and neutralizing antibody titers was observed one week after the first dose, which seemed to act as a booster. Notably, in previously infected individuals, neutralizing antibody titers 7 days after the first vaccine dose were not significantly different from those observed in naïve subjects 7 days after the second vaccine dose. These results suggest that, in previously infected people, a single dose of the vaccine might be sufficient to induce an effective response.","Gobbi, Federico; Buonfrate, Dora; Moro, Lucia; Rodari, Paola; Piubelli, Chiara; Caldrer, Sara; Riccetti, Silvia; Sinigaglia, Alessandro; Barzon, Luisa",Viruses,,141

Telemedicine refers to remote or non-face-to-face medical attention, a new method of administering medical care by accredited professionals, which optimises resources and increases their scope. One drawback for child teleneurology is that our diagnoses require direct observation of the child and carrying out an examination as though playing a game. Mainly in the youngest stages, a new patient evaluated by telemedicine can be more difficult to diagnose and manage, and therefore some neuropaediatricians have chosen to carry out only follow-up visits, medication management and outcome reviews. Telemedicine, however, also has many benefits, such as the possibility of giving rapid advice, coordination among professionals and reaching the patient where and when it is difficult for classical medicine to do so. The aim of this article is to review the possible indications of telemedicine in child neurology, starting out from the fact that we should never delay the diagnosis of something that can be treated, both at the present time and in an eventual situation of resurgence of the pandemic. The advance of telemedicine will depend on the implementation of technology, on solving legal and security/privacy issues, on its clinical outcomes and on the extent to which patients demand and accept these virtual visits.","García-Pérez, A",Rev Neurol,,141

A major cause of morbidity and mortality due to COVID-19 has been the worsening hypoxia that, if untreated, can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and respiratory failure. Past work has found that intubated patients with ARDS experience physiological benefits to the prone position, because it promotes better matching of pulmonary perfusion to ventilation, improved secretion clearance, and recruitment of dependent areas of the lungs. We created a systemwide multi-institutional (New York-Presbyterian Hospital enterprise) protocol for placing awake, nonintubated, emergency department patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 in the prone position.

This study aimed to identify potential risk factors for mortality in older patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on admission, which may help identify those with poor prognosis at an early stage. DESIGN: Retrospective case-control. SETTING: Fever ward of Sino-French New City Branch of Tongji Hospital, Wuhan, China. PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged 60 years or older with COVID-19 (n = 244) were included, of whom 123 were discharged and 121 died in hospital. MEASUREMENTS: Data retrieved from electronic medical records regarding symptoms, signs, and laboratory findings on admission, and final outcomes of all older patients with COVID-19, were retrospectively reviewed. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to explore risk factors for death. RESULTS: Univariate analysis revealed that several clinical characteristics and laboratory variables were significantly different (ie, P < .05) between discharged and deceased patients. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that lymphocyte (LYM) count (odds ratio [OR] = 0.009; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.001-0.138; P = .001) and older age (OR = 1.122; 95% CI = 1.007-1.249; P = .037) were independently associated with hospital mortality. White blood cell count was also an important risk factor (P = .052). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve in the logistic regression model was 0.913. Risk factors for in-hospital death were similar between older men and women. CONCLUSION: Older age and lower LYM count on admission were associated with death in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Stringent monitoring and early intervention are needed to reduce mortality in these patients.

243568,Health care misinformation: An artificial intelligence challenge for low-resource languages,2020,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is an emerging public health problem in modern times and the current COVID-19 pandemic has further exaggerated this problem. Due to bacterial co-infection in COVID-19 cases, an irrational consumption of antibiotics has occurred during the pandemic. This study aimed to observe the COVID-19 patients hospitalized from 1 March 2019 to 31 December 2020 and to evaluate the AMR pattern of bacterial agents isolated. This was a single-center study comprising 494 bacterial isolates (blood and urine) that were obtained from patients with SARS-CoV-2 admitted to the ICU and investigated in the Department of Microbiology of a tertiary care hospital in Delhi, India. Out of the total bacterial isolates, 55.46% were gram negative and 44.53% were gram positive pathogens. Of the blood samples processed, the most common isolates were CoNS (Coagulase Negative Staphylococcus) and Staphylococcus aureus. Amongst the urinary isolates, most common pathogens were Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. A total of 60% MRSA was observed in urine and blood isolates. Up to 40% increase in AMR was observed amongst these isolates obtained during COVID-19 period compared to pre-COVID-19 times. The overuse of antibiotics gave abundant opportunity for the bacterial pathogens to gradually develop mechanisms and to acquire resistance. Since the dynamics of SARS-COV-2 are unpredictable, a compromise on hospital antibiotic policy may ultimately escalate the burden of drug resistant pathogens in hospitals. A shortage of trained staff during COVID-19 pandemic renders it impossible to maintain these records in places where the entire hospital staff is struggling to save lives. This study highlights the extensive rise in the use of antibiotics for respiratory illness due to COVID-19 compared to antibiotic use prior to COVID-19 in ICUs. The regular prescription audit followed by a constant surveillance of hospital infection control practices by the dedicated teams and training of clinicians can improve the quality of medications in the long run and help to fight the menace of AMR.","Vikas, Saini Charu Jain Singh N.

METHODS: Patients with fever onset &#8804; 7 days presenting were enrolled. Nasal/oropharyngeal swabs were tested for influenza A and B viruses by PCR. Virologic data were obtained from the US World Health Organization (WHO) Collaborating Laboratories System and the National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS). We compared influenza A and B infections identified from SEDSS and WHO/NREVSS laboratories reported by US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) region using time series decomposition methods, and analysed coherence of climate and influenza trends by region. RESULTS: Among 23,124 participants, 9% were positive for influenza A and 5% for influenza B. Influenza A and B viruses were identified year-round, with no clear seasonal patterns from 2012 to 2015 and peaks in December-January in 2016-2017 and 2017-2018 seasons. Influenza seasons in HHS regions were relatively synchronized in recent years with the seasons in Puerto Rico. We observed high coherence between absolute humidity and influenza A and B virus in HHS regions. In Puerto Rico, coherence was much lower in the early years but increased to similar levels to HHS regions by 2017-2018. CONCLUSIONS: Influenza seasons in Puerto Rico have recently become synchronized with seasons in US HHS regions. Current US recommendations are for everyone 6 months and older to receive influenza vaccination by the end of October seem appropriate for Puerto Rico.","Paz-Bailey, Gabriela; Quandelacy, Talia M; Adams, Laura E; Olsen, Sonja J; Blanton, Lenee; Munoz-Jordan, Jorge L; Lozier, Matthew; Alvarado, Luisa I; Johansson, Michael A",Influenza Other Respir Viruses,,141

Working from home being 'the new normal', we explored potential solutions for collaborating and prototyping remotely from our own homes using the existing tools at our disposal. Since members of our cross-disciplinary team had different technical skills, we used a range of synchronous remote design tools and methods. We aimed to preserve the richness of co-located collaboration such as face-to-face physical presence, body gestures, facial expressions, and the making and sharing of physical artifacts. While meeting over Zoom, we sketched on paper and used digital collaboration tools, such as Miro and Google Docs. Using an auto-ethnographic approach, we articulate our challenges and strategies throughout the process, providing useful insights about synchronous distributed collaboration.","Losev, Tatiana; Storteboom, Sarah; Carpendale, Sheelagh; Knudsen, Soren",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.02306v2.pdf,141

245988,"Astronomy Data, Virtual Observatory and Education",2021-04-20,"BACKGROUND Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with lung inflammation and cytokine storm. Photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) is a safe, non-invasive therapy with significant anti-inflammatory effects. Adjunct PBMT has been employed in treating patients with lung conditions. Human studies and experimental models of respiratory disease suggest PBMT reduces inflammation and promotes lung healing. This is the first time supportive PBMT was used in a severe case of COVID-19 pneumonia. CASE REPORT A 57-year-old African American man with severe COVID-19 received 4 once-daily PBMT sessions by a laser scanner with pulsed 808 nm and super-pulsed 905 nm modes for 28 min. The patient was evaluated before and after treatment via radiological assessment of lung edema (RALE) by CXR, pulmonary severity indices, blood tests, oxygen requirements, and patient questionnaires. Oxygen saturation (SpO2) increased from 93-94% to 97-100%, while the oxygen requirement decreased from 2-4 L/min to 1 L/min. The RALE score improved from 8 to 5. The Pneumonia Severity Index improved from Class V (142) to Class II (67). Additional pulmonary indices (Brescia-COVID and SMART-COP) both decreased from 4 to 0. CRP normalized from 15.1 to 1.23. The patient reported substantial improvement in the Community-Acquired Pneumonia assessment tool. CONCLUSIONS This report has presented supportive PBMT in a patient with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Respiratory indices, radiological findings, oxygen requirements, and patient outcomes improved over several days and without need for a ventilator. Future controlled clinical trials are required to evaluate the effects of PBMT on clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.","Sigman, Scott A; Mokmeli, Soheila; Monici, Monica; Vetrici, Mariana A",Am J Case Rep,,141

However, cardiac safety of these drugs is still controversial in COVID-19. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate association of HCQ or HCQ+AZM treatment regimens, corrected QT (QTc) interval and malignant ventricular arrhythmias in hospitalized patients. METHODS: This is a single-center, retrospective, and observational study. All data were extracted from the electronic medical records. The initial and post-treatment mean QTc intervals were calculated and compared in patients with HCQ alone or HCQ+AZM therapy. Associated factors with QTc prolongation, the incidence of ventricular arrhythmia during treatment and in-hospital mortality due to ventricular arrhythmias were evaluated. RESULTS: Our cohort comprised 101 hospitalized COVID-19 patients (mean age of 49.60±18 years, 54.4% men). HCQ+AZM combination therapy group (n=56) was more likely to have comorbidities. After 5-days treatment, 19 (18.8%) patients had QTc prolongation, and significant increase in the QTc interval was observed in both two groups (p<0.001). However, HCQ+AZM combination group had significantly higher &#916;QTc compared to HCQ group (22.5±18.4 vs. 7.5±15.3 ms, p<0.001). All of 101 patients completed the 5-days treatment without interruption. Also, no malignant ventricular arrhythmia or death secondary to ventricular arrhythmia occurred during the treatment in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: The present study revealed that although HCQ+AZM treatment was independently associated with QTc prolongation, none of patients experienced malignant ventricular arrhythmia or death during treatment. Further prospective studies are needed to determine the exact implications of these drugs on arrhythmias in patients with COVID-19.","Özdemir, Ibrahim Halil; Özlek, Bülent; Özen, Mehmet Burak; Gündüz, Ramazan; Çetin, Nurullah; Bilge, Ali Riza",Int J Clin Pract,,141

We argue that physical loneliness (perceived lack of physical contact) constitutes a third dimension of loneliness that is particularly relevant in times of physical distancing. We conducted a longitudinal experience sampling study (N = 578) during the first 8 weeks of the COVID-19 lockdown in Germany to test this claim. The results indicate that loneliness has a three-dimensional structure encompassing emotional, social and physical loneliness. Each loneliness dimension explained a unique variance in perceived stress and psychological well-being. However, the three loneliness dimensions differed in their prevalence during the contact restrictions and their associations with age and personality. Physical loneliness was higher during the contact restrictions whereas emotional and social loneliness remained on a normal level. Age was positively associated with social loneliness but negatively associated with physical loneliness. Extraversion was negatively associated with emotional and social loneliness but positively associated with physical loneliness. These findings expand loneliness models, enhance loneliness assessment and improve the prediction of vulnerability to loneliness.","Landmann, Helen; Rohmann, Anette",,,141

251304,Privacy in time of a pandemic,2020,"The novel coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused a global pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which elicits a wide variety of symptoms, ranging from mild to severe, with the potential to lead to death. Although used as the standard method to screen patients for SARS-CoV-2 infection, real-time PCR has challenges in dealing with asymptomatic patients and those with an undetectable viral load. Serological tests are therefore considered potent diagnostic tools to complement real-time PCR-based diagnosis and are used for surveillance of seroprevalence in populations. However, the dynamics of the antibody response against SARS-CoV-2 currently remain to be investigated. Here, through analysis of plasma samples from 84 patients with COVID-19, we observed that the response of virus-specific antibodies against three important antigens, RBD, N and S, dynamically changed over time and reached a peak 5-8 weeks after the onset of symptoms. The antibody responses were irrespective of sex. Severe cases were found to have higher levels of antibody response, larger numbers of inflammatory cells and C-reactive protein levels. Within the mild/moderate cases, pairwise comparison indicated moderate association between anti-RBD vs. anti-N, anti-RBD vs. anti-S1S2, and anti-N vs. anti-S1S2. Furthermore, the majority of cases could achieve IgM and IgG seroconversion at 2 weeks since the disease onset. Analysis of neutralizing antibodies indicated that these responses were able to last for more than 112 days but decline significantly after the peak. In summary, our findings demonstrate the longitudinally dynamic changes in antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2, which can contribute to the knowledge of humoral immune response after SARS-CoV-2 infection and are informative for future development of vaccine and antibody-based therapies.","Feng, Xia; Yin, Jiming; Zhang, Jiaying; Hu, Yaling; Ouyang, Yabo; Qiao, Shubin; Zhao, Hong; Zhang, Tong; Li, Xuemei; Zhang, Lili; Zhang, Jie; Jin, Ronghua; Feng, Yingmei; Su, Bin",Front Immunol,,141

In this study, we investigate whether patients with ILD are more susceptible to COVID-19 than those without ILD and evaluate the impact of ILD on disease severity in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: A nationwide cohort of patients with COVID-19 (n=8070) and a 1:15 age-, sex-, and residence-matched cohort (n=121â050) were constructed between January 1, 2020 and May 30, 2020 in Korea. We performed a nested case-control study to compare the proportions of patients with ILD between the COVID-19 cohort and the matched cohort. Using the COVID-19 cohort, we also evaluated the risk of severe COVID-19 in patients with ILD versus those without ILD. RESULTS: The proportion of patients with ILD was significantly higher in the COVID-19 cohort than in the matched cohort (0.8% versus 0.4%, p<0.001). The odds ratio [OR] of having ILD was significantly higher in the COVID-19 cohort than in the matched cohort (adjusted OR=2.02, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.54-2.61).

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has triggered the development of internet hospitals that promote outpatient service delivery to the public via internet technologies. To date, no studies have assessed China's internet hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to elucidate the characteristics of China's internet hospitals and assess the health service capacity of these hospitals. METHODS: Data on 711 internet hospitals were collected from official websites, the WeChat (Tencent Inc) platform, smartphone apps, and the Baidu search engine until July 16, 2020. RESULTS: As of July 16, 2020, 711 internet hospitals were developed in mainland China. More than half of these internet hospitals (421/711, 59.2%) were established during 2019 (206/711, 29%) and 2020 (215/711, 30.2%). Furthermore, about one-third (215/711, 30.2%) of internet hospitals were established at the beginning of 2020 as an emergency response to the COVID-19 epidemic. The 711 internet hospitals consisted of the following 3 types of hospitals: government-oriented (42/711, 5.91%), hospital-oriented (143/711, 20.11%), and enterprise-oriented internet hospitals (526/711, 73.98%). The vast majority of internet hospitals were traditional hospitals (526/711, 74%). Nearly 46.1% (221/711) of internet hospitals requested doctors to provide health services at a specific web clinic. Most patients (224/639, 35.1%) accessed outpatient services via WeChat. Internet hospitals' consulting methods included SMS text messaging consultations involving the use of graphics (552/570, 96.8%), video consultations (248/570, 43.5%), and telephone consultations (238/570, 41.8%). The median number of available web-based doctors was 43, and the median consultation fees of fever clinics and other outpatient clinics were ¥0 (US $0) per consultation and ¥6 (US $0.93) per consultation, respectively. Internet hospitals have provided various services during the COVID-19 pandemic, including medical prescription, drug delivery, and medical insurance services.

A household survey suggested that there may have been more than 39 million SARS-CoV-2 infections in the United States by October 30, 2020, with an estimated infection fatality ratio of 0.64%;this compares with an estimated 7.3 million confirmed cases at that time. Several presentations found severe disruptions in HIV testing, prevention, and treatment services during COVID-19-related lockdowns;models suggest that severe interruption of antiretroviral therapy services could lead to a 1.5- to 3-fold increase in mortality. HIV testing remains the gateway to both treatment and prevention, and innovative strategies to improve testing uptake were presented. Preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) agents may delay detection of HIV infection using standard testing algorithms. Data were presented on promising investigational PrEP agents, including cabotegravir, islatravir, and the dapivirine vaginal ring. Progress is being made in point-of-care assays to measure PrEP adherence with tenofovir-based regimens. HIV incidence remains low in populations of PrEP users, with higher rates among persons who never refilled their prescription. More work remains to be done to increase PrEP uptake among populations most heavily impacted by HIV.","Buchbinder, S.; Liu, A.",Top Antivir Med,,141
252953,The COVID-19 vaccine and the dental team,2021,"Recent studies constructing direct interactions between the claim and each single user response (a comment or a relevant article) to capture evidence have shown remarkable success in interpretable claim verification. Owing to different single responses convey different cognition of individual users (i.e., audiences), the captured evidence belongs to the perspective of individual cognition. However, individuals' cognition of social things is not always able to truly reflect the objective. There may be one-sided or biased semantics in their opinions on a claim. The captured evidence correspondingly contains some unobjective and biased evidence fragments, deteriorating task performance. In this paper, we propose a Dual-view model based on the views of Collective and Individual Cognition (CICD) for interpretable claim verification. From the view of the collective cognition, we not only capture the word-level semantics based on individual users, but also focus on sentence-level semantics (i.e., the overall responses) among all users and adjust the proportion between them to generate global evidence. From the view of individual cognition, we select the top-$k$ articles with high degree of difference and interact with the claim to explore the local key evidence fragments. To weaken the bias of individual cognition-view evidence, we devise inconsistent loss to suppress the divergence between global and local evidence for strengthening the consistent shared evidence between the both. Experiments on three benchmark datasets confirm that CICD achieves state-of-the-art performance.","Wu, Lianwei; Rao, Yuan; Lan, Yuqian; Sun, Ling; Qi, Zhaoyin",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.09567v1.pdf,141
253726,Assessment and Promotion of Geotouristic and Geomining Routes as a Basis for Local Development: A Case Study,2021,"OBJECTIVE: The COVID-19 pandemic is a care crisis of unknown duration which has seemingly not yet reached its peak in many countries. A significant number of elderly and frail people and those with underlying serious illness will continue to develop severe forms of the COVID-19 infection. Most of them are not eligible for intensive care treatment but can still expect palliative care - in many cases provided by a Hospital Palliative Care Team (HPCT). Several teams have already gained experience in caring for these patients and their families, others are preparing for it. METHOD: We report on a COVID-19 patient with pre-existing acute myeloid leukemia who was looked after by a HPCT until death. We discuss the challenges and difficulties while caring for COVID-19-positive palliative patients in a non-ICU setting. RESULTS: Hospitalization of the patient in an isolation ward caused an enormous burden for the dying patient and his family. Symptom control was particularly difficult because of rapid deteriorating dyspnea and the scarce presence of medical staff in the patient's room. SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: COVID-19 patients who are not eligible for ICU treatment may have a particularly high need for palliative care. Since beds in specialist palliative care units are limited, the HPCT should be prepared to care for these patients. They may offer support in decision-making, optimize symptom control, and provide psychosocial care for patients and their families. Visiting restrictions aimed to protect the general public must be weighted against the patient's and family's suffering.","Anneser, Johanna",Palliat Support Care,,141

DEB is associated with higher HbA1c levels and increased risk of developing complications to T1D. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of DEB in a Danish cohort of children and adolescents with T1D aged 11-19 years and to characterize them regarding metabolic control and relevant clinical data. RESEARCH DESIGN & METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, we determined the prevalence of DEB using the revised Diabetes Eating Problem Survey (DEPS-R) questionnaire. HbA1c and relevant clinical data were obtained at the time they filled in the questionnaire. RESULTS: 192 children and adolescents (46% girls) aged 11-19 years with T1D were included from the pediatric diabetes outpatient clinic. A total of 40 participants (21%) had DEB. The prevalence was higher amongst girls compared with boys (34.1% vs 8.9%) and those who had DEB were older (16.7 vs 15.0 years, P < 0.001), had longer duration of T1D (7.5 vs 4.9 years, P < 0.001), higher BMI Z-scores (1.2 vs 0.3, P < 0.001), higher HbA1c (72.8 (8.8%) vs 62.0 (7.8%) mmol/mol, P < 0.001), higher total cholesterol (4.6 mmoL/L vs 4.2 mmoL/L, P = 0.0048) and LDL (2.7 vs 2.3, P = 0.001) compared with those with no signs of DEB. CONCLUSION: As in other countries, the prevalence of DEB is high in Danish adolescents with T1D. Early detection of DEB is essential to prevent short- and long-term complications to T1D.

In the general population, COVID-19 has mostnotably affected those who are female, in younger age groups, blackAsian and ethnic minority groups (BAME). A significant proportion ofrheumatology patients are 'clinically extremely vulnerable', classed ashigh-risk of COVID under current national guidance. While it isrecognised that extra precautionary measures in this group, such asstringent social distancing (shielding), adversely impacts thesepatients mental health, other risk factors, for patients with rheumaticdisease whose health related quality of life (HRQoL) scores are mostimpacted, have not being explored. In our large cohort of rheumatology patients under secondary care follow up at the RoyalWolverhampton Trust we assessed HRQoL scores at the 4-weekpoint following the introduction of lockdown measures.MethodsWe distributed a web-based survey via a linked mobile-phone SMSmessage, to all rheumatology patients, with a validated mobilenumber, under follow-up at the Royal Wolverhampton Trust. Weassessed patient's HRQoL by Short Form-12 version 2 (SF12);datawere analysed using SPSS version 26.ResultsThere were 7, 911 active follow up patients with linked mobile numbers.Survey responses were received from 1, 828/7, 911 (23%) and of these1, 727 completed all aspects of the SF12. Responders were mostlywhite British 1, 711/1828 (94%) and female 1, 276 (70%);inflammatoryarthritis was the predominant diagnosis (1, 275, 70%). 858 (47%) wereat high-risk of COVID (advised to follow shielding guidance) and 72(4%) reported having suffered COVID-19 infection. Mental SF-12(MCS) component scores were significantly lower in: COVID vs nonCOVID patients (mean differences: -3.8, P &lt; 0.001);BAME vsCaucasian patients (-1.5, P = 0.04);Females vs Males (-1.3, P = 0.001). Importantly, there were no differences in physical component scores (PCS) in these groups. Patients considered at high risk ofCOVID had lower MCS (-2.1) and PCS (-3.1) (both P &lt; 0.001). Olderpatients had lower PCS (-2.7, P &lt; 0.001) but not MCS.ConclusionWe found significantly worse mental health scores in female patients, BAME patients and those patients that had suffered the COVIDinfection. Clinically extremely vulnerable patients had worse mentaland physical health scores. There was no significant difference inmental health scores between patients in different ages groups, while, as might be expected, physical health scores were significantly worsein the older age groups. These data indicate a focus on adversepsychological consequences in specific patient groups may berequired for future increases in COVID infection rates.

We studied publicly available data of the Covid-19 patients in India and analyzed possible impacts of quarantine and social distancing within the stochastic framework of the SEQIR model to illustrate the controlling strategy of the pandemic. Our simulation results clearly show that proper quarantine and social distancing should be maintained from an early time just at the start of the pandemic and should be continued till its end to effectively control the pandemic. This calls for a more socially disciplined lifestyle in this perspective in future. The demographic stochasticity, which is quite visible in the system dynamics, has a critical role in regulating and controlling the pandemic.","Chanu, Athokpam Langlen; Singh, R. K.

Depending on the pathogen-associated molecular pattern, the NLRP3 inflammasome can play a crucial role during innate immunity activation. To date, studies describing the NLRP3 response during severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection in patients are lacking. We prospectively monitored caspase-1 activation levels in peripheral myeloid cells from healthy donors and patients with mild to critical COVID-19. The caspase-1 activation potential in response to NLRP3 inflammasome stimulation was opposed between nonclassical monocytes and CD66b+CD16dim granulocytes in severe and critical COVID-19 patients. Unexpectedly, the CD66b+CD16dim granulocytes had decreased nigericin-triggered caspase-1 activation potential associated with an increased percentage of NLRP3 inflammasome impaired immature neutrophils and a loss of eosinophils in the blood. In patients who recovered from COVID-19, nigericin-triggered caspase-1 activation potential in CD66b+CD16dim cells was restored and the proportion of immature neutrophils was similar to control. Here, we reveal that NLRP3 inflammasome activation potential differs among myeloid cells and could be used as a biomarker of a COVID-19 patient's evolution. This assay could be a useful tool to predict patient outcome.

We performed a robust, ecologic analysis comparing COVID-19 related mortality (CRM) between strictly selected countries based on BCG vaccination program status utilizing publicly available databases and machine learning methods to define the association between active BCG vaccination programs and CRM. Validation was performed using linear regression and country-specific modeling. CRM was lower for the majority of countries with a BCG vaccination policy for at least the preceding 15 years (BCG15). CRM increased significantly for each increase in the percent population over age 65. A higher total population of a country and BCG15 were significantly associated with improved CRM. There was a consistent association between countries with a BCG vaccination for the preceding 15 years, but not other vaccination programs, and CRM. BCG vaccination programs continued to be associated with decreased CRM even for populations < 40 years old where CRM events are less frequent.","Brooks, Nathan A; Puri, Ankur; Garg, Sanya; Nag, Swapnika; Corbo, Jacomo; Turabi, Anas El; Kaka, Noshir; Zemmel, Rodney W; Hegarty, Paul K; Kamat, Ashish M",Sci Rep,,141

258858,Improving indoor air quality through an air purifier able to reduce aerosol particulate matter (PM) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs): Experimental results,2021,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) has reached pandemic status and is affecting countries all over the world. The COVID-19 pandemic is accompanied by various stressors that require adjustment in everyday life and possibly changes in personal future prospects. While some individuals cope well with these challenges, some develop psychological distress including depressive symptoms, anxiety, or stress. Internet-based self-help interventions have proven to be effective in the treatment of various mental disorders such as depression and anxiety. Based on that, we developed an internet-based self-help program for individuals with psychological distress due to the situation surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic. The 3-week self-help program consists of 6 modules comprising texts, videos, figures, and exercises. Participants can request guidance within the self-help program (guidance on demand). The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and feasibility of the self-help program compared to a waiting control condition. METHODS: The design is a parallel group randomized controlled trial. Participants are allocated to a 3-week self-help intervention plus care as usual or a 3-week waiting period with only care as usual. There are follow-ups after 6 weeks and 18 weeks. At least 80 participants with COVID-19 pandemic related psychological distress will be recruited. Primary outcome are depressive symptoms. Secondary outcomes include anxiety and chronic stress, suicidal experiences and behavior, health-related quality of life, generalized optimism and pessimism, embitterment, optimistic self-beliefs, emotion regulation skills, loneliness, resilience, and the satisfaction with and usability of the self-help program. DISCUSSION: To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first studies investigating the efficacy of an internet-based self-help program for psychological distress due to the situation surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, the results of this study may give further insight into the use of internet-based self-help programs in pandemic-related psychological distress.

258932,An extended TODIM approach for group emergency decision making based on bidirectional projection with hesitant triangular fuzzy sets,2020,"Purpose of Review: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), continues to affect individuals, communities, and health systems worldwide. Here, we highlight how COVID-19 threatens to jeopardize the tremendous gains made over the last few decades on improving children's health globally. Recent Findings: In contrast to adults, children with COVID-19 are less likely to develop severe disease requiring hospitalization or die as a direct result of infection. However, the pandemic will likely have other important health impacts disproportionately affecting vulnerable children globally. Possible effects include worsening of poverty and food insecurity; disruption of already strained routine child health services; damage to already imperiled healthcare workforces; a wave of mental health challenges; interruption of education; and increased risks of violence, abuse, exploitation, and neglect. These challenges notwithstanding, the response to COVID-19 may also provide opportunities, such as for health system strengthening, that could improve child health after the pandemic. Summary: The negative impacts of COVID-19 on global child health may be substantial. However, these are not foregone conclusions and much can be done to mitigate the worst outcomes. Child health providers should advocate for an equitable response to COVID-19 that prioritizes the health of vulnerable children and furthers the gains made in global child health.","Garcia-Prats, Anthony J; McAdams, Ryan M; Matshaba, Mogomotsi; Thahane, Lineo; Butteris, Sabrina M; Conway, James H; Slutsker, Mandy; St Clair, Nicole E; Haq, Heather",Curr Trop Med Rep,,141

Currently there are no treatment options for it. Drug repurposing studies explored the potency of antimalarial drugs, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, against SARS-CoV-2 virus. These drugs can inhibit the viral protease, called chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease, also known as Main protease (3CLpro); hence, we studied the binding efficiencies of 4-aminoquinoline and 8-aminoquinoline analogs of chloroquine. Six compounds furnished better binding energies than chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. The interactions with the active site residues especially with Cys145 and His41, which are involved in catalytic diad for proteolysis, make these compounds potent main protease inhibitors. A regression model correlating binding energy and the molecular descriptors for chloroquine analogs was generated with R2 = 0.9039 and Q2 = 0.8848. This model was used to screen new analogs of primaquine and molecules from the Asinex compound library. The docking and regression analysis showed these analogs to be more potent inhibitors of 3CLpro than hydroxychloroquine and primaquine. The molecular dynamic simulations of the hits were carried out to determine the binding stabilities. Finally, we propose four compounds that show drug likeness toward SARS-CoV-2 that can be further validated through in vitro and in vivo studies.","Achutha, A S; Pushpa, V L; Suchitra, Surendran",J Proteome Res,,141

Underserved patients are most affected, and disproportionately may use opioid medications as they lack access to other therapies. It is therefore important to develop systems to treat spinal pain within the primary medical home. METHODS: We designed a prospective observational pilot study at a community health center to measure the effectiveness of two interventions among an underserved population: a multidisciplinary pain team and chiropractic care. Study outcomes were pain and functional disability measured by the Pain Disability Questionnaire (PDQ), and reduction of opioid dose at baseline and 6-12 months. Multivariate linear regression was used to determine associating factors for change in PDQ scores. RESULTS: Thirty-five individuals completed baseline and follow-up PDQs from August 2018 to May 2020. Overall, the mean baseline PDQ was 92.4 +/- 6.1 and the mean follow-up PDQ was 81.9 +/- 7.7, resulting in a mean improvement of -10.6 (95% CI 1.2 - -22.3, P = .08). Participants in the chiropractic team (mean change -25.0, P = .01) and those completing the study before COVID-19 (mean change = -22.6, P < .01) were found to have significantly greater improvement at follow-up. CONCLUSION: This observational study within a community health center resulted in improvement in spinal pain and disability with chiropractic care versus a multidisciplinary pain team. Offering similar services in primary care may help to address pain and disability, and hopefully limit external referrals, advanced imaging, and opioid prescriptions.","Prater, Christopher; Tepe, Melissa; Battaglia, Patrick",J Prim Care Community Health,,141

DESIGN: Preregistered prospective observational cohort study. SETTING: University hospital ICU. PATIENTS: All mechanically ventilated coronavirus disease 2019 patients admitted to our ICU during the first European pandemic wave. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: At 3 months after hospital discharge, 46 survivors underwent a comprehensive physical assessment (6-min walking distance, Medical Research Council sum score and handgrip strength), a full pulmonary function test, and a chest CT scan which was used to analyze skeletal muscle architecture. In addition, patient-reported outcomes measures were collected. Physical performance assessed by 6-minute walking distance was below 80% of predicted in 48% of patients. Patients with impaired physical performance had more muscle weakness (Medical Research Council sum score 53 [51-56] vs 59 [56-60]; p < 0.001), lower lung diffusing capacity (54% [44-66%] vs 68% of predicted [61-72% of predicted]; p = 0.002), and higher intermuscular adipose tissue area (p = 0.037). Reduced lung diffusing capacity and increased intermuscular adipose tissue were independently associated with physical performance.

Conceptually we take our cue from Norbert Elias and the way something as physiologically fundamental as coughing becomes the focus of etiquette and technique, touching also on themes central to Mary Douglas' anthropology of pollution. This is explored through four themes. First, we show how coughing becomes a matter of biopolitical citizenship expressed through etiquettes that also displace pollution anxieties to surroundings. Second, coughing is a question of being assisted to cough through the mediation of professional skills, interventions and devices. Third, coughing is seen to be central to the sonographic soundscape of the healthcare environment whereby people learn to recognise (and sometimes misrecognise) each other through the 'sound' of the cough. Finally, coughing properly can be seen to have both a 'time and a place' including the retreat of the cough from public space into risky confined spaces. Our conclusion speculates on the way these insights shed light on aspects of life that, until the Covid-19 pandemic, lay largely hidden.","Brown, Nik; Nettleton, Sarah; Buse, Chrissy; Lewis, Alan; Martin, Daryl",Biosocieties,,141

One 3-h virtual training session of 3 dialysis nurses was conducted before SAMI deployment. The SAMI was deployed in prolonged intermittent replacement therapy (PIRRT) mode to maximize patients covered per machine per day. Live on-demand vendor support was provided to troubleshoot any issues for the first few cases. After 4 weeks of the SAMI implementation, data on treatments with the SAMI were collected, and a questionnaire was provided to the nurse trainees to assess device usability. RESULTS: On-site installation of the SAMI was accomplished with remote assistance. Delivery of remote training was successfully achieved. 23 PIRRT treatments were conducted in 10 patients. 7/10 of patients had CO-VID-19. The median PIRRT dose was 50 mL/kg/h (IQR [interquartile range] 44 - 62 mL/kg/h), and duration of the treatment was 8 h (IQR 6.3 - 8 h). Solute control was adequate. The user response was favorable to the set of usability questions involving user interface, on-screen instructions, machine setup, troubleshooting, and the ease of moving the machine. CONCLUSION: Assembly of the SAMI and training of nurses remotely are possible when access to vendor employees is restricted during states of emergency. The successful deployment of the SAMI in our institution during the pandemic with only 3-h virtual training supports that operating the SAMI is simple and safe.","Yessayan, Lenar T; Heung, Michael; Girard, Francine A; Shaikhouni, Salma; Szamosfalvi, Balazs",Blood Purif,,141

262329,Combat COVID-19 infodemic using explainable natural language processing models,2021,"CONTEXT: While individuals with diabetes appear to be at similar risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection to those without diabetes, they are more likely to suffer severe consequences, including death. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a common and potentially lethal acute complication of diabetes arising from a relative insulin deficiency, which occurs more often in those with type 1 diabetes and in the setting of moderate to severe illness. Early reports indicate that among patients with pre-existing diabetes, DKA may be a common complication of severe COVID-19 and a poor prognostic sign. CASE DESCRIPTION: This clinical perspective explores the key elements of caring for individuals with DKA during the COVID-19 pandemic through 2 cases. Topics addressed include diagnosis, triage, and the fundamental principles of treatment with a focus on the importance of characterizing DKA severity and medical complexity to determine the best approach. CONCLUSIONS: As discussed, some tenets of DKA management may require flexibility in the setting of COVID-19 due to important public health goals, such as preventing transmission to highest risk individuals, reducing healthcare worker exposure to infected patients, and preserving personal protective equipment. Evidence for alternative treatment strategies is explored, with special attention placed on treatment options that may be more relevant during the pandemic, including use of subcutaneous insulin therapy. Finally, DKA is often a preventable condition. We include evidence-based strategies and guidance designed to empower clinicians and patients to avoid this serious complication when possible.","Palermo, Nadine E; Sadhu, Archana R; McDonnell, Marie E",J. clin. endocrinol. metab,,141

262738,Impact of COVID19-induced Lockdown on Air Quality in Ireland,2021-06-06,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: On 11 March 2020, World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 infection a pandemic. The risk of ischemic stroke may be higher in patients with COVID-19 infection similar to those with other respiratory tract infections. We present a comprehensive set of practice implications in a single document for clinicians caring for adult patients with acute ischemic stroke with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection. METHODS: The practice implications were prepared after review of data to reach the consensus among stroke experts from 18 countries. The writers used systematic literature reviews, reference to previously published stroke guidelines, personal files, and expert opinion to summarize existing evidence, indicate gaps in current knowledge, and when appropriate, formulate practice implications. All members of the writing group had opportunities to comment in writing on the practice implications and approved the final version of this document. RESULTS: This document with consensus is divided into 18 sections. A total of 41 conclusions and practice implications have been developed. The document includes practice implications for evaluation of stroke patients with caution for stroke team members to avoid COVID-19 exposure, during clinical evaluation and performance of imaging and laboratory procedures with special considerations of intravenous thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy in stroke patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSIONS: These practice implications with consensus based on the currently available evidence aim to guide clinicians caring for adult patients with acute ischemic stroke who are suspected of, or confirmed, with COVID-19 infection. Under certain circumstances, however, only limited evidence is available to support these practice implications, suggesting an urgent need for establishing procedures for the management of stroke patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection.","Qureshi, Adnan I; Abd-Allah, Foad; Al-Senani, Fahmi; Aytac, Emrah; Borhani-Haghighi, Afshin; Ciccone, Alfonso; Gomez, Camilo R; Gurkas, Erdem; Hsu, Chung Y; Jani, Vishal; Jiao, Liqun; Kobayashi, Adam; Lee, Jun; Liaqat, Jahanzeb; Mazighi, Mikael; Parthasarathy, Rajsrinivas; Steiner, Thorsten; Suri, M Fareed K; Toyoda, Kazunori; Ribo, Marc; Gongora-Rivera, Fernando; Oliveira-Filho, Jamary; Uzun, Guven; Wang, Yongjun",Int J Stroke,,141

263788,"Survey data of COVID-19 awareness, knowledge, preparedness and related behaviors among breast cancer patients in Indonesia",2020,"BACKGROUND: Patients with psychiatric illnesses are particularly vulnerable to highly contagious, droplet-spread organisms such as SARS-CoV-2. Patients with mental illnesses may not be able to consistently follow up behavioral prescriptions to avoid contagion, and they are frequently found in settings with close contact and inadequate infection control, such as group homes, homeless shelters, residential rehabilitation centers, and correctional facilities. Furthermore, inpatient psychiatry settings are generally designed as communal spaces, with heavy emphasis on group and milieu therapies. As such, inpatient psychiatry services are vulnerable to rampant spread of contagion. OBJECTIVE: With this in mind, the authors outline the decision process and ultimate design and implementation of a regional inpatient psychiatry unit for patients infected with asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 and share key points for consideration in implementing future units elsewhere. CONCLUSION: A major takeaway point of the analysis is the particular expertise of trained experts in psychosomatic medicine for treating patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.","Angelino, Andrew F; Lyketsos, Constantine G; Ahmed, M Shafeeq; Potash, James B; Cullen, Bernadette A",Psychosomatics,,141

264324,Post-Pandemic Cooperation between China and Central and Eastern Europe,2020,"The disease caused by SARS-CoV-2-CoVID-19-is a global pandemic that has brought severe changes worldwide. Approximately 80% of the infected patients are largely asymptomatic or have mild symptoms such as fever or cough, while rest of the patients display varying degrees of severity of symptoms, with an average mortality rate of 3-4%. Severe symptoms such as pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome may be caused by tissue damage, which is mostly due to aggravated and unresolved innate and adaptive immune response, often resulting from a cytokine storm. Here, we discuss how an intricate interplay among infected cells and cells of innate and adaptive immune system can lead to such diverse clinicopathological outcomes. Particularly, we discuss how the emergent nonlinear dynamics of interaction among the components of adaptive and immune system components and virally infected cells can drive different disease severity. Such minimalistic yet rigorous mathematical modeling approaches are helpful in explaining how various co-morbidity risk factors, such as age and obesity, can aggravate the severity of CoVID-19 in patients. Furthermore, such approaches can elucidate how a fine-tuned balance of infected cell killing and resolution of inflammation can lead to infection clearance, while disruptions can drive different severe phenotypes. These results can help further in a rational selection of drug combinations that can effectively balance viral clearance and minimize tissue damage.","Sahoo, Sarthak; Jhunjhunwala, Siddharth; Jolly, Mohit Kumar",J Indian Inst Sci,,141

The viral entry of SARS-CoV-2 depends on an interaction between the receptor-binding domain of its trimeric spike glycoprotein and the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. A better understanding of the spike/ACE2 interaction is still required to design anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics. Here, we investigated the degree of cooperativity of ACE2 within both the SARS-CoV-2 and the closely related SARS-CoV-1 membrane-bound S glycoproteins. We show that there exist differential inter-protomer conformational transitions between both spike trimers. Interestingly, the SARS-CoV-2 spike exhibits a positive cooperativity for monomeric soluble ACE2 binding when compared to the SARS-CoV-1 spike, which might have more structural restraints. Our findings can be of importance in the development of therapeutics that block the spike/ACE2 interaction.","Anand, Sai Priya; Chen, Yaozong; Prévost, Jérémie; Gasser, Romain; Beaudoin-Bussières, Guillaume; Abrams, Cameron F; Pazgier, Marzena; Finzi, Andrés",Viruses,,141

METHODS: We retrospectively collected data from the electronic medical record of patients in the Mayo Clinic Florida's COVID Virtual Clinic. Hundred and eighteen patients with detectable results for the virus were followed. Data reviewed in this study included (1) length of time from detectable to undetectable results; (2) length of time from onset of symptoms to undetectable result; (3) length of time from resolution of fever to undetectable result. RESULTS: Fifty-three percent of studied patients eligible for discontinuation of self-isolation had detectable viral RNA, and therefore, underwent repeat testing. In these patients, the mean from the date of their first detectable result to attaining an undetectable result was 14.89 days. The mean time for onset of symptoms to undetectable testing was 21.5 days. CONCLUSIONS: Hundred and eighteen patients with detectable results for SARS-CoV-2 were followed in the Mayo Clinic Florida COVID Virtual Clinic; 53% of patients still showed detectable viral RNA despite meeting CDC guidelines for discontinuation of self-isolation, prompting us to propose following a more cautious guideline that other providers could consider as a strategy to discontinue self-isolation, including increasing length of days since symptom onset.","Woodruff, Amelita; Walsh, Katherine L; Knight, Dacre; Irizarry-Alvarado, Joan M",Am J Infect Control,,141

The operating and management conditions for water reclamation plants in China have been changed since the outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic in China at the end of 2019 to prevent emerging viruses being spread through wastewater treatment processes and the reclaimed water that is produced. Removal of pathogens and trace organic compounds (e.g., pharmaceuticals and personal care products and endocrine disrupting chemicals) in a real water reclamation plant after the start of COVID-19 epidemic was studied. Disinfection byproduct formation caused by chlorine being added to meet disinfection requirements was also assessed. The pathogenic microorganism concentrations in effluent were <2 (most probable number)/L, and the removal rates for most trace organic compounds were >80% when advanced treatments were performed using ozone, ultraviolet light, and chlorine doses of 2 mg/L, 20.5 mJ/cm2, and 2-3 mg/L, respectively. The main disinfection byproduct produced at a chlorine dose of 2 mg/L and a residence time of 1 h was chloroform (at concentrations <15 µg/L). The results indicated that the water reclamation processes with modified conditions gave high pathogen and trace organic compound removal rates and reasonably well-controlled disinfection byproduct concentrations.","Zhang, Ting; Xu, Qi; Shi, Yu-Long; Chen, Zhuo; Lu, Yun; Yang, Hong-Wei; Xie, Yuefeng F; Hou, Li039; an,",Environ Pollut,,141

respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) with significant morbidity and mortality that is well documented This includes significant central nervous system (CNS) involvement that ranges from acute delirium to meningoencephalitis While acute symptoms and manifestations have been noted, long-term neuropsychiatric and cognitive outcomes remain unclear in convalescent COVID-19 patients Characterizing the convalescence is particularly important since 80% recover, yet the relationship between exacerbated cognitive dysfunction and COVID-19 remains unclear We describe 3 adults above age 65 who reported worsening cognitive symptoms in the convalescent stage of COVID-19 Methods Three adults above the age of 65 who noted worsening cognitive difficulties after SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 were evaluated in the Memory Clinic of the Duke Neurological Disorders Clinic Electronic medical records were retrospectively reviewed Exam included a comprehensive neurological evaluation, formal neuropsychological evaluation, and neuroimaging Prior history was collected for comparison with their current clinical evaluation profile data Results Patient 1 is a 69 year old diabetic, hypertensive male with a history of depression and a first-order relative and a maternal aunt with late-onset Alzheimer's disease dementia who presented for evaluation of memory loss first noted about one year prior but had significantly worsened in the five months since his recovery from COVID-19 He had documented antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 The patient reported forgetting when he had eaten and now

The aim of this study was to explore inequalities in the incidence and mortality rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccine uptake in various sociodemographic and population group strata in Israel. Methods We analysed nationwide publicly available, aggregated data on PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19 deaths between March 2020 and February 2021, as well as the first three months of COVID-19 immunisation according to sociodemographics, including population group and residential socioeconomic status (SES). We computed incidence and mortality rates of COVID-19. Comparisons between towns with predominantly Arab, ultra-Orthodox Jewish (the minorities), general Jewish populations, and according to SES, were conducted using generalised linear models with negative binomial distribution. Findings Overall, 774,030 individuals had SARS-CoV-2 infection (cumulative incidence 84•5 per 1,000 persons) and 5687 COVID-19 patients had died (mortality rate 62•8 per 100,000 persons). The highest mortality rate was found amongst the elderly. Most (&gt;75%) individuals aged 60 years or above have been vaccinated with BNT162b2 vaccine. The risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection was higher in towns with predominantly Arab and ultra-Orthodox Jewish populations than in the general Jewish population, and in low SES communities. COVID-19 mortality rate was highest amongst Arabs. Conversely, vaccine uptake was lower amongst Arab and ultra-Orthodox Jewish populations and low SES communities. Interpretation Ethnic and religious minorities and low SES communities experience substantial COVID-19 burden, and have lower vaccine uptake, even in a society with universal accessibility to healthcare. Quantifying these inequalities is fundamental towards reducing these gaps, which imposes a designated apportion of resources to adequately control the pandemic.

In this study we used daily infections situation report of COVID - 19 published by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) to estimate Nigeria's TD - R0 and then repeated the same for the six geo - political zones in the country. Estimates of TD - R0 values for the country from the 23&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; of March - 27&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; of May 2020 fluctuated with a maximum of 2.3 (95% CrI) on the 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; of April and a minimum of 0.83 (95% CrI) on the 16&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; May 2020. Despite the decline in TD - R0 since the early stages of the outbreak of COVID - 19 in Nigeria suggesting a fall in the expected rate of secondary infection apart from the northwest and the northeast geo - political zones values remain above 1.0 for other zones and the country, generally. The Kolmogorov - Smirnov (KS) test was used to test the null hypothesis stating that the means of TD - R0 across the geo-political zones does not follow the same distribution pattern. After making adjustments for Type 1 - error we accepted the null hypothesis (p &lt; 0.05) for six pairs of geo-political zones. We conclude that our findings are significant in studying the COVID - 19 epidemic in Nigeria and important in evaluating the strategies deployed by governments at the national and regional levels, thus, the same method can be replicated across Africa.","Bibi, M.

Infection rates are rapidly rising almost everywhere, and new approaches are required to both prevent transmission, but to also monitor and rescue infected and at-risk patients from severe complications. Point-of-care lung ultrasound has received intense attention as a cost-effective technology that can aid early diagnosis, triage, and longitudinal follow-up of lung health. Detecting pleural abnormalities in previously healthy lungs reveal the beginning of lung inflammation eventually requiring mechanical ventilation with sensitivities superior to chest radiographs or oxygen saturation monitoring. Using a paradigm first developed for space-medicine known as Remotely Telementored Self-Performed Ultrasound (RTSPUS), motivated patients with portable smartphone support ultrasound probes can be guided completely remotely by a remote lung imaging expert to longitudinally follow the health of their own lungs. Ultrasound probes can be couriered or even delivered by drone and can be easily sterilized or dedicated to one or a commonly exposed cohort of individuals. Using medical outreach supported by remote vital signs monitoring and lung ultrasound health surveillance would allow clinicians to follow and virtually lay hands upon many at-risk paucisymptomatic patients. Our initial experiences with such patients are presented, and we believe present a paradigm for an evolution in rich home-monitoring of the many patients expected to become infected and who threaten to overwhelm resources if they must all be assessed in person by at-risk care providers.","Kirkpatrick, A.

271093,A curriculum of mathematical practices,2021,"This original and ground-breaking interdisciplinary article brings together perspectives from gerontology, criminology, penology, and social policy to explore critically the nature and consequences of the lack of visibility of prisons, prisoners, and ex-prisoners within global research, policy and practice on age-friendly cities and communities (AFCC), at a time when increasing numbers of people are ageing in prison settings in many countries. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to pose challenges in the contexts both of older peoples' lives, wellbeing, and health, and also within prison settings, and thus it is timely to reflect on the links between older people, prisons, and cities, at a time of ongoing change. Just as there is an extensive body of ongoing research exploring age-friendly cities and communities, there is extensive published research on older people's experiences of imprisonment, and a growing body of research on ageing in the prison setting. However, these two research and policy fields have evolved largely independently and separately, leading to a lack of visibility of prisons and prisoners within AFCC research and policy and, similarly, the omission of consideration of the relevance of AFCC research and policy to older prisoners and ex-prisoners. Existing checklists and tools for assessing and measuring the age-friendliness of cities and communities may be of limited relevance in the context of prisons and prisoners. This article identifies the potential for integration and for cross-disciplinary research in this context, concluding with recommendations for developing inclusive research, policies, and evaluation frameworks which recognise and include prisons and older prisoners, both during and after incarceration.","Codd, Helen",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,141
271122,"Affordable Housing: The Same Problems, Only Worse",2020,"BACKGROUND: Patients with dementia are vulnerable during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, yet few studies describe their hospital course and outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To describe and compare the hospital course for COVID-19 patients with dementia to an aging cohort without dementia in a large New York City academic medical center. METHODS: This was a single-center retrospective cohort study describing all consecutive patients age 65 or older with confirmed COVID-19 who presented to the emergency department or were hospitalized at New York-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center between March 6 and April 7, 2020. RESULTS: A total of 531 patients were evaluated, including 116 (21.8%) with previously diagnosed dementia, and 415 without dementia. Patients with dementia had higher mortality (50.0%versus 35.4%, pâ=â0.006); despite similar comorbidities and complications, multivariate analysis indicated the association was dependent on age, sex, comorbidities, and code status. Patients with dementia more often presented with delirium (36.2%versus 11.6%, pâ<â0.001) but less often presented with multiple other COVID-19 symptoms, and these findings remained after adjusting for age and sex. CONCLUSION: Hospitalized COVID-19 patients with dementia had higher mortality, but dementia was not an independent risk factor for death. These patients were approximately 3 times more likely to present with delirium but less often manifested or communicated other common COVID-19 symptoms. For this high-risk population in a worsening pandemic, understanding the unique manifestations and course in dementia and aging populations may help guide earlier diagnosis and optimize medical management.","Harb, Amro A; Chen, RuiJun; Chase, Herbert S; Natarajan, Karthik; Noble, James M",J Alzheimers Dis,,141
271300,Introduction: responses to the coronavirus crisis,2020,"OBJECTIVE: The late 2019 COVID-19 outbreak has put the health systems of many countries to the limit of their capacity. The most affected European countries are, so far, Italy and Spain. In both countries (and others), the authorities decreed a lockdown, with local specificities. The objective of this work is to evaluate the impact of the measures undertaken in Spain to deal with the pandemic. METHOD: We estimated the number of cases and the impact of lockdown on the reproducibility number based on the hospitalization reports up to April 15th 2020. RESULTS: The estimated number of cases shows a sharp increase until the lockdown, followed by a slowing down and then a decrease after full quarantine was implemented. Differences in the basic reproduction ratio are also significant, dropping from 5.89 (95% confidence interval [95%CI]: 5.46-7.09) before the lockdown to 0.48 (95%CI: 0.15-1.17) afterwards. CONCLUSIONS: Handling a pandemic like COVID-19 is complex and requires quick decision making. The large differences found in the speed of propagation of the disease show us that being able to implement interventions at the earliest stage is crucial to minimise the impact of a potential infectious threat. Our work also stresses the importance of reliable up to date epidemiological data in order to accurately assess the impact of Public Health policies on viral outbreak.","Hyafil, Alexandre; Moriña, David","Gac. sanit.

271455,[Consequences of the corona pandemic on social networks in families at risk],2021,"In this paper, I argue that genetic screening for beta thalassemia major is ethically justified in the context of Vietnam. First, I differentiate genetic screening from the moral objections commonly associated with eugenics on the basis of the primary motive for screening (avoidance of suffering) and the preservation of voluntary choice. To lay the groundwork for ethical discussion, I explain the basics of beta thalassemia biochemistry and screening and the clinical picture of beta thalassemia major. I then elaborate on a specific example of the challenges of beta thalassemia major in Cyprus before moving on to the case of Vietnam and discuss the improbability of treatment for this disorder in Vietnam and therefore, the extensive suffering that it causes the Vietnamese people. This leads to my argument that a beta thalassemia screening in Vietnam would hold up the ethical principle of nonmaleficence and also preserves and enhances reproductive choice. I then propose that Vietnam's successful COVID-19 response can be used as a roadmap for beta thalassemia screening.","Riquier, Mai-Tram",,,141

Legitimizing Digital Identity in Times of Crisis,2021,"Background Emerging evidence links acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients with COVID-19 with higher mortality and respiratory morbidity, but the relationship of AKI with cardiovascular disease outcomes has not been reported in this population. We sought to evaluate associations between chronic kidney disease (CKD), AKI, and mortality and cardiovascular outcomes in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Methods and Results In a large multicenter registry including 8574 patients with COVID-19 from 88 US hospitals, data were collected on baseline characteristics and serial laboratory data during index hospitalization. Primary exposure variables were CKD (categorized as no CKD, CKD, and end-stage kidney disease) and AKI (classified into no AKI or stages 1, 2, or 3 using a modification of the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes guideline definition). The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. The key secondary outcome was major adverse cardiac events, defined as cardiovascular death, nonfatal stroke, nonfatal myocardial infarction, new-onset nonfatal heart failure, and nonfatal cardiogenic shock. CKD and end-stage kidney disease were not associated with mortality or major adverse cardiac events after multivariate adjustment. In contrast, AKI was significantly associated with mortality (stage 1 hazard ratio [HR], 1.72 [95% CI, 1.46-2.03]; stage 2 HR, 1.83 [95% CI, 1.52-2.20]; stage 3 HR, 1.69 [95% CI, 1.44-1.98]; versus no AKI) and major adverse cardiac events (stage 1 HR, 2.17 [95% CI, 1.74-2.71]; stage 2 HR, 2.70 [95% CI, 2.07-3.51]; stage 3 HR, 3.06 [95% CI, 2.52-3.72]; versus no AKI). Conclusions This large study demonstrates a significant association between AKI and all-cause mortality and, for the first time, major adverse cardiovascular events in patients hospitalized with COVID-19.","Rao, Anjali; Ranka, Sagar; Ayers, Colby; Hendren, Nicholas; Rosenblatt, Anna; Alger, Heather M; Rutan, Christine; Omar, Wally; Khera, Rohan; Gupta, Kamal; Mody, Purav; DeFilippi, Christopher; Das, Sandeep R; Hedayati, S Susan; de Lemos, James A",J Am Heart Assoc,,141

Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2) mRNA vaccine against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was granted emergency use authorization (EUA) by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in December 2020. EUA has been widely discussed in the medical literature and the general public. The safety of the BNT162b2 vaccine has been investigated in short-term trials with data available for three months. We present a case of a 96-year-old female with a past surgical history of cholecystectomy who presented with acute onset severe abdominal pain a few days after getting the first dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. She was diagnosed with acute pancreatitis with a lipase level of 4036 U/L. Extensive history and investigations were unable to find any etiology. The patient was conservatively managed and discharged home without any complications. There has been some data available in medical literature showing an association between acute pancreatitis and COVID-19 infection. Trial data of Pfizer COVID-19 also shows one case of acute pancreatitis in the treatment group. There have also been individual cases of unexplained acute pancreatitis shared by medical professionals on online forums. Our main goal to write this case is to make medical literature aware of possible emerging side effects of the COVID-19 vaccine, one of such side effects being self-resolving uncomplicated acute pancreatitis.","Parkash, O.; Sharko, A.; Farooqi, A.; Ying, G.

Corona and discursive othering in Arab media,2021,"BACKGROUND: Despite the rapid rise of publications pertaining to COVID-19, there is a lack of data examining patient outcomes following elective procedures performed during this pandemic. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this investigation is to: 1) examine the postoperative outcomes of patients that underwent elective procedures in an ambulatory surgery center during the COVID-19 pandemic; 2) share the preoperative screening and patient selection protocol implemented in our center. METHODS: Elective procedures performed in an ambulatory surgery center between March 1, 2020 and April 16, 2020 were retrospectively reviewed. The primary outcomes were occurrence of COVID-19 related postoperative complications. These complications include pneumonia, stroke, myocardial infarction, and clotting disorders. Predictive variables analyzed in this study were: age, American Society of Anesthesiologist (ASA) score, and specialty conducting the procedure, operating time, and the type of plastic and reconstructive surgery procedure being performed. RESULTS: A total of 300 consecutive electives cases were included in the study. The most common procedures were pain management (43.0%), gastrointestinal (26.0%), aesthetic (14.0%), orthopedic (10.3%), reconstructive (4.0%), otorhinolaryngology (2.0%), and gynecology (0.67%). The median age of the cohort was 54.6 years (range, 1-90 years) and the median procedure time was 47 minutes (range, 11-304 minutes). COVID-19 related symptoms or complications following the procedures were not observed in any of the patients nor the healthcare care personnel. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of 300 electives cases, we found no patients with COVID-19 related symptoms postoperatively. This suggests that with proper preoperative screening and patient selection, elective procedures can be safely performed in an ASC during this pandemic.","Couto, Rafael A; Wiener, Thomas C; Adams, William P",,,141

MATERIAL AND METHOD: In this retrospective study, we included 113 consecutive hypertensive patients admitted due to Covid-19 infection. In all patients, Covid-19 infection was confirmed with using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. All patients were on ACE inh/ARBs or other antihypertensive therapy unless no contraindication was present. The primary outcome of the study was the in-hospital all-cause mortality. RESULTS: In total, 113 hypertensive Covid-19 patients were included, of them 74 patients were using ACE inh/ARBs. During in-hospital follow up, 30.9% [n = 35 patients] of patients died. The frequency of admission to the ICU and endotracheal intubation were significantly higher in patients using ACE inh/ARBs. In a multivariable analysis, the use of ACE inh/ARBs was an independent predictor of in-hospital mortality (OR: 3.66; 95%CI: 1.11-18.18; p= .032). Kaplan-Meir curve analysis displayed that patients on ACE inh/ARBs therapy had higher incidence of in-hospital death than those who were not. CONCLUSION: The present study has found that the use of ACE inh/ARBs therapy might be associated with an increased in-hospital mortality in patients who were diagnosed with Covid-19 pneumonia. It is likely that ACE inh/ARBs therapy might not be beneficial in the subgroup of hypertensive Covid-19 patients despite the fact that there might be the possibility of some unmeasured residual confounders to affect the results of the study.","Selçuk, Murat; Çinar, Tufan; Keskin, Muhammed; Çiçek, Vedat; Kiliç, Sahhan; Kenan, Behruz; Dogan, Selami; Asal, Süha; Günay, Nuran; Yildirim, Ersin; Keskin, Ümran; Orhan, Ahmet Lütfullah",Clin Exp Hypertens,,141

275921,Film,2020,"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease that has been spreading very fast worldwide. Up to now, there is scarce information regarding the clinical features and short-term outcomes of infected patients with cancer. Methods: We performed a retrospective study in Wuhan Union Hospital from Feb 14, 2020, to Mar 15, 2020, China. Data were retrieved including demographic and clinical features, laboratory findings, and outcome data. Patients were classified into the discharged group and undischarged group by the 4-week outcomes from admission. Difference analysis and correlation analysis were performed between the two groups. Results: A total of 37 patients were enrolled in the study, including 27 cancer survivors in routine follow-up. Breast cancer (18.9%) was the most frequent cancer type, and common symptoms included cough (54.1%), fever (48.6%), and fatigue (27%). Lymphocytopenia and hypoproteinemia were much frequent in patients who had received chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or surgery within the past month. However, the concentration of D-dimer (median: 3.75 vs 0.43, P =0.010) and fibrin degradation products (median: 23.60 vs 1.80, P =0.002) were evidently increased in this population compared with cancer survivors. At the end of follow-up, 83.8% of the enrolled patients were discharged. Among the discharged, women (48.6%) and cancer survivors (67.6%) showed better short-term outcomes. The elevated level of FDP was significantly higher in the undischarged group (median: 21.85 vs 2.00, P =0.049). The proportion of CD3-positive lymphocyte cells and CD4-positive lymphocytes was correlated with short-term outcomes. Conclusion: Peripheral lymphocyte subset (CD3-positive and CD4-positive) on admission as a novel biomarker had a potential association with early efficacy. Cancer survivors in routine follow-up would achieve better short-term outcomes. COVID-19 patients with cancer should gain more attention and close monitoring.","Wang, Yong; Shan, Ben-Jie; Shen, Xia-Bo; Zheng, Chang-Cheng; Wang, Jin-Quan; Li, Gui-Ling; Pan, Yue-Yin",Cancer Manag Res,,141

276648,Decisionmaking and Leadership in Crises and Beyond,2021,"The conversion of methanol-to-hydrocarbons (MTH) is known to occur via an autocatalytic process in zeolites, where framework-bound methoxy species play a pivotal role, especially during catalyst induction. Recent NMR and FT-IR experimental studies suggest that methoxylated zeolites are able to produce hydrocarbons by a mechanism involving carbene migration and association. In order to understand these observations, we have performed QM/MM computational investigations on a range of reaction mechanisms for the reaction of zeolite bound methoxy and carbene groups, which are proposed to initiate hydrocarbon formation in the MTH process. Our simulations demonstrate that it is kinetically unfavourable for methyl species to form on the framework away from the zeolite acid site, and both kinetically and thermodynamically unfavourable for methyl groups to migrate through the framework and aggregate around an acid site. Formation of carbene moieties was considered as an alternative pathway to the formation of C-C bonds; however, the reaction energy for conversion of a methyl to a carbene is unfavourable. Metadynamics simulations help confirm further that methyl species at the framework acid sites would be more reactive towards formed C2+ species, rather than inter-framework migration, and that the role of carbenes in the formation of the first C-C bond will be via a concerted type of mechanism rather than stepwise.","Nastase, Stefan A F; Logsdail, Andrew J; Catlow, C Richard A",PCCP.

This study aims to explore the association between Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) deaths and weather parameters. In this study, we collected the daily death numbers of COVID-19, meteorological parameters and air pollutant data from 20 January 2020 to 29 February 2020 in Wuhan, China. Generalized additive model was applied to explore the effect of temperature, humidity and diurnal temperature range on the daily death counts of COVID-19. There were 2299 COVID-19 death counts in Wuhan during the study period. A positive association with COVID-19 daily death counts was observed for diurnal temperature range (r = 0.44), but negative association for relative humidity (r = -0.32). In addition, one unit increase in diurnal temperature range was only associated with a 2.92% (95% CI: 0.61%, 5.28%) increase in COVID-19 deaths in lag 3. However, both 1 unit increase of temperature and absolute humidity were related to the decreased COVID-19 death in lag 3 and lag 5, with the greatest decrease both in lag 3 [-7.50% (95% CI: -10.99%, -3.88%) and -11.41% (95% CI: -19.68%, -2.29%)].

279570,Individual differences in susceptibility to false memories for COVID-19 fake news,2020,"Suicide continues to be a global health concern, affecting all continents. Although some studies have associated it with mental disorders such as severe depression, research also shows that a significant number of cases occur due to emerging life stresses. It is one of the leading causes of death among young people and is steady on the rise in Malawi. Malawi's suicide cases disproportionately affect young males from rural areas. These cases are also higher than those of neighbouring countries. During the lockdown period to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic between April and September 2020, Malawi saw a rise in suicide cases, most of which were due to the resulting financial hardship. There is need to tackle the suicide epidemic holistically, on all tiers of intervention. People need to be equipped with socially acceptable coping mechanisms which are easily adaptable to a low resource setting. There is a need for initiative to be taken in training individuals who can manage mental ill health without overwhelming the health system. The entire health system and health policies should acknowledge the importance of mental ill-health and its consequences. Malawi needs to prioritise mental health issues, realising that indeed, there is no health, without mental health.","Banda, Gift Treighcy; Banda, Natasha; Chadza, Anthony; Mthunzi, Chisomo",Pan Afr Med J,,141

It is clear that we were not prepared for the COVID-19 pandemic which continues to cause great suffering around the world. Nurses and other health professionals everywhere must be involved in health policy planning and implementation of public health measures to combat this and future pandemics. Such preparation needs community policy involvement at grassroots levels and needs to be collaboratively instigated at international levels. The death so far of over 2000 nurses is unacceptable in this pandemic, and we need to better protect and sustain the workforce. The International Council of Nurses has been instrumental in data gathering of nurses' experiences during COVID-19. Key points from analysis of this data have been included in Second Progress Report of the World Health Organization's Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response. This paper summarises the key messages from this report, as well as the nursing shortage.

280111,Reinforcing Sustainability Assessment and Reshaping Technology Innovation for Highly Sustainable Manufacturing in the Post-COVID-19 Era,2020,"Bangladesh Rohingya camps have hosted 65,000 refugees fled from Myanmar only since 2017. Their compromised living environment and limited physical and socio-economic facilities make them highly sensitive to COVID-19. The Government of Bangladesh and international aid agencies have applied WHO's IPC (Infection, Prevention and Control) guidelines to mitigate the transmission of COVID-19 outbreak and enhance their resilience. However, Rohingyas often disregard these guidelines or become reluctant to follow them. Building on 10 in-depth interviews, 66 questionnaires, and observation, the study investigates the limitations and challenges of implementing these guidelines toward building community resilience. It assesses their resilience with a focus on Kutupalong camp, Cox's Bazar−one of the world's largest refugee camps. Findings reveal that Rohingya's past experience in association with their psychological trauma largely influences their current actions and demotivates to follow the health guidelines. Their deep mistrust of and disrespect to healthcare providers and aid agencies discourage them to follow the IPC. Also, insufficient built infrastructure and unhygienic living conditions, including improper WASH management, increase their risk to COVID-19. The study highlights a need for understanding their socio-psychological values and cultural narratives and recommends a set of guidelines for policymakers and aid agencies to build community resilience to COVID -19.","Akter, Salam Dhar Tapan Kumar Rahman Abid Ibna A.; Uddin, Md kamal",Journal of Migration and Health,,141
280158,Assessment of the impact of US Energy Policy on world oil prices,2021,"PURPOSE: To perform a systematic analysis of articles on the ophthalmological implications of the global COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: PubMed.gov was searched for relevant articles using the keywords ""COVID-19"", ""coronavirus"", and ""SARS-CoV-2"" in conjunction with ""ophthalmology"" and ""eye"". Moreover, official recommendations of ophthalmological societies were systematically reviewed, with a focus on the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) and the Royal College of Ophthalmologists (RCOphth). RESULTS: As of April 16, 2020, in total, 21 peer-reviewed articles on the ophthalmological aspects of COVID-19 were identified. Of these, 12 (57.1%) were from Asia, 6 (28.6%) from the United States of America, and 3 (14.3%) from Europe. There were 5 (23.8%) original studies, 10 (47.6%) letters, 3 (14.2%) case reports, and 3 (14.2%) reviews. These articles could be classified into the topics ""Modes and prevention of (ocular) transmission"", ""Ophthalmological manifestations of COVID-19"", ""Clinical guidance concerning ophthalmological practice during the COVID-19 pandemic"", and ""Practical recommendations for clinical infrastructure"". Practical recommendations could be extracted from official statements of the AAO and the RCOphth. CONCLUSION: Within a short period, a growing body of articles has started to elucidate the ophthalmological implications of COVID-19. As the eye can represent a route of infection (actively via tears and passively via the nasoacrimal duct), ophthalmological care has to undergo substantial modifications during this pandemic. In the eye, COVID-19 can manifest as keratoconjunctivitis.","Siedlecki, Jakob; Brantl, Victor; Schworm, Benedikt; Mayer, Wolfgang Johann; Gerhardt, Maximilian; Michalakis, Stylianos; Kreutzer, Thomas; Priglinger, Siegfried",Klin Monbl Augenheilkd,,141

Following extraction from collected Schirmer tear strips by methanol-water (4:1, v/v), the analyte and IS (azithromycin-d3) were separated on a Waters Atlantis&#8482; dC18 column (2.1 mm × 30 mm, 3 µm) by gradient elution with 0.1% (v/v) formic acid in methanol-water (1:9) and methanol-acetonitrile (9:1) as the mobile phase. Electrospray ionization in positive ion mode and MRM were used to monitor the ion transitions at m/z 749.6 â 591.6 (azithromycin) and 752.4 â 594.4 (azithromycin-d3). The results indicated that the method had excellent sensitivity and specificity. The analyte appeared to have good linearity in the range of 5-1000 ng/ mL. Both the intra-batch and inter-batch precisions (in terms of RSD) were <10%, and the accuracies (in terms of RE) were within ±15%. The lower limit of quantification, matrix effect, extraction recovery, stability and dilution integrity were also evaluated and satisfied the validation criteria. Artificial tears served as the surrogate matrix, and no matrix difference was found when compared with that of real human tears. Finally, this method was successfully applied in an ocular pharmacokinetic study in healthy volunteers following instillation of azithromycin eyedrops.","Wu, Feng; Zhao, Xiuli; Ni, Siyang; Yang, Bo",Pharmazie,,141

We propose to use temporal reproduction number an extension of effective reproduction number, to evaluate the efficacy of control measures, and establish a Monte-Carlo method to estimate the temporal reproduction number without complete information about symptom onsets. The province-level analysis indicates that the effective reproduction numbers of the majority of provinces in mainland China got down to < 1 just by one week from the setting of control measures, and the temporal reproduction number of the week [15 Feb, 21 Feb] is only about 0.18.

Most studies were retrospective, and results may not be generalizable due to differences in demographics, healthcare organization and surge capacity. We present a cohort of mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients from a resource-rich, publicly financed healthcare system. METHODS: Prospective study from a tertiary hospital. Consecutive SARS-CoV-2 positive adult patients admitted to the ICU for mechanical ventilation from 10 March 2020 to 04 May 2020 were included. Triage and treatment were protocolized. High-dose dalteparin was adjusted by D-dimer. Demographics, treatments and high-resolution physiological variables were collected. Outcomes were 30-day and hospital mortality. Data are medians (quartiles). RESULTS: Of the 1484 persons in the hospital catchment area testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, 201 (13.5%) were hospitalized. Thirty-eight (19%) patients were mechanically ventilated, of whom five (13%) died. Of the 163 patients treated with supplemental oxygen, eight (5%) died. In ventilated patients (75% males, age 61 (53-70) years), severe, moderate and mild ARDS was present in 25%, 70% and 5%. Tidal volume &#8804;8 mL/kg ideal bodyweight was achieved in 34 (94%) patients. Proning and neuromuscular blockers were used in 19 (54%) and 20 (61%) patients. Duration of ventilation was 12 days (8-23). D-dimer peaked at 3.8 mg/L (2.1-5.3), and maximum dalteparin dose was 15 000 IU/24 h (10 000-15 000). Despite organizational changes, a high degree of adherence to treatment protocols was achieved. CONCLUSION: In a prospective cohort study of mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients treated in a resource-rich, publicly financed healthcare system, mortality was considerably lower than previously reported in retrospective studies.","Søvik, Signe; Bådstøløkken, Per M; Sørensen, Vibecke; Langeland Myhre, Peder; Prebensen, Christian; Omland, Torbjørn; Berdal, Jan-Erik",Acta anaesthesiol. scand,,141

At each level the framework of primary, secondary and tertiary prevention can be applied.Primary Prevention (intervening before health is impacted): reducing academic stress;resilience interventions;mentorship;peer support;brief interventions to avoid progress to established disorders.Secondary Prevention (reducing prevalence of disorder): early detection through staff training and screening;treatment referral pathways;reciprocal arrangements if peers are placed within local settings.Tertiary Prevention (reducing impairment): reasonable adjustments, communicated between placementsThis recognises that medical students require a range of interventions at multiple levels to reduce stress, promote wellbeing and manage the spectrum of mental health difficulties they may encounter. The ecological framework also acknowledges the reciprocity of individuals being influenced by and influencing their environment, which aligns with the concept of co-production.","Bradley, Rhian Yousofi Tahmina Faruqui Rafey Hamilton-West Kate",BJPsych Open,,141

BaCo0.4Fe0.4Zr0.1Y0.1O3-Î´ with a perovskite-phase cathode has demonstrated efficient triple charge conduction (H+/O2-/e-) for high-performance cathode in low-temperature solid oxide fuel cell (LT-SOFC). Here we designed another type of triple-charge conducting perovskite oxide based on Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.1Fe0.7Zr0.1Y0.1O3-Î´ (BSCFZY) which formed a heterostructure with ionic conductor Ca0.04Ce0.80Sm0.16O2-Î´ (SCDC) showing both a high ionic conductivity of 0.22 Scm-1 and an excellent power output of 900 mW/cm2 in a hybrid-ion LT-SOFC. In addition to demonstrating that a heterostructure BSCFZY-SCDC approach can be a good functional electrolyte, the existence of hybrid H+/O2- conducting species in BSCFZY-SCDC was confirmed. The hetero-interface formation between BSCFZY and SCDC can be explained by energy band alignment which was verified through UV-Vis and UV photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS). The interface may help in providing a pathway to enhance the ionic conductivities and to avoid short-circuiting. Various characterization techniques are being used to probe the electrochemical and physical properties of the material containing dual-ion characteristics. The results indicate that the triple charge conducting electrolyte is a potential candidate to further reduce the operating temperature of SOFC, but simultaneously maintaining a high performance.","Rauf, Sajid; Zhu, Bin; Shah, M A K Yousaf; Tayyab, Zuhra; Attique, Sanam; Ali, Nasir; Mushtaq, Naveed; Wang, Baoyuan; Yang, Changping; Asghar, Muhammad Imran; Lund, Peter D",ACS appl. mater. interfaces (Online),,141

291281,Sustainability of the Slovak Spirits Industry in the Single Market of the EU,2021,"BACKGROUND: The endometrial luminal epithelium is the first point of attachment of embryos during implantation. Failure of embryos to firmly adhere results in implantation failure and infertility. A receptive endometrial luminal epithelium is achieved through the expression of adhesion molecules in the mid-secretory phase and is a requirement for implantation. Cadherin 6 (CDH6) is an adhesion molecule localizing to the endometrial luminal epithelial cell surface in the mid-secretory/receptive phase and knockdown of CDH6 in the Ishikawa cells (receptive endometrial epithelial cell line) compromises cell integrity. However, there are no studies investigating the role of CDH6 on receptivity and infertility. This study aimed to investigate whether CDH6 is dysregulated in the endometrium of women with infertility during the receptive window and the effect of CDH6 on endometrial adhesion and receptivity. METHODS: The expression and the localization of CDH6 in the human endometrium were determined by immunohistochemistry. Ishikawa cells were used to investigate the functional consequences of CDH6 knockdown on endometrial adhesive capacity to HTR8/SVneo (trophoblast cell line) spheroids in vitro. CDH6 knockdown was assessed by qPCR and immunoblotting. After CDH6 knockdown, the expression of type II cadherin family members and CDH6 functional partners were assessed by qPCR. Two-tailed unpaired student's t-test or one-way ANOVA as appropriate were used for statistical analysis with a significance threshold of P < 0.05. RESULTS: A significant reduction of CDH6 immunolocalization was recorded in the luminal and glandular epithelium of endometrium from women with infertility (P < 0.05) compared to fertile group respective cellular compartments in the mid-secretory phase. Functional analysis using Ishikawa cells demonstrated that knockdown of CDH6 (treated with 50 nM CDH6 siRNA) significantly reduced epithelial adhesive capacity (P < 0.05) to HTR8/SVneo spheroids compared to control and other type II cadherin family members likely failed to compensate for the loss of CDH6. The expression levels of CDH6 functional partners, catenin family members were not changed after CDH6 knockdown in Ishikawa cells. CONCLUSION: Together, our data revealed that CDH6 was dysregulated in the endometrium from women with infertility and altered Ishikawa cell adhesive capacity. Our study supports a role for CDH6 in regulating endometrial adhesion and implantation.","Zhou, Wei; Santos, Leilani; Dimitriadis, Evdokia",Reprod Biol Endocrinol,,141

Due to minimal microbial components, subunit (peptide-based) vaccines have demonstrated improved efficacies in stimulating immunogenic responses by host B- and T-cells. Materials and Methods Integrative immunoinformatics algorithms were used to determine linear and discontinuous B-cell epitopes from the S-glycoprotein sequence. End-point selection of the most potential B-cell epitope was based on highly essential physicochemical attributes. NetCTL-I and NetMHC-II algorithms were used to predict probable MHC-I and II T-cell epitopes for globally frequent HLA-A*O2:01, HLA-B*35:01, HLA-B*51:01 and HLA-DRB1*15:02 molecules. Highly probable T-cell epitopes were selected based on their high propensities for C-terminal cleavage, transport protein (TAP) processing and MHC-I/II binding. Results Preferential epitope binding sites were further identified on the HLA molecules using a blind peptide-docking method. Phylogenetic analysis revealed close relativity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV S-protein. LALHRSYLTPGDSSSGWTAGAA242→263 was the most probable B-cell epitope with optimal physicochemical attributes. MHC-I antigenic presentation pathway was highly favourable for YLQPRTFLL269-277 (HLA-A*02:01), LPPAYTNSF24-32 (HLA-B*35:01) and IPTNFTISV714-721 (HLA-B*51:01). Also, LTDEMIAQYTSALLA865-881 exhibited the highest binding affinity to HLA-DR B1*15:01 with core interactions mediated by IAQYTSALL870-878. COVID-19 YLQPRTFLL269-277 was preferentially bound to a previously undefined site on HLA-A*02:01 suggestive of a novel site for MHC-I-mediated T-cell stimulation. Conclusion This study implemented combinatorial immunoinformatics methods to model B- and T-cell epitopes with high potentials to trigger immunogenic responses to the S protein of SARS-CoV-2.","Sarma, Vyshnavie R.; Olotu, Fisayo A.; Soliman, Mahmoud E.

Several genes associated with protein ubiquitination have been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders. HECW2-related disorder has been established through the identification of de novo variants in HECW2 in patients with neurodevelopmental disorders with hypotonia, seizures, and absent language. Recently, we identified novel HECW2 variants in four Japanese patients with neurodevelopmental disorders. Regarding motor development, two of the patients cannot walk, whereas the other two can walk with an unsteady gait, owing to hypotonia. All HECW2 variants, including those that were previously reported, are missense, and no loss-of-function variants have been identified. Most of the identified variants are located around the HECT domain. These findings suggest that the dominant negative effects of missense variants around the HECT domain may be the mechanism underlying HECW2-related disorder.","Yanagishita, Tomoe; Hirade, Takuya; Shimojima Yamamoto, Keiko; Funatsuka, Makoto; Miyamoto, Yusaku; Maeda, Makiko; Yanagi, Kumiko; Kaname, Tadashi; Nagata, Satoru; Nagata, Miho; Ishihara, Yasuki; Miyashita, Yohei; Asano, Yoshihiro; Sakata, Yasushi; Kosaki, Kenjiro; Yamamoto, Toshiyuki",Am. j. med. genet,,141

An immunosuppressant host response to a primary disease can facilitate spreading of a subsequent emergent pathogen among the population. Social contact patterns within the substrate populace can be modelled using complex networks and it has been shown that contact patterns vastly influence the emergent disease dynamics. In this paper, we consider the effect of contact clustering on the coinfection dynamics of two pathogens spreading over a network. We use the generating function formulation to describe the expected outbreak sizes of each pathogen and numerically study the threshold criteria that permit the coexistence of each strain among the network. We find that the effects of clustering on the levels of coinfection are governed by the details of the contact topology.","Mann, Peter; Smith, Anne; Mitchell, John; Dobson, Simon",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.09457v1.pdf,141

The attrition stemming from this highly contagious disease particularly affects those rendered vulnerable by age and infirmity, including those with underlying cardiovascular disease. This article critically reviews how best to integrate supportive care into the management of those affected. RECENT FINDINGS: Numerous studies have described the pathophysiology of COVID-19, including that specifically arising in those with cardiovascular disease. Potential treatment strategies have emerged but there is limited guidance on the provision of palliative care. A framework for implementation of this service needs to be developed, perhaps involving the training of non-specialists to deliver primary palliative care in the community, bolstered by the use of telemedicine. The appropriate use of limited clinical resources has engendered many challenging discussions and complex ethical decisions. Prospective implementation of future policies requires the incorporation of measures to assuage moral distress, burnout and compassion fatigue in healthcare staff who are psychologically and physically exhausted. SUMMARY: Further research based on patient-centred decision making and advance care planning is required to ensure the supportive needs of COVID-19 patients with cardiovascular disease are adequately met. This research should focus on interventions applicable to daily healthcare practice and include strategies to safeguard staff well-being.","Hill, Loreena; Lambrinou, Ekaterini; Moser, Debra K; Beattie, James M",Curr Opin Support Palliat Care,,141

300886,Preprint abstracts in times of crisis: A comparative study with the pre-pandemic period,2021,"Policy attention to growing rural ""health care deserts"" tends to identify rural distance as a primary spatial barrier to accessing care. This paper brings together geography, health policy, and ethnographic methods to instead theorize distance as an expansive and illuminating concept that highlights place-based expertise. It specifically engages rural women's interpretations of rural distance as a multifaceted dimension of accessing health care, which includes but is not limited to women's health services and maternity care. Presenting qualitative research with 51 women in a rural region of the U.S., thematic findings reveal an interpretation of barriers to rural health care as moral failings rather than as purely spatial or operational challenges, along with wide communication of negative health care experiences owing to spatially-disparate but trusted social networks. Amid or owing to the rural crisis context, medical mistrust here emerges as a meaningful but largely unrecognized barrier to rural women's ability-and willingness-to obtain health care. This underscores how a novel interpretation of distance may inform policy efforts to address rural medical deserts.","Statz, Michele; Evers, Kaylie",Health Place,,141

302840,"The Energy and Environmental Footprints of COVID-19 Fighting Measures - PPE, Disinfection, Supply Chains",2020,"BACKGROUND: Planning for extreme surges in demand for hospital care of patients requiring urgent life-saving treatment for COVID-19, while retaining capacity for other emergency conditions, is one of the most challenging tasks faced by health care providers and policymakers during the pandemic. Health systems must be well-prepared to cope with large and sudden changes in demand by implementing interventions to ensure adequate access to care. We developed the first planning tool for the COVID-19 pandemic to account for how hospital provision interventions (such as cancelling elective surgery, setting up field hospitals, or hiring retired staff) will affect the capacity of hospitals to provide life-saving care. METHODS: We conducted a review of interventions implemented or considered in 12 European countries in March to April 2020, an evaluation of their impact on capacity, and a review of key parameters in the care of COVID-19 patients. This information was used to develop a planner capable of estimating the impact of specific interventions on doctors, nurses, beds, and respiratory support equipment. We applied this to a scenario-based case study of 1 intervention, the set-up of field hospitals in England, under varying levels of COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: The Abdul Latif Jameel Institute for Disease and Emergency Analytics pandemic planner is a hospital planning tool that allows hospital administrators, policymakers, and other decision-makers to calculate the amount of capacity in terms of beds, staff, and crucial medical equipment obtained by implementing the interventions. Flexible assumptions on baseline capacity, the number of hospitalizations, staff-to-beds ratios, and staff absences due to COVID-19 make the planner adaptable to multiple settings. The results of the case study show that while field hospitals alleviate the burden on the number of beds available, this intervention is futile unless the deficit of critical care nurses is addressed first. DISCUSSION: The tool supports decision-makers in delivering a fast and effective response to the pandemic. The unique contribution of the planner is that it allows users to compare the impact of interventions that change some or all inputs.","Christen, Paula; D039,; Aeth, Josh C; Løchen, Alessandra; McCabe, Ruth; Rizmie, Dheeya; Schmit, Nora; Nayagam, Shevanthi; Miraldo, Marisa; Aylin, Paul; Bottle, Alex; Perez-Guzman, Pablo N; Donnelly, Christl A; Ghani, Azra C; Ferguson, Neil M; White, Peter J; Hauck, Katharina",Med. care,,141

306460,Recoding of an industrial town: bioeconomy hype as a cure from decline?,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has occupied the world agenda since December 2019. With no effective treatment yet, vaccination seems to be the most effective method of prevention. Recently developed vaccines have been approved for emergency use only and are currently applied to large populations. Considering both the underlying pathogenic mechanisms of autoimmune/autoinflammatory rheumatological diseases (AIIRDs) and the immunosuppressive drugs used in treatment, vaccination for COVID-19 deserves special attention in such patients. In this article, we aimed to give simple messages to the clinicians for COVID-19 vaccination in patients with AIIRDs based upon the current evidence regarding the use of other vaccines in this patient group. For this purpose, we conducted a ""Pubmed search"" using the following keywords: Influenza, Hepatitis B, Pneumococcal, and Shingles vaccines and the frequently used conventional and biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Likewise, an additional search was performed for the COVID-19 immunization in patients with AIIRDs and considering such drugs. In summary, patients with AIIRDs should also be vaccinated against COVID-19, preferably when disease activity is under control and when there is no concurrent infection. Low-degree immunosuppression does not appear to decrease antibody responses to vaccines. Ideally, vaccinations should be done before the initiation of any biological DMARDs. Patients receiving rituximab should be vaccinated at least 4 weeks before or 6 months after treatment. Since tofacitinib may also reduce antibody responses, especially in combination with methotrexate, it may be appropriate to discontinue this drug before vaccination and to restart after 14 days of immunization. Key points â¢ COVID-19 vaccinations should preferably be made during remission in patients with autoimmune/autoinflammatory rheumatological diseases. â¢ Low-degree immunosuppression may not interfere with antibody response to vaccines. â¢ Ideally, vaccinations should be made before the initiation of any biological DMARDs. â¢ Timing of vaccination is especially important in the case of rituximab.","Soy, Mehmet; Keser, Gökhan; Atagunduz, Pamir; Mutlu, Melek Yalçin; Gunduz, Alper; Koybasi, Gizem; Bes, Cemal",Clin. rheumatol,,141
306519,"Analysis, Modeling, and Representation of COVID-19 Spread: A Case Study on India",2021,"OBJECTIVES: Rapid antigen testing (RAT) for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has lower sensitivity but high accuracy during the early stage when compared to reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). The aim of this study was to investigate the concordance between RAT and RT-qPCR results, and their prediction of disease transmission. METHODS: This single-center retrospective observational study of inpatients with COVID-19 was conducted from March 6 to June 14, 2020. Nasopharyngeal swabs were used to perform RAT and RT-qPCR. The primary endpoint was concordance between RAT and RT-qPCR results. The secondary endpoints were the factors causing disagreement in the results and the estimated transmissibility in RT-qPCR-positive patients with mild symptoms. RESULTS: Overall, 229 samples in viral transport medium (VTM) were obtained from 105 patients. The positive and negative concordance rates for VTM were 41% vs 99% (&#954; = 0.37) and 72% vs 100% (&#954; = 0.50) for samples collected on disease days 2-9. An increased body temperature (odds ratio 0.54) and absence of drugs with potential antiviral effect (odds ratio 0.48) yielded conflicting results. RAT was associated with the ability to end isolation (OR 0.11, 95% confidence interval 0.20-0.61). CONCLUSIONS: RAT and RT-qPCR results were highly consistent for samples collected at the appropriate time and could be useful for inferring the possibility of transmissibility.","Yamamoto, Kei; Suzuki, Michiyo; Yamada, Gen; Sudo, Tsutomu; Nomoto, Hidetoshi; Kinoshita, Noriko; Nakamura, Keiji; Tsujimoto, Yoshie; Kusaba, Yusaku; Morita, Chie; Moriya, Ataru; Maeda, Kenji; Yagi, Shintaro; Kimura, Motoi; Ohmagari, Norio",Int J Infect Dis,,141
306682,COVID-19: What Are Arabic Tweeters Talking About?,2020,"This narrative review summarizes the main aspects underlying the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, its epidemiology, pathophysiology, pointing to differences of SARS-CoV-2 main receptors ACE2, in terms of expression and the amount of soluble ACE2 in the circulation of children, men and women, and also in those with risk factors such as the smokers and pregnant women or presenting with comorbidities (diabetes, obesity, hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases, renal and CNS pre-existing diseases). Clinical manifestations in adults and children were also described, emphasizing the particularities already seen in children, regarding signs, symptoms, viral excretion time and the involvement of all organs and systems. The COVID-19 in the pediatric population was divided into two sections: one dedicated to previously healthy children and adolescents with COVID-19, and the other to those who live with comorbidities and acquired COVID-19. A few paragraphs were reserved to the recently described severe multisystemic inflammatory syndrome associated with COVID-19 (MIS-C) that shares certain characteristics with Kawasaki disease. Some studies on the infection in pregnant and postpartum women, as well as neonates were shown. This review has also covered the laboratory diagnosis of COVID-19, passing through the imaging diagnosis made by the chest tomography revealing ground glass patching opacities, and results of non-specific exams such as the total blood with lymphopenia, the coagulation tests with increased prothrombin times, as well as marked increments of the D-dimer, troponin and proinflammatory cytokines. In the section devoted to the specific laboratory diagnosis of COVID-19, the most used RT-PCR protocols were described and some studies on the serological diagnosis with IgA, IgM and IgG detection were detailed, including the use of rapid immunochromatographic assays and discussing the ideal period after the onset of symptoms to perform each type of test. In the end, the management of pediatric patients with COVID-19 based mainly on supportive measures has been briefly commented.","Yamamoto, Lidia; Santos, Emilly Henrique Dos; Pinto, Lacyane Silva; Rocha, Mussya Cisotto; Kanunfre, Kelly Aparecida; Vallada, Marcelo Genofre; Okay, Thelma Suely",Rev Inst Med Trop Sao Paulo,,141
307453,"Sharing economy research in hospitality and tourism: a critical review using bibliometric analysis, content analysis and a quantitative systematic literature review",2021,"PURPOSE: Several interactions exist between the GH/IGF axis and the immune system, including effects on innate immunity and humoral and cellular response. Acquired GH deficiency (GHD) has been recently proposed as a risk factor for severity of COVID-19 infections. However, acquired GHD is often associated to other factors, including pituitary tumors, surgery, radiotherapy, and additional pituitary hormones deficits and their replacements, which, together, may hinder an accurate analysis of the relationship between GHD and COVID-19. Therefore, we decided to assess the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and the frequency of symptomatic cases of COVID-19 in adults subjects with untreated isolated GHD (IGHD) due to a homozygous null mutation in the GHRH receptor gene. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out in 27 adult IGHD subjects and 27 age- and gender-matched local controls. Interview, physical examination, bio-impedance, hematological and SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies were analyzed. RESULTS: There was no difference in the prevalence of positivity of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies between the two groups. Conversely, no IGHD individual had a previous clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 infection, while 6 control subjects did (p = 0.023). CONCLUSION: The production of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was similar between IGHD subjects due to a GHRH receptor gene mutation and controls, but the evolution to symptomatic stages of the infection and the frequency of confirmed cases was lower in IGHD subjects than in GH sufficient individuals.","Melo, Manuela A; Borges, Lysandro P; Salvatori, Roberto; Souza, Daniela R V; Santos-Júnior, Hertz T; de R Neto, José M; Campos, Viviane C; Santos, Aryanne A; Oliveira, Carla R P; da Invenção, Grazielly B; Batista, Vanderlan O; Matos, Igor L S; Barros-Oliveira, Cynthia S; Dos Santos, Kezia A; Santos, Elenilde G; Souza, Nicolas A A; Melo, Enaldo V; Borges, Pamela C; Santos, Saulo E F S; de Oliveira, Brenda M; Oliveira-Santos, Alécia A; de Jesus, Amélia R; Aguiar-Oliveira, Manuel H",Endocrine,,141

309853,Systematic literature review on computable general equilibrium applications in tourism,2021,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic indirectly impacts HIV epidemiology in Central/West Africa. We estimated the potential impact of COVID-19-related disruptions to HIV prevention/treatment services and sexual partnerships on HIV incidence and HIV-related deaths among key populations including female sex workers (FSW), their clients, men who have sex with men (MSM), and overall. SETTING: Yaoundé (Cameroon) and Cotonou (Benin). METHODS: We used mathematical models of HIV calibrated to city- and risk-population-specific demographic/behavioural/epidemic data. We estimated the relative change in 1-year HIV incidence and HIV-related deaths for various disruption scenarios of HIV prevention/treatment services and decreased casual/commercial partnerships, compared to a scenario without COVID-19. RESULTS: A 50% reduction in condom use in all partnerships over 6 months would increase 1-year HIV incidence by 39%, 42%, 31% and 23% among MSM, FSW, clients, and overall in Yaoundé respectively, and 69%, 49% and 23% among FSW, clients and overall respectively in Cotonou. Combining a 6-month interruption of ART initiation and 50% reduction in HIV prevention/treatment use would increase HIV incidence by 50% and HIV-related deaths by 20%. This increase in HIV infections would be halved by a simultaneous 50% reduction in casual and commercial partnerships. CONCLUSIONS: Reductions in condom use following COVID-19 would increase infections among key populations disproportionately, particularly FSW in Cotonou, who need uninterrupted condom provision. Disruptions in HIV prevention/treatment services have the biggest impacts on HIV infections and deaths overall, only partially mitigated by equal reductions in casual/commercial sexual partnerships. Maintaining ART provision must be prioritised to minimise short-term excess HIV-related deaths.","Silhol, Romain; Geidelberg, Lily; Mitchell, Kate M; Mishra, Sharmistha; Dimitrov, Dobromir; Bowring, Anna; Béhanzin, Luc; Guédou, Fernand; Diabaté, Souleymane; Schwartz, Sheree; Billong, Serge C; Njindam, Iliassou Mfochive; Levitt, Daniel; Mukandavire, Christinah; Maheu-Giroux, Mathieu; Rönn, Minttu M; Dalal, Shona; Vickerman, Peter; Baral, Stefan; Alary, Michel; Boily, Marie-Claude",J. acquir. immune defic. syndr,,141

The continuous positive real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay for SARS-CoV-2 in the child's throat swab sample indicated the isolation period for suspected child cases should be longer than 14 days.","Lin, Jilei; Duan, Jun; Tan, Tingdan; Fu, Zhou; Dai, Jihong",Pediatr Pulmonol,,141

312126,Bayesian estimation of realized GARCH-type models with application to financial tail risk management,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic has sparked unprecedented mobilization of scientists, already generating thousands of new papers that join a litany of previous biomedical work in related areas. This deluge of information makes it hard for researchers to keep track of their own research area, let alone explore new directions. Standard search engines are designed primarily for targeted search and are not geared for discovery or making connections that are not obvious from reading individual papers. In this paper, we present our ongoing work on SciSight, a novel framework for exploratory search of COVID-19 research. Based on formative interviews with scientists and a review of existing tools, we build and integrate two key capabilities: first, exploring interactions between biomedical facets (e.g., proteins, genes, drugs, diseases, patient characteristics); and second, discovering groups of researchers and how they are connected. We extract entities using a language model pre-trained on several biomedical information extraction tasks, and enrich them with data from the Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG). To find research groups automatically, we use hierarchical clustering with overlap to allow authors, as they do, to belong to multiple groups. Finally, we introduce a novel presentation of these groups based on both topical and social affinities, allowing users to drill down from groups to papers to associations between entities, and update query suggestions on the fly with the goal of facilitating exploratory navigation. SciSight has thus far served over 10K users with over 30K page views and 13% returning users. Preliminary user interviews with biomedical researchers suggest that SciSight complements current approaches and helps find new and relevant knowledge.","Hope, Tom; Portenoy, Jason; Vasan, Kishore; Borchardt, Jonathan; Horvitz, Eric; Weld, Daniel S.; Hearst, Marti A.; West, Jevin",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.12668v2.pdf,141

We examined the effect of modifications of health literacy (HL) on depression and HRQoL. A cross-sectional study was conducted from 14 February to 2 March 2020. 3947 participants were recruited from outpatient departments of nine hospitals and health centers across Vietnam. The interviews were conducted using printed questionnaires including participants' characteristics, clinical parameters, health behaviors, HL, depression, and HRQoL. People with S-COVID-19-S had a higher depression likelihood (OR, 2.88; p < 0.001), lower HRQoL-score (B, -7.92; p < 0.001). In comparison to people without S-COVID-19-S and low HL, those with S-COVID-19-S and low HL had 9.70 times higher depression likelihood (p < 0.001), 20.62 lower HRQoL-score (p < 0.001), for the people without S-COVID-19-S, 1 score increment of HL resulted in 5% lower depression likelihood (p < 0.001) and 0.45 higher HRQoL-score (p < 0.001), while for those people with S-COVID-19-S, 1 score increment of HL resulted in a 4% lower depression likelihood (p = 0.004) and 0.43 higher HRQoL-score (p < 0.001). People with S-COVID-19-S had a higher depression likelihood and lower HRQoL than those without. HL shows a protective effect on depression and HRQoL during the epidemic.","Nguyen, Hoang C; Nguyen, Minh H; Do, Binh N; Tran, Cuong Q; Nguyen, Thao T P; Pham, Khue M; Pham, Linh V; Tran, Khanh V; Duong, Trang T; Tran, Tien V; Duong, Thai H; Nguyen, Tham T; Nguyen, Quyen H; Hoang, Thanh M; Nguyen, Kien T; Pham, Thu T M; Yang, Shwu-Huey; Chao, Jane C-J; Duong, Tuyen Van",,,141

314270,Off-campus Access to Licensed Online Resources through Shibboleth,2021,"Since December 2019, the COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 has been widely spread all over the world. It is reported that SARS-CoV-2 infection affects a series of human tissues, including lung, gastrointestinal tract, kidney, etc. ACE2 has been identified as the primary receptor of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein. The relatively low expression level of this known receptor in the lungs, which is the predominantly infected organ in COVID-19, indicates that there may be some other co-receptors or alternative receptors of SARS-CoV-2 to work in coordination with ACE2. Here, we identified twenty-one candidate receptors of SARS-CoV-2, including ACE2-interactor proteins and SARS-CoV receptors. Then we investigated the protein expression levels of these twenty-one candidate receptors in different human tissues and found that five of which CAT, MME, L-SIGN, DC-SIGN, and AGTR2 were specifically expressed in SARS-CoV-2 affected tissues. Next, we performed molecular simulations of the above five candidate receptors with SARS-CoV-2 S protein, and found that the binding affinities of CAT, AGTR2, L-SIGN and DC-SIGN to S protein were even higher than ACE2. Interestingly, we also observed that CAT and AGTR2 bound to S protein in different regions with ACE2 conformationally, suggesting that these two proteins are likely capable of the co-receptors of ACE2. Conclusively, we considered that CAT, AGTR2, L-SIGN and DC-SIGN were the potential receptors of SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, AGTR2 and DC-SIGN tend to be highly expressed in the lungs of smokers, which is consistent with clinical phenomena of COVID-19, and further confirmed our conclusion. Besides, we also predicted the binding hot spots for these putative protein-protein interactions, which would help develop drugs against SARS-CoV-2.","Guo, Dongjie; Guo, Ruifang; Li, Zhaoyang; Zhang, Yuyang; Zheng, Wei; Huang, Xiaoqiang; Aziz, Tursunjan; Zhang, Yang; Liu, Lijun",,,141

Methods: TCMSP, BATMAN-TCM, CNKI and Pubmed databases were used to search the compounds and targets of BHC and GeneCards database was used to search the targets of COVID-19; The intersection method was used to obtain the targets related to the therapeutic effect of BHC. Cytoscape 3.7.2 software was applied for the construction of CMM-compounds-targets network map. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed by STRING database. Gene ontology (GO) functional enrichment analysis and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis were conducted by DAVID. AutoDock Tools 1.5.6 and AutoDock vina 1.1.2 were used for molecular docking. Results: A total of 32 potential active components were screened from BHC, corresponding to 203 targets. Among them, there were 11 core compounds and 52 core targets. PPI network analysis showed that there were 25 key targets intervening COVID-19 by BHC. A total of 251 biological processes (P &lt; 0.05) and 93 pathways (P &lt; 0.05) were obtained by GO analysis and KEGG analysis, respectively. The results of molecular docking showed that the key compounds had good affinity with SARS-CoV-2 3CL hydrolase and angiotensin converting enzyme II. Conclusion: The active compounds of BHC can target IL6, MAPK8, PTGS2, PTGS1 and NCOA2 to regulate multiple signal pathways, and play a therapeutic role in the recovery period of COVID-19.","Guo, Sheng; Wu, Wen-Xing; Xie, Hong; Li, Quan; Wang, Heng-Bin; Duan, Jin-Ao",Chin.

More than 1,051,635 confirmed cases (and counting) have been reported worldwide, thus far, and both local and international travelers are considered to represent populations at high risk of acquiring the infection. Many factors are involved in the spread of this viral agent, including travel to and from endemic areas, a history of contact with a traveler from an endemic country, the virus infection rate at the destination, individual health, and inadequate prevention and control measures. COVID-19 symptoms range from fever and cough to difficulty breathing, and more severe cases can present with pneumonia and multi-organ failure. The virus is thought to be transmitted through large respiratory droplets, generated by coughing or sneezing and transmitted through close contact with infected persons or contaminated surfaces. Diagnostic strategies include the assays for the detection of antiviral antibodies, multiplex nucleic acid amplification, and microarray-based assays. Currently, no approved antiviral therapy or vaccine exists to treat or prevent the infection. Public health measures, such as quarantine, have been enforced, to slow the community spread of the virus, by governments, worldwide. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have recommended COVID-19 infection screening be performed at airports, for all travelers, before traveling to endemic countries and the restriction of travel to countries more than one thousand cases of infection. In response to the global outbreak, this review examines COVID-19 as a potential traveler’s infection.","Oti, Victor B.; Ioannou, Marina",Jurnal Kesehatan Masyarakat Nasional,,141

322238,Outlook: Education and the digital environmental humanities,2021,"Purpose: The forced shift to online teaching delivery during COVID-19 suppression measures in 2020 was a complex challenge for Australian teachers. Teachers were given very little time to prepare online content and very little professional development to teach online. Their experiences prompted discussion about the abilities of pre-service teachers (PST) to adapt content to online delivery if another pandemic occurred while they were teaching in the future. Design/methodology/approach: PST majoring in Health and Physical Education were required to adapt a 4-weeks high school health education unit for online delivery. This study analysed data from PST personal reflections and focus groups to gain a better understanding of their perceptions about teaching health education online and their confidence to adapt tasks and activities from face-to-face delivery or develop unique online tasks. Findings: PST reported varied confidence and competence to plan for and engage in online health education teaching. PST were concerned about student learning and engagement online, and unsure how to best differentiate activities to ensure all student could meet the intended outcomes. Originality/value: Little is known about the confidence and competence of PST to deliver fully online school health education. It is important to know more about this phenomenon to inform teacher education and teacher professional development to ensure teachers are better prepared for online delivery in the future. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Cruickshank, V.; Mainsbridge, C.",Health Education,,141

The Big Five personality traits-openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and emotional stability-were assessed with the International Personality Item Pool. Students were asked whether they kept up with the COVID-19 news, followed specific governmental rules and recommendations (washing hands more, using public transport less, avoiding larger crowds, and restricting meetings with family/friends), hoarded supplies, felt less secure in public places, or expected financial losses due to the crisis. Logistic regressions adjusted for sociodemographic factors and cognitive abilities revealed that more conscientious (odds ratio (OR) = 1.133) and more agreeable (OR = 1.285) students kept up with the news more. More agreeable students were also more likely to wash their hands more often/intensively (OR = 1.262), use public transport less (OR = 1.182), avoid crowds (OR = 1.320), and restrict meetings with family/friends (OR = 1.410). Other Big Five traits were not associated with these behaviors, except that less emotionally stable individuals tended to use public transport less often (OR = 1.162). Additionally, less emotionally stable students, in particular, more often bought more supplies than usual (OR = 1.322), felt insecure in public spaces (OR = 1.597), and expected financial losses (OR = 1.270). Moreover, less open (OR = 0.876) and more conscientious (OR = 1.235) students more often felt insecure in public spaces, and more extraverted individuals more often expected financial losses (OR = 1.180). Taken together, our findings suggest that more agreeable individuals, in particular, tend to comply with governmental rules and recommendations to fight COVID-19, whereas less emotionally stable individuals, in particular, tend to hoard supplies, feel insecure, and fear financial losses due to the crisis.","Asselmann, Eva; Borghans, Lex; Montizaan, Raymond; Seegers, Philipp",PLoS One,,141

We present patient and management characteristics, and outcomes for the entire cohort of adult (>18 years) COVID-19 patients admitted to Norwegian intensive care units (ICU) from 10 March to 19 June 2020. METHODS: Data were collected from The Norwegian intensive care and pandemic registry (NIPaR). Demographics, co-morbidities, management characteristics and outcomes are described. ICU length of stay (LOS) was analysed with linear regression, and associations between risk factors and mortality were quantified using Cox regression. RESULTS: In total, 217 patients were included. The male to female ratio was 3:1 and the median age was 63 years. A majority (70%) had one or more co-morbidities, most frequently cardiovascular disease (39%), chronic lung disease (22%), diabetes mellitus (20%), and obesity (17%). Most patients were admitted for acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure (AHRF) (91%) and invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) was used in 86%, prone ventilation in 38% and 25% of patients received a tracheostomy. Vasoactive drugs were used in 79% and renal replacement therapy in 15%. Median ICU LOS and time of MV was 14.0 and 12.0 days. At end of follow-up 45 patients (21%) were dead. Age, co-morbidities and severity of illness at admission were predictive of death. Severity of AHRF and male gender were associated with LOS. CONCLUSIONS: In this national cohort of COVID-19 patients, mortality was low and attributable to known risk factors. Importantly, prolonged length-of-stay must be taken into account when planning for resource allocation for any next surge.","Laake, Jon H; Buanes, Eirik A; Småstuen, Milada C; Kvåle, Reidar; Olsen, Brita F; Rustøen, Tone; Strand, Kristian; Sørensen, Vibecke; Hofsø, Kristin",Acta anaesthesiol. scand,,141
323587,Negotiating Civil War: The Politics of International Regime Design,2021,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has spread at an alarming speed, and effective treatment for the disease is still lacking. The body of evidence on COVID-19 has been increasing at an impressive pace, creating the need for a method to rapidly assess the current knowledge and identify key information. Gold standard methods such as systematic reviews and meta-analyses are regarded unsuitable because they have a narrow scope and are very time consuming. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the published scientific literature on COVID-19 and map the research evolution during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We performed a PubMed search to analyze the titles, keywords, and abstracts of published papers on COVID-19. We used latent Dirichlet allocation modeling to extract topics and conducted a trend analysis to understand the temporal changes in research for each topic, journal impact factor (JIF), and geographic origin. RESULTS: Based on our search, we identified 16,670 relevant articles dated between February 14, 2020, and June 1, 2020. Of these, 6 articles were reports from peer-reviewed randomized trials on patients with COVID-19. We identified 14 main research topics, of which the most common topics were health care responses (2812/16,670, 16.86%) and clinical manifestations (1828/16,670, 10.91%). We found an increasing trend for research on clinical manifestations and protective measures and a decreasing trend for research on disease transmission, epidemiology, health care response, and radiology. Publications on protective measures, immunology, and clinical manifestations were associated with the highest JIF. The overall median JIF was 3.7 (IQR 2.6-5.9), and we found that the JIF for these publications declined over time. The top countries producing research were the United States, China, Italy, and the United Kingdom. CONCLUSIONS: In less than 6 months since the novel coronavirus was first detected, a remarkably high number of research articles on COVID-19 have been published. Here, we discuss and present the temporal changes in the available COVID-19 research during the early phase of the pandemic. Our findings may aid researchers and policy makers to form a structured view of the current COVID-19 evidence base and provide further research directions.","Älgå, Andreas; Eriksson, Oskar; Nordberg, Martin",J Med Internet Res,,141

Powered prostheses can reduce this instability of passive prostheses. While shown to be more stable in practice, powered prostheses generally use model-independent control methods that lack formal guarantees of stability and rely on heuristic tuning. Recent work overcame one of the limitations of model-based prosthesis control by developing a class of stable prosthesis subsystem controllers independent of the human model, except for its interaction forces with the prosthesis. Our work realizes the first model-dependent prosthesis controller that uses in-the-loop on-board real-time force sensing at the interface between the human and prosthesis and at the ground, resulting in stable human-prosthesis walking and increasing the validity of our formal guarantees of stability. Experimental results demonstrate this controller using force sensors outperforms the controller when not using force sensors with better tracking performance and more consistent tracking performance across 4 types of terrain.","Gehlhar, Rachel; Yang, Je-han; Ames, Aaron D.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.11561v2.pdf,141

RESULTS: As the disease progression in COVID-19 patients, CD8+ T and NK cells were significantly decreased in absolute number but highly activated. After patients' condition improved, the count and immune status of CD8+ T and NK cells restored to some extent. GrA+CD8+ T and perforin+ NK cells had good sensitivity and specificity for assisting diagnosis of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: As the disease progression, the declined lymphocytes in COVID-19 patients might lead to compensatory activation of CD8+ T and NK cells.

Few reports exist in Latin America, a current epicenter of transmission. Here, we aim to describe the epidemiology and outcomes associated with COVID-19 in Honduras. METHODS: Baseline clinical and epidemiological information of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR confirmed cases detected between March 17th-May 4th in the San Pedro Sula Metropolitan area was collected, and, for hospitalized cases, clinical data was abstracted. Logistic regression models were fit to determine factors associated with hospitalization. RESULTS: 877 COVID-19 cases were identified of which 25% (n=220) were hospitalized. The 19-44-year age group (57.8%) and males (61.3%) were predominant in overall COVID-19 cases. 34% of the cases (n=299) had at least one pre-existing medical condition. Individuals aged 45-69 years [aOR= 4.05, 95% CI: 2.85-5.76], &#8805;70 years [aOR= 9.12, 95% CI:5.24-15.86], of male sex [aOR =1.72, CI 95%: 1.21-2.44] and those with a pre-existing condition [aOR= 2.12, 95% CI: 1.43-3.14] had a higher odd of hospitalization. Fifty percent of inpatients were hospitalized more than 7 days. Median length of hospitalization was 13 days [IQR: 8-29] among individuals aged 19-44 years, and 17 days [IQR: 11-24.6] among those aged 45-69. Forty-two percent of the fatal cases occurred among adults under 60 years old. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that a high proportion of COVID-19 cases in Honduras occurred among younger adults, who also constituted a significant proportion of severe and fatal cases.

The descendants of these viruses have adapted to the human host and evolved to evade immune pressure. Coronaviruses acquire substitutions more slowly than other RNA viruses. In the spike glycoprotein, we found that recurrent deletions overcome this slow substitution rate. Deletion variants arise in diverse genetic and geographic backgrounds, transmit efficiently, and are present in novel lineages, including those of current global concern. They frequently occupy recurrent deletion regions (RDRs), which map to defined antibody epitopes. Deletions in RDRs confer resistance to neutralizing antibodies. By altering stretches of amino acids, deletions appear to accelerate SARS-CoV-2 antigenic evolution and may, more generally, drive adaptive evolution.","McCarthy, Kevin R; Rennick, Linda J; Nambulli, Sham; Robinson-McCarthy, Lindsey R; Bain, William G; Haidar, Ghady; Duprex, W Paul",Science,,141

A thorough literature search of the PubMed/Embase/Web of Science/Cochrane central database was conducted to identify the impact of COVID-19 on oral health. We reviewed the recommendations on the recent guidelines set by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention infection control practices for dentistry, American Dental Association, and the World Health Organization. According to the available evidence, COVID-19 may have a negative impact on the oral health due to the infection itself and due to various other consequences such as therapeutic measures, xerostomia, and other complications of the COVID-19. In light of the above facts, dentists should be wary of the disease, its identification, mode of spread and impacts on the oral health. The dental personnel have been identified as at the highest risk of getting COVID-19 due to cross infection from contact with their patients and aerosols generated in routine dental procedures. As such, they should be aware of the modifications that need to be made to the practice to prevent transmission of the disease. It is evident that COVID-19 has a negative impact on the oral health and at the same time a significant transmission risk to the dental personnel and patients who visit the clinic. If the recommendations issued by the regulatory authorities are meticulously followed, the risk of disease transmission can be lessened.","Farook, Fathima Fazrina; Mohamed Nuzaim, Mohamed Nizam; Taha Ababneh, Khansa; Alshammari, Abdulsalam; Alkadi, Lubna",European journal of dentistry,,141

An agent-based model's (ABM) complexity grows as the number of parameters required to be calibrated increases. This parameter expansion leads to the ABMS equivalent of the \say{curse of dimensionality}. In particular, infeasible computational requirements searching an infinite parameter space. We propose a more comprehensive and adaptive ABMS Framework that can effectively swap out parameterisation strategies and surrogate models to parameterise an infectious disease ABM. This framework allows us to evaluate different strategy-surrogate combinations' performance in accuracy and efficiency (speedup). We show that we achieve better than parity in accuracy across the surrogate assisted sampling strategies and the baselines. Also, we identify that the Metric Stochastic Response Surface strategy combined with the Support Vector Machine surrogate is the best overall in getting closest to the true synthetic parameters. Also, we show that DYnamic COOrdindate Search Using Response Surface Models with XGBoost as a surrogate attains in combination the highest probability of approximating a cumulative synthetic daily infection data distribution and achieves the most significant speedup with regards to our analysis. Lastly, we show in a real-world setting that DYCORS XGBoost and MSRS SVM can approximate the real world cumulative daily infection distribution with $97.12$\% and $96.75$\% similarity respectively.","Perumal, Rylan; Zyl, Terence L van",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.08809v1.pdf,141

This global event is also a ""learnable moment"" for medical education-an opportunity to decisively incorporate public health, including public health systems, through the continuum of medical education. Although medical educators have made progress in integrating public health content into medical curricula, ""public health"" is not a phrase that is consistently used in curricular standards, and public health colleagues are not identified as unique and essential partners to improve and protect health. The COVID-19 crisis has demonstrated how a strong public health system is necessary to support the health of patients and populations, as well as the practice of medicine. Partnerships between medical and public health communities, through individual- and population-based interventions, can also more effectively combat more common threats to health, such as chronic diseases, health inequities, and substance abuse.To achieve a more effective medicine-public health relationship in practice, curricula across the continuum of medical education must include explanations of public health systems, the responsibilities of physicians to their local and state governmental public health agencies, and opportunities for collaboration. Medical education should also prepare physicians to advocate for public health policies, programs, and funding in order to improve and protect the health of their patients and communities. Pandemic COVID-19 demonstrates with laser focus that all physicians are part of public health systems, and that public health content has a distinct and critical place across the continuum of medical education to prepare physicians to participate in, collaborate with, and advocate for public health systems.","Maeshiro, Rika; Carney, Jan K",Acad. med,,141

335376,Re-thinking sustainability teaching,2021,"In response to personal protective equipment (PPE) shortages in the United States due to the Coronavirus Disease 2019, two models of N95 respirators were evaluated for reuse after gamma radiation sterilization. Gamma sterilization is attractive for PPE reuse because it can sterilize large quantities of material through hermetically sealed packaging, providing safety and logistic benefits. The Gamma Irradiation Facility at Sandia National Laboratories was used to irradiate N95 filtering facepiece respirators to a sterilization dose of 25 kGy(tissue). Aerosol particle filtration performance testing and electrostatic field measurements were used to determine the efficacy of the respirators after irradiation. Both respirator models exhibited statistically significant decreases in particle filtering efficiencies and electrostatic potential after irradiation. The largest decrease in capture efficiency was 40-50% and peaked near the 200 nm particle size. The key contribution of this effort is correlating the electrostatic potential change of individual filtration layer of the respirator with the decrease filtration efficiency after irradiation. This observation occurred in both variations of N95 respirator that we tested. Electrostatic potential measurement of the filtration layer is a key indicator for predicting filtration efficiency loss.","DeAngelis, Haedi E; Grillet, Anne M; Nemer, Martin B; Wasiolek, Maryla A; Hanson, Don J; Omana, Michael A; Sanchez, Andres L; Vehar, David W; Thelen, Paul M",PLoS One,,141

In this context, the special issue aims to illuminate the role that socioculture plays in mobility transitions, thereby questioning technocentric views on mobility transitions. It focuses on the following overall questions: How is future mobility portrayed and constructed in current discourses? Which role do or can different kinds of actors play in transitions toward sustainable mobility systems? How are urban mobility cultures changing? Which kinds of new practices and mobility patterns emerge? Do future mobilities re-enforce existing sociotechnical regimes and social inequities or create new ones? In the first part of this introductory article, we give an overview of existing conceptions of sociocultural dimensions of spatial mobility. Furthermore, by drawing on Pitrim Sorokin’s understanding of socioculture, we elaborate a framework that allows us to classify the different contributions to this special issue and to relate them to each other.

We evaluated how different nonpharmaceutical interventions could be used to control the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and reduce the burden on the health care system. METHODS: We used an age-structured compartmental model of COVID-19 transmission in the population of Ontario, Canada. We compared a base case with limited testing, isolation and quarantine to scenarios with the following: enhanced case finding, restrictive physical-distancing measures, or a combination of enhanced case finding and less restrictive physical distancing. Interventions were either implemented for fixed durations or dynamically cycled on and off, based on projected occupancy of intensive care unit (ICU) beds. We present medians and credible intervals from 100 replicates per scenario using a 2-year time horizon. RESULTS: We estimated that 56% (95% credible interval 42%-63%) of the Ontario population would be infected over the course of the epidemic in the base case. At the epidemic peak, we projected 107 000 (95% credible interval 60 760-149 000) cases in hospital (non-ICU) and 55 500 (95% credible interval 32 700-75 200) cases in ICU. For fixed-duration scenarios, all interventions were projected to delay and reduce the height of the epidemic peak relative to the base case, with restrictive physical distancing estimated to have the greatest effect. Longer duration interventions were more effective. Dynamic interventions were projected to reduce the proportion of the population infected at the end of the 2-year period and could reduce the median number of cases in ICU below current estimates of Ontario's ICU capacity. INTERPRETATION: Without substantial physical distancing or a combination of moderate physical distancing with enhanced case finding, we project that ICU resources would be overwhelmed. Dynamic physical distancing could maintain health-system capacity and also allow periodic psychological and economic respite for populations.","Tuite, Ashleigh R; Fisman, David N; Greer, Amy L",CMAJ,,141
340280,America gripped by crises,2020,"PURPOSE: This paper aims to investigate the Portuguese general public views regarding the criteria that should guide critical COVID-19 patients to receive medical devices (ventilators and IUC beds) during the current pandemic context. Based on rationing principles and protocols proposed in ethical and medical literature the authors explore how Portuguese general public evaluates the fairness of five allocation principles: ""prognosis"", ""severity of health condition"", ""patients age"", ""instrumental value"" (frontline healthcare professionals should be prioritized during the pandemic) and ""lottery"". DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: An online questionnaire was used to collect data from a sample of 586 Portuguese citizens. Descriptive statistics and non-parametric tests were used to define a hierarchy of prioritization criteria and to test for the association between respondents support to them and their socio-demographic and health characteristics. FINDINGS: Respondents gave top priority to prognosis when faced with absolute scarcity, followed closely by the severity of health condition, patient's age with instrumental value receiving lowest support, on average. However, when the age of the patients was confronted with survival, younger-first principle prevailed over recovery. In a pandemic context, lottery was considered the least fair allocation method. The findings suggest that respondents' opinions are aligned with those of ethicists but are partially in disagreement with the protocol suggested for Portugal. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: This study represents the first attempt to elicit public attitudes towards distributive criteria during a pandemic and, therefore, in a real context where the perception is that life and death decisions have to be made.","Pinho, Micaela",J. health organ. manag,,141

Therefore, 3CLpro has emerged as promising drug target for therapeutic treatment of infections caused by Coronaviruses. In the light of the recent major outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the continuously rising numbers of infections and casualties, there is an urgent need for quickly available drugs or vaccines to stop the current COVID-19 pandemic. Repurposing of approved drugs as 3CLpro inhibitors could dramatically shorten the period up to approval as therapeutic against SARS-CoV-2, since pharmacokinetics and toxicity is already known. Several known drugs, e.g. oxytetracycline, doxorubicin, kanamycin, cefpiramide, teniposide, proanthocyanidin and salvianolic acid B, but also not-approved active compounds from the ZINC15 library were identified as new potential inhibitors of 3CLpro by using different complementary virtual screening and docking approaches.

(authoritarian control) and ?sermon? (two-way risk communication) policies, whereas two-way risk communication demonstrates a uniquely positive effect on public value consensus;and (b) the effect of two-way risk communication on policy compliance willingness is mediated by public value consensus By enhancing public value consensus, two-way risk communication helps establish consensus between citizens and the government on ?what needs/needs not to be done? and ?what should/should not be done? to slow down the pandemic, thus coalescing efforts in a cooperative spirit;(c) nudge intervention positively moderates the effect of two-way risk communication on public value consensus, but has no effect on the authoritarian control?policy compliance willingness relationship In other words, nudge intervention is a better companion to ?sermons,? not ?sticks ? Findings of the nuanced relationship manifested the differentiated effect of authoritarian control and two-way risk communication on citizens? policy compliance willingness during a pandemic The results provide theoretical implications for scholars to unlock the ?black box? of public values and practical implications for strategies from behavioral public administration aspects to curb the ongoing COVID-19","Guan, Bin Bao Guoxian Liu Qingchuan Raymond Raduziner Gary",Administration &amp; Society,,141

They can be both pro- and anti-inflammatory and function as important mediators in various pathological conditions. However, comprehensive analysis of oxylipins still remains a challenge because of their low abundance in plasma and the dominance of structurally similar isomeric species. Herein, we describe a simple and rapid method to comprehensively analyze oxylipins in blood plasma, which utilizes solid-phase extraction in 96-well format for efficient sample cleanup. Separation and detection of more than 130 oxylipins is accomplished by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry with multiple reaction monitoring in negative-ion mode. The absolute concentrations of oxylipins in human plasma are determined using the calibration curves constructed from internal standards. Detailed methods and precautions are presented for a successful adoption of this method in analytical laboratory.","Chen, Guan-Yuan; Zhang, Qibin",Methods Mol Biol,,141

To help define this we analyzed kidney abnormalities in 26 autopsies of patients with COVID-19 by light microscopy, ultrastructural observation and immunostaining. Patients were on average 69 years (19 male and 7 female) with respiratory failure associated with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome as the cause of death. Nine of the 26 showed clinical signs of kidney injury that included increased serum creatinine and/or new-onset proteinuria. By light microscopy, diffuse proximal tubule injury with the loss of brush border, non-isometric vacuolar degeneration, and even frank necrosis was observed. Occasional hemosiderin granules and pigmented casts were identified. There were prominent erythrocyte aggregates obstructing the lumen of capillaries without platelet or fibrinoid material. Evidence of vasculitis, interstitial inflammation or hemorrhage was absent. Electron microscopic examination showed clusters of coronavirus-like particles with distinctive spikes in the tubular epithelium and podocytes. Furthermore, the receptor of SARS-CoV-2, ACE2 was found to be upregulated in patients with COVID-19, and immunostaining with SARS-CoV nucleoprotein antibody was positive in tubules. In addition to the direct virulence of SARS-CoV-2, factors contributing to acute kidney injury included systemic hypoxia, abnormal coagulation, and possible drug or hyperventilation-relevant rhabdomyolysis.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted an online experiment with 371 participants who viewed a COVID-19 screening session between a hotline agent (chatbot or human) and a user with mild or severe symptoms. RESULTS: The primary factor driving user response to screening hotlines (human or chatbot) is perceptions of the agent's ability. When ability is the same, users view chatbots no differently or more positively than human agents. The primary factor driving perceptions of ability is the user's trust in the hotline provider, with a slight negative bias against chatbots' ability. Asian individuals perceived higher ability and benevolence than did White individuals. CONCLUSIONS: Ensuring that COVID-19 screening chatbots provide high-quality service is critical but not sufficient for widespread adoption. The key is to emphasize the chatbot's ability and assure users that it delivers the same quality as human agents.","Dennis, Alan R; Kim, Antino; Rahimi, Mohammad; Ayabakan, Sezgin",J Am Med Inform Assoc,,141

METHODS: In the present cross-sectional study during March 11-16, 2020, 750 individuals in Golestan Province of Iran were included in the study using the convenience sampling and they completed the questionnaires through cyberspace. Factor scores were calculated using the confirmatory factor analysis. The effects of different factors were separately investigated using the univariate analyses, including students sample t-test, ANOVA, and simple linear regression. Finally, the effective factors were examined by the multiple regression analysis at a significant level of 0.05 and through Mplus 7 and SPSS 16. RESULTS: The participants' mean age was 33.9 ± 9.45 years; and 57.1% of them had associate and bachelor's degrees. Multiple regression indicated that the mean score of preventive behavior from COVID-19 was higher in females than males, and greater in urban dwellers than rural dwellers. Furthermore, one unit increase in the standard deviation of factor scores of self-efficacy and perceived benefits increased the scores of preventive behavior from COVID-19 by 0.22 and 0.17 units respectively. On the contrary, one unit increase in the standard deviation of factor score of perceived barriers and fatalistic beliefs decreased the scores of the preventive behavior from COVID-19 by 0.36 and 0.19 units respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Results of the present study indicated that female gender, perceived barriers, perceived self-efficacy, fatalistic beliefs, perceived interests, and living in city had the greatest preventive behaviors from COVID-19 respectively.

Depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were assessed by the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) and PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5), respectively. RESULTS: The age-standardized prevalence of depression, anxiety and PTSD was 15.5%, 12.7% and 5.2%, respectively. Frontline workers had higher prevalence estimates than non-frontline workers (depression: 18.2% vs. 13.9%; anxiety: 14.7% vs. 11.6%; PTSD: 6.1% vs. 4.6%). Subgroups who were nurses, were married or had dependent children reported higher prevalence of depression, anxiety and PTSD. Despite of the large variations, the prevalence of mental disorders was lowest in East China, followed by Middle China, and highest in West China. CONCLUSION: Healthcare workers faced enormous stress not only from the direct risk presented by the COVID-19 outbreak, but also from the profound changes in their professional practice. Prevalence of adverse psychological outcomes has a significant association with geographically distribution of health resources and regional economic level. Sufficient medical resource may be a protective factor to mental health condition of healthcare personnel when such a public health emergency happened.","Yang, Xiaoguang; Chen, Danni; Chen, Yuntao; Wang, Nan; Lyv, Chao; Li, Yao; Jie, Junqin; Zhou, Taiqi; Li, Yongbin; Zhou, Ping",Int. j. health plann. manage,,141

X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of NRs revealed the hexagonal wurtzite structure for all composites with an average coherence length of about 40-60 nm. A scanning electron microscopy (SEM) study confirmed the presence of transparent and wrinkled, dense GO nanosheets among flower-like ZnO nanorods, depending on the GO amounts used in preparation. Raman spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) absorption spectroscopy, and photoluminescence (PL) measurements revealed the impact of GO concentration on the optical and luminescence properties of ZnO NRs/GO nanocomposites. The energy band gap of the ZnO nanorods was independent of GO concentration. Photoluminescence spectra of nanocomposites showed a significant decrease in the intensities in the visible light range and red shifted suggesting a charge transfer process. The nanocomposites' chromaticity coordinates for CIE 1931 color space were estimated to be (0.33, 0.34), close to pure white ones.

To examine the relationships between cognitive function and the hippocampal subfields (HSs) in first-episode never-treated (FENT) schizophrenia patients, the HSs were segmented in 39 FENT patients and 30 healthy controls using a state-of the-art automated algorithm. We found no significant differences in any HSs between the patients and controls. However, multivariate regression analysis showed that the left cornu ammonis 1 (CA1), left hippocampal tail, left presubiculum, and right molecular layer contributed 40% to the variance of the PANSS negative symptom score. After adjusting for sex, age, education, and intracranial volume, the partial correlation analysis showed that the volumes of left CA1, CA3, CA4, molecular layer, granule cell layer and both left and right subiculum were negatively correlated with the MATRICS consensus cognitive battery (MCCB) Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (HVLT).

348096,The digital transformation - all good?,2020,"CONTEXT: The ways in which the COVID-19 pandemic has affected abortion providers and abortion care, and the strategies clinics are adopting to navigate the pandemic, have not been well documented. METHODS: In April-May 2020, representatives from 103 independent abortion clinics (i.e., those not affiliated with Planned Parenthood) completed a survey that included close-ended questions about how the pandemic, the public health response, and designations of abortion as a nonessential service had affected their clinic, as well as open-ended questions about the pandemic's impact. Analyses were primarily descriptive but included an exploration of regional variation. RESULTS: All U.S. regions were represented in the sample. At 51% of clinics, clinicians or staff had been unable to work because of the pandemic or public health responses. Temporary closures were more common among clinics in the South (35%) and Midwest (21%) than in the Northeast and West (5% each). More than half of clinics had canceled or postponed nonabortion services (e.g., general gynecologic care); cancelation or postponement of abortion services was less common (25-38%, depending on type) and again especially prevalent in the South and Midwest. Providers reported the pandemic had had numerous effects on their clinics, including disrupting their workforce, clinic flow and work practices; increasing expenses; and reducing revenues. State laws (including designations of abortion as nonessential) had exacerbated these difficulties. CONCLUSIONS: Although independent abortion clinics have faced considerable challenges from the pandemic, most continued to provide abortion care. Despite this resiliency, additional support may be needed to ensure sustainability of these clinics.","Roberts, Sarah C M; Schroeder, Rosalyn; Joffe, Carole",Perspect. sex. reprod. health,,141

La literatura mundial describe mayor incidencia de parto prematuro y cesáreas en pacientes infectadas por COVID-19 principalmente de origen iatrogénico, sin embargo, existen escasos datos del pronóstico del embarazo al decidir diferir el parto hasta después del período infeccioso del virus. Este trabajo reporta un grupo de embarazadas diagnosticadas con COVID-19 en tercer trimestre donde se decidió no interrumpir el embarazo y diferir su parto hasta recuperación de la patología. MÉTODOS: Estudio observacional retrospectivo que analiza resultados materno-perinatales en 9 casos de mujeres infectadas por COVID, diagnosticadas posterior a las 33 semanas y cuyo parto se verificó después de recuperadas del COVID. RESULTADOS: Se observó un 77% de pacientes sintomáticas, 77% requirieron hospitalización, 33% por COVID, todas ingresaron a unidad de paciente crítico, sólo una requirió ventilación mecánica no invasiva. Dos cursaron con cetoacidosis normo-glicémica y dos con neumonía por COVID-19. Un 88% resultó en parto de término, sólo una paciente tuvo parto prematuro de causa obstétrica. La vía de parto fue un 67% vaginal y 33% por cesárea, todas por indicación obstétrica. La latencia al parto promedio fue de 17.3 días. Los puntajes de Apgar fueron todos mayor a 7 al minuto y 5 minutos. CONCLUSIÓN: Los resultados de esta serie sugieren que, en casos seleccionados, los partos posteriores al período infeccioso del COVID se asocian a buenos resultados materno-perinatales, sin embargo, resulta importante aumentar la casuística.","Vega Rojas, Denise; Carreño Manríquez, Leonardo; Díaz Echeverría, Claudia",Rev. chil. obstet. ginecol.

352780,Critical terms in futures studies,2020,"SARS-CoV-2 currently lacks effective first-line drug treatment. We present promising data from in silico docking studies of new Methisazone compounds (modified with calcium, Ca; iron, Fe; magnesium, Mg; manganese, Mn; or zinc, Zn) designed to bind more strongly to key proteins involved in replication of SARS-CoV-2. In this in silico molecular docking study, we investigated the inhibiting role of Methisazone and the modified drugs against SARS-CoV-2 proteins: ribonucleic acid (RNA)-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), spike protein, papain-like protease (PlPr), and main protease (MPro). We found that the highest binding interactions were found with the spike protein (6VYB), with the highest overall binding being observed with Mn-bound Methisazone at -8.3 kcal/mol, followed by Zn and Ca at -8.0 kcal/mol, and Fe and Mg at -7.9 kcal/mol. We also found that the metal-modified Methisazone had higher affinity for PlPr and MPro. In addition, we identified multiple binding pockets that could be singly or multiply occupied on all proteins tested. The best binding energy was with Mn-Methisazone versus spike protein, and the largest cumulative increases in binding energies were found with PlPr. We suggest that further studies are warranted to identify whether these compounds may be effective for treatment and/or prophylaxis.","Abdelaal Ahmed Mahmoud M Alkhatip, Ahmed; Georgakis, Michail; Montero Valenzuela, Lucio R; Hamza, Mohamed; Farag, Ehab; Hodgkinson, Jaqui; Hosny, Hisham; Kamal, Ahmed M; Wagih, Mohamed; Naguib, Amr; Yassin, Hany; Algameel, Haytham; Elayashy, Mohamed; Abdelhaq, Mohamed; Younis, Mohamed I; Mohamed, Hassan; Abdulshafi, Mohammed; Elramely, Mohamed A",Int. j. mol. sci.

354309,Executive power in emergencies: Where is the accountability?,2020,"The natural history of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 is extremely variable, ranging from asymptomatic or mild infection, mainly in children, to multi-organ failure, eventually fatal, mainly in the eldest. We propose here the first model explaining how the outcome of first, crucial 10-15 days after infection, depends on the balance between the cumulative dose of viral exposure and the efficacy of the local innate immune response (natural IgA and IgM antibodies, mannose-binding lectin). If SARS-CoV-2 runs the blockade of this innate immunity and spreads from the upper airways to the alveoli in the early phases of the infections, it can replicate with no local resistance, causing pneumonia and releasing high amounts of antigens. The delayed and strong adaptive immune response (high-affinity IgM and IgG antibodies) that follows, causes severe inflammation and triggers mediator cascades (complement, coagulation, and cytokine storm), leading to complications often requiring intensive therapy and being, in some patients, fatal. Low-moderate physical activity can still be recommended. However, extreme physical activity and oral breathing with hyperventilation during the incubation days and early stages of COVID-19 facilitates re-inhalation and early direct penetration of high numbers of own virus particles in the lower airways and the alveoli, without impacting on the airway's mucosae covered by neutralizing antibodies (""viral auto-inhalation"" phenomenon). This allows the virus to bypass the efficient immune barrier of the upper airway mucosa in already infected, young, and otherwise healthy athletes. In conclusion, whether the virus or the adaptive immune response reaches the lungs first is a crucial factor deciding the fate of the patient. This ""quantitative and time-/sequence-dependent"" model has several implications for prevention, diagnosis, and therapy of COVID-19 at all ages.","Matricardi, Paolo Maria; Dal Negro, Roberto Walter; Nisini, Roberto",Pediatr Allergy Immunol,,141
354467,Spatial heterogeneity of housing space consumption in urban China: Locals vs. inter-and intra-provincial migrants,2020,"OBJECTIVES: To determine if a specific intervention reduces the composite of progression of patients with COVID-19-related disease to organ failure or death as measured by time to incidence of any one of the following: death, invasive mechanical ventilation, ECMO, cardiovascular organ support (inotropes or balloon pump), or renal failure (estimated Cockcroft Gault creatinine clearance <15ml/min). TRIAL DESIGN: Randomised, parallel arm, open-label, adaptive platform Phase 2/3 trial of potential disease modifying therapies in patients with late stage 1/stage 2 COVID-19-related disease, with a diagnosis based either on a positive assay or high suspicion of COVID-19 infection by clinical, laboratory and radiological assessment. PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged 18 and over, with a clinical picture strongly suggestive of COVID-19-related disease (with/without a positive COVID-19 test) AND a risk count (as defined below) >3 OR &#8805;3 if risk count includes ""Radiographic severity score >3"". A risk count is calculated by the following features on admission (1 point for each): radiographic severity score >3, male gender, non-white ethnicity, diabetes, hypertension, neutrophils >8.0 x109/L, age >40 years and CRP >40 mg/L. Patients should be considered an appropriate subject for intervention with immunomodulatory or other disease modifying agents in the opinion of the investigator and are able to swallow capsules or tablets. The complete inclusion and exclusion criteria as detailed in the Additional file 1 should be fulfilled. Drug specific inclusion and exclusion criteria will also be applied to the active arms. Patients will be enrolled prior to the need for invasive mechanical ventilation, cardiac or renal support. Participants will be recruited across multiple centres in the UK including initially at Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and St George's University NHS Foundation Trust. Other centres will be approached internationally in view of the evolving pandemic. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: There is increasing evidence of the role of immunomodulation in altering the course of COVID-19. Additionally, various groups have demonstrated the presence of pulmonary shunting in patients with COVID-19 as well as other cardiovascular complications. TACTIC-E will assess the efficacy of the novel immunomodulatory agent EDP1815 versus the approved cardio-pulmonary drugs, Dapagliflozin in combination with Ambrisentan versus the prevailing standard of care. EDP1815 will be given as 2 capsules twice daily (1.6 x 1011 cells) for up to 7 days with the option to extend up to 14 days at the discretion of the principal investigator or their delegate, if the patient is felt to be clinically responding to treatment, is tolerating treatment, and is judged to be likely to benefit from a longer treatment course. Ambrisentan 5mg and Dapagliflozin 10mg will be given in combination once daily orally for up to maximum of 14 days. Patients will be randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio across treatments. Each active arm will be compared with standard of care alone. Additional arms may be added as the trial progresses. No comparisons will be made between active arms in this platform trial. MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary outcome is the incidence (from baseline up to Day 14) to the occurrence of the any one of the following events: death, invasive mechanical ventilation, extra corporeal membrane oxygenation, cardiovascular organ support (inotropes or balloon pump), or renal failure (estimated Cockcroft Gault creatinine clearance <15ml/min). RANDOMISATION: Eligible patients will be randomised using a central web-based randomisation service (Sealed Envelope) in a 1:1:1 ratio, stratified by site to one of the treatment arms or standard of care. BLINDING (MASKING): This is an open-label trial. Data analysis will not be blinded. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): There is no fixed sample size for this study. There will be an early biomarker-based futility analysis performed at a point during the study. If this biomarker futility analysis is not conclusive, then a second futility analysis based on clinical endpoints will be performed after approximately 125 patients have been recruited per arm. Provisionally, further analyses of clinical endpoints will be performed after 229 patients per active arm and later 469 patients per arm have been recruited. Further additional analyses may be triggered by the independent data monitoring committee. TRIAL STATUS: TACTIC-E Protocol version number 1.0 date May 27th, 2020. Recruitment starts on the 3rd of July 2020. The end trial date will be 18 months after the last patient's last visit and cannot be accurately predicted at this time.

In turn, this will improve planning for future incidents. While this is being undertaken at a national level by Public Health England, more specific information as it relates to psychiatric care is important in understanding the neuropsychiatric, psychological and social effects of the pandemic. The management of patients with COVID-19 presents a unique challenge in inpatient psychiatry settings both in terms of diagnosis and treatment. This is perhaps greater still in forensic settings due to the increased risk of violence and aggression. This audit aimed to firstly assess the consistency of local practice to national guidance from Public Health England. Secondly, it aimed to describe the clinical management of suspected and confirmed cases of COVID-19 in this high security forensic hospital and how readily broad, national guidance can be implemented in this unique setting. We present an audit with three cycles, one from each wave of COVID-19 in England during 2020.MethodThis was a retrospective audit in a high secure forensic psychiatry hospital in the United Kingdom, into the investigation and management of suspected and confirmed cases of COVID-19 compared to national guidelines from Public Health England. It includes three cycles, one undertaken in each national wave of COVID-19 in England in 2020.ResultTen patients have been included in cycle 1, 12 in cycle 2 and 21 in cycle 3 as those where COVID-19 was a considered diagnosis. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in one patient in cycle 1 and 12 patients in cycle 3. All patients recovered, most of whom remained on-site with supportive care in self-isolation on a dedicated ward for positive cases. Three patients required additional treated with oral antibiotics and dexamethasone, one of whom required admission to the local general medical hospital for continuous supplemental oxygen.ConclusionThis is the first study to describe the management of the novel COVID-19 pandemic in a high security forensic psychiatry hospital and how readily national guidance can be implemented in this unique setting. Hospital practice at identifying suspected cases and the management of confirmed cases of COVID-19 was shown to be consistent with national guidance. It also allowed for clinicians to exercise their judgement about testing for atypical cases and for repeat testing where appropriate.","Carthy, Elliott Sengupta Samrat",BJPsych Open,,141

In this retrospective observational study we are evaluating the demographic characteristics, the comorbidities of the patients, the clinical signs of the infection, the signs of clinical severity, the biological assessment at admission, the treatment, the outcomes and the deaths of 133 patients with COVID-19, of which 25 (19,4%) had diabetes. In the compared COVID-19 patients, with and without diabetes, the patients with diabetes were older, had higher blood pressure and more cardio-vascular diseases. Severe forms were more present in diabetic patients (56% versus 27.1%). Weight loss was higher in diabetic patients (6kg versus 3kg). Biologically, diabetic patients had higher levels of C-reactive protein (28 versus 5.8mg/l), procalcitonin (0.28 versus 0,13ng/l), ferritin (501 versus 140ng/ml), lactic dehydrogenase (268 versus 226IU/l) and of D. dimer (665 versus 444µg/l). Diabetic patients required more oxygen therapy (60% versus 26.9%), more mechanical ventilation (20% versus 8.3%) and more frequent admission to the intensive care unit (60% versus 27.8%). They presented more thromboembolic complications (12% versus 9%) but there were not significant differences in the other outcomes and in death rates. The excess of morbidity and mortality due to diabetes was still not fully clarified; the role of demographic factors, the interaction of mediations with ACE-2 receptors and the role of co-morbidities will all need to be studied in order to identify the patient at risk profile, i.e. who can develop severe forms of the diseases and more outcomes. The early identification of a possible hyper inflammation could be very valuable. More attention should be paid to patients with COVID-19 with diabetes because they are at a high risk of complications.","Elamari, Saloua; Motaib, Imane; Zbiri, Saad; Elaidaoui, Karim; Chadli, Asmaa; Elkettani, Chafik",Pan Afr Med J,,141

The virus still spreads globally through human-to-human transmission. Nevertheless, there are no specific treatments clinically approved. This study aimed to compare antiviral activity of gemcitabine and its analogue 2'-fluoro-2'-deoxycytidine (2FdC) against SARS-CoV-2 as well as cytotoxicity in vitro. Fluorescent image-based antiviral assays revealed that gemcitabine was highly potent, with a 50% effective concentration (EC50) of 1.2 µM, more active than the well-known nucleoside monophosphate remdesivir (EC50 = 35.4 µM). In contrast, 2FdC was marginally active (EC50 = 175.2 µM). For all three compounds, the 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC50) values were over 300 µM toward Vero CCL-81 cells. Western blot and quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction analyses verified that gemcitabine blocked viral protein expression in virus-infected cells, not only Vero CCL-81 cells but also Calu-3 human lung epithelial cells in a dose-dependent manner. It was found that gemcitabine has a synergistic effect when combined with remdesivir. This report suggests that the difluoro group of gemcitabine is critical for the antiviral activity and that its combination with other evaluated antiviral drugs, such as remdesivir, could be a desirable option to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Jang, Yejin; Shin, Jin Soo; Lee, Myoung Kyu; Jung, Eunhye; An, Timothy; Kim, Uk-Il; Kim, Kyungjin; Kim, Meehyein",Int. j. mol. sci.

Las condiciones propias de la enfermedad han hecho que los pacientes desarrollen insomnio, lo que puede empeorar su estado de salud y alterar su sistema inmunológico. Para las personas sanas en cuarentena los cambios en el estilo de vida, el miedo a contraer la enfermedad, la edad joven, el sexo femenino, los antecedentes de enfermedades mentales y una menor capacidad de afrontamiento al estrés parecen ser factores de riesgo para el insomnio.

357167,From China’s Reform to the World’s Reform,2020,"Amid controversial reports that COVID-19 can be treated with a combination of the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and the antibiotic azithromycin (AZI), a clinical trial (ONCOCOVID, NCT04341207) was launched at Gustave Roussy Cancer Campus to investigate the utility of this combination therapy in cancer patients. In this preclinical study, we investigated whether the combination of HCQ+AZI would be compatible with the therapeutic induction of anticancer immune responses. For this, we used doses of HCQ and AZI that affect whole-body physiology (as indicated by a partial blockade in cardiac and hepatic autophagic flux for HCQ and a reduction in body weight for AZI), showing that their combined administration did not interfere with tumor growth control induced by the immunogenic cell death inducer oxaliplatin. Moreover, the HCQ+AZI combination did not affect the capacity of a curative regimen (cisplatin + crizotinib + PD-1 blockade) to eradicate established orthotopic lung cancers in mice. In conclusion, it appears that HCQ+AZI does not interfere with the therapeutic induction of therapeutic anticancer immune responses.","Liu, Peng; Zhao, Liwei; Ferrere, Gladys; Alves-Costa-Silva, Carolina; Ly, Pierre; Wu, Qi; Tian, Ai-Ling; Derosa, Lisa; Zitvogel, Laurence; Kepp, Oliver; Kroemer, Guido",Oncoimmunology,,141

359796,To Cope with a New Coronavirus Pandemic: How Life May Be Changed Forever,2020,"BACKGROUND: Advancing age is a major risk factor for developing and dying from bloodstream infections (BSI). However, there is a paucity of population-based studies investigating the epidemiology of BSI in older persons. OBJECTIVE: To define the incidence, clinical determinants, and risk factors for death among those aged 65 years and older with BSI. METHODS: Population-based surveillance was conducted in the western interior of British Columbia, Canada, between April 1, 2010 and March 31, 2020. Chart reviews were conducted for clinical details and all cause case-fatality was established at 30-days follow-up. RESULTS: A total of 1854 incident BSI were identified among 1657 individuals aged 65 and older for an annual incidence of 533.9 per 100,000 population; the incidence for those aged 65-74, 75-84, and &#8805;85 years was 375.3, 678.9, and 1046.6 per 100,000 population, respectively. Males were at significantly increased risk as compared to females (incidence rate ratio, IRR 1.44; 95% confidence interval, CI, 1.32-1.59; p<0.0001). The crude annual incidence increased by 50% during the study. However, this was related to shift in population demographics with no increase evident following age- and sex-standardization. Older patients were more likely to have healthcare-associated infections and genitourinary sources and less likely to have bone/joint or soft tissue infections. The proportion of patients with underlying congestive heart failure, stroke, and dementia increased, whereas diabetes and liver disease decreased with older age. The overall 30-day all cause case-fatality rate was 22.0% (364/1657). After adjustment for clinical focus, onset of infection, etiology, and co-morbidity in a logistic model, those aged 75-84 years (odds ratio, OR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.25-2.21) and &#8805; 85 years (OR, 1.98; 95% CI, 1.41-2.77) were at significantly increased risk for death as compared to those aged 65-74 years. CONCLUSION: Bloodstream infection is common in older persons and is a major cause of death. Countries with aging populations worldwide should expect an increase burden associated with BSI in the coming years.","Laupland, Kevin B; Pasquill, Kelsey; Steele, Lisa; Parfitt, Elizabeth C",BMC Geriatr,,141

363931,A meta‐review of 10 years of green human resource management: is Green HRM headed towards a roadblock or a revitalisation?: Journal of the Institue of Personnel Management Australia,2021,"Importance: This study assesses the role of telehealth in the delivery of care at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Objectives: To document patterns and costs of ambulatory care in the US before and during the initial stage of the pandemic and to assess how patient, practitioner, community, and COVID-19-related factors are associated with telehealth adoption. Design, Setting, and Participants: This is a cohort study of working-age persons continuously enrolled in private health plans from March 2019 through June 2020. The comparison periods were March to June in 2019 and 2020. Claims data files were provided by Blue Health Intelligence, an independent licensee of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association. Data analysis was performed from June to October 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: Ambulatory encounters (in-person and telehealth) and allowed charges, stratified by characteristics derived from enrollment files, practitioner claims, and community characteristics linked to the enrollee's zip code. Results: A total of 36â¯568â¯010 individuals (mean [SD] age, 35.71 [18.77] years; 18â¯466â¯557 female individuals [50.5%]) were included in the analysis. In-person contacts decreased by 37% (from 1.63 to 1.02 contacts per enrollee) from 2019 to 2020. During 2020, telehealth visits (0.32 visit per person) accounted for 23.6% of all interactions compared with 0.3% of contacts in 2019. When these virtual contacts were added, the overall COVID-19 era patient and practitioner visit rate was 18% lower than that in 2019 (1.34 vs 1.64 visits per person). Behavioral health encounters were far more likely than medical contacts to take place virtually (46.1% vs 22.1%). COVID-19 prevalence in an area was associated with higher use of telehealth; patients from areas within the top quintile of COVID-19 prevalence during the week of their encounter were 1.34 times more likely to have a telehealth visit compared with those in the lowest quintile (the reference category). Persons living in areas with limited social resources were less likely to use telehealth (most vs least socially advantaged neighborhoods, 27.4% vs 19.9% usage rates). Per enrollee medical care costs decreased by 15% between 2019 and 2020 (from $358.32 to $306.04 per person per month). During 2020, those with 1 or more COVID-19-related service (1â¯470â¯721 members) had more than 3 times the medical costs ($1701 vs $544 per member per month) than those without COVID-19-related services. Persons with 1 or more telehealth visits in 2020 had considerably higher costs than persons having only in-person ambulatory contacts ($2214.10 vs $1337.78 for the COVID-19-related subgroup and $735.87 vs $456.41 for the non-COVID-19 subgroup). Conclusions and Relevance: This study of a large cohort of patients enrolled in US health plans documented patterns of care at the onset of COVID-19. The findings are relevant to policy makers, payers, and practitioners as they manage the use of telehealth during the pandemic and afterward.","Weiner, Jonathan P; Bandeian, Stephen; Hatef, Elham; Lans, Daniel; Liu, Angela; Lemke, Klaus W",JAMA Netw Open,,141

364405,Food and Agriculture,2020,"OBJECTIVE: The trace element selenium (Se) is needed for regular biosynthesis of selenoproteins, which contribute to antioxidative defense systems and affect redox-regulated signaling. Elevated Se intake and selenoprotein expression levels have been associated with impaired hydrogen peroxide-dependent signaling by insulin, leading to hyperglycemia and insulin resistance. The relation of low Se intake with glucose status and carbohydrate metabolism is poorly known. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A cross sectional analysis among healthy subjects residing in two Chinese counties with different habitual Se intakes was conducted. Fasted glucose levels were related to Se concentrations of 5686 adults by linear regression analysis with Se, body mass index, age, thyroid status, insulin and sex as independent variables. RESULTS: Serum Se correlated strongly and positively with glucose in the Se-deficient population. There was no strong relationship of Se and glucose in the non-deficient population. Overt hypoglycemia (serum glucose < 2.8 mM) was observed in 19.2% of this random sample of subjects in the Se-deficient and in 1.4% of the moderately supplied population, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: An adequate Se supply constitutes an important factor for glucose homeostasis in human subjects. The interaction between Se status and glucose control is not limited to hyperglycemia, but apparently extends to hypoglycemia risk in Se deficiency. This newly identified relationship may be of relevance for the course of severe disease including major trauma, sepsis and COVID-19, where Se deficiency has been associated with mortality risk.","Wang, Yue; Rijntjes, Eddy; Wu, Qian; Lv, Hongjun; Gao, Chuqi; Shi, Bingyin; Schomburg, Lutz",Redox Biol,,141

In this process protoporphyrin (PpIX) is released. METHODS: The decrease in the hemoglobin levels observed in patients with Covid-19 is frequently accompanied by an increase in PpIX levels. This evidence was confirmed by the quantification of PpIX by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). PpIX emission is observed in its two characteristic bands at approximately 635 nm and 705 nm. RESULTS: This paper searches to understand the role of heme and PpIX inside the cells. Perspectives on the use of PpIX fluorescence as a sensor to monitor the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the tissue, blood, urine, or feces to map the evolution and severity of the disease or to monitor the response of the Covid-19 treatment modalities were described. CONCLUSION: Fluorescence spectroscopy could be adopted as an excellent diagnostic technique for Covid-19, of low cost and high sensitivity. This method can potentially be used as a marker to monitor the response to the treatments. Photodynamic and sonodynamic therapies using the endogenous PpIX increased in the acute phase of the disease, could be employed for Covid-19 treatment.","Courrol, Lilia Coronato; de Oliveira Silva, Flávia Rodrigues; Masilamani, Valdivel",Photodiagnosis Photodyn Ther,,141

Here we describe a renal-transplant recipient who developed recurrent, symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection 7 months after primary infection. To elucidate the immunological mechanisms responsible for reinfection, we performed longitudinal profiling of cellular and humoral responses during both primary and recurrent SARS-CoV-2 infection. We found that the patient responded to the primary infection with transient, poor-quality adaptive immune responses that was further compromised by intervening treatment for acute rejection of the renal allograft prior to reinfection. Importantly, we identified the development of neutralizing antibodies and humoral memory responses prior to SARS-CoV-2 reinfection. However, these neutralizing antibodies failed to confer protection against reinfection, suggesting that additional factors are required for efficient prevention of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection. Further, we found no evidence supporting viral evasion of primary adaptive immune responses, suggesting that susceptibility to reinfection may be determined by host factors rather than pathogen adaptation.","Klein, J.; Brito, A.; Trubin, P.; Lu, P.; Wong, P.; Alpert, T.; Pena-Hernandez, M.; Haynes, W.; Kamath, K.; Liu, F.; Vogels, C.; Fauver, J.; Lucas, C.; Oh, J.

Grantham (eds.), Insights on International Volunteering: Perspectives from the Global South",2020,"A comprehensive review of the neurological disorders reported during the current COVID-19 pandemic demonstrates that infection with SARS-CoV-2 affects the central nervous system (CNS), the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and the muscle. CNS manifestations include: headache and decreased responsiveness considered initial indicators of potential neurological involvement; anosmia, hyposmia, hypogeusia, and dysgeusia are frequent early symptoms of coronavirus infection. Respiratory failure, the lethal manifestation of COVID-19, responsible for 264,679 deaths worldwide, is probably neurogenic in origin and may result from the viral invasion of cranial nerve I, progressing into rhinencephalon and brainstem respiratory centers. Cerebrovascular disease, in particular large-vessel ischemic strokes, and less frequently cerebral venous thrombosis, intracerebral hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage, usually occur as part of a thrombotic state induced by viral attachment to ACE2 receptors in endothelium causing widespread endotheliitis, coagulopathy, arterial and venous thromboses. Acute hemorrhagic necrotizing encephalopathy is associated to the cytokine storm. A frontal hypoperfusion syndrome has been identified. There are isolated reports of seizures, encephalopathy, meningitis, encephalitis, and myelitis. The neurological diseases affecting the PNS and muscle in COVID-19 are less frequent and include Guillain-Barré syndrome; Miller Fisher syndrome; polyneuritis cranialis; and rare instances of viral myopathy with rhabdomyolysis. The main conclusion of this review is the pressing need to define the neurology of COVID-19, its frequency, manifestations, neuropathology and pathogenesis. On behalf of the World Federation of Neurology we invite national and regional neurological associations to create local databases to report cases with neurological manifestations observed during the on-going pandemic. International neuroepidemiological collaboration may help define the natural history of this worldwide problem.","Román, Gustavo C; Spencer, Peter S; Reis, Jacques; Buguet, Alain; Faris, Mostafa El Alaoui; Katrak, Sarosh M; Láinez, Miguel; Medina, Marco Tulio; Meshram, Chandrashekhar; Mizusawa, Hidehiro; Öztürk, Serefnur; Wasay, Mohammad",J Neurol Sci,,141

A major question is how to evaluate the quality of such thematic clusters. Here we create a corpus of microblog clusters from three different domains and time windows and define the task of evaluating thematic coherence. We provide annotation guidelines and human annotations of thematic coherence by journalist experts. We subsequently investigate the efficacy of different automated evaluation metrics for the task. We consider a range of metrics including surface level metrics, ones for topic model coherence and text generation metrics (TGMs). While surface level metrics perform well, outperforming topic coherence metrics, they are not as consistent as TGMs. TGMs are more reliable than all other metrics considered for capturing thematic coherence in microblog clusters due to being less sensitive to the effect of time windows.","Bilal, Iman Munire; Wang, Bo; Liakata, Maria; Procter, Rob; Tsakalidis, Adam",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.15971v1.pdf,141

367739,Cross-regional drivers for CCUS deployment,2020,"Antigen testing for SARS-CoV-2 (AGT) is generally considered inferior to RT-PCR testing in terms of sensitivity. However, little is known about the infectiousness of RT-PCR positive patients who pass undetected by AGT. In a screening setting for mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic patients with high COVID-19 prevalence (30-40%), 1141 patients were tested using one of five AGTs and RT-PCR. Where the results differed, virus viability in the samples was tested on cell culture (CV-1 cells). The test battery included AGTs by JOYSBIO, Assure Tech, SD Biosensor, VivaChek Biotech and NDFOS. Sensitivities of the ATGs compared to RT-PCR ranged from 42% to 76%. The best test yielded a 76% sensitivity, 97% specificity, 92% positive, and 89% negative predictive values, respectively. However, in the best performing ATG tests, almost 90% of samples with ""false negative"" AGT results contained no viable virus. Corrected on the virus viability, sensitivities grew to 81-97% and, with one exception, the tests yielded high specificities >96%. Performance characteristics of the best test after adjustment were 96% sensitivity, 97% specificity, 92% positive, and 99% negative predictive values (high prevalence population). We, therefore, believe that virus viability should be considered when assessing the AGT performance. Also, our results indicate that a well-performing antigen test could in a high-prevalence setting serve as an excellent tool for identifying patients shedding viable virus. We also propose that the high proportion of RT-PCR-positive samples containing no viable virus in the group of ""false negatives"" of the antigen test should be further investigated with the aim of possibly preventing needless isolation of such patients.","Homza, Miroslav; Zelena, Hana; Janosek, Jaroslav; Tomaskova, Hana; Jezo, Eduard; Kloudova, Alena; Mrazek, Jakub; Svagera, Zdenek; Prymula, Roman",Viruses,,141

One area particularly affected is our diets, with food supply chain disruptions, media coverage of food safety issues and restaurant closures all influencing consumer dietary behaviour. Given this situation, we pose a timely question - what is the impact of the current pandemic on longer-term meat consumption patterns? This issue is pertinent given accumulating evidence that overconsumption of meat, particularly red meat, is associated with negative environmental and health outcomes. Here, we discuss how the current pandemic has already begun to shift public awareness of illnesses linked to animals and has resulted in short-term changes in patterns of meat consumption. Past zoonotic outbreaks, such as SARS and swine flu, are also referred to, and we find that these led to similar short-term reductions in meat intake, a shift in the type of meat chosen and longer-lasting impacts on consumer perceptions of the health risks associated with meat. We conclude that, if immediate changes in eating patterns as a result of COVID-19 are retained in the longer term, one possible opportunity to emerge from the current pandemic may be a shift away from overconsumption of meat, leading to potential health and environmental benefits in the longer term.","Attwood, Sophie; Hajat, Cother",Public Health Nutr,,141
372189,Probabilistic social learning improves the public’s judgments of news veracity,2021,"BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) rapidly shifted psychosocial services to telepsychology, including psychosocial oncology (PSO) practices. PSO providers work with patients undergoing treatment, experiencing treatment delays and/or immuno-suppression in the context of a global pandemic. There is evidence to support the acceptability of telepsychology among cancer patients and an emerging need for data to inform the design and provision of telepsychology PSO care during the pandemic and beyond. RESEARCH OBJECTIVES: This study examined engagement in telepsychology PSO care at an outpatient community cancer center. METHODS: The current study analyzed practice data from a PSO department from March 2020 through September 2020. The sample included 354 patients (91 established; 263 newly referred). Descriptive, correlational, and comparative analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Among established patients, 93% continued with telepsychology PSO care after the pandemic and 94% completed at least one telepsychology appointment. Among newly referred patients, 50.6% scheduled a telepsychology appointment, consistent with the scheduling rate for the proceeding calendar year (50%). Across patients scheduling telepsychology PSO appointments (N = 194), 68 initially engaged in phone-based services with 20 converting to video, for a total of 127 (76.5%) patients utilizing video-based PSO services. Common reasons for phone-based services included 'patient preference' (N = 14), 'lack of access' (N = 9), and 'technology barriers' (N = 8). During this timeframe, 18% had at least one no-show, which is significantly less than the preceding year (23%). Phone-based patients were significantly older (p =.007). A greater proportion of males engaged in phone-based services compared to females (p = .006). CONCLUSIONS: Telepsychology PSO engages new and existing patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. There may be an increased demand for services and increased utilization in the context of the pandemic and the availability of telepsychology. There are disparities and access issues that should be considered and addressed.","Myers Virtue, Shannon; Howrey, Hillary L; Duffy, Nicole M; Wallace, Meaghan",J Psychosoc Oncol,,141

We aimed to develop a clinical model to predict the outcome of patients with severe COVID-19 infection early. METHODS: Demographic, clinical and first laboratory findings after admission of 183 patients with severe COVID-19 infection (115 survivors and 68 non-survivors from the Sino-French New City Branch of Tongji Hospital, Wuhan) were used to develop the predictive models. Machine learning approaches were used to select the features and predict the patients' outcomes. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was applied to compare the models' performance. A total of 64 with severe COVID-19 infection from the Optical Valley Branch of Tongji Hospital, Wuhan, were used to externally validate the final predictive model. RESULTS: The baseline characteristics and laboratory tests were significantly different between the survivors and non-survivors. Four variables (age, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level, lymphocyte count and d-dimer level) were selected by all five models. Given the similar performance among the models, the logistic regression model was selected as the final predictive model because of its simplicity and interpretability. The AUROCs of the external validation sets were 0.881. The sensitivity and specificity were 0.839 and 0.794 for the validation set, when using a probability of death of 50% as the cutoff. Risk score based on the selected variables can be used to assess the mortality risk. The predictive model is available at [https://phenomics.fudan.edu.cn/risk_scores/].

376366,Sustainable business models in hybrids: a conceptual framework for community pharmacies' business owners,2020,"We present a brief history of the immune response and show that Metchnikoff's theory of inflammation and phagocytotic defense was largely ignored in the 20th century. For decades, the immune response was believed to be triggered centrally, until Lafferty and Cunningham proposed the initiating signal came from the tissues. This shift opened the way for Janeway's pattern recognition receptor theory, and Matzinger's danger model. All models failed to appreciate that without inflammation, there can be no immune response. The situation changed in the 1990s when cytokine biology was rapidly advancing, and the immune system's role expanded from host defense, to the maintenance of host health. An inflammatory environment, produced by immune cells themselves, was now recognized as mandatory for their attack, removal and repair functions after an infection or injury. We explore the cellular programs of the immune response, and the role played by cytokines and other mediators to tailor the right response, at the right time. Normally, the immune response is robust, self-limiting and restorative. However, when the antigen load or trauma exceeds the body's internal tolerances, as witnessed in some COVID-19 patients, excessive inflammation can lead to increased sympathetic outflows, cardiac dysfunction, coagulopathy, endothelial and metabolic dysfunction, multiple organ failure and death. Currently, there are few drug therapies to reduce excessive inflammation and immune dysfunction. We have been developing an intravenous (IV) fluid therapy comprising adenosine, lidocaine and Mg2+ (ALM) that confers a survival advantage by preventing excessive inflammation initiated by sepsis, endotoxemia and sterile trauma. The multi-pronged protection appears to be unique and may provide a tool to examine the intersection points in the immune response to infection or injury, and possible ways to prevent secondary tissue damage, such as that reported in patients with COVID-19.","Dobson, Geoffrey P; Biros, Erik; Letson, Hayley L; Morris, Jodie L",Front Immunol,,141

Background: As a highly vulnerable group, people in need of long-term care are particularly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to their care-dependency, measures of social distancing can only be carried out to a very limited extent. In addition, the social and health consequences of reduced contacts are particularly high for nursing home residents. AIM: The study aims to describe the extent to which nursing homes are affected, the human and material resources of nursing homes, the organizational handling of the situation, and their requests for public support. METHODS: More than 7,000 nursing homes were invited to participate in an online survey with quantitative and qualitative elements. Data analysis applies descriptive statistics. RESULTS: 824 nursing homes participated in the survey. One in five nursing homes has at least one confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 among its residents and / or employees. The initial lack of protective equipment has now decreased, but the facilities still have to cope with additional corona-related care needs with reduced staff. Nursing homes have banned contacts between residents and relative to an extent that now has to be reduced again. Nursing homes demand the provision and external financing of protective equipment as well as the systematic and regular testing of nursing staff and the provision of uniform guidelines for action throughout Germany. CONCLUSIONS: As about half of all deceased people with COVID-19 have been living in nursing homes, the support of nursing homes in their attempt to restrict the pandemic requires highest attention.","Rothgang, Heinz; Domhoff, Dominik; Friedrich, Anna-Carina; Heinze, Franziska; Preuss, Benedikt; Schmidt, Annika; Seibert, Kathrin; Stolle, Claudia; Wolf-Ostermann, Karin",Pflege,,141

The emotional geography of tourism development in Bama, China",2021,"Pediatric cases of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are generally mild or asymptomatic, and are usually detected by virological examination following close contact with COVID-19 patients, often the children's parents. The detailed clinical features and virological data of pediatric patients with COVID-19, particularly young infants, remain unclear. Here, the clinical and virological characteristics of four children with COVID-19 including two young infants were investigated. One- and 4-month-old boys with COVID-19 were both asymptomatic, and seroconversion was demonstrated. These findings suggest that even young infants can mount an immune response against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), despite having weaker immune defenses than adolescents and adults. Three-year-old boy, who was SARS-CoV-2-negative, was admitted to the same room as his SARS-CoV-2-positive father due to the lack of caregivers. Although he was asymptomatic, he had seroconverted to SARS-CoV-2. Eleven-year-old boy, who was sibling of the 3-year-old boy, was also SARS-CoV-2-negative. He was isolated in his own room and did not seroconvert. If young children are SARS-CoV-2 negative, they should be isolated from their SARS-CoV-2-positive parents. This may be difficult in practice, if parents with COVID-19 are the only available caregivers. In such situations, the most appropriate measures should be taken for each patient.","Kawamura, Yoshiki; Higashimoto, Yuki; Miura, Hiroki; Ihira, Masaru; Inaba, Masato; Ito, Ryota; Kozawa, Kei; Yoshikawa, Tetsushi",J Med Virol,,141

Tocilizumab is an interleukin-6 (IL-6) inhibitor effective in treating CRS secondary to chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR T-cell) therapy. The efficacy of tocilizumab in treating COVID-19 is unknown. This was a retrospective cohort study conducted at two hospitals in northern New Jersey (USA). All patients treated with tocilizumab for confirmed or suspected COVID-19 between 10 March 2020 and 9 April 2020 at the study sites were included. The primary endpoint was clinical improvement on Day 7 after treatment as assessed by respiratory status. Univariate analysis compared data between those who improved and those who did not. A total of 45 severe and critically ill patients treated with tocilizumab for COVID-19 were evaluated. Of the 45 patients, 11 (24.4%), 22 (48.9%) and 12 (26.7%) patients improved, had no change or worsened by Day 7 after treatment, respectively. Lower white blood cell count and lactate dehydrogenase at the time of drug administration as well as shorter time from supplemental oxygen initiation to dosing were significantly associated with clinical improvement in the univariate analysis.

379621,The Space of Absence: Geography and Education at Mass Distance,2020,"ObjectiveEvaluate antithrombotic (AT) use in individuals with atrial fibrillation (AF) and high stroke risk (CHA2DS2-VASc score>=2) and investigate whether pre-existing AT use may improve COVID-19 outcomes. MethodsIndividuals with AF and a CHA2DS2-VASc score>=2 on January 1st 2020 were identified using pseudonymised, linked electronic health records for 56 million people in England and followed-up until May 1st 2021. Factors associated with pre-existing AT use were analysed using logistic regression. Differences in COVID-19 related hospitalisation and death were analysed using logistic and Cox regression for individuals exposed to pre-existing AT use vs no AT use, anticoagulants (AC) vs antiplatelets (AP) and direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) vs warfarin. ResultsFrom 972,971 individuals with AF and a CHA2DS2-VASc score>=2, 88.0% (n=856,336) had pre-existing AT use, 3.8% (n=37,418) had a COVID-19 related hospitalisation and 2.2% (n=21,116) died. Factors associated with no AT use included comorbidities that may contraindicate AT use (liver disease and history of falls) and demographics (socioeconomic status and ethnicity). Pre-existing AT use was associated with lower odds of death (OR=0.92 [0.87-0.96 at 95% CI]), but higher odds of hospitalisation OR=1.20 [1.15-1.26 at 95% CI]). The same pattern was observed for AC vs AP (death (OR=0.93 [0.87-0.98]), hospitalisation (OR=1.17 [1.11-1.24])) but not for DOACs vs warfarin (death (OR=1.00 [0.95-1.05]), hospitalisation (OR=0.86 [0.82-0.89]). ConclusionsPre-existing AT use may offer marginal protection against COVID-19 death, with AC offering more protection than AP. Although this association may not be causal, it provides further incentive to improve AT coverage for eligible individuals with AF. KEY QUESTIONSO_ST_ABSWhat is already known about this subject?C_ST_ABSO_LIAnticoagulants (AC), a sub-class of antithrombotics (AT), reduce the risk of stroke and are recommended for individuals with atrial fibrillation (AF) and at high risk of stroke (CHA2DS2-VASc score>=2, National Institute for Health and Care Excellence threshold). However, previous evaluations suggest that up to one third of these individuals may not be taking AC. Over estimation of bleeding and fall risk in elderly patients have been identified as potential factors in this under medicating. C_LIO_LIIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, several observational studies have observed correlations between pre-existing AT use, particularly anticoagulants (AC), and lower risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes such as hospitalisation and death. However, these correlations are inconsistent across studies and have not compared all major sub-types of AT in one study. C_LI What does this study add?O_LIThis study uses datasets covering primary care, secondary care, pharmacy dispensing, death registrations, multiple COVID-19 diagnoses routes and vaccination records for 56 million people in England and is the largest scale evaluation of AT use to date. This provides the statistical power to robustly analyse targeted sub-types of AT and control for a wide range of potential confounders. All code developed for the study is opensource and an updated nationwide evaluation can be rapidly created for future time points. C_LIO_LIIn 972,971 individuals with AF and a CHA2DS2-VASc score>=2, we observed 88.0% (n=856,336) with pre-existing AT use which was associated with marginal protection against COVID-19 death (OR=0.92 [0.87-0.96 at 95% CI]). C_LI How might this impact on clinical practice?O_LIThese findings can help shape global AT medication policy and provide population-scale, observational analysis results alongside gold-standard randomised control trials to help assess whether a potential beneficial effect of pre-existing AT use on COVID-19 death alters risk to benefit assessments in AT prescribing decisions.

380729,Problem solving through values: A challenge for thinking and capability development,2020,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, parents with sick or premature babies have faced challenges following admission to a neonatal unit due to the imposed lock-down restrictions on social contact, hospital visitation and the wearing of personal protective equipment. The negative short-term impact on neonatal care in relation to the prevention of proximity, contact and bonding between parents and babies is potentially significant. However, an interesting finding has been reported of a reduction in premature birth admissions to the neonatal intensive care unit during the pandemic, raising important questions. Why was this? Was it related to the effect of the modifiable risk-factors for premature birth? This discussion paper focuses on an exploration of these factors in the light of the potential impact of COVID-19 restrictions on neonatal care. After contextualising both the effect of premature birth and the pandemic on neonatal and parental short-term outcomes, the discussion turns to the modifiable risk-factors for premature birth and makes recommendations relevant to the education, advice and care given to expectant mothers.","Green, Janet; Petty, Julia; Whiting, Lisa; Fowler, Cathrine",Journal of neonatal nursing,,141

The current pandemic also triggers several psychological changes. Uncertainties and changes in health practices may cause anxiety, depression, and concerns on vulnerable populations such as pregnant. This study aims to survey the pregnant women to capture the psychological impact and perceptions during the pandemic. METHODS: A total of 297 pregnant women aged &#8805; 18 years were enrolled in May 2020. We evaluated the hard-copy survey included questions about demographic and clinical information of patients, 95% confidence intervals of a COVID-19-related questionnaire in a Likert scale and 14-item Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). RESULTS: A total of 297 pregnant women were included in this study with a mean age of 27.64. Most patients (82.5%) had concerns about infecting their babies during delivery. The fear of infection of the fetus during delivery revealed elderly age and having anxiety as the unique significant risk factors. Mean HADS-A and HADS-D scores were 7.94 (± 4.03) and 7.23 (± 3.84), respectively. Multivariate analysis showed having anxiety was associated with a high HADS-D score and concern about the inability to reach obstetrician, and being in advanced age, having a high HADS-A score, and concern about the inability to reach obstetrician demonstrated significant effects on HADS-D score. CONCLUSION: We conclude that in future pandemics, communications and reassurance of the patients should be prioritized upon their routine ante-natal care to avoid increased levels of anxiety and even depression.","Akgor, Utku; Fadiloglu, Erdem; Soyak, Burcu; Unal, Canan; Cagan, Murat; Temiz, B Esat; Erzenoglu, B Emre; Ak, Sertac; Gultekin, Murat; Ozyuncu, Ozgur",Arch. gynecol. obstet,,141

382557,Axiological linguistics and teaching of Russian as a foreign language in the context of distance learning against the backdrop of the pandemic,2021,"Lipid nanoparticle (LNP) formulations of nucleic acid are leading vaccine candidates for COVID-19, and enabled the first approved RNAi therapeutic, Onpattro. LNPs are composed of ionizable cationic lipids, phosphatidylcholine, cholesterol, and polyethylene glycol (PEG)-lipids, and are produced using rapid-mixing techniques. These procedures involve dissolution of the lipid components in an organic phase and the nucleic acid in an acidic aqueous buffer (pH 4). These solutions are then combined using a continuous mixing device such as a T-mixer or microfluidic device. In this mixing step, particle formation and nucleic acid entrapment occur. Previous work from our group has shown that, in the absence of nucleic acid, the particles formed at pH 4 are vesicular in structure, a portion of these particles are converted to electron-dense structures in the presence of nucleic acid, and the proportion of electron-dense structures increases with nucleic acid content. What remained unclear from previous work was the mechanism by which vesicles form electron-dense structures. In this study, we use cryogenic transmission electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering to show that efficient siRNA entrapment occurs in the absence of ethanol (contrary to the established paradigm), and suggest that nucleic acid entrapment occurs through inversion of preformed vesicles. We also leverage this phenomenon to show that specialized mixers are not required for siRNA entrapment, and that preformed particles at pH 4 can be used for in vitro transfection.","Kulkarni, Jayesh A; Thomson, Sarah B; Zaifman, Josh; Leung, Jerry; Wagner, Pamela K; Hill, Austin; Tam, Yuen Yi C; Cullis, Pieter R; Petkau, Terri L; Leavitt, Blair R",Nanoscale (Online),,141

383429,"Pandemic abandonment, panoramic displays and fascist propaganda: The month the earth stood still",2020,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak in China was first reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) on December 31, 2019, and the first cases were officially identified around December 8, 2019. Although the origin of COVID-19 has not been confirmed, approximately half of the early cases were linked to a seafood market in Wuhan. However, the first two documented patients did not visit the seafood market. News reports, social media, and informal sources may provide information about outbreaks prior to formal notification. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to identify early signals of pneumonia or severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) in China prior to official recognition of the COVID-19 outbreak in December 2019 using open-source data. METHODS: To capture early reports, we searched an open source epidemic observatory, EpiWatch, for SARI or pneumonia-related illnesses in China from October 1, 2019. The searches were conducted using Google and the Chinese search engine Baidu. RESULTS: There was an increase in reports following the official notification of COVID-19 to the WHO on December 31, 2019, and a report that appeared on December 26, 2019 was retracted. A report of severe pneumonia on November 22, 2019, in Xiangyang was identified, and a potential index patient was retrospectively identified on November 17. CONCLUSIONS: The lack of reports of SARI outbreaks prior to December 31, 2019, with a retracted report on December 26, suggests media censorship, given that formal reports indicate that cases began appearing on December 8. However, the findings also support a relatively recent origin of COVID-19 in November 2019. The case reported on November 22 was transferred to Wuhan approximately one incubation period before the first identified cases on December 8; this case should be further investigated, as only half of the early cases were exposed to the seafood market in Wuhan. Another case of COVID-19 has since been retrospectively identified in Hubei on November 17, 2019, suggesting that the infection was present prior to December.","Kpozehouen, Elizabeth Benedict; Chen, Xin; Zhu, Mengyao; Macintyre, C Raina",JMIR Public Health Surveill,,141

Investigations were consistent with Guillain-Barré syndrome and additional COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. The patient improved after immunoglobulin treatment. At least four cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome have been reported in the literature with concurrent COVID-19 illness in whom respiratory signs appeared a few days after the onset of neurological signs. With the incubation period for COVID-19 respiratory symptoms believed to be up to 14 days, it is possible that neurological symptoms could develop before respiratory and other symptoms.

384864,Legal protection of supply chain management based on technology in the eradication of the covid-19 plague,2019,"Macroautophagy/autophagy is critical in maintaining cellular functions and homeostasis. Dynamic regulation of autophagy is associated with development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH); however, the mechanisms involved in the regulation of autophagy in NAFLD/NASH are not well understood. Here we discuss our recent work identifying MLKL as an important nexus between autophagy and necroptosis in models of NAFLD/NASH. Mlkl, but not Ripk3, deficiency protects mice from Western diet-induced liver injury. Mlkl deficiency also prevents the accumulation of SQSTM1/p62 and LC3-II in liver in response to Western diet feeding or challenge with the protease inhibitor leupeptin. Western diet increases expression, phosphorylation and oligomerization of MLKL. In hepatocytes, palmitic acid (PA) induces the expression and translocation of MLKL to autophagosomes prior to the plasma membrane. Importantly, Mlkl, but not Ripk3, deficiency prevents the inhibition of autophagy by PA or chloroquine in hepatocytes. In contrast, overexpression of Mlkl blocks autophagic flux. Importantly, inhibition of autophagy by leupeptin or chloroquine triggers MLKL translocation to the plasma membrane, suggesting that MLKL is intimately involved in the regulation of autophagy under multiple conditions. These data indicate that MLKL contributes to Western diet-induced liver injury through inhibition of autophagy and induction of necroptosis.","Wu, Xiaoqin; Nagy, Laura E",Autophagy,,141

Activation and retrenchment in Ireland's political economy,2021,"INTRODUCTION: We sought to determine the effectiveness and safety of hydroxychloroquine-azithromycin (HCQ-AZM) therapy in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of 613 patients hospitalized (integrated health system involving three hospitals) for RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 infection between March 1, 2020 and April 25, 2020. Intervention was treatment with HCQ-AZM in hospitalized patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Outcomes of interest were in-hospital all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, non-lethal arrhythmias, and length of hospital stay. Secondary measures included in-hospital corrected QT (QTc) interval parameters and serum biomarkers levels. RESULTS: Propensity-matched groups were composed of 173 patients given HCQ-AZM and 173 matched patients who did not receive treatment. There was no significant difference in in-hospital mortality (odds ratio [OR] 1.52; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.80-2.89; p = 0.2), PEA arrest (OR 1.68, CI 0.68-4.15; p = 0.27), or incidence of non-lethal arrhythmias (10.4% vs. 6.8%; p = 0.28). Length of hospital stay (10.5 ± 7.4 vs. 5.8 ± 6.1; p < 0.001), peak CRP levels (252 ± 136 vs. 166 ± 124; p < 0.0001), and degree of QTc interval prolongation was higher for the HCQ-AZM group (28 ± 32 vs. 9 ± 32; p < 0.0001), but there was no significant difference in incidence of sustained ventricular arrhythmias (2.8% vs. 1.7%; p = 0.52). HCQ-AZM was stopped in 10 patients because of QT interval prolongation and 1 patient because of drug-related polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. CONCLUSION: In this propensity-matched study, there was no difference in in-hospital mortality, life-threatening arrhythmias, or incidence of PEA arrest between the HCQ-AZM and untreated control groups. QTc intervals were longer in patients receiving HCQ-AZM, but only one patient developed drug-related ventricular tachycardia.","Huang, Henry D; Jneid, Hani; Aziz, Mariam; Ravi, Venkatesh; Sharma, Parikshit S; Larsen, Timothy; Chatterjee, Neal; Saour, Basil; Aziz, Zaid; Nayak, Hemal; Trohman, Richard G; Krishnan, Kousik",Cardiol Ther,,141

387637,Nepal in 2020: External Tensions and Internal Challenges,2021,"In the world and in Peru, Acute Respiratory Infections are the main cause of death, especially in the most vulnerable population, children under 5 years of age and older adults. Pneumonia is the leading cause of death of children in the world. 60.2% of pneumonia cases affect children under 5 years of age. Thus, prevention and timely treatment of lung diseases are crucial to reduce infant mortality in Peru. Among the main problems associated with this high is percentage the lack of medical professionals and resources, especially in remote areas, such as Puno, Huancavelica and Arequipa, which experience temperatures as low as -20 degrees C during the cold season. This study develops an algorithm based on computational neural networks to differentiate between normal and abnormal lung sounds. The initial base of 917 sounds was used, through a process of data augmentation, this base was increased to 8253 sounds in total, and this process was carried out due to the need of a large number of data for the use of computational neural networks. From each signal, features were extracted using three methods: MFCC, Melspectogram and STFT. Three models were generated, the first one to classify normal and abnormal, which obtained a training Accuracy of 1 and a testing accuracy of 0.998. The second one classifies normal sound, pneumonia and other abnormalities and obtained training Accuracy values of 0.9959 and a testing accuracy of 0.9885. Finally, we classified by specific ailment where we obtained a training Accuracy of 0.9967 and a testing accuracy of 0.9909. This research provides interesting findings about the diagnosis and classification of lung sounds automatically using convolutional neural networks, which is the beginning for the development of a platform to assess the risk of pneumonia in the first moment, thus allowing rapid care and referral that seeks to reduce mortality associated mainly with pneumonia.","Alicia, A.

Since DNA methylation has been implicated in the regulation of viral infections and the immune system, we performed an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) to identify candidate loci regulated by this epigenetic mark that could be involved in the onset of COVID-19 in patients without comorbidities. METHODS: Peripheral blood samples were obtained from 407 confirmed COVID-19 patients &#8804; 61 years of age and without comorbidities, 194 (47.7%) of whom had mild symptomatology that did not involve hospitalization and 213 (52.3%) had a severe clinical course that required respiratory support. The set of cases was divided into discovery (n = 207) and validation (n = 200) cohorts, balanced for age and sex of individuals. We analysed the DNA methylation status of 850,000 CpG sites in these patients. FINDINGS: The DNA methylation status of 44 CpG sites was associated with the clinical severity of COVID-19. Of these loci, 23 (52.3%) were located in 20 annotated coding genes. These genes, such as the inflammasome component Absent in Melanoma 2 (AIM2) and the Major Histocompatibility Complex, class I C (HLA-C) candidates, were mainly involved in the response of interferon to viral infection. We used the EWAS-identified sites to establish a DNA methylation signature (EPICOVID) that is associated with the severity of the disease. INTERPRETATION: We identified DNA methylation sites as epigenetic susceptibility loci for respiratory failure in COVID-19 patients. These candidate biomarkers, combined with other clinical, cellular and genetic factors, could be useful in the clinical stratification and management of patients infected with the SARS-CoV-2.

389459,"Race, research, and urban education",2021,"Heavy metal (HM) stress in plants has received considerable global attention as it threatens sustainable growth in agriculture worldwide. Hence, desperate efforts have been undertaken for combating the effects of this stress in plants. Interestingly, the use of phytohormones in reducing the impact of HM toxicity has gained much momentum in the recent past. Phytohormones act as chemical messengers that improve the HM stress resistance in plants, thus allowing them to retain their growth and developmental plasticity. Their exogenous application as well as manipulation of endogenous levels through precise targeting of their biosynthesis/signaling components is a promising approach for providing a protective shield against HM stress in plants. However, for the successful use of phytohormones for field plants exposed to HM toxicity, in-depth knowledge of the key pathways regulated by them is of prime importance. Hence, the present review mainly summarizes the key conceptual developments on the involvement of phytohormones in the mitigation of HM stress in plants. The role of various genes, proteins, and signaling components involved in phytohormones associated HM stress tolerance and their modulation has also been discussed. Thus, this update will pave the way for improving HM stress tolerance in plants with the advent of phytohormones for sustainable agriculture growth in the future.","Saini, Shivani; Kaur, Navdeep; Pati, Pratap Kumar",Ecotoxicol Environ Saf,,141

Drug repurposing offers a fast track. Here, we discuss the potential beneficial effects of statins in COVID-19 patients based on evidence that they may target virus receptors, replication, degradation, and downstream responses in infected cells, addressing both basic research and epidemiological information. Briefly, statins could modulate virus entry, acting on the SARS-CoV-2 receptors, ACE2 and CD147, and/or lipid rafts engagement. Statins, by inducing autophagy activation, could regulate virus replication or degradation, exerting protective effects. The well-known anti-inflammatory properties of statins, by blocking several molecular mechanisms, including NF-&#954;B and NLRP3 inflammasomes, could limit the ""cytokine storm"" in severe COVID-19 patients which is linked to fatal outcome. Finally, statin moderation of coagulation response activation may also contribute to improving COVID-19 outcomes.

396322,A Framework for Enabling Safe and Resilient Food Factories for the Public Feeding Programs,2021-03-08,"INTRODUCTION: With the current COVID-19 pandemic, concerns have raised regarding the risk for NIV to promote airborne transmission. In case of hospital admission, continuation of therapy in patients undergoing chronic NIV is necessary and several protective circuit configurations have been recommended to reduce the risk of aerosol dissemination. However, all these configurations increase instrumental dead space. We therefore designed this study to evaluate their effects on the tidal volume (VTE) required to preserve stable end-tidal CO2 partial pressure (PETCO2) with constant respiratory rate. METHODS: A bench consisting of a test lung connected to an adult-sized mannequin head was set up. The model was ventilated through usual domiciliary configuration (single limb circuit with facial vented mask) which was used as reference. Then, five different circuit configurations including non-vented facial mask with viral/bacterial filter, modification of leak position, and change from single to double-limb circuit were evaluated. For each configuration, pressure support (PS) was gradually increased to reach reference PETCO2. Resulting VTE was recorded as primary outcome. RESULTS: Reference PETCO2 was 38(0)mmHg, with a PS set at 10cmH2O, resulting in a VTE of 432(2)mL. Compared to reference, all the configurations evaluated required substantial increase in VTE to preserve alveolar ventilation, ranging from +79(2) to +216(1)mL. CONCLUSIONS: Modifications of NIV configurations in the context of COVID-19 pandemic result in substantial increase of instrumental dead space. Re-evaluation of treatment efficiency and settings is crucial whenever protective measures influencing NIV equipment are considered.","Delorme, Mathieu; Leroux, Karl; Boussaid, Ghilas; Lebret, Marius; Prigent, Helene; Leotard, Antoine; Louis, Bruno; Lofaso, Frédéric",Arch. bronconeumol.

For prevention, South Korea has adopted a local quarantine strategy rather than a global lockdown. This approach not only minimizes economic damage, but it also efficiently prevents the spread of the disease. In this work, the spread of COVID-19 under local quarantine measures is modeled using the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered model on complex networks. In this network approach, the links connected to isolated people are disconnected and then reinstated when they are released. This link dynamics leads to time-dependent reproduction number. Numerical simulations are performed on networks with reaction rates estimated from empirical data. The temporal pattern of the cumulative number of confirmed cases is then reproduced. The results show that a large number of asymptomatic infected patients are detected as they are quarantined together with infected patients. Additionally, possible consequences of the breakdowns of local quarantine measures and social distancing are considered.","Choi, K.; Choi, Hoyun; Kahng, B.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.07157v1.pdf,141

This unique context allowed comparison of multiple virtual and face-to-face (F2F) Balint-type group experiences for participants and facilitators.MethodIn March 2020, existing core trainee (CT) year 1 and 2, higher trainee (ST) and consultant Balint groups became virtual, with new CT3 and Speciality Doctor and Associate Specialist (SAS) virtual Balint groups established.All 57 participants and 5 facilitators were sent an anonymous electronic survey to retrospectively rate virtual Balint (March-August 2020) and their preceding F2F Balint group (suggesting September 2019-February 2020) experience.ResultThe response rate was 89% for participants (51 respondents) and 100% for facilitators (5 respondents).For group participants, 90% (virtual) and 78% (F2F) agreed or strongly agreed that Balint group provided an opportunity to explore challenging aspects of clinical work. 76% (virtual) and 71% (F2F) agreed or strongly agreed that it made them feel more supported. Almost 50% agreed or strongly agreed that virtual and F2F Balint group helped work feel less stressful. Both ratings and free-text feedback emphasised virtual Balint attendance being easier.Facilitators rated virtual and F2F formats similarly highly with regards to exploring difficult doctor-patient interactions, richness of discussions and their enjoyment. Facilitators felt virtual attendance was easier but more draining, with more difficult adherence to Balint group etiquette and boundaries.82% of participants and 75% of facilitators agreed or strongly agreed that virtual format made them more likely to attend future Balint groups. The rich pool of free-text comments received were predominantly positive, whilst noting challenges during virtual Balint in remaining present, with more distractions (for participants) and additional difficulty accessing group dynamics (for facilitators).ConclusionParticipant and facilitator responses indicate Balint-type groups being professionally and clinically beneficial across different psychiatrist grades, and promoting clinician wellbeing when both F2F and virtual during pandemic-related restrictions. Facilitator ratings (unlike participants) suggested specific virtual process challenges such as feeling more drained, perhaps in part due to technical application issues around this emerging format.Both participants and facilitators reported attendance being easier when virtual. Although some suggested returning to F2F post-COVID, more preferred to continue virtually or utilise a blended format. This was particularly for non-CT groups where geographical challenges (e.g. region-wide ST Balint) or competing clinical demands (e.g. consultant/SAS Balint) made regular commitment and attendance more difficult.","Samnani, Sheliza Awal Masud",BJPsych Open,,141

Objective: To conduct an updated and comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis comparing mortality and severe adverse events (AEs) associated with receipt vs nonreceipt of ACEIs or ARBs among patients with COVID-19. Data Sources: PubMed and Embase databases were systematically searched from December 31, 2019, until September 1, 2020. Study Selection: The meta-analysis included any study design, with the exception of narrative reviews or opinion-based articles, in which COVID-19 was diagnosed through laboratory or radiological test results and in which clinical outcomes (unadjusted or adjusted) associated with COVID-19 were assessed among adult patients (&#8805;18 years) receiving ACEIs or ARBs. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Three authors independently extracted data on mortality and severe AEs associated with COVID-19. Severe AEs were defined as intensive care unit admission or the need for assisted ventilation. For each outcome, a random-effects model was used to compare the odds ratio (OR) between patients receiving ACEIs or ARBs vs those not receiving ACEIs or ARBs. Main Outcomes and Measures: Unadjusted and adjusted ORs for mortality and severe AEs associated with COVID-19. Results: A total of 1788 records from the PubMed and Embase databases were identified; after removal of duplicates, 1664 records were screened, and 71 articles underwent full-text evaluation.

401147,COVID-19 Patient Health Management System Using IoT,2021,"Background: In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, the UK National Health Service (NHS) extended eligibility for influenza vaccination this season to approximately 32.4 million people (48.8% of the population). Knowing the intended uptake of the vaccine will inform supply and public health messaging to maximize vaccination. Objective: The objective of this study was to measure the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the acceptance of influenza vaccination in the 2020-2021 season, specifically focusing on people who were previously eligible but routinely declined vaccination and newly eligible people. Methods: Intention to receive the influenza vaccine in 2020-2021 was asked of all registrants of the largest electronic personal health record in the NHS by a web-based questionnaire on July 31, 2020. Of those who were either newly or previously eligible but had not previously received an influenza vaccination, multivariable logistic regression and network diagrams were used to examine their reasons to undergo or decline vaccination. Results: Among 6641 respondents, 945 (14.2%) were previously eligible but were not vaccinated;of these, 536 (56.7%) intended to receive an influenza vaccination in 2020-2021, as did 466 (68.6%) of the newly eligible respondents. Intention to receive the influenza vaccine was associated with increased age, index of multiple deprivation quintile, and considering oneself to be at high risk from COVID-19. Among those who were eligible but not intending to be vaccinated in 2020-2021, 164/543 (30.2%) gave reasons based on misinformation. Of the previously unvaccinated health care workers, 47/96 (49%) stated they would decline vaccination in 2020-2021. Conclusions: In this sample, COVID-19 has increased acceptance of influenza vaccination in previously eligible but unvaccinated people and has motivated substantial uptake in newly eligible people.

A thermodynamic imaging model of infectious diseases was established to calculate the cumulative superimposed density of epidemic in 17 cities (prefectures). An evaluation rule of urban risk grade is established and evaluates the COVID-19 risk of 17 cities. The results show that (1) the higher the superimposed density of urban epidemic, the more infected people. (2) In the incubation stage, the thermodynamic imaging shows a point distribution, random walk, and outward diffusion trend. In the initial stage, the color of thermodynamic imaging gradually deepened and the range gradually expanded. During the burst stage, the thermodynamic imaging color deepens rapidly and the scope expands rapidly. In the stable stage, the thermodynamic imaging color becomes darkest and the range is extended to the pole. (3) According to the situation of COVID-19 transmission in Hubei Province, the cumulative superimposed density of Wuhan epidemic is far more than 10,000, ranking as ""highest-risk."" Xiaogan and other 10 cities have a cumulative superimposed density within the range of [1000, 10,000], ranking as ""high-risk.""

402101,Addressing the digital skills gap for future education,2021,"BACKGROUND: Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is the standard of care in the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and other inflammatory rheumatic diseases and potentially for the treatment in COVID-19 patients. Determination of HCQ for therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) can be performed in whole blood (WB), serum, and plasma. Direct comparisons of WB, serum, and plasma levels of HCQ in patients with SLE have not previously been reported. We describe a method for the determination of HCQ in human blood using liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) and compare the suitability of the three sample matrices. METHODS: A method for the determination of HCQ in human blood using LC-HRMS was developed, validated, and applied for the determination of HCQ levels in WB, serum, and plasma from 26 SLE patients. The reproducibility of the method, in the three matrices, was evaluated using quality control samples and repeated preparations and measurements of patient samples. The performance of the developed method for HCQ measurement in serum was further evaluated by comparison with two previously reported extraction methods. RESULTS: The performance of the presented method demonstrated high accuracy and precision. A large range of HCQ concentrations was observed for the SLE patients in all three matrices (WB, serum, and plasma). The mean levels in WB were approximately two-fold the levels in serum and plasma (813 ng/mL compared to 436 ng/mL and 362 ng/mL, respectively). Spiked quality controls showed high reproducibility for all matrices (coefficient of variation, CV, approx. 5%), whereas in patient samples, equally high-precision was only found using WB as the matrix (CV 3%). The CV for serum and plasma was 14% and 39%, respectively. Two alternative methods applied to serum samples did not demonstrate improved precision. CONCLUSIONS: A LC-HRMS method for the measurement of HCQ in human blood was developed and validated. Whole blood was found to be the superior sample matrix in terms of sample reproducibility. Thus, whole blood samples should be used for HCQ analysis when patients are monitored for HCQ treatment effects. The assay is in clinical use to monitor levels of HCQ in patients.","Carlsson, Henrik; Hjorton, Karin; Abujrais, Sandy; Rönnblom, Lars; Åkerfeldt, Torbjörn; Kultima, Kim",Arthritis Res Ther,,141
402102,Addressing the digital skills gap for future education,2021,"The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) represents a massive global health crisis leading to different reactions in people. Those reactions may be adaptive or not depending on situational or psychological processes. Disordered eating attitudes and behaviors are likely to be exacerbated by the pandemic through multiple pathways as suggested by Rodgers et al. (2020). Among the psychological variables that may have increased dysfunctional eating attitudes and behaviors as a consequence of the social distancing and isolation, we looked at perfectionism. Perfectionism is a well-recognized risk and maintaining factor of eating-related symptoms and interact with stress increasing the probability of dysfunctional reactions (e.g., Wang and Li, 2017). The present study investigated the relationship between multidimensional perfectionism and eating behaviors by considering the mediating role of psychological distress. Data were collected from two countries (Italy and Spain) by means of an online survey. The samples included 465 (63.4% female) participants from Italy and 352 (68.5% female) from Spain. Participants completed the short form of the Hewitt and Flett Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale (Lombardo et al., 2021) to assess self-oriented, other-oriented and socially prescribed perfectionism, as well as the short form of Three Factors Eating Questionnaire (Karlsson et al., 2000) and the Italian version of Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 (Bottesi et al., 2015), respectively used to assess restrictive, emotional and uncontrolled eating on one hand, and depression, anxiety and stress on the other. Multigroup analysis was performed to test the hypothesized model. Results showed that other-oriented and socially prescribed perfectionism were indirectly related to most of the dysfunctional eating aspects through the mediation of psychological distress, and the pattern obtained was consistent in both countries. These findings evidence that the psychological distress potentially related to the COVID-19 disease mediates the negative impact of interpersonal perfectionism and the tendency to eat in response to negative emotions.","Vacca, M.; De Maria, A.; Mallia, L.; Lombardo, C.",Frontiers in Psychology,,141

Currently, Remedesivir is only fully licensed FDA therapeutic. A major target of the vaccine effort is the SARS-CoV-2 spike-hACE2 interaction, and assessment of efficacy relies on time consuming neutralization assay. Here, we developed a cell fusion assay based upon spike-hACE2 interaction. The system was tested by transient co-transfection of 293T cells, which demonstrated good correlation with standard spike pseudotyping for inhibition by sera and biologics. Then established stable cell lines were very well behaved and gave even better correlation with pseudotyping results, after a short, overnight co-incubation. Results with the stable cell fusion assay also correlated well with those of a live virus assay. In summary we have established a rapid, reliable, and reproducible cell fusion assay that will serve to complement the other neutralization assays currently in use, is easy to implement in most laboratories, and may serve as the basis for high throughput screens to identify inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 virus-cell binding and entry.","Zhao, Min; Su, Pei-Yi; Castro, Danielle A; Tripler, Therese N; Hu, Yingxia; Cook, Matthew; Ko, Albert I; Farhadian, Shelli F; Israelow, Benjamin; Dela Cruz, Charles S; Xiong, Yong; Sutton, Richard E",PLoS Pathog,,141

However, current evidence is rather based on limited measurements, losing sight of the temporal pattern of these changes. Methods: We conducted a longitudinal analysis on a prospective cohort of COVID-19 patients followed up for more than 6 months. Neutralizing activity was evaluated using HIV reporter pseudoviruses expressing SARS-CoV-2 S protein. IgG antibody titer was evaluated by ELISA against the S2 subunit, the receptor binding domain (RBD) and the nucleoprotein (NP). Statistical analyses were carried out using mixed-effects models. Findings: We found that individuals with mild or asymptomatic infection experienced an insignificant decay in neutralizing activity, which persisted six months after symptom onset or diagnosis. Hospitalized individuals showed higher neutralizing titers, which decreased following a two-phase pattern, with an initial rapid decline that significantly slowed after day 80. Despite this initial decay, neutralizing activity at six months remained higher among hospitalized individuals compared to mild symptomatic. The slow decline in neutralizing activity at mid-term contrasted with the steep slope of anti-RBD, S2 or NP antibody titers, all of them showing a constant decline over the follow-up period. Conclusions: Our results reinforce the hypothesis that the quality of the neutralizing immune response against SARS-CoV-2 evolves over the post-convalescent stage.

How well do they work?,2021,"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak has killed over a million people since its emergence in late 2019. However, there has been substantial variability in the policies and intensity of diagnostic efforts between countries. In this paper, we quantitatively evaluate the association between national contact tracing policies and case fatality rates of COVID-19 in 138 countries. Our regression analyses indicate that countries that implement comprehensive contact tracing have significantly lower case fatality rates. This association of contact tracing policy and case fatality rates is robust in our longitudinal regression models, even after controlling for the number of tests conducted and non-pharmaceutical control measures adopted by governments. Our results suggest that comprehensive contact tracing is instrumental not only to curtailing transmission but also to reducing case fatality rates. Contact tracing achieves the early detection and isolation of secondary cases which are particularly important given that the peak in infectiousness occurs during the presymptomatic phase. The early detection achieved by contact tracing accelerates the rate at which infected individuals receive medical care they need to maximize their chance of recovery. In addition, the combination of reduced transmission and more rapid recovery diminishes the burden on the healthcare system which in turn ensures that the resources remain available for individuals who do become infected.","Yalaman, Abdullah; Basbug, Gokce; Elgin, Ceyhun; Galvani, Alison P",Sci Rep,,141

In this paper, we propose generalizations of the well-known mutual coherence criterion for optimizing sensing matrices starting from random initial conditions. We term these generalizations as bi-coherence or tri-coherence and they are based on a criterion that discourages any one column of the sensing matrix from being close to a sparse linear combination of other columns. We also incorporate training data to further improve the sensing matrices through weighted coherence, weighted bi-coherence, or weighted tri-coherence criteria, which assign weights to sensing matrix columns as per their importance. An algorithm is also presented to solve the optimization problems. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated through empirical results.","Anjarlekar, Ameya; Rajwade, Ajit",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.02645v1.pdf,141

However, a deeper knowledge of antibiotic distribution within a collapsed lung is necessary for effective antibiotic prophylaxis of pneumonia. Patients and Methods: The pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) of cefuroxime were compared between the plasma and interstitial fluid (ISF) of collapsed and ventilated lungs in 10 anesthetized pigs, which were ventilated through a double-lumen endotracheal cannula. Cefuroxime (20 mg/kg) was administered in single 30-minute intravenous infusion. Samples of blood and lung microdialysate were collected until six hours post-dose. Ultrafiltration, in vivo retrodialysis, and high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry were used to determine plasma and ISF concentrations of free drug. The concentrations were examined with non-compartmental analysis and compartmental modeling. Results: The concentration of free cefuroxime in ISF was lower in the non-ventilated lung than the ventilated one, evidenced by a lung penetration factor of 47% versus 63% (p < 0.05), the ratio between maximum concentrations (65%, p < 0.05), and the ratio between the areas under the concentration-time curve (78%, p = 0.12). The time needed to reach a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was 30%-40% longer for a collapsed lung than for a ventilated one. In addition, a delay of 10-40 minutes was observed for lung ISF compared with plasma. The mean residence time values (ISF collapsed lung > ISF ventilated lung > plasma) could explain the absence of practically important differences in the time interval with the concentration of cefuroxime exceeding the MICs of sensitive strains (&#8804;4 mg/L). Conclusion: The concentration of cefuroxime in the ISF of a collapsed porcine lung is lower than in a ventilated one; furthermore, its equilibration with plasma is delayed. Administration of the first cefuroxime dose earlier or at a higher rate may be warranted, as well as dose intensification of the perioperative prophylaxis of pneumonia caused by pathogens with higher MICs.","Dergel, Martin; Voborník, Martin; Pojar, Marek; Karalko, Mikita; Gofus, Jan; Radochová, Vera; Studená, Sárka; Maláková, Jana; Turek, Zdenek; Chládek, Jaroslav; Mandák, Jirí","Surg. infect.,(Larchmt.)",,141

Therefore, there is urgent need to understand the molecular mechanisms governing SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, immune evasion, and disease progression. Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 can block IRF3 and NF-&#954;B activation early during virus infection. We also identify that the SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins NSP1 and NSP13 can block interferon activation via distinct mechanisms. NSP1 antagonizes interferon signaling by suppressing host mRNA translation, while NSP13 downregulates interferon and NF-&#954;B promoter signaling by limiting TBK1 and IRF3 activation, as phospho-TBK1 and phospho-IRF3 protein levels are reduced with increasing levels of NSP13 protein expression. NSP13 can also reduce NF-&#954;B activation by both limiting NF-&#954;B phosphorylation and nuclear translocation. Last, we also show that NSP13 binds to TBK1 and downregulates IFIT1 protein expression. Collectively, these data illustrate that SARS-CoV-2 bypasses multiple innate immune activation pathways through distinct mechanisms.","Vazquez, Christine; Swanson, Sydnie E; Negatu, Seble G; Dittmar, Mark; Miller, Jesse; Ramage, Holly R; Cherry, Sara; Jurado, Kellie A",PLoS One,,141

In Germany, there are currently more than 2,000,000 laboratory-confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases including 51,800 deaths. However, regional differences also became apparent and with the second wave of infections, the detailed characterization of COVID-19 patients is crucial to early diagnosis and disruption of chains of infections. METHODS: Handing out detailed questionnaires to all individuals tested for COVID-19, we evaluated the clinical characteristics of negative and positive tested individuals. Expression of symptoms, symptom duration and association between predictor variables (i.e. age, gender) and a binary outcome (olfactory and gustatory dysfunction) were assessed. RESULTS: Overall, the most common symptoms among individuals who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 were fatigue, headache, and cough. Olfactory and gustatory dysfunction were also reported by many SARS-CoV-2 negative individuals, more than 20% of SARS-CoV-2 negative tested individuals in our study reported olfactory and gustatory dysfunction. Independent of SARS-CoV-2 status, more females displayed symptoms of gustatory (29.8%, p = 0.0041) and olfactory dysfunction (22.9%, p = 0.0174) compared to men. CONCLUSIONS: Bringing early SARS-CoV-2 tests to the populations at risk must be a main focus for the upcoming months. The reliability of olfactory and gustatory dysfunction in COVID-19 negative tested individuals requires deeper investigation in the future.","Kusnik, Alexander; Weiss, Christel; Neubauer, Melanie; Huber, Bianca; Gerigk, Marlis; Miethke, Thomas; Hunter, Nicole; Rotter, Nicole; Ludwig, Sonja; Schell, Angela; Ebert, Matthias P; Teufel, Andreas",BMC Infect Dis,,141

413872,Forecasting Time Series with Multiplicative Trend Exponential Smoothing and LSTM: COVID-19 Case Study,2021,"This article philosophically analyzes online exam supervision technologies, which have been thrust into the public spotlight due to campus lockdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic and the growing demand for online courses. Online exam proctoring technologies purport to provide effective oversight of students sitting online exams, using artificial intelligence (AI) systems and human invigilators to supplement and review those systems. Such technologies have alarmed some students who see them as `Big Brother-like', yet some universities defend their judicious use. Critical ethical appraisal of online proctoring technologies is overdue. This article philosophically analyzes these technologies, focusing on the ethical concepts of academic integrity, fairness, non-maleficence, transparency, privacy, respect for autonomy, liberty, and trust. Most of these concepts are prominent in the new field of AI ethics and all are relevant to the education context. The essay provides ethical considerations that educational institutions will need to carefully review before electing to deploy and govern specific online proctoring technologies.","Coghlan, Simon; Miller, Tim; Paterson, Jeannie",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.07647v1.pdf,141
414070,The New Normal: Social Media’S Novel Roles And Utilisation,2020,"The pandemic creates unprecedented challenges to society and to health care systems around the world. Like all crises, these provide a unique opportunity to rethink the fundamental limiting assumptions and institutional inertia of our established systems. These inertial assumptions have obscured deeply rooted problems in health care and deflected attempts to address them. As hospitals begin to welcome all patients back, they should resist the temptation to go back to business as usual. Instead, they should retain the more deliberative, explicit, and transparent ways of thinking that have informed the development of crisis standards of care. The key lesson to be learned from those exercises in rational deliberation is that justice must be the ethical foundation of all standards of care. Justice demands that hospitals take a safety-net approach to providing services that prioritizes the most vulnerable segments of society, continue to expand telemedicine in ways that improve access without exacerbating disparities, invest in community-based care, and fully staff hospitals and clinics on nights and weekends.","Garrett, Jeremy R; McNolty, Leslie Ann; Wolfe, Ian D; Lantos, John D",Hastings Cent Rep,,141

This experiment tested the impact of adding information to negative test result messages about (a) residual risk and (b) need to continue protective behaviours. Design4 (residual risk) x 2 (post-test result behaviours) between-subjects design. SettingOnline. Participants1200 adults from a representative UK sample recruited via Prolific (12-15 March 2021). InterventionsParticipants were randomly allocated to one of eight messages. Residual risk messages were: 1) Your coronavirus test result is negative (control); 2) Message 1 plus Its likely you were not infectious when the test was done (Current NHS Test & Trace); 3) Message 2 plus But there is still a chance you may be infectious (Elaborated NHS T&T); 4) Message 3 plus infographic depicting residual risk (Elaborated NHS T&T + infographic). Each message contained either no additional information or information about behaviour, i.e. the need to continue following guidelines and protective behaviours. Outcome measures(i) proportion understanding residual risk of infectiousness and (ii) likelihood of engaging in protective behaviours (score range 0-7). ResultsThe control message decreased understanding relative to the current NHS T&T message: 54% vs 71% (AOR=0.37 95% CI [0.22, 0.61], p<.001). Understanding increased with the elaborated NHS T&T (89%; AOR=3.27 95% CI [1.78, 6.02], p<.001) and elaborated NHS T&T + infographic (91%; AOR=4.03 95% CI [2.14, 7.58], p<.001) compared to current NHS T&T message. Likelihood of engaging in protective behaviours was unaffected by information (F(1,1192)=0.43, p=.513), being high (M=6.4, SD=0.9) across the sample. ConclusionsThe addition of a single sentence ( But there is still a chance you may be infectious) to current NHS Test & Trace wording increased understanding of the residual risk of infection.

Considering the possibility of dilution factor in pool testing, an attempt was made to find out possibility of any true positive sample/s in pools with late amplification. METHODS: The study was conducted on samples received from various collection centres in different districts of Odisha as well as from patients attending the screening clinic or admitted in COVID ward of the hospital. Nasal/nasopharyngeal/throat swabs received in viral transport media in cold chain were subjected to RT-PCR testing in a Biosafety Laboratory level-2 by including uniform volume of 4 units (samples) per pool. All confirmed and probable positive pools in screening assay were de-convoluted and individual samples tested for confirmatory assay. RESULT: Inclusion of an additional criteria of probable positive pool (Ct value >35 with non-sigmoid amplification curve or showing a line of amplification towards the end of the cycle) yielded 39 (15.5%) more true positive samples out of a total of 251 positive samples that would otherwise have been missed if only the classical criteria of positive (Ct within 35 with proper sigmoid curve) had been considered. CONCLUSION: The study highlights the importance of considering any indication of late amplification in the RT-PCR test to label a pool as positive to avoid missing any true positive sample in the pool.

423316,The viralization of online education: Learning beyond the time of the coronavirus,2021,"The closure of schools as a result of COVID-19 has been a critical global incident from which to rethink how education works in all our countries. Among the many changes generated by this crisis, all teaching became mediated by digital technologies. This paper intends to analyze the activities carried out during this time through digital technologies and the conceptions of teaching and learning that they reflect. We designed a Likert-type online questionnaire to measure the frequency of teaching activities. It was answered by 1,403 teachers from Spain (734 primary and 669 secondary education teachers). The proposed activities varied depending on the learning promoted (reproductive or constructive), the learning outcomes (verbal, procedural, or attitudinal), the type of assessment to which the activities were directed, and the presence of cooperative activities. The major result of this study was that teachers used reproductive activities more frequently than constructive ones. We also found that most activities were those favoring verbal and attitudinal learning. The cooperative activities were the least frequent. Finally, through a cluster analysis, we identified four teaching profiles depending on the frequency and type of digital technologies use: Passive, Active, Reproductive, and Interpretative. The variable that produced the most consistent differences was previous digital technologies use These results show that Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) uses are reproductive rather than constructive, which impedes effective digital technologies integration into the curriculum so that students gain 21st-century competencies.","Pozo, J.

423919,One Step Ahead: A Framework for Detecting Unexpected Incidents and Predicting the Stock Markets,2021,"Current approaches for oral health care rely on procedures that are unaffordable to impoverished populations, whereas aerosolized droplets in the dental clinic and poor oral hygiene may contribute to spread of several infectious diseases including COVID-19, requiring new solutions for dental biofilm/plaque treatment at home. Plant cells have been used to produce monoclonal antibodies or antimicrobial peptides for topical applications to decrease colonization of pathogenic microbes on dental surface. Therefore, we investigated an affordable method for dental biofilm disruption by expressing lipase, dextranase or mutanase in plant cells via the chloroplast genome. Antibiotic resistance gene used to engineer foreign genes into the chloroplast genome were subsequently removed using direct repeats flanking the aadA gene and enzymes were successfully expressed in marker-free lettuce transplastomic lines. Equivalent enzyme units of plant-derived lipase performed better than purified commercial enzymes against biofilms, specifically targeting fungal hyphae formation. Combination of lipase with dextranase and mutanase suppressed biofilm development by degrading the biofilm matrix, with concomitant reduction of bacterial and fungal accumulation. In chewing gum tablets formulated with freeze-dried plant cells, expressed protein was stable up to 3 years at ambient temperature and was efficiently released in a time-dependent manner using a mechanical chewing simulator device. Development of edible plant cells expressing enzymes eliminates the need for purification and cold-chain transportation, providing a potential translatable therapeutic approach. Biofilm disruption through plant enzymes and chewing gum-based delivery offers an effective and affordable dental biofilm control at home particularly for populations with minimal oral care access.","Singh, Rahul; Ren, Zhi; Shi, Yao; Lin, Shina; Kwon, Kwang-Chul; Balamurugan, Shanmugaraj; Rai, Vineeta; Mante, Francis; Koo, Hyun; Daniell, Henry",Plant biotechnol. j.

We previously reported the efficacy of the Hokkaido Ultrasonography (US)-based scoring system (HokUS-10) for US findings. To establish easier-to-use criteria, we retrospectively evaluated US findings from 441 patients, including 30 patients with SOS using the HokUS-10 scoring system. Using logistic regression analysis, we established the novel diagnostic criteria HokUS-6. In the presence of ascites, US diagnosis was made in the presence of two of the following 6 parameters: moderate amount of ascites, the appearance of a paraumbilical vein blood flow signal, gallbladder wall thickening, portal vein dilatation, portal vein velocity decrease, and hepatic artery resistive index increase. The AUC, sensitivity, and specificity of HokUS-6 were 0.974 (95% confidence interval 0.962-0.990), 95.2%, and 96.9%, respectively. The scores were significantly higher in patients with severe SOS than in those with non-severe SOS (p = 0.013). Furthermore, the scores before HSCT were significantly higher in patients who developed SOS than in controls (p = 0.001).

424916,A Conceptual Framework for Large-Scale Event Perception Evaluation with Spatial-Temporal Scales in Sustainable Smart Cities,2021,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed challenges that medical students face when healthcare systems are under intense pressure. There is a need to assess medical students' education needs in pandemic preparedness. The objective of this mixed-methods study was threefold: (1) to assess COVID-19 perceived efficacy, susceptibility, and anxiety in relation to health literacy; (2) to describe attitudes towards a policy of precautionary measures against COVID-19 and willingness to work during an outbreak; and (3) to examine multilevel factors associated with willingness to work. METHODS: An online survey was conducted among 263 medical students in Singapore during the lockdown period in July 2020. Participants were surveyed on COVID-19 related literacy, perceptions, anxiety, attitudes towards a policy of precautionary measures, and willingness to work during an outbreak. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were used to determine the factors associated with the key outcome variable of willingness to work. In addition, open-ended questions were used to assess medical education needs, which were reported using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Perceived adequacy of COVID-19 information was associated with higher perceived efficacy, lower perceived susceptibility, and lower anxiety levels among the students. Medical students were mostly supportive of COVID-19 precautionary measures except for relatively intrusive measures like in-home surveillance. The degree of willingness to work during an outbreak varied based on certain conditions, in particular family's health and safety, and was associated with self-efficacy, perceived susceptibility, and hospital capacity of outbreak management. CONCLUSIONS: Medical students' attitudes towards a policy of precautionary measures varied depending on legality, financial and psychological support, and privacy concerns. Health literacy played an important role in increasing the efficacy of protection against COVID-19 and reducing pandemic-related anxiety among medical students. Their willingness to work during an outbreak was increased by an effective policy of precautionary measures, hospital capacity to manage a pandemic, and assurance of family safety. Medical education should include pandemic preparedness to better prepare students to aid in pandemics, with emphasis on public health policy and ethics coupled with clinical training targeted to managing outbreaks.","Koh, Tricia Jia Wen; Ling, Abel Ho Zhi; Chiang, Christine Li Ling; Lee, Gabriel Sheng Jie; Tay, Hannah Si En; Yi, Huso",BMC Med Educ,,141
424917,A Conceptual Framework for Large-Scale Event Perception Evaluation with Spatial-Temporal Scales in Sustainable Smart Cities,2021,"OBJECTIVES: We sought to determine the relationships between muscle size, function, and polar second moments of area (J) at the midshaft femur, proximal tibia, and midshaft tibia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used peripheral quantitative computed tomography to quantify right femoral and tibial J and soft tissue cross-sectional areas, and force plate mechanography to quantify peak power output and maximum force of the right limb, among athletic women and control subjects. RESULTS: Lower limb bone J exhibited strong relationships with estimated force but not power between both groups. Among controls, the strongest relationships between force and J were found at the midshaft femur. Among athletes, these relationships shifted to the tibia, regardless of body size, likely reflecting functional strain related to the major knee extensors and ankle plantarflexors. Together, muscle force and stature explained as much as 82 and 48% of the variance in lower limb bone J among controls and athletes, respectively. DISCUSSION: Results highlight the importance of considering relevant muscle function variables (e.g., force and lever arm lengths) when interpreting behavioral signatures from skeletal remains. Future work to improve the estimation of muscle force from skeletal remains, and incorporate it with lever arm length into analyses, is warranted. Results also suggest that, in doing so, functional relationships between a given section location and musculature should be considered.","Murray, Alison A; Stock, Jay T",Am. j. phys. anthropol,,141

International law as hedging: Perspectives from secondary authoritarian states,2020,"BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer is the second commonly seen cancer around the world and accounts for 13% of all human cancers. Among them, 25% of all case were diagnosed with metastasis and 50% occurs metastasis during the development of disease. Cetuximab is a chimeric monoclonal antibody against epidermal growth factor receptor, and is used for treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer alone or combined with chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Integrin-beta 1 (ITGB1), which is also known as CD29, and plays an important role in development of malignant cancers. However, the effect of ITGB1 in promoting the anti-tumor effect of cetuximab is not fully understand. METHODS: The model of ITGB1 inhibition and overexpression was firstly constructed in LS174T cells, and the viability of cells in each group was detected using CCK-8 assay. The expression of key factors in tumor formation process at transcription level was detected using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction method. The expression of key proteins in metastasis process, cell apoptosis and activation of Ras/Raf/MEK signaling pathway was detected using western blotting analysis. And the concentration of key factors of in tumor formation process in cultured medium of LS174T cells were detected using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. RESULTS: We found that cetuximab could inhibit the proliferation of LS174T cells, and inhibition of ITGB1 enhanced this effect while overexpression of ITGB1 reduced this effect. We further found that cetuximab could inhibit the expression and secretion of extracellular matrix degradation related molecules in cultured medium and transcription level. Besides, we also found that the expression of key factors in angiogenesis and extracellular matrix degradation related proteins were also reduced after cetuximab treatment. These effects might be mediated by Ras/Raf/MAPK signaling pathway and enhanced after inhibition of ITGB1 expression. CONCLUSION: Inhibition of ITGB1 might be a new therapeutic method in colorectal cancer.","Yang, Xiaohui; Wang, Shuai; Yu, Weihua; Zheng, Yixiong; Wu, Yulian",Medicine (Baltimore),,141

430305,On analyzing the household energy consumption detection for citizen behavioral analysis carbon footprint awareness by deep residual networks,2020,"A persistent enigma is the rarity of polyploidy in animals, compared to its prevalence in plants. Although animal polyploids are thought to experience deleterious genomic chaos during initial polyploidization and subsequent rediploidization processes, this hypothesis has not been tested. We provide an improved reference-quality de novo genome for allotetraploid goldfish whose origin dates to ~15 million years ago. Comprehensive analyses identify changes in subgenomic evolution from asymmetrical oscillation in goldfish and common carp to diverse stabilization and balanced gene expression during continuous rediploidization. The homoeologs are coexpressed in most pathways, and their expression dominance shifts temporally during embryogenesis. Homoeolog expression correlates negatively with alternation of DNA methylation. The results show that allotetraploid cyprinids have a unique strategy for balancing subgenomic stabilization and diversification. Rediploidization process in these fishes provides intriguing insights into genome evolution and function in allopolyploid vertebrates.","Luo, Jing; Chai, Jing; Wen, Yanling; Tao, Min; Lin, Guoliang; Liu, Xiaochuan; Ren, Li; Chen, Zeyu; Wu, Shigang; Li, Shengnan; Wang, Yude; Qin, Qinbo; Wang, Shi; Gao, Yun; Huang, Feng; Wang, Lu; Ai, Cheng; Wang, Xiaobo; Li, Lianwei; Ye, Chengxi; Yang, Huimin; Luo, Mi; Chen, Jie; Hu, Hong; Yuan, Liujiao; Zhong, Li; Wang, Jing; Xu, Jian; Du, Zhenglin; Ma, Zhanshan Sam; Murphy, Robert W; Meyer, Axel; Gui, Jianfang; Xu, Peng; Ruan, Jue; Chen, Z Jeffrey; Liu, Shaojun; Lu, Xuemei; Zhang, Ya-Ping",Sci.

From that date, the Regional Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Trust (AREU) of the Lombardy region decided to apply Business Intelligence (BI) to the management of EMS during the epidemic. The aim of the study is to assess in this context the impact of BI on EMS management outcomes. METHODS: Since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, AREU is using BI daily to track the number of first aid requests received from 112. BI analyses the number of requests that have been classified as respiratory and/or infectious episodes during the telephone dispatch interview. Moreover, BI allows identifying the numerical trend of episodes in each municipality (increasing, stable, decreasing). RESULTS: AREU decides to reallocate in the territory the resources based on real-time data recorded and elaborated by BI. Indeed, based on that data, the numbers of vehicles and personnel have been implemented in the municipalities that registered more episodes and where the clusters are supposed to be. BI has been of paramount importance in taking timely decisions on the management of EMS during COVID-19 outbreak. Conclusions: Even if there is little evidence-based literature focused on BI impact within the health care, this study suggests that BI can be usefully applied to promptly identify clusters and patterns of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and, consequently, make informed decisions that can improve the EMS management response to the outbreak.","Sechi, Giuseppe Maria; Migliori, Maurizio; Dassi, Gabriele; Pagliosa, Andrea; Bonora, Rodolfo; Oradini-Alacreu, Aurea; Odone, Anna; Signorelli, Carlo; Zoli, Alberto; Response Team, Areu Covid-",Acta Biomed,,141

431910,Circular Economy and Sustainability as a Basis for Economic Recovery Post-COVID-19,2021,"Background: For the preventive treatment of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) an unprecedented global research effort studied the safety and efficacy of new vaccine platforms that have not been previously used in humans. Less than one year after the discovery of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral sequence, these vaccines were approved for use in the European Union (EU) as well as in numerous other countries and mass vaccination efforts began. The so far in the EU approved mRNA vaccines BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 are based on similar lipid-based nanoparticle carrier technologies; however, the lipid components differ. Severe allergic reactions and anaphylaxis after COVID-19 vaccination are very rare adverse events but have drawn attention due to potentially lethal outcomes and have triggered a high degree of uncertainty. Methods: Current knowledge on anaphylactic reactions to vaccines and specifically the new mRNA COVID-19 vaccines was compiled using a literature search in Medline, PubMed, as well as the national and international study and guideline registries, the Cochrane Library, and the Internet, with special reference to official websites of the World Health Organization (WHO), US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Robert Koch Institute (RKI), and Paul Ehrlich Institute (PEI). Results: Based on the international literature and previous experience, recommendations for prophylaxis, diagnosis and therapy of these allergic reactions are given by a panel of experts. Conclusion: Allergy testing is not necessary for the vast majority of allergic patients prior to COVID-19 vaccination with currently licensed vaccines. In case of allergic/anaphylactic reactions after vaccination, allergy workup is recommended, as it is for a small potential risk population prior to the first vaccination. Evaluation and approval of diagnostic tests should be done for this purpose.","Klimek, Ludger; Bergmann, Karl-Christian; Brehler, Randolf; Pfützner, Wolfgang; Zuberbier, Torsten; Hartmann, Karin; Jakob, Thilo; Novak, Natalija; Ring, Johannes; Merk, Hans; Hamelmann, Eckard; Ankermann, Tobias; Schmidt, Sebastian; Untersmayr, Eva; Hötzenecker, Wolfram; Jensen-Jarolim, Erika; Brockow, Knut; Mahler, Vera; Worm, Margitta",Allergo J Int,,141

433702,A new vision for Europe’s bioeconomy in a post-COVID world,2021,"The global electric power industry is under pressure due to economic downturn, decreasing demand, lowering energy prices, and growing non-payments. National electric power industries face similar challenges. These challenges pose threats to many other sectors of economy due to ongoing digital transformation. The paper focuses on the Russian electric power industry future development trajectories, as well as implications for other sectors of economy. With the use of smart energy approach and foresight methods, the authors identified four scenarios until 2030. The Conservative scenario presumes that the current policy in the industry will be maintained. The visionary Smart Energy scenario envisages structural changes in the industry with a focus on clean energy, decentralization, and new cross-sectoral solutions. The Recurrent COVID-19 scenario previews ongoing pandemic outbreaks until 2025. The One More Wild Card scenario foresees the emergence of yet another wild card – an unexpected event that, together with the COVID-19 pandemic, will have a profound effect on the centralized power systems. Policy recommendations are outlined for each scenario. The study outcomes should be revisited periodically in order to incorporate new changes in external environment, factors and trends.","Proskuryakova, Liliana Kyzyngasheva Elena Starodubtseva Alena",Smart Energy,,141
434053,Accelerating supply chains with Ant Colony Optimization across a range of hardware solutions,2020,"Minimally invasive surgery for total mesorectal excision (TME) remains technically challenging due to poor maneuverability within the pelvis, which makes extremely difficult to introduce a laparoscopic stapler (LS) for the rectal transection. We aim to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis on robotic TME after the use of robotic stapler (RS) or LS after robotic TME. A systematic literature search was performed using PubMed, MEDLINE, and Cochrane Database. Participants who underwent robotic anterior resection were considered following these criteria: (1) studies comparing RS and LS; (2) studies reporting the rate of anastomotic leakage (AL). The primary outcome was the risk of AL. Secondary outcomes included the number of firings of stapler needed. A meta-analysis based on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement was performed. A total of 4 studies including 391 patients (LS = 251, RS = 140) were included for analysis. Regarding the number of firings, overall results suggest that the rectal stapling was achieved with less firings in the RS group, but the difference is not significant [risk difference, (95% CI) 0.42 (- 0.13, 0.97)]. There was a 56% increased odds of AL for LS compared with RS; however, this was not statistically significant (OR: 1.56; 95% CI 0.59, 4.14). With the current literature evidence, the present study could not demonstrate a clear benefit of the RS over the LS. Although the development of an AL is multifactorial and unpredictable, our data may suggest that the use of the RS could help reducing the risk of AL. There is a need of future randomized clinical trial to assess the possible benefits of the RS.","Tejedor, Patricia; Sagias, Filippos; Flashman, Karen; Kandala, Ngianga Li; Khan, Jim",,,141
434054,Accelerating supply chains with Ant Colony Optimization across range of hardware solutions,2020-01-22,"OBJECTIVE: To test for an association between surgical delay and overall survival (OS) for patients with T2 renal masses. Many health care systems are balancing resources to manage the current COVID-19 pandemic, which may result in surgical delay for patients with large renal masses. METHODS: Using Cox proportional hazard models, we analyzed data from the National Cancer Database for patients undergoing extirpative surgery for clinical T2N0M0 renal masses between 2004 and 2015. Study outcomes were to assess for an association between surgical delay with OS and pathologic stage. RESULTS: We identified 11,848 patients who underwent extirpative surgery for clinical T2 renal masses. Compared with patients undergoing surgery within 2 months of diagnosis, we found worse OS for patients with a surgical delay of 3-4 months (hazard ratio [HR] 1.12, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.00-1.25) or 5-6 months (HR 1.51, 95% CI 1.19-1.91). Considering only healthy patients with Charlson Comorbidity Index = 0, worse OS was associated with surgical delay of 5-6 months (HR 1.68, 95% CI 1.21-2.34, P= .002) but not 3-4 months (HR 1.08, 95% CI 0.93-1.26, P = 309). Pathologic stage (pT or pN) was not associated with surgical delay. CONCLUSION: Prolonged surgical delay (5-6 months) for patients with T2 renal tumors appears to have a negative impact on OS while shorter surgical delay (3-4 months) was not associated with worse OS in healthy patients. The data presented in this study may help patients and providers to weigh the risk of surgical delay versus the risk of iatrogenic SARS-CoV-2 exposure during resurgent waves of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Ginsburg, Kevin B; Curtis, Gannon L; Patel, Devin N; Chen, Wen Min; Strother, Marshall C; Kutikov, Alexander; Derweesh, Ithaar H; Cher, Michael L",Urology,,141

435150,Preface: Technical Commission Iv,2021,"Introduction: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is an important complication in COVID-19, but its precise etiology has not fully been elucidated. Insights into AKI mechanisms may be provided by analyzing the temporal associations of clinical parameters reflecting disease processes and AKI development. Methods: We performed an observational cohort study of 223 consecutive COVID-19 patients treated at 3 sites of a tertiary care referral center to describe the evolvement of severe AKI (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes stage 3) and identify conditions promoting its development. Descriptive statistics and explanatory multivariable Cox regression modeling with clinical parameters as time-varying covariates were used to identify risk factors of severe AKI. Results: Severe AKI developed in 70 of 223 patients (31%) with COVID-19, of which 95.7% required kidney replacement therapy. Patients with severe AKI were older, predominantly male, had more comorbidities, and displayed excess mortality. Severe AKI occurred exclusively in intensive care unit patients, and 97.3% of the patients developing severe AKI had respiratory failure. Mechanical ventilation, vasopressor therapy, and inflammatory markers (serum procalcitonin levels and leucocyte count) were independent time-varying risk factors of severe AKI. Increasing inflammatory markers displayed a close temporal association with the development of severe AKI. Sensitivity analysis on risk factors of AKI stage 2 and 3 combined confirmed these findings. Conclusion: Severe AKI in COVID-19 was tightly coupled with critical illness and systemic inflammation and was not observed in milder disease courses. These findings suggest that traditional systemic AKI mechanisms rather than kidney-specific processes contribute to severe AKI in COVID-19.","Hardenberg, Jan-Hendrik B; Stockmann, Helena; Aigner, Annette; Gotthardt, Inka; Enghard, Philipp; Hinze, Christian; Balzer, Felix; Schmidt, Danilo; Zickler, Daniel; Kruse, Jan; Körner, Roland; Stegemann, Miriam; Schneider, Thomas; Schumann, Michael; Müller-Redetzky, Holger; Angermair, Stefan; Budde, Klemens; Weber-Carstens, Steffen; Witzenrath, Martin; Treskatsch, Sascha; Siegmund, Britta; Spies, Claudia; Suttorp, Norbert; Rauch, Geraldine; Eckardt, Kai-Uwe; Schmidt-Ott, Kai M",,,141

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess incidence of postvaccination SARS-CoV-2 infection among vaccinated HCWs. METHODSWe searched multiple databases from inception through August 2021 to identify studies that reported on incidence of postvaccination SARS-CoV-2 infection among HCWs. Meta-analysis was performed to determine pooled proportions of COVID-19 infection in partially and fully vaccinated individuals. RESULTSEighteen studies with 228,873 HCWs were included in the final analysis. Total number of partially vaccinated, fully vaccinated, and unvaccinated HCWs were 132,922, 155,673 and 17505, respectively. Overall pooled proportion of COVID-19 infections among partially/fully vaccinated and unvaccinated HCWs was 2.1% (95% CI 1.2-3.5). Among partially vaccinated, fully vaccinated and unvaccinated HCWs, pooled proportion of COVID-19 infections was 3.7% (95% CI 1.8-7.3), 1.3% (95% CI 0.6-2.9), and 10.1% (95% CI 4.5-19.5), respectively. DISCUSSIONOur analysis shows the risk of COVID-19 infection in both partially and fully vaccinated HCWs remains exceedingly low when compared to unvaccinated individuals. There remains an urgent need for all frontline HCWs to be vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Chandan, Saurabh; Khan, Shahab R.; Deliwala, Smit; Mohan, Babu P.; Ramai, Daryl; Chandan, Ojasvini C.; Facciorusso, Antonio",,,141

438359,The challenges facing the NHS in England in 2021,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has presented unique challenges to medical education. With the lack of in-person away rotations for the 2020-2021 residency application cycle, virtual rotations have surfaced as an alternative. The virtual rotations that the authors participated in allowed for active participation in various resident educational activities such as journal club, grand rounds, and morning conferences. One critical aspect of virtual rotations was the one-on-one meetings with the program leadership. In addition to a virtual tour of the hospital and campus, many programs offered virtual social hours with the residents to converse about the program, the city, and the match process. A few programs even allowed applicants to attend virtually live-streamed surgeries. These rotations offer students, especially those without a corresponding home program, an invaluable opportunity to express their interest in a particular program and gain foundational knowledge about the specialty. Virtual rotations also provide underrepresented minorities and international medical graduates with clinical exposure, mentorship, and networking opportunities, mitigating some of the challenges presented by COVID-19.","Asaad, Malke; Glassman, Gabriella E; Allam, Omar",J. surg. res,,141

Methods: We conducted a retrospective, single-center case series of the seven maintenance hemodialysis (HD) patients infected with COVID-19 at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University from 13 January to 7 April 2020 and a proactive search of potential cases by chest computed tomography (CT) scans. Results: Of 202 HD patients, 7 (3.5%) were diagnosed with COVID-19. Five were diagnosed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) because of compatible symptoms, while two were diagnosed by RT-PCR as a result of screening 197 HD patients without respiratory symptoms by chest CT. Thirteen of 197 patients had positive chest CT features and, of these, 2 (15%) were confirmed to have COVID-19. In COVID-19 patients, the most common features at admission were fatigue, fever and diarrhea [5/7 (71%) had all these]. Common laboratory features included lymphocytopenia [6/7 (86%)], elevated lactate dehydrogenase [3/4 (75%)], D-dimer [5/6 (83%)], high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [4/4 (100%)] and procalcitonin [5/5 (100%)]. Chest CT showed bilateral patchy shadows or ground-glass opacity in the lungs of all patients. Four of seven (57%) received oxygen therapy, one (14%) received noninvasive and invasive mechanical ventilation, five (71%) received antiviral and antibacterial drugs, three (43%) recieved glucocorticoid therapy and one (14%) received continuous renal replacement therapy. As the last follow-up, four of the seven patients (57%) had been discharged and three patients were dead. Conclusions: Chest CT may identify COVID-19 patients without clear symptoms, but the specificity is low. The mortality of COVID-19 patients on HD was high.","Wang, Rui; He, Hong; Liao, Cong; Hu, Hongtao; Hu, Chun; Zhang, Juan; Gao, Ping; Wu, Xiaoyan; Cheng, Zhenshun; Liao, Meiyan; Shui, Hua",Clin Kidney J,,141
440901,Hedging the Drift: Learning to Optimize under Non-Stationarity,2019-03-04,"The current COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdowns have highlighted the close and delicate relationship between a country's public health and economic health. Macroeconomic models that use preexisting epidemic models to calculate the impacts of a disease outbreak are therefore extremely useful for policymakers seeking to evaluate the best course of action in such a crisis. We develop an SIR model of the COVID-19 pandemic that explicitly considers herd immunity, behavior-dependent transmission rates, remote workers, and indirect externalities of lockdown. This model is presented as an exit time control problem where lockdown ends when the population achieves herd immunity, either naturally or via a vaccine. A social planner prescribes separate levels of lockdown for two separate sections of the adult population: low-risk (ages 20-64) and high-risk (ages 65 and over). These levels are determined via optimization of an objective function which assigns a macroeconomic cost to the level of lockdown and the number of deaths. We find that, by ending lockdowns once herd immunity is reached, high-risk individuals are able to leave lockdown significantly before the arrival of a vaccine without causing large increases in mortality. Moreover, if we incorporate a behavior-dependent transmission rate which represents increased personal caution in response to increased infection levels, both output loss and total mortality are lowered. Lockdown efficacy is further increased when there is less interaction between low- and high-risk individuals, and increased remote work decreases output losses. Overall, our model predicts that a lockdown which ends at the arrival of herd immunity, combined with individual actions to slow virus transmission, can reduce total mortality to one-third of the no-lockdown level, while allowing high-risk individuals to leave lockdown well before vaccine arrival.","Bayraktar, Erhan; Cohen, Asaf; Nellis, April",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.16389v1.pdf,141

441043,Effects of social distancing and isolation on epidemic spreading modeled via dynamical density functional theory,2020,"BackgroundTelephone consultations are already employed in specific neurological settings. At Cambridge University Hospitals, the COVID-19 pandemic initially prompted almost all face-to-face appointments to be delivered by telephone, providing a uniquely unselected population to assess. ObjectivesWe explored patient and clinician experience of telephone consultations; and whether telephone consultations might be preferable for pre-identifiable subgroups of patients after the pandemic. MethodsClinicians delivering neurological consultations converted to telephone between April-July 2020 were invited to complete a questionnaire following each consult (430 respondents) and the corresponding patients were subsequently surveyed (290 respondents). The questionnaires assessed clinician and patient goal achievement (and the reasons for any dissatisfaction). Clinicians also described consultation duration (in comparison to face-to-face) while patients detailed comparative convenience and preference. ResultsThe majority of clinicians (335/430, 78%) and patients (227/290, 78%) achieved their consultation goals by telephone, particularly during follow-up consultations (clinicians 272/329, 83%, patients 176/216, 81%) and in some disease subgroups (e.g. seizures/epilepsy (clinicians 114/122 (93%), patients 71/81 (88%)). 95% of telephone consultations were estimated to take the same or less time than an equivalent face-to-face consultation. Most patients found telephone consultations convenient (69%) with 149/211 (71%) indicating they would like telephone or video consultations to play some role in their future follow-up. ConclusionTelephone consultations appear effective, convenient and popular in prespecified subgroups of neurological outpatients. Further work comparing telephone, video and face-to-face consultations across multiple centres is now needed.","Nakornchai, Tagore; Conci, Elena; Hensiek, Anke; Brown, J William L",,,141

We state the consolidated and systematic approach for academic medical centres in response to the evolving pandemic outbreaks for sustaining medical education.Discussion: Academic medical centres need to establish a 'COVID-19 response team' in order to make time-sensitive decisions while managing pandemic threats. Major themes of medical education management include leveraging on remote or decentralised modes of medical education delivery, maintaining the integrity of formative and summative assessments while restructuring patient-contact components, and developing action plans for maintenance of essential activities based on pandemic risk alert levels. These core principles must be applied seamlessly across the various fraternities of academic centres: undergraduate education, residency training, continuous professional development and research. Key decisions from the pandemic response teams that help to minimise major disruptions in medical education and to control disease transmissions include: minimising inter-cluster cross contaminations and plans for segregation within and among cohorts; reshuffling academic calendars; postponing or restructuring assessments.Conclusions: While minimising the transmission of the pandemic outbreak within the healthcare establishments is paramount, medical education and research activities cannot come to a standstill each time there is a threat of one.","Ashokka, Balakrishnan; Ong, Say Yang; Tay, Kwang Hui; Loh, Ne Hooi Will; Gee, Chen Fun; Samarasekera, Dujeepa D",Med Teach,,141

445001,An Analysis of Blockchain Adoption in Supply Chains Between 2010 and 2020,2020-09-30,"During pandemics, minorities may experience high stress levels, which could harm their mental and physical health. However, to the best of our knowledge, this has not been examined among minorities in Israel during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study, therefore, explores stress among the Arab minority in Israel during the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak, and its association with the population's perceived COVID-19 threat, trust in the healthcare system, adherence to preventative guidelines, and perceived discrimination.The study analyzed a cross-sectional online survey of 626 Israeli Arabs. Most participants (65%) reported moderate levels of stress, and 10% reported severe levels. The Bedouin population reported significantly higher levels of stress compared to other minority groups. The participants also reported a high degree of perceived threat, a moderate-to-high level of discrimination, a moderate level of trust in the healthcare system, and very high adherence to guidelines.Hierarchical regression analysis showed that age, religion, trust in the healthcare system, perceived threat, and adherence to guidelines were all significant predictors of stress [F(11,600), p < .001]. The model explained 24% of the variance in stress. Structural equation modeling (SEM) revealed that the participants' perceived threat and trust mediated the association between their perceived discrimination and stress [indirect effect = 0.13, SE = 0.03 CI = (0.08, 0.18)], whereby discrimination was negatively associated with trust (ß = -0.52), which, in turn, was negatively associated with stress (ß = -0.10). Furthermore, discrimination was positively associated with perceived threat (ß = 0.21), which, in turn, was positively associated with stress (ß = 0.35). Discrimination is an important social determinant of health - especially during health emergencies when trust in healthcare systems and perceived threats are crucial. As such, our findings could assist policymakers in developing fair policies that are tailored to various population groups and that may reduce stress levels among minorities, thereby improving both their mental and physical health.","Satran, Carmit; Ali-Saleh, Ola; Mashiach-Eizenberg, Michal; Bord, Shiran",Ethn Health,,141

447055,Identifying Predictors of Psychological Distress During COVID-19: A Machine Learning Approach,2020,"This article focuses on the unique needs and concerns of nursing educators and nursing students in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. During social distancing, interacting with other human beings has been restricted. This would undermine the experiential learning of nursing students. Hence, it is important to develop and evaluate an experiential learning program (ELP) for nursing education. A pre-test and post-test design were used. The study was conducted in a university in Central Taiwan. A total of 103 nursing students participated in the study from February to June 2019. The study intervention was the experiential learning program (ELP), including bodily experiences and nursing activities with babies, pregnant women, and the elderly. After the intervention, the students completed the self-reflection and insight scale (SRIS) and Taiwan Critical Thinking Disposition Inventory (TCTDI) as outcome measures. An independent t-test showed that there was a significant difference between pre-test and post-test in both SRIS and TCTDI (p < 0.01).

447074,Negotiating the boundaries of China’s Belt and Road Initiative,2020,"Emerging data suggest an association between obesity and infectious diseases. Although the mechanisms underlying this link are not well established, a number of potential factors may be involved. Indeed, the obesity-related vulnerability to infectious diseases could be due to chronic low-grade inflammation, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and hyperleptinemia, which lead to a weakening of both the innate and adaptive immune responses. In addition, obesity results in anatomical-functional changes by the mechanical obstacle of excessive adipose tissue that blunt the respiratory mechanisms and predisposing to respiratory infections. Subjects with obesity are also at risk of skin folds and sweat more profusely due to the thick layers of subcutaneous fat, favoring the proliferation of microorganisms and slowing the repair of wounds down. All these factors make subjects with obesity more prone to develop nosocomial infections, surgical site, skin and soft tissue infections, bacteremia, urinary tract infections, and mycosis. Furthermore, infections in subjects with obesity have a worse prognosis, frequently prolonging hospitalization time as demonstrated for several flu viruses and recently for COVID-19. Thus, the aim of this manuscript is to provide an overview of the current clinical evidence on the associations between obesity and infectious diseases highlighting physio pathological insights involved in this link.","Muscogiuri, Giovanna; Pugliese, Gabriella; Laudisio, Daniela; Castellucci, Bianca; Barrea, Luigi; Savastano, Silvia; Colao, Annamaria",Obes Rev,,141

There are global efforts toward the development and trial of COVID-19 vaccines. However, considering the challenges and economic conditions of African nations, there could be limited access and availability of the vaccines on the continent. This will be the result of high cost and technical requirements to acquire the vaccines. There are indications that possible donor funding for COVID-19 vaccines from rich countries maybe put off considering the various challenges they face currently and the moves they are making in response to the disease. The issue of justice in health for protecting the vulnerable populations and regions also supports the need for COVID-19 vaccine availability on the African continent. Means to achieve uniform control of the disease burden across the globe should be adopted. Governments of African nations should also scale up their efforts toward COVID-19 vaccine acquisition and utilization through viable efforts. It is therefore important to assist the African continent in acquiring the COVID-19 vaccines by leveling all power dynamics that will affect access and distribution.","Lucero-Prisno, Don Eliseo; Ogunkola, Isaac Olushola; Imo, Uchenna Frank; Adebisi, Yusuff Adebayo",Am. j. trop. med. hyg,,141

This qualitative study undertaken in 2018, explores if and how sickle cell disorders become gendered in Sierra Leone through the analytical framework of a feminist ethics of care. It argues that women have to navigate moral blame when they have children with the condition. At the same time women refashion moral boundaries so that gendered norms around childhood and parenting for such children become suspended, in favour of creation of careful spaces. Parental fears of physical and sexual violence mean that gendered sexual norms are enforced for teenage boys as they are encouraged into early adulthood. In contrast, girls are kept in enforced ignorance about the consequences of sickle cell for reproduction and are encouraged to delay motherhood. This is because, as women relate, relationships and giving birth are fraught with embodied dangers and risks of violence.","Berghs, M; Dyson, S M; Gabba, A; Nyandemo, S E; Roberts, G; Deen, G",Soc Sci Med,,141

DESIGN: A single-center prospective observational study was carried out. SETTING: ICU of a tertiary care center. PATIENTS: Consecutive adults with COVID-19 admitted to the ICU. INTERVENTION: Renal replacement therapy. MAIN VARIABLES OF INTEREST: Demographic data, medical history, illness severity, type of oxygen therapy, laboratory data and use of renal replacement therapy to generate a logistic regression model describing independent risk factors for mortality. RESULTS: Of the total of 166 patients, 51% were mechanically ventilated and 26% required renal replacement therapy. The overall hospital mortality rate was 36%, versus 56% for those requiring renal replacement therapy, and 68% for those with both mechanical ventilation and renal replacement therapy. The logistic regression model identified four independent risk factors for mortality: age (adjusted OR 2.8 [95% CI 1.8-4.4] for every 10-year increase), mechanical ventilation (4.2 [1.7-10.6]), need for continuous venovenous hemofiltration (2.3 [1.3-4.0]) and C-reactive protein (1.1 [1.0-1.2] for every 10mg/L increase). CONCLUSIONS: In our cohort, acute kidney injury requiring renal replacement therapy was associated to a high mortality rate similar to that associated to the need for mechanical ventilation, while multiorgan failure necessitating both techniques implied an extremely high mortality risk.","Burke, E; Haber, E; Pike, C W; Sonti, R","Med. intensiva (Madr., Ed. impr.)",,141

450923,The Benefits of Buying Distressed Assets,2020,"A new coronavirus was recently discovered and named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Infection with SARS-CoV-2 in humans causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and has been rapidly spreading around the globe1,2. SARS-CoV-2 shows some similarities to other coronaviruses; however, treatment options and an understanding of how SARS-CoV-2 infects cells are lacking. Here we identify the host cell pathways that are modulated by SARS-CoV-2 and show that inhibition of these pathways prevents viral replication in human cells. We established a human cell-culture model for infection with a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2. Using this cell-culture system, we determined the infection profile of SARS-CoV-2 by translatome3 and proteome proteomics at different times after infection. These analyses revealed that SARS-CoV-2 reshapes central cellular pathways such as translation, splicing, carbon metabolism, protein homeostasis (proteostasis) and nucleic acid metabolism. Small-molecule inhibitors that target these pathways prevented viral replication in cells. Our results reveal the cellular infection profile of SARS-CoV-2 and have enabled the identification of drugs that inhibit viral replication. We anticipate that our results will guide efforts to understand the molecular mechanisms that underlie the modulation of host cells after infection with SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, our findings provide insights for the development of therapies for the treatment of COVID-19.","Bojkova, Denisa; Klann, Kevin; Koch, Benjamin; Widera, Marek; Krause, David; Ciesek, Sandra; Cinatl, Jindrich; Münch, Christian",Nature,,141
451129,A New Quality of Public Worker Training: Implementing a Single Information System of Management,2020,"The novel COVID-19 is a global pandemic disease overgrowing worldwide. Computer-aided screening tools with greater sensitivity is imperative for disease diagnosis and prognosis as early as possible. It also can be a helpful tool in triage for testing and clinical supervision of COVID-19 patients. However, designing such an automated tool from non-invasive radiographic images is challenging as many manually annotated datasets are not publicly available yet, which is the essential core requirement of supervised learning schemes. This article proposes a 3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based classification approach considering both the inter- and intra-slice spatial voxel information. The proposed system is trained in an end-to-end manner on the 3D patches from the whole volumetric CT images to enlarge the number of training samples, performing the ablation studies on patch size determination. We integrate progressive resizing, segmentation, augmentations, and class-rebalancing to our 3D network. The segmentation is a critical prerequisite step for COVID-19 diagnosis enabling the classifier to learn prominent lung features while excluding the outer lung regions of the CT scans. We evaluate all the extensive experiments on a publicly available dataset, named MosMed, having binary- and multi-class chest CT image partitions. Our experimental results are very encouraging, yielding areas under the ROC curve of 0.914 and 0.893 for the binary- and multi-class tasks, respectively, applying 5-fold cross-validations. Our method's promising results delegate it as a favorable aiding tool for clinical practitioners and radiologists to assess COVID-19.","Hasan, Md. Kamrul; Jawad, Md.

454737,The effects of COVID-19 on teacher preparation,2021,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Anxiety is a common emotion that people often feel in certain situations. But when the feeling of anxiety is persistent and interferes with a person's day to day life then this may likely be an anxiety disorder. Anxiety disorders are a common issue worldwide and can fall under general anxiety, panic attacks, and social anxiety among others. They can be disabling and can impact all aspects of an individual's life, including work, education, and personal relationships. It is important that people with anxiety receive appropriate care, which in some cases may prove difficult due to mental health care delivery barriers such as cost, stigma, or distance from mental health services. A potential solution to this could be mobile mental health applications. These can serve as effective and promising tools to assist in the management of anxiety and to overcome some of the aforementioned barriers. The objective of this study is to provide an analysis of treatment and management-related functionality and characteristics of high-rated mobile applications (apps) for anxiety, which are available for Android and iOS systems. METHOD: A broad search was performed in the Google Play Store and App Store following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) protocol to identify existing apps for anxiety. A set of free and highly rated apps for anxiety were identified and the selected apps were then installed and analyzed according to a predefined data extraction strategy. RESULTS: A total of 167 anxiety apps were selected (123 Android apps and 44 iOS apps). Besides anxiety, the selected apps addressed several health issues including stress, depression, sleep issues, and eating disorders. The apps adopted various treatment and management approaches such as meditation, breathing exercises, mindfulness and cognitive behavioral therapy. Results also showed that 51% of the selected apps used various gamification features to motivate users to keep using them, 32% provided social features including chat, communication with others and links to sources of help; 46% offered offline availability; and only 19% reported involvement of mental health professionals in their design. CONCLUSIONS: Anxiety apps incorporate various mental health care management methods and approaches. Apps can serve as promising tools to assist large numbers of people suffering from general anxiety or from anxiety disorders, anytime, anywhere, and particularly in the current COVID-19 pandemic.","Drissi, Nidal; Ouhbi, Sofia; Janati Idrissi, Mohammed Abdou; Ghogho, Mounir",Int J Med Inform,,141

Some HCoV strains, however, can cause fatal respiratory disease. Some examples of these diseases are severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19). This article will review the etiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and management of HCoVs. Methods: A systematic literature review was performed using the terms ""human coronaviruses"", ""MERS-CoV"", ""SARSCoV"", ""SARS-CoV2"", ""COVID-19"", and ""common cold"" in OVID MEDLINE, PubMed, and Cochrane Library. Findings: Most HCoVs cause mild upper respiratory infections which resolve with supportive care and no sequelae. In recent decades, however, there have been outbreaks of novel HCoVs that cause more severe disease. This is largely due to HCoVs having large genomes which undergo frequent recombination events, leading to the emergence of novel and more virulent strains of the virus. These severe respiratory illnesses can lead to acute respiratory distress requiring invasive intervention, such as mechanical ventilation. These severe infections can lead to long-lasting sequelae in patients. Scientists continue to investigate potential treatments for these viruses, though supportive care remains the gold standard. Scientists have succeeded in developing numerous vaccines for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and ongoing data collection and analysis will shed even more light on the next steps in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusion: Due to the frequency of recombination events and the subsequent emergence of novel strains, HCoVs are becoming more prevalent, making them a global health concern as they can lead to epidemics and pandemics. Understanding the epidemiology, etiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and management of HCoVs is important, especially during this worldwide pandemic.","Coerdt, Kathleen M; Khachemoune, Amor",Afr Health Sci,,141

METHODS: Between April 2013 and July 2019, 41 patients presenting with acute complicated (n = 29) or chronic (n = 12) descending thoracic aortic dissection were treated by the FET technique, which was the treatment of choice when supra-aortic vessel transposition would not suffice to create a satisfactory proximal landing zone for endovascular aortic repair, when a concomitant ascending or arch aneurysm was present, or in patients with connective tissue diseases. RESULTS: One patient (2%) died intra-operatively secondary to an aortic rupture in dwnstream aortic segments. No post-operative deaths occurred. Four patients (10%) suffered a non-disabling posto-operative stroke and were discharged with no clinical symptoms (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] 0, n = 1), no significant disability (mRS 1, n = 2), or with slight disability (mRS 2, n = 1). No spinal cord ischaemia was observed. The primary entry tear was either surgically resected or excluded from circulation in all patients. During follow up, one patient (2%) died after two years (not aorta related) and 16 patients (39%) underwent an aortic re-intervention after 7.7 [interquartile range 0.7, 15.8] months (endovascular aortic repair: n = 14; open thoraco-abdominal aortic replacement: n = 1, hybrid approach: n = 1). CONCLUSION: The FET technique is an effective treatment option for acute complicated and chronic Type B or non-A non-B aortic dissection in patients in whom primary endovascular aortic repair is non-feasible. While the post-operative outcome is acceptable with a relatively low incidence of non-disabling strokes, this study also underlines the considerable need for aortic re-interventions. Continuous follow up of all patients undergoing the FET procedure is essential.","Kreibich, Maximilian; Siepe, Matthias; Berger, Tim; Kondov, Stoyan; Morlock, Julia; Pingpoh, Clarence; Beyersdorf, Friedhelm; Rylski, Bartosz; Czerny, Martin",Eur. j. vasc. endovasc. surg,,141

SARS-CoV-2 mainly spreads by coughing, sneezing, droplet inhalation, and contact. SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in saliva samples, making saliva a potential transmission route for COVID-19. The participants in dental practice confront a particular risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection due to close contact with the patients and potential exposure to saliva-contaminated droplets and aerosols generated during dental procedures. In addition, saliva-contaminated surfaces could lead to potential cross-infection. Hence, the control of saliva-related transmission in the dental clinic is critical, particularly in the epidemic period of COVID-19. Based on our experience of the COVID-19 epidemic, some protective measures that can help reduce the risk of saliva-related transmission are suggested, in order to avoid the potential spread of SARS-CoV-2 among patients, visitors, and dental practitioners.","Li, Yuqing; Ren, Biao; Peng, Xian; Hu, Tao; Li, Jiyao; Gong, Tao; Tang, Boyu; Xu, Xin; Zhou, Xuedong",Mol Oral Microbiol,,141

Dietary patterns have likely changed during the COVID-19 pandemic due to major shifts and crises in social, economic, and food systems. This study examines self-reported dietary changes in Los Angeles (L.A.) County during COVID-19, and identifies factors associated with making healthy and unhealthy changes. Data are from the Understanding Coronavirus in America Study, an internet panel of adults representative of L.A. County households (N = 1080). Multinomial logistic regression was used to test if self-reported change in diet healthiness assessed in July 2020 was associated with socio-ecological factors known to be associated with diet, assessed between April-July 2020. More than half of L.A. County residents reported making changes to their diet: 28.3% reported eating healthier food since the beginning of the pandemic, while 24.8% reported eating less healthy food. Individuals who were significantly more likely to report healthy changes were Non-Hispanic Black or Hispanic/Latino (vs. Non-Hispanic White), had received unemployment insurance, or had larger social networks. Individuals who were significantly more likely to report unhealthy changes were younger, of mixed race, had children in their household, had transportation barriers, or had obesity. Individuals who were significantly more likely to report both healthy and unhealthy changes were Asian, had experienced food insecurity, or had challenges getting food due to store closures. The pandemic may be exacerbating diet-related disease risk in some groups, such as communities of color, and among individuals with obesity and those facing transportation barriers.","Miller, Sydney; Bruine de Bruin, Wandi; Livings, Michelle; Wilson, John; Weber, Kate; Frazzini, Alison; Babboni, Marianna; de la Haye, Kayla",Appetite,,141

However, its effect in men with severe oligozoospermia (SO) is less clearly elucidated. This original report and meta-analysis examined the impact of subinguinal microsurgical varicocelectomy on semen parameters and fertility outcomes of men with SO. A retrospective chart review of 85 patients was conducted on patients with SO who underwent microsurgical subinguinal varicocelectomy. A literature search was carried out according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A total of 8 studies investigating the effects of varicocele ligation in men with SO were included for the meta-analysis. The original study reported significant improvements in semen parameters following surgery. 78 patients had a pre-operative TMSC < 5 million. Following surgery, 9 (11.5%) patients had a total motile sperm count (TMSC) between 5 and 9 million, while 14 (17.9%) patients had a TMSC > 9 million. Furthermore, the meta-analysis demonstrated a statistically significant increase in sperm count, total motility and TMSC following surgery. The reported natural pregnancy rate was 27.5%. Varicocelectomy does present as an important treatment option for SO patients because improvements in TMSC can broaden their fertility treatment options.","Majzoub, Ahmad; ElBardisi, Haitham; Covarrubias, Simryn; Mak, Nicole; Agarwal, Ashok; Henkel, Ralf; ElSaid, Sami; Al-Malki, Ahmad H; Arafa, Mohamed",Andrologia,,141

465578,Will the Winner Take All? Competing Influences in Social Networks Under Information Overload,2021-04-29,"COVID-19 is a highly infectious disease where the first infected case reported in Wuhan city-China, then it was spread worldwide. The causative agent belongs to novel enveloped single linear positive-sense stranded RNA Coronavirus, which is also called SARS-CoV-2 and has an affinity to lung cells. The genetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 suggested that this novel strain may be developed from the animal. origin by recombination between a bat SARS-like CoV and a coronavirus of unknown origin. The ability of the rapid spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus from person to other is similar or even more than to other human viruses like influenza or plague leading to be announced as a pandemic by WHO in 2020. The mortality rate in SARS-CoV-2 increased day by day and this led the scientists to search for ways to control the virus. Most of the deaths in aged patients may be due to immune response complications where 70% of patients showed lymphopenia. This review provided some details about structure, pathogenicity, and immune response against SARS-CoV-2. The facts in this review lead to suggest that in most cases the death in SARS-CoV-2 may occur via loss of systemic inflammatory response control which leading to lung injury followed by pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and respiratory failure, hence the death especially in old patients. In concluding the early effective control of both innate and adaptive immunity may be a critical key factor in protection against SARS-CoV-2.","Al-Aalim, A. M.; Hamad, M. A.; Al-Ledani, A.

In fall 2020, national guidance for reopening omitted testing or screening recommendations. We report the experience of 2 large independent K-12 schools (School-A and School-B) that implemented an array of SARS-CoV-2 mitigation strategies that included periodic universal testing. METHODS: SARS-CoV-2 was identified through periodic universal PCR testing, self-reporting of tests conducted outside school, and contact tracing. Schools implemented behavioral and structural mitigation measures, including mandatory masks, classroom disinfecting, and social distancing. RESULTS: Over the fall semester, School-A identified 112 cases in 2320 students and staff; School-B identified 25 cases (2.0%) in 1400 students and staff. Most cases were asymptomatic and none required hospitalization. Of 69 traceable introductions, 63 (91%) were not associated with school-based transmission, 59 cases (54%) occurred in the 2 weeks post-thanksgiving. In 6/7 clusters, clear noncompliance with mitigation protocols was found. The largest outbreak had 28 identified cases and was traced to an off-campus party. There was no transmission from students to staff. CONCLUSIONS: Although school-age children can contract and transmit SARS-CoV-2, rates of COVID-19 infection related to in-person education were significantly lower than those in the surrounding community. However, social activities among students outside of school undermined those measures and should be discouraged, perhaps with behavioral contracts, to ensure the safety of school communities. In addition, introduction risks were highest following extended school breaks. These risks may be mitigated with voluntary quarantines and surveillance testing prior to reopening.","Gillespie, Darria L; Meyers, Lauren A; Lachmann, Michael; Redd, Stephen C; Zenilman, Jonathan M",J Sch Health,,141

Herein, we will focus on some recently studied forms of human adaptation to infectious agents, including hybridization with now-extinct hominins, such as Neanderthals and Denisovans, and admixture between modern human populations. These studies, which are partly enabled by the technological advances in the sequencing of DNA from ancient remains, provide new insight into the sources of immune response variation in contemporary humans, such as the recently reported link between Neanderthal heritage and susceptibility to severe COVID-19 disease. Furthermore, ancient DNA analyses, in both humans and pathogens, allow to measure the action of natural selection on immune genes across time and to reconstruct the impact of past epidemics on the evolution of human immunity.","Kerner, Gaspard; Patin, Etienne; Quintana-Murci, Lluis",Curr Opin Immunol,,141
467213,Reflecting on 25 Years of Teaching Animal Law: Is it Time for an International Crime of Animal Ecocide?,2020,"The COVID-19 disease, caused by Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, often results in severe hypoxemia requiring airway management. Because SARS CoV-2 virus is spread via respiratory droplets, bag-mask ventilation, intubation, and extubation may place health care workers (HCW) at risk. While existing recommendations address airway management in patients with COVID-19, no guidance exists specifically for difficult airway management. Some strategies normally recommended for difficult airway management may not be ideal in the setting of COVID-19 infection. To address this issue the Society for Airway Management (SAM) created a task force to review existing literature and current Practice Guidelines for management of the difficult airway by the American Society of Anesthesiologists Task Force on Management of the Difficult Airway. SAM task force created recommendations for management of known or suspected difficult airway in the setting of known or suspected COVID-19 infection. The goal of the task force was to optimize successful airway management while minimizing exposure risk. Each member conducted a literature review on specific clinical practice section utilizing standard search engines (PubMed, Ovid, Google Scholar). Existing recommendations and evidence for difficult airway management in COVID-19 context were developed. Each specific recommendation was discussed among task force members and modified until unanimously approved by all task force members. Elements of AGREE Reporting Checklist for dissemination of clinical practice guidelines were utilized to develop this statement. Airway management in the COVID-19 patient increases HCW exposure risk. and difficult airway management often takes longer, may involve multiple procedures with aerosolization potential, strict adherence to personal protective equipment (PPE) protocols is mandatory to reduce risk to providers. When patient's airway risk assessment suggests awake tracheal intubation is an appropriate choice of technique, procedures that may cause increased aerosolization of secretions should be avoided. Optimal preoxygenation before induction with tight seal facemask may be performed to reduce risk of hypoxemia. Unless the patient is experiencing oxygen desaturation, positive pressure bag-mask ventilation after induction may be avoided to reduce aerosolization. For optimal intubating conditions, patients should be anesthetized with full muscle relaxation. Videolaryngoscopy is recommended as first-line strategy for airway management. If emergent invasive airway access is indicated, we recommend a surgical technique such as scalpel-bougie-tube, rather than an aerosolizing generating procedure, such as transtracheal jet ventilation. This statement represents recommendations by SAM task force for the difficult airway management of adults with COVID-19 with the goal to optimize successful airway management while minimizing the risk of clinician exposure.","Foley, Lorraine J; Urdaneta, Felipe; Berkow, Lauren; Aziz, Michael F; Baker, Paul A; Jagannathan, Narasimhan; Rosenblatt, William; Straker, Tracey M; Wong, David T; Hagberg, Carin A",,,141

However, contradictory findings have been reported regarding the impact of glycaemic control on COVID-19 outcome. The aim of this meta-analysis was to explore the impact of hospital pre-admission or at-admission values of HbA1c on COVID-19 mortality or worsening in patients with diabetes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase and Scopus up to 30th December 2020. Eligibility criteria for study selection were the following: (1)enrolling patients with any form of diabetes mellitus and hospitalized for COVID-19 and (2) reporting data regarding HbA1c values before infection or at hospital admission in relation to COVID-19 mortality or worsening. Descriptive statistics, HbA1c values, odds ratios (ORs) and hazard ratios were extracted from seven observational studies and generic inverse variance (random effects) of OR was used to estimate the effect of HbA1c on COVID-19 outcome. RESULTS: HbA1c was linearly associated with an increased COVID-19 mortality or worsening when considered as a continuous variable (OR 1.01 [1.01, 1.01]; p < 0.00001). Similarly, when analysing studies providing the number of events according to the degree of glycaemic control among various strata, a significantly increased risk was observed with poor glycaemic control (OR 1.15 [1.11, 1.19]; p < 0.00001), a result corroborated by sensitivity analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Notwithstanding the large heterogeneity in study design and patients' characteristics in the few available studies, data suggest that patients with diabetes and poor glycaemic control before infection might have an increased risk of COVID-19 related mortality.","Prattichizzo, Francesco; de Candia, Paola; Nicolucci, Antonio; Ceriello, Antonio",Diabetes Metab Res Rev,,141
467799,The Dental Team: An Additional Resource for Delivering Vaccinations,2020,"Proteases precisely and irreversibly catalyze the hydrolysis of peptide bonds, regulating the fate, localization, and activity of many proteins. Consequently, proteolytic activity plays an important role in fundamental cellular processes such as differentiation and migration, immunological and inflammatory reactions, apoptosis and survival. During virus infection, host proteases are involved in several processes, from cell entry to initiation, progression and resolution of inflammation. On the other hand, many viruses encode their own highly specific proteases, responsible for the proteolytic processing of viral proteins, but, at the same time, to cleave host proteins to corrupt antiviral host responses and adjust protein activity to favor viral replication. Traditionally, protease substrate identification has been addressed by means of hypothesis-driven approaches, but recent advances in proteomics have made a toolkit available to uncover the extensive repertoire of host proteins cleaved during infection, either by viral or host proteases. Here, we review the currently available proteomics-based methods that can and have contributed to the systematic and unbiased identification of new protease substrates in the context of virus-host interactions. The role of specific proteases during the course of virus infections will also be highlighted.","Martiáñez-Vendrell, Xavier; Kikkert, Marjolein",Adv Virus Res,,141

To minimise infection risk, many people have been switched from intravenous to subcutaneous biologics including biosimilars. DESIGN: The survey was designed to understand comparative economic issues related to the intravenous infusion vs subcutaneous biologic administration routes for infliximab. The survey focused on direct cost drivers/indirect cost drivers. Acquisition costs of medicines were not included due to data not being available publicly. Wider policy implications linked to the pandemic were also explored. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Semi structured single telephone interviews were carried out with twenty key stakeholders across the National Health Service(NHS) from 35clinical/42pharmacy/28commissioning roles. The interviews were undertaken virtually during April 2020 From interview(n=20) results a simple cost analysis was developed plus a qualitative analysis of reports on wider policy/patient impacts. RESULTS: Key findings included evidence of significant variation in local infusion tariffs UK wide, with interviewees reporting that not all actual costs incurred are captured in published tariff costs. A cost analysis showed administration costs 50% lower in the subcutaneous compared to infusion routes, with most patients administering subcutaneous medicines themselves. Other indirect benefits to this route included less pressure on infusion unit waiting times/reduced risk of COVID-19 infection plus reduced patient 'out of pocket' costs. However, this was to some extent offset by increased pressure on home-care and community/primary care services. CONCLUSIONS: Switching from infusion to subcutaneous routes is currently driven by the COVID-19 pandemic in many services. A case for biologics (infusion vs subcutaneous) must be made on accurate real-world economic analysis. In an analysis of direct/indirect costs, excluding medicine acquisition costs, subcutaneous administration appears to be the more cost saving option for many patients even without the benefit of industry funded home-care.","Heald, Adrian; Bramham-Jones, Steven; Davies, Mark",Int J Clin Pract,,141

472457,Guest editorial,2021,"OBJECTIVE: The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically changed health care, forcing providers to adopt and implement telehealth technology to provide continuous care for their patients. Amid this rapid transition from in-person to remote visits, differences in telehealth utilization have arisen among neurosurgical subspecialties. In this study, we analyze the impact of telehealth on neurosurgical healthcare delivery during the COVID-19 pandemic at our institution and highlight differences in telehealth utilization across different neurosurgical subspecialties. METHODS: To quantify differences in telehealth utilization, we analyzed all outpatient neurosurgery visits at a single academic institution. Internal surveys were administered to neurosurgeons and to patients to determine both physician and patient satisfaction with telehealth visits. Patient Likelihood-to-Recommend Press-Ganey scores were also evaluated. RESULTS: There was a decrease in outpatient visits during the COVID-19 pandemic in all neurosurgical subspecialties. Telehealth adoption was higher in spine, tumor, and interventional pain than in functional, peripheral nerve, or vascular neurosurgery. Neurosurgeons agreed that telehealth was an efficient (92%) and effective (85%) methodology; however, they noted it was more difficult to evaluate and bond with patients. The majority of patients were satisfied with their video visits and would recommend video visits over in-person visits. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, neurosurgical subspecialties varied in adoption of telehealth, which may be due to the specific nature of each subspecialty and their necessity to perform in-person evaluations. Telehealth visits will likely continue after the pandemic as they can improve clinical efficiency; overall, both patients and physicians are satisfied with health care delivery over video.","Leung, Christopher; Wadhwa, Harsh; Sklar, Matthew; Sheth, Kunj; Loo, Sophia; Ratliff, John; Zygourakis, Corinna C",World neurosurgery (Online),,141

473716,Continuing Education,2021,"Introduction: as COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly evolving, there is a whole reorganization in hospitals to concentrate more resources to face the crisis. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 disease on urological activity in Tunisia. To assess the differences in the management of urological conditions between the private and the public field. Methods: a survey was addressed to all certified urologists working in Tunisia in both the public and private sectors (n=194) using the national database of active urologists available and updated. We either called them or looked them up through email or social media. The form was open from March the 28th to April the 3rd. Results were obtained via spreadsheet and analysed using SPSS 23.0. Results: one hundred and twenty urologists have filled in the form. Consultations at the outpatient office were restricted to urgent cases in 66% (n=79). Telemedicine was more used by urologists in private than in public fields p=0.03. Urologists in private sector followed more the sterilization protocol of the hospital/clinic and used more disposable materials whenever possible p=0.011. Elective surgical activity has completely stopped in 85% of the responders (n=102). Elective surgery requiring transfusion or intensive care unit was performed in 38% (n=46) and 26% (n=31) if there was a risk of disease progression. Benign Prostate Hyperplasia (BPH) surgery was more performed as usual in private sector than in public sector p=0.012. It was the only condition managed differently between both sectors. Conclusion: the drop of the urological activity is essential in order to give relevant stakeholders room to act efficiently against the spread of the virus. The context of the pandemic and the hospital´s condition must be taken into consideration without compromising the patient´s outcome.","Zouari, Skander; Saadi, Ahmed; Chakroun, Marouene; Oueslati, Amine; Fliss, Maroua; Bouzouita, Abderrazek; Derouiche, Amine; Slama, Riadh Ben; Ayed, Haroun; Chebil, Mohamed",Pan Afr Med J,,141

475024,Determinants of Sustainability Reporting in the Present Institutional Context: The Case of Port Managing Bodies,2021,"The correlation between SARS-CoV-2 and oral manifestations is still controversial. The aim of this observational study was to determine the oral manifestation of the hospitalized patients for COVID-19. A total of 20 patients met the inclusion criteria and gave their signed informed consent. A questionnaire of 32 questions regarding the oral and systemic health condition was administrated to these patients during the convalescence. A descriptive statistic was performed. Data were analysed through the use of &#967;2 test, to assess the statistical significance. A statistically significant increase of about 30% of reporting xerostomia during hospitalization was observed (p = 0.02). Meanwhile, a decrease of oral hygiene was observed during the hospitalization, even if a non-statistically significant difference was shown between the two study time points (before and after hospitalization). During the hospitalization period, 25% of patients reported impaired taste, 15% burning sensation, and 20% difficulty in swallowing. An interesting result was that among the systemic conditions, hypertension was observed in 39% of patients and mostly in female patients (62.5%). Further studies are necessary to better understand the symptoms of this new virus in order to faster detect its presence in humans. Probably, a multidisciplinary team following the COVID-19 patients could be of key importance in treating this disease.","Sinjari, Bruna; D039,; Ardes, Damiano; Santilli, Manlio; Rexhepi, Imena; Addazio, Gianmaria; Di Carlo, Piero; Chiacchiaretta, Piero; Caputi, Sergio; Cipollone, Francesco",,,141
475252,The Economy Beyond the Tipping Point: Crisis and Opportunity for Renewal,2020,"Purpose The authors explore the Australian Government's implementation of budgetary measures to manage the social and economic impacts of COVID-19, paying particular attention to how the country's history of inequality has shaped these actions, and the effect inequality may have on outcomes. Design/methodology/approach In this qualitative case study of public budgeting, the authors draw on the latest research into inequality to consider the implications of policy responses to COVID-19 in Australia. In particular, we examine the short-term introduction of what we term ""people-focused"" budgetary measures. These appeared contrary to the dominant neoliberalist approach to Australian welfare policymaking. Findings This paper foregrounds the relationship between budgeting, public policy and inequality and explores how decades of increasingly regressive tax systems and stagnating living wages have made both people, and the state, vulnerable to crises like COVID. Social implications There is still much to learn about the role of accounting in the shaping of growing economic inequality. In focusing on public budgeting within the context of COVID, the authors suggest ways accounting researchers can contribute to our understanding of economic inequality, both in terms of drivers and consequences. The authors hope to contribute to a growing body of accounting research that can influence social movements, political debates and policymaking, while also raising awareness of the consequences of wealth and income inequality. Originality/value The authors explore ways accounting scholars might help articulate a post-COVID future that avoids recreating the inequalities of the past and present.","Andrew, J.; Baker, M.; Guthrie, J.",Accounting Auditing &amp; Accountability Journal,,141

A key concern are neurological and long-term cognitive complications. At the same time, the prevalence and nature of the cognitive sequalae of COVID-19 are unclear. The present study aimed to investigate the frequency, pattern and severity of cognitive impairments 3-4 months after COVID-19 hospital discharge, their relation to subjective cognitive complaints, quality of life and illness variables. We recruited patients at their follow-up visit at the respiratory outpatient clinic, Copenhagen University Hospital, Bispebjerg, approximately four months after hospitalisation with COVID-19. Patients underwent pulmonary, functional and cognitive assessments. Twenty-nine patients were included. The percentage of patients with clinically significant cognitive impairment ranged from 59% to 65% depending on the applied cut-off for clinical relevance of cognitive impairment, with verbal learning and executive functions being most affected. Objective cognitive impairment scaled with subjective cognitive complaints, lower work function and poorer quality of life. Cognitive impairments were associated with d-dimer levels during acute illness and residual pulmonary dysfunction. In conclusion, these findings provide new evidence for frequent cognitive sequelae of COVID-19 and indicate an association with the severity of the lung affection and potentially restricted cerebral oxygen delivery. Further, the associations with quality of life and functioning call for systematic cognitive screening of patients after recovery from severe COVID-19 illness and implementation of targeted treatments for patients with persistent cognitive impairments.","Miskowiak, K W; Johnsen, S; Sattler, S M; Nielsen, S; Kunalan, K; Rungby, J; Lapperre, T; Porsberg, C M",Eur Neuropsychopharmacol,,141
478717,Doing nothing does something: Embodiment and data in the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"Over the past decade, pandemics caused by pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) influenza virus in 2009 and severe acute respiratory syndrome virus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in 2019 have emerged. Both are high-impact respiratory pathogens originating from animals. Their wide distribution in the human population subsequently results in an increased risk of human-to-animal transmission: reverse zoonosis. Although there have only been rare reports of reverse zoonosis events associated with the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic from SARS-CoV-2 so far, comparison with the pH1N1 influenza pandemic can provide a better understanding of the possible consequences of such events for public and animal health. The results of our review suggest that similar factors contribute to successful crossing of the host species barriers in both pandemics. Specific risk factors include sufficient interaction between infected humans and recipient animals, suitability of the animal host factors for productive virus infection, and suitability of the animal host population for viral persistence. Of particular concern is virus spread to susceptible animal species, in which group housing and contact network structure could potentially result in an alternative virus reservoir, from which reintroduction into humans can take place. Virus exposure in high-density populations could allow sustained transmission in susceptible animal species. Identification of the risk factors and serological surveillance in SARS-CoV-2-susceptible animal species that are group-housed should help reduce the threat from reverse zoonosis of COVID-19.","Sooksawasdi Na Ayudhya, Syriam; Kuiken, Thijs",Vet Pathol,,141
478731,Resilience of Spanish forests to recent droughts and climate change,2020,"INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 is a highly infectious respiratory disease that rapidly emerged as an unprecedented epidemic in Europe, with a primary hotspot in Northern Italy during the first months of 2020. Its high infection rate and rapid spread contribute to set the risk for relevant psychological stress in citizens. In this context, mother-infant health is at risk not only because of potential direct exposure to the virus but also due to high levels of stress experienced by mothers from conception to delivery. Prenatal stress exposure associates with less-than-optimal child developmental outcomes, and specific epigenetic mechanisms (eg, DNA methylation) may play a critical role in mediating this programming association. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We present the methodological protocol for a longitudinal, multicentric study on the behavioural and epigenetic effects of COVID-19-related prenatal stress in a cohort of mother-infant dyads in Northern Italy. The dyads will be enrolled at 10 facilities in Northern Italy. Saliva samples will be collected at birth to assess the methylation status of specific genes linked with stress regulation in mothers and newborns. Mothers will provide retrospective data on COVID-19-related stress during pregnancy. At 3, 6 and 12 months, mothers will provide data on child behavioural and socioemotional outcomes, their own psychological status (stress, depressive and anxious symptoms) and coping strategies. At 12 months, infants and mothers will be videotaped during semistructured interaction to assess maternal sensitivity and infant's relational functioning. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study was approved by the Ethics Committee (Pavia). Results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at national and international scientific conferences.

More rarely, COVID-19 can be complicated by hemodynamic failure due to fulminant myocarditis or massive pulmonary embolism necessitating the implantation of venous-arterial ECMO. The management of ECMO during the COVID-19 pandemic is challenging due to some specificities related to the disease characteristics, such as the management of anticoagulation in patients with a hypercoagulable state and an increased risk of venous thromboembolism. In large retrospective cohorts, survival of ECMO-rescued COVID-19 patients with ADRS was reported to be similar to that reported in previous studies on ECMO support for severe ARDS.

However, little is known about their lived experience and related meaning-making. This qualitative study maps COVID-19-related experiences among respondents from three migrant groups living in Finland: Somali-, Arabic- and Russian-speakers (N = 209). The data were collected by telephone interviews over four weeks in March and April 2020. Using inductive thematic analysis, we identified seven themes that illustrate respondents' multifaceted lived experiences during the first phase of pandemic. The themes depict respondents' difficulties and fears, but also their resilience and resources to cope, both individually and collectively. Experiences varied greatly between individuals and migrant groups. The main conclusion is that although the COVID-19 pandemic may be an especially stressful experience for migrant populations, it may also provide opportunities to deepen cooperation and trust within migrant communities, and between migrants and their country of settlement. Our analysis suggests that cooperation between local authorities and migrants, trust-building and effective information-sharing can foster positive and functional adaptations to disease-related threats and changing social environments.","Finell, Eerika; Tiilikainen, Marja; Jasinskaja-Lahti, Inga; Hasan, Nasteho; Muthana, Fairuz",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,141

480826,Two Superpandemics for One Humanity Is Too Many!,2020,"In early February of 2020, attention was drawn to the increased number of deaths and the new cases of coronavirus infection. The epicentre of the outbreak was Wuhan in the People's Republic of China. In order to control the outbreak, Chinese leaders called on the city authorities in Wuhan to set up mass quarantine centres for infected people. The Chinese government took this step to protect the public against infectious disease. This is an example of the conflicts between public health and civil liberties/individual rights. Government authority is the pillar of the public health law. The government retains the power to achieve and maintain common good by restricting - within solid international and national limits - individual rights concerning autonomy, privacy, association, and liberty. Public health agencies have the right to collect, use, and disclose a considerable amount of personal health information and to enforce certain vaccinations, medical examinations, and treatments. In addition to the power to isolate individuals to protect the public against the spread of infectious disease, their powers can be used to control businesses and professions. There are several legal interventions to prevent injury and disease and promote the public's health. Among these tools are taxing policies, which encourage engaging in beneficial behaviour (fruit consumption) and disincentives to engage in high-risk activities (smoking).","Onisoyonivosekume, Dede; Mahrouseh, Nour; Varga, Orsolya",Stud Health Technol Inform,,141

482870,Quantifying Contributions of Local Emissions and Regional Transport to NOX in Beijing Using TROPOMI Constrained WRF-Chem Simulation,2021,"Starting from December 2019 the world has faced an unprecedented health crisis caused by the new Coronavirus (COVID-19) due to the SARS-CoV-2 pathogen. Within this topic, the aim of the paper was to quantify the effect of mobility habits in the spread of the Coronavirus in Italy through a multiple linear regression model. Estimation results showed that mobility habits represent one of the variables that explains the number of COVID-19 infections jointly with the number of tests/day and some environmental variables (i.e. PM pollution and temperature). Nevertheless, a proximity variable to the first outbreak was also significant, meaning that the areas close to the outbreak had a higher risk of contagion, especially in the initial stage of infection (time-decay phenomena). Furthermore, the number of daily new cases was related to the trips performed three weeks before. This threshold of 21â¯days could be considered as a sort of positivity detection time, meaning that the mobility restrictions quarantine commonly set at 14â¯days, defined only according to incubation-based epidemiological considerations, is underestimated (possible delays between contagion and detection) as a containment policy and may not always contribute to effectively slowing down the spread of virus worldwide. This result is original and, if confirmed in other studies, will lay the groundwork for more effective containment of COVID-19 in countries that are still in the health emergency, as well as for possible future returns of the virus.","Cartenì, Armando; Di Francesco, Luigi; Martino, Maria",Sci Total Environ,,141

483443,An international football match experienced from within a 'working quarantine' – a photographic journey,2021,"The rapid early spread of COVID-19 in the US was experienced very differently by different socioeconomic groups and business industries. In this study, we study aggregate mobility patterns of New York City and Chicago to identify the relationship between the amount of interpersonal contact between people in urban neighborhoods and the disparity in the growth of positive cases among these groups. We introduce an aggregate spatiotemporal contact density index (CDI) to measure the strength of this interpersonal contact using mobility data collected from mobile phones, and combine it with social distancing metrics to show its effect on positive case growth. With the help of structural equations modeling, we find that the effect of CDI on case growth was consistently positive and that it remained consistently higher in lower-income neighborhoods, suggesting a causal path of income on case growth via CDI. Using the CDI, schools and restaurants are identified as high contact density industries, and the estimation suggests that implementing specific mobility restrictions on these point-of-interest categories is most effective. This analysis can be useful in providing insights for government officials targeting specific population groups and businesses to reduce infection spread as reopening efforts continue to expand across the nation.","Verma, Rajat; Yabe, Takahiro; Ukkusuri, Satish V",Sci Rep,,141

485594,The digital transformation of preventive telemedicine in France based on the use of connected wearable devices,2020,"The current disruptive and abrupt transition to remote activities that educational institutions are facing represents a major challenge for the entire academic community. While most concerns have centred on how learning activities may successfully transit from face-to-face to remote delivery, little attention has been given to how educators can be supported in this new unchartered territory. In this article, we discuss the crucial role of team leaders and how their management and leadership style may have great potential to support educators' motivation. Based on Self-determination Theory, we offer a framework through which team leaders may contribute to create optimal remote working environments for educators. We argue that educators' autonomous motivation depends on how they perceive their remote work environment as supportive of their basic psychological needs of autonomy, competence and relatedness. Then, we highlight a series of practical recommendations by which team leaders may be more needs-supportive. Working from home requires space, trust, open communication and flexibility, especially considering that team members may have different clinical or personal circumstances. We therefore hope these suggestions are helpful to cultivate educators' autonomous motivation, which is beneficial not only for themselves but also for others in their institution, including their co-workers and students.","Orsini, Cesar; Rodrigues, Veena",Med Teach,,141

A dilemma for small retailer entrepreneurs and its resolution,2021,"The spread of the emerging pathogen, named as SARS-CoV-2, has led to an unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic since 1918 influenza pandemic. This review first sheds light on the similarity on global transmission, surges of pandemics, and the disparity of prevention between two pandemics. Such a brief comparison also provides an insight into the potential sequelae of COVID-19 based on the inference drawn from the fact that a cascade of successive influenza pandemic occurred after 1918 and also the previous experience on the epidemic of SARS and MERS occurring in 2003 and 2015, respectively. We then propose a systematic framework for elucidating emerging infectious disease (EID) such as COVID-19 with a panorama viewpoint from natural infection and disease process, public health interventions (non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) and vaccine), clinical treatments and therapies (antivirals), until global aspects of health and economic loss, and economic evaluation of interventions with emphasis on mass vaccination. This review not only concisely delves for evidence-based scientific literatures from the origin of outbreak, the spread of SARS-CoV-2 to three surges of pandemic, and NPIs and vaccine uptakes but also provides a new insight into how to apply big data analytics to identify unprecedented discoveries through COVID-19 pandemic scenario embracing from biomedical to economic viewpoints.","Chen, Chi-Ling; Lai, Chao-Chih; Luh, Dih-Ling; Chuang, Shao-Yuan; Yang, Kuen-Cheh; Yeh, Yen-Po; Ming-Fang Yen, Amy; Chang, King-Jen; Chang, Ray-E; Li-Sheng Chen, Sam",J Formos Med Assoc,,141
485653,The returns on government and corporate securities with prices propped up by central bank purchases using unlimited quantities of currencies with less intrinsic value than toilet paper,2020,"BACKGROUND: Accurate molecular diagnostic tests are necessary for confirming a diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Direct detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleic acids in respiratory tract specimens informs patient, healthcare institution and public health level decision-making. The numbers of available SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection tests are rapidly increasing, as is the COVID-19 diagnostic literature. Thus, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recognized a significant need for frequently updated systematic reviews of the literature to inform evidence-based best practice guidance. OBJECTIVE: The IDSA's goal was to develop an evidence-based diagnostic guideline to assists clinicians, clinical laboratorians, patients and policymakers in decisions related to the optimal use of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification tests. In addition, we provide a conceptual framework for understanding molecular diagnostic test performance, discuss the nuance of test result interpretation in a variety of practice settings, and highlight important unmet research needs in the COVID-19 diagnostic testing space. METHODS: IDSA convened a multidisciplinary panel of infectious diseases clinicians, clinical microbiologists, and experts in systematic literature review to identify and prioritize clinical questions and outcomes related to the use of SARS-CoV-2 molecular diagnostics. Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was used to assess the certainty of evidence and make testing recommendations. RESULTS: The panel agreed on 15 diagnostic recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: Universal access to accurate SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing is critical for patient care, hospital infection prevention and the public response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Information on the clinical performance of available tests is rapidly emerging, but the quality of evidence of the current literature is considered low to very low. Recognizing these limitations, the IDSA panel weighed available diagnostic evidence and recommends nucleic acid testing for all symptomatic individuals suspected of having COVID-19. In addition, testing is recommended for asymptomatic individuals with known or suspected contact with a COVID-19 case. Testing asymptomatic individuals without known exposure is suggested when the results will impact isolation/quarantine/personal protective equipment (PPE) usage decisions, dictate eligibility for surgery, or inform administration of immunosuppressive therapy. Ultimately, prioritization of testing will depend on institutional-specific resources and the needs of different patient populations.","Hanson, Kimberly E; Caliendo, Angela M; Arias, Cesar A; Englund, Janet A; Lee, Mark J; Loeb, Mark; Patel, Robin; El Alayli, Abdallah; Kalot, Mohamad A; Falck-Ytter, Yngve; Lavergne, Valery; Morgan, Rebecca L; Murad, M Hassan; Sultan, Shahnaz; Bhimraj, Adarsh; Mustafa, Reem A",Clin. infect. dis,,141

486279,Developments in International and European Law,2020,"The situation associated with the growing number of Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections forced ongoing monitoring of the epidemic situation, which entailed an introduction of a number of restrictions and solutions intended to isolate the infected persons on the one hand, and to minimize the risk of development of an epidemic in Poland on the other. Activity of the Polish legislator is also essential, which tried to introduce solutions that would correspond with current expectations and needs. Given the multiplicity of the introduced regulations, interpretation of provisions of statutes has not always been easy. In this paper, the author points to the issues of communication with a public authority by specific reflections on the principles of serving documents on beneficiaries of EU programs under which they were awarded funding for their implementation on the basis of EU regulations addressing the use of the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund for programs implemented as part of the cohesion policy (Regulations of the European Parliament and of the Council (EU) of 17 December 2013: no. 1303/2013, no. 1301/2013, no. 1304/2013, no 1300/2013, and no. 1299/2013). The author focuses on the issues of communication with an authority in a situation where administrative proceedings are initiated against a beneficiary of EU funds, e.g., for returning the granted funding. The author points to the dynamics of the legislator's work in this respect by analyzing the rules for serving documents by a public authority on beneficiaries who are public entities and those who are not. The author's main research aim is to analyze existing provisions establishing the possibility of electronic communication with a public authority, and also to assess them critically due to the extraordinary situation caused by Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). This is intended to verify the main research hypothesis focusing on the attempt to answer a question whether existing regulations, and those created at the time of the epidemic threat and the state of epidemic in Poland facilitate citizens' electronic communication with a public authority. The author aims to answer a question about whether the Polish legislator responds appropriately to the numerous emerging challenges associated with the pandemic and whether it created regulations that effectively ensure the possibility of continuity of contact with a public authority for citizens who are the beneficiaries of public funds. This analysis may contribute to the understanding of whether and how it is possible to improve citizens' contact with public authorities, which in the future may eliminate barriers and obstacles arising in this regard. The author bases her reflections on the experience resulting from providing legal services for one of the Polish Managing Authorities of the Regional Operational Programme using at the same time a number of research methods (i.e., the method of interpretation of applicable laws to establish applicable provisions of the law that regulate admissibility of electronic communication with a public authority and to establish efficiency of such communication, the analytical method, applied in reference to the relevant state of the art in the achievements of legal scholarship, and the empirical method, based on observation and analysis of practical issues resulting from the author's cooperation with a Polish managing authority). In her conclusions, the author points to the lack of introduction of comprehensive regulations (also at the EU level-for all EU Member States) in terms of de-formalizing the principles of communication in the course of pending administrative proceedings. The author notices an absence of unambiguous regulations that allow for a scanned document signed by hand and sent my email to be qualified into the category of documents served by electronic means, through use of means of electronic communication. The author assesses this absence negatively due to the fact that such action seems the simplest in a situation caused by COVID-19.","Klich, Aleksandra",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,141

In this research, we are interested in analyzing the existing data to predict the number of infected people in the second wave of out-breaking COVID-19 in Iran. For this purpose, a model is proposed. The mathematical analysis corresponded to the model is also included in this paper. Based on proposed numerical simulations, several scenarios of progress of COVID-19 corresponding to the second wave of the disease in the coming months, will be discussed.

This study aimed to assess the prevalence of the most common neurological symptoms and comorbidities and systematically review the literature regarding the most prevalent neurological complications of COVID-19 infection. METHODS: All relevant studies had been collected from PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Web of Science databases. All extracted data were analyzed using Stata version 11.2. The I2 index was applied, and a random-effects model or a fixed-effects model was used for pooled estimation to assess the heterogeneity of studies. Furthermore, Egger and Beeg's tests were used to evaluate the publication bias. RESULTS: Fifty-seven studies (26 observational and 31 case reports) were included (including 6,597 COVID-19 patients). The most prevalent general symptoms were fever, cough, and dyspnea with 84.6% (95% CI: 75.3-92.1; I2 = 98.7%), 61.3% (95% CI: 55.3-67.0; I2 = 94.6%), and 34.2% (95% CI: 25.6-43.4; I2 = 97.7%), respectively. Neurological symptoms observed among COVID-19 patients were fatigue, gustatory dysfunction, anorexia, olfactory dysfunction, headache, dizziness, and nausea with 42.9% (95% CI: 36.7-49.3; I2 = 92.8%), 35.4% (95% CI: 11.2-64.4; I2 = 99.2%), 28.9% (95% CI: 19.9-38.8; I2 = 96.3%), 25.3% (95% CI: 1.6-63.4; I2 = 99.6%), 10.1% (95% CI: 2.7-21.0; I2 = 99.1%), 6.7% (95% CI: 3.7-10.5; I2 = 87.5%), and 5.9% (95% CI: 3.1-9.5; I2 = 94.5%). The most prevalent neurological comorbidity in COVID-19 was cerebrovascular disease with 4.3% (95% CI: 2.7-6.3; I2 = 78.7%). CONCLUSION: The most prevalent neurological manifestations of COVID-19 include fatigue, gustatory dysfunction, anorexia, olfactory dysfunction, headache, dizziness, and nausea. Cerebrovascular disorders can either act as a risk factor for poorer prognosis in COVID-19 patients or occur as a critical complication in these patients. Guillain-Barre syndrome, encephalitis, and meningitis have also been reported as complications of COVID-19.","Vakili, Kimia; Fathi, Mobina; Hajiesmaeili, Mohammadreza; Salari, Melika; Saluja, Diksha; Tafakhori, Abbas; Sayehmiri, Fatemeh; Rezaei-Tavirani, Mostafa",Eur Neurol,,141

The goal of this study is to assess SE of PGY5 residents for common general surgery operations. We hypothesize there are deficits in SE of PGY5 residents, and SE of a given operation correlates with 1) experience performing the operation without attending assistance (independently) and/or 2) teaching the operation start-to-finish. METHODS: A survey was linked to the 2020 ABSITE. From the ACGME case log's 15 most commonly performed surgeon-chief operations and AHRQ's 15 most common operations, 10 operations were selected. Residents evaluated their ability to perform these operations independently using a 5-point SE scale. Residents were asked if they had experience performing these operations independently and/or teaching the operation start-to-finish. Descriptive statistics and Pearson correlation were used to examine the relationship between SE and operative experience. RESULTS: 1145 of 1367 (84%) PGY5 residents responded. Highest SE was in performing wide-local excision (90.24%) and the lowest in performing open thyroidectomy (19.58%) (Table 1). Eighty-eight (7.7%) reported SE in all procedures. Statistically significant positive correlations were identified between experience and SE for cases performed without assistance (r = 0.98, p<0.01) and cases taught (r = 0.91, p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: With 5 months left in training, 92.3% of residents report deficits in preparation for practice as defined by SE to complete common procedures independently. Resident SE increased in direct relation to performed cases and cases taught.","Anderson, Tiffany N; Payne, Davis H; Dent, Daniel L; Kearse, LaDonna E; Schmiederer, Ingrid S; Korndorffer, James R",J.

492693,The rise in climate change-induced federal fishery disasters in the United States,2021,"The novel COVID-19 outbreak has affected more than 200 countries and territories as of March 2020. Given that patients with cancer are generally more vulnerable to infections, systematic analysis of diverse cohorts of patients with cancer affected by COVID-19 is needed. We performed a multicenter study including 105 patients with cancer and 536 age-matched noncancer patients confirmed with COVID-19. Our results showed COVID-19 patients with cancer had higher risks in all severe outcomes. Patients with hematologic cancer, lung cancer, or with metastatic cancer (stage IV) had the highest frequency of severe events. Patients with nonmetastatic cancer experienced similar frequencies of severe conditions to those observed in patients without cancer. Patients who received surgery had higher risks of having severe events, whereas patients who underwent only radiotherapy did not demonstrate significant differences in severe events when compared with patients without cancer. These findings indicate that patients with cancer appear more vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. SIGNIFICANCE: Because this is the first large cohort study on this topic, our report will provide much-needed information that will benefit patients with cancer globally. As such, we believe it is extremely important that our study be disseminated widely to alert clinicians and patients.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 747.","Dai, Mengyuan; Liu, Dianbo; Liu, Miao; Zhou, Fuxiang; Li, Guiling; Chen, Zhen; Zhang, Zhian; You, Hua; Wu, Meng; Zheng, Qichao; Xiong, Yong; Xiong, Huihua; Wang, Chun; Chen, Changchun; Xiong, Fei; Zhang, Yan; Peng, Yaqin; Ge, Siping; Zhen, Bo; Yu, Tingting; Wang, Ling; Wang, Hua; Liu, Yu; Chen, Yeshan; Mei, Junhua; Gao, Xiaojia; Li, Zhuyan; Gan, Lijuan; He, Can; Li, Zhen; Shi, Yuying; Qi, Yuwen; Yang, Jing; Tenen, Daniel G; Chai, Li; Mucci, Lorelei A; Santillana, Mauricio; Cai, Hongbing",Cancer Discov,,141

It is a global public health concern that causes rapid growth in the number of patients with significant mortality rates. The first case in Sudan was reported in the 13-March 2020, and up to 3 July 2020, there are 9894 confirmed cases, and 616 deaths. The case fatality rate was 6.23%; There is variation in case fatality rate (CFR) in some cities (like Khartoum) was low (3.8 %), while in others like North Darfur, it was very high (31.7%). The government of Sudan has implemented preventive measures during the current coronavirus disease pandemic, such as partial lock-down, contact monitoring, risk communication, social distance, quarantine, and isolation to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 virus. However, there are new community cases every day; this could be as a result of the weak application of these measures by the government, and the lack of commitment of people to these measures. The number of COVID-19 cases is currently decreasing in Sudan, but we are expected to see an increase in numbers of cases as a result of the massive demonstrations that occurred in Sudan recently, and as a result of the expected reopening and restoring normal life. Therefore, the government must increase the testing facilities, maintain the social distancing, and necessary precautions to limit the spread of infection after life returns to normal.","Altayb, Hisham N; Eldeen Altayeb, Nassma Mohy; Hamadalnil, Yassir; Elsayid, Mohieldin; Mahmoud, Neama Esmat",New Microbes New Infect,,141

An extraction control, that allows monitoring of the extraction procedure and PCR inhibition, is included. OBJECTIVE: In-silico analysis and wet testing showed inclusivity and exclusivity of the assay. The complete workflow starting from surface swabbing (VIRSeek PATHOSwab kit), RNA extraction (VIRSeek RNAExtractor), RT-PCR (VIRSeek SARS-CoV-2 Mplex) and evaluation with FastFinder was validated in comparison to the CDC method for detection of SARS-CoV-2 on stainless steel. METHODS: In-silico analysis was performed by using the MFOLD online program. The matrix study was performed for stainless steel inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 isolated from the first documented US case of a traveler from Wuhan, China. RESULTS: For inclusivity, 15,764 sequences were analyzed and all mismatches (0.37% of the sequences had single mismatches) were considered non-critical. Cross reactivity for closely related viruses and background organisms was performed, resulting in correct exclusion of all. No significant differences were observed for the POD study when comparing to the CDC method. CONCLUSIONS: Results of the inclusivity and exclusivity study show that the assay is specific for detection SARS-CoV-2. The POD study showed no statistically significant difference compared to the CDC reference method, results were identical for the uninoculated and the high level. For the fractional recovery level, the candidate method detected 9/17 samples leading to a POD of 0.47, the reference method detected 11/20 samples leading to a POD of 0.55.","Bleichner, Laura; Bleicher, Vera; Göhring, Nadine; Kleiboeker, Steven B",J.

However, the molecular mechanism of action of IVM on A. simplex s.s. remains unknown. Herein, tandem mass tag (TMT) labeling and extensive liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis were used to identify the effect of IVM on the proteome of A. simplex s.s. in vitro. During the study, 3433 proteins, of which 1247 had at least two protein unique peptides, were identified. Comparative proteomics analysis revealed that 59 proteins were differentially regulated (DRPs) in IVM-treated larvae, of which 14 proteins were upregulated and 38 were downregulated after 12 h of culture, but after 24 h, 12 proteins were upregulated and 22 were downregulated. The transcription level of five randomly selected DRPs was determined by real-time PCR as a supplement to the proteomic data. The functional enrichment analysis showed that most of the DRPs were involved in oxidoreductase activity, immunogenicity, protein degradation, and other biological processes. This study has, for the first time, provided comprehensive proteomics data on A. simplex s.s. response to IVM and might deliver new insight into the molecular mechanism by which IVM acts on invasive larvae of A. simplex s.s.","Polak, Iwona; Lopienska-Biernat, Elzbieta; Stryinski, Robert; Mateos, Jesús; Carrera, Mónica",,,141

Plotting mortality and diagnosis rates against medical staff resources in 16 cities in Hubei Province, where the epidemic was initially concerned and the most severe, shows a significant negative correlation, indicating the critical role of medical staff resources in controlling epidemics. Nevertheless, it is difficult to ensure that there exist enough medical personnel in cities severely hit by the outbreak. China provides solutions by adopting nationwide ""pairing assistance"" measures with at least one province assisting one city to alleviate pressure in the most severe area. By plotting the number of patients receiving treatment against day, it is clear that implementing ""pairing assistance"" is a turning point in China's fight against epidemics.","Chen, Tianxiang; Wang, Ying; Hua, Lei",Int J Equity Health,,141

AIMS: We designed the study to evaluate the association of sociodemographic and comorbidities with the prognosis of adverse health outcomes in patients with COVID-19 in Bangladesh. METHODS: A multivariate retrospective cohort study was conducted on data from 966 RT-PCR positive patients from eight divisions during December 13, 2020, to February 13, 2021. Variables included sociodemographic, comorbidities, symptoms, Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) and access to health facilities. Major outcome was fatality. Secondary outcomes included hospitalization, duration of hospital stay, requirement of mechanical ventilation and severity. RESULTS: Male (65.8%, 636 of 966) was predominant and mean age was 39.8 ± 12.6 years. Fever (79%), dry cough (55%), and loss of test/smell (51%) were frequent and 74% patients had >3 symptoms.

Emotional CPR (eCPR) is a program and practice developed by persons with a lived experience of recovery from trauma or mental health challenges to train community members from diverse backgrounds to support others through mental health crises. eCPR trainers have found that eCPR may promote feelings of belonging by increasing supportive behaviors toward individuals with mental health problems. Thus, clinical outcomes related to positive and negative affect would improve along with feelings of loneliness. OBJECTIVE: This study examined the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of eCPR. METHODS: We employed a pre-post design with 151 individuals, including peer support specialists, service users, clinicians, family members, and nonprofit leaders, who participated in virtual eCPR trainings between April 20, 2020, and July 31, 2020. Instruments were administered before and after training and included the Herth Hope Scale; Empowerment Scale; Flourishing Scale (perceived capacity to support individuals); Mindful Attention Awareness Scale; Active-Empathic Listening Scale (supportive behaviors toward individuals with mental health challenges); Social Connectedness Scale (feelings of belonging and connection with others); Positive and Negative Affect Schedule; and University of California, Los Angeles 3-item Loneliness Scale (symptoms and emotions). The eCPR fidelity scale was used to determine the feasibility of delivering eCPR with fidelity. We conducted 2-tailed paired t tests to examine posttraining improvements related to each scale. Additionally, data were stratified to identify pre-post differences by role. RESULTS: Findings indicate that it is feasible for people with a lived experience of a mental health condition to develop a program and train people to deliver eCPR with fidelity. Statistically significant pre-post changes were found related to one's ability to identify emotions, support others in distress, communicate nonverbally, share emotions, and take care of oneself, as well as to one's feelings of social connectedness, self-perceived flourishing, and positive affect (P&#8804;.05). Findings indicated promising evidence of pre-post improvements (not statistically significant) related to loneliness, empowerment, active-empathetic listening, mindfulness awareness, and hope. Nonprofit leaders and workers demonstrated the greatest improvements related to loneliness, social connectedness, empathic listening, and flourishing. Peer support specialists demonstrated the greatest improvements related to positive affect, and clinicians demonstrated the greatest improvements related to mindfulness awareness. CONCLUSIONS: Promising evidence indicates that eCPR, a peer-developed and peer-delivered program, may increase feelings of belonging while increasing supportive behaviors toward individuals with mental health problems and improving clinical outcomes related to positive and negative affect and feelings of loneliness.","Myers, Amanda L; Collins-Pisano, Caroline; Ferron, Joelle C; Fortuna, Karen L",J Particip Med,,141

We propose to elucidate the implications of SARS-CoV2 copies in concurrent nasopharyngeal swab (NPS), whole mouth fluid (WMF) and respiratory droplet (RD) samples on disease pathogenesis/transmission. METHODS: SARS-CoV2 copies quantified by RT-PCR in concurrent NPS, WMF and RD samples from 80 suspected COVID-19 patients were analysed with demographics, immune response and disease severity. RESULTS: Among the 55/80 (69%) NPS-positive patients, SARS-CoV2 was detected in 44/55 (80%) WMF (concordance with NPS-84%; p = 0.02) and 17/55(31%) RD samples. SARS-CoV2 copies were similar in NPS (median:8.74 × 10^5) and WMF (median:3.07 × 10^4), but lower in RD (median:3.60 × 10^2). The 25-75% interquartile range of SARS-CoV2 copies in the NPS was significantly higher in patients who shed the virus in WMF (p = 0.0001) and RD (p = 0.01). Multivariate analyses showed that hospitalized patients shed significantly higher virus copies in the WMF (p = 0.01). Hospitalized patients with more severe disease (p = 0.03) and higher IL-6 values (p = 0.001) shed more SARS-CoV2 virus in the RD. CONCLUSIONS: WMF may be used reliably as a surrogate for diagnosis. High copy numbers in the NPS probably imply early disease onset, while in the WMF and RD may imply more severe disease and increased inflammation.","Kannian, Priya; Jayaraman, Bagavad Gita; Alamelu, Swarna; Lavanya, Chandra; Kumarasamy, Nagalingeswaran; Rajan, Gunaseelan; Ranganathan, Kannan; Mahanathi, Pasuvaraj; Ashwini, Veeraraghavan; Challacombe, Stephen J; Webster-Cyriaque, Jennifer; Johnson, Newell W",Virus Res,,141

The principles that assure this vital targeting are known from the D. melanogaster model: DCC-intrinsic specificity of DNA binding, cooperativity with the CLAMP protein, and noncoding roX2 RNA transcribed from the X chromosome. We found that in D. virilis, a species separated from melanogaster by 40 million years of evolution, all principles are active but contribute differently to X specificity. In melanogaster, the DCC subunit MSL2 evolved intrinsic DNA-binding selectivity for rare PionX sites, which mark the X chromosome. In virilis, PionX motifs are abundant and not X-enriched. Accordingly, MSL2 lacks specific recognition. Here, roX2 RNA plays a more instructive role, counteracting a nonproductive interaction of CLAMP and modulating DCC binding selectivity. Remarkably, roX2 triggers a stable chromatin binding mode characteristic of DCC. Evidently, X-specific regulation is achieved by divergent evolution of protein, DNA, and RNA components.","Villa, Raffaella; Jagtap, Pravin Kumar Ankush; Thomae, Andreas W; Campos Sparr, Aline; Forné, Ignasi; Hennig, Janosch; Straub, Tobias; Becker, Peter B",Genes dev,,141

MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this review we identified 136 published studies in PubMed's curated literature database LitCovid on SARS-CoV­2 detection methods in tissues and evaluated them regarding sources of error, specificity, and sensitivity of the methods, taking into account our own experience. RESULTS: Currently, no sufficiently specific histomorphological alterations or diagnostic features for COVID-19 are known. Therefore, three approaches for SARS-CoV­2 detection are used: RNA, proteins/antigens, or morphological detection by electron microscopy. In the preanalytical phase, the dominant source of error is tissue quality, especially the different intervals between sample collection and processing or fixation (and its duration) and specifically the interval between death and sample collection in autopsies. However, this information is found in less than half of the studies (e.g., in only 42% of autopsy studies). Our own experience and first studies prove the significantly higher sensitivity and specificity of RNA-based detection methods compared to antigen or protein detection by immunohistochemistry or immunofluorescence. Detection by electron microscopy is time consuming and difficult to interpret. CONCLUSIONS: Different methods are available for the detection of SARS-CoV­2 in tissue. Currently, RNA detection by RT-PCR is the method of choice. However, extensive validation studies and method harmonization are not available and are absolutely necessary.","von Stillfried, Saskia; Boor, Peter",Pathologe,,141

511696,A systematic literature review of the capabilities and performance metrics of supply chain resilience,2020,"Endotheliopathy is suggested to be an important feature of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients. To determine whether endotheliopathy is involved in COVID-19-associated mortality, markers of endothelial damage were assessed in critically ill COVID-19 patients upon intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Thirty-eight critically ill COVID-19 patients were included in this observational study, 10 of whom died in the ICU. Endothelial biomarkers, including soluble (s)E-selectin, sP-selectin, angiopoietin 1 and 2 (Ang-1 and Ang-2, respectively), soluble intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (sICAM-1), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), soluble vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin, and von Willebrand factor (vWf), were measured upon ICU admission. The ICU cohort was subsequently divided into survivors and non-survivors; Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to explore associations between biomarkers and survival, while receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated to determine their potential prognostic value. sE-selectin, sP-selectin, Ang-2, and sICAM-1 were significantly elevated in ICU non-survivors compared to survivors, and also associated with a higher mortality probability in the Kaplan-Meier analysis. The prognostic values of sE-selectin, Ang-2, and sICAM-1 from the generated ROC curves were greater than 0.85. Hence, we conclude that in our cohort, ICU non-survivors had higher levels of specific endothelial markers compared to survivors. Elevated levels of these markers upon ICU admission could possibly predict mortality in COVID-19.","Vassiliou, Alice G; Keskinidou, Chrysi; Jahaj, Edison; Gallos, Parisis; Dimopoulou, Ioanna; Kotanidou, Anastasia; Orfanos, Stylianos E",,,141

Methods: Throat swabs, sputum and blood samples, and anal swabs were collected from 104 patients with COVID-19 at admission to test for 2019-nCoV nucleic acid. Clinical characteristics and hematological indexes were compared between viral nucleic acid-positive and -negative groups of different sample types. Fifteen patients whose anal swabs were positive for viral nucleic acid were selected to analyze the length of time before the nucleic acid turned negative in different specimens. Results: Compared with the patients having negative anal swab test results, those having positive test results showed decreased lymphocytes, increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (HsCRP), and higher incidence of severe COVID-19. The levels of HsCRP and IL-6 and the incidence of severe COVID-19 were significantly higher in patients with positive throat swab test results than in those with negative results. No significant difference in hematological indexes or the proportion of severe cases was detected between the patients with positive and negative sputum test results. Only 1.92% of the patients had positive blood test results, but all of them were severe patients. The positive rate of sputum test was the highest, which was 46.15%. Patients with positive results of both throat and anal swab test had significantly decreased lymphocytes, increased HsCRP and IL-6 levels, and higher incidence of critical COVID-19. It took longer time for patients to have negative anal swab and sputum test results. Moreover, it should be noticed that the viral nucleic acid in sputum might become positive again after it turned negative. Conclusions: Patients with positive anal swab test results had reduced lymphocytes, enhanced inflammatory response and higher incidence of severe COVID-19, suggesting that a positive anal swab test might be an indicator of severe COVID-19. Moreover, the time of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid turning negative in anal swabs was longer than that in throat swabs. The combined detection of throat swabs and anal swabs would help to predict the occurrence of severe COVID-19.","Gan, Xing; Hua, Lin; Liu, Qing; Xie, Dan; Wu, Zhiqiang; Xiong, Yan; Zhou, Bing; Xue, Guohui",Chin.

Seeking for the input data homogeneity, we analyze single-stranded RNA viruses only. Two approaches are used to obtain the nucleotide sequences; In the first one, chunks of equal length (four nucleotides) are considered. In the second approach, the whole RNA genome is divided into parts by adenine or the most frequent nucleotide as a""space"". Rank--frequency distributions are studied in both cases. Within the first approach, the P\'olya and the negative hypergeometric distribution yield the best fit. For the distributions obtained within the second approach, we have calculated a set of parameters, including entropy, mean sequence length, and its dispersion. The calculated parameters became the basis for the classification of viruses. We observed that proximity of viruses on planes spanned on various pairs of parameters corresponds to related species. In certain cases, such a proximity is observed for unrelated species as well calling thus for the expansion of the set of parameters used in the classification. We also observed that the fourth most frequent nucleotide sequences obtained within the second approach are of different nature in case of human coronaviruses (different nucleotides for MERS, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 versus identical nucleotides for four other coronaviruses). We expect that our findings will be useful as a supplementary tool in the classification of diseases caused by RNA viruses with respect to severity and contagiousness.","Husev, Mykola; Rovenchak, Andrij",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.09702v1.pdf,141

The risk of getting an infection with COVID-19 might impact the emotional well-being in patients with cancer. The aim of this study was to investigate quality of life (QoL) for patients with cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional survey, including questions about demographics, concerns of COVID-19 impact on cancer treatment and outpatient clinic visits, and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30 questionnaire was sent to patients with cancer at the Department of Oncology, Odense University Hospital, Denmark. The survey was open from 15th May to 29th May 2020, and 4.571 responded. Results were compared to the Danish 'Barometer Study' conducted by the Danish Cancer Society to elucidate experiences with the Danish healthcare system prior to COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: In total, 9% of patients with cancer had refrained from consulting a doctor or the hospital due to fear of COVID-19 infection, and 80% were concerned about contracting COVID-19 to some extent. Seventeen patients were tested positive for COVID-19. The mean global QoL and emotional functioning (EF) scores were 71.3 and 82.8, respectively. In comparison to the 'Barometer Study', no clinical significant differences in QoL and EF scores were observed. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that being 'Concerned about contracting corona-virus' was correlated with lower QoL and EF scores. Factors associated with being concerned of contracting COVID-19 were comorbid conditions, incurable cancer, receiving medical cancer treatment and female gender. CONCLUSION: Danish patients with cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic did not have lower scores of QoL and emotional functioning compared to the Danish 'Barometer Study'. However, the study suggests that concerns of contracting COVID-19 was correlated with lower scores of QoL.","Jeppesen, Stefan S; Bentsen, Kristian K; Jørgensen, Trine L; Holm, Hanne S; Holst-Christensen, Linda; Tarpgaard, Line S; Dahlrot, Rikke H; Eckhoff, Lise",Acta Oncol,,141

593183,Numerical simulation and stability analysis of a novel reaction–diffusion COVID-19 model,2021-06-28,"Successful host defence against a pathogen can involve resistance or tolerance, with implications for prioritising either antimicrobial or immunomodulatory therapeutic approaches. Hyper-inflammation occurs in Covid-19 and is associated with worse outcomes. The efficacy of dexamethasone in preventing mortality in critical Covid-19 suggests that inflammation has a causal role in death. Whether this deleterious inflammation is primarily a direct response to the presence of SARS-CoV-2 requiring enhanced resistance, or an independent immunopathologic process necessitating enhanced tolerance, is unknown. Here we report an aberrant immune response in fatal Covid-19, principally involving the lung and reticuloendothelial system, that is not clearly topologically associated with the virus, indicating tissue-specific tolerance of SARS-CoV-2. We found that inflammation and organ dysfunction in fatal Covid-19 did not map to the widespread tissue and cellular distribution of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and protein, both between and within tissues. A monocyte/myeloid-rich vasculitis was identified in the lung, along with an influx of macrophages/monocytes into the parenchyma. In addition, stereotyped abnormal reticulo-endothelial responses (reactive plasmacytosis and iron-laden macrophages) were present and dissociated from the presence of virus in lymphoid tissues. Our results support virus-independent immunopathology being one of the primary mechanisms underlying fatal Covid-19. This supports prioritising pathogen tolerance as a therapeutic strategy in Covid-19, by better understanding non-injurious organ-specific viral tolerance mechanisms and targeting aberrant macrophage and plasma cell responses.","Dorward, D.

597634,Socioeconomic Vulnerabilities and Housing Reconstruction in Puerto Rico After Hurricanes Irma and Maria,2021-09-26,"BACKGROUND: In patients with type 2 diabetes, hyperglycaemia is an independent risk factor for COVID-19-related mortality. Associations between pre-infection prescription for glucose-lowering drugs and COVID-19-related mortality in people with type 2 diabetes have been postulated but only investigated in small studies and limited to a few agents. We investigated whether there are associations between prescription of different classes of glucose-lowering drugs and risk of COVID-19-related mortality in people with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: This was a nationwide observational cohort study done with data from the National Diabetes Audit for people with type 2 diabetes and registered with a general practice in England since 2003. Cox regression was used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) of COVID-19-related mortality in people prescribed each class of glucose-lowering drug, with covariate adjustment with a propensity score to address confounding by demographic, socioeconomic, and clinical factors. FINDINGS: Among the 2 851 465 people with type 2 diabetes included in our analyses, 13 479 (0·5%) COVID-19-related deaths occurred during the study period (Feb 16 to Aug 31, 2020), corresponding to a rate of 8·9 per 1000 person-years (95% CI 8·7–9·0). The adjusted HR associated with recorded versus no recorded prescription was 0·77 (95% CI 0·73–0·81) for metformin and 1·42 (1·35–1·49) for insulin. Adjusted HRs for prescription of other individual classes of glucose-lowering treatment were as follows: 0·75 (0·48–1·17) for meglitinides, 0·82 (0·74–0·91) for SGLT2 inhibitors, 0·94 (0·82–1·07) for thiazolidinediones, 0·94 (0·89–0·99) for sulfonylureas, 0·94 (0·83–1·07) for GLP-1 receptor agonists, 1·07 (1·01–1·13) for DPP-4 inhibitors, and 1·26 (0·76–2·09) for α-glucosidase inhibitors. INTERPRETATION: Our results provide evidence of associations between prescription of some glucose-lowering drugs and COVID-19-related mortality, although the differences in risk are small and these findings are likely to be due to confounding by indication, in view of the use of different drug classes at different stages of type 2 diabetes disease progression. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is no clear indication to change prescribing of glucose-lowering drugs in people with type 2 diabetes.

To develop a small nonhuman primate model for filovirus disease, common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) were intramuscularly inoculated with wild type Marburgvirus Musoke or Ebolavirus Zaire. The infection resulted in a systemic fatal disease with clinical and morphological features closely resembling human infection. Animals experienced weight loss, fever, high virus titers in tissue, thrombocytopenia, neutrophilia, high liver transaminases and phosphatases and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Evidence of a severe disseminated viral infection characterized principally by multifocal to coalescing hepatic necrosis was seen in EBOV animals. MARV-infected animals displayed only moderate fibrin deposition in the spleen. Lymphoid necrosis and lymphocytic depletion observed in spleen. These findings provide support for the use of the common marmoset as a small nonhuman primate model for filovirus induced hemorrhagic fever.","Carrion, Ricardo; Ro, Youngtae; Hoosien, Kareema; Ticer, Anysha; Brasky, Kathy; de la Garza, Melissa; Mansfield, Keith; Patterson, Jean L.",Virology,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682211003965; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682211003965; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21959017/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2011.08.022,141

We sought to identify host and immune determinants of prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection. METHODS: Ninety-five symptomatic outpatients self-collected mid-turbinate nasal, oropharyngeal (OP), and gingival crevicular fluid (oral fluid) samples at home and in a research clinic a median of 6 times over 1-3 months. Samples were tested for viral RNA, virus culture, and SARS-CoV-2 and other human coronavirus antibodies, and associations were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: Viral RNA clearance, as measured by SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR, in 507 URT samples occurred a median (IQR) 33.5 (17-63.5) days post-symptom onset. Sixteen nasal-OP samples collected 2-11 days post-symptom onset were virus culture positive out of 183 RT-PCR positive samples tested. All participants but one with positive virus culture were negative for concomitant oral fluid anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The mean time to first antibody detection in oral fluid was 8-13 days post-symptom onset. A longer time to first detection of oral fluid anti-SARS-CoV-2 S antibodies (aHR 0.96, 95% CI 0.92-0.99, p=0.020) and BMI ≥ 25kg/m(2) (aHR 0.37, 95% CI 0.18-0.78, p=0.009) were independently associated with a longer time to SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA clearance. Fever as one of first three COVID-19 symptoms correlated with shorter time to viral RNA clearance (aHR 2.06, 95% CI 1.02-4.18, p=0.044). CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that delayed rise of oral fluid SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies, elevated BMI, and absence of early fever are independently associated with delayed URT viral RNA clearance.","Antar, Annukka A R; Yu, Tong; Pisanic, Nora; Azamfirei, Razvan; Tornheim, Jeffrey A; Brown, Diane M; Kruczynski, Kate; Hardick, Justin P; Sewell, Thelio; Jang, Minyoung; Church, Taylor; Walch, Samantha N; Reuland, Carolyn; Bachu, Vismaya S; Littlefield, Kirsten; Park, Han-Sol; Ursin, Rebecca L; Ganesan, Abhinaya; Kusemiju, Oyinkansola; Barnaba, Brittany; Charles, Curtisha; Prizzi, Michelle; Johnstone, Jaylynn R; Payton, Christine; Dai, Weiwei; Fuchs, Joelle; Massaccesi, Guido; Armstrong, Derek T; Townsend, Jennifer L; Keller, Sara C; Demko, Zoe O; Hu, Chen; Wang, Mei-Cheng; Sauer, Lauren M; Mostafa, Heba H; Keruly, Jeanne C; Mehta, Shruti H; Klein, Sabra L; Cox, Andrea L; Pekosz, Andrew; Heaney, Christopher D; Thomas, David L; Blair, Paul W; Manabe, Yukari C",Open Forum Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofab195; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34095338/,141

PRRSV is the causative agent of both severe and persistent respiratory disease and reproductive failure in pigs worldwide. The PRRSV virion contains a core made of the 123 amino acid nucleocapsid (N) protein, a product of the ORF7 gene. We have determined the crystal structure of the capsid-forming domain of N. The structure was solved to 2.6 Å resolution by SAD methods using the anomalous signal from sulfur. The N protein exists in the crystal as a tight dimer forming a four-stranded β sheet floor superposed by two long α helices and flanked by two N- and two C-terminal α helices. The structure of N represents a new class of viral capsid-forming domains, distinctly different from those of other known enveloped viruses, but reminiscent of the coat protein of bacteriophage MS2.","Doan, Danny N.P; Dokland, Terje",Structure,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0969212603002193; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969212603002193; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14604534/,141

ARDS patients display elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines and innate immune cells, and T and B cell lymphocytes have been implicated in this dysregulated immune response. Mast cells are abundant resident cells of the respiratory tract and are able to release different inflammatory mediators rapidly following stimulation. Recently, mast cells have been associated with tissue damage during viral infections, but their role in SARS‐CoV‐2 infection remains unclear. In this study, we examined the profile of mast cell activation markers in the serum of COVID‐19 patients. We noticed that SARS‐CoV‐2‐infected patients showed increased carboxypeptidase A3 (CPA3) and decreased serotonin levels in their serum when compared with symptomatic SARS‐CoV‐2‐negative patients. CPA3 levels correlated with C‐reactive protein, the number of circulating neutrophils, and quick SOFA. CPA3 in serum was a good biomarker for identifying severe COVID‐19 patients, whereas serotonin was a good predictor of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. In summary, our results show that serum CPA3 and serotonin levels are relevant biomarkers during SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. This suggests that mast cells and basophils are relevant players in the inflammatory response in COVID‐19 and may represent targets for therapeutic intervention.","Soria‐Castro, Rodolfo; Meneses‐Preza, Yatsiri G.; Rodríguez‐López, Gloria M.; Romero‐Ramírez, Sandra; Sosa‐Hernández, Víctor A.; Cervantes‐Díaz, Rodrigo; Pérez‐Fragoso, Alfredo; Torres‐Ruíz, José J.; Gómez‐Martín, Diana; Campillo‐Navarro, Marcia; Álvarez‐Jiménez, Violeta D.; Pérez‐Tapia, Sonia M.; Chávez‐Blanco, Alma D.; Estrada‐Parra, Sergio; Maravillas‐Montero, José L.; Chacón‐Salinas, Rommel",J Leukoc Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34057753/; https://doi.org/10.1002/jlb.4hi0221-087r,141

The functional impact of such polymorphisms has been suggested from data derived from genetic association studies, in vitro experiments with primary cells, and transgenic overexpression models. However, heterogeneous genetic background and non-physiological transgene expression levels confound interpretation, leading to conflicting mechanistic conclusions. To overcome these limitations, we used CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology in human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) to create a unique suite of four isogenic homozygous variants at amino acid positions 16(G/R) and 27(G/Q), which reside in the N terminus of the β(2)AR. By producing cardiomyocytes from these hPSC lines, we determined that at a functional level β(2)AR signaling dominated over β(1)AR . Examining changes in beat rates and responses to isoprenaline, Gi coupling, cyclic AMP (cAMP) production, downregulation, and desensitization indicated that responses were often heightened for the GE variant, implying differential dominance of both polymorphic location and amino acid substitution. This finding was corroborated, since GE showed hypersensitivity to doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity relative to GQ and RQ variants.

METHOD: Chest CT images of 301 with NTM-LD and 804 with MTB-LD confirmed by pathogenic microbiological examination were retrospectively collected. The differences between the clinical manifestations of the two diseases were analysed. 3D-ResNet was developed to randomly extract data in an 8:1:1 ratio for training, validating, and testing. We also collected external test data (40 with NTM-LD and 40 with MTB-LD) for external validation of the model. The activated region of interest was evaluated using a class activation map. The model was compared with three radiologists in the test set. RESULT: Patients with NTM-LD were older than those with MTB-LD, patients with MTB-LD had more cough, and those with NTM-LD had more dyspnoea, and the results were statistically significant (p < 0.05). The AUCs of our model on training, validating, and testing datasets were 0.90, 0.88, and 0.86, respectively, while the AUC on the external test set was 0.78. Additionally, the performance of the model was higher than that of the radiologist, and without manual labelling, the model automatically identified lung areas with abnormalities on CT > 1000 times more effectively than the radiologists. CONCLUSION: This study shows the efficacy of 3D-ResNet as a rapid auxiliary diagnostic tool for NTB-LD and MTB-LD.

614954,The “new normal” in education,2020-11-24,"Diagnosis of tuberculosis in pediatric patients remains challenging due to inherent difficulties associated with obtaining respiratory samples for molecular and culture-based testing. To address this, recent studies have highlighted the utility of tongue swabs to detect Mycobacterium tuberculosis genomic DNA in the oral epithelia of tuberculosis infected adults. It is unknown whether tongue swabs have similar utility for diagnosis of childhood tuberculosis and if the presence of DNA in these swabs was associated with whole bacilli. We therefore sought to conduct a preliminary assessment of the utility of tongue swabs to detect tubercle bacilli and their associated genetic material in young children. For this, we recruited hospitalized children with clinically diagnosed tuberculosis (n = 26) or lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI, n = 9). These categories were blinded for downstream laboratory tests, which included PCR, spoligotyping, smear microscopy, and culture. Mtb genomic DNA was detected by PCR only in clinically diagnosed TB cases [11/26 (31.4%)] and not in cases with LRTI. Of these, 5/11 [45.5%] were associated with a spoligotype. Spoligotyping also detected an additional six specimens that were negative by PCR. Using smear microscopy, 19/26 [73.1%] and 4/9 [44.4] were Mtb positive in the tuberculosis or LRTI categories respectively. We noted positive results on all three tests in 5/26 [19.2%] in the tuberculosis category and 0/9 in the LRTI category. All specimens were culture negative. Collectively, these preliminary data present a compelling case for broader testing of tongue swabs to diagnose tuberculosis in children where obtaining standard sputum specimens is not easy.","Ealand, Christopher; Peters, Julian; Jacobs, Olivia; Sewcharran, Astika; Ghoor, Azra; Golub, Jonathan; Brahmbhatt, Heena; Martinson, Neil; Dangor, Ziyaad; Lala, Sanjay G.; Kana, Bavesh",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34195103/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fcimb.2021.696379,141

In the USA alone, nosocomial infections cause about 1.7 million infections and 99 000 deaths per year. HAIs are spread by numerous routes including surfaces (especially hands), air, water, intravenous routes, oral routes and through surgery. Interventions such as proper hand and surface cleaning, better nutrition, sufficient numbers of nurses, better ventilator management, use of coated urinary and central venous catheters and use of high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters have all been associated with significantly lower nosocomial infection rates. Multiple infection control techniques and strategies simultaneously (‘bundling’) may offer the best opportunity to reduce the morbidity and mortality toll of HAIs. Most of these infection control strategies will more than pay for themselves by saving the medical costs associated with nosocomial infections. Many non-pharmacological interventions to prevent many HAIs will also reduce the need for long or multiple-drug antibiotic courses for patients. Lower antibiotic drug usage will reduce risk of antibiotic-resistant organisms and should improve efficacy of antibiotics given to patients who do acquire infections.","Curtis, L.

622423,The Millennium Project: the positive health implications of improved environmental sustainability,2005-02-19,"COVID-19 has caused worldwide death and economic destruction. The pandemic is the result of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which has demonstrated high rates of infectivity leading to great morbidity and mortality in vulnerable populations. At present, scientists are exploring various approaches to curb this pandemic and alleviate its health consequences, while racing to develop a vaccine. A particularly insidious aspect of COVID-19 is the delayed overactivation of the body's immune system that is manifested as the cytokine storm. This unbridled production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines can directly or indirectly cause massive organ damage and failure. Systemic vascular endothelial inflammation and thrombocytopenia are potential consequences as well. In the case of COVID-19, the cytokine storm often fits the pattern of the macrophage activation syndrome with lymphocytopenia. The basis for the imbalance between the innate and adaptive immune systems is not clearly defined, but highlights the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on macrophages. Here we discuss the potential underlying basis for the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on macrophages, both direct and indirect, and potential therapeutic targets. These include granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin 6 (IL-6), interferons, and CXCL10 (IP-10). Various biopharmaceuticals are being repurposed to target the cytokine storm in COVID-19 patients. In addition, we discuss the rationale for activating the macrophage alpha 7 nicotinic receptors as a therapeutic target. A better understanding of the molecular consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection of macrophages could lead to novel and more effective treatments for COVID-19.","Booz, George W.; Altara, Raffaele; Eid, Ali H.; Wehbe, Zena; Fares, Souha; Zaraket, Hassan; Habeichi, Nada J.; Zouein, Fouad A.",Eur J Pharmacol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejphar.2020.173547; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014299920306397?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32919938/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0014299920306397,141

RNA segment 2 (2224 nucleotides) of Dhori virus contains a single long open reading frame that can encode a 716-amino amid polypeptide (81.3 kDa). The predicted polypeptide shares between 27 and 31% sequence identities with the PB1 polypeptides of influenza A, B, and C viruses. Among the regions most highly conserved are the sequences around the Asp-Asp motif common to many RNA polymerases. In spite of the high level of sequence identity between the Dhori RNA segment 2 gene product and the influenza A, B, and C virus PB1 proteins the amino acid composition of the Dhori protein indicates an acidic charge feature at pH 7.0 in contrast to the basic nature of the PB1 proteins of the influenza viruses. We suggest that the Dhori PB1-like protein be designated the Pα protein of this virus.","Lin, Debby A.; Roychoudhury, Sonali; Palese, Peter; Clay, William C.; Fuller, Frederick J.",Virology,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/004268229190641N; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/004268229190641N; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2024457/,141

METHODS An NLS (non-linear least square) method estimated the parameters of a differentiated logistic growth function of new COVID-19 cases in multiple regions in China and nations with a large amount of cases based on training data from Feb. 20 to Mar. 13. A restriction test was subsequently employed to test whether a designated parameter was identical among regions or countries. We conducted diagnosis of the residuals and also its goodness of fit with testing data from Mar. 13 to Apr. 18. FINDINGS We find that the model fits time series data exceedingly well in China, its provinces, and two other nations, and we provide estimates of key parameters. We reject the null hypothesis that the growth rate of the outbreak is the same among ten selected provinces as well as between South Korea and Iran. We also find that the model does not provide reliable estimates in countries that are in the early stages of outbreak. We further find that the R2 value be varied and misleading when compared among different curves of the same nonlinear model, as well as the existence of heteroskedasticity and positive serial correlation within residuals in some provinces and nations. CONCLUSION We believe that there is potential for our model to contribute to better public health policy combatting COVID-19 by providing a simple logistical framework for retrospectively analyzing the outbreak in regions that have already experienced maximal proliferation in cases. However, based upon our statistical findings, we outline certain pitfalls in modelling and their implications on results.","Shen, Christopher Y",International journal of infectious diseases : IJID : official publication of the International Society for Infectious Diseases,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971220303039; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.04.085; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32376306/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971220303039?v=s5,141
624066,Rapid tool based on a food environment typology framework for evaluating effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on food system resilience,2020-07-16,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to evaluate pediatric patients using existing macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) scoring systems to determine how these systems identify patients with cytokine storm syndrome (CSS) in the setting of a multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) and active coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. METHODS: Hospitalized pediatric patients with MIS-C and active COVID-19 infection at a single institution were identified. Infectious data, clinical findings, and laboratory values were collected, and patients were stratified by disease severity. Eight historically used scoring systems for MAS, HLH, and CSS were examined in the cohort of patients with MIS-C and pediatric COVID-19. RESULTS: The HLH-2004 criteria and HScore did not identify any patients as having CSS on admission, with only one patient with COVID-19 meeting criteria at peak disease severity. The 2016 systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA)/MAS criteria, ferritin/erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) ratio, and COVID-19 CSS Quick Score most frequently identified CSS in this population and distinguished between COVID-19 and MIS-C hyperinflammation. The 2019 MAS/sJIA (MS) score and the COVID-19-associated hyperinflammatory syndrome (cHIS) criteria were less likely to identify CSS, as the MS score overestimated CSS and the cHIS resulted in similar scores regardless of severity or disease type. The Caricchio COVID-Cytokine Storm (COVID-CS) criteria identified patients with COVID-19 frequently but was less useful in MIS-C because of its COVID-19-specific criteria. CONCLUSION: MIS-C and pediatric COVID-19 result in relatively unique CSSs and patterns of inflammation. Existing scoring systems for CSSs likely do not capture the full breadth of this disease process in MIS-C and pediatric COVID-19.","Reiff, Daniel D; Cron, Randy Q",ACR open rheumatology,https://doi.org/10.1002/acr2.11331; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34431626/,141

Binding was also observed with a sample of Neu5,7Ac(2)-GD3, however at a lower degree. Sialic acids with two or threeO-acetyl groups in the side chain of synthetic sialic acid derivatives are not recognized by the virus. In these experiments, bound viruses were detected with esterase substrates. Influenza C-virus was also used for the histological identification of mono-O-acetylated sialic acids in combination with an immunological visualization of the virus bound to thin-sections. The occurrence of these sialic acids was demonstrated in bovine submandibular gland, rat liver, human normal adult and fetal colon and diseased colon, as well as in human sweat gland. Submandibular gland and colon also contain significant amounts of glycoconjugates with two or three acetyl esters in the sialic acid side chain, demonstrating the value of the virus in discriminating between mono- and higherO-acetylation at the same site. The patterns of staining showed differences between healthy persons and patients with colon carcinoma, ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease. Remarkably, some human colon samples did not showO-acetyl sialic acid-specific staining.

625045,Real estate listings and their usefulness for hedonic regressions,2021-01-13,"BACKGROUND: The vulnerability of cardiovascular disease (CVD) patients’ health abilities, combined with the severity of the disease and the overlapping risk factors, leads such people to bear the economic burden of the disease due to the medical services. We estimated the economic burden of CVD and identified the weak link in the design of the medical insurance. METHODS: Data from 5610 middle-aged and elderly with CVD were drawn from the 2015 wave of “China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study” (CHARLS). The recommended method of the “World Health Organization” (WHO) was adopted to calculate “catastrophic health expenditure” (CHE), “impoverishment by medical expenses” (IME), and applied the treatment-effect model to analyze the determinants of CHE. RESULTS: The incidence of CHE was 19.9% for the elderly families with CVD members, which was 3.6% higher than for uninsured families (16.3%). Families with CVD combined with > 3 other chronic diseases (38.88%) were the riskiest factor for the high CHE in the new rural cooperative medical system (NCMS). Moreover, families with members > 75 years old (33.33%), having two chronic disease (30.74%), and families having disabled members (33.33%), hospitalization members (32.41%) were identified as the high risky determinants for the high CHE in NCMS. CONCLUSIONS: Elderly with physical vulnerabilities were more prone to CHE. The medical insurance only reduced barriers to accessing health resources for elderly with CVD; however it lacked the policy inclination for high-utilization populations, and had poorly accurate identification of the vulnerable characteristics of CVD, which in turn affects the economic protection ability of the medical insurance. The dispersion between the multiple medical security schemes leads to the existence of blind spots in the economic risk protection of individuals and families.","Ma, Meiyan; Tian, Wanxin; Kang, Jian; Li, Yuze; Xia, Qi; Wang, Nianshi; Miao, Wenqing; Zhang, Xiyu; Zhang, Yiyun; Shi, Baoguo; Gao, Han; Sun, Tao; Fu, Xuelian; Hao, Yanhua; Li, Heng; Shan, Linghan; Wu, Qunhong; Li, Ye",Global Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33781274/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12992-021-00683-7,141

We aimed to describe the clinical learning experience of undergraduate medical students undertaking internal medicine clerkship during the COVID-19 pandemic at Makerere University, Uganda. METHODS: A descriptive, cross-sectional study among medical students in clinical years of study pursuing the Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery undergraduate degree program was conducted in November 2020. Only 3rd (junior clerks) and 5th (senior clerks) year medical students whose internal medicine clerkships were interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic were studied. RESULTS: Data of 188 (95%) eligible clinical year students; junior (101, 54.0%) and senior (86, 46.0%) were analysed. Median age was 24 (range: 22–42) years. Majority (70.1%) were male and Ugandan nationals (94.1%). Sixty-four (30.3%) students reported inadequate personal protective equipment, 152 (81.7%) felt at risk of contracting COVID-19, and 127 (67.9%) said it was difficult to observe COVID-19 standard operating procedures. Twenty-two students (11.9%) were discouraged from pursuing a career in internal medicine. Overall, most students reported good or excellent clinical experience pre-COVID-19 era compared to during the COVID-19 era (4.0 vs 3.5, p<0.0001). Senior clerks significantly believed that the time allocated for the rotation was adequate (p<0.0001) and they were able to complete their study objectives (p<0.001), compared to the junior clerks. Senior clerks believed that learning was difficult when combined with junior clerks (p=0.013). About half of the students (51.4%, n=95) reported clinical teaching should remain as it was in the pre-COVID-19 era.

627672,Utilitarian Principlism as a Framework for Crisis Healthcare Ethics,2021-01-15,"Atherosclerosis (AS) leading to myocardial infarction and stroke remains worldwide the main cause for mortality. Vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques are responsible for these life-threatening clinical endpoints. Atherosclerosis is a chronic, complex, inflammatory disease with interactions between metabolic dysfunction, dyslipidemia, disturbed microbiome, infectious triggers, vascular, and immune cells. Undoubtedly, the immune response is a most important piece of the pathological puzzle in AS. Although macrophages and T cells have been the focus of research in recent years, B cells producing antibodies and regulating T and natural killer (NKT) cell activation are more important than formerly thought. New results show that the B cells exert a prominent role with atherogenic and protective facets mediated by distinct B cell subsets and different immunoglobulin effects. These new insights come, amongst others, from observations of the effects of innovative B cell targeted therapies in autoimmune diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). These diseases associate with AS, and the beneficial side effects of B cell subset depleting (modifying) therapies on atherosclerotic concomitant disease, have been observed. Moreover, the CANTOS study (NCT01327846) showed impressive results of immune-mediated inflammation as a new promising target of action for the fight against atherosclerotic endpoints. This review will reflect the putative role of B cells in AS in an attempt to connect observations from animal models with the small spectrum of the thus far available human data.

METHODS: Breast, prostate, and head and neck cancer patients of all stages and treatment modalities (N = 200) participated in this observational study. Patients completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Checklist Individual Strength, Distress Thermometer and problem list. Patients with increased risk on AD based on these questionnaires were scheduled for a diagnostic interview. Patients diagnosed with AD were invited to participate in a randomized controlled trial on the cost-effectiveness of psychological treatment. Participation in this trial was used as a proxy of acceptance of psychological treatment. Logistic regression analyses were used to investigate associated factors. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of AD was estimated at 13.1%. Sensitivity analyses showed prevalence rates of AD of 11.5%, 15.0%, and 23.5%. Acceptance of psychological treatment was estimated at 65%. AD was associated both with being employed (OR = 3.3, CI = 1.3–8.4) and having a shorter time since diagnosis (OR = 0.3, CI = 0.1–0.8).

Accordingly, this cross-sectional study was performed to evaluate the echocardiography indices which are indicators of the cardiac alterations of the children with COVID19 infection. Methods: This study was performed as a cross-sectional study evaluating echocardiography indices in children infected with COVID19. Fifteen children, known cases of the COVID19, and 14 healthy children were enrolled. Evaluated parameters include left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF), left ventricle end-diastolic diameter (LVED), mitral valve Sa (MV Sa), Tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE), and laboratory parameters. Results: The participants' mean age and weight were 62.8 (±48.0) months and 19.95 (±15.67) kg, respectively. None of the laboratory and echocardiography parameters differed between males and females, between patients with and without positive past medical history, between the patients with and without respiratory tract symptoms, and between patients with and without GI tract symptoms (P.0.05). Patients had significantly higher TAPSE (p = 0.027), although MV Sa (p = 0.01) was significantly higher among healthy children. LV EF (p = 0.425) and LVED diameter (p = 0.603) were not different significantly. None of the patients had pericardial effusion, pleural effusion, and cardiac tamponade. Conclusion: The heart can be involved during the disease course in children, even at the level of echocardiography indices. This could contribute to a worse prognosis, higher morbidity, and mortality rate, especially in patients with overt myocardial involvement.

All the mask samples, including 12 surgical and four N95/P1/P2 masks, were identified to be made of polypropylene, with polyethylene terephthalate present in the N95/P1/P2 masks. Di-methyl phthalate, di-n-butyl phthalate, di-ethyl phthalate, di-isobutyl phthalate and di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate were frequently detected and their concentration summed up 55 ± 35 ~ 1700 ± 140 ng per surgical mask and 2300 ± 150 ~ 5200 ± 800 ng per N95/P1/P2 mask. Our simulation experiment suggested a mean loss of 13 - 71% of phthalate mass depending on compounds, during 5-hour wearing of these masks. This resulted in an estimated daily intake of individual compounds no higher than 20 ng/kg/day for adults and 120 ng/kg/day for toddlers, which were at least 80 times lower compared to relevant tolerable daily intake values. Two interventional trials were conducted where a volunteer wore a mask for four hours and urine samples were collected before and after the mask wearing. No obvious increase was observed for the urinary concentration of any phthalate metabolite, indicating minimal contribution to overall exposure to phthalate esters.","Wang, Xianyu; Okoffo, Elvis D; Banks, Andrew Pw; Li, Yan; Thomas, Kevin V; Rauert, Cassandra; Aylward, Lesa L; Mueller, Jochen F",Journal of hazardous materials,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34479081/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.127001,141

AIM: To determine the characteristics, outcomes and predictors of outcomes for hospitalised patients with coronavirus disease (COVID‐19) within the RAH. METHODS: We performed a retrospective audit of 103 patients diagnosed with COVID‐19 who were discharged from the RAH between 14 February and 21 May 2020. We collected demographic, clinical and laboratory data through an audit of electronic medical records. The main outcome measures were: (i) the need for oxygen supplementation; (ii) need for intensive care unit (ICU) care; and (iii) death in hospital. RESULTS: The median age of patients was 60 years (range 19–85). A total of 55 (53%) patients was male. All patients were independent at baseline; 37 (36%) patients suffered from hypertension. Cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease and diabetes were present in fewer than 19 (18%) patients. Obesity was present in 24 (23%) patients; 39 (38%) patients required supplemental oxygen, 18 (17%) required ICU care and 4 (4%) patients died. Older patients were significantly more at risk of oxygen requirement (median 68 vs 57.5 years, P < 0.01), ICU admission (median 66.5 vs 60 years, P = 0.04) and death (median 74.5 vs 60 years, P = 0.02). We did not find a statistically significant association between gender, body mass index and poor outcomes. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was the only parameter at admission associated with oxygen requirement, ICU care and death. Peak LDH, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, C‐reactive protein and neutrophil lymphocyte ratio were significantly associated with oxygen requirement, ICU admission and death (P < 0.05 for all of the above laboratory markers). CONCLUSIONS: Although our sample size was small, we found that certain comorbidities and laboratory values were associated with poor outcomes. This occurred in a setting where care was not influenced by limited hospital and intensive care beds.","Toh, Dylan J.‐W.; Rowe, Emily; Nelson, Renjy; O'Connell, Alice; Lim, Ken; Fielke, Lauren; He, Jiacheng; Faunt, Jeffrey",Intern Med J,https://doi.org/10.1111/imj.15106; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33631864/,141

This systematic review aims to examine the conceptualisation of male involvement in maternal health globally and review commonly used indicators. METHODS: PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science and CINAHL databases were searched for quantitative literature (between the years 2000 and 2020) containing indicators representing male involvement in maternal health, which was defined as the involvement, participation, engagement or support of men in all activities related to maternal health. RESULTS: After full-text review, 282 studies were included in the review. Most studies were conducted in Africa (43%), followed by North America (23%), Asia (15%) and Europe (12%). Descriptive and text mining analysis showed male involvement has been conceptualised by focusing on two main aspects: psychosocial support and instrumental support for maternal health care utilisation. Differences in measurement and topics were noted according to continent with Africa focusing on HIV prevention, North America and Europe on psychosocial health and stress, and Asia on nutrition. One-third of studies used one single indicator and no common pattern of indicators could be identified. Antenatal care attendance was the most used indicator (40%), followed by financial support (17%), presence during childbirth (17%) and HIV testing (14%). Majority of studies did not collect data from men directly. DISCUSSION: Researchers often focus on a single aspect of male involvement, resulting in a narrow set of indicators. Aspects such as communication, shared decision making and the subjective feeling of support have received little attention. We believe a broader holistic scope can broaden the potential of male involvement programmes and stimulate a gender-transformative approach. Further research is recommended to develop a robust and comprehensive set of indicators for assessing male involvement in maternal health.","Galle, Anna; Plaieser, Gaëlle; Van Steenstraeten, Tessa; Griffin, Sally; Osman, Nafissa Bique; Roelens, Kristien; Degomme, Olivier",BMJ Glob Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33846143/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjgh-2020-004909,141

In this study, we sought to validate the recent positive findings from the randomised clinical trial RECOVERY and to evaluate the challenges in the analysis and interpretation of non-randomized comparative effectiveness studies in Covid-19. METHODS We performed a retrospective cohort study using an openly available database of hospitalised Covid-19 patients in Spain. The primary outcome was all-cause in-hospital mortality at 28 days. We used multivariable Fine and Gray competing risk models which adjusted for both fixed and time-variant confounders to investigate the effect of TCZ on the primary outcome. RESULTS We analysed 2547 patients hospitalised with Covid-19 between 1st January and 28th June 2020. Patients in the TCZ group tended to have more severe Covid-19 at admission, as measured by biomarkers of disease severity including CRP, D-dimer and LDH. At 28 days, 91 out of 440 TCZ patients had died compared to 267 out of 2107 patients in the control group. In multivariable analysis, there was no evidence of an association between TCZ and the primary outcome (adjusted hazard ratio 1.20, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.64, P=0.26). CONCLUSIONS Our observational study failed to find a benefit of TCZ on all-cause in-hospital mortality in Covid-19 patients compared with randomized trials, highlighting the impact that unmeasured confounding and other sources of bias can have in a retrospective observational setting. For future observational studies, we recommend prospective data collection to ensure all variables have the necessary quality, completeness and timing for reliable treatment evaluation.","Owen, R. R.

635596,"Worlds Apart: Technology, Remote Work, and Equity",2021,"This study aimed to explore the psychological situation and the influence of the outbreak of COVID-19 on college students. An online questionnaire survey was conducted among 3,092 Chinese college students who were quarantined at home as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey tools included the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item Scale (GAD-7), the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), and the Self-Rating Scale of Sleep (SRSS). Of all the respondents, the prevalence of anxiety symptoms, sleep problems, any of the two, and both of the two, were 16.8, 13.5, 25.1, and 5.3%, respectively. Of the participants, 43.7% of the college students had higher perceived stress. Factors associated with anxiety symptoms included reading the daily news with higher frequency (1–3 times; 4–7 times; more than 7 times), having sleep problems, higher stress, and carelessness with the number of remaining masks. Factors associated with sleep problems included postgraduates, reading the news with higher frequency daily (1–3 times), the frequency of going out per week (1–3 times), having anxiety symptoms and higher stress. Factors associated with higher perceived stress included reading the daily news with higher frequency (4–7 times), anxiety about the number of remaining masks (1–10; more than 20), having anxiety symptoms, and having sleep problems. The prevalence of anxiety symptoms, sleep problems, and higher perceived stress among college students was high during the COVID-19 outbreak. Particular attention should be paid to psychological support for college students quarantined at home, especially those at high risk of psychological problems.","Wang, Xing; Chen, Hongguang; Liu, Ling; Liu, Yuan; Zhang, Nan; Sun, Zhenghai; Lou, Qing; Ge, Weichun; Hu, Bo; Li, Mengqian",Front Psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33329134/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.588693,141

High-risk sexual behaviors are widely viewed as the key contributors to the levels of STDs, especially in adolescents and young adults. This article situates the sexual risk behaviors of Black, Indigenous, and other young people of color within the framework of racism. It begins with an overview of racial inequities in common STDs and shows how racism gives rise to several risk factors for high-risk sexual behaviors. These risk factors for STDs identified in prior research are best understood as adaptations to the challenges and constraints faced by youth in socially disadvantaged environments. Both social adversity and the mental health problems that it triggers can lead to risky sexual behaviors. Drawing on findings from prior research with youth of color, this paper describes the needed interventions that can markedly reduce STDs and their risk factors. It also describes needed research on interventions that could contribute to the knowledge and understanding of the adverse conditions fueled by racism that affect youth of color, their health, and their communities.","Boutrin, Marie-Claire; Williams, David R.",Healthcare (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34199974/; https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare9060673,141
640138,The rise in climate change-induced federal fishery disasters in the United States,2021-04-22,"BACKGROUND: The SARS-CoV-2 virus is the cause of the latest pandemic of the 21st century; it is responsible for the development of COVID-19. Within the multiple study models for both the biology and the treatment of SARS-CoV-2, the use of stem cells has been proposed because of their ability to increase the immune response and to repair tissue. Therefore, the objective of this review is to evaluate the role of stem cells against SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 in order to identify their potential as a study model and as a possible therapeutic source against tissue damage caused by this virus. Therefore, the following research question was established: What is the role of stem cells in the study of SARS-CoV-2 and the treatment of COVID-19? MATERIALS AND METHODS: A search was carried out in the electronic databases of PUBMED, Scopus, and ScienceDirect. The following keywords were used: “SARS-CoV-2,” “COVID-19,” and “STEM CELL,” plus independent search strategies with the Boolean operators “OR” and “AND.” The identified reports were those whose main objective was the study of stem cells in relation to SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19. For the development of this study, the following inclusion criteria were taken into account: studies whose main objective was the study of stem cells in relation to SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19 and clinical case studies, case reports, clinical trials, pilot studies, in vitro, or in vivo studies. For assessment of the risk of bias for in vitro studies, the SciRAP tool was used. The data collected for each type of study, clinical or in vitro, were analyzed with descriptive statistics using the SPSS V.22 program. RESULTS: Of the total of studies included (n = 39), 22 corresponded to in vitro investigations and 17 to human studies (clinical cases (n = 9), case series (n = 2), pilot clinical trials (n = 5), clinical trials (n = 1)). In vitro studies that induced pluripotent stem cells were the most used (n = 12), and in clinical studies, the umbilical stem cells derived were the most reported (n = 11). The mean age of the study subjects was 58.3 years. After the application of stem cell therapy, the follow-up period was 8 days minimum and 90 days maximum. Discussion. The mechanism by which the virus enters the cell is through protein “S,” located on the surface of the membrane, by recognizing the ACE2 receptor located on the target cell. The evidence that the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in stem cells indicates that stem cells from bone marrow and amniotic fluid have very little expression. This shows that stem cell has a low risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSION: The use of stem cells is a highly relevant therapeutic option. It has been shown in both in vitro studies and clinical trials that it counteracts the excessive secretion of cytokines. There are even more studies that focus on long-term follow-up; thus, the potential for major side effects can be analyzed more clearly. Finally, the ethical use of stem cells from fetal or infant origin needs to be regulated. The study was registered in PROSPERO (no. CRD42021229038). The limitations of the study were because of the methodology employed, the sample was not very large, and the follow-up period of the clinical studies was relatively short.","Cuevas-Gonzalez, María Verónica; Garcia-Perez, Álvaro; Gonzalez-Aragon Pineda, Álvaro Edgar; Espinosa-Cristobal, León Francisco; Donohue-Cornejo, Alejandro; Tovar-Carrillo, Karla Lizette; Saucedo-Acuña, Rosa Alicia; Cuevas-Gonzalez, Juan Carlos",Biomed Res Int,https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/9915927; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34458372/,141

Here we report the development of a multidimensional, patient-completed disease assessment tool for use in psoriatic arthritis (PsA). METHODS: A focus group development and education method was used, followed by a paired observation design to assess feasibility and validity. The Psoriatic Arthritis Disease Activity Score (PASDAS) was used as the basis for the clinical assessments, but elements of this tool were modified during the focus group sessions. RESULTS: A preliminary tool assessed tender and swollen joint counts, enthesitis, dactylitis, area of skin involved by psoriasis, and scores for global disease activity, fatigue, and spinal pain. In parallel assessments, good agreement was found between subject and healthcare professional (HCP) assessors, although overall disease activity was low. CONCLUSION: A self-assessment tool for disease activity in PsA has been developed in conjunction with patients, demonstrating generally good agreement between patients and HCPs; however, further validation is needed before it can be recommended for clinical practice.","Mahmood, Farrouq; English, Beverley; Waxman, Robin; Helliwell, Philip S",J. rheumatol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33934080/; https://doi.org/10.3899/jrheum.210010,141

METHODS: A cross‐sectional descriptive study was conducted through an online survey of patients with cancer who were sheltering at home from 29th March to 3rd May 2020. Perception of self‐isolation was assessed using the ISOLA scale, after evaluation of its psychometric properties. Content analysis was used to analyse two open‐ended questions. RESULTS: The participants were 195 adult patients with cancer (female = 76%; mean age = 50.3 ± 11.2; haematological malignancy = 51.3%). They reported moderate isolation‐related suffering (M = 2.64 ± 0.81), problems in their relationships with others (M = 3.31 ± 1.13) and difficulties in their relationships with themselves (M = 3.14 ± 1.06). Patients who experienced significantly more social problems were older, had less education and were living without minor children. Overall, four main categories emerged from the qualitative content analysis: (1) lack of freedom and social life, (2) uncertainty and worries, (3) feeling supported and (4) dealing with isolation.

Compared to crude emulsions prepared by conventional homogenization, a size reduction of over two orders of magnitude was observed for AsX-encapsulated oil droplets following just one pass through the annular valve. In krill oil formulations, the mean hydrodynamic diameter of lipid particles was reduced to 60 nm after only two passes through the valve and reached a minimal size of 24 nm after eight passes. Repeated processing of samples through the valve progressively decreased lipid particle size, with an inflection in the rate of particle size reduction generally observed after 2–4 passes. Krill- and argan oil-based nanoemulsions were produced using an Ultra Shear Technology™ (UST™) approach and characterized in terms of their small particle size, low polydispersity, and stability.","Smejkal, Gary B.; Ting, Edmund Y.; Nambi Arul Nambi, Karthik; Schumacher, Richard T.; Lazarev, Alexander V.",Molecules,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34065944/; https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules26102856,141

Methods: During the lockdown, we submitted an online questionnaire to patients already diagnosed with primary headache disorders. Questions explored the course of headache, daily habits, psychological factors related to COVID- 19, general mood and school stress. Answers were transformed into data for statistical analysis. Through a bivariate analysis, the main variables affecting the subjective trend of headache, and intensity and frequency of the attacks were selected. The significant variables were then used for the multivariate analysis. Results: We collected the answers of 707 patients. In the multivariate analysis, we found that reduction of school effort and anxiety was the main factor explaining the improvement in the subjective trend of headache and the intensity and frequency of the attacks (p&lt;0.001). The greater the severity of headache, the larger was the clinical improvement (p&lt;0.001). Disease duration was negatively associated with the improvement (p&lt;0.001). It is noteworthy that clinical improvement was independent of prophylaxis (p&gt;0.05), presence of chronic headache disorders (p&gt;0.05) and geo- graphical area (p&gt;0.05).

There is also a long-standing and concurrent rise in the prevalence and severity of substance use disorders (SUD). Therefore, the intersection between these two conditions needs to be carefully considered to ensure a more effective delivery of healthcare. RECENT FINDINGS: Generally, those with SUDs are more likely to have higher risk social determinants of health factors. Therefore, these patients are more likely to have barriers that can create difficulties in following appropriate infection control measures which in turn increases the risk of exposure to SARS-CoV2. In addition, these individuals have higher rates of medical comorbidities which increases the risk of all adverse outcomes, including mortality, from SARS-CoV2 infection. SUMMARY: Individuals with SUDs are at increased risk of both contracting SARS-CoV2 infection and suffering from worse outcomes afterwards. Though these risks of adverse outcomes are specific of SARS-CoV2 infection, the risk of exposure to other infectious diseases is increased in this population too. Healthcare providers and policymakers should then consider how to better protect this at-risk population and alleviate this increased disease burden.","Balaram, Kripa; Marwaha, Raman; Kaelber, David C.",Curr Opin Psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34001701/; https://doi.org/10.1097/yco.0000000000000711,141
651022,Video-based observation in impact evaluation,2021,"Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a host ectopeptidase and the receptor for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, albeit virus-ACE2 interaction goes far beyond viral entry into target cells. Controversial data exists linking viral infection to changes in ACE2 expression and function, which might influence the subsequent induction of an inflammatory response. Here, we tested the significance of soluble ACE2 enzymatic activity longitudinally in nasopharyngeal swabs and plasma samples of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, along with the induction of inflammatory cytokines. Release of soluble functional ACE2 increases upon SARS-CoV-2 infection in swabs and plasma of infected patients, albeit rapidly decreasing during infection course in parallel with ACE2 gene expression. Similarly, SARS-CoV-2 infection also induced the expression of inflammatory cytokines. These changes positively correlated with the viral load. Overall, our results demonstrate the existence of mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 modulates ACE2 expression and function, intracellular viral sensing and subsequent inflammatory response, offering new insights into ACE2 dynamics in the human upper respiratory tract and pointing towards soluble ACE2 levels as a putative early biomarker of infection severity.","Gutiérrez-Chamorro, Lucía; Riveira-Muñoz, Eva; Barrios, Clara; Palau, Vanesa; Nevot, Maria; Pedreño-López, Sònia; Senserrich, Jordi; Massanella, Marta; Clotet, Bonaventura; Cabrera, Cecilia; Mitjà, Oriol; Crespo, Marta; Pascual, Julio; Riera, Marta; Ballana, Ester",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34578296/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v13091715,141

Twelve Holstein bull calves (approximately 3 wk of age) were allocated by initial body weight to Control (n = 5) and treated (n = 7) groups. On d 0, all calves were orally challenged with 1 × 107 plaque forming units of virulent coronavirus isolate. Infection was allowed to progress for 24h before treatment was started. On d 1, treated calves began receiving 160g of dry bovine serum powder (16g IgG) mixed into milk replacer powder (67g) at both an a.m. and p.m. feeding. Control calves received only milk replacer powder (227g) at both feedings. Response to coronavirus challenge and dietary treatment was monitored prior to a.m. and p.m. feeding by the collection of multiple clinical measures. Fecal consistency was decreased by coronavirus challenge but was not affected by dietary treatment. Mean daily rectal temperature and heart rate were not affected by dietary treatment. Average packed cell volume was higher in treated calves than in control (35.0 and 27.0%). Coronavirus challenge resulted in an immediate increase in respiration rate, decreasing by d 7. Control calves tended to have a greater average respiration rate compared with treated (28.7 vs. 26.8 breaths/min). Treated calves had a higher average feed intake than control (0.57 vs. 0.44 kg/d). These data suggest that bovine-serum supplemented milk replacer may decrease the severity of disease in young calves exposed to coronavirus.","Arthington, J. D.; Jaynes, C. A.; Tyler, H.

With neither sufficient vaccination capacity nor effective medication, non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) remain the measure of choice. However, NPIs place a great burden on society, the mental health of individuals, and economics. Therefore the cost/benefit ratio must be carefully balanced and a target-oriented small-scale implementation of these NPIs could help achieve this balance. To this end, we introduce a modified SEIR-class compartment model and parametrize it locally for all 412 districts of Germany. The NPIs are modeled at district level by time varying contact rates. This high spatial resolution makes it possible to apply geostatistical methods to analyse the spatial patterns of the pandemic in Germany and to compare the results of different spatial resolutions. We find that the modified SEIR model can successfully be fitted to the COVID-19 cases in German districts, states, and also nationwide. We propose the correlation length as a further measure, besides the weekly incidence rates, to describe the current situation of the epidemic.","Schampuumller, L.; Calabrese, J.

Previously, the human DEAD-box helicase DDX1 was suggested to be involved in Rev functions, but this relationship is not well understood. Biochemical studies of DDX1 and its interactions with Rev and model RNA oligonucleotides were carried out to investigate the molecular basis for association of these components. A combination of gel-filtration chromatography and circular dichroism spectroscopy demonstrated that recombinant DDX1 expressed in E. coli is a well-behaved folded protein. Binding assays using fluorescently-labeled Rev and cell-based immunoprecipitation analysis confirmed a specific RNA-independent DDX1-Rev interaction. Additionally, DDX1 was shown to be an RNA-activated ATPase, wherein Rev-bound RNA was equally effective at stimulating ATPase activity as protein-free RNA. Gel mobility shift assays further demonstrated that DDX1 forms complexes with Rev-bound RNA. RNA silencing of DDX1 provided strong evidence that DDX1 is required for both Rev activity and HIV production from infected cells. Collectively, these studies demonstrate a clear link between DDX1 and HIV-1 Rev in cell based assays of HIV-1 production, and provide the first demonstration that recombinant DDX1 binds Rev and RNA, and has RNA dependent catalytic activity.","Edgcomb, Stephen P.; Carmel, Andrew B.; Naji, Souad; Ambrus-Aikelin, Geza; Reyes, Jason R.; Saphire, Andrew C.S.; Gerace, Larry; Williamson, James R.",Journal of Molecular Biology,http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3249508?pdf=render; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22051512/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283611011697; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022283611011697; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2011.10.032,141

This research focuses on analyzing whether the factors significant in cyberbullying susceptibility changed with the lockdown. The study was conducted by surveying 256 students before the pandemic, in October 2019, and 118 students during the lockdown, in June 2020. This included questions about the respondents’ demographics, online presence, experience with offline bullying, perception of other’s opinions, and the instances of cyberbullying that apply to them. The results showed factors important in both timespans, namely (i) experience with offline bullying; (ii) individuals’ perceptiveness to others’ opinions; (iii) frequency of social media posts. Additionally, in the period before lockdown, factors namely (i) tendency to interact with strangers online; (ii) whether they’ve started a relationship online (iii) hours spent on social media; were found significant. Conversely, during the lockdown, additional distinct factors namely (i) being opinionated on public platforms; (ii) preference of Instagram; (iii) preferred gaming platform; (iv) number of games played; (v) sexual orientation; (vi) age were significant.

However, the poor thermostability of NF-based derivatives has been an unconquerable barrier for more than 150 years, thus hindering its application. In this study, the first example of a nitrogen-rich hydrogen-bonded organic framework (HOF-NF) is designed and constructed through self-assembly in energetic materials, in which NF anions are trapped in pores of the resulting framework via the dual force of ionic and hydrogen bonds from the strengthened framework. These factors lead to the decomposition temperature of the resulting HOF-NF moiety being 200 °C, which exceeds the challenge of thermal stability over 180 °C for the first time among NF-based compounds. A large number of NF-based compounds with high stabilities and excellent properties can be designed and synthesized on the basis of this work.","Zhang, Jichuan; Feng, Yongan; Staples, Richard J.; Zhang, Jiaheng; Shreeve, Jean’ne M.",Nat Commun,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-22475-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33837215/,141

We investigated the presence of and risk factors associated with poor mental health, sleep disorders among RDs during the pandemic. METHODS: This cross-sectional Italian citizen science project evaluated the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in patients with RDs. Between May and September 2020, eleven RD patients’ associations sent the survey by using their mailing list and the related webpage and social network. 507 RD patients completed an ad-hoc anonymous online survey including the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and Impact Event Scale-Revised (IES-R). RESULTS: The mean scores on the PSS-10 and the IES-R were 18.1 and 29.7, respectively. Higher PSS scores were associated with younger age (p < 0.01), female gender (p < 0.01), overweight/obesity (p = 0.01), psychiatric pharmacotherapy (p < 0.01), and anxiety for loss of income (p < 0.01). Higher IES-R scores were associated with female gender (p < 0.01), intestinal diseases (p = 0.03), anxiety (p < 0.01), and health concern (p < 0.01). Among 375 patients with inflammatory arthritis, 246 (65.6%) had trouble staying asleep, 238 (63.5%) falling asleep, and 112 (29.9%) had dreams about the pandemic. Older age (OR = 1.038, CI 1.002–1.076), psychiatric pharmacotherapy (OR = 25.819, CI 11.465–58.143), and COVID infection (OR = 2.783, CI 1.215–6.372) were predictive of insomnia during the pandemic.

As many commercial antibody tests are either time-consuming or tend to produce false negative or false positive results when only one antigen is considered, we developed an automated, flow-based chemiluminescence microarray immunoassay (CL-MIA) that allows for the detection of IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD), spike protein (S1 fragment), and nucleocapsid protein (N) in human serum and plasma in less than 8 min. The CoVRapid CL-MIA was tested with a set of 65 SARS-CoV-2 serology positive or negative samples, resulting in 100% diagnostic specificity and 100% diagnostic sensitivity, thus even outcompeting commercial tests run on the same sample set. Additionally, the prospect of future quantitative assessments (i.e., quantifying the level of antibodies) was demonstrated.

Guidance issued by CDC on active monitoring was a cornerstone of its response to the West Africa Ebola outbreak. There are limited data on how to balance the costs and performance of this important public health activity. We present a framework that estimates the risks and costs of specific durations of active monitoring for pathogens of significant public health concern. We analyze data from New York City’s Ebola active monitoring program over a 16-month period in 2014-2016. For monitored individuals, we identified unique durations of active monitoring that minimize expected costs for those at “low (but not zero) risk” and “some or high risk”: 21 and 31 days, respectively. Extending our analysis to smallpox and MERS-CoV, we found that the optimal length of active monitoring relative to the median incubation period was reduced compared to Ebola due to less variable incubation periods. Active monitoring can save lives but is expensive. Resources can be most effectively allocated by using exposure-risk categories to modify the duration or intensity of active monitoring.","Reich, Nicholas G; Lessler, Justin; Varma, Jay K; Vora, Neil M",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/156497,141

Data are scarce on the role of rhinovirus (RV) infections in this patient group. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the role of RV infections in preschool asthma: (i) susceptibility factors, (ii) clinical course, and (iii) medium‐term outcome. METHODS: A total of 130 asthmatic children aged 4‐6 years from the multinational PreDicta cohort were prospectively followed for a 12‐month period. Allergy tests and a standard health questionnaire were carried out at study entry. Respiratory virus presence in nasopharyngeal washes was studied at illness visits and at 3 scheduled visits. RESULTS: At study entry, mean age of the children was 5.3 years. Of 571 visits, 54% were positive for any virus and 39% for RV. Patient characteristics were only assessed with RV infection due to low number of other viruses. The use of supplementary vitamin D was inversely associated with RV infection (P < .05). RV infection was associated with more severe course of acute illness in terms of more severe nighttime coughing, more sleep disturbances, and more days with runny nose (all P < .05). RV infection was also associated with more severe disease course during the 12‐month follow‐up in terms of more nights with awakenings and more days of exercise‐related symptoms (both P < .05).

How can we re-design the concept of Well-being and Public Health in relation to the living places of the future? METHODS: According to the previous statements and scenario, this paper aims to integrate the building hygiene and well-being, focusing the possible responses, both existing and for the new buildings, taking home a strong message from this “period” of physical distancing. RESULTS: The Well-being and Public Health recommendations for a healthy, safe, and sustainable housing are framed into the following key points: 1. Visible and accessible green elements and spaces; 2. Flexibility, adaptability, sharing, and crowding of living spaces, and compliant functions located into the buildings; 3. Re-appropriation of the basic principles and archetypes of sustainable architecture, thermal comfort and Indoor Air Quality (IAQ); 4. Water consumption and Wastewater Management; 5. Urban Solid Waste Management; 6. Housing automation and electromagnetic fields; 7. Indoor building and finishing materials.

OBJECTIVE: This analysis evaluated adherence and satisfaction with EPL treatment as patient-reported outcomes and their relationship with changes in laboratory and ultrasound parameters among Russian patients with NAFLD. METHODS: Data were pooled from three observational Russian studies—MANPOWER (2015–2016), LIDER 1 (2012–2013), and LIDER 2 (2013)—in which EPLs were used for at least 12 weeks in the treatment of liver diseases and which measured both subjective and objective endpoints. Only patients who had NAFLD were included in this analysis. The main endpoints were to determine treatment adherence and satisfaction with 12 weeks of EPL therapy, relationship between adherence/satisfaction and changes in the laboratory and ultrasound parameters. A secondary subgroup analysis was performed to identify patients with NAFLD who responded better (or worse) to 24 weeks of adjunctive EPL treatment. RESULTS: Overall, 3384 patients were included. A total of 82.2% of patients were adherent to 12 weeks of EPL treatment; high/very high satisfaction was reported by 15.3%/65.9% of clinicians and 15.9%/64.4% of patients. There was positive correlation between patients’ adherence and satisfaction and significant improvement in laboratory (transaminases, lipid profile; p < 0.001) and ultrasound (steatosis, p < 0.001) parameters, and improvement in symptoms (p < 0.001) after 24 weeks of EPL.

CONCLUSIONS: Patients with NAFLD treated with adjunctive EPL therapy in real-world clinical practice in Russia showed good treatment adherence and treatment satisfaction. Improvements in laboratory and ultrasound parameters, as well as dynamics of patient symptoms, were positively correlated with adherence and satisfaction.

668301,Assessment of the State of Economic Security in Russia Using the Example of the Unemployment Rate Indicator: Fractal Analysis Method,2021-05-06,"Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is caused by SARS-Cov-2 and the manifestations of this infection range from an absence of symptoms all the way up to severe disease leading to death. To estimate the prevalence of past infection in a population, the most readily available method is the detection of antibodies against the virus. This study has investigated the prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in outpatients of the Hospital das Clinicas, in Sao Paulo city (Brazil), which is a large university hospital belonging to the public health system that cares for patients with complex diseases who need tertiary or quaternary medical care. Our serological inquiry was carried out for 6 weeks, with once-a-week blood sampling and included 439 patients from several outpatient services. Overall, 61 patients tested positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG (13.9%); 56.1 % of the patients live in Sao Paulo city, with the remaining living in other towns of the metropolitan area; 32.8% of the patients testing positive for IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 were asymptomatic, 55.7% developed mild or moderate disease and 11.5% had to be hospitalized. The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 positive serology was lower among patients who had received the seasonal influenza vaccine compared to the ones who did not. These findings may indicate that those individuals care more about health issues, and/or that they have a better access to health care and/or a better quality of health care service. The large proportion of patients who were unaware of having had contact with SARS-CoV-2 deserves attention, reflecting the scarcity of tests performed in the population.","Oliveira, Luanda Mara da Silva; Tiyo, Bruna Tiaki; da Silva, Lais Teodoro; Fonseca, Luiz Augusto Marcondes; Rocha, Rosana Coura; dos Santos, Vera Aparecida; Ceneviva, Carina; Bedin, Anderson Aparecido; de Almeida, Alexandre; Duarte, Alberto José da Silva; Oshiro, Telma Miyuki",Revista do Instituto de Medicina Tropical de Sao Paulo,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33206865/; https://doi.org/10.1590/s1678-9946202062091,141

Leading into the International Polar Year 2007–2008, we outline approaches, protocols, and empirical models derived from a decade of integrated research on northern host–parasite systems. Investigations of emerging infectious diseases associated with parasites in northern wildlife involved a network of multidisciplinary collaborators and incorporated geographic surveys, archival collections, historical foundations for diversity, and laboratory and field studies exploring the interface for hosts, parasites, and the environment. In this system, emergence of parasitic disease was linked to geographic expansion, host switching, resurgence due to climate change, and newly recognized parasite species. Such integrative approaches serve as cornerstones for detection, prediction, and potential mitigation of emerging infectious diseases in wildlife and persons in the North and elsewhere under a changing global climate.","Hoberg, Eric P.; Polley, Lydden; Jenkins, Emily J.; Kutz, Susan J.; Veitch, Alasdair M.; Elkin, Brett T.",Emerg Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18258071/; https://doi.org/10.3201/eid1401.071119,141

Analyses of these lesions strongly beneficied from autopsic studies allowing us to improve the knowledge of the pathophysiology mechanisms of this emerging infectious disease. Cytological analyses, notably those obtained from broncho-alveolar lavages, poorly contribute to the Covid-19 diagnosis, but can be usefull for eliminate a couple of differential diagnoses. Although non specific, the lesions observed in the pulmonary parenchyma can be directly associated with the presence of the Sars-CoV-2 thanks to ancillary tools allowing its detection. Indeed, the presence of the virus can be detected using immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, molecular biology and/or electron microscopy approaches. Several uncertainties still exist concerning the direct role due to the Sars-CoV-2 in the observed lesions which can be due too to a cardiovascular failure and/or to the treatment(s) received in intensive care units. Thus, it is critical to keep going to increase our efforts for the tissue analyses, notably thanks to the autopsies of Covid-19 patients, in order to better understand the consequences of this infectious disease, and, particularly according the epidemiological factors and the different associated morbidities.

Little is known about the longitudinal dynamics of SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Blood samples (n=173) were collected from 30 COVID-19 patients over a 3-month period after symptom onset and analyzed for SARS-CoV-2-specific NAbs, using the lentiviral pseudotype assay, coincident with the levels of IgG and proinflammatory cytokines. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2-specific NAb titers were low for the first 7–10 d after symptom onset and increased after 2–3 weeks. The median peak time for NAbs was 33 d (IQR 24–59 d) after symptom onset. NAb titers in 93·3% (28/30) of the patients declined gradually over the 3-month study period, with a median decrease of 34·8% (IQR 19·6–42·4%). NAb titers increased over time in parallel with the rise in IgG antibody levels, correlating well at week 3 (r = 0·41, p & 0·05). The NAb titers also demonstrated a significant positive correlation with levels of plasma proinflammatory cytokines, including SCF, TRAIL, and M-CSF. CONCLUSIONS: These data provide useful information regarding dynamic changes in NAbs in COVID-19 patients during the acute and convalescent phases.","Wang, Kai; Long, Quan-Xin; Deng, Hai-Jun; Hu, Jie; Gao, Qing-Zhu; Zhang, Gui-Ji; He, Chang-Long; Huang, Lu-Yi; Hu, Jie-Li; Chen, Juan; Tang, Ni; Huang, Ai-Long",Clin Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32745196/; https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa1143,141

One of the current questions is how climatological factors and environmental pollution can affect the diffusion of COVID-19 in human society. This study endeavours to explain the relation between wind speed, air pollution and the diffusion of COVID-19 to provide insights to constrain and prevent future pandemics and epidemics. The statistical analysis here focuses on case study of Italy and reveals two main findings: 1) cities with high wind speed have lower numbers of COVID-19 related infected individuals; 2) cities located in hinterland zones (mostly those bordering large urban conurbations) with little wind speed and frequently high levels of air pollution had higher numbers of COVID-19 related infected individuals. Results here suggest that high concentrations of air pollutants, associated with low wind speeds, may promote a longer permanence of the viral particles in the air, thus favouring an indirect means of diffusion of viral infectivity of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), in addition to the direct diffusion with human-to-human transmission dynamics.","Coccia, Mario",Atmos Pollut Res,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1309104220302932; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apr.2020.10.002; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1309104220302932?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33046960/,141

Emerging evidence suggests a pro-inflammatory milieu and hypercoagulable state in patients with this infection. Despite anticoagulation, a large proportion of patients requiring intensive care may develop life-threatening thrombotic complications. Indeed, the levels of some markers of hemostatic activation, such as D-dimer, are commonly elevated in COVID-19, indicating potential risk of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary thromboembolism. In this review, we critically examine and discuss aspects of hypercoagulability and inflammation in COVID-19 and the possible benefits of statins in this scenario, with emphasis on their underlying molecular mechanisms.

METHODS: Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data of 63 COVID-19 pneumonia patients were retrospectively reviewed. Laboratory parameters were also collected within 3–5 days, 7–9 days, and 11–14 days of hospitalization. Outcomes were followed up until March 12, 2020. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients developed critically ill pneumonia; one of them died. Upon admission, older patients with critical illness were more likely to report cough and dyspnoea with higher respiration rates and had a greater possibility of abnormal laboratory parameters than patients without critical illness. When compared with the non-critically ill patients, patients with serious illness had a lower discharge rate and longer hospital stays, with a trend towards higher mortality. The interleukin-6 level in patients upon hospital admission was important in predicting disease severity and was associated with the length of hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: Many differences in clinical features and laboratory findings were observed between patients exhibiting non-critically ill and critically ill COVID-19 pneumonia. Non-critically ill COVID-19 pneumonia also needs aggressive treatments. Interleukin-6 was a superior predictor of disease severity.","Hong, Wandong; Chen, Qin; Qian, Songzan; Basharat, Zarrin; Zimmer, Vincent; Wang, Yumin; Zippi, Maddalena; Pan, Jingye",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fcimb.2021.550456; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34327146/,141

Nous avons cherché à décrire puis à identifier les caractéristiques des malades, les facteurs favorisant cette épidémie puis les moyens de contrôle. Matériels et méthodes Une enquête épidémiologique a été réalisée le 20/04 par une équipe d’infectiologues, de gériatres et d’hygiénistes dans un EHPAD où le 1er cas était diagnostiqué le 02/03. Le dossier des résidents présents du 02/03 au 20/04 a permis de recueillir l’âge, les comorbidités, le statut nutritionnel, le degré de fragilité et la chronologie des symptômes. Tout le personnel a été interviewé par téléphone. Résultats Cinquante-deux (67,5 %) des 76 résidents ont développé des symptômes compatibles avec une infection COVID-19. Le pic épidémique a été atteint 20jours après le premier cas. Les premiers symptômes cliniques les plus fréquents étaient une fièvre (49 %), une toux sèche (29 %), une asthénie (25 %, avec souvent un syndrome de glissement) et une chute (17 %). Il existait un effet significatif service/secteur d’hébergement. La transmission virale s’est faite indépendamment des fragilités propres à chaque résident par non-respect des mesures barrière. Le taux de mortalité sur la période de l’étude a été de 25 %. Les facteurs de risque de mortalité en analyse multivariée en contrôlant pour l’âge et le sexe étaient la démence [HR : 2,7 ; p =0,053], la fièvre (1er signe) [HR : 2,8, p =0,034] et la toux (1er signe) [HR : 2,8, p =0,05].

Dix pour cent (10 résidents et un membre du personnel) des 115 personnes testées de façon systématique entre le 9 et le 14 avril avaient une RT-PCR positive sans avoir eu aucun symptôme. Conclusion Cette épidémie est caractérisée par une atteinte des soignants (54 %) comme des résidents (67,5 %), après une probable introduction du virus par les soignants. La transmission virale a eu lieu entre soignants, entre résidents et entre soignants et résidents. La désorganisation des soins et l’absentéisme (encadrement compris) ainsi que les cas asymptomatiques ont favorisé la dissémination. L’épidémie a été jugulée par le renforcement de l’équipe soignante, un encadrement, un support logistique, la mise en place des mesures barrières, la formation aux pratiques d’hygiène et l’accompagnement par les équipes mobiles de gériatrie et d’hygiène.","Lesens, O.; Lahaye, C.; Gimbergues Cadet, C.; Lair, J.; Bohatier, J.; Petrosyan, E.; Pereira, B.; Calmels, A.; Henquell, C.; Baud, O.",Médecine et Maladies Infectieuses,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0399077X20303401; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0399077X20303401,141

We aimed to survey the experiences of patients with Type 2 diabetes (T2D) during Ramadan 2020. METHODS: Telephone survey of Muslim patients with T2D in Tower Hamlets, London. Patients were surveyed on the effects of COVID-19 on their fast, discussions with a healthcare professional (HCP) before Ramadan, whether they followed advice, number of fasts undertaken, medication changes and adverse events. RESULTS: 829 participated. 334 (40.2%) discussed fasting with a HCP; 198 (59.3%) were advised not to fast; 171 (86.3%) elected not to fast. 12 (1.4%) were admitted to hospital during Ramadan – one fasting related severe hypoglycaemia, one non-fasting cerebrovascular accident, and 10 (four fasting and six non-fasting) with COVID-19 symptoms. 34 (8.2%) patients in the fasting group developed COVID-19 symptoms before or during Ramadan; 30 (7.2%) in the non-fasting cohort. 311 (37.5%) patients said COVID-19 had significantly influenced their decision not to fast. Compared to Ramadan 2016, in Ramadan 2020 fewer people fasted (50.1% vs 55.4%), fewer people discussed fasting with a HCP (40.2% vs 52%), more patients who discussed fasting with their HCP were advised not to fast (59.3% vs 33.8%), and fewer patients fasted against medical advice (13.7% vs. 19.3%).

We conducted a study to address the following question: how has the pandemic impacted US clinicians’ professional roles and relationships? DESIGN: Inductive thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews. SETTING: Clinical settings across the USA in April and May of 2020. PARTICIPANTS: Clinicians with leadership and/or clinical roles during the COVID-19 pandemic. MEASURES: Emergent themes related to professional roles and relationships. RESULTS: Sixty-one clinicians participated in semi-structured interviews. Study participants were practising in 15 states across the USA, and the majority were White physicians from large academic centres. Three overlapping and inter-related themes emerged from qualitative analysis of interview transcripts: (1) disruption: boundaries between work and home life became blurred and professional identity and usual clinical roles were upended; (2) constructive adaptation: some clinicians were able to find new meaning in their work and described a spirit of collaboration, shared goals, open communication and mutual respect among colleagues; and (3) discord and estrangement: other clinicians felt alienated from their clinical roles and experienced demoralising work environments marked by division, value conflicts and mistrust. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians encountered marked disruption of their professional roles, identities and relationships during the pandemic to which they and their colleagues responded in a range of different ways. Some described a spirit of collaboration and camaraderie, while others felt alienated by their new roles and experienced work environments marked by division, value conflicts and mistrust.

Here we analyze viral genome sequences using a phylodynamic model with geographic structure to estimate the origin and spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Europe prior to border closures. Based on SARS-CoV-2 genomes, we reconstruct a partial transmission tree of the early pandemic and coinfer the geographic location of ancestral lineages as well as the number of migration events into and between European regions. We find that the predominant lineage spreading in Europe during this time has a most recent common ancestor in Italy and was probably seeded by a transmission event in either Hubei, China or Germany. We do not find evidence for preferential migration paths from Hubei into different European regions or from each European region to the others. Sustained local transmission is first evident in Italy and then shortly thereafter in the other European regions considered. Before the first border closures in Europe, we estimate that the rate of occurrence of new cases from within-country transmission was within the bounds of the estimated rate of new cases from migration. In summary, our analysis offers a view on the early state of the epidemic in Europe and on migration patterns of the virus before border closures. This information will enable further study of the necessity and timeliness of border closures.","Nadeau, Sarah A.; Vaughan, Timothy G.; Scire, Jérémie; Huisman, Jana S.; Stadler, Tanja",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2012008118; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33571105/,141
