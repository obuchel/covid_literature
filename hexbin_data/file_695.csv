9089,A knowledge base for predicting protein localization sites in eukaryotic cells,2005-07-25,"Mouse hepatitis virus causes a chronic demyelinating disease in C57BL/6 mice. While early studies suggested demyelination is due to direct cytolytic effects of virus on oligodendrocytes, there is increasing evidence for the involvement of the immune system in the mechanism of demyelination. In this study we have asked whether demyelination can occur in the absence of functional MHC class I expression and CD8(+) T cells. We infected transgenic mice lacking expression of β(2) microglobulin (β(2)M(−/−) mice) with MHV-A59. In β(2)M(−/−) mice, virus was much more lethal than in either of the parental strains used to produce the mice; furthermore, while clearance from the CNS did occur in β(2)M(−/−) mice, it was slower than in C57BL/6 mice. This is consistent with the importance of CD8(+) cells in viral clearance. Because of the increased sensitivity of the β(2)M(−/−) mice to infection, only low levels of virus could be used to evaluate chronic disease. Even at these low levels, demyelination did occur in some animals. To compare infection in β(2)M(−/−) and C57BL/6 mice we used a higher dose of an attenuated variant of MHV-A59, C12. The attenuated variant induced less demyelination in C57BL/6 mice compared to wild type A59, but the levels observed were not significantly different from those seen in β(2)M(−/−) mice. Thus, MHV-induced demyelination can occur in some animals in the absence of MHC class I and CD8(+) cells.","Gombold, James L.; Sutherland, Robyn M.; Lavi, Ehud; Paterson, Yvonne; Weiss, Susan R.",Microb Pathog,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134808/,695
18019,Lehre in der Reanimation: Leitlinien des European Resuscitation Council 2021,2021-06-02,"There is an ongoing discussion whether hyperoxia, i.e. ventilation with high inspiratory O(2) concentrations (F(I)O(2)), and the consecutive hyperoxaemia, i.e. supraphysiological arterial O(2) tensions (PaO(2)), have a place during the acute management of circulatory shock. This concept is based on experimental evidence that hyperoxaemia may contribute to the compensation of the imbalance between O(2) supply and requirements. However, despite still being common practice, its use is limited due to possible oxygen toxicity resulting from the increased formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) limits, especially under conditions of ischaemia/reperfusion. Several studies have reported that there is a U-shaped relation between PaO(2) and mortality/morbidity in ICU patients. Interestingly, these mostly retrospective studies found that the lowest mortality coincided with PaO(2) ~ 150 mmHg during the first 24 h of ICU stay, i.e. supraphysiological PaO(2) levels. Most of the recent large-scale retrospective analyses studied general ICU populations, but there are major differences according to the underlying pathology studied as well as whether medical or surgical patients are concerned. Therefore, as far as possible from the data reported, we focus on the need of mechanical ventilation as well as the distinction between the absence or presence of circulatory shock. There seems to be no ideal target PaO(2) except for avoiding prolonged exposure (> 24 h) to either hypoxaemia (PaO(2) < 55–60 mmHg) or supraphysiological (PaO(2) > 100 mmHg). Moreover, the need for mechanical ventilation, absence or presence of circulatory shock and/or the aetiology of tissue dysoxia, i.e. whether it is mainly due to impaired macro- and/or microcirculatory O(2) transport and/or disturbed cellular O(2) utilization, may determine whether any degree of hyperoxaemia causes deleterious side effects.","Demiselle, Julien; Calzia, Enrico; Hartmann, Clair; Messerer, David Alexander Christian; Asfar, Pierre; Radermacher, Peter; Datzmann, Thomas",Ann Intensive Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8170650/,695

25274,Effectiveness of Vaccination Strategies for Infectious Diseases According to Human Contact Networks,2005,"The one airway, one disease hypothesis proposes that the upper and lower airways share the same physiology and histomorphology. Epidemiological clinical studies support a link between rhinosinusitis and asthma. The relationship can occur in both directions, with nasal allergen challenge leading to inflammatory changes in the lower airway and bronchoprovocation studies of the lower airway leading to inflammatory changes in the upper airway. In addition, both similarities and differences exist in the pathogenesis of nasal polyps and asthma. The mechanism for the connection between the upper and lower airways is a matter of great debate. It has been proposed that inflammatory changes in the lower airway may lead to systemic inflammatory effects that play a role in increased bronchial hyperresponsiveness. Similarly, lower airway inflammatory changes may affect nasal airway patency via systemic effects. Moreover, nasopharyngeal-bronchial reflexes may play a non-immunologic role in the interaction between the lower and upper airways. An example of the connection between the upper and lower airways is found in aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease whereby leukotrienes play a role in the pathology of chronic rhinosinusitis with polyps and asthma. It is also been observed that the treatment of asthma is hindered by untreated rhinosinusitis.","Chang, Christopher C.",Diseases of the Sinuses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121820/,695

34700,Modeling of Fire Spread Including Different Heat Transfer Mechanisms Using Cellular Automata,2020-05-26,"This work proposes the use of deep learning architectures, and in particular Convolutional Autencoders (CAE’s), to incorporate an explicit component of orthogonality to the computation of local image descriptors. For this purpose we present a methodology based on the computation of dot products among the hidden outputs of the center-most layer of a convolutional autoencoder. This is, the dot product between the responses of the different kernels of the central layer (sections of a latent representation). We compare this dot product against an indicator of orthogonality, which in the presence of non-orthogonal hidden representations, back-propagates a gradient through the network, adjusting its parameters to produce new representations which will be closer to have orthogonality among them in future iterations. Our results show that the proposed methodology is suitable for the estimation of local image descriptors that are orthogonal to one another, which is often a desirable feature in many patter recognition tasks.","Roman-Rangel, Edgar; Marchand-Maillet, Stephane",Pattern Recognition,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7297571/,695
34749,Deep Learning Assisted Memetic Algorithm for Shortest Route Problems,2020-05-25,"A large number of applications in text data analysis use the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) as one of the most popular methods in topic modeling. Although the instability of the LDA is mentioned sometimes, it is usually not considered systematically. Instead, an LDA is often selected from a small set of LDAs using heuristic means or human codings. Then, conclusions are often drawn based on the to some extent arbitrarily selected model. We present the novel method LDAPrototype, which takes the instability of the LDA into account, and show that by systematically selecting an LDA it improves the reliability of the conclusions drawn from the result and thus provides better reproducibility. The improvement coming from this selection criterion is unveiled by applying the proposed methods to an example corpus consisting of texts published in a German quality newspaper over one month.","Rieger, Jonas; Rahnenführer, Jörg; Jentsch, Carsten",Natural Language Processing and Information Systems,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7298183/,695

34889,Constructing Holistic Patient Flow Simulation Using System Approach,2020-05-23,"Recently, researchers usually use the elastic scaling techniques as a powerful means of the distributed stream processing systems to deal with the high-speed data stream which arrives continuously and fluctuates constantly. The existing methods allocate the same amount of resources to the instances of the same operator, but they ignore the correlation between the operator performance and resource provision. It may lead to the waste of the resources caused by the over-provision or the huge overhead of the scheduling caused by the under-provision. To solve the above problems, we present a quantitative elastic scaling framework, named QEScalor, to allocate resources for the operator instances quantitatively based on the actual performance requirements. The experimental results show that compared with the existing works, the QEScalor can not only achieve resource-efficient elastic scaling with lower cost, but also it can enhance the total performance of the DSPAs.","Mu, Weimin; Jin, Zongze; Zhu, Weilin; Liu, Fan; Li, Zhenzhen; Zhu, Ziyuan; Wang, Weiping",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7302273/,695
34892,Applicability of Machine Learning Methods to Multi-label Medical Text Classification,2020-05-23,"Exascale computing aspires to meet the increasing demands from large scientific applications. Software targeting exascale is typically designed for heterogeneous architectures; henceforth, it is not only important to develop well-designed software, but also make it aware of the hardware architecture and efficiently exploit its power. Currently, several and diverse applications, such as those part of the Exascale Computing Project (ECP) in the United States, rely on efficient computation of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). In this context, we present the design and implementation of heFFTe (Highly Efficient FFT for Exascale) library, which targets the upcoming exascale supercomputers. We provide highly (linearly) scalable GPU kernels that achieve more than [Formula: see text] speedup with respect to local kernels from CPU state-of-the-art libraries, and over [Formula: see text] speedup for the whole FFT computation. A communication model for parallel FFTs is also provided to analyze the bottleneck for large-scale problems.

34907,Towards Network Anomaly Detection Using Graph Embedding,2020-05-23,"Internet-of-Things systems are comprised of highly heterogeneous architectures, where different protocols, application stacks, integration services, and orchestration engines co-exist. As they permeate our everyday lives, more of them become safety-critical, increasing the need for making them testable and fault-tolerant, with minimal human intervention. In this paper, we present a set of self-healing extensions for Node-RED, a popular visual programming solution for IoT systems. These extensions add runtime verification mechanisms and self-healing capabilities via new reusable nodes, some of them leveraging meta-programming techniques. With them, we were able to implement self-modification of flows, empowering the system with self-monitoring and self-testing capabilities, that search for malfunctions, and take subsequent actions towards the maintenance of health and recovery. We tested these mechanisms on a set of scenarios using a live physical setup that we called SmartLab. Our results indicate that this approach can improve a system’s reliability and dependability, both by being able to detect failing conditions, as well as reacting to them by self-modifying flows, or triggering countermeasures.","Dias, João Pedro; Lima, Bruno; Faria, João Pascoal; Restivo, André; Ferreira, Hugo Sereno",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7302539/,695
34944,Analysis of Ensemble Feature Selection for Correlated High-Dimensional RNA-Seq Cancer Data,2020-05-22,"Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity involving book publishers is a continuing feature of the U.S. commercial publishing landscape. Over the last 6 years, from the beginning of 2014 through the end of 2019, there were 120 control transactions involving U.S. trade publishers of all sizes: on average, twenty transactions annually. This activity has proceeded subject to random annual variation uncorrelated to industry performance or to macroeconomic factors; in the last 2 years activity has accelerated, with 27 completed transactions in 2019. Historically, in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, trade publishing M&A activity stalled from the valuations achieved in 2006–2007, even as activity remained relatively steady. We anticipate that in the wake of the pandemic M&A activity will gradually increase as publishers seek stronger partners and increased scale. In the first 5 months of 2020, eight transactions were announced or completed, and ViacomCBS set the stage for a major transaction by announcing its intention to divest Simon & Schuster.","Lamb, David",Pub Res Q,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7302727/,695
34957,Data-Driven Approach to Inversion Analysis of Three-Dimensional Inner Soil Structure via Wave Propagation Analysis,2020-05-22,"Interactive visual exploration of large and multidimensional data still needs more efficient [Formula: see text] data embedding (DE) algorithms. We claim that the visualization of very high-dimensional data is equivalent to the problem of 2D embedding of undirected kNN-graphs. We demonstrate that high quality embeddings can be produced with minimal time&memory complexity. A very efficient GPU version of IVHD (interactive visualization of high-dimensional data) algorithm is presented, and we compare it to the state-of-the-art GPU-implemented DE methods: BH-SNE-CUDA and AtSNE-CUDA. We show that memory and time requirements for IVHD-CUDA are radically lower than those for the baseline codes. For example, IVHD-CUDA is almost 30 times faster in embedding (without the procedure of kNN graph generation, which is the same for all the methods) of the largest ([Formula: see text]) YAHOO dataset than AtSNE-CUDA. We conclude that in the expense of minor deterioration of embedding quality, compared to the baseline algorithms, IVHD well preserves the main structural properties of ND data in 2D for radically lower computational budget. Thus, our method can be a good candidate for a truly big data ([Formula: see text]) interactive visualization.","Minch, Bartosz; Nowak, Mateusz; Wcisło, Rafał; Dzwinel, Witold",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7302810/,695

Despite the obvious advantages of such mechanisms, there are also numerous concerns regarding the quality assurance of work results produced by a large group of anonymous workers. In this work, we use data gathered from a real CS platform in order to study the performance of various approaches to worker selection, including a novel approach that utilizes automatic real-time monitoring of the produced results. We compare the performance of these mechanisms with respect to both overall cost and the accuracy of the final results to benchmark algorithms that aggregate results from a group of workers without pre-selection, relying solely on the “wisdom of crowd”.

35059,A Heterogeneous Multi-scale Model for Blood Flow,2020-05-25,"Multi-class imbalanced classification tasks are characterized by the skewed distribution of examples among the classes and, usually, strong overlapping between class regions in the feature space. Furthermore, frequently the goal of the final system is to obtain very high precision for each of the concepts. All of these factors contribute to the complexity of the task and increase the difficulty of building a quality data model by learning algorithms. One of the ways of addressing these challenges are so-called binarization strategies, which allow for decomposition of the multi-class problem into several binary tasks with lower complexity. Because of the different decomposition schemes used by each of those methods, some of them are considered to be better suited for handling imbalanced data than the others. In this study, we focus on the well-known binary approaches, namely One-Vs-All, One-Vs-One, and Error-Correcting Output Codes, and their effectiveness in multi-class imbalanced data classification, with respect to the base classifiers and various aggregation schemes for each of the strategies. We compare the performance of these approaches and try to boost the performance of seemingly weaker methods by sampling algorithms. The detailed comparative experimental study of the considered methods, supported by the statistical analysis, is presented. The results show the differences among various binarization strategies. We show how one can mitigate those differences using simple oversampling methods.","Żak, Michał; Woźniak, Michał",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7303687/,695
36351,Polymake.jl: A New Interface to polymake,2020-06-06,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Secreted frizzled-related protein 2 (sFRP2) has been reported to be involved in cardiovascular diseases. However, its role in cardiac hypertrophy induced by pressure overload is still elusive. We aimed to examine the role of sFRP2 in the development of cardiac hypertrophy in vivo and in vitro. METHODS AND RESULTS: Following cardiac hypertrophy stimulated by aortic banding (AB), the expression of sFRP2 was downregulated in the hypertrophic ventricle. Adeno-associated virus 9 (AAV9) was injected through the tail vein to overexpress sFRP2 in the mouse myocardium. Overexpression of sFRP2 alleviated cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and interstitial fibrosis, as identified by the reduced cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area, heart weight/body weight ratio, and left ventricular (LV) collagen ratio. Additionally, sFRP2 decreased cardiomyocyte apoptosis induced by pressure overload. Western blot showed that sFRP2 prevented the expression of active β-catenin. The Wnt/β-catenin agonist LiCl (1 mmol/kg) abolished the inhibitory effects of sFRP2 on cardiac hypertrophy and apoptosis, as evidenced by the increased cross-sectional area and LV collagen ratio and the deterioration of echocardiographic data. CONCLUSION: Our study indicated that decreased sFRP2 levels were observed in failing mouse hearts. Overexpression of sFRP2 attenuated myocyte hypertrophy and interstitial fibrosis induced by hypertrophic stimuli by inhibiting the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. We revealed that sFRP2 may be a promising therapeutic target for the development of cardiac remodeling.

By drawing on the concept of brands being defined collectively through an assemblage of heterogonous human and nonhuman actors, and focusing on the brand Airbnb—a peer-to-peer online platform for renting, swapping, and lending accommodations—the current study examines how consumers’ perceptions of Airbnb brand equity mediate the relationship between functional and hedonic brand image and social media behavioral engagement in terms of consumption, contribution, and creation of brand-related content (COBRAs). Results discriminate between direct and indirect effects. Findings reveal that hedonic brand image directly influences behavioral engagement on social media, whereas brand equity fully mediates the relationship between functional brand image and COBRAs. Implications for theory and practice related to shared or collaborative consumption platforms in the hospitality industry are discussed and suggestions for future studies are presented.

This study aimed to examine how TDC and caregivers live at home and identify their difficulties and needs regarding home care with few services to support them. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted in a tertiary hospital for children in South Korea. A self-reported questionnaire was completed by primary caregivers of TDC who were younger than 19 years and had been dependent on medical devices for more than 3 months. Technologies included home mechanical ventilation, oxygen supplementation, suction equipment, enteral feeding tube, and home total parenteral nutrition. Patterns of healthcare use and home care of TDC and caregivers’ perception toward child were assessed. RESULTS: A total of 74 primary caregivers of TDC completed a self-reported questionnaire. About 60% children were aged under 5 years. There were 31.1% children who required both respiratory and nutritional support. On average, caregivers took care of a child for 14.4 (±6.1) hours, slept for 5.6 (±1.6) hours, and spent 2.4 h per day on personal activities. Children used hospital services for 41.3 (±45.6) days in 6 months, and most (78.1%) were transported through private car/ambulance. Participants (75.6%) reported taking more than an hour to get to the hospital. More than 80% of caregivers responded that child care is physically very burdensome. The only statistically significant relationships was between economic status and financial burden (p = 0.026). CONCLUSIONS: Caregivers of TDC reported having significant time pressure regarding childcare-related tasks, insufficient time for personal activities, and inefficient hospital use because of inadequate medical services to support them in South Korea.

Increasing number of the infected personnel and shortage of real-time transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) as well as its lower sensitivity made the CT a backbone in diagnosis, assessment of severity, and follow-up of the cases. RESULTS: Two hundred forty patients were evaluated retrospectively for clinical, laboratory, and radiological expression in COVID-19 infection. One hundred eighty-six non-severe cases with home isolation and outpatient treatment and 54 severe cases needed hospitalization and oxygen support. Significant difference between both groups was encountered regarding the age, male gender, > 38° fever, dyspnea, chest pain, hypertension, ≤ 93 oxygen saturation, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, elevated D-dimer, high serum ferritin and troponin levels, and high CT-severity score (CT-SS) of the severe group. CT-SS showed a negative correlation with O(2) saturation and patients’ outcome (r − 0.73/p 0.001 and r − 0.56/p 0.001, respectively). Bilateral peripherally distributed ground glass opacities (GGOs) were the commonest imaging feature similar to the literature. CONCLUSION: Older age, male gender, smoking, hypertension, low O(2) saturation, increased CT score, high serum ferritin, and high D-dimer level are the most significant risk factors for severe COVID-19 pneumonia.

42687,Modular Inference of Linear Types for Multiplicity-Annotated Arrows,2020-04-18,"BACKGROUND: Flow-controlled ventilation is a novel ventilation method which allows to individualize ventilation according to dynamic lung mechanic limits based on direct tracheal pressure measurement at a stable constant gas flow during inspiration and expiration. The aim of this porcine study was to compare individualized flow-controlled ventilation (FCV) and current guideline-conform pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV) in long-term ventilation. METHODS: Anesthetized pigs were ventilated with either FCV or PCV over a period of 10 h with a fixed FiO(2) of 0.3. FCV settings were individualized by compliance-guided positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and peak pressure (P(peak)) titration. Flow was adjusted to maintain normocapnia and the inspiration to expiration ratio (I:E ratio) was set at 1:1. PCV was performed with a PEEP of 5 cm H(2)O and P(peak) was set to achieve a tidal volume (V(T)) of 7 ml/kg. The respiratory rate was adjusted to maintain normocapnia and the I:E ratio was set at 1:1.5. Repeated measurements during observation period were assessed by linear mixed-effects model. RESULTS: In FCV (n = 6), respiratory minute volume was significantly reduced (6.0 vs 12.7, MD − 6.8 (− 8.2 to − 5.4) l/min; p < 0.001) as compared to PCV (n = 6). Oxygenation was improved in the FCV group (paO(2) 119.8 vs 96.6, MD 23.2 (9.0 to 37.5) Torr; 15.97 vs 12.87, MD 3.10 (1.19 to 5.00) kPa; p = 0.010) and CO(2) removal was more efficient (paCO(2) 40.1 vs 44.9, MD − 4.7 (− 7.4 to − 2.0) Torr; 5.35 vs 5.98, MD − 0.63 (− 0.99 to − 0.27) kPa; p = 0.006). P(peak) and driving pressure were comparable in both groups, whereas PEEP was significantly lower in FCV (p = 0.002). Computed tomography revealed a significant reduction in non-aerated lung tissue in individualized FCV (p = 0.026) and no significant difference in overdistended lung tissue, although a significantly higher V(T) was applied (8.2 vs 7.6, MD 0.7 (0.2 to 1.2) ml/kg; p = 0.025). CONCLUSION: Our long-term ventilation study demonstrates the applicability of a compliance-guided individualization of FCV settings, which resulted in significantly improved gas exchange and lung tissue aeration without signs of overinflation as compared to best clinical practice PCV.","Spraider, Patrick; Martini, Judith; Abram, Julia; Putzer, Gabriel; Glodny, Bernhard; Hell, Tobias; Barnes, Tom; Enk, Dietmar",Crit Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7686826/,695
42688,ARMv8-A System Semantics: Instruction Fetch in Relaxed Architectures,2020-04-18,"BACKGROUND: Community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP) can lead to sepsis and is associated with high mortality rates in patients presenting with shock and/or respiratory failure and who require mechanical ventilation and admission to intensive care units, thus reflecting the limited effectiveness of current therapy. Preclinical studies support the efficacy of expanded allogeneic adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (eASCs) in the treatment of sepsis. In this study, we aim to test the safety, tolerability and efficacy of eASCs as adjunctive therapy in patients with severe CABP (sCABP). METHODS: In addition to standard of care according to local guidelines, we will administer eASCs (Cx611) or placebo intravenously as adjunctive therapy to patients with sCABP. Enrolment is planned for approximately 180 patients who will be randomised to treatment groups in a 1:1 ratio according to a pre-defined randomization list. An equal number of patients is planned for allocation to each group. Cx611 will be administered on Day 1 and on Day 3 at a dose of 160 million cells (2 million cells / mL, total volume 80 mL) through a 20–30 min (240 mL/hr) intravenous (IV) central line infusion after dilution with Ringer Lactate solution. Placebo (Ringer Lactate) will also be administered through a 20–30 min (240 mL/hr) IV central line infusion at the same quantity (total volume of 80 mL) and following the same schedule as the active treatment. The study was initiated in January 2017 and approved by competent authorities and ethics committees in Belgium, Spain, Lithuania, Italy, Norway and France; monitoring will be performed at regular intervals. Funding is from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Program. DISCUSSION: SEPCELL is the first trial to assess the effects of eASCs in sCABP. The data generated will advance understanding of the mode of action of Cx611 and will provide evidence on the safety, tolerability and efficacy of Cx611 in patients with sCABP.

42694,Modular Relaxed Dependencies in Weak Memory Concurrency,2020-04-18,"BACKGROUND: Ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP) is a widespread accepted platform for preservation and evaluation of donor lungs prior to lung transplantation (LTx). Standard lungs are ventilated using volume-controlled ventilation (VCV). We investigated the effects of flow-controlled ventilation (FCV) in a large animal EVLP model. Fourteen porcine lungs were mounted on EVLP after a warm ischemic interval of 2 h and randomized in two groups (n = 7/group). In VCV, 7 grafts were conventionally ventilated and in FCV, 7 grafts were ventilated by flow-controlled ventilation. EVLP physiologic parameters (compliance, pulmonary vascular resistance and oxygenation) were recorded hourly. After 6 h of EVLP, broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) was performed and biopsies for wet-to-dry weight (W/D) ratio and histology were taken. The left lung was inflated, frozen in liquid nitrogen vapors and scanned with computed tomography (CT) to assess regional distribution of Hounsfield units (HU). RESULTS: All lungs endured 6 h of EVLP. Oxygenation was better in FCV compared to VCV (p = 0.01) and the decrease in lung compliance was less in FCV (p = 0.03). W/D ratio, pathology and BAL samples did not differ between both groups (p = 0.16, p = 0.55 and p = 0.62). Overall, CT densities tended to be less pronounced in FCV (p = 0.05). Distribution of CT densities revealed a higher proportion of well-aerated lung parts in FCV compared to VCV (p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: FCV in pulmonary grafts mounted on EVLP is feasible and leads to improved oxygenation and alveolar recruitment. This ventilation strategy might prolong EVLP over time, with less risk for volutrauma and atelectrauma.","Ordies, Sofie; Orlitova, Michaela; Heigl, Tobias; Sacreas, Annelore; Van Herck, Anke; Kaes, Janne; Saez, Berta; Vanstapel, Arno; Ceulemans, Laurens; Vanaudenaerde, Bart M.; Vos, Robin; Verschakelen, Johny; Verleden, Geert M.; Verleden, Stijn E.; Van Raemdonck, Dirk E.; Neyrinck, Arne P.",Intensive Care Med Exp,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7686942/,695
42695,Liberate Abstract Garbage Collection from the Stack by Decomposing the Heap,2020-04-18,"BACKGROUND: We anticipate large efficacy trials of novel HIV vaccines that have shown acceptable safety profiles. We determined willingness to participate (WTP) in future HIV vaccine efficacy trials among HIV negative female sex workers (FSWs) in Kampala Uganda. METHODS: We conducted a case control study in the Good Health for Women Project cohort. Cases received HIV prevention services and, enrolled in a 12-month simulated vaccine efficacy trial (SiVET) that used Hepatitis B vaccine; they underwent vaccine trial procedures as would be in an actual trial. Controls received similar health services but did not enroll in SiVET. We matched cases and controls (ratio 2:1) for age and duration in the cohort. We described a hypothetical HIV vaccine trial to cases (after 9 months in SiVET) and controls including trial attributes: randomization, delaying pregnancy, frequent blood draws (80-100mls) and study visits for 3 years. We compared WTP and willingness for vaccine trial attributes by case/control using chi-squared or Fisher’s exact tests and fitted conditional logistic regression models to determine independent predictors of WTP. RESULTS: We analyzed data for 311 volunteers (219 cases, 92 controls); median age 27 years (IQR: 23–32), 39.9% had ≥secondary education, 57.9% had sex work as their main job and 81.9% used illicit drugs. Compared to controls, more cases had lived in the community for > 1 year, (85.4% vs 64.1%; p < 0.001) and fewer cases reported illicit drug use in the past 3 months, (79.0% vs 89.1%; p = 0.03). Overall, 278 (89.4%) volunteers expressed WTP in an HIV vaccine trial, the most common reason being hope of protection against HIV. More cases than controls (58.2% vs 44.7%) did not need to consult anyone before trial participation (p = 0.03); cases were more willing to delay pregnancy (99.0% vs 94.0%; p = 0.03). Combining vaccine trial attributes, 249 (89.6%) of the 278 accepted all attributes. After controlling for case/ control status women with secondary education or higher expressed less WTP (aOR 0.17; 95% CI 0.04–0.80). CONCLUSION: FSWs in Kampala demonstrated high WTP. Prior experience with trial requirements like contraception may improve their uptake during actual trials. Family involvement is important for those without prior trial experience.","Mayanja, Yunia; Abaasa, Andrew; Namale, Gertrude; Price, Matt A.; Kamali, Anatoli",BMC Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7686944/,695

42700,Mixed Sessions,2020-04-18,"Odisha is among handful of states that is at the forefront of India’s fight against a rapidly growing COVID-19 pandemic. Even before the national lockdown was imposed by the Union government on March 24, Odisha was only state to have imposed partial lockdown in select districts. It was also first state that took proactive steps to ramp up its health care system particularly having a COVID-19 hospital with intensive care units (ICUs) on public–private partnership mode. Importantly, Odisha was among few states to have created a COVID-19 hospital at each district in record time. In addition, the state took many proactive measures including setting up a taskforce to oversee the COVID-19 response, put up a critical information and communication system with daily press briefings among others to stay on the top of pandemic management. But come May when the migrants rush unfolded, the state experienced steady surge in infections as the pandemic started spreading to relatively dense rural hinterlands. The migrant endowed districts like Ganjam became the epicentres of new spread and the state is struggling to rein on the growing pandemic. What led to the state losing its initial gains? How did the state manage it so ably in the initial period and what led to the surge? What are the unique features of Odisha’s pandemic response? Is there an Odisha Model as claimed by several observers?

The work aims to study the incidence and the clinical significance of detecting unusual gallbladder findings upon the RHPE of the referred cholecystectomy specimens to a histopathology laboratory section at a referral hospital in Saudi Arabia during one year period. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From May 2019 to May 2020, all histopathology reports of 444 consecutive gallbladder specimens after elective and emergency cholecystectomies were retrospectively analyzed and divided into two groups; usual findings and unusual findings which were reviewed blindly by two other pathology consultants. Frequencies, descriptive statistics, normality test, and correlations were run. The Interrater reliability between clinical and histopathological diagnosis was assessed statistically by kappa test. RESULTS: The results of histopathological examination of these gallbladder specimens showed that chronic cholecystitis was found in 296 out of 444 total cases (66.7%), acute cholecystitis in 52 cases (11.7%), and other associated usual findings in 85 cases (19%). Three cases (0.7%) of incidental carcinomas and other three cases (0.7%) of dysplasia. Eosinophilic carcinomas were detected in two cases (0.45%), gallbladder complete septum was found in one case, and one case of Phrygian cap anomaly. All patients with gallbladder carcinoma were diagnosed incidentally during the histopathological examination. CONCLUSIONS: RHPE of cholecystectomy materials are required to confirm the final diagnosis and document any other pathology. Failure to detect incidental occult carcinoma may be catastrophic, given the poor prognosis.","Hasan, Abdulkarim; Nafie, Khalid; Aldossary, Mohammed Yousef; Ismail, Amal; Monazea, Khaled; Baheeg, Mohamad; Rady, Kamal; Elhawary, Reda; Ibrahim, Adel A.",Ann Med Surg (Lond),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7677112/,695

We aimed to provide information about postintensive care syndrome and to learn which patients would pursue help in a Critical Illness Recovery Clinic. All patients who checked in to our Lung Center were given a survey regarding their ICU experience and offered information about postintensive care syndrome and an appointment in the clinic. Nine hundred and twenty respondents reported having had an ICU experience: 37% of former ICU patients reported difficulty returning to their normal lives afterward compared with 21% who were family or close friends of a former ICU patient. Only 5% requested information and less than 1% requested a dedicated appointment. More than one of three former ICU patients and one in five close friends or relatives of former ICU patients reported difficulty returning to their normal lives after their ICU experience.

42706,RustHorn: CHC-Based Verification for Rust Programs,2020-04-18,"We study a financial market where the risky asset is modelled by a geometric Itô-Lévy process, with a singular drift term. This can for example model a situation where the asset price is partially controlled by a company which intervenes when the price is reaching a certain lower barrier. See e.g. Jarrow and Protter (J Bank Finan 29:2803–2820, 2005) for an explanation and discussion of this model in the Brownian motion case. As already pointed out by Karatzas and Shreve (Methods of Mathematical Finance, Springer, Berlin, 1998) (in the continuous setting), this allows for arbitrages in the market. However, the situation in the case of jumps is not clear. Moreover, it is not clear what happens if there is a delay in the system. In this paper we consider a jump diffusion market model with a singular drift term modelled as the local time of a given process, and with a delay [Formula: see text] in the information flow available for the trader. We allow the stock price dynamics to depend on both a continuous process (Brownian motion) and a jump process (Poisson random measure). We believe that jumps and delays are essential in order to get more realistic financial market models. Using white noise calculus we compute explicitly the optimal consumption rate and portfolio in this case and we show that the maximal value is finite as long as [Formula: see text] . This implies that there is no arbitrage in the market in that case. However, when [Formula: see text] goes to 0, the value goes to infinity. This is in agreement with the above result that is an arbitrage when there is no delay. Our model is also relevant for high frequency trading issues. This is because high frequency trading often leads to intensive trading taking place on close to infinitesimal lengths of time, which in the limit corresponds to trading on time sets of measure 0. This may in turn lead to a singular drift in the pricing dynamics. See e.g. Lachapelle et al. (Math Finan Econom 10(3):223–262, 2016) and the references therein.","Agram, Nacira; Øksendal, Bernt",Math Finan Econ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7688205/,695

The main issues that arise when modelling service applications and their interactions are as follows: support of composite types and indexed arrays, describing operations on top of them. It is also important to note the problem of using global time in model combinations – it is hard to describe different levels of abstraction. For example, to combine the network behaviour such as delays, duplication, and packet loss and its effects on business logic. To solve all of these problems, we propose a new model of a service-oriented Petri net (SOPN). It is built based on the stochastic Petri net (SPN) by adding some restrictions and extension components. We added tools for creating data structures, fundamental types such as integers, rational numbers, ordered arrays. The model presented in this paper provides the toolkit for creating complex atomic operations in terms of model-controlled time. Meanwhile, for all the new components and features transition to the basic SPN model is supported.","Iakushkin, Oleg",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7975057/,695

Existing approaches mainly focus on function recognition ignoring the recovery of the relationships between functions, which makes the researchers hard to locate the calling routine they are interested in. In this paper, we propose a method using graphlet edge embedding to abstract high-level topology features of function call graphs and recover the relationships between functions. With the recovery of function relationships, we reconstruct the calling routine of the program and then infer the specific functions in it. We implement a prototype model called RouAlign, which can automatically align the trunk routine of assembly codes. We evaluated RouAlign on 65 groups of real-world programs, with over two million functions. RouAlign outperforms state-of-the-art binary comparing solutions by over 35% with a high precision of 92% on average in pairwise function recognition.","Yang, Can; Liu, Jian; Luo, Mengxia; Gong, Xiaorui; Liu, Baoxu",ICT Systems Security and Privacy Protection,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7978991/,695

Paradoxically, the recent episodes in the “Washington drama” hold captive and “entertain” global audiences. This is due to the changes in and appeal of contemporary forms of globally disseminated popular culture, digital formats, and social media platforms. It is suggested that the US enjoys a unique but dramatic fame-based status and influence. This appeal is also a vulnerability.

In the course of the last ten years these three countries negotiated and signed very ambitious Association Agreements, which promise enhanced bilateral relations but without an explicit offer of EU membership on the horizon. At the same time, the signals coming from Kyiv, Tbilisi and (occasionally) Chișinău indicate that the choice of a pro-EU trajectory is there to stay. With this in mind the analysis looks at the heart of the Association Agreements, that is, law approximation and, in broader terms, the way in which the association is developing. The author argues that the EU is reaching a point when, as in any close relationship, it will have to make its future intentions clear. Towards the end of the chapter a few suggestions as to the next steps forward are made. The easiest, and the most do-able option is to regularly update the lists of the EU acquis pencilled in for approximation. Furthermore, the relations could be upgraded by a reformed institutional framework, potentially modelled on the draft EU-Swiss Institutional Agreement and the EU-UK Withdrawal Agreement. The parties may also wish to explore additional areas of co-operation, going beyond the current parameters of the Association Agreements. The EU also needs to be prepared that at some point in the future applications for membership may arrive.","Łazowski, A.",The Evolving Nature of EU External Relations Law,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7981558/,695

This study developed an efficient protocol for regenerating shoots from leaf explants using Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with different concentrations of plant growth regulators (PGRs), which play vital roles in shoot regeneration. The best result, 86.67% induction frequency and 4.35 shoots per explant, was obtained in the MS medium containing 2.0 mg/L N6-benzyladenine (BA) and 0.05 mg/L indole-3-butyric acid. The effects of explant age, orientation, and genotype were also investigated. Explants from young leaves had a greater regeneration frequency than those from old leaves, and the results were better when the distal end of the leaf explant contacted the medium versus the proximal end. Approximately 70.96% of the shoots rooted well in the MS medium containing 0.4 mg/L α-naphthalene acetic acid (NAA). Although some genotypes achieved poorer results, the regeneration protocol is still applicable for mass multiplication and genetic transformation.","Cui, Siming; Ren, Ying; Hao, Yahan; Zhang, Junjie; Chen, Zhouchao; Zou, Jintuo; Zhou, Wei; Chen, Xiaoyang",Open Life Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7874615/,695

In this context, territorially bounded and well delimited urban cells, globally known as ‘gated communities’, xiaoqu, continued to define the very essence of Chinese cities becoming the most attractive urban form for city planners, real estate developers, and citizens alike. Considering the guidelines in China’s National New Urbanization Plan (2014–2020), focusing on the promotion of humanistic and harmonious cities, in addition to the directive of 2016 by China’s Central Urban Work Conference to open up the gates and ban the construction of new enclosed residential compounds, this paper raises the following questions: As the matrix of the Chinese urban fabric, what would be the role of the gated communities in China’s desire for a human-qualitative urbanism? And How to rethink the gated communities to meet the new urban challenges? Seeking alternative perspectives, this paper looks at the gated communities beyond the apparent limits they seem to represent, considering them not simply as the ‘cancer’ of Chinese cities, rather the container of the primary ingredients to reshape the urban fabric dominated by the gate.","Hamama, Badiaa; Liu, Jian",City Territ Archit,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7570397/,695

However, no study has examined the cytotoxic and anti-metastatic efficacy of Selaginella repanda (S. repanda) to date. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the potential anti-metastatic properties of ethanol crude extract of S. repanda in human non-small-cell lung (A-549) and colorectal cancer (HCT-116) cells with possible mechanisms. Effect of S. repanda crude extract on the growth, adhesion, migration and invasion of the A-549 and HCT-116 were investigated. We demonstrated that S. repanda crude extract inhibited cell growth of metastatic cells in a dose and time dependent manner. Incubation of A-549 and HCT-116 cells with 100–500 µg/mL of S. repanda crude extract significantly inhibited cell adhesion to gelatin coated surface. In the migration and invasion assay, S. repanda crude extract also significantly inhibited cellular migration and invasion in both A-549 and HCT-116 cells. Moreover, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and real-time PCR (RT-PCR) analysis revealed that the activity and mRNA level of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and membrane type 1-matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) were inhibited. While the activity of tissue inhibitor matrix metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP-1); an inhibitor of MMPs was stimulated by S. repanda crude extract in a concentration-dependent manner. Therefore, the present study not only indicated the inhibition of motility and invasion of malignant cells by S. repanda, but also revealed that such effects were likely associated with the decrease in MMP-2/-9 expression of both A-549 and HCT-116 cells. This further suggests that S. repanda could be used as a potential source of anti-metastasis agent in pharmaceutical development for cancer therapy.","Adnan, Mohd; Siddiqui, Arif Jamal; Hamadou, Walid Sabri; Snoussi, Mejdi; Badraoui, Riadh; Ashraf, Syed Amir; Jamal, Arshad; Awadelkareem, Amir Mahgoub; Sachidanandan, Manojkumar; Hadi, Sibte; Khan, Mushtaq Ahmad; Patel, Mitesh",Plants (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8156211/,695

However, LBPs’ persistence in the intestine is heterogeneous since many beneficial bacteria lack mechanisms to tolerate the inflammation and the oxidative stress associated with IBD. We rationalized that optimizing LBPs with enhanced colonization and persistence in the inflamed intestine would help beneficial bacteria increase their bioavailability and sustain their beneficial responses. Our lab developed two bioengineered LBPs (SBT001/BioPersist and SBT002/BioColoniz) modified to enhance colonization or persistence in the inflamed intestine. In this study, we examined colon-derived metabolites via ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry in colitic mice treated with either BioPersist or BioColoniz as compared to their unmodified parent strains (Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 [EcN] and Lactobacillus reuteri, respectively) or to each other. BioPersist administration resulted in lowered concentrations of inflammatory prostaglandins, decreased stress hormones such as adrenaline and corticosterone, increased serotonin, and decreased bile acid in comparison to EcN. In comparison to BioColoniz, BioPersist increased serotonin and antioxidant production, limited bile acid accumulation, and enhanced tissue restoration via activated purine and pyrimidine metabolism. These data generated several novel hypotheses for the beneficial roles that LBPs may play during colitis.","Ye, Jiayu; Erland, Lauren A.

Data was gathered from 276 healthcare professionals through a survey questionnaire across hospitals in Bahrain. Empirical outcomes reveal nine significant relationships amongst the constructs. The findings show that despite contradictions associated with AI, continuous intention to use behaviour can be predicted during the diffusion of IoMT. This study advances the understanding of the role of responsible AI in the continued use of IoMT in healthcare and extends DOI to address the diffusion of two innovations concurrently.","Al-Dhaen, Fatema; Hou, Jiachen; Rana, Nripendra P.; Weerakkody, Vishanth",Inf Syst Front,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8412855/,695

Recently, various health care providers were hit by ransomware and Distributed Denial of Service attacks during the COVID-19 outbreak. Due to these attacks, many emergency services were halted, affecting hundreds of thousands without any healthcare. Another problem with these traditional database practices is that they often misplace or mix the patient's data, which, needless to say, have severe complications.

167799,"Covid-19: People Activity, Monitoring Development and Environmental Issue",2021,"The dust production in debris discs by grinding collisions of planetesimals requires their orbits to be stirred. However, stirring levels remain largely unconstrained, and consequently the stirring mechanisms as well. This work shows how the sharpness of the outer edge of discs can be used to constrain the stirring levels. Namely, the sharper the edge is the lower the eccentricity dispersion must be. For a Rayleigh distribution of eccentricities ($e$), I find that the disc surface density near the outer edge can be parametrised as $\tanh[(r_{\max}-r)/l_{\rm out}]$, where $r_{\max}$ approximates the maximum semi-major axis and $l_{\rm out}$ defines the edge smoothness. If the semi-major axis distribution has sharp edges $e_\mathrm{rms}$ is roughly $1.2 l_{\rm out}/r_{\max}$, or $e_\mathrm{rms}=0.77 l_{\rm out}/r_{\max}$ if semi-major axes have diffused due to self-stirring. This model is fitted to ALMA data of five wide discs: HD 107146, HD 92945, HD 206893, AU Mic and HR 8799. The results show that HD 107146, HD 92945 and AU Mic have the sharpest outer edges, corresponding to $e_\mathrm{rms}$ values of $0.121\pm0.05$, $0.15^{+0.07}_{-0.05}$ and $0.10\pm0.02$ if their discs are self-stirred, suggesting the presence of Pluto-sized objects embedded in the disc. Although these stirring values are larger than typically assumed, the radial stirring of HD 92945 is in good agreement with its vertical stirring constrained by the disc height. HD 206893 and HR~8799, on the other hand, have smooth outer edges that are indicative of scattered discs since both systems have massive inner companions.","Marino, Sebastian",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.02072v1.pdf,695
170253,"“…the space wider, I can play ball…”: when children thinking about space",2021,"Background: The outbreak of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is a public health crisis of global proportion. In psoriatic patients treated with biologic agents, evidence is not yet available on susceptibility to infection with the novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, and data about the perception of COVID-19 and its impact on these patients are lacking. Aims: The aim of this observational, spontaneous study was the evaluation of the impact of anti COVID19 measures in & ldquo;fragile population & rdquo;such as patients with a chronic inflammatory disease. Thus, we evaluated the impact of perceived risk on quality of life of patients with moderate to severe psoriasis, in our outpatient clinic, and how their perceptions changed before and after the adoption of Covid-19 emergency measures following the Italian Ministerial Decree in March 9, 2020. Methods: Using a series of questions, our study surveyed adult patients with moderate to severe psoriasis receiving treatment with biologic agents (n = 591), before and after the adoption of COVID-19 emergency measures. Results: Most patients (97%) had been sufficiently informed by healthcare staff about COVID-19 spread. A significant change was observed in social activity reduction before and after the adoption of the measures (18% vs. 90% of patients;P &lt; 0.0001). Similarly, patients were more likely to suspend ongoing therapy after the measures were adopted than before (87% vs. 34% of patients;P &lt; 0.0001). Following the measures, older patients were significantly more inclined to suspend therapy and reduce social activities than younger patients. Conclusions: Government COVID-19 emergency measures further curtailed already reduced social activities in psoriatic patients, and led to a greater inclination to suspend biologic therapy, more so in older patients, despite there being no evidence to support this suspension. These vulnerable patients may need support from clinicians in order to maintain treatment adherence. (c) 2021 The Authors.

There was a huge influx of patients as well as their presentations, and the outcomes. This study intended to document the predicted general information about COVID-19 and patient characteristics. Methodology: All admitting COVID-19 assumed cases were included from March 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020, at the adult emergency departments of Sakarya Training and Research Hospital. Results: A total of 92161 patients presumed to have COVID-19 presented to the emergency room. Out of these, 51719 (56.1%) patients were male, the mean age was 40 y, inpatients' mean age was 63 y;the mean age the patients who died was 74 y. Majority of them [90382 (98.1%)] was Turkish citizens, and 1779 (1.9%) were foreign nationals. Of all patients, 87914 (95.4%) reached the emergency room by their private means, and 4247 (4.6%) arrived by an ambulance. A total of 6154 (6.7%) patients were hospitalised;a meaningful relationship was found between the patients' age and hospitalisation status (p = 0.001). The mortality within the emergency service was 126 (0.1%). The real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests result were positive of 28,847 (31.3%) patients. Conclusion: Approximately 1/3rd of the patients with COVID-19 symptoms had a positive test result, making emergency departments important places for managing the pandemic.

For the first time two thirds of the global aircraft fleet were grounded;airports recorded a decrease of 70-95% in passenger traffic, and many airlines went bankrupt. The negative trends of air traffic operations automatically decrease airport aeronautical and non-aeronautical revenues, bringing airports to the very bottom level of financial survival. However, after several months and after implementing the World Health Organization anti-COVID-19 measures, a small positive trend starts to be seen. The measures that need to be implemented have presented an additional problem for passenger terminal planning and design, especially if the introduction of new subsystems into the existing traffic flow, such as health control, is taken into account. Considering that current international recommendations from IATA ADRM are no longer valid, it is necessary to redefine the traffic flows inside the terminal and adjust the procedures of passengers and baggage handling to the new conditions of social distancing. Following that, ICAO Annex 9 recommendation that passengers need to be processed on departure traffic flow in 60 minutes went under question. New requirements for terminal space to keep passengers on safe distance, the implementation of new contactless technology for quick passenger processing, a thermal camera and health checkpoints, as well as other measures are now “new normal” for the airport business.","Štimac, Igor Pivac Jelena Bračić Matija Drljača Miroslav",International Journal for Traffic and Transport Engineering,https://doi.org/10.7708/ijtte.2021.11(1).08,695

Moreover, the privacy issue of the collected radiograph data and other health data of the patients has also arisen much concern. To address these challenges, in this paper, we envision a federated learning model for COVID-19 prediction from radiograph images acquired by an X-ray device within a mobile and deployable screening resource booth node (RBN). Our envisioned model permits the privacy-preservation of the acquired radiograph by performing localized learning. We further customize the proposed federated learning model by asynchronously updating the shallow and deep model parameters so that precious communication bandwidth can be spared. Based on a real dataset, the effectiveness of our envisioned approach is demonstrated and compared with baseline methods. © 2021 IEEE.","Sakib, S.; Fouda, M.

Odds ratios for vaccine hesitancy after adjustment for age and gender were 13.42 (95% CI:6.86, 26.24) in Black, 2.54 (95% CI:1.19, 5.44) in Pakistani/Bangladeshi groups, and 1.76 (95% CI:1.10, 2.82) for Other White (including Eastern European) ethnic groups (compared to White British/Irish). Vaccine hesitancy was not higher in all minority ethnic groups;for example, ORs were 1.11 (95% CI:0.64, 1.95) for Indian ethnicity and 0.67 (95% CI:0.24, 1.87) for Other Asian (including Chinese) ethnicity. Lower education was also related to vaccine hesitancy (no qualifications versus degree OR 3.54;95% CI:2.06, 6.09) but ethnic differences largely remained when education was included in the model. For those who were vaccine hesitant the most common stated reason for hesitancy was concerns over unknown future effects (42.7%). However, when compared to the White British/Irish group, Black participants were more likely to state they ‘Don’t trust vaccines’ (29.2% vs 5.7%) and the Pakistani/Bangladeshi ethnic group more frequently cited worries about side-effects (35.4% vs 8.6%).ConclusionVaccine hesitancy is strongly associated with education and ethnicity, with marked ethnic heterogeneity. Black and Pakistani/Bangladeshi participants reported considerably greater vaccine hesitancy than White British/Irish ethnicity, but some minority ethnic groups did not. Educational inequalities did not account for ethnic differences. Vaccine programmes need to understand reasons for vaccine hesitancy within specific population sub-groups and take urgent action to improve uptake.","Robertson, Elaine Reeve Kelly S.; Niedzwiedz, Claire L.; Moore, Jamie Blake Margaret Green Michael J.; Katikireddi, S.

178382,Contactless Distribution mode based on Circular Express Box,2020,"Instagram Live has become a useful tool for maintaining celebrity and continuing to generate engagement, one that many celebrities turned to during COVID-19 shut-downs. Among them, Sue Bird and Megan Rapinoe, the women's sports power-couple, used Instagram Live to create a weekly talk-show that would eventually be titled A Touch More. The Instagram Live platform provided the unpredictability of liveness and enabled Bird and Rapinoe to perform intimacy and authenticity as part of their celebrity persona maintenance during a time of increased precarity for their sports and thus their main avenue for fame. This article analyzes how Instagram Live - in relation to Instagram and Instagram Stories - operates as a locus of celebrity performance of authenticity and intimacy with A Touch More as the case study. Further, by exploring the construction of Bird and Rapinoe's individual and coupled celebrity personas as fundamentally connected to the gendered precarity of their sports, I argue that even with their superstar status, Bird and Rapinoe's cultivated intimacy in A Touch More was, in essence, a market necessity.","Howell, C.

182242,"Mega-events, expansion and prospects: Perceptions of Euro 2020 and its 12-country hosting format",2021,"In this paper we consider a new type of space partitioning which bridges the gap between continuous and discrete spaces in an error resilient way. It is motivated by the problem of rounding noisy measurements from some continuous space such as ℝd to a discrete subset of representative values, in which each tile in the partition is defined as the preimage of one of the output points. Standard rounding schemes seem to be inherently discontinuous across tile boundaries, but in this paper we show how to make it perfectly consistent (with error resilience ∈) by guaranteeing that any pair of consecutive measurements X1 and X2 whose L2 distance is bounded by ∈ will be rounded to the same nearby representative point in the discrete output space. We achieve this resilience by allowing a few bits of information about the first measurement X1 to be unidirectionally communicated to and used by the rounding process of the second measurement X2. Minimizing this revealed information can be particularly important in privacy-sensitive applications such as COVID-19 contact tracing, in which we want to find out all the cases in which two persons were at roughly the same place at roughly the same time, by comparing cryptographically hashed versions of their itineraries in an error resilient way. The main problem we study in this paper is characterizing the achievable tradeoffs between the amount of information provided and the error resilience for various dimensions. We analyze the problem by considering the possible colored tilings of the space with k available colors, and use the color of the tile in which X1 resides as the side information. We obtain our upper and lower bounds with a variety of techniques including isoperimetric inequalities, the Brunn-Minkowski theorem, sphere packing bounds, Sperner's lemma, and Cech cohomology. In particular, we show that when Xi ∈ ℝd, communicating log2(d + 1) bits of information is both sufficient and necessary (in the worst case) to achieve positive resilience, and when d=3 we obtain a tight upper and lower asymptotic bound of (0.561⋯)k1/3 on the achievable error resilience when we provide log2(k) bits of information about X1's color. © 2021 Orr Dunkelman, Zeev Geyzel, Chaya Keller, Nathan Keller, Eyal Ronen, Adi Shamir, and Ran J.

199107,The Effect of COVID-19 Pandemic on Plastic Surgery Practice in a Tertiary Health Care Center in Egypt,2021,"Using isogenic recombinant murine coronaviruses expressing wild-type murine hepatitis virus strain 4 (MHV-4) or MHV-A59 spike glycoproteins or chimeric MHV-4/MHV-A59 spike glycoproteins, we have demonstrated the biological functionality of the N-terminus of the spike, encompassing the receptor binding domain (RBD). We have used two assays, one an in vitro liposome binding assay and the other a tissue culture replication assay. The liposome binding assay shows that interaction of the receptor with spikes on virions at 37 degrees C causes a conformational change that makes the virions hydrophobic so that they bind to liposomes (B. D. Zelus, J. H. Schickli, D. M. Blau, S. R. Weiss, and K. V. Holmes, J. Virol. 77: 830-840, 2003). Recombinant viruses with spikes containing the RBD of either MHV-A59 or MHV-4 readily associated with liposomes at 37 degrees C in the presence of soluble mCEACAM1(a), except for S(4)R, which expresses the entire wild-type MHV-4 spike and associated only inefficiently with liposomes following incubation with soluble mCEACAM1(a). In contrast, soluble mCEACAM1(b) allowed viruses with the MHV-A59 RBD to associate with liposomes more efficiently than did viruses with the MHV-4 RBD. In the second assay, which requires virus entry and replication, all recombinant viruses replicated efficiently in BHK cells expressing mCEACAM1(a). In BHK cells expressing mCEACAM1(b), only viruses expressing chimeric spikes with the MHV-A59 RBD could replicate, while replication of viruses expressing chimeric spikes with the MHV-4 RBD was undetectable. Despite having the MHV-4 RBD, S(4)R replicated in BHK cells expressing mCEACAM1(b); this is most probably due to spread via CEACAM1 receptor-independent cell-to-cell fusion, an activity displayed only by S(4)R among the recombinant viruses studied here. These data suggest that the RBD domain and the rest of the spike must coevolve to optimize function in viral entry and spread.","Tsai, Jean C; Zelus, Bruce D; Holmes, Kathryn V; Weiss, Susan R",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12502800/,695
206310,The inertia effect of lockdown: Managing the new normal,2020,"The ongoing worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has been one of the most significant challenges to humankind in centuries. The extremely contagious nature of the SARS-CoV-2 virus has put forth an immense pressure on the health sector. In order to mitigate the stress on the healthcare systems especially to battle the crisis of mechanical ventilators, we have designed a modular, and robust DIY ventilator, ATMO-Vent (Atmospheric Mixture Optimization Ventilator) which can be fully mounted within two days by two operators. The ATMO-Vent has been designed using low-cost, robust, Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) components, with many features comparable to a full-fledged ventilator. ATMO-Vent has been designed based on the United Kingdom Medicines & Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (UK-MHRA) guidelines for Rapidly Manufactured Ventilator System (RMVS), yet scalable to the specific requirements of different countries. ATMO-Vent is capable of adjusting the Fraction of Inspiratory Oxygen (FiO2) levels, Tidal Volume (TV), frequency of breaths, Inspiratory/Expiratory ratio (I/E), Peak Inspiratory Pressure (PIP) and Positive End-Expiratory Pressure (PEEP). ATMO-Vent can operate in two modes - Continuous Mandatory Ventilation (CMV) using Volume-Controlled Ventilation (VCV) and in Assisted Control (AC) mode with pressure triggered by the patient. ATMO-Vent has undergone rigorous testing and qualifies under Class B Electric and Magnetic Compatibility (EMC) requirements of EN 55011 CISPR 11 standards.","Mathanlal, Thasshwin; Israel Nazarious, Miracle; Mantas-Nakhai, Roberto; Zorzano, Maria-Paz; Martin-Torres, Javier",HardwareX,,695

The European and African Hepato-Pancreato-Biliary Association (E-AHPBA), the premier representative body for practicing HPB surgeons in Europe and Africa, conducted this survey to assess the impact of COVID-19 on HPB surgery. METHODS: An online survey was disseminated to all E-AHPBA members to assess the effects of the pandemic on unit capacity, management of HPB cancers, use of COVID-19 screening and other aspects of service delivery. RESULTS: Overall, 145 (25%) members responded. Most units, particularly in COVID-high countries (>100,000 cases) reported insufficient critical care capacity and reduced HPB operating sessions compared to COVID-low countries. Delayed access to cancer surgery necessitated alternatives including increased neoadjuvant chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer and colorectal liver metastases, and locoregional treatments for hepatocellular carcinoma. Other aspects of service delivery including COVID-19 screening and personal protective equipment varied between units and countries. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that the COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound adverse impact on the delivery of HPB cancer care across the continents of Europe and Africa. The findings illustrate the need for safe resumption of cancer surgery in a ""new"" normal world with screening of patients and staff for COVID-19.","Balakrishnan, Anita; Lesurtel, Mickael; Siriwardena, Ajith K; Heinrich, Stefan; Serrablo, Alejandro; Besselink, Marc G H; Erkan, Mert; Andersson, Bodil; Polak, Wojciech G; Laurenzi, Andrea; Olde Damink, Stefan W M; Berrevoet, Frederik; Frigerio, Isabella; Ramia, Jose M; Gallagher, Thomas K; Warner, Susanne; Shrikhande, Shailesh V; Adam, Rene; Smith, Martin D; Conlon, Kevin C",HPB (Oxford),,695

Analyzing the impact of COVID-19 on private practice,2021,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the degree of hypoxia and subjective dyspnea elicited by a 6-minute walking test (6MWT) in COVID-19 patients prior to discharge. METHODS: A 6MWT was performed in 26 discharge-ready COVID-19 patients without chronic pulmonary disease or cardiac failure. Heart rate, oxyhemoglobin saturation (SpO2), respiratory rate, and subjective dyspnea measured on the Borg CR-10 scale were measured before and immediately after the 6MWT, with continuous monitoring of SpO2 and heart rate during the 6MWT. The 6MWT was terminated if SpO2 dropped below 90%. A historical cohort of 204 patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) was used for comparison. RESULTS: 13 (50%) of the COVID-19 patients developed exercise-induced hypoxia (SpO2 < 90%) during the 6MWT, of which one third had pulmonary embolism. COVID-19 patients experienced less hypoxia-related dyspnea during the 6MWT compared with patients with IPF. CONCLUSION: The 6MWT is a potential tool in the diagnosis of asymptomatic exercise-induced hypoxia in hospitalized COVID-19 patients prior to discharge. Due to important methodological limitations, further studies are needed to confirm our findings and to investigate their clinical consequences.","Fuglebjerg, Natascha Josephine Ulstrand; Jensen, Tomas Oestergaard; Hoyer, Nils; Ryrsø, Camilla Koch; Lindegaard, Birgitte; Harboe, Zitta Barrella",Int J Infect Dis,,695
219082,Will private plastic surgeons survive the pandemic? Analyzing the impact of COVID-19 on private practice,2021,"Seismic noise with frequencies above 1 Hz is often called cultural noise and is generally correlated quite well with human activities. Recently, cities in mainland China and Italy imposed lockdown restrictions in response to COVID-19, which gave us an unprecedented opportunity to study the relationship between seismic noise above 1 Hz and human activities. Using seismic records from stations in China and Italy, we show that seismic noise above 1 Hz was primarily generated by the local transportation systems. The lockdown of the cities and the imposition of travel restrictions led to a ~4-12 dB energy decrease in seismic noise in mainland China. Data also show that different Chinese cities experienced distinct periods of diminished cultural noise, related to differences in local response to the epidemic. In contrast, there was only ~1-6 dB energy decrease of seismic noise in Italy, after the country was put under a lockdown. The noise data indicate that traffic flow did not decrease as much in Italy, but show how different cities reacted distinctly to the lockdown conditions.","Xiao, Han; Eilon, Zachary; Ji, Chen; Tanimoto, Toshiro",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.00131v1.pdf,695

The purpose of this paper is to characterise growth and metabolic performance of BSF larvae on substrate moisture contents from 45 to 85%. Larvae developed into prepupae only at 45-75% substrate moisture content. Within this interval, the maximal specific growth rate was highest (0.73 day-1), the growth period shortest (13 days), and the maximal dry weight lowest (88 mg) at 45% moisture content. Differences in cost of growth and maintenance were not observed at the different substrate moisture contents, and differences in larval performance were likely associated to differences in co-occurring microbial activities. As much as 22% of the substrate carbon was emitted as CO2 at 45% moisture content by microorganisms, measured as the difference between total respiration and larval respiration, whereas microbial CO2 production amounted to only 3% of the substrate carbon at 75% moisture content. As consequence of the high specific growth rate and short growth phase, the overall net growth efficiency was higher at 45% moisture content (0.62) than at 75% moisture content (0.52). Overall, the metabolic performance of the BSF larvae was insensitive to differences in substrate moisture content. Their performance was, however indirectly affected by the substrate moisture content due to differences in co-occurring microbial processes in the substrate.","Bekker, Nicolai Sundgaard; Heidelbach, Søren; Vestergaard, Sofie Zacho; Nielsen, Morten Eneberg; Riisgaard-Jensen, Marie; Zeuner, Emil Juel; Bahrndorff, Simon; Eriksen, Niels Thomas",Waste Manag,,695

As of October 3, 2020, the number of confirmed cases has been nearly 34 million with more than 1 million fatalities. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is accountable for COVID-19. Newly diagnosed and worsening cardiovascular disease are common complications in COVID-19 patients, including acute cardiac injury, hypertension, arrhythmia, myocardial infarction, heart failure and sudden cardiac arrest. The mechanisms contributing to cardiac disease burden include hypoxemia, inflammatory factor storm, dysfunctional angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and drug-induced cardiac toxicity. Notably, the macrophages expressing ACE2 as direct host cells of SARS-CoV-2 secrete chemokine and inflammatory cytokines, as well as a decrease in cellular immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection due to elevated exhaustion levels and dysfunctional diversity of T cells, that may be accountable for the ""hyperinflammation and cytokine storm syndrome"" and subsequently acute cardiac injury and deteriorating cardiovascular disease in COVID-19 patients. However, no targeted medication or vaccines for COVID-19 are yet available. The management of cardiovascular disease in patients with COVID-19 include general supportive treatment, circulatory support, other symptomatic treatment, psychological assistance as well as online consultation. Further work should be concentrated on better understanding the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and accelerating the development of drugs and vaccines to reduce the cardiac disease burden and promote the management of COVID-19 patients, especially those with a severe disease course and cardiovascular complications.","Li, Guoliang; Saguner, Ardan M; An, Jiaqi; Ning, Yuye; Day, John D; Ding, Ligang; Waintraub, Xavier; Wang, Jie",Cardiol J,,695

Diabetes will affect the prognosis of COVID-19 patients in many ways. Both hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia can affect oxidative stress and lead to the release of inflammatory mediators, leading to multiple organ damage and chronic inflammation. Here, we want to know whether hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia will adversely affect patients with diabetes and COVID-19 comorbidities. This has very important practical significance for the control of blood glucose in the treatment of diabetes combined with SARS-COV-2 infection. METHODS: We will search electronic databases including PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Chinese Science and Technology Periodical Database (VIP), and Wanfang database using keywords related to COVID-19, diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia. We will manually search gray literature, such as conference proceedings and academic degree dissertations, and trial registries. Two independent reviewers will screen studies, extract data, and evaluate risk of bias. Data analysis will be conducted using the Review Manager software version 5.3.5 and STATA4.0 software for Mac. The main outcome was the mortality of COVID-19 which was included in meta-analysis and subgroup analysis. The bias of the study was evaluated independently by NOS scale, and published by funnel chart. The sensitivity was analyzed row by row.

A set of 182 matching questionnaires was collected from first-year undergraduate English as a foreign language learners at two time points of a 16-week semester. Analyses of the data revealed the following major findings: (1) the participants experienced high levels of FLCA and FLLA both at the beginning and end of the semester, neither of which changed significantly during the semester, (2) FLCA and FLLA were highly positively related to each other, (3) FLCA and FLLA significantly predicted students' self-rated proficiency in listening and speaking English, and (4) confidence in using English, efforts and motivation to learn English and interaction with instructors and peers mediated FLCA and FLLA to exert effects on students' self-perceived proficiency in listening and speaking English. These findings indicate that the learning environment is critical in influencing the levels of and changes in FLCA and listening anxiety and that these two types of foreign language anxiety are serious issues in the pandemic foreign language learning context.","Liu, M.

304948,Management and outcomes of mammalian bite injuries during COVID-19 and implications for future practice,2020,"CONTEXT: Diabetes is reported as a risk factor for severe COVID-19, but whether this risk is similar in all categories of age remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes in hospitalized patients with and without diabetes according to age categories. DESIGN SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: We conducted a retrospective observational cohort study of 6,314 consecutive patients hospitalized for COVID-19 between February and June 30 2020, and follow-up recorded until 30 September 2020, in the Paris metropolitan area, France. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): The main outcome was a composite outcome of mortality and orotracheal intubation in subjects with diabetes compared with subjects without diabetes, after adjustment for confounding variables and according to age categories. RESULTS: Diabetes was recorded in 39% of subjects. Main outcome was higher in patients with diabetes, independently of confounding variables (HR 1.13 [1.03-1.24]) and increased with age in individuals without diabetes, from 23% for those <50 to 35% for those >80 years but reached a plateau after 70 in those with diabetes. In direct comparison between patients with and without diabetes, diabetes-associated risk was inversely proportional to age, highest in <50 and similar after 70 years. Similarly, mortality was higher in patients with diabetes (26%) than in those without diabetes (22%, p<0.001), but adjusted HR for diabetes was significant only in patients under 50 (HR 1.81 [1.14-2.87]). CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes should be considered as an independent risk factor for the severity of COVID-19 in young adults more so than in older adults, especially for individuals younger than 70 years.","Diedisheim, Marc; Dancoisne, Etienne; Gautier, Jean-François; Larger, Etienne; Cosson, Emmanuel; Fève, Bruno; Chanson, Philippe; Czernichow, Sébastien; Tatulashvili, Sopio; Raffin-Sanson, Marie-Laure; Bourgeon, Muriel; Ajzenberg, Christiane; Hartemann, Agnès; Daniel, Christel; Moreau, Thomas; Roussel, Ronan; Potier, Louis",J. clin. endocrinol. metab,,695

DESIGN: A descriptive, retrospective report from a single-center PICU. SETTING: Twenty-three bed, quaternary PICU, within an 862-bed hospital. PATIENTS: Critically ill adults, with coronavirus disease 2019-related disease. INTERVENTIONS: ICU care provided by pediatric intensivists with training and support from medical intensivists. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Within the context of the institution's comprehensive effort to centralize and systematize care for adults with severe coronavirus disease 2019 disease, the PICU was transitioned to an adult coronavirus disease 2019 critical care unit. Nurses and physicians underwent just-in-time training over 3 days and 2 weeks, respectively. Medical ICU physicians and nurses provided oversight for care and designated hospital-based teams were available for procedures and common adult emergencies. Over a 7-week period, the PICU cared for 60 adults with coronavirus disease 2019-related critical illness. Fifty-three required intubation and mechanical ventilation for a median of 18 days. Eighteen required renal replacement therapy and 17 died. CONCLUSIONS: During the current and potentially in future pandemics, where critical care resources are limited, pediatric intensivists and staff can be readily utilized to meaningfully contribute to the care of critically ill adults.","Wasserman, Emily; Toal, Megan; Nellis, Marianne E; Traube, Chani; Joyce, Christine; Finkelstein, Robert; Killinger, James S; Joashi, Umesh; Harrington, John S; Torres, Lisa K; Greenwald, Bruce M; Howell, Joy",Pediatric critical care medicine,,695

Screening for testing has been based on symptoms typically observed in inpatients, yet outpatient symptoms may differ. Classification and regression trees recursive partitioning created a decision tree classifying participants into laboratory-confirmed cases and non-cases. Demographic and symptom data from patients ages 18-87 years enrolled from March 29-June 8, 2020 were included. Presence or absence of SARS-CoV-2 was the target variable. Of 832 tested, 77 (9.3%) tested positive. Cases significantly more often reported diarrhea (12 percentage points (PP)), fever (15 PP), nausea/vomiting (9 PP), loss of taste/smell (52 PP), and contact with a COVID-19 case (54 PP), but less frequently reported sore throat (-27 PP). The 4-terminal node optimal tree had sensitivity of 69%, specificity of 78%, positive predictive value of 20%, negative predictive value of 97%, and AUC of 76%. Among those referred for testing, negative responses to two questions could classify about half (49%) of tested persons with low risk for SARS-CoV-2 and would save limited testing resources. Outpatient symptoms of COVID-19 appear to be broader than the inpatient syndrome. Initial supplies of anticipated COVID-19 vaccines may be limited and administration of first such available vaccines may need to be prioritized for essential workers, the most vulnerable, or those likely to have a robust response to vaccine. Another priority group could be those not previously infected. Those who screen out of testing may be less likely to have been infected by SARS-CoV-2 virus thus may be prioritized for vaccination when supplies are limited.","Zimmerman, Richard K; Nowalk, Mary Patricia; Bear, Todd; Taber, Rachel; Clarke, Karen S; Sax, Theresa M; Eng, Heather; Clarke, Lloyd G; Balasubramani, G K",Hum Vaccin Immunother,,695

Currently, long-term data on viral shedding and the serum antibody responses in COVID-19 patients are still limited. Herein, we report the clinical features, viral RNA loads, and serum antibody levels in a cohort of 112 COVID-19 patients admitted to the Honghu People's Hospital, Hubei Province, China. Overall, 5.36% (6/112) of patients showed persistent viral RNA shedding (> 45 days). The peak viral load was higher in the severe disease group than in the mild group (median cycle threshold value, 36.4 versus 31.5; P = 0.002). For most patients the disappearance of IgM antibodies occurred approximately 4-6 weeks after symptoms onset, while IgG persisted for over 194 days after the onset of symptoms, although patients showed a 46% reduction in antibodies titres against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein compared with the acute phase. We also studied 18 asymptomatic individuals with RT-qPCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection together with 17 symptomatic patients, and the asymptomatic individuals were the close contacts of these symptomatic cases. Delayed IgG seroconversion and lower IgM seropositive rates were observed in asymptomatic individuals. These data indicate that higher viral loads and stronger antibody responses are related to more severe disease status in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the antibodies persisted in the recovered patient for more than 6 months so that the vaccine may provide protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Zhang, Xiaoyong; Lu, Suwen; Li, Hui; Wang, Yi; Lu, Zhen; Liu, Zhihong; Lai, Qingtao; Ji, Yali; Huang, Xuan; Li, Yongyin; Sun, Jian; Wu, Yingsong; Xu, Xiaoning; Hou, Jinlin",Virol Sin,,695

Of the 10,738 ED patients, 6% (643) were children. Of these, 156 (24%) sustained ocular trauma. Although the overall number of visits was 44% lower than the same 6-month period in 2019, trauma-related visits were only 34% lower. The mean age was 9.1 ± 5.53 years (range, 4 months to 18 years) and over half (57%) of patients were male.

Since February 2020, doubts were raised about the numbers of confirmed cases and deaths reported by the Chinese government. In this paper, we examine data available from China at the city and provincial levels and we compare them with Canadian provincial data, US state data and French regional data. We consider cumulative and daily numbers of confirmed cases and deaths and examine these numbers through the lens of their first two digits and in particular we measure departures of these first two digits to the Newcomb-Benford distribution, often used to detect frauds. Our finding is that there is no evidence that cumulative and daily numbers of confirmed cases and deaths for all these countries have different first or second digit distributions. We also show that the Newcomb-Benford distribution cannot be rejected for these data.","Coeurjolly, Jean-Franccois",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.05009v1.pdf,695

357850,Smartphone-based GNSS Method for Covid-19 Information on Android (Case Study: Surabaya City),2021,"OBJECTIVE: To determine if rapid implementation of simulation training for the nasopharyngeal swab procedure can increase provider confidence regarding procedure competency. METHODS: A simulation training exercise was designed as a departmental initiative to improve competency performing nasopharyngeal swabs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Sixty-one health care workers attended teaching sessions led by the Department of Otorhinolaryngology on proper nasopharyngeal swab technique. After a brief lecture, participants practiced their swab technique using a high-fidelity airway simulation model. Pre- and postintervention self-evaluations were measured via standardized clinical competency questionnaires on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from ""No knowledge, unable to perform"" up to ""Highly knowledgeable and confident, independent."" RESULTS: Forty-six participants in this study submitted pre- and postintervention self-assessments. Postintervention scores improved on average 1.41 points (95% CI, 1.10-1.73) out of 5 from a mean score of 3.13 to 4.54 (P < .0001). This reflects a large effect size with a Glass's delta value of 1.3. DISCUSSION: Lecture coupled with simulation-based teaching can significantly improve health care workers' confidence in performing nasopharyngeal swabs. Proper training for frontline workers performing swabs for COVID-19 is essential to improving testing accuracy and can be achieved in a simple and timely manner. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: To meet the testing needs of the growing pandemic, many health care workers who are unfamiliar with nasopharyngeal swabs have been asked to perform this test. Simulation-based teaching sessions may improve health care workers' confidence and help prevent false-negative results. This intervention is easily reproducible in any setting where frequent nasopharyngeal swab testing occurs.

Methods: This study included 44 positive COVID-19 patients confirmed with nasopharyngeal swabs during the period 17– 28 February 2021 at Sohag Tropical Medicine Hospital. Tears and conjunctival secretions were examined for the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA. Results: While non-reactive results are strongly correlated to low titre and vice versa, severity showed significant correlation with neither IgA reactivity nor titre. Meanwhile, IgA reactivity did not show significant correlation with either age or sex. The reactivity and IgA titre are correlated with ocular symptoms. Conclusion: The anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA could be found in ocular secretions in SARS-CoV-2 patients. There is no correlation with age or sex or severity of the disease;however, they are correlated with ocular symptoms.","Mahmoud, Hany Hamody Ahmed Hefny Hesham M.; Tohamy, Dalia Islam Awny",Clinical Ophthalmology,,695
362295,A plastic surgery service response to COVID-19 in one of the largest teaching hospitals in Europe,2020,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread out as a pandemic threat affecting over 2 million people. The infectious process initiates via binding of SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) glycoprotein to host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The interaction is mediated by the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S glycoprotein, promoting host receptor recognition and binding to ACE2 peptidase domain (PD), thus representing a promising target for therapeutic intervention. Herein, we present a computational study aimed at identifying small molecules potentially able to target RBD. Although targeting PPI remains a challenge in drug discovery, our investigation highlights that interaction between SARS-CoV-2 RBD and ACE2 PD might be prone to small molecule modulation, due to the hydrophilic nature of the bi-molecular recognition process and the presence of druggable hot spots. The fundamental objective is to identify, and provide to the international scientific community, hit molecules potentially suitable to enter the drug discovery process, preclinical validation and development.","Gulotta, Maria Rita; Lombino, Jessica; Perricone, Ugo; De Simone, Giada; Mekni, Nedra; De Rosa, Maria; Diana, Patrizia; Padova, Alessandro",ChemMedChem,,695

In this context, some questions arise naturally: What can countries caught up in the epidemic learn from China’s experience? In regions where the outbreak is under control, what would lead to a resurgence of the epidemic? To address these issues, we investigate China’s experience in anticontagion interventions and reopening process, focusing on the coevolution of epidemic and awareness during COVID-19 outbreak. Through an empirical analysis based on large-scale data and simulation based on a metapopulation and multilayer network model, we ascertain the impact of human movements and awareness diffusion on the epidemic, elucidate the inherent patterns and effective interventions of different epidemic prevention methods, and highlight the crunch time of each measure. The results are also employed to analyze COVID-19 evolution in other countries so as to find unified rules in complex situations around the world and provide advice on anticontagion and reopening policies. Our findings explain some key mechanisms of epidemic prevention and may help the epidemic analysis and decision-making in various countries suffering from COVID-19.","Li, Lingbo Fan Ying Zeng An Zengru Di",Complexity,,695

Despite being illegal in Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil, the use of abrasive threads remains widespread and poses a health risk to both humans and animals. In this study, we analysed the records of 462 magnificent frigatebirds (Fregata magnificens) submitted to rehabilitation centres or found dead along the southern coast of Rio de Janeiro state from October 2016 to August 2020. Of these, 244 individuals (52.8%) presented wing lesions consistent with kite-string injury, which can have a critical impact on the ability of frigatebirds to fly and will ultimately cause their death. Even when veterinary care is provided, only a small proportion of the individuals (2%) will fully recover the ability to fly in order to be released back to the wild. In 2020, an atypical increase in the number of individuals with kite-string injuries (similar to 1,200% increase compared to other years) was noted in the weeks following the suspension of school activities and commerce in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The number of frigatebirds with kite-string injuries recorded in a given week was positively correlated with internet searches for kite-related terms, which also peaked during the quarantine period of the COVID-19 pandemic. This illustrates how pandemic events may aggravate existing human-wildlife conflicts, and how preparedness plans need to incorporate measures to help communities cope with boredom and isolation during quarantine in ways that do not negatively impact the welfare and conservation of wildlife.","Goldberg, D.

390045,Challenge of integrated low-cost emission monitoring system into a digital information system,2021,"BACKGROUND: Previous studies described the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in outdoor air particulate matter (PM) in urban areas of northern Italy and USA. The city of Madrid was heavily affected by COVID-19 during March-June 2020. Also, this city usually displays high concentrations of PM under several atmospheric situations. This is mandatory to assess the presence of viral RNA in PM, as an indicator of epidemic recurrence. Our study was aimed at investigating the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in outdoor air samples (on PM10, PM2.5 and PM1). METHODS: Six samples of PM10, PM2.5 and PM1 were collected between the May 4th and 22nd 2020 in Madrid, on quartz fiber filters by using MCV high volume samplers (30 m3 h-1 flow) with three inlets (Digitel DHA-80) for sampling PM10, PM2.5 and PM1. RNA extraction and amplification was performed according to the protocol recently set by Setti et al.2020c in Italy. Up to three highly specific molecular marker genes (N1, N2, and RP) were used to test the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. RESULTS: After RNA extraction and expression measurements of N1, N2 and RP genes from all the collected filters, no presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was observed. Control tests to exclude false positive results were successfully accomplished. CONCLUSIONS: No presence of SARS-CoV-2 in quartz fiber filters samplers for PM10, PM2.5 and PM1 fractions was observed in our study carried out in Madrid during the month of May 2020. Nevertheless, the absence of viral genomes could be due to different factors including: limited social interactions and economic activities resulting in reduced circulation of the coronavirus, lower daily PM concentration in outdoor air, as well as to meteorological stability and higher temperature that characterize spring season. Further research should be carried out during winter, in presence of higher viral circulation and daily PM exceedances.","Linillos-Pradillo, Beatriz; Rancan, Lisa; Ramiro, Elías Díaz; Vara, Elena; Artíñano, Begoña; Arias, Javier",Environ Res,,695

The A.23 viral lineage, characterized by three spike mutations F157L, V367F and Q613H, was first identified in COVID-19 cases from a Ugandan prison in July 2020, and then was identified in the general population with additional spike mutations (R102I, L141F, E484K and P681R) to comprise lineage A.23.1 by September 2020--with this virus being designated a variant of interest (VOI) in Africa and with subsequent spread to 26 other countries. The P681R spike substitution of the A.23.1 VOI is of note as it increases the number of basic residues in the sub-optimal SARS-CoV-2 spike protein furin cleavage site; as such, this substitution may affect viral replication, transmissibility or pathogenic properties. The same P681R substitution has also appeared in B.1.617 variants, including B.1.617.2 (Delta). Here, we performed assays using fluorogenic peptides mimicking the S1/S2 sequence from A.23.1 and B.1.617.2 and observed significantly increased cleavability with furin, compared to sequences derived from the original Wuhan-Hu1 S1/S2. We performed functional infectivity assays using pseudotyped MLV particles harboring SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins and observed an increase in transduction for A.23.1-pseudotyped particles compared to Wuhan-Hu-1 in Vero-TMPRSS2 and Calu-3 cells (with a presumed ""early"" entry pathway), although lowered infection in Vero E6 cells (with a presumed ""late"" entry pathway). However, these changes in infectivity were not reproduced in the original Wuhan-Hu-1 spike bearing only the P681R substitution.

Various estimates indicate that high proportions of college students have experienced increased amounts of stress (Dziech, Inside Higher Education, 2020; Hartocollis, New York Times, 2020), yet other sources indicate that many college students respond to these changes with resilience (Kelley, Cornell Chronicle, 2020). A method for assessing student anxiety regarding the pandemic is thus needed. The Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) (Ahorsu et al., International Journal of Mental Health and Addiction, 2020) is a seven-item scale which has been validated and shown to possess good psychometric qualities in studies of participants from multiple countries. The current study used a cross-sectional convenience sample of US college student participants (n = 237) and found that the FCV-19S has high reliability and validity as demonstrated by its internal consistency and strong one-factor solution. Scores on the FCV-19S were positively correlated with anxiety for students who were married or of Asian descent. Additionally, the FCV-19S was only moderately correlated with the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 Scale (GAD-7), suggesting that the FCV-19S may bring added utility to research and clinical practice with populations impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.","Perz, Catherine A; Lang, Brent A; Harrington, Rick",Int J Ment Health Addict,,695

422465,Hand injuries during COVID-19: Lessons from lockdown,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic provides new motivation for a classic problem in epidemiology: estimating the empirical rate of transmission during an outbreak (formally, the time-varying reproduction number) from case counts. While standard methods exist, they work best at coarse-grained national or state scales with abundant data, and struggle to accommodate the partial observability and sparse data common at finer scales (e.g., individual schools or towns). For example, case counts may be sparse when only a small fraction of infections are caught by a testing program. Or, whether an infected individual tests positive may depend on the kind of test and the point in time when they are tested. We propose a Bayesian framework which accommodates partial observability in a principled manner. Our model places a Gaussian process prior over the unknown reproduction number at each time step and models observations sampled from the distribution of a specific testing program. For example, our framework can accommodate a variety of kinds of tests (viral RNA, antibody, antigen, etc.) and sampling schemes (e.g., longitudinal or cross-sectional screening). Inference in this framework is complicated by the presence of tens or hundreds of thousands of discrete latent variables. To address this challenge, we propose an efficient stochastic variational inference method which relies on a novel gradient estimator for the variational objective. Experimental results for an example motivated by COVID-19 show that our method produces an accurate and well-calibrated posterior, while standard methods for estimating the reproduction number can fail badly.","Wilder, Bryan; Mina, Michael J.; Tambe, Milind",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.05863v1.pdf,695

They lack explicit dynamics and have multiple sources of cost, both of which are beyond the current scope of traditional control theory. We construct the global economy risk network by combining the consensus of experts from the World Economic Forum with risk activation data to define its topology and interactions. Many of these risks, including extreme weather and drastic inflation, pose significant economic costs when active. We introduce a method for converting network interaction data into continuous dynamics to which we apply optimal control. We contribute the first method for constructing and controlling risk network dynamics based on empirically collected data. We simulate applying this method to control the spread of COVID-19 and show that the choice of risks through which the network is controlled has significant influence on both the cost of control and the total cost of keeping network stable. We additionally describe a heuristic for choosing the risks trough which the network is controlled, given a general risk network.","Brissette, Christopher; Niu, Xiang; Jiang, Chunheng; Gao, Jianxi; Korniss, Gyorgy; Szymanski, Boleslaw K",Sci Rep,,695
453333,Trauma transformed: A positive review of change during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"People in many countries are now infected with COVID-19. By now, it is clear that the number of people infected is much greater than the number of reported cases. To estimate the infected but undetected/unreported cases using a mathematical model, we can use a parameter called the probability of quarantining an infected individual. This parameter exists in the time-delayed SEIQR model (Scientific Reports, article number: 3505). Here, two limiting cases of a network of such models are used to estimate the undetected population. The first limit corresponds to the network collapsing onto a single node and is referred to as the mean-[Formula: see text] model. In the second case, the number of nodes in the network is infinite and results in a continuum model wherein the infectivity is statistically distributed. We use a generalized Pareto distribution to model the infectivity. This distribution has a fat tail and models the presence of super-spreaders that contribute to the disease progression. While both models capture the detected numbers well, the predictions of affected numbers from the continuum model are more realistic. Our results suggest that affected people outnumber detected people by one to two orders of magnitude in Spain, the UK, Italy, and Germany. Our results are consistent with corresponding trends obtained from published serological studies in Spain, the UK and Italy. The match with limited studies in Germany is poor, possibly because Germany's partial lockdown approach requires different modeling.","Tiwari, Sankalp; Vyasarayani, C P; Chatterjee, Anindya",Sci Rep,,695

Yoga and meditation are proven interventions to reduce stress and anxiety and increase wellness. Yin yoga is an adaptable, quiet practice ideal for those lacking previous yoga experience, flexibility, and time. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of a 6-week yin yoga and meditation intervention on College of Pharmacy faculty and students' stress perception, anxiety levels, and mindfulness skills. METHODS: Faculty and students participated in a 6-week pilot program comprising a once-weekly yin yoga class followed by guided meditation. Yin yoga was selected for its quiet meditative style. Participants completed a pre- and postquestionnaire at 6 weeks and 3 and 6 months to evaluate potential changes in perceived stress scores, anxiety scores, and mindfulness skills. The questionnaire was composed of 3 self-reporting tools: Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Perceived Stress Scale, and the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire. RESULTS: Twenty participants, 12 students and 8 faculty (ages 18-66 years), completed the study. Anxiety and stress scores decreased, and mindfulness increased at 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months, with all changes reaching statistical significance. No participants reported being in the ""high"" category of anxiety after intervention using BAI categorical data, although this finding was not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Faculty and students demonstrated a reduction in stress and anxiety levels and an increase in mindfulness after a 6-week yin yoga and meditation program. Outcomes suggest that inclusion of an adaptable, meditative practice, which may easily be replicated at home, for as little as once per week for 6 weeks may reduce stress and anxiety and increase mindfulness long term. Creating a culture of wellness should be a priority for all Colleges of Pharmacy.","Lemay, Virginia; Hoolahan, John; Buchanan, Ashley",,,695
475439,A Moroccan plastic surgery department approach during COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review summarizes infectious diseases involving the small bowel (SB) with a focus on recent literature related to diagnosis and pathophysiology. RECENT FINDINGS: Typical symptom for SB infections is diarrhea, mostly self-limiting. Pathogens include bacteria, viruses, fungi, protozoan parasites, and helminths. Host-pathogen interaction is of special interest in infections with potentially severe or prolonged course. Research uses increasingly enterocyte cell culture systems. SARS-CoV2 can also infect enterocytes via angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and causes gastrointestinal complaints in some patients. Chronic SB infections as tuberculosis, Cytomegalovirus, or Epstein-Barr virus have to be differentiated from Crohn's and other diseases. Severe rare fungal and protozoan parasitic infections can cause relevant morbidity in immunocompromised patients. Soil-transmitted helminthic infections are a special issue in endemic areas. SUMMARY: Many infections involve the SB, typically causing mild and self-limiting diarrhea. Symptomatic therapy, hygiene, and isolation are the mainstay of management. However, some patients develop severe or chronic disease. Immunosuppression is a major cause for severe, but also for rare opportunistic systemic infections that can also affect the SB.","Keuchel, Martin; Bota, Marc; Baltes, Peter",Curr Opin Gastroenterol,,695

Guidance, information and best practices have been characterized by territorial thinking with concentration on national health system and social contexts. Information was to a large extent provided from global entities such as the World Health Organization (WHO), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and others. This bipolar response mechanism came to the detriment of regional and sub-regional levels. The development of the global pandemic was evaluated in terms of the performance of single countries without trying to reflect on possible regional or sub-regional results of similar characteristics in health system and social contexts. To have a clearer view of the issue of sub-regional similarities, we examined the WHO, Eastern Mediterranean Region. When examining the development of confirmed cases for countries in the region, we identified four different sub-groups similar in the development of the pandemic and the social distancing measure implemented. Despite the complicated situation, these groups gave space for thinking outside the box of traditional outbreaks or pandemic response. We think that this sub-regional approach could be very effective in addressing more characteristics and not geographically based analysis. Furthermore, this can be an area of additional conceptual approaches, modelling and concrete platforms for information and lessons learned exchange.","Ali Maher, Osama; Elamein Boshara, Mohamed Abdalla; Pichierri, Giuseppe; Cegolon, Luca; Panu Napodano, Catello Mario; Murgia, Paola; Bellizzi, Saverio",J Infect Dev Ctries,,695

Neuroinfections caused by these agents activate immune responses, inducing neuroinflammation, excitotoxicity, and neurodegeneration. Purinergic signaling is an evolutionarily conserved signaling pathway associated with these neuropathologies. During neuroinfections, host cells release ATP as an extracellular danger signal with pro-inflammatory activities. ATP is metabolized to its derivatives by ectonucleotidases such as CD39 and CD73; ATP and its metabolites modulate neuronal and immune mechanisms through P1 and P2 purinergic receptors that are involved in pathophysiological mechanisms of neuroinfections. In this review we discuss the beneficial or deleterious effects of various components of the purinergic signaling pathway in infectious diseases that affect the CNS, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection, herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infection, bacterial meningitis, sepsis, cryptococcosis, toxoplasmosis, and malaria. We also provide a description of this signaling pathway in emerging viral infections with neurological implications such as Zika and SARS-CoV-2.","Alves, Vinícius Santos; Leite-Aguiar, Raíssa; Silva, Joyce Pereira da; Coutinho-Silva, Robson; Savio, Luiz Eduardo Baggio",Brain Behav Immun,,695

The acute illness phase generally lasts no more than 2–3 weeks. However, there is increasing evidence that a proportion of COVID-19 patients experience a prolonged convalescence and continue to have symptoms lasting several months after the initial infection. A variety of chronic symptoms have been reported including fatigue, dyspnea, myalgia, exercise intolerance, sleep disturbances, difficulty concentrating, anxiety, fever, headache, malaise, and vertigo. These symptoms are similar to those seen in myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), a chronic multi-system illness characterized by profound fatigue, sleep disturbances, neurocognitive changes, orthostatic intolerance, and post-exertional malaise. ME/CFS symptoms are exacerbated by exercise or stress and occur in the absence of any significant clinical or laboratory findings. The pathology of ME/CFS is not known: it is thought to be multifactorial, resulting from the dysregulation of multiple systems in response to a particular trigger. Although not exclusively considered a post-infectious entity, ME/CFS has been associated with several infectious agents including Epstein–Barr Virus, Q fever, influenza, and other coronaviruses. There are important similarities between post-acute COVID-19 symptoms and ME/CFS. However, there is currently insufficient evidence to establish COVID-19 as an infectious trigger for ME/CFS. Further research is required to determine the natural history of this condition, as well as to define risk factors, prevalence, and possible interventional strategies. © The Author(s), 2021.","Poenaru, S.; Abdallah, S.

497126,Evolution of plastic surgery provision due to COVID-19 - The role of the 'Pandemic pack',2020,"During an epidemic, infectious individuals might not be detectable until some time after becoming infected. The studies show that carriers with mild or no symptoms are the main contributors to the transmission of a virus within the population. The average time it takes to develop the symptoms causes a delay in the spread dynamics of the disease. When considering the influence of delay on the disease propagation in epidemic networks, depending on the value of the time-delay and the network topology, the peak of epidemic could be considerably different in time, duration, and intensity. Motivated by the recent worldwide outbreak of the COVID-19 virus and the topological extent in which this virus has spread over the course of a few months, this study aims to highlight the effect of time-delay in the progress of such infectious diseases in the meta-population networks rather than individuals or a single population. In this regard, the notions of epidemic network centrality in terms of the underlying interaction graph of the network, structure of the uncertainties, and symptom development duration are investigated to establish a centrality-based analysis of the disease evolution. A traffic volume convex optimization method is then developed to control the outbreak by identifying the sub-populations with the highest centrality and then isolating them while maintaining the same overall traffic volume (motivated by economic considerations) in the meta-population level. The numerical results, along with the theoretical expectations, highlight the impact of time-delay as well as the importance of considering the worst-case scenarios in investigating the most effective methods of epidemic containment.","Darabi, Atefe; Siami, Milad",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.00398v1.pdf,695

Reverse vaccinology (RV) is a state-of-the-art technique to predict vaccine candidates from pathogen's genome(s). To promote vaccine development, we updated Vaxign2, the first web-based vaccine design program using reverse vaccinology with machine learning. Vaxign2 is a comprehensive web server for rational vaccine design, consisting of predictive and computational workflow components. The predictive part includes the original Vaxign filtering-based method and a new machine learning-based method, Vaxign-ML. The benchmarking results using a validation dataset showed that Vaxign-ML had superior prediction performance compared to other RV tools. Besides the prediction component, Vaxign2 implemented various post-prediction analyses to significantly enhance users' capability to refine the prediction results based on different vaccine design rationales and considerably reduce user time to analyze the Vaxign/Vaxign-ML prediction results. Users provide proteome sequences as input data, select candidates based on Vaxign outputs and Vaxign-ML scores, and perform post-prediction analysis. Vaxign2 also includes precomputed results from approximately 1 million proteins in 398 proteomes of 36 pathogens. As a demonstration, Vaxign2 was used to effectively analyse SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus causing COVID-19. The comprehensive framework of Vaxign2 can support better and more rational vaccine design.

Elevated troponin may signify myocardial damage and is predictive of mortality. This study aimed to assess the prognostic value of troponin above the 99th percentile upper reference limit (URL) for mortality, and factors affecting the relationship. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search of PubMed (MEDLINE), Scopus and Embase was undertaken, from inception of the databases until 16 December 2020. The key exposure was elevated serum troponin, defined as troponin (of any type) above the 99th percentile URL. The outcome was mortality due to any cause. RESULTS: In total, 12,262 patients from 13 studies were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. The mortality rate was 23% (20-26%). Elevated troponin was observed in 31% (23-38%) of patients. Elevated troponin was associated with increased mortality [odds ratio (OR) 4.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) 4.07-5.53; P < 0.001; I2 = 19.9%]. Meta-regression showed that the association did not vary with age (P = 0.218), male gender (P = 0.707), hypertension (P = 0.182), diabetes (P = 0.906) or coronary artery disease (P = 0864). The association between elevated troponin and mortality had sensitivity of 0.55 (0.44-0.66), specificity of 0.80 (0.71-0.86), positive likelihood ratio of 2.7 (2.2-3.3), negative likelihood ratio of 0.56 (0.49-0.65), diagnosis odds ratio of 5 (4-5) and area under the curve of 0.73 (0.69-0.77). The probability of mortality was 45% in patients with elevated troponin and 14% in patients with non-elevated troponin. CONCLUSION: Elevated troponin was associated with mortality in patients with COVID-19 with 55% sensitivity and 80% specificity.","Wibowo, Arief; Pranata, Raymond; Akbar, Mohammad Rizki; Purnomowati, Augustine; Martha, Januar Wibawa",Int J Infect Dis,,695

This article will review the diversity, health benefits, interaction with immune system and antiviral activity of fermented foods and their probiotics bacteria. In addition, the mechanisms of action will be reviewed to determine the broad range potential antiviral activity against the respiratory and alimentary tracts viruses. The probiotics bacteria and bioactive compounds in fermented foods demonstrated antiviral activities against respiratory and alimentary tracts viruses. The mechanism of action was reported to be due to the stimulation of the immune system function via enhancing natural killers cell toxicity, enhance the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and increasing the cytotoxic of T lymphocytes (CD3(+), CD16(+), CD56(+)).

Government-imposed restrictions to contain the spread of the virus has forced people to suddenly adjust their lifestyle. This study aimed to capture the impact of the pandemic on people living with diabetes and the views of these individuals on ways in which the information, advice and support they are receiving could be improved. Research design and methods An online anonymous survey was distributed across the UK during the first lockdown and initial easing. The survey comprised questions about confidence in diabetes self-management, resources used to obtain information, advice and support, and opinions on how these could be improved. Open-ended captured subjective experiences. Results The survey was completed by 773 adults living with diabetes (69.2% type 1, 28.5% type 2). There was notable variability in the impact of the pandemic on confidence in self-management, with confidence having deteriorated most commonly in the ability to take care of own mental wellbeing (37.0% respondents) and improved most commonly in maintaining a healthy weight (21.1% respondents). 41.2% of respondents living alone reported not receiving any outside support. The quality of information, advice and support received from the healthcare team was rated poorly by 37.2%. Respondents sought greater communication and tailored advice from their care team, clear and consistent information from the government and news channels, and improved understanding of diabetes and its challenges from their personal networks and employers. Conclusion Adjusting to the COVID-19 pandemic has strained the mental health and wellbeing of people living with diabetes. Diabetes care teams must receive assistance to support these individuals without risking further inequalities in access to healthcare. Equipping personal networks and employers with knowledge on diabetes and skills to support self-management may reduce the burden on the NHS.","Sauchelli, S.; Bradley, J.; England, C.; Searle, A.; Whitmarsh, A.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.20.21249888; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.20.21249888v1?rss=1,695

597974,Patterns of Adult and Paediatric Hand Trauma During the COVID-19 Lockdown,2020-05-29,"TBX2 and TBX3 are members of the T-box family of transcription factors, which are implicated in embryonic development. Unlike most members of the T-box family, TBX2 and TBX3 are the only mammalian T-box factors which function as transcriptional repressors, mediated by the repression domain in the C-terminal. In addition to a role in development, recent evidence suggests that TBX2 and TBX3 are overexpressed in a number of cancers, including melanoma, breast, liver, lung, pancreas, ovarian, and cervical cancers. However, there is little information about the mechanisms for how these T-box genes contribute to tumorigenesis. Upregulation of TBX2 and TBX3 suppresses the expression of p14(ARF) and p21(CIP1) and promotes bypass of senescence through inactivation of p53 pathway. TBX2 functionally interacts with pRb, and pRb modulates TBX2 functional specificity. In addition, TBX2 is a player of Wnt signaling while TBX3 is a downstream target of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway, and overexpression of TBX2 and TBX3 represses the expression of E-cadherin, which is demonstrated to be a prerequisite for epithelial tumor cell invasion. Moreover, TBX2 is shown to interact with EGR1 to block multiple downstream tumor suppressors. Here, we review the current knowledge on TBX2 and TBX3 in tumorigenesis and prospect their special value for development of target-based anticancer drugs.","Lu, Juan; Li, Xiang-Ping; Dong, Qi; Kung, Hsiang-fu; He, Ming-Liang",Biochim Biophys Acta Rev Cancer,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304419X1000051X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbcan.2010.07.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20624445/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0304419X1000051X,695
598571,COVID-19 lockdown and beyond: home practice solutions for develop-ing microsurgical skills.,2020-08-20,"We consider the concerted evolution of viral genomes in four families of DNA viruses. Given the high rate of horizontal gene transfer among viruses and their hosts, it is an open question as to how representative particular genes are of the evolutionary history of the complete genome. To address the concerted evolution of viral genes, we compared genomic evolution across four distinct, extant viral families. For all four viral families we constructed DNA-dependent DNA polymerase-based (DdDp) phylogenies and in addition, whole genome sequence, as quantitative descriptions of inter-genome relationships. We found that the history of the polymerase gene was highly predictive of the history of the genome as a whole, which we explain in terms of repeated, co-divergence events of the core DdDp gene accompanied by a number of satellite, accessory genetic loci. We also found that the rate of gene gain in baculovirus and poxviruses proceeds significantly more quickly than the rate of gene loss and that there is convergent acquisition of satellite functions promoting contextual adaptation when distinct viral families infect related hosts. The congruence of the genome and polymerase trees suggests that a large set of viral genes, including polymerase, derive from a phylogenetically conserved core of genes of host origin, secondarily reinforced by gene acquisition from common hosts or co-infecting viruses within the host. A single viral genome can be thought of as a mutualistic network, with the core genes acting as an effective host and the satellite genes as effective symbionts. Larger virus genomes show a greater departure from linkage equilibrium between core and satellites functions.","Zanotto, Paolo Marinho de Andrade; Krakauer, David C.",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0003500; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18941535/,695

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on colorectal cancer disease stage. DESIGN AND SETTING: Retrospective analysis in the city of Rize, Turkey. METHODS: This was a comparative analysis on two groups of patients with various symptoms who underwent surgical colorectal cancer treatment. Group 1 comprised patients operated between March 11, 2019, and December 31, 2019;while group 2 comprised patients at the same time of the year during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Groups 1 and 2 included 56 and 48 patients, respectively. The rate of presentation to the emergency service was higher in Group 2 (P < 0.02). The stage of the pathological lymph nodes and the rate of liver metastasis was higher in Group 2 (P < 0.004 and P < 0.041, respectively). The disease stage was found to be more advanced in Group 2 (P < 0.005). The rate of postoperative complications was higher in Group 2 (P < 0.014). CONCLUSION: The presentation of patients with suspicious findings to the hospital was delayed, due both to the fear of catching COVID-19 and to the pandemic precautions that were proposed and implemented by healthcare authorities worldwide. Among the patients who presented to the hospital with emergency complaints and in whom colorectal cancer was detected, their disease was at a more advanced stage and thus a higher number of emergency oncological surgical procedures were performed on those patients.","Uyan, M.; Ozdemir, A.; Kalcan, S.; Tomas, K.; Demiral, G.; Pergel, A.; Tarim, I.

CoV genomes regularly undergo recombination during infection as observed in bat SARS-related CoVs. Here we report for the first time that only a small proportion of MERS-CoV receptor-binding domain positive (RBD) of spike protein positive camel sera in Kenya were also seropositive to MERS-CoV nucleocapsid (NP). In contrast, many of them contain antibodies against bat HKU8-related (HKU8r)-CoVs. Among 584 camel samples that were positive against MERS-CoV RBD, we found only 0.48 (8.22%) samples were also positive for NP. Furthermore, we found bat HKU8r-CoV NP antibody in 73 (12.5%) of the MERS-CoV RBD positive and NP negative samples, yet found only 3 (0.43%) of the HKU8r-CoV S1 antibody in the same samples. These findings may indicate co-infection with MERS-CoV and a HKU8r-CoV in camels. It may also raise the possibility of the circulation of a recombinant coronavirus virus with the spike of MERS-CoV and the NP of a HKU8r-CoV in Kenya. We failed to find molecular evidence of an HKU8r-CoV or a putative recombinant virus. Our findings should alert other investigators to look for molecular evidence of HKU8r-CoV or recombinants.","Zhang, Wei; Zheng, Xiao-Shuang; Agwanda, Bernard; Ommeh, Sheila; Zhao, Kai; Lichoti, Jacqueline; Wang, Ning; Chen, Jing; Li, Bei; Yang, Xing-Lou; Mani, Shailendra; Ngeiywa, Kisa-Juma; Zhu, Yan; Hu, Ben; Onyuok, Samson Omondi; Yan, Bing; Anderson, Danielle E.; Wang, Lin-Fa; Zhou, Peng; Shi, Zheng-Li",Emerg Microbes Infect,https://doi.org/10.1080/22221751.2019.1679610; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31645223/,695

The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the presence of antibodies against heparin/PF4 in adults who received a first dose of the ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccine, and correlate them with clinical data and antibody responses to the vaccine. We detected non-platelet activating anti-PF4 antibodies in 67% (29/43) of the vaccinated individuals on day 22 following the first dose of the ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccine, though these were detected in low titers. Furthermore, there was no correlation between the presence of anti-PF4 IgG antibodies and the baseline clinical characteristics of the patients. Our findings suggest that the ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccine can elicit anti-PF4 antibody production even in recipients without a clinical manifestation of thrombosis. The presence of anti-PF4 antibodies was not sufficient to provoke clinically evident thrombosis. Our results offer an important insight into the ongoing investigations regarding the underlying multifactorial pathophysiology of thrombotic events induced by the ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccine.","Terpos, Evangelos; Politou, Marianna; Ntanasis-Stathopoulos, Ioannis; Karalis, Vangelis; Merkouri, Efrosyni; Fotiou, Despina; Gavriatopoulou, Maria; Malandrakis, Panagiotis; Kastritis, Efstathios; Trougakos, Ioannis P.; Dimopoulos, Meletios A.",Vaccines (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34358129/; https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9070712,695

Even though it began to spread to many other parts of the world, such as other Asian countries, the Americas, Europe, and the Middle East, the impact of secondary outbreaks caused by exported cases outside China remains unclear. We conducted simulations to estimate the impact of potential secondary outbreaks in a community outside China. Simulations using stochastic SEIR model were conducted, assuming one patient was imported to a community. Among 45 possible scenarios we prepared, the worst scenario resulted in the total number of persons recovered or removed to be 997 (95% CrI 990–1000) at day 100 and a maximum number of symptomatic infectious patients per day of 335 (95% CrI 232–478). Calculated mean basic reproductive number (R(0)) was 6.5 (Interquartile range, IQR 5.6–7.2). However, better case scenarios with different parameters led to no secondary cases.

A virus is a “submicroscopic and intracellular parasite” that can propagate only inside a living cell. The obligatory nature of a virus brought a debate on whether it is living or nonliving. Virology, as a discipline that studies the diverse aspects of viral infection of host cells and its consequence, became established during the early 20th century. Viruses are found in almost all living organisms on earth, ranging from bacteria, fungi, and amoeba, to plants and animals. Viruses are classified into seven groups, according to genomic features.

However, limited studies have explored the influence of these strategies from the perspective of COVID-19 patients. This study aims to describe the impact of governmental COVID-19 policy and prevention strategies on COVID-19 patients in China. METHODS: Twenty-six people who had been treated for COVID-19 in a COVID-19-designated facility in Shanghai, China, were recruited using the purposive sampling method. These individuals participated in semi-structured interviews by phone from April to June 2020. A thematic content analysis approach was conducted. The consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative studies checklist was applied. RESULTS: Three categories of themes emerged from the thematic analysis. The first was “Consciously adhere to COVID-19-related infection-control strategies.” Most of these patients followed the COVID-19 strategies throughout the stages of their illness. The second category was “Positive experiences of the COVID-19-related infection-control strategies.” These patients shared their positive experiences of the governmental infection-control strategies to contain the virus; for example, they experienced a quick and adequate medical response, they were con dent in the medical system, or they received help from community workers. The third category was “Negative experiences of the COVID-19-related infection-control strategies.” These patients experienced psychological distress, stigma, privacy exposures, and inconveniences from the governmental strategies. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings exemplify how patients with COVID-19 adhered to the infection-control strategies in China. It is urgent to develop a culturally sensitive intervention to eliminate the psychological distress and stigma of patients with COVID-19 and to protect their privacy during and after the pandemic.","huang, fei fei; Chen, wei-ti; sun, wen xiu; zhang, lin; lu, hongzhou",Res Sq,https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-710681/v1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34282413/,695
641354,Prone position pressure sores in the COVID-19 pandemic: The Madrid experience,2020-12-26,"BACKGROUND: Since the outbreak of the SARS‐CoV‐2 pandemic several reports indicated neurological involvement in COVID‐19 disease. Muscle involvement has also been reported as evidenced by creatine kinase (CK) elevations and reports of myalgia. METHODS: CK, markers of inflammation, pre‐existing diseases and statin use were extracted from records of Austrian hospitalized COVID‐19 patients. Disease severity was classified as severe in case of intensive care unit (ICU) admission or mortality. COVID‐19 patients were additionally compared to a historical group of hospitalized influenza patients. RESULTS: 351 patients with SARS‐CoV‐2 and 258 with influenza were included in the final analysis. CK was elevated in 27% of COVID‐19 and in 28% of influenza patients. CK was higher in severe COVID‐19 as were markers of inflammation. CK correlated significantly with inflammation markers, which had an independent impact on CK when adjusted for demographic variables and disease severity. Compared to influenza patients, COVID‐19 patients were older, more frequent male, had more comorbidities and more frequently a severe disease course. Nevertheless, influenza patients had higher baseline CK than COVID‐19, and 35.7% of ICU admitted patients had CK levels > 1000 U/l compared to only 4.7% of ICU‐admitted COVID‐19 patients. CONCLUSIONS: HyperCKemia occurs in a similar frequency in COVID‐19 and influenza infection. CK levels were lower in COVID‐19 than in influenza in mild and severe disease. CK levels strongly correlate with disease severity and markers of inflammation. To date it remains unclear whether hyperCKemia is due to a virus‐triggered inflammatory response or direct muscle toxicity.","Pitscheider, Lea; Karolyi, Mario; Burkert, Francesco R.; Helbok, Raimund; Wanschitz, Julia V.; Horlings, Corinne; Pawelka, Erich; Omid, Sara; Traugott, Marianna; Seitz, Tamara; Zoufaly, Alexander; Lindeck‐Pozza, Elisabeth; Wöll, Ewald; Beer, Ronny; Seiwald, Stefanie; Bellmann‐Weiler, Rosa; Hegen, Harald; Löscher, Wolfgang N.",Eur J Neurol,https://doi.org/10.1111/ene.14564; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32997370/,695

650620,The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Cleft Care,2021-04-28,"BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) highly impacts patients on several life dimensions and challenges healthcare practices in providing high-quality care. Consequently, it is crucial to establish integrated care processes, maximizing patient value and patients’ individual needs. The aim of the study was to shed light on the care trajectory based on the perspectives of patients and healthcare professionals. METHODS: The study was conducted at a tertiary Belgian IPF centre of excellence. We conducted individual interviews with patients and healthcare professionals, guided by the Chronic Care Model (CCM) as a framework for integrated care. Thematic analysis was used to underpin data analysis. RESULTS: Experiences were gathered of nine patients with IPF (aged 57–83 years, of which the informal caregivers were present at five interviews) and nine professionals involved in the IPF care trajectory. Our findings identified pitfalls and suggestions for improvement covering all elements of the CCM, primarily at the level of the individual patient and the care team. We covered suggestions to improve the team-based care and pro-active follow-up of patients’ needs. Self-management support was highlighted as an important area and we identified possibilities, but also challenges regarding the use of patient-reported outcomes and eHealth-tools. Furthermore, the importance of continuous training for professionals and the implementation of guidelines in routine care was pointed out. Also, participants mentioned an opportunity to collaborate with community-based organizations and raised challenges regarding the overall health system. Lastly, the pertaining lack of IPF awareness and the disease burden on patients and their caregivers were covered. CONCLUSIONS: Our research team has initiated a project aiming to optimize the current care delivery practice for IPF patients at a Belgian centre of excellence.

658115,Pressure Injury: A Non-negligible Comorbidity for Critical Covid-19 Patients,2020-08-13,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has turned the care model of health systems around the world upside down, abruptly cancelling face-to-face visits to avoid contagion and redirecting the model towards telemedicine. Digital transformation boosts information systems, which, the more robust they are, the easier it is to monitor the healthcare system in a highly complex state and allow for more agile and reliable analysis. OBJECTIVE: To analyse diagnoses from primary care visits and distinguish between those that had higher and lower variations, relative to the 2019 and 2020 periods (roughly pre- and during COVID), to identify clinical profiles that may have been most impaired and diagnoses least visited during the pandemic. METHODS: A database from the Primary Care Services Information Technologies Information System of Catalonia is used. The object of the analysis is the register of visits (2,824,185) and their diagnostic codes (3921974, mean 01.38 per visit) as approximators of the reason for consultation, registered according to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) at three different grouping levels. The data is represented by a term frequency matrix and analysed recursively in different partitions aggregated according to date. RESULTS: In number of visits, the increase in non-face-to-face (+267%) does not compensate for the decrease in face-to-face visits (-47%), with an overall reduction in the total number of visits (-1.36%) despite the notable increase in nursing visits (10.54%). The visits with the largest increase in 2020 are those with diagnoses related to COVID-19 (codes Z20-Z29, 2.540%), along with codes related to economic and housing problems (Z55-Z65, 44.40%). Most of the rest of the codes visited decrease in 2020 relative to 2019. Those that have presented the most important reductions have been some chronic pathologies such as arterial hypertension (I10-I16; -32.73%) or diabetes mellitus (E08-E13; -21.13%), but also obesity (E65-E68; -48.58%) and bodily injuries (T14; -33.70%). Visits with mental health related diagnosis codes have decreased, but less than average. Both for children and adolescents and for adults, there was a decrease in consultations for respiratory infections (J00-J06; -40.96%). The results show very significant year-on-year variations (in absolute terms, an average of 12%), a sign of the strong shock to the health system. CONCLUSIONS: The disruption in the primary care model in Catalonia has led to an explosion in the number of non-face-to-face visits. There has been a reduction in the number of visits for diagnoses related to chronic pathologies, respiratory infections, obesity and bodily injuries. Instead, visits for diagnoses related to socio-economic and housing problems have increased, which emphasizes the importance of Social Determinants of Health in this pandemic context. Big data-based approaches built with routine care data, as the one presented in this analysis, are consistent with intuitions from everyday clinical practice and can help inform decision making by health planners in order to use the next few years to focus on the least treated diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Lopez Segui, Francesc; Hernandez Guillamet, Guillem; Pifarré Arolas, Héctor; Marin Gomez, Xavier; Ruiz Comellas, Anna; Ramirez Morros, Anna Maria; Adroher Mas, Cristina; Vidal-Alaball, Josep",J. med. internet res,https://doi.org/10.2196/29622; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34313600/,695

This study analyzes the effects of COVID-19 based on likely positive cases and fatality in India during and after the lockdown period from March 24, 2020, to May 24, 2020. METHODS: Python has been used as the main programming language for data analysis and forecasting using the Prophet model, a time series analysis model. The data set has been preprocessed by grouping together the days for total numbers of cases and deaths on few selected dates and removing missing values present in some states. RESULTS: The Prophet model performs better in terms of precision on the real data. Prediction depicts that, during the lockdown, the total cases were rising but in a controlled manner with an accuracy of 87%. After the relaxation of lockdown rules, the predictions have shown an obstreperous situation with an accuracy of 60%. CONCLUSION: The resilience could have been better if the lockdown with strict norms was continued without much relaxation.

Analyzing the impact of COVID-19 on private practice,2021-03-10,"OBJECTIVE: To describe coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) and pregnancy outcomes in patients with rheumatic disease who were pregnant at the time of infection. METHODS: Since March 2020 the COVID-19 Global Rheumatology Alliance (GRA) has collected cases of patients with rheumatic disease with COVID-19. We report details of pregnant women at the time of COVID-19 infection, including obstetric details separately ascertained from providers. RESULTS: We report on 39 patients, including 22 with obstetric detail available. The mean and median age was 33 years, range 24-45 years. Rheumatic disease diagnoses included: rheumatoid arthritis (n=9), systemic lupus erythematosus (n=9), psoriatic/other inflammatory arthritides (n=8) and anti-phospholipid antibody syndrome (n=6). Most had a term birth (16/22), with 3 pre-term births, one termination, one miscarriage and one woman yet to deliver at time of report. A quarter (n=10/39) of pregnant women were hospitalised following COVID-19 diagnosis. Two of 39 (5%) required supplemental oxygen (both hospitalised); no patient died. The majority did not receive specific medication treatment for their COVID-19 (n=32/39, 82%), seven patients received some combination of anti-malarials, colchicine, anti-IL-1beta, azithromycin, glucocorticoids, and lopinavir/ritonavir.

These data have limitations due to the small size and methodology, though they provide cautious optimism for pregnancy outcomes for women with rheumatic disease given the increased risk of poor outcomes that have been reported in other series of pregnant women with COVID-19.","Bermas, Bonnie L; Gianfrancesco, Milena; Tanner, Helen L; Seet, Andrea M; Aguiar, Mathia C; Al Adhoubi, Nasra K; Emadi, Samar Al; Cunha, Bernardo M; Flood, Rachael; Kusevich, Daria A; McCarthy, Eoghan M; Patel, Naomi J; Ruderman, Eric; Sattui, Sebastian E; Sciascia, Savino; Siddique, Faizah; Valenzuela-Almada, Mario O; Wise, Leanna M; Worthing, Angus B; Zell, JoAnn; Bhana, Suleman; Costello, Wendy; Duarte-Garcia, Ali; Grainger, Rebecca; Gossec, Laure; Hausmann, Jonathan S; Hyrich, Kimme; Lawson-Tovey, Saskia; Liew, Jean W; Sirotich, Emily; Sparks, Jeffrey; Sufka, Paul; Wallace, Zachary; Machado, Pedro M; Strangfeld, Anja; Clowse, Megan E B; Yazdany, Jinoos; Robinson, Philip C",J. rheumatol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34470798/; https://doi.org/10.3899/jrheum.210480,695

A previous meta-analysis showed no association between new-onset hypertension and entire upper urinary urolithiasis after SWL. Recently, there have been some reports on this topic. Therefore, we aimed to examine the association between new-onset hypertension and nephrolithiasis after SWL therapy. METHODS: Embase, the Cochrane Central Search Library, and PubMed were used to search for reports on new-onset hypertension and patients with nephrolithiasis after SWL. A meta-analysis of the association between new-onset hypertension and nephrolithiasis after SWL was carried out. The data of relevant research were synthesized and the relative risk was computed. RESULTS: Seven eligible studies were included in our meta-analysis. There was a significant association between nephrolithiasis after SWL and new-onset hypertension. The overall relative risk with a 95% confidence interval was 1.21 (1.11–1.31) in a fixed-effects model. CONCLUSION: Our meta-analysis suggests an association between new-onset hypertension and patients with nephrolithiasis after SWL, which is in contrast with the finding of a previous meta-analysis.","Wu, Qiao; Liang, Rui; Huang, Yi; Tan, Chunlin; Zhu, Guangqiang; Chen, Yanjun; Cao, Liang; Zou, Bing; Li, Xin; Wang, Haiyun; Wang, Xiaojun; Tang, Tielong; Wu, Tao",J Int Med Res,https://doi.org/10.1177/03000605211002003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33794678/,695
677513,Economic Implications of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Plastic Surgery Community,2020-05-23,"Background The success of early dexamethasone therapy for hospitalised COVID-19 cases in treatment of Sars-CoV-2 infection may predominantly reflect its anti-inflammatory action against a hyperinflammation (HI) response. It is likely that there is substantial heterogeneity in HI responses in COVID-19. Methods Blood CRP, ferritin, neutrophil, lymphocyte and platelet counts were scored to assess HI (HI5) and combined with a validated measure of generalised medical deterioration (NEWS2) before day 2. Our primary outcome was 28 day mortality from early treatment with dexamethasone stratified by HI5-NEWS2 status. Findings Of 1265 patients, high risk of HI (high HI5-NEWS2) (n=367, 29.0%) conferred a strikingly increased mortality (36.0% vs 7.8%; Age adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 5.9; 95% CI 3.6-9.8, p<0.001) compared to the low risk group (n= 455, 36.0%). An intermediate risk group (n= 443, 35.0%) also showed significantly higher mortality than the low risk group (17.6% vs 7.8%), aHR 2.2, p=0.005). Early dexamethasone treatment conferred a 50.0% reduction in mortality in the high risk group (36.0% to 18.0%, aHR 0.56, p=0.007). The intermediate risk group showed a trend to reduction in mortality (17.8% to 10.3%, aHR 0.82, p=0.46) which was not observed in the low risk group (7.8% to 9.2%, aHR 1.4, p =0.31). Interpretation The HI5-NEWS2 measured at COVID-19 diagnosis, strongly predicts mortality at 28 days. Significant reduction in mortality with early dexamethasone treatment was only observed in the high risk group. Therefore, the HI5-NEWS2 score could be utilised to stratify randomised clinical trials to test whether intensified anti-inflammatory therapy would further benefit high risk patients and whether alternative approaches would benefit low risk groups. Considering its recognised morbidity, we suggest that early dexamethasone should not be routinely prescribed for HI5-NEWS2 low risk individuals with COVID-19 and clinicians should cautiously assess the risk benefit of this intervention.

684108,Breast Reconstruction and the Covid-19 Pandemic: Adapting Practice,2020-09-28,"As an effort to help contain the COVID-19 pandemic, large numbers of SARS-CoV-2 genomes have been sequenced from all continents. More than one million viral sequences are publicly available as of April 2021. Many studies estimate viral genealogies from these sequences, as these can provide valuable information about the spread of the pandemic across time and space. Additionally such data are a rich source of information about molecular evolutionary processes including natural selection, for example allowing the identification and investigating the spread of new variants conferring transmissibility and immunity evasion advantages to the virus. To validate new methods and to verify results resulting from these vast datasets, one needs an efficient simulator able to simulate the pandemic to approximate world-scale scenarios and generate viral genealogies of millions of samples. Here, we introduce a new fast simulator VGsim which addresses this problem. The simulation process is split into two phases. During the forward run the algorithm generates a chain of events reflecting the dynamics of the pandemic using an hierarchical version of the Gillespie algorithm. During the backward run a coalescent-like approach generates a tree genealogy of samples conditioning on the events chain generated during the forward run. Our software can model complex population structure, epistasis and immunity escape.

685112,COVID-19 and the Tsunami of Information,2020-09-20,"In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, it has been mandated to keep enlarged distances from others. We interviewed 136 German subjects over five weeks from the end of March to the end of April 2020 during the first wave of infections about their preferred interpersonal distance (IPD) before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic. In response to the pandemic, subjects adapted to distance requirements and preferred a larger IPD. This enlarged IPD was judged to partially persist after the pandemic crisis. People anticipated keeping more IPD to others even if there was no longer any risk of a SARS-CoV-2 infection. We also sampled two follow-up measurements, one in August, after the first wave of infections had been flattened, and one in October 2020, at the beginning of the second wave. Here, we observed that IPD varied with the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 within Germany. Overall, our data indicated that adaptation to distance requirements might happen asymmetrically. Preferred IPD rapidly adapted in response to distance requirements, but an enlargement of IPD may partially linger after the COVID-19 pandemic-crisis. We discuss our findings in light of proxemic theory and as an indicator for socio-cultural adaptation beyond the course of the pandemic.","Welsch, Robin; Wessels, Marlene; Bernhard, Christoph; Thönes, Sven; von Castell, Christoph",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-90714-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34075094/,695
686899,Invited editorial from the social media editor of JPRAS; Leadership in the time of COVID-19,2020-07-16,"To characterize the antigenic epitopes of the hemagglutinin (HA) protein of H1N1 influenza virus, a panel consisting of 84 clones of murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were generated using the HA proteins from the 2009 pandemic H1N1 vaccine lysate and the seasonal influenza H1N1(A1) vaccines. Thirty-three (39%) of the 84 mAbs were found to be strain-specific, and 6 (7%) of the 84 mAbs were subtype-specific. Twenty (24%) of the 84 mAbs recognized the common HA epitopes shared by 2009 pandemic H1N1, seasonal A1 (H1N1), and A3 (H3N2) influenza viruses. Twenty-five of the 84 clones recognized the common HA epitopes shared by the 2009 pandemic H1N1, seasonal A1 (H1N1) and A3 (H3N2) human influenza viruses, and H5N1 and H9N2 avian influenza viruses. We found that of the 16 (19%) clones of the 84 mAbs panel that were cross-reactive with human respiratory pathogens, 15 were made using the HA of the seasonal A1 (H1N1) virus and 1 was made using the HA of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus. Immunohistochemical analysis of the tissue microarray (TMA) showed that 4 of the 84 mAb clones cross-reacted with human tissue (brain and pancreas). Our results indicated that the influenza virus HA antigenic epitopes not only induce type-, subtype-, and strain-specific monoclonal antibodies against influenza A virus but also cross-reactive monoclonal antibodies against human tissues. Further investigations of these cross-reactive (heterophilic) epitopes may significantly improve our understanding of viral antigenic variation, epidemics, pathophysiologic mechanisms, and adverse effects of influenza vaccines.","Guo, Chun-yan; Tang, Yi-gui; Qi, Zong-li; Liu, Yang; Zhao, Xiang-rong; Huo, Xue-ping; Li, Yan; Feng, Qing; Zhao, Peng-hua; Wang, Xin; Li, Yuan; Wang, Hai-fang; Hu, Jun; Zhang, Xin-jian",Immunobiology,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0171298515000236; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25708705/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.imbio.2015.02.002; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0171298515000236,695
