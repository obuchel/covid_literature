14682,Vapor isotopic evidence for the worsening of winter air quality by anthropogenic combustion-derived water,2020-12-29,"Within the nervous system the highly specialized structure and function of nerve cells renders the pathogenesis of viral infections amazingly complex. In vivo and in vitro studies reveal that viruses may display tropism for distinct types of cells such as neurons, myelin-forming cells, or astrocytes. In neurons, RNA viruses mature in the cell body and in dendrites close to synapses, from which they can spread to synaptic endings. Undefined host factors and stage of differentiation may favor defective viral assembly, which, in turn, results in persistent infections of neurons. In myelin-forming cells, lytic infection results in degeneration of myelin and, consequently, in altered conduction in those axons that are ensheathed by a myelin-forming cell. In addition, breakdown of myelin may induce an autoimmune response, which then leads to further demyelination. Autoimmune demyelination may also occur when glial cells other than myelin-forming cells are infected. Astrocytes are prone to persistent infection or viral transformation.","Dubois-Dalcq, M.; Rentier, B.; Hooghe-Peters, E.; Haspel, M. V.; Knobler, R.

68185,PLASMA THYROXINE (T4) CONCENTRATION IN ZOO-KEPT BLACK-TAILED PRAIRIE DOGS (CYNOMYS LUDOVICIANUS).,2017,"For years, the dog, man's best friend, was the most widely employed scent-detector tool for civilian and military purposes. Recently, many studies highlighted the role of canine olfactory ability in the medical field, specifically in detecting different infectious, metabolic and neoplastic conditions. The objective of this literature review is to clarify the rationale behind dog's ability to detect diseases, to assess the possible application for COVID-19 detection and to discuss the evidence available on the matter. Available evidence shows that properly trained disease-detector dogs are an efficient tool for identification of specific disease-associated volatile organic compounds marker profiles for a particular disease. And since COVID-19 positive persons have a specific volatilome different from non-infected persons, they can be recognised by the dogs, by sniffing different body fluids consequently aiding in the diagnosis of COVID-19. Possible applications of dogs as COVID-19 detectors will be an easy real-time mobile diagnostic aid with low cost and good performance. More evidence is needed to be able to describe standardised measures concerning the best fluid to test, testing procedure, time of possible detection according to disease evolution, risks associated with the dog exposure and to translate the good results in study setting into the real-life operational one.","Sakr, Rania; Ghsoub, Cedra; Rbeiz, Celine; Lattouf, Vanessa; Riachy, Rachelle; Haddad, Chadia; Zoghbi, Marouan",Postgraduate medical journal,https://doi.org/10.1136/postgradmedj-2020-139410; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33574179/,662
319614,"News Feature: To counter the pandemic, clinicians bank on repurposed drugs",2020,"The emerging pathogen SARS-CoV2 causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global public health challenge To the present day, COVID-19 had affected more than 40 million people worldwide The exploration and the development of new bioactive compounds with cost-effective and specific anti-COVID 19 therapeutic power is the prime focus of the current medical research Thus, the exploitation of the molecular docking technique has become essential in the discovery and development of new drugs, to better understand drug-target interactions in their original environment This work consists of studying the binding affinity and the type of interactions, through molecular docking, between 54 compounds from Moroccan medicinal plants, dextran sulfate and heparin (compounds not derived from medicinal plants), and 3CLpro-SARS-CoV-2, ACE2, and the post fusion core of 2019-nCoV S2 subunit The PDB files of the target proteins and prepared herbal compounds (ligands) were subjected for docking to AutoDock Vina using UCSF Chimera, which provides a list of potential complexes based on the criteria of form complementarity of the natural compound with their binding affinities The results of molecular docking revealed that Taxol, Rutin, Genkwanine, and Luteolin-glucoside have a high affinity with ACE2 and 3CLpro Therefore, these natural compounds can have 2 effects at once, inhibiting 3CLpro and preventing recognition between the virus and ACE2 These compounds may have a potential therapeutic effect against SARS-CoV2, and therefore natural anti-COVID-19 compounds [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Bioinformatics & Biology Insights is the property of Sage Publications Inc and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","Nouadi, Badreddine Ezaouine Abdelkarim El Messal Mariame Blaghen Mohamed Bennis Faiza Chegdani Fatima",Bioinformatics &amp; Biology Insights,,662

Or to be more precise, if not an end, then the quickest and most effective reduction of mortality and morbidity from the disease in every country where infections exist. The forthcoming theme issue of IJME explores a long-standing ethical concern in research with human beings, focused mainly on a question posed about vaccine research for prevention of Covid-19. Contributors from six continents address the question: In what circumstances - if any â is it ethically acceptable to use a research design in which the control group in a randomised, controlled trial (RCT) receives a placebo instead of a vaccine already approved for emergency use by regulatory bodies? That ethical question is not new.","Macklin, Ruth",Indian J Med Ethics,,662

643318,Consumptive coagulopathy of severe yellow fever occurs independently of hepatocellular tropism and massive hepatic injury,2020-12-22,"BACKGROUND: Growing concerns over ethical issues in mentoring in medicine and surgery have hindered efforts to reinitiate mentoring for Palliative Care (PC) physicians following the easing of COVID-19 restrictions. Ranging from the misappropriation of mentee’s work to bullying, ethical issues in mentoring are attributed to poor understanding and structuring of mentoring programs, underlining the need for a consistent approach to mentoring practices. METHODS: Given diverse practices across different settings and the employ of various methodologies, a novel approach to narrative reviews (NR)s is proposed to summarize, interpret, and critique prevailing data on novice mentoring. To overcome prevailing concerns surrounding the reproducibility and transparency of narrative reviews, the Systematic Evidenced Based Approach (SEBA) adopts a structured approach to searching and summarizing the included articles and employed concurrent content and thematic analysis that was overseen by a team of experts. RESULTS: A total of 18 915 abstracts were reviewed, 62 full text articles evaluated and 41 articles included. Ten themes/categories were ascertained identified including Nature; Stakeholders; Relationship; Approach; Environment; Benefits; Barriers; Assessments; Theories and Definitions. CONCLUSION: By compiling and scrutinizing prevailing practice it is possible to appreciate the notion of the mentoring ecosystem which sees each mentee, mentor, and host organization brings with them their own microenvironment that contains their respective goals, abilities, and contextual considerations. Built around competency based mentoring stages, it is possible to advance a flexible yet consistent novice mentoring framework.","Krishna, Lalit Kumar Radha; Tan, Lorraine Hui En; Ong, Yun Ting; Tay, Kuang Teck; Hee, Jia Min; Chiam, Min; Chia, Elisha Wan Ying; Sheri, Krish; Tan, Xiu Hui; Teo, Yao Hao; Kow, Cheryl Shumin; Mason, Stephen; Toh, Ying Pin",J Med Educ Curric Dev,https://doi.org/10.1177/2382120520957649; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33015366/,662
