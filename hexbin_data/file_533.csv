4251,4251,4251,Quantifying the relative impact of contact heterogeneity on MRSA transmission in ICUs - a modelling study,14.330697,11.434343,2020-01-03,"BACKGROUND: An efficient surface cleaning strategy would first target cleaning to surfaces that make large contributions to the risk of infections. METHODS: In this study, we used data from the literature about methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and developed an ordinary differential equations based mathematical model to quantify the impact of contact heterogeneity on MRSA transmission in a hypothetical 6-bed intensive care unit (ICU). The susceptible patients are divided into two types, these who are cared by the same nurse as the MRSA infected patient (Type 1) and these who are not (Type 2). RESULTS: The results showed that the mean MRSA concentration on three kinds of susceptible patient nearby surfaces was significantly linearly associated with the hand-touch frequency (p < 0.05). The noncompliance of daily cleaning on patient nearby high-touch surfaces (HTSs) had the most impact on MRSA transmission. If the HTSs were not cleaned, the MRSA exposure to Type 1 and 2 susceptible patients would increase 118.4% (standard deviation (SD): 33.0%) and 115.4% (SD: 30.5%) respectively. The communal surfaces (CSs) had the least impact, if CSs were not cleaned, the MRSA exposure to Type 1 susceptible patient would only increase 1.7% (SD: 1.3). The impact of clinical equipment (CE) differed largely for two types of susceptible patients. If the CE was not cleaned, the exposure to Type 1 patients would only increase 8.4% (SD: 3.0%), while for Type 2 patients, it can increase 70.4% (SD: 25.4%). CONCLUSIONS: This study provided a framework to study the pathogen concentration dynamics on environmental surfaces and quantitatively showed the importance of cleaning patient nearby HTSs on controlling the nosocomial infection transmission via contact route.","Lei, Hao; Jones, Rachael M.; Li, Yuguo",BMC Infect Dis,533,3

In epidemics studies, mathematical modeling is used in particular to reach a better understanding of some neglected diseases (dengue, malaria, …) and of new emerging ones (SARS, influenza A,….) of big agglomerates. Such studies offer new challenges both from the modeling point of view (searching for simple models which capture the main characteristics of the disease spreading), data analysis and mathematical complexity. We are facing often with complex networks especially when modeling the city dynamics. Such networks can be static (in first approximation) and homogeneous, static and not homogeneous and/or not static (when taking into account the city structure, micro‐climates, people circulation, etc.). The objective being studying epidemics dynamics and being able to predict its spreading.","Boatto, Stefanella; Khouri, Renata Stella; Solerman, Lucas; Codeço, Claudia; Bonnet, Catherine",AIP Conf Proc,533,19

The dynamic quarantine is based in epidemic disease control methods and in the principle ‘assume guilty before proven inocent’. This means that the host is blocked whenever its behavior looks suspicious. After a short time, the quarantined computer is released. The nonlinear infection rate is used to capture the dynamics of overcrowded infectious networks and high viral loads. We simulate numerically the model for distinct values of the quarantine times. We observe that increasing the quarantine time decreases the number of infectious hosts in the network.","Pinto, Carla M.A.",AIP Conf Proc,533,1

However, a concise scoring method has only been proposed for pediatric patients, and not for adult patients yet. Here, we developed and validated a concise scoring method using data on patients admitted to ICUs in 21 Japanese hospitals from 2012 to 2014. We randomly assigned to either discovery or validation cohorts, identified the factors significantly associated with persistent AKI using a multivariable logistic regression model in the discovery cohort to establish a scoring system, and assessed the validity of the scoring in the validation cohort using receiver operating characteristic analysis and the calibration slope. Among 8,320 patients admitted to the ICUs, persistent AKI was present in 1,064 (12.8%) patients. In the discovery cohort (n = 4,151), ‘hyperbilirubinemia’, ‘sepsis’ and ‘ventilator and/or vasoactive’ with small changes in serum creatinine were selected to establish the scoring. In the validation cohort (n = 4,169), the predicting model based on this scoring had a c-statistic of 0.79 (95%CI, 0.77–0.81) and was well calibrated. In conclusion, we established a concise scoring method to identify potential patients with persistent AKI, which performed well in the validation cohort.","Matsuura, Ryo; Iwagami, Masao; Moriya, Hidekazu; Ohtake, Takayasu; Hamasaki, Yoshifumi; Nangaku, Masaomi; Doi, Kent; Kobayashi, Shuzo; Noiri, Eisei",Sci Rep,533,1

Lack of evidence on costs and cost-effectiveness of community-led implementation of HI and LSM has hindered wide-scale adoption. This study presents an incremental cost analysis of community-led implementation of HI and LSM, in a cluster-randomized, factorial design trial, in addition to standard national malaria control interventions in a rural area (25,000 people), in southern Malawi. METHODS: In the trial, LSM comprised draining, filling, and Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis-based larviciding, while house improvement (henceforth HI) involved closing of eaves and gaps on walls, screening windows/ventilation spaces with wire mesh, and doorway modifications. Communities implemented all interventions. Costs were estimated retrospectively using the ‘ingredients approach’, combining ‘bottom-up’ and ‘top-down approaches’, from the societal perspective. To estimate the cost of independently implementing each intervention arm, resources shared between trial arms (e.g. overheads) were allocated to each consuming arm using proxies developed based on share of resource input quantities consumed. Incremental implementation costs (in 2017 US$) are presented for HI-only, LSM-only and HI + LSM arms. In sensitivity analyses, the effect of varying costs of important inputs on estimated costs was explored. RESULTS: The total economic programme costs of community-led HI and LSM implementation was $626,152. Incremental economic implementation costs of HI, LSM and HI + LSM were estimated as $27.04, $25.06 and $33.44, per person per year, respectively. Project staff, transport and labour costs, but not larvicide or screening material, were the major cost drivers across all interventions. Costs were sensitive to changes in staff costs and population covered. CONCLUSIONS: In the trial, the incremental economic costs of community-led HI and LSM implementation were high compared to previous house improvement and LSM studies. Several factors, including intervention design, year-round LSM implementation and low human population density could explain the high costs. The factorial trial design necessitated use of proxies to allocate costs shared between trial arms, which limits generalizability where different designs are used. Nevertheless, costs may inform planners of similar intervention packages where cost-effectiveness is known. Trial registration Not applicable.

Her documentary Under the Dome further shows how the internet has transformed the ecology of media and provided innovative platforms for social engagement. Chai’s embracing her own feelings of vulnerability, which dominated the beginning of her career, and using it to channel public feelings and drive news reporting has made her a distinctively controversial media personality. Her leaving the CCTV can be viewed as a self-marginalization that helps her sustain that vulnerability, through which she gains resilience and critical power. The use of maternal voice in Under the Dome exemplifies her use of the power of vulnerability in its most mature form.

These 20 evaluation tasks on Information Extraction (IE), management, and Information Retrieval (IR) in 2013–2019 have been popular—as demonstrated by the large number of team registrations, submissions, papers, their included authors, and citations (748, 177, 184, 741, and 1299, respectively, up to and including 2018)—and achieved statistically significant improvements in the processing quality. In 2020, CLEF eHealth is calling for participants to contribute to the following two tasks: The 2020 Task 1 on IE focuses on term coding for clinical textual data in Spanish. The terms considered are extracted from clinical case records and they are mapped onto the Spanish version of the International Classification of Diseases, the 10th Revision, including also textual evidence spans for the clinical codes. The 2020 Task 2 is a novel extension of the most popular and established task in CLEF eHealth on CHS. This IR task uses the representative web corpus used in the 2018 challenge, but now also spoken queries, as well as textual transcripts of these queries, are offered to the participants. The task is structured into a number of optional subtasks, covering ad-hoc search using the spoken queries, textual transcripts of the spoken queries, or provided automatic speech-to-text conversions of the spoken queries.

The analysis of these decrees can be used to make a first assessment of the implications of the COVID crisis on labour markets, and also to speculate on mid and long-term developments, since the most and least affected sectors are probably going to continue to operate differently until a vaccine or other long-term solution is found. Using an ad-hoc extraction of EU-LFS data, we apply this classification to the analysis of employment in Germany, Italy and Spain but also UK, Poland and Sweden, in order to cover the whole spectrum of institutional labour market settings within Europe. Our results, in line with recent literature, show that the employment impact is asymmetric within and between countries. In particular, the countries that are being hardest hit by the pandemic itself (Spain and Italy, and also the UK) are the countries more likely to suffer the worst employment implications of the confinement, because of their productive specialisation and labour market institutions. Indeed, these were also the labour markets that were more vulnerable before the crisis: characterised by high unemployment and precarious work (especially temporary contracts).","Fana, Marta; Torrejón Pérez, Sergio; Fernández-Macías, Enrique",J,533,13

Social workers are working at the front lines responding to the current COVID-19 pandemic in a variety of health care practice settings, including nursing homes, however it is unclear how social workers perceive their preparedness during this time. This study employed a cross-sectional survey to nursing home social workers via social media on feelings of preparedness for COVID-19, what has been most professionally helpful for social workers during these times in their role in COVID-19, as well as demographic questions. Demographic data were analyzed using SPSS and qualitative data were analyzed using the rigorous and accelerated data reduction (RADaR) technique. Data are based on a sample of 63 (N=63) nursing home social workers. Findings revealed that while some social workers felt prepared for the coronavirus, many respondents stated that they were unprepared to meet the demands and challenges they were facing. Moreover, participants shared that professional support was critically important to get through COVID-19. These findings are important, as social workers are tasked with ensuring each resident attains their highest level of psychosocial well-being, which can be achieved only when nursing home staff are supported. Findings from the present study suggest that additional support for nursing home staff ought to include peer mentoring and mutual support. Additionally, improved leadership across health care settings is worth assessing.","Miller, Vivian; Fields, Noelle; Kusmaul, Nancy; Anderson, Keith; Maxwell, Christy",Innov Aging,533,16

Here, we explored the role of AGE, glycated albumin, sRAGE and its different forms, cRAGE and esRAGE, as prognostic factors for mortality in 111 advanced CKD patients. The median follow-up time was 39 months. AGE were quantified by fluorescence, sRAGE and its forms by ELISA. Malnutrition was screened by the Malnutrition Inflammation Score (MIS). The Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to assess the association of variables with all-cause mortality. Mean levels of sRAGE, esRAGE and cRAGE were 2318 ± 1224, 649 ± 454 and 1669 ± 901 pg/mL. The mean value of cRAGE/esRAGE was 2.82 ± 0.96. AGE were 3026 ± 766 AU and MIS 6.0 ± 4.7. eGFR correlated negatively with AGE, sRAGE, esRAGE and cRAGE, but not with cRAGE/esRAGE. Twenty-eight patients died.

This is a break with one of the main advantages of lambda-calculus: confluence, which means results are independent from the choice of strategy. We present a probabilistic lambda-calculus where the probabilistic operator is decomposed into two syntactic constructs: a generator, which represents a probabilistic event; and a consumer, which acts on the term depending on a given event. The resulting calculus, the Probabilistic Event Lambda-Calculus, is confluent, and interprets the call-by-name and call-by-value strategies through different interpretations of the probabilistic operator into our generator and consumer constructs. We present two notions of reduction, one via fine-grained local rewrite steps, and one by generation and consumption of probabilistic events. Simple types for the calculus are essentially standard, and they convey strong normalization. We demonstrate how we can encode call-by-name and call-by-value probabilistic evaluation.","Dal Lago, Ugo; Guerrieri, Giulio; Heijltjes, Willem",Foundations of Software Science and Computation Structures,533,22

The notion of computability is defined through Turing machines with infinite inputs which can produce the corresponding infinite outputs in the limit. We use non-deterministic transducers equipped with registers, an extension of register automata with outputs, to specify functions. Such transducers may not define functions but more generally relations of data [Formula: see text] -words, and we show that it is PSpace-complete to test whether a given transducer defines a function. Then, given a function defined by some register transducer, we show that it is decidable (and again, PSpace-c) whether such function is computable. As for the known finite alphabet case, we show that computability and continuity coincide for functions defined by register transducers, and show how to decide continuity. We also define a subclass for which those problems are PTime.","Exibard, Léo; Filiot, Emmanuel; Reynier, Pierre-Alain",Foundations of Software Science and Computation Structures,533,16

In this article we firstly explore a philosophy of biodigitalism as a new paradigm closely linked to bioinformationalism. Both involve the mutual interaction and integration of information and biology, which leads us into discussion of biodigital convergence. As a unified ecosystem, this allows us to resolve problems that isolated disciplinary capabilities cannot, creating new knowledge ecologies within a constellation of technoscience. To illustrate our arrival at this historical flash point via several major epistemological shifts in the post-war period, we venture a tentative typology. The convergence between biology and information reconfigures all levels of theory and practice, and even critical reason itself now requires a biodigital interpretation oriented towards ecosystems and coordinated Earth systems. In this understanding, neither the digital humanities, the biohumanities, nor the posthumanities sit outside of biodigitalism. Instead, posthumanism is but one form of biodigitalism that mediates the biohumanities and the digital humanities, no longer preoccupied with the tradition of the subject, but with the constellation of forces shaping the future of human ontologies. This heralds a new biopolitics which brings the philosophy of race, class, gender, and intelligence, into a compelling dialog with genomics and information.","Peters, Michael A.; Jandrić, Petar; Hayes, Sarah",Postdigit Sci Educ,533,1

The overall effect of semen on viral infection and transmission have yet to be fully investigated. In the present study, we aimed at the effect of seminal plasma (SP) on viral infection by focusing on the mumps viral (MuV) infection of HeLa cells. MuV efficiently infected HeLa cells in vitro. MuV infection was strongly inhibited by the pre-treatment of viruses with SP. SP inhibited MuV infection through the impairment of the virus’s attachment to cells. The antiviral activity of SP was resistant to the treatment of SP with boiling water, Proteinase K, RNase A, and DNase I, suggesting that the antiviral factor would not be proteins and nucleic acids. PNGase or PLA2 treatments did not abrogate the antiviral effect of SP against MuV. Further, we showed that the prostatic fluid (PF) showed similar inhibition as SP, whereas the epididymal fluid and seminal vesicle extract did not inhibit MuV infection. Both SP and PF also inhibited MuV infection of other cell types, including another human cervical carcinoma cell line C33a, mouse primary epididymal epithelial cells, and Sertoli cell line 15P1. Moreover, this inhibitory effect was not specific to MuV, as the herpes simplex virus 1, dengue virus 2, and adenovirus 5 infections were also inhibited by SP and PF. Our findings suggest that SP contains a prostate-derived pan-antiviral factor that may limit the sexual transmission of various viruses.","Chen, Ran; Zhang, Wenjing; Gong, Maolei; Wang, Fei; Wu, Han; Liu, Weihua; Gao, Yunxiao; Liu, Baoxing; Chen, Song; Lu, Wei; Yu, Xiaoqin; Liu, Aijie; Han, Ruiqin; Chen, Yongmei; Han, Daishu",Front Immunol,533,1

However, there have been no attempts to create a comprehensive framework for a general understanding of digital well-being and the new roles and responsibilities that emerge from it in the tourism domain. Thus, this paper looks at understanding digital well-being in general and its concomitant applications in the tourism domain. After mapping characteristic digital well-being approaches and examples, we foresee the need for establishing a digital well-being continuum between everyday life and tourism that rests on three new sets of roles and responsibilities for the tourism domain, grouped around the need for adopting digital well-being philosophy in tourism, setting up new policies, and designing novel services and experiences.","Stankov, Uglješa; Gretzel, Ulrike",Inf Technol Tourism,533,1

Medical systems had to adapt to better focus on patients with a highly communicable disease, while continuing to provide essential services. Even though many countries saw a decrease in traumatic injuries during the initial periods, orthopaedic trauma services nevertheless had to adapt accordingly to system-wide organizational changes. While each country took their individual approaches to address the pandemic, there were also consistencies in how musculoskeletal injuries and conditions were handled during these early stages of the pandemic.

In some regions, the implementation of large-scale bike-sharing systems and improved cycling infrastructure are two of the factors enabling this growth. An increase in non-motorized modes of transportation makes our cities more human, decreases pollution, traffic, and improves quality of life. In many cities around the world, urban planners and policymakers are looking at cycling as a sustainable way of improving urban mobility. Although bike-sharing systems generate abundant data about their users’ travel habits, most cities still rely on traditional tools and methods for planning and policy-making. Recent technological advances enable the collection and analysis of large amounts of data about urban mobility, which can serve as a solid basis for evidence-based policy-making. In this paper, we introduce a novel analytical method that can be used to process millions of bike-sharing trips and analyze bike-sharing mobility, abstracting relevant mobility flows across specific urban areas. Backed by a visualization platform, this method provides a comprehensive set of analytical tools to support public authorities in making data-driven policy and planning decisions. This paper illustrates the use of the method with a case study of the Greater Boston bike-sharing system and, as a result, presents new findings about that particular system. Finally, an assessment with expert users showed that this method and tool were considered very useful, relatively easy to use and that they intend to adopt the tool in the near future.","Kon, Fabio; Ferreira, Éderson Cássio; de Souza, Higor Amario; Duarte, Fábio; Santi, Paolo; Ratti, Carlo",Public Transp,533,1

PCOS is characterized by hyperandrogenism and ovulatory dysfunction. Women with PCOS have a high prevalence of obesity, insulin resistance (IR), increased blood pressure (BP), and activation of the renin angiotensin system (RAS). Effective evidence-based therapeutics to ameliorate the cardiometabolic complications in PCOS are lacking. The sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor Empagliflozin (EMPA) reduces BP and hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes mellitus. We hypothesized that hyperandrogenemia upregulates renal SGLT2 expression and that EMPA ameliorates cardiometabolic complications in a hyperandrogenemic PCOS model. Four-week-old female Sprague Dawley rats were treated with dihydrotestosterone (DHT) for 90 days, and EMPA was co-administered for the last three weeks. DHT upregulated renal SGLT2, SGLT4, and GLUT2, but downregulated SGLT3 mRNA expression. EMPA decreased DHT-mediated increases in fat mass, plasma leptin, and BP, but failed to decrease plasma insulin, HbA1c, or albuminuria. EMPA decreased DHT-mediated increase in renal angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AGT1R) mRNA and protein expression. In summary, SGLT2 inhibition proved beneficial in adiposity and BP reduction in a hyperandrogenemic PCOS model; however, additional therapies may be needed to improve IR and renal injury.","Pruett, Jacob E.; Torres Fernandez, Edgar D.; Everman, Steven J.; Vinson, Ruth M.; Davenport, Kacey; Logan, Madelyn K.; Ye, Stephanie A.; Romero, Damian G.; Yanes Cardozo, Licy L.",Int J Mol Sci,533,13

Amongst this criticism, Short Food Supply Chains (SFSCs) have emerged as a promising sustainable alternative to the industrialized agri-food supply systems. In recent years there have been some attempts to explore the relationship between SFSCs and sustainability, but these are mostly theoretical discussions and lacks empirical validation. This study, therefore, attempts to provide empirical validation of the SFSCs and sustainability linkages. Additionally, from the theoretical perspective, our work extends the traditional triple bottom line constructs and explores two extra dimensions of sustainability in the food supply chain system, namely, governance and culture, thus exploring five dimensions of sustainability. Furthermore, while SFSCs have proven to improve farmers’ livelihoods and reconnect producers with consumers, little or no attention has been given to understand the consumers' attitudes towards the SFSC practices. Therefore, this study aims to explore the customers’ attitudes towards participating in SFSCs through the concept of a moral economy and personal relationship. Based on the 532 valid responses from Chinese consumers, our study shows that all five pillars of sustainability, moral economy and Chinese relationship have a positive influence on consumers’ participation in SFSCs. With its intuitive benefits, the economic pillar emerged as the most approved factor by the participants. Interestingly our findings show that the social aspect is less prominent than others, which is contrary to existing studies conducted in developed countries.","Wang, Meng; Kumar, Vikas; Ruan, Ximing; Saad, Mohammed; Garza-Reyes, Jose Arturo; Kumar, Anil",Oper Manag Res,533,1

Moreover, recent research such as the few-shot learning can create highly realistic personalized fake images with only a few images. Therefore, the threat of Deepfake to be used for a variety of malicious intents such as propagating fake images and videos becomes prevalent. And detecting these machine-generated fake images has been more challenging than ever. In this work, we propose a light-weight robust fine-tuning neural network-based classifier architecture called Fake Detection Fine-tuning Network (FDFtNet), which is capable of detecting many of the new fake face image generation models, and can be easily combined with existing image classification networks and fine-tuned on a few datasets. In contrast to many existing methods, our approach aims to reuse popular pre-trained models with only a few images for fine-tuning to effectively detect fake images. The core of our approach is to introduce an image-based self-attention module called Fine-Tune Transformer that uses only the attention module and the down-sampling layer. This module is added to the pre-trained model and fine-tuned on a few data to search for new sets of feature space to detect fake images. We experiment with our FDFtNet on the GANs-based dataset (Progressive Growing GAN) and Deepfake-based dataset (Deepfake and Face2Face) with a small input image resolution of 64[Formula: see text] 64 that complicates detection. Our FDFtNet achieves an overall accuracy of 90.29% in detecting fake images generated from the GANs-based dataset, outperforming the state-of-the-art.","Jeon, Hyeonseong; Bang, Youngoh; Woo, Simon S.",ICT Systems Security and Privacy Protection,533,1

Mobile technology, as a competitive and innovative marketing tool in providing services, has become an essential technology for success in the banking industry. This technology provides banks with the opportunity to provide products and services proportionate to the exact needs of customers and can help them gain a competitive advantage in the turbulent environment of the banking industry. Therefore, identifying the factors influencing the acceptance of mobile banking has been an important subject for and the focus of many researches. These researches have explored this phenomenon mainly based on the traditional theories related to the adoption of new technology. It is important to note that the relevant traditional theories, by valuing some actors in the process of accepting mobile banking, have taken a simplistic approach and ignored the network of multiple actors active in the process. By emphasizing the network of actors with complex and interactive relationships that are effective in accepting mobile banking, this article has discussed this phenomenon from the perspective of ANT theory. Thus, by reviewing the main concepts of ANT, we emphasized its importance in studying the process of accepting new service technologies, including mobile banking, and finally, by adopting a Socio-ecological attitude of ANT, we provided a conceptual model to examine the acceptance of mobile technology.","Mirbargkar, Seyed Mozaffar; Ebrahimi, Pejman; Soleimani, Maryam",Contemporary Applications of Actor Network Theory,533,17

The analysis reveals a hopeful and resilient approach to innovative rural education and scholarship, and collectively, important evidence to speak against an often deficit view of rural education. Three patterns are revealed across the studies, namely: the importance of place-attentive strategies, the importance of joined up alliances to maximise resources and networks and finally, the need to utilise alternative methodologies and frameworks that have a starting point of difference rather than deficit for any rural initiative or approach. In short, a tripartite of place, people and power are offered as essential to any effective rural education innovation. And given the highly contextual nature of this tripartite, it is clear that while the specific innovations presented in the current studies can not necessarily be transplanted or adopted wholesale, these three essential elements are a true foundation for future rural education studies and scholars to explore.","White, Simone; Downey, Jayne",Rural Education Across the World,533,1

To this end, I analyzed 398,037 Twitter accounts. The results reveal that the Twitter accounts of relevant authorities gained a significant number of new Twitter followers during the pandemic. The Twitter users who joined during the pandemic were rather passive; they tweeted and liked fewer tweets than Twitter users who registered in the months prior to the pandemic. They also chose to follow Twitter accounts predominantly related to news, politics and governmental agencies. These findings suggest that during the pandemic, numerous information-seeking citizens joined Twitter for the purpose of obtaining information about public health matters, which in turn suggests that authorities should incorporate Twitter into their information dissemination tools, especially during emergencies, to meet the public demand for information.","Haman, Michael",,533,1

Instead of ceasing our simulation programme, we adapted it to comply with local infection control guidelines. We devised in-situ high-fidelity ward round simulations for all levels of trainee, from newly qualified doctors to senior registrars. METHOD: The ward round consisted of three simulated patients with a range of conditions appropriate for the level of trainee, role-played by faculty members. The simulations were offered to all Foundation Year Doctors, Junior Middle Grade Doctors and Surgical Speciality Trainees with all participants wearing Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) according to COVID-19 infection control policy. RESULTS: A total of 81 trainees took part in the simulations. Almost all reported it as ‘very useful’ and that it improved confidence in progressing to the next stage of their career. Trainees also found it enjoyable and that personalised feedback allowed them to identify areas for development. CONCLUSIONS: We have shown that ward round simulations can be run safely and effectively despite current COVID-19 restrictions. Even senior trainees found that a ward round simulation was useful and were keen to see it become a regular part of deanery teaching.","Metcalfe, K; Pollard, J; Jeffreys, D; Thomas, I",Br J Surg,533,1

METHODS: In 118 IBD patients with COVID-19, clinical and endoscopic IBD activity, laboratory markers (ESR, CRP, hemoglobin (Hb), fecal calprotectin(FCP)), and medication utilization was assessed up to 6 months post-infection and compared to during infection or up to 6 months prior to infection. Active disease was defined by a Harvey Bradshaw Index > 4, Mayo Score ≥2, SES-CD ≥2, Mayo endoscopic score ≥1. 16S rRNA analysis was used to evaluate microbiome composition in a subset of 12 patients before and after COVID-19. RESULTS: Although upper respiratory (86.6%) and new GI symptoms (39.1%) were common in patients with IBD, there was no significant change in IBD clinical disease activity (Pre vs. Post-COVID-19 HBI: 4.7 vs. 4.9; partial Mayo: 3.0 vs. 2.1), endoscopic evaluation (Pre vs. Post-COVID-19 SES-CD: 7.2 vs. 8.9, Mayo endoscopic score: 1.5 vs. 1.7), or laboratory markers (Pre vs. Post-COVID-19 CRP: 1.2 vs. 1.3; ESR: 25 vs. 26; Hb 12.8 vs. 13.2; FCP: 388 vs. 250) up to 7 months post-COVID-19 compared to the 6 months prior to infection (Table 1). Overall active disease was present in 60% of the cohort prior to COVID-19 and 55% and 59% during and post-COVID-19, respectively. More subjects (8.5%) reported a delay in medical therapy during COVID-19, but there were no differences in the need for corticosteroids, a change in medical therapy, or IBD-related surgery or hospitalization during or post-COVID-19 compared to the prior 6 months. Microbiome composition stratified by underlying IBD disease activity, but did not show significant change post-COVID-19 (Figure 1).

But it remains unclear how individual behaviours could exacerbate or protect against adverse changes in mental health. AIMS: To examine the associations between specific activities (or time use) and mental health and well-being among people during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: Data were from the UCL COVID-19 Social Study, a panel study collecting data weekly during the COVID-19 pandemic. The analytical sample consisted of 55 204 adults living in the UK who were followed up for the 11-week strict lockdown period from 21 March to 31 May 2020. Data were analysed using fixed-effects and Arellano–Bond models. RESULTS: Changes in time spent on a range of activities were associated with changes in mental health and well-being. After controlling for bidirectionality, behaviours involving outdoor activities such as gardening and exercising predicted subsequent improvements in mental health and well-being, whereas increased time spent following news about COVID-19 predicted declines in mental health and well-being. CONCLUSIONS: These results are relevant to the formulation of guidance for people obliged to spend extended periods in isolation during health emergencies and may help the public to maintain well-being during future lockdowns and pandemics.","Bu, Feifei; Steptoe, Andrew; Mak, Hei Wan; Fancourt, Daisy",,533,1

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the contribution of dry-bulb temperature, when vapor pressure was matched, on the thermoregulatory, perceptual and performance responses to a 30-min cycling work trial. METHODS Fourteen trained male cyclists (age: 32 ± 12 year; height: 178 ± 6 cm; mass: 76 ± 9 kg; [Formula: see text]: 59 ± 9 mL kg-1 min-1; body surface area: 1.93 ± 0.12 m2; peak power output: 393 ± 53 W) volunteered, and underwent 1 exercise bout in moderate heat (MOD: 34.9 ± 0.2 °C, 50.1 ± 1.1% relative humidity) and 1 in mild heat (MILD: 29.2 ± 0.2 °C, 69.4 ± 0.9% relative humidity) matched for vapor pressure (2.8 ± 0.1 kPa), with trials counterbalanced. RESULTS Despite a higher weighted mean skin temperature during MOD (36.3 ± 0.5 vs. 34.5 ± 0.6 °C, p < 0.01), none of rectal temperature (38.0 ± 0.3 vs. 37.9 ± 0.4 °C, p = 0.30), local sweat rate (1.0 ± 0.3 vs. 0.9 ± 0.4 mg cm-2 min-1, p = 0.28), cutaneous blood flow (283 ± 116 vs. 287 ± 105 PU, p = 0.90), mean power output (206 ± 37 vs. 205 ± 41 W, p = 0.87) or total work completed (371 ± 64 vs. 369 ± 70 kJ, p = 0.77) showed any difference between environments during the work trial. However, all perceptual measures (perceived exertion, thermal discomfort, thermal sensation, skin wettedness, pleasantness, all p < 0.05) were affected detrimentally during MOD compared to MILD. CONCLUSION In a warm and compensable environment, dry-bulb temperature did not influence high-intensity cycling performance when vapor pressure was maintained, whilst the perceptual responses were affected.","Lei, Tze-Huan; Schlader, Zachary J; Che Muhamed, Ahmad Munir; Zheng, Huixin; Stannard, Stephen R; Kondo, Narihiko; Cotter, James D; Mündel, Toby",European journal of applied physiology,533,24

Although its incidence rate has fallen since 2010, this ratio dramatically stalled between 2014 and 2018. New fast and optimized tools in vaccine analysis and seroconversion testing are critically needed. We developed a clinical diagnostic device based on piezo-actuated nanoresonators that perform as quantitative in situ calibrated nano-bio sensors for specific detection of multiple target molecules in serum samples. The immunoassay successfully diagnoses humoral immune responses induced by malaria vaccine candidates and reveals the timeline and stage of the infection. We applied the newly developed strategy to a variety of different samples, from pure antibody/vaccine solutions, to blood samples from clinical trials on both naïve and pre-exposed malaria volunteers from sub-Saharan countries. Our nanomechanical assay provides a direct one-step label-free quantitative immunoassay that is on par with the gold-standard, multi-step enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). We achieve a limit of detection of few pg ml-1, or sub-pM concentrations. The 6 μl sample volume allows more than 50 experiments from one finger prick. Furthermore, we simultaneously detected multiple analytes by differential functionalization of multiple sensors in parallel.

Less is known about costs and other outcomes. Our aim was to evaluate the costs and outcomes between transumbilical laparoscopic-assisted appendectomy (TULAA) and multiport laparoscopic appendectomy (MLA). METHODS IRB-approved retrospective review (September 2010-July 2013) of institutional medical records identified 372 pediatric patients undergoing laparoscopic appendectomy. Outcomes included costs, LOS and readmission. Costs were fully loaded operating costs from the hospital's cost accounting database. Generalized linear regression was used to assess costs of MLA and TULAA. A subgroup analysis was performed using only patients with non-perforated appendicitis. RESULTS There were 132 patients (35.5%) that underwent TULAA while 240 patients (65.5%) underwent MLA. Compared to MLA, TULAA was associated with decreased operative time (0.6 vs. 1.0h, p<0.0001), used in comparable proportions of interval appendectomies, but was performed less often for perforated appendicitis (9.8% vs. 22.9%, p=0.002).

The MMP-9 activity was significantly higher in mammary secretions from infected quarters compared with uninfected quarters at day 7, 14 and 21 of involution. The increased expression of MMP-2 and -9 in mammary tissue as well as the high levels of activity observed in mammary secretion from infected quarters compared with uninfected quarters during active involution, strongly suggests that these gelatinases could contribute to degradation of mammary tissue components during chronic S. aureus IMI. The MMPs/TIMPs imbalance could lead to greater proteolysis and potentially more damage to mammary tissue in S. aureus-infected quarters.","Beccaria, Camila; Velázquez, Natalia S; Chervaz, Victoria; Pirola, Silvana I; Baravalle, Celina; Renna, María S; Calvinho, Luis F; Dallard, Bibiana E",Research in veterinary science,533,16

The diagnostic performance of Bovine Enterichek was evaluated in comparison with a multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction assay (mrtPCR). One hundred fecal samples were procured from diagnostic submissions to Iowa State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory and were used for the assessment. The agreement quotient (kappa) in results for each pathogen between Bovine Enterichek and mrtPCR were 0.095 (BCV-1), 0.521 (RV-A), 0.823 (E. coli K99( + )), and 0.840 (C. parvum). In comparison to mrtPCR, the diagnostic sensitivity of Bovine Enterichek was 60.0%, 42.3%, 71.4%, and 81.5%, and the diagnostic specificity was 51.4%, 100%, 100%, and 98.6% for BCV-1, RV-A, E. coli K99( + ), and C. parvum, respectively. The current study suggested that Bovine Enterichek can be a rapid test tool in the field for detection of RV-A, C. parvum, or E. coli K99(+) in feces from calves at acute stage of clinical disease. However, test results for BCV-1 by the kit should be interpreted with caution due to low specificity and sensitivity of the kit.","Cho, Yong-Il; Sun, Dong; Cooper, Vickie; Dewell, Grant; Schwartz, Kent; Yoon, Kyoung-Jin","Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",533,27

The major species barriers between humans and civets for SARS-CoV infections are the specific interactions between a defined receptor-binding domain (RBD) on a viral spike protein and its host receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). In this study a chimeric ACE2 bearing the critical N-terminal helix from civet and the remaining peptidase domain from human was constructed, and it was shown that this construct has the same receptor activity as civet ACE2. In addition, crystal structures of the chimeric ACE2 complexed with RBDs from various human and civet SARS-CoV strains were determined. These structures, combined with a previously determined structure of human ACE2 complexed with the RBD from a human SARS-CoV strain, have revealed a structural basis for understanding the major species barriers between humans and civets for SARS-CoV infections. They show that the major species barriers are determined by interactions between four ACE2 residues (residues 31, 35, 38, and 353) and two RBD residues (residues 479 and 487), that early civet SARS-CoV isolates were prevented from infecting human cells due to imbalanced salt bridges at the hydrophobic virus/receptor interface, and that SARS-CoV has evolved to gain sustained infectivity for human cells by eliminating unfavorable free charges at the interface through stepwise mutations at positions 479 and 487. These results enhance our understanding of host adaptations and cross-species infections of SARS-CoV and other emerging animal viruses.","Li, Fang",Journal of virology,533,25

More than 20% of the affected patients cannot be offered radical resection because of comorbidity alone. The lung is also the second most common site of distant metastases of extrathoracic tumors; it is the only site of such metastases in 20% of cases. In recent years, image-guided thermoablation has been used with increasing frequency in patients who are unable to undergo surgery for medical reasons. METHODS The PubMed database was selectively searched for publications on the indications, complications, and results of the thermoablative techniques currently in clinical use, with special attention to radiofrequency ablation (RFA). RESULTS There is only a small evidence base to date concerning the treatment of malignant lung tumors with thermoablation. Retrospective and prospective case series have been published, but no randomized controlled trials have yet been conducted. RFA, the most common technique, involves the image-guided percutaneous placement of one or more probes in the tumor, to which thermal energy is then applied. For peripherally located tumors that measure less than 3 cm in diameter, local control of tumor growth can be achieved in about 90% of cases. The long-term results that are now available from smaller series provisionally indicate 5-year survival rates of 20% to 61%. The most common complication is pneumothorax requiring drainage, which occurs in about 10% of cases. In the intermediate term, thermoablation does not cause any clinically relevant loss of pulmonary function. CONCLUSION Image-guided thermoablation cannot now be considered an alternative to surgery for the treatment of malignant lung tumors with curative intent. It does, however, widen the spectrum of therapeutic options for patients who are medically unable to undergo a surgical procedure.","Schneider, Thomas; Heussel, Claus Peter; Herth, Felix J F; Dienemann, Hendrik",Deutsches Arzteblatt international,533,1

This study tested the hypothesis that in humans, the 'presumed effect-site concentration' (taken as the mid-point between the arterial and superior jugular venous concentrations) of inhaled anaesthetic falls during one-lung (vs two-lung) ventilation. Four patients scheduled for elective prostatectomy (two-lung ventilation) and four patients for elective thoracotomy (one-lung ventilation) were randomly selected and assigned to receive sevoflurane (vaporiser-dial setting, 1.5%). Sevoflurane concentrations were measured periodically from radial artery and superior jugular vein (via a catheter advanced cephalad from the jugular vein). During one-lung ventilation, the end-expiratory sevoflurane concentration was stable at ∼1.3% but the mean (SD) presumed effect-site concentration declined initially from 58 (6.7) to 43 (4.7) μg.ml(-1) (p=0.011) before slowly recovering.

METHODS A project to assess the accuracy of birth and death monitoring by local community-based monitors was undertaken with a partner health agency in areas (pop. 94,000) where they supported medical facilities. Thirty clusters of 30 households each were selected at random, probability proportional to size. Half of those households were enrolled for a monthly visitation surveillance process. To gain insights into the effects of the agency's services, an additional 240 households were selected at random and interviewed from 8 nearby ""matched villages"" not serviced by any NGO as a comparison sample. RESULTS The 896 households with 4243 living residents within the NGO service area were interviewed about household births and deaths within the past 8 months. They reported an annualized birth rate of 5.6% (95% CI: 4.5-6.7) with only 3% of those births occurring at home. The reported death rate was 4.2/1000/month (95% CI: 3.3-5.0). In the ""matched villages,"" the population reported a similar birth and death rate, but they reported 29% of births occurring within the home. The monthly surveillance data found over the year that followed that 32% of births occurred at the home. Clinic and hospital birth attendance data suggested an attended annual birth rate of only 2.8%, consistent with the surveillance data implication that a huge fraction of births occur at home. CONCLUSION It is believed that because the baseline interviews occurred with a stranger, this induced interviewees to say what they thought the interviewers wanted to hear. This calls into question the validity of household surveys when agencies have a known agenda or position, and highlights the need for external validation or triangulation of survey findings.","Wol, Philippe; Kay, Christina; Roberts, Leslie",Conflict and health,533,16

For aquatic viruses, the mechanisms used to escape the hosts IFN system are still unclear. In this study, we show that the N protein of spring viremia of carp virus (SVCV) inhibits zebrafish IFNφ1 production by degrading the mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS). First, the upregulation of IFNφ1 promoter activity stimulated by polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid, retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) or MAVS was suppressed by the SVCV infection. However, the upregulation by the downstream factor of the RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway, TANK-binding kinase 1, was not affected. Notably, at the protein level, MAVS decreased remarkably when cells were infected with SVCV. Second, consistent with the result of the SVCV infection, overexpression of the N protein of SVCV blocked the IFNφ1 transcription activated by MAVS and downregulated MAVS expression at the protein level but not at the mRNA level. Further analysis demonstrated that the N protein targeted MAVS for K48-linked ubiquitination, which promoted the degradation of MAVS. These data indicated that fish MAVS could be degraded by the N protein of SVCV through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. To our knowledge, this is the first article of a fish RIG-I-like receptor pathway interfered by an aquatic virus in an ubiquitin-proteasome manner, suggesting that immune evasion of a virus also exists in lower vertebrates.","Lu, Long-Feng; Li, Shun; Lu, Xiao-Bing; LaPatra, Scott E; Zhang, Nu; Zhang, Xu-Jie; Chen, Dan-Dan; Nie, Pin; Zhang, Yong-An",Journal of immunology,533,7

This study aimed to explore the prevalence of posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) among HCWs during the COVID-19 epidemic and investigate the associations among negative coping, fatigue and PTSS. A total of 507 HCWs from Anhui province enrolled in the study and completed the cross-sectional survey including demographic data, Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire (SCSQ), 14-item Fatigue Scale (FS-14), and PTSD Checklist-civilian Version (PCL-C). Univariate linear regression, Pearson correlation and Mackinnon's four-step procedure were performed in the statistical analysis. Results indicated that the prevalence of PTSS among HCWs during the pandemic was 24%. Univariate linear regression showed HCWs aged 31-40 years exhibited significantly higher scores of PTSS than those aged 51-60 (β = 0.20, 95% CI: 0.59 to 9.41). Having at least one child was associated with a higher risk of developing PTSS (β = 0.01, 95% CI: 0.36 to 5.45). Negative coping and fatigue were positively correlated with all three PTSS (all P < 0.001), including re-experiencing, avoidance and hyper-arousal. Fatigue has mediated the association between negative coping and PTSS among HCWs during the pandemic (ab = 0.09, SE = 0.03, bootstrap 95% CI: 0.04 to 0.14). A considerable proportion of HCWs was traumatized during the COVID-19 outbreak. Hence, the institutions should screen out and pay close attention to HCWs who tend to use negative coping (e.g., withdrawal thinking, distraction and blaming others) and arrange work scientifically to avoid overfatigue and PTSS amid the public health crisis.","Hou, Tianya; Yin, Qianlan; Cai, Wenpeng; Song, Xiangrui; Deng, Wenxi; Zhang, Jianguo; Deng, Guanghui","Psychology, health & medicine",533,7

The 1957 influenza pandemic was initiated by an H2N2 influenza virus. This H2N2 influenza virus was the result of a reassortment event between a circulating H2N2 avian virus and the seasonal H1N1 viruses in humans. Previously, our group has demonstrated the effectiveness of HA antigens derived using computationally optimized broadly reactive antigen (COBRA) methodology against H1N1, H3N2, and H5N1 viruses. Using the COBRA methodology, H2 HA COBRA antigens were designed using sequences from H2N2 viruses isolated from humans in the 1950s and 1960s, as well as, H2Nx viruses isolated from avian and mammalian species between the 1950s and 2016. In this manuscript, the effectiveness of H2 COBRA HA antigens (Z1, Z3, Z5, and Z7) were evaluated in DBA/2J mice and compared to wild-type H2 HA antigens. The COBRA HA vaccines elicited neutralizing antibodies to the majority of viruses in our H2 HA panel and across all three clades as measured by HAI and neutralization assays. Comparatively, several wild-type HA vaccines elicited antibodies against a majority of the viruses in the H2 HA panel. DBA/2J mice vaccinated with COBRA vaccines showed increase survival for all three viral challenges as compared to the wild-type H2 vaccines. In particular, the Z1 COBRA is a promising candidate for future work towards a pandemic H2 influenza vaccine.IMPORTANCE H2N2 influenza has caused at least one pandemic in the past. Given that individuals born after 1968 have not been exposed to H2N2 influenza viruses, a future pandemic caused by H2 influenza is likely. An effective H2 influenza vaccine would need to elicit broadly cross-reactive antibodies to multiple H2 influenza viruses. Choosing a wild-type virus to create a vaccine may elicit a narrow immune response and not protect against multiple H2 influenza viruses. COBRA H2 HA vaccines were developed and evaluated in mice along with wild-type H2 HA vaccines. Multiple COBRA H2 HA vaccines protected mice from all three viral challenges and produced broadly cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies to H2 influenza viruses.","Reneer, Z Beau; Jamieson, Parker J; Skarlupka, Amanda L; Huang, Ying; Ross, Ted M",Journal of virology,533,31

In this study, we leached chemicals from plastic into artificial sea water during simulated UV-induced weathering. We tested largely additive-free pre-production polyethylene, polyethylene terephthalate, polypropylene and polystyrene and two types of plastic obtained from electronic equipment as positive controls. Leachates were concentrated by solid-phase extraction and dosed into cell-based bioassays that cover i) cytotoxicity; ii) activation of metabolic enzymes via binding to the arylhydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPARγ); iii) specific, receptor-mediated effects (estrogenicity, ER); and iv) adaptive response to oxidative stress (AREc32). LC-HRMS analysis was used to identify possible chain-scission products of polymer degradation, which were then tested in AREc32 and PPARγ. Explicit activation of all assays by the positive controls provided proof-of-concept of the experimental setup to demonstrate effects of chemicals liberated during weathering. All plastic leachates activated the oxidative stress response, in most cases with increased induction by UV-treated samples compared to dark controls. For PPARγ, polyethylene-specific effects were partially explained by the detected dicarboxylic acids. Since the pre-production plastic showed low effects often in the range of the blanks future studies should investigate implications of weathering on end consumer products containing additives.","Rummel, Christoph D; Escher, Beate I; Sandblom, Oskar; Plassmann, Merle M; Arp, Hans Peter H; MacLeod, Matthew; Jahnke, Annika",Environmental science & technology,533,16

Staple line leak and bleeding are the most dangerous complications of LSG. Staple line reinforcement (SLR) by oversewing the staple line was suggested to reduce the incidence of leak and bleeding. We designed a randomized controlled prospective study to investigate the value of SLR by invaginating the whole staple line using unidirectional absorbable 3/0 V-Loc 180 sutures (Covidien, Mansfield, MA, USA) to no SLR in LSG. PATIENTS AND METHODS Nine hundred and twenty patients undergoing LSG between March 2016 and March 2017 were included in the study; they were prospectively randomized into two groups: A and B, each of 460 patients. In group A, the entire staple line was invaginated with continuous seromuscular suturing using 3/0 V-Loc 180 suture (Covidien, Mansfield, MA, USA), and in group B, no reinforcement was done. The patients were selected according to National Institute of Health (NIH) guidelines. All procedures were performed by the same team of experienced bariatric surgeons. Patients were followed up for 6 weeks after surgery for occurrence of complications. RESULTS The two groups were matched considering the demographic data. Operative time was significantly longer in group A (P = 0.001), with mean operative time in group A was 69 min, while that in Group B was 50.8 min. Leak occurred in eight cases (1.7%) in group B and none (0%) in group A; leak was significantly lower in group A (P = 0.008). Bleeding occurred in two patients (0.4%) in group A and in seven (1.5%) in group B (P = 0.178), with no statistically significant difference between both groups as regards bleeding. CONCLUSION Comparing SLR by invaginating the whole staple line using unidirectional absorbable 3/0 V-Loc 180 sutures (Covidien, Mansfield, MA, USA) to no SLR in a relatively large cohort of patients undergoing LSG, in a randomized controlled prospective study, has proved statistically significant value for SLR by invaginating sutures.","Hany, Mohamed; Ibrahim, Mohammed",Obesity surgery,533,24

METHODS A multicenter open-label study was conducted during the 2017-2018 influenza season to assess the safety, pharmacokinetics and clinical/virologic outcomes of single, oral, weight-based doses of baloxavir granules in Japanese children infected with influenza virus. The primary clinical endpoint was the time to illness alleviation of influenza. RESULTS All 33 enrolled children completed the study and received baloxavir (1 mg/kg for 12 children weighing <10 kg, 10 mg for 21 children weighing 10 to <20 kg). Detected viruses were influenza B (36.4%), A(H1N1)pdm09 (33.3%) and A(H3N2) (27.3%). Adverse events (AEs) were reported in 54.5% of children. No deaths, serious AEs or AEs leading to discontinuation were reported. The mean (SD) plasma concentrations of baloxavir acid at 24 hours post-dose were 72.8 (24.0) and 51.3 (19.3) ng/mL in the 1-mg/kg and 10-mg dose groups, respectively. The median time to illness alleviation (95% confidence interval) was 45.3 (28.5-64.1) hours. A >4-log decrease in infectious viral titer occurred on day 2 and a temporary 2-log increase on day 4. Polymerase acidic protein/I38T/M-substituted viruses were detected in 5 children infected with influenza A, but none with influenza B. CONCLUSIONS Baloxavir granules and the weight-based dose regimen were considered to be well tolerated in children, with rapid influenza virus reduction and associated symptom alleviation. Evidence of baloxavir activity against influenza B was observed, but further data are required for confirmation.","Yokoyama, Takato; Sakaguchi, Hiroki; Ishibashi, Toru; Shishido, Takao; Piedra, Pedro A; Sato, Chisako; Tsuchiya, Kenji; Uehara, Takeki",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,533,1

Studies were mostly triggered by simple clinical observations including futility of electrical cardioversion in persistent AF; many patients with permanent AF tolerating day-after-day 'uncontrolled' resting heart rates of up till 110 beats/min; patients being threatened more by vascular risks than AF itself; and insufficient guideline-based treatments for AF. Also the observation that recent-onset atrial fibrillation generally converts spontaneously, obviating cardioversion, triggered one of the studies. The RACE trials shifted a number of paradigms and by that could change the AF guidelines.

Results 620 eligible patients were included in this study. The pathway overall performed well with significant reduction in patients needing CS. US had sensitivity of 50% which improved further to ~56% in CS naive patients although median duration of CS use was 2 days. US specificity was >96%, and we were able to avoid using CS completely in 451 patients (73%). CS negatively impacted on utility of US with US more likely to be false negative. Conclusions This novel pathway demonstrates the ability to minimise use of CS through fast track multidisciplinary assessment. US was performed promptly and had reassuring real life sensitivity and specificity in this cohort. CS naive patients showed significantly higher sensitivity for US despite the short duration of CS use.","Pinnell, J.; Mehta, P.; Tiivas, C.; Dubey, S.",,533,33

The epidemic evolution in India is complex due to regional inhomogeneities and the spread of several coronavirus mutants. In this study, we characterize the virus spread in the ongoing second wave in India and its states until 19 April 2021, and also examine the dynamic evolution of the epidemic from the beginning of the outbreak. Variations in the effective reproduction number (Rt) are taken as quantifiable measures of virus transmissibility. Rt value for every state, including those with large rural populations, is greater than the self-sustaining threshold of 1. An exponential fit on recent data also shows that the infection rate is much higher than in the first wave. Subsequently, characteristics of COVID-19 spread are analysed region-wise, by estimating test positivity rates (TPRs) and case fatality rates (CFRs). Very high TPR values for several states present an alarming situation. CFR values are lower than those in the first wave, but are recently showing signs of increase as the healthcare system is being over-stretched with the surge in infections. Preliminary estimates with a classical epidemiological model suggest that the peak for the second wave could occur around mid-May 2021, with daily count exceeding 0.4 million. The study strongly suggests that an effective administrative intervention is needed to arrest the rapid growth of the epidemic.

We performed a meta-analysis of published trials assessing the effectiveness and adverse events (AE) of MSC cell therapy in individuals hospitalized for COVID-19. Systematic searches were performed in multiple databases through April 8th, 2021. Reports in all languages including randomized clinical trials (RCTs), comparative observational studies, and case series/case reports were included. Random effects model was used to pool outcomes from RCTs and comparative observational studies. Outcome measures included all-cause mortality, serious adverse events (SAEs), AEs, pulmonary function, laboratory and imaging findings. A total of 413 patients were identified from 25 studies, which included 8 controlled trials (3 RCTs), 5 comparative observational studies, (n=300) and 17 case-series/case reports (n=113). The patients age was 60.5 years (mean), 33.7% were women. When compared with the control group, MSC cell therapy was associated with reduction in all-cause mortality (RR=0.31, 95% CI: 0.12 to 0.75, I2=0.0%; 3 RCTs and 5 comparative observational studies, 300 patients), reduction in SAEs (IRR=0.36, 95% CI: 0.14 to 0.90, I2=0.0%; 3 RCTs and 2 comparative studies, n=219), no significant difference in AE rate. A sub-group with pulmonary function studies suggested improvement in patients receiving MSC. These findings support the potential for MSC cell therapy to decrease all-cause mortality, reduce SAEs, and improve pulmonary function compared to conventional care. Large scale double-blinded, well-powered RCTs should be conducted to further explore these results.","Qu, W.; Wang, Z.; Cook, E. E.; Siddik, A. B.; Bu, G.; Allickson, J. G.; Kubrova, E.; Caplan, A.

Among these are what the DepEd provided as self-learning modules (SLMs) combined with “alternative learning delivery modalities” which include radio-based instruction (DepEd 2020). The SLMs and radiobased instruction are the most common modalities of learning, being the most accessible especially for the poor students of the country. This paper will examine the pedagogical and political dimensions of a radio-based instruction. Coming from the tradition of philosophy of technology that emphasizes the political nature of technology, I will argue how the logic of radio broadcasting predetermines a specific pedagogy and form of communication. I will further argue how this predetermined form of communication carries the danger of being an effective support for authoritarianism. © 2021 Philosophy Documentation Center.

For this reason, there is the need for a solution to increase the hydrogen density for both storage and transportation purposes. The release of hydrogen from its handling equipment is a scenario that must be assessed to define the technology feasibility. Both confined and unconfined hydrogen releases have been broadly studied in the scientific literature. However, the focus has been placed mainly on the release and dispersion of compressed gaseous hydrogen. Hydrogen distribution to the future gas refuelling stations in liquid (cryogenic) phase rather than compressed gas is one of the options to increase the truck payload. For this reason, potential liquid hydrogen (LH2) release with a consequent pool formation and gas dispersion is one of the scenarios to consider by the associated risk assessment. The aim of this study is to comprehend the hydrogen behaviour after a liquid release in a refuelling station, which represents a semi-confined space, by means of a commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) tool: the FLame ACceleration Simulator (FLACS). The LH2 pool formation as well as the dispersion of the hydrogen gas cloud in the surrounding were investigated. Different parameters such as the variation in density of the extremely cold gas and the lower flammability limit (LFL) of the gas cloud were measured. As expected, the wind speed and direction significantly affect the position and dilution of the flammable gas cloud within and outside the facility. Few solutions to prevent further consequences from the LH2 releases such as a vapour cloud explosion were proposed to spark the interest on future studies on safety barriers for this type of accident scenario.

While vaccines are in the process of being developed for protection, countries are implementing measures such as social distancing to prevent the spread of the virus. Also, there exists a need for developing mathematical models to predict the rate of spread of COVID-19 and quantify its impact on countries such as India. Towards this goal, we developed a realistic COVID-19 dataset consisting of state-wide distribution of number of cases in India from March-July 2020. Further, we conduct exploratory data analysis on the dataset to understand the states and their corresponding growth rates. This enables us to cluster states with exponential and non-exponential growth rates as well as assess the effectiveness of lockdown imposed to curb the spread of virus. Finally, we develop predictive models using Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM) on time-series data for top-10 affected states in India to predict the rate of spread and validate their accuracy. Finally, our models can be used to guide the development of mechanisms for optimal resource allocation of healthcare systems and response. © 2021, ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.","Sankaran, S.; Sunku Mohan, V.; Seshadrinath, M.; Gouda, K.

Applying this approach to $\mathcal{N}\!=\!4$ super Yang-Mills, we show how the appropriate definition of on-shell superspace coordinates leads naturally to a formulation of chiral celestial superamplitudes and a representation of the generators of the four-dimensional superconformal algebra on the celestial sphere, which by construction annihilate all tree-level celestial superamplitudes.","Brandhuber, Andreas; Brown, Graham R.; Gowdy, Joshua; Spence, Bill; Travaglini, Gabriele",,533,1

Here, we use this clustering to classify the official national SARS-CoV-2 daily infection counts and check for infection counts that are unusually anti-clustered. We adopt a one-parameter model of $\phi'_i$ infections per cluster, dividing any daily count $n_i$ into $n_i/\phi'_i$ 'clusters', for 'country' $i$. We assume that $n_i/\phi'_i$ on a given day $j$ is drawn from a Poisson distribution whose mean is robustly estimated from the four neighbouring days, and calculate the inferred Poisson probability $P'_{ij}$ of the observation. The $P'_{ij}$ values should be uniformly distributed. We find the value $\phi_i$ that minimises the Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance from a uniform distribution. We investigate the $(\phi_i, N_i)$ distribution, for total infection count $N_i$. We find that most of the daily infection count sequences are inconsistent with a Poissonian model. Most are found to be consistent with the $\phi_i$ model. The 28-, 14- and 7-day least noisy sequences for several countries are best modelled as sub-Poissonian, suggesting a distinct epidemiological family. The 28-day least noisy sequence of Algeria has a preferred model that is strongly sub-Poissonian, with $\phi_i^{28}<0.1$. TJ, TR, RU, BY, AL, AE, and NI have preferred models that are also sub-Poissonian, with $\phi_i^{28}<0.5$. A statistically significant ($P^{\tau}<0.05$) correlation was found between the lack of media freedom in a country, as represented by a high Reporters sans frontieres Press Freedom Index (PFI$^{2020}$), and the lack of statistical noise in the country's daily counts.

In this form, energy density is approximately half of that of gasoline and ten times more than batteries. Ammonia can provide effective storage of renewable energy through its existing storage and distribution network. In this article, we aimed to analyse the previous studies and the current research on the preparation of ammonia as a next-generation renewable energy carrier. The study focuses on technical advances emerging in ammonia synthesis technologies, such as photocatalysis, electrocatalysis and plasmacatalysis. Ammonia is now also strongly regarded as fuel in the transport, industrial and power sectors and is relatively more versatile in reducing CO2 emissions. Therefore, the utilisation of ammonia as a renewable energy carrier plays a significant role in reducing GHG emissions.

The lung microbiome of the youngest patient from this group was the most diverse and included Streptococcus sp., A. xylosoxidans, P. aeruginosa, M. abscessus. Another adult patient had a co-infection with Achromobacter (genogroup 3) and B. multivorans (ST891). A co-infection (A. xylosoxidans ST127/B. cenocepacia ST1772) was revealed in CF infant on the first year of life, too. Timely therapy helped to normalise the lung microbiome. Only one child was infected with epidemic A. ruhlandii ST261 dominated in the microbiome. Other children had A. ruhlandii ST263 or A. xylosoxidans as additional bacteria against the background of Prevotella sp., Granulicatella sp. or E. coli. B. cenocepacia was detected in the samples of 6 children. Epidemic ST709 was diagnosed in one child. Children from the Far East and the Volga Federal District demonstrated ST which are endemic and epidemic for these regions (ST241 and 208, respectively). Burkholderiales are detected in the samples of both children and adult CF patients. The lung microbiome monitoring is important for timely identification and eradication of Burkholderiales to prevent the chronisation of the lung infection.","Voronina, O.; Ryzhova, N.; Kunda, M.; Aksenova, E.; Lasareva, A.; Simonova, O.; Semykin, S.; Amelina, E.; Gintsburg, A.",Journal of Cystic Fibrosis,533,16

In addition to gains in simplicity, speed, and cost, new applications were included to monitor protein surface exposure and protein retention in the secretion pathway. The enhanced methodologies were applied to investigate de-novo evolution of protein-protein interaction sites. Selecting binding from a mix of 6 protein-libraries towards two targets using high stringency selection led to the isolations of single high-affinity binders to each of the targets, without the need for high complexity libraries. Conversely, low-stringency selection resulted in the creation of many solutions for weak binding, demonstrating the plasticity of weak de-novo interactions.","Zahradník, Jiří; Dey, Debabrata; Marciano, Shir; Schreiber, Gideon",bioRxiv,533,22

Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) world has addressed this challenge by means of the use of different technologies, such as Bluetooth, in order to track user inter-distance and encounter time. Technology solutions should be able to not only track contacts, but also alert users to restore social distancing. In this paper, we present IMPERSONAL framework, with the twofold aim of both (i) tracking and monitoring social distancing, and (ii) alerting users in case of gatherings. The framework is based on a sub-network of computer vision-based devices that is adopted to monitor and track users&#x2019;movements to estimate their inter-distance and compute the encounter time. Such information is then the input to an Internet of Things sub-network, aiming to retrieve the anonymous IDs of people belonging to a gathering, as well as to send alert messages to them. We assess IMPERSONAL framework by means of extensive Monte Carlo simulations and experimental results, showing its effectiveness in terms of accuracy in correctly identifying users and gatherings in videos taken from live cameras, both in case of indoor and outdoor real scenarios. The benefits of IMPERSONAL framework are expressed in terms of the ability to track people, solve gatherings and send warning messages. IEEE","Giuliano, R.; Innocenti, E.; Mazzenga, F.; Vegni, A.

Today, the question of good leadership has come under the spotlight again as a key factor shaping how successfully nations have dealt with the COVID-19 global health crisis. Amidst plummeting levels of public trust, the worst recession of the G7, and the highest death toll in Europe, the UK's pandemic leadership response has faced especially stern accusations of incompetence and culpability for what has been described as the most catastrophic science policy failure for a generation. Addressing these issues, this paper argues for the adoption of a more pluralised UK leadership approach for handling COVID-19. Particularly, it is contended that as COVID-19 is a multifaceted problem that presents many varied and distributed challenges, UK leadership should employ a differentiated range of strategic mechanisms and processes to help improve substantive understandings and decision-making, support collective resilience, and build adaptive capacities as the crisis continues. The paper accordingly identifies and elaborates thirteen strategies, drawing on lessons and insights from the risk and crisis management field, that are proposed to serve as a useful heuristic to help guide UK pandemic leadership in this endeavour. To illustrate the value and application of each strategy, examples are provided of noteworthy leadership responses to COVID-19 observed internationally thus far, as well as leadership problems that have hampered the UK's pandemic response. In conclusion, it is suggested that in as far as the conduct expected of leaders during a pandemic, or any other crisis, should maintain and be reflective of democratic values and standards of legitimacy, these strategies may also provide broadly applicable normative criteria against which leadership performance in handling COVID-19 may be judged as crisis ready.","Wardman, J.

Computerized techniques for mechanized grouping of COVID-19 on X-ray have been discovered to be promising. This paper presents an examination of the Convolutional Neural Network for the classification of COVID-19 utilizing a huge public data set of Chest X-rays gathered from COVID-19 patients and non-COVID-19 subjects. The outcomes show that utilizing various epoch counts for various optimizers such as Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), and Root Mean Square Prop (RMSProp), it was obvious that APST-Net with Adam optimizer attains the highest training, validation, and F1-score of 98.45%, 98.20%, and 98.18% respectively. As binary classification was carried out, Sigmoid was chosen as the classifier and Binary-Cross Entropy is used as the loss function. The proposed model APST-Net was compared with various pre-trained models and it was concluded that the APST-Net, which is the most profound architecture, is prodigious in terms of precision, balance among affectability and particularity, and F1 score, has accomplished superior classification results.

We used a decision tree model to compare alternatives and a simulation model to determine the household structure and provide recommendations for the most cost-effective way to isolate a COVID-19 patient in two Australian States, New South Wales (NSW) and Western Australia (WA). The results show that although the average cost of isolating a confirmed case at home is lower than that of a hotel quarantine, it is demonstrable that the decision depends on household size and the ages of household members. If the household members’ ages are old or the household size is large, the expected mean cost of home quarantine might be higher than hotel quarantine.

Recent studies highlight the need to filter information on social media into fine-grained content labels.

In this paper, we propose I-AID, a multimodel approach to automatically categorize tweets into multi-label information types and filter critical information from the enormous volume of social media data. I-AID incorporates three main components: i) a BERT-based encoder to capture the semantics of a tweet and represent as a low-dimensional vector, ii) a graph attention network (GAT) to apprehend correlations between tweets’words/entities and the corresponding information types, and iii) a Relation Network as a learnable distance metric to compute the similarity between tweets and their corresponding information types in a supervised way. We conducted several experiments on two real publicly-available datasets.

One major protective measure for individuals is to wear masks in public areas. Several regions applied a compulsory mask-wearing rule in public areas to prevent transmission of the virus. Few research studies have examined automatic face mask detection based on image analysis. In this paper, we propose a deep learning based single-shot light-weight face mask detector to meet the low computational requirements for embedded systems, as well as achieve high performance. To cope with the low feature extraction capability caused by the light-weight model, we propose two novel methods to enhance the model's feature extraction process. First, to extract rich context information and focus on crucial face mask related regions, we propose a novel residual context attention module. Second, to learn more discriminating features for faces with and without masks, we introduce a novel auxiliary task using synthesized Gaussian heat map regression. Ablation studies show that these methods can considerably boost the feature extraction ability and thus increase the final detection performance. Comparison with other models shows that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art results on two public datasets, the AIZOO and Moxa3K face mask datasets. In particular, compared with another light-weight you only look once version 3 tiny model, the mean average precision of our model is 1.7% higher on the AIZOO dataset, and 10.47% higher on the Moxa3K dataset.

Subsequently, these shifts can have dramatic effects on the evolutionary history of a lineage. In this study, we examine the consequences of changes in life history traits, in particular host-type and phoresy, within the hypermetamorphic clade of blister beetles (Meloidae). This clade exhibits a complex life cycle involving multiple metamorphoses and parasitoidism. Most tribes within the clade are bee-parasitoids, phoretic or non-phoretic, while two tribes feed on grasshopper eggs. Species richness differs greatly between bee and grasshopper specialist clades, and between phoretic and non-phoretic genera. We generated a mitogenomic phylogeny of the hypermetamorphic clade of Meloidae, including 21 newly generated complete mitogenomes. The phylogeny and estimated lineage divergence times were used to explore the association between diversification rates and changes in host specificity and phoresy, using State-Dependent Speciation and Extinction (SSE) models, while accounting for hidden factors and phylogenetic uncertainty within a Bayesian framework. The ancestor of the hypermetamorphic Meloidae was a non-phoretic bee-parasitoid, and independent transitions towards phoretic bee-parasitoidism or grasshopper specialization occurred multiple times. Bee-parasitoid lineages that are non-phoretic have significantly higher relative extinction rates and lower diversification rates than grasshopper specialists or phoretic bee-parasitoids, while no significant differences were found between the latter two strategies. This suggests that these two life strategies contributed independently to the evolutionary success of Nemognathinae and Meloinae, allowing them to escape from the evolutionary constraints imposed by their hypermetamorphic life-cycle, and that the “bee-by-crawling” strategy may be an evolutionary “dead end”. We show how SSE models can be used not only for testing diversification dependence in relation to the focal character but to identify hidden traits contributing to the diversification dynamics. The ability of blister beetles to explore new evolutionary scenarios including the development of homoplastic life strategies, are extraordinary outcomes along the evolution of a single lineage: the hypermetamorphic Meloidae.","López-Estrada, E.K.; Sanmartín, I.; Uribe, J.E.; Abalde, S.; García-París, M.",bioRxiv,533,1

This case describes the presentation of a mandibular metastatic tumour in an apparently healthy patient, initially managed as dento-alveolar infection by her general dental practitioner (GDP). Case description: A 56-year-old female attended her GDP with a small intraoral swelling buccal and lingual to the lower left incisors, canine and first premolar. Radiographic examination revealed gross caries in the lower left anterior dentition and periapical bone loss in the region. A week's course of antibiotics had no effect. The swelling increased rapidly and the involved teeth were extracted by the GDP before referral to Oral Surgery. The patient offered no history of weight loss, febrility or breathlessness. Her medical history was unremarkable. She smoked and did not consume alcohol. Histological examination revealed a poorly differentiated metastatic carcinoma. A computerized tomography scan of the neck showed a 4 cm mass in the left anterior mandible with adjacent bony destruction. There was bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy and a large right-sided upper lobe lung mass with metastasis to the contralateral upper lobe of the lung, the right adrenal gland and brain. A diagnosis of poorly differentiated non-small cell carcinoma of the lung was made, staged T4 N3 M1c. Nine weeks after her initial presentation to the GDP, the patient suffered a seizure and passed away. Conclusion: This case demonstrates an uncommon presentation of mandibular metastatic tumour as the first indicator of advanced malignant disease. The presentation of such tumours can often mimic more common, benign processes, making diagnosis challenging.

Disentangling the effectiveness of each NPI is crucial to inform response to future outbreaks. To this end, we first develop a multi-level estimation of the French COVID-19 epidemic over a period of one year. We rely on a global extended Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) mechanistic model of the infection including a dynamics over time for the transmission rate containing a Wiener process accounting for modeling error. Random effects are integrated by following an innovative population approach based on Kalman-type filter where the log-likelihood functional couples data across French regions. We then fit the estimated time-varying transmission rate using a regression model depending on NPI while accounting for the vaccination coverage, the apparition of variants of concern (VOC) and the seasonal weather conditions. We show that all NPI considered have an independent significant effect on the transmission rate. We additionally demonstrate a strong effect of weather condition, decreasing the transmission during the summer period, and also estimated an increased transmissibility of VOC.","Collin, A.; Hejblum, B.; Vignals, C.; Lehot, L.; Thiebaut, R.; Moireau, P.; Prague, M.",,533,24

Despite its utility, whole genome sequencing of pathogens has not been adopted universally and targeted sequencing of loci is common in some pathogen-specific fields. In this study we aim to highlight the utility of sequencing whole genomes of pathogens by re-analysing a well-characterised collection of Ebola virus sequences in the form of complete viral genomes (~19kb long) or the rapidly evolving glycoprotein (GP, ~2kb long) gene.

Thus, there is question of supplementation with vitamins and micronutrients, especially in reproductive-aged women planning pregnancy, due to socio-economic aspects, geographical latitude, dietary habits, and increased needs associated with the epidemiological situation. The deficiency of certain micronutrients in the diet has been found to impair the chemical, structural and regulatory processes in the body, which can negatively affect the state of the immune system. Certain associations have been identified between sufficiency of micronutrients, the severity of the course and development of complications of COVID-19. Severe course of infection is associated with severe deficiency of vitamin D (<10 ng/ml). Vitamin D contributes to changing the macrophage phenotype from pro-inflammatory Th1 to anti-inflammatory Th2, which may reduce the risk of a cytokine storm. There was a statistically significant decrease in the level of inflammatory markers, including ferritin and D-dimer, a decrease in the risks of multiple organ failure, a tendency to reduce the need for ventilation, vascular damage in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome with parenteral use of high doses of ascorbic acid. The experimental studies have shown that cations Zn2+ inhibit the activity of SARS-coronavirus RNA polymerase by reducing its replication;this fact opens up prospects for the use of Zn2+ as an antiviral agent in the treatment of COVID-19. Vitamin E and selenium have effects that reduce the risk of infection: they increase the number of T cells, enhance the responses of mitogenic lymphocytes, increase the secretion of IL-2 cytokines, and stimulate the activity of natural killer cells. The causative agent influences beta-carotene which accelerates the immune response of the body by increasing the activity of macrophages. Conclusion. The strategies for the prevention of COVID-19 provide for the intake of vitamin and mineral complexes containing vitamins D, A, E, zinc, selenium. The optimal intake of micronutrients largely determines the protection of a person from the effects of negative environmental factors including biological agents, namely microbes and viruses. © A group of authors, 2021.","Shikh, E.

In this study, we assess whether elimination of transmission has already been achieved in the region despite low-level case reporting, quantify the role of intensified interventions in transmission reduction, and predict the trajectory of gHAT in Mandoul for the next decade under a range of control scenarios. Method: We utilise human case data (2000-2019) to update a previous model of transmission of gHAT in Mandoul. We also test the updated model, which now has refined assumptions on diagnostic specificity of the current algorithm and an improved fitting method, via a data censoring approach.Results:We conclude that passive detection rates have increased due to improvements in diagnostic availability in fixed health facilities since 2015, by 2.1-fold for stage 1 detection, and by 1.5-fold for stage 2. We find that whilst the diagnostic algorithm for active screening is estimated to be highly specific (99.93%, 95% CI: 99.91-99.95%), the high screening level and limited remaining infection means that some recently reported cases might be false positives, especially the ones that were not parasitologically confirmed. We also find that the focus-wide tsetse vector reduction estimated through model fitting (99.1%, 95% CI: 96.1-99.6%) is comparable to the very high reduction previously measured by the decline in catches of tsetse from monitoring traps. In line with previous results, the model suggests that transmission was likely interrupted in 2015 as a result of intensified interventions. Conclusions: We recommend that additional confirmatory testing is performed in Mandoul in order that the endgame can be carefully monitored now that infection levels are so low. More specific measurement of cases would better inform when it is safe to stop active screening and vector control.","Rock, K. S.; Huang, C.-I.; Crump, R. E.; Bessell, P. R.; Brown, P.

The primary obstacle for the development of this technology is efficient delivery of RNAi effectors. The plant cell wall is a particularly challenging barrier to the delivery of macromolecules. Many of the transfection agents that are commonly used with animal cells produce nanocomplexes that are significantly larger than the size exclusion limit of the plant cell wall. Utilizing a class of very small nanoparticles called carbon dots, a method of delivering siRNA into the model plant Nicotiana benthamiana and tomato is described. Low-pressure spray application of these formulations with a spreading surfactant resulted in strong silencing of GFP transgenes in both species. The delivery efficacy of carbon dot formulations was also demonstrated by silencing endogenous genes that encode two sub-units of magnesium chelatase, an enzyme necessary for chlorophyll synthesis. The strong visible phenotypes observed with the carbon dot facilitated delivery were validated by measuring significant reductions in the target gene transcript and/or protein levels. Methods for the delivery of RNAi effectors into plants, such as the carbon dot formulations described here, could become valuable tools for gene silencing in plants with practical applications in plant functional genomics and agriculture.","Schwartz, Steven.

The most affected countries of the world are USA, Brazil, India, Italy, Iran, Spain, Russia, South Africa, United Kingdom and Peru. In Pakistan, the pilgrims from Iran became the major source of spread of the virus in the country, as the Government did not impose quarantine measures to restrict their movement. In Pakistan, the most affected province was Sindh followed by Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan. According to WHO, the most common symptoms are fever, dry cough, sore throat, fatigue and diarrhea and shortness of breath in severe cases. The virus attacks throat, lungs and trachea converting them to virus factories to infect more cells. It attacks not only lungs but also other vital organs of the body like kidneys and heart. It is spread from human to human through respiratory droplets or direct contact. Moreover, there have been reports of the mixed infection of coronavirus with other bacteria, fungi and viruses. Various methods are used for the detection of the virus such as nucleic acid and immunological methods but RT-PCR is considered as the most reliable. Some antiviral drugs have shown to be effective against the virus like Favilavir, Remdesivir, Chloroquine, hydroxy-chloroquine, Tocilizumab etc. but further clinical studies are required to confirm their efficacy. In Pakistan, blood plasma therapy is in high demand but involves the risk of transmission of blood borne pathogens. As Pakistan lacks medical facilities. the government has to get testing kits and primers from other countries. Only few quarantine centers are available and there is shortage of drugs, beds, trained doctors and paramedical staff. Unfortunately, no vaccine is available yet so the only management strategy is the prevention of infection by wearing masks and following social distancing.

Earlier identification of IA and prompter treatment institution have been key advancements, promoted by the constitution of Early Arthritis Clinics (EAC) and the development of more sensitive classification criteria for RA. The outbreak of new COronaVIrus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has quickly become a global health emergency and has forced a rearrangement in the management of other non-COVID-19 diseases. The impact of the lock-down of the healthcare systems on chronic inflammatory diseases such as RA is expected to be significant but is at present unknown. Objectives: To assess the effects of the lock-down imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic on the referral and clinical presentation of patients with new-onset RA. Methods: Data were retrieved from the Pavia EAC inception cohort, established in 2005 for the early identification of patients with new-onset IA. Referral criteria to the EAC include: ≥3 swollen joints (SJ) and/or <3 SJ and positive squeeze test and/or <3 SJ and morning stiffness ≥30 min. Demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients are assessed at baseline and regularly over follow-up. At 31 Dec 2020, the Pavia EAC collects information on 2.508 patients. For this study, baseline characteristics of the patients referred in the semester following the COVID-19 lock-down (Jul-Dec 2020) were compared with: (i) patients referred in the semester immediately preceding the lock-down (Jul-Dec 2019);(ii) patients referred in the semester following the publication of the 2010 RA classification criteria (Jan-Jun 2011);(iii) patients referred in the semester preceding the publication of the 2010 criteria (Jul-Dec 2009). Results: In the semester following the lock-down imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a decrease in the referral of patients with new-onset suspected IA compared with previous periods (n=71 vs n=91 in the semester before the lock-down, n=96 in the first semester of 2011, n=101 in the second semester of 2009). Furthermore, fewer of the referred patients fulfilled RA criteria at presentation (36.6% vs 44.3%, 46.5% and 42.9% in the other semesters). Among patients with RA, more were autoantibody-positive (72% vs 50%, 49.1% and 52.2%). There was a trend for increased diagnostic delay in the overall cohort of RA after the COVID-19 lock-down (Figure 1A). The delay was particularly longer in autoantibody-positive patients, returning to the values seen before the introduction of the 2010 RA criteria (Figure 1B). In contrast, the few autoantibody-negative patients were referred earlier (Figure 1C). Disease activity at presentation was significantly higher in RA patients presenting after the lock-down compared with the progressive trend for reduction observed over the previous years, irrespective of the autoantibody status (Figure 1D-F). Such increase was determined by an inversion of the trend towards lower levels of objective parameters of inflammation, such as the swollen joint count (Figure 1G-I) and acute phase reactants, and a further increase in the secular trend towards worsening of patient-derived measures, such as the tender joint count and patient global assessment (Figure 1J-L). Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic is posing unprecedented challenges in the management of patients suffering from chronic diseases. RA has returned to be diagnosed outside the window of opportunity, with a significantly higher inflammatory burden at presentation. The many benefits of early diagnosis, which have dramatically changed the outcomes of autoantibody-positive RA, are at risk of vanishing in short times. Equally important, autoantibody-negative RA is at risk of further under-diagnosis and under-treatment.","D'Onofrio, B.; De Stefano, L.; Palermo, B.

Methods: We conducted a retrospective propensity score-weighted analysis of a national cohort of US veterans with established care who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) through January 9, 2021, and who had 60 days of follow-up. The positive test date was the index date. Current outpatient PPI use up to and including the index date (primary exposure) was compared to non-use, defined as no PPI prescription fill in the 365 days prior to the index date. The primary outcome was a composite of use of mechanical ventilation or death within 60 days. Weighted logistic regression models evaluated severe COVID-19 outcomes between current PPI users vs non-users. Results: Of 97,674 Veterans with SARS-CoV-2 testing, 14,958 tested positive (6262 [41.9%] current PPI users, 8696 [58.1%] non-users) and comprised the analytic cohort.

This critical first step occurs in dynamic environments, where external forces act on the binding partners and multivalent interactions play critical roles, creating an urgent need for assays that can quantitate SARS-CoV-2 interactions with ACE2 under mechanical load and in defined geometries. Here, we introduce a tethered ligand assay that comprises the RBD and the ACE2 ectodomain joined by a flexible peptide linker. Using magnetic tweezers and atomic force spectroscopy as highly complementary single-molecule force spectroscopy techniques, we investigate the RBD:ACE2 interaction over the whole physiologically relevant force range. We combine the experimental results with steered molecular dynamics simulations and observe and assign fully consistent unbinding and unfolding events across the three techniques, enabling us to establish ACE2 unfolding as a molecular fingerprint. Measuring at forces of 2-5 pN, we quantify the force dependence and kinetics of the RBD:ACE2 bond in equilibrium. We show that the SARS-CoV-2 RBD:ACE2 interaction has higher mechanical stability, larger binding free energy, and a lower dissociation rate in comparison to SARS-CoV-1, which helps to rationalize the different infection patterns of the two viruses. By studying how free ACE2 outcompetes tethered ACE2, we show that our assay is sensitive to prevention of bond formation by external binders. We expect our results to provide a novel way to investigate the roles of mutations and blocking agents for targeted pharmaceutical intervention.","Bauer, Magnus S.; Gruber, Sophia; Hausch, Adina; Milles, Lukas F.; Nicolaus, Thomas; Schendel, Leonard C.; López Navajas, Pilar; Procko, Erik; Lietha, Daniel; Bernardi, Rafael C.; Gaub, Hermann E.; Lipfert, Jan",bioRxiv,533,1

Swift and accurate risk stratification of chest pain patients in the ED may improve patient outcomes and reduce unnecessary costs. Traditional logistic regression with stepwise variable selection has been used to build risk prediction models for ED chest pain patients. In this study, we aimed to investigate if machine learning dimensionality reduction methods can achieve superior performance than the stepwise approach in deriving risk stratification models. Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted on the data of patients >20 years old who presented to the ED of Singapore General Hospital with chest pain between September 2010 and July 2015. Variables used included demographics, medical history, laboratory findings, heart rate variability (HRV), and HRnV parameters calculated from five to six-minute electrocardiograms (ECGs). The primary outcome was 30-day major adverse cardiac events (MACE), which included death, acute myocardial infarction, and revascularization. Candidate variables identified using univariable analysis were then used to generate the stepwise logistic regression model and eight machine learning dimensionality reduction prediction models. A separate set of models was derived by excluding troponin. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and calibration analysis was used to compare model performance. Results: 795 patients were included in the analysis, of which 247 (31%) met the primary outcome of 30-day MACE. Patients with MACE were older and more likely to be male. All eight dimensionality reduction methods marginally but non-significantly outperformed stepwise variable selection; The multidimensional scaling algorithm performed the best with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.901. All HRnV-based models generated in this study outperformed several existing clinical scores in ROC analysis. Conclusions: HRnV-based models using stepwise logistic regression performed better than existing chest pain scores for predicting MACE, with only marginal improvements using machine learning dimensionality reduction. Moreover, traditional stepwise approach benefits from model transparency and interpretability; in comparison, machine learning dimensionality reduction models are black boxes, making them difficult to explain in clinical practice.","Liu, N.; Chee, M.

We reconstructed the evolutionary history of ZAR1, an atypically conserved NLR that traces its origin to early flowering plant lineages ~220 to 150 million years ago (Jurassic period). Ortholog sequence analyses revealed highly conserved features of ZAR1, including regions for pathogen effector recognition, intramolecular interactions and cell death activation. This uncovered a new conserved surface on the ZAR1 resistosome underside that is required for cell death induction. Throughout its evolution, ZAR1 acquired novel features, such as a C-terminal integration of a thioredoxin-like domain. ZAR1 duplicated into two paralog families, which underwent distinct evolutionary paths. We conclude that ZAR1 stands out among angiosperm NLRs for having experienced relatively limited gene duplication and expansion throughout its deep evolutionary history.

The annual procession, characterized by devotees pushing the carriage of the Black Nazarene, in the city of Manila attracts thousands of devotees. The 2019 procession took 21.35 h to traverse a 6.94-km route at an average speed of 0.33 km per hour. The extreme size and density of attending crowds make injuries and fatalities a common occurrence. Despite the usual risks that similar events entail, limited studies have been conducted to characterize and evaluate big crowds. This study developed methods and policies that aim to improve risk management planning for the event. Using video graphics, a static grid analysis was performed to systematically evaluate and capture actual participants' density and speed. The aggressiveness, density, and group formation of devotees at varying road widths were found to significantly influence the procession's movement throughout its duration;at least 56 pedestrians are needed to push the carriage from behind for smoother forward movement. Finally, proper allocation of human resources by local government departments involved in event management was recommended to potentially minimize the incidence of related injuries and deaths.","Diamante, Darius Joseph R.; Ruiz, Alerik Ezekiel C.; Apad, Rex Emmanuel M.; Ferrer, John Paul Aloveel C.; Fillone, Alexis M.; en,",IATSS Research,533,20

We do this in the context of three court-ordered events affecting consumers in the United Kingdom: We first study Internet Service Providers' blocking of 53 video piracy sites in 2014 and of 19 piracy sites in 2013, and we then study the blocking of a single dominant site, ""The Pirate Bay,"" in 2012. We show that blocking 53 sites in 2014 caused treated users to decrease piracy and to increase their usage of legal subscription sites between 7% and 12%. It also caused an increase in new paid subscriptions. We find similar results for the blocking of 19 piracy sites in 2013. However, blocking a single site in 2012 caused no increase in usage of legal sites but instead caused users to increase visits to other unblocked piracy sites and VPN sites. We find evidence that increased search and learning costs associated with piracy drive the effectiveness of blocking multiple sites rather than just one primary site. This suggests that to increase legal IP use when faced with a dominant piracy channel, the optimal policy response must block multiple channels of access to pirated content, a distinction that the current literature has not made clear.","Danaher, Brett Hersh Jonathan Smith Michael D.; Telang, Rahul",MIS Quarterly,533,24

To assess the use of ICS and EOCs by public health agencies during the COVID-19 response, we conducted a content analysis of online materials available from 62 health departments funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for PHEP. Bivariate associations between evidence of ICS utilization in COVID response were assessed using relative risk regression. Risk ratios ( RR ) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were reported. 58% (36 of 62) of PHEP grantees had accessible information regarding the use of ICS in COVID-19 public health response. PHEP grantees with online information about PHEP, Hospital Preparedness Program linkages, public health seats at state or jurisdictional EOCs, exercises, and ICS generally were more likely to have COVID-specific ICS information.

Survey experience and training related to P2/N95 respirators were also obtained. This was an observational study at a specialist tertiary referral centre, Melbourne, Australia, between 29 May 2020 and 5 June 2020. The primary outcome was quantitative fit test pass/fail results, with fit check reported against fit test as a 2 × 2 contingency table. The secondary outcomes were the number of adjustments needed to pass, as well as the pass rates for available sizes and types of self-selected respirators, survey data for attitudes, experience and training for P2/N95 respirators. The fit check predicts respirator seal poorly (PPV 34.1%, 95% CI 25.0–40.5). In total, 69% (40/58) of respirators failed quantitative fit testing after initial respirator application and is a clinically relevant finding (first-up failure rate for P2/N95 respirators). Only one person failed the fit test for all three respirator fit tests. There was significant variability between each of the seven types of self-selected P2/N95 respirators, although sample sizes were small. Few participants were trained in the use of P2/N95 respirators or the fit check prior to COVID-19, with a high number of participants confident in achieving a P2/95 respirator seal following a fit test. The fit check alone was not a validated method in confirming an adequate seal for P2/N95 respirators. Quantitative fit testing can facilitate education, improve the seal of P2/N95 respirators, and needs to be integrated into a comprehensive Respiratory Protection Program (RPP).","Chan, Jun Keat Yep Kah Hong Magarey Sarah Keon-Cohen Zoe Acheson Matt",COVID,533,1

This study examines the factors impacting the performance of teachers during the lockdown period of COVID-19 using various feature selection algorithms and Artificial Intelligence techniques. In this paper, we have proposed a novel multilevel feature selection for the prediction of the factors affecting the teachers’ satisfaction with online teaching and learning in COVID-19. The proposed multilevel feature selection is composed of the Fast Correlation Based Filter (FCBF), Mutual Information (MI), Relieff, and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) feature selection. The performance of the proposed feature selection approach is evaluated through the teachers’ benchmark dataset. We used a range of measures like accuracy, precision, f-measure, and recall to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach. We applied different machine learning approaches (SVM, LGBM, and ANN) with the proposed multilevel feature selection technique. The performance of the proposed approach is also compared with existing feature selection algorithms, and the results show the improvement in the performance of feature selection in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F-Measure.

However, HS models are known to take longer to build while requiring multiple expertise, which does not match the rapid impacts of COVID-19. To allow for faster means for developing such models, in this paper, we call for the establishment of a hub for rapid HS model development through global collaboration of simulation modelers.

Aim of the current analysis was to examine the impact of the input-deprived circumstances on the sexual life characteristics. An online survey carried out after a few weeks of the first nation-wide lockdown was enacted in Hungary. 1,755 persons participated in the first wave (50.4% males). Relationship and sexual life satisfaction, sexual intercourse and masturbation frequency were assessed with additional single-item questions about the subjective change (5-pont Likert scale;1=“decreased significantly”;5=“increased significantly) in these characetristics since the epidemiological restrictions had been introduced. Furthermore, several potential protective and risk factors were measured (depressive symptoms, perceived stress, loneliness, general well being, intolerance of uncertainty, sensation seeking, and COVID-19 related health anxiety). Linear regression models were calculated to assess which of the former variables predict the subjective changes of one’s sexual life. The analyses resulted in weak standardized coefficients. The subjective change in relationship satisfaction (mean 3.20, SD 0.94) and sexual satisfaction (mean 2.82, SD 0.73) were predicted positively by general well-being (β=.11–0.25, p<.01), and negatively by loneliness (β=-.14-0.19, p<0.01). Loneliness predicted negatively the subjective change in sexual intercourses (mean 2.75, SD 0.89) and masturbation frequency (mean 2.89, SD 0.84) (β=- .10–.12, p<.01), while sensation seeking had no effect (β=-.09, p<.01). The COVID-19 related health anxiety predicted negatively only the change in sexual life frequency (β=-.07, p<.05).

Treatment toxicities can impact quality of life [1], impose financial hardship and cause cancer related distress[2]. Symptom monitoring using electronic technology can facilitate early detection of complications[3], reduce symptom burden[4], cost of care[5] and improve survival[6]. Cancer treatment also increases risk of mortality from infections such as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and routine screening has been recommended[7]. METHODS We developed an application that periodically delivers toxicity questionnaires to patients during treatment. Based on NCI- PRO-CTCAE™, the questions are delivered through SMS or e-mail. Patient responses crossing prespecified thresholds trigger automated alerts on a dashboard, resulting in additional interventions as needed. Nature and time to intervention is tracked. Patient experience is measured using a Likert-scale and free-text box. Centers for Disease Control recommended COVID-19 screening questions were incorporated. Finally, a distress thermometer for cancer distress screening has been recently added. The app was offered to patients with hematological cancers in a community-based cancer center. RESULTS Since introduction in April 2020, we have enrolled 37 patients. 9 patients had chronic lymphocytic leukemia, 6 diffuse large B cell, 5 mantle cell, 4 Hodgkin's and 3 follicular lymphoma. 2 each had chronic myelogenous, multiple myeloma and Richter's syndrome. 1 each had hairy cell leukemia, acute myelogenous leukemia and T Cell lymphoma. Median age was 64 years (range 24-85). Patient experience has been favorable. On a scale of 1-5, 85.5% rated the experience as 3 or higher. Median patient engagement, calculated by dividing the number of forms completions by number of days enrolled was 34.2% (0.9-66.2 %). Symptom tracker captured 536 responses. Fatigue (153), no symptoms (152), shortness of breath (57), nausea/vomiting, diarrhea (46) and numbness/tingling (28) were the most common response categories. Of 1107 completed check ins, 75 triggered flags. There were 2 hospitalizations for neutropenic fever with the remainder managed as outpatients. Average time between patient generated response and provider intervention was 90.9 minutes. 88% follow-ups were completed within 1 business day. COVID-19 screening module captured 1096 responses. 988 were no symptoms. All positive responses (44 diarrhea, 39 cough, 23 shortness of breath and 2 fever) were false positives. Distress thermometer implemented a week before data cut-off captured 2 responses, 1 in the physical and 1 in the psychological domain. CONCLUSION We demonstrate feasibility of electronic capture of treatment toxicities and offer proof of concept that a mobile app can be used for infection screening. Additionally, the quick response time by care team indicated a high adoption rate. REFERENCES 1.

Volunteers with sub-clinical infections reported more illusions after virus challenge than they had done before, whereas uninfected volunteers and those with colds tended to report fewer illusions on the second test.

Overall, the results confirm that behavioural measures may be related to susceptibility to subsequent illness, and that viral infections may influence visual perception. They also show that the effects vary according to the nature of the infecting agent, which agrees with results from studies looking at other aspects of behaviour.","Smith, A P; Tyrrell, D A; Barrow, G I; Higgins, P G; Bull, S; Trickett, S; Wilkins, A J",Psychological medicine,533,16

The structure-based virtual screening of a chemical database containing 58,855 compounds followed by the testing of potential compounds for SARS-CoV M(pro) inhibition leads to two hit compounds. The core structures of these two hits, defined by the docking study, are used for further analogue search. Twenty-one analogues derived from these two hits exhibited IC50 values below 50 microM, with the most potent one showing 0.3 microM. Furthermore, the complex structures of two potent inhibitors with SARS-CoV M(pro) were solved by X-ray crystallography. They bind to the protein in a distinct manner compared to all published SARS-CoV M(pro) complex structures. They inhibit SARS-CoV M(pro) activity via intensive H-bond network and hydrophobic interactions, without the formation of a covalent bond. Interestingly, the most potent inhibitor induces protein conformational changes, and the inhibition mechanisms, particularly the disruption of catalytic dyad (His41 and Cys145), are elaborated.","Lu, I-Lin; Mahindroo, Neeraj; Liang, Po-Huang; Peng, Yi-Hui; Kuo, Chih-Jung; Tsai, Keng-Chang; Hsieh, Hsing-Pang; Chao, Yu-Sheng; Wu, Su-Ying",Journal of medicinal chemistry,533,10

Within the NS2-3 (p125) encoding region of both cp viruses, insertions of cellular sequences were identified which were absent in the corresponding non-cp isolates. A comparative sequence analysis revealed that within each pair the cp and non-cp viruses are almost identical. This strongly suggests that the cp BDV isolates developed from the non-cp viruses by RNA recombination between the viral genome and cellular sequences. Nonstructural protein NS3 (p80) was demonstrated after infection with both cp BDV strains. In addition, fusion proteins composed of cellular and viral sequences were identified. In contrast, expression of NS3 and the fusion proteins was not found after infection with the respective non-cp counterparts.","Becher, P; Meyers, G; Shannon, A D; Thiel, H J",Journal of virology,533,22

DIssA is a naturally occurring self-replicating DI RNA with nearly intact genes 1 and 7. DIssA interferes with most MHV-JHM-specific RNA synthesis, except for synthesis of mRNA 7, which encodes N protein; mRNA 7 synthesis is not inhibited by DIssA. Coinfection of MHV-JHM containing DIssA DI particles and an MHV-A59 RNA- temperature-sensitive mutant followed by subsequent passage of virus at the permissive temperature resulted in elimination of most of the MHV-JHM helper virus. Analysis of intracellular RNAs at the nonpermissive temperature demonstrated efficient synthesis of DIssA and mRNA 7 but not of the helper virus mRNAs. Oligonucleotide fingerprinting analysis demonstrated that the structure of mRNA 7 was MHV-JHM specific and therefore must have been synthesized from the DIssA template RNA. Sequence analysis revealed that DIssA lacks a slightly heterogeneous sequence, which is found in wild-type MHV from the 3' one-third of gene 2-1 to the 3' end of gene 6. Northern (RNA) blot analysis of intracellular RNA species and virus-specific protein analysis confirmed the sequence data. Replication and transcription of another MHV DI RNA were supported in DIssA-replicating cells. Because the products of genes 2 and 2-1 are not essential for MHV replication, we concluded that expression of gene 1 proteins and N protein was sufficient for MHV RNA replication and transcription.","Kim, K H; Makino, S",Journal of virology,533,22

How high preoperative pain scores impact the clinical course and outcomes of patients after lumbar microdiscectomy is not always clear. Here, the authors aimed to determine whether patients reporting higher preoperative pain scores have worse outcomes after lumbar microdiscectomy than those reporting lower preoperative scores. METHODS: The authors performed a retrospective review of patients with symptomatic lumbar disc herniations that had failed to improve with nonsurgical methods and who had undergone tubular lumbar microdiscectomy. Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) scores had been collected in the preoperative and postoperative period. The anatomical severity of disease was graded based on lumbar disc health (Pfirrmann classification), facet degeneration, thecal sac cross-sectional area, and disc herniation grade. Data on each patient's narcotic consumption and length of stay were collected. A Student t-test and chi-square test were used to compare patients with high preoperative pain scores (HP cohort) and those with lower preoperative scores (non-HP cohort). RESULTS: One hundred thirty-eight patients were included in this analysis. The 47 patients in the HP cohort had taken more preoperative opioids (12.0 ± 21.2 vs 3.6 ± 11.1 morphine equivalent doses, p = 0.01). However, there was no statistically significant difference in Pfirrmann classification (p > 0.15), facet grade (p > 0.11), thecal sac cross-sectional area (p = 0.45), or disc herniation grade (p = 0.39) between the HP and non-HP cohorts. The latter cohort had statistically significant higher preoperative PROMIS scores (36.5 ± 7.0 vs 29.9 ± 6.4, p < 0.001), SF-12 mental component summary scores (48.7 ± 11.5 vs 38.9 ± 16.1, p < 0.001), and SF-12 physical component summary scores (PCS; 32.4 ± 8.6 vs 27.5 ± 10.0, p = 0.005), but a lower Oswestry Disability Index (56.4 ± 22.1 vs 35.4 ± 15.5, p < 0.001). There were only two time points after microdiscectomy when the HP cohort had worse HRQOL scores: at the 2-week follow-up for SF-12 PCS scores (32.4 ± 8.6 vs 29.3 ± 7.1, p = 0.03) and the 12-week follow-up for PROMIS scores (45.2 ± 9.5 vs 39.5 ± 7.1, p = 0.01). All other postoperative HRQOL measurements were similar between the two cohorts (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: A patient's perceived severity of disease often does not correlate with the actual clinical pathology on imaging. Although patients who report high pain and have a symptomatic lumbar disc herniation may describe their pain as more extreme, they should be counseled that the outcomes of microdiscectomy are positive.","Virk, Sohrab; Vaishnav, Avani S; Mok, Jung Kee; McAnany, Steven; Iyer, Sravisht; Albert, Todd J; Gang, Catherine Himo; Qureshi, Sheeraz A",J Neurosurg Spine,533,10

Chemical fungicide for controlling soybean F. oxysporum diseases may cause environmental problems and have human health risks. Biological control methods avoid these shortcomings, however, few studies have focused on biocontrol of soybean diseases caused by F. oxysporum. Aiming at this problem, we obtained biocontrol bacteria against soybean F. oxysporum by plate confrontation method. The type of the strain with the highest biocontrol activity was identified by molecular biological methods, and then verified it biocontrol effects through greenhouse experiments. One of our isolated strain named BS06 strain had the highest activity, which was identified as Bacillus subtilis. Our study showed that BS06 strain could effectively control soybean F. oxysporum disease and significantly reduce F. oxysporum to infect soybean roots. Compared with control and carbendazim treatments, BS06 treatment had higher root biomass, plant height, leaf chlorophyll content, stem base diameter and control efficiency. Our results indicated that BS06 could effectively protect soybean root, that might BS06 strain produce substances to inhibit F. oxysporum, which was potentially useful for soybean planting.","Jia, Yujing; Huang, Jingxin; Qi, Lanlan; Zhang, Xiaole; Liu, Jianhong; Guan, Huilin; Wang, Chenjiao; Tang, Guangmei; Dou, Xiaolin; Lu, Meng",FEMS microbiol. lett,533,1

They also offer an effective solution in healthcare for bi-directional protection against air-borne diseases. Wearing and positioning the mask correctly is essential for its function. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) offer an excellent solution for face recognition and classification of correct mask wearing and positioning. In the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, such algorithms can be used at entrances to corporate buildings, airports, shopping areas, and other indoor locations, to mitigate the spread of the virus. These application scenarios impose major challenges to the underlying compute platform. The inference hardware must be cheap, small and energy efficient, while providing sufficient memory and compute power to execute accurate CNNs at a reasonably low latency. To maintain data privacy of the public, all processing must remain on the edge-device, without any communication with cloud servers. To address these challenges, we present a low-power binary neural network classifier for correct facial-mask wear and positioning. The classification task is implemented on an embedded FPGA, performing high-throughput binary operations. Classification can take place at up to ~6400 frames-per-second, easily enabling multi-camera, speed-gate settings or statistics collection in crowd settings. When deployed on a single entrance or gate, the idle power consumption is reduced to 1.6W, improving the battery-life of the device. We achieve an accuracy of up to 98% for four wearing positions of the MaskedFace-Net dataset.

Self-prescribing is common despite established guidelines that discourage this practice. From a pilot study, we know primary care physicians' (PCP) preferences, but we lack information regarding other specialties and work places. OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to examine whether physicians are satisfied with their personal primary care and how this could be improved. METHODS: We distributed an electronic survey to all physicians registered with the Israeli Medical Association. The questionnaire examined satisfaction with medical care, preferences for using formal care versus informal care, self-prescribing and barriers to using formal care. RESULTS: Two thousand three hundred and five out of 24 360 invited physicians responded. Fifty-six per cent of the respondents were satisfied with their personal primary care. Fifty-two per cent reported initiating self-treatment with a medication during the last year. Five and four per cent initiated treatment with a benzodiazepine and an antidepressant, respectively, during the last year. This was despite the fact that most physicians did not feel competent to treat themselves. Having a personal PCP was correlated with both a desire to use formal care and self-referral to formal care in practice. Regression analysis showed that the highest odds ratio (OR) for experiencing a large gap between desired and actual care were for physicians who had no personal PCP (OR = 1.92). CONCLUSIONS: Physicians frequently engage in self-treatment and in informal medical care. Whether the root cause is the health care system structure that does not meet their needs or the convenience of self-treatment is not known.","Zacay, Galia; Baron-Epel, Orna; Malatskey, Lilach; Heymann, Anthony",,533,16

Many of the repurposed drugs were chosen for their benefits to the pulmonary system, as well as immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory effects. However, these drugs have mixed effects on the heart, liver, kidney, and central nervous system. Drug treatments are critical in the fight against COVID-19, along with vaccines and public health protocols. Drug treatments are particularly needed as variants of the SARS-Cov-2 virus emerge with some mutations that could diminish the efficacy of the vaccines.

Henceforth, it gave a breakthrough for academia to venture themselves into work from home with the aid of information technology. It is known as online teaching and learning (OTL). Frequent and continuous usage of OTL to conduct lessons for learners from home may take a toll on the health aspect of academicians. Demographic factors associating with the factors related to ergonomic settings among academicians will be the focus of this study. Data was collected from private universities in Malaysia by using online platform. Association rules technique based on unsupervised approach had been used to find interesting patterns between demographics and ergonomic settings. With association rules, finding co-occurrences of demographics factors leading to the factors of ergonomic settings is the main strength of the technique. Despite many researchers in the past has done ergonomics studies in various areas/fields, only simple and descriptive statistical techniques were used. At present, there is no research work reported using the association rules technique in the educational field in the context of ergonomics. Association rules algorithms FP-Growth and Apriori were used and the evaluation metrics used in this study were support, confidence and lift. The results from this study indicated that the academic group with demographic factors (Married, Male) particularly vulnerable to the risk of mental health while the academic group (Married, Female, Years of experience is less than 10 years) did not have adequate ergonomics facilities at home and lacked a better sense of interpretation of the information provided to them by the management in the process of executing OTL. The results could facilitate further improvements to establish good working conditions for academicians to use OTL from home. The management could undertake the necessary initiatives targeting specific academic groups to address the issues facing them. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Spr, C.

COVID-19 is different only in that everyone is encountering it for the first time during this pandemic. The world has gone from complete ignorance to a blitz of details in a matter of months. The foremost challenge that the scientific community faces is to understand the growth and transmission capability of the virus. As the world grapples with the global pandemic, people are spending more time than ever before living and working in the digital milieu, and the adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is propelled to an unprecedented level especially as AI has already proven to play an important role in counteracting COVID-19. AI and Data Science are rapidly becoming important tools in clinical research, precision medicine, biomedical discovery and medical diagnostics. Machine learning (ML) and their subsets, such as deep learning, are also referred to as cognitive computing due to their foundational basis and relationship to cognition. To date, AI based techniques are helping epidemiologists in projecting the spread of virus, contact tracing, early detection, monitoring, social distancing, compiling data and training of healthcare workers. Beside AI, the use of telemedicine, mobile health or mHealth and the Internet of Things (IOT) is also emerging. These techniques have proven to be powerful tools in fighting against the pandemic because they provide strong support in pandemic prevention and control. The present study highlights applications and evaluations of these technologies, practices, and health delivery services as well as regulatory and ethical challenges regarding AI/ML-based medical products.","Dabla, P.

AIM: To explore the association between D-dimer at admission and in-hospital mortality in patients hospitalised for COVID-19, with or without symptomatic venous thromboembolism. METHODS: From 26 February to 20 April 2020, D-dimer concentration at admission and outcomes (in-hospital mortality and venous thromboembolism) of patients hospitalised for COVID-19 in medical wards were retrospectively analysed in a multicenter study in 24 French hospitals. RESULTS: Among 2878 patients enrolled in the study, 1154 (40.1%) patients had D-dimer measurement at admission. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis identified a D-dimer concentration>1128ng/mL as the best cut-off value for in-hospital mortality (area under the curve 64.9%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 60-69), with a sensitivity of 71.1% (95% CI 62-78) and a specificity of 55.6% (95% CI 52-58), which did not differ in the subgroup of patients with venous thromboembolism during hospitalisation. Among 545 (47.2%) patients with D-dimer concentration>1128ng/mL at admission, 86 (15.8%) deaths occurred during hospitalisation. After adjustment, in Cox proportional hazards and logistic regression models, D-dimer concentration>1128ng/mL at admission was also associated with a worse prognosis, with an odds ratio of 3.07 (95% CI 2.05-4.69; P<0.001) and an adjusted hazard ratio of 2.11 (95% CI 1.31-3.4; P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: D-dimer concentration>1128ng/mL is a relevant predictive factor for in-hospital mortality in patients hospitalised for COVID-19 in a medical ward, regardless of the occurrence of venous thromboembolism during hospitalisation.","Chocron, Richard; Duceau, Baptiste; Gendron, Nicolas; Ezzouhairi, Nacim; Khider, Lina; Trimaille, Antonin; Goudot, Guillaume; Weizman, Orianne; Alsac, Jean Marc; Pommier, Thibault; Bory, Olivier; Cellier, Joffrey; Philippe, Aurélien; Geneste, Laura; Ben Abdallah, Iannis; Panagides, Vassili; El Batti, Salma; Marsou, Wassima; Juvin, Philippe; Deney, Antoine; Messas, Emmanuel; Attou, Sabir; Planquette, Benjamin; Mika, Delphine; Gaussem, Pascale; Fauvel, Charles; Diehl, Jean-Luc; Pezel, Theo; Mirault, Tristan; Sutter, Willy; Sanchez, Olivier; Bonnet, Guillaume; Cohen, Ariel; Smadja, David M",Arch.

Hyperglycemia and/or diabetes are noted in approximately 30%-40% of patients admitted with COVID-19 infections. Previous studies have shown a marked increase in mortality related to increased glucose concentrations and reduction with improved glucose control. In vivo and in vitro studies reveal the mechanisms by which hyperglycemia increases virulence and how glucose control and insulin reduce it. Optimal glucose control in intensive care is limited by manual sampling of glucose and intravenous insulin adjustment, as well as increased nursing workload and the need of protective equipment. Tools for safe and effective automation of glucose control in intensive care are discussed.

At the onset of the pandemic, NHS maternity services were stripped of many of the features which support woman and family centred care. In anticipation of unknown numbers of pregnant women and maternity staff potentially sick with COVID-19, services were pared back to the minimum level considered to be required to keep women and their babies safe. The aim of this survey was to understand the impact of COVID-19 public health messaging and pandemic-related service changes on users of maternity care in the UK during the pandemic. METHODS: We conducted an online survey to explore user's experiences of COVID-19 public health messaging and 'socially-distanced' maternity care across the UK. The study population consisted of women who had experienced pregnancy after the 11th March 2020 (when the WHO declared a pandemic), whether or not they were still pregnant. We collected data between June and September 2020. We used framework analysis for the free-text data and generated descriptive statistics. FINDINGS: Women were generally happy to adopt a precautionary approach and stringently social distance in the context of a relatively unknown pathogen and in an environment of extreme anxiety and uncertainty, but were acutely aware of the negative impacts. The survey found that the widespread changes to services caused unintended negative consequences including essential clinical care being missed, confusion over advice, and distress and emotional trauma for women. COVID-19 restrictions have resulted in women feeling their antenatal and postnatal care to be inadequate and has also come at great emotional cost to users. Women reported feeling isolated and sad in the postnatal period, but also frustrated and upset by a lack of staff to help them care for their new baby. KEY CONCLUSIONS: With growing evidence of the impact of the virus on pregnant women and an increased understanding of the unintended consequences of unclear public health messaging and overly precautious services, a more nuanced, evidence-based approach to caring for women during a pandemic must be prioritised. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: All maternity services should ensure they have clear lines of communication with women to keep them updated on changing care and visiting arrangements. Services should ensure that opportunities to provide safe face-to-face care and access for birth partners and visitors are maximised.","Sanders, Julia; Blaylock, Rebecca",Midwifery,533,16

Demographic and clinical data of COVID-19 patients until June 11th, 2020 were retrieved from the State Health Secretariat of Espírito Santo, Brazil. Potential risk factors for COVID-19 hospitalization and death were analyzed by univariate and multivariable logistic regression models. A total of 10,713 COVID-19 patients were included in this study; 81.0% were younger than 60 years, 55.2% were female, 89.2% were not hospitalized, 32.9% had at least one comorbidity, and 7.7% died. The most common symptoms on admission were cough (67.7%) and fever (62.6%); 7.1% of the patients were asymptomatic. Cardiovascular diseases (23.7%) and diabetes (10.3%) were the two most common chronic diseases. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified an association of all explanatory variables, except for cough and diarrhea, with hospitalization. Older age (odds ratio [OR] = 3.95, P < 0.001) and shortness of breath (OR = 3.55, P < 0.001) were associated with increase of odds to COVID-19 death in hospitalized patients. Our study provided evidence that older age, male gender, Asian, indigenous or unknown race, comorbidities (smoking, kidney disease, obesity, pulmonary disease, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease), as well as fever and shortness of breath increased the risk of hospitalization. For death outcome in hospitalized patients, only older age and shortness of breath increased the risk.","Soares, Rita de Cássia Menezes; Mattos, Larissa Rodrigues; Raposo, Letícia Martins",Am J Trop Med Hyg,533,16

SARS-CoV-2 was found to cause the severe respiratory syndrome, and on January 22, 2020 first human-to-human transmission was reported. We aimed to reveal the complete genomes of 19 SARS-CoV-2 isolates from Denizli province and identify Turkish patients' genetic similarities. METHODOLOGY: 15 samples with the highest viral loads resulting from RT-PCR were selected for NGS analysis. Fifteen SARS-CoV-2 complete genome sequences were then subjected to phylogenetic analysis and uploaded to the GISAID database. Phylogenetic trees were constructed by the Neighbor-Joining method using MEGAX software. RESULTS: Whole-genome sequencing of the viral RNA samples revealed 32 missense, 21 synonymous, and 4 non-coding alleles. In all samples c.1-25C>T (5'UTR), c.14144C>T (ORF1ab), c.2772C>T (ORF1ab) and c.1841A>G(S) mutations were detected. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that most of the present study's genomes are in 20B clade while the two are in 20A. The phylogenetic tree constructed with all complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes of Turkey showed that the viruses were spread nearly homogenous on eastern (around Kars) and western (around Istanbul) sides. CONCLUSIONS: Here, we reported the viral genomes in Denizli comprehensively for the first time. We identified 11 rare missense mutations in the virus compared to the reference genome. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that while most of our isolates were similar to European sequences, some had different sublineages depending on their genomic variants.","Tokgun, Onur; Caliskan, Ahmet; Coskun, Cagil; Tokgun, Pervin Elvan; Akca, Hakan",J Infect Dev Ctries,533,24

An approach to stratify patients by likelihood of disease based on rapidly available emergency department (ED) clinical data would offer significant operational and clinical value. The purpose of this study was to develop and internally validate a predictive model to aid in the discrimination of patients undergoing investigation for COVID-19. METHODS: All patients greater than 18 years presenting to a single academic ED who were tested for COVID-19 during this index ED evaluation were included. Outcome was defined as the result of COVID-19 PCR testing during the index visit or any positive result within the following 7 days. Variables included chest radiograph interpretation, disease specific screening questions, and laboratory data. Three models were developed with a split-sample approach to predict outcome of the PCR test utilizing logistic regression, random forest, and gradient boosted decision-tree methods. Model discrimination was evaluated comparing AUC and point statistics at a predefined threshold. RESULTS: 1026 patients were included in the study collected between March and April 2020. Overall, there was disease prevalence of 9.6% in the population under study during this time frame. The logistic regression model was found to have an AUC of 0.89 (95% CI 0.84 - 0.94) when including four features: exposure history, temperature, WBC, and chest radiograph result. Random forest method resulted in AUC of 0.86 (95% CI 0.79 - 0.92) and gradient boosting had an AUC of 0.85 (95% CI 0.79-0.91). With a consistently held negative predictive value, the logistic regression model had a positive predictive value of 0.29 (0.2-0.39) compared to 0.2 (0.14-0.28) for random forest and 0.22 (0.15 - 0.3) for the gradient boosted method. CONCLUSION: The derived predictive models offer good discriminating capacity for COVID-19 disease and provide interpretable and usable methods for those providers caring for these patients at the important crossroads of the community and the health system. We found utilization of the logistic regression model utilizing exposure history, temperature, WBC, and Chest XR result had the greatest discriminatory capacity with the most interpretable model. Integrating a predictive model-based approach to COVID-19 testing decisions and patient care pathways and locations could add efficiency and accuracy to decrease uncertainty.","McDonald, Samuel A; Medford, Richard J; Basit, Mujeeb A; Diercks, Deborah B; Courtney, D Mark",Acad. emerg. med,533,32

This epidemiological logistics model involves the uncertainty of untested asymptomatic infections and incorporates short-term human migration. Disease transmission is also forecasted through a new formulation of transmission rates that evolve over space and time with respect to various non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as wearing masks, social distancing, and lockdown. The proposed multi-stage stochastic model overviews different scenarios on the number of asymptomatic individuals while optimizing the distribution of resources, such as ventilators, to minimize the total expected number of newly infected and deceased people. The Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) is also incorporated into the multi-stage mean-risk model to allow for a trade-off between the weighted expected loss due to the outbreak and the expected risks associated with experiencing disastrous pandemic scenarios. We apply our multi-stage mean-risk epidemics-ventilator-logistics model to the case of controlling the COVID-19 in highly-impacted counties of New York and New Jersey. We calibrate, validate, and test our model using actual infection, population, and migration data. The results indicate that short-term migration influences the transmission of the disease significantly. The optimal number of ventilators allocated to each region depends on various factors, including the number of initial infections, disease transmission rates, initial ICU capacity, the population of a geographical location, and the availability of ventilator supply. Our data-driven modeling framework can be adapted to study the disease transmission dynamics and logistics of other similar epidemics and pandemics.","Yin, Xuecheng; Buyuktahtakin, I.

Future studies are needed to better understand the involvement of the microvasculature in coronavirus neuropathology, and to test the diagnostic potential of minimally-invasive screening tools (e.g. serum biomarkers, fluorescein retinal angiography and dynamic-contrast MRI).","MacLean, M A; Kamintsky, L; Leck, E D; Friedman, A",Fluids Barriers CNS,533,16

It is necessary to gain a better understanding of nurses' experiences to develop interventions supportive of their emotional well-being. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to explore how nurses are emotionally affected working in COVID-19 acute care hospital environments. The research question is: What is the emotional experience of nurses working in COVID-19 acute care hospital environments? METHODS: We employed a narrative methodology that focused on participants' stories. Twenty registered nurses, who worked in six hospitals in the Greater Toronto Area in Canada, participated in interviews. A narrative analysis was conducted with a focus on content and form of stories. RESULTS: We identified three themes about working in COVID-19 acute care hospital environments: the emotional experience, the agency of emotions, and how emotions shape nursing and practice. CONCLUSION: In moving forth with pandemic preparations, healthcare leaders and governments need to make sure that a nurse's sacrifice is not all-encompassing. Supporting nurses' emotional well-being and resilience is necessary to counterbalance the loss and trauma nurses go through.","Lapum, Jennifer; Nguyen, Megan; Fredericks, Suzanne; Lai, Sannie; McShane, Julie",Can J Nurs Res,533,2

The aim of this study was to systematically review the assessment of risk and model the predictors of mortality in COVID-19 patients. Methods: A systematic search was conducted of PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Google Scholar, and Web of Science databases. Variables associated with hospital mortality using bivariate analysis were included as potential independent predictors associated with mortality at the p <0.05levels. Results: We included 114 studies accounting for 310,494 patients from various parts of the world. For the purpose of this analysis, we set a cutoff point of 10% for the mortality percentages. High mortality rates were defined as higher than 10% of confirmed positive cases and were given a score of two, while low mortality percentage (<10%) was assigned to the score of one. We then analyzed the associations between 72 variables and the observed mortality rates. These variables included a large range of related conditions such as demographics, signs and symptoms and related morbidities, vital signs, laboratory findings, imaging studies, underlying diseases, and the status of countries' income based on United Nation's classifications. Conclusion: Findings suggest that older age, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus conferred a significant increased risk of mortality among patients with COVID-19. In the multivariate analysis, only diabetes mellitus demonstrated an independent relationship with increased mortality. Further studies are needed to ascertain the relationship between possible risk factors with COVID-19 mortality.","Mehraeen, Esmaeil; Karimi, Amirali; Barzegary, Alireza; Vahedi, Farzin; Afsahi, Amir Masoud; Dadras, Omid; Moradmand-Badie, Banafsheh; Alinaghi, Seyed Ahmad Seyed; Jahanfar, Shayesteh",Eur J Integr Med,533,8

Lessons learned, mistakes made, and thoughts on the future of online education in nursing are discussed. METHOD: During the online transition, it was thought the flipped-classroom approach would transition well using the same design thinking methodology taught in the course. Because the course promoted rapid innovation and iteration, such a challenge served as a call to action, and the course became a valuable real-time case study. RESULTS: Based on student surveys, the overall quality of the transitioned course increased slightly compared with the previous semester's in-person course, indicating schools of nursing can innovate both the way students are taught as well as what students are taught.

The Role of Educational Neuroscience,14.003926,1.3593812,2020,"OBJECTIVE: The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), also called COVID-19, has caused a pandemic which has swiftly involved the entire world and raised great public health concerns. The scientific community is actively exploring treatments that would potentially be effective in combating COVID-19. Hydroxychloroquine has been demonstrated to limit the replication of SARS-CoV-2 virus in vitro. In malarial pandemic countries, chloroquine is widely used to treat malaria. In malarial non-pandemic nations, chloroquine is not widely used. Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine share similar chemical structures and mechanisms of action. The aim of this study was to indirectly investigate the efficacy of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19 by determining the prevalence of COVID-19 in malaria pandemic and non-pandemic nations. We sought evidence to support or refute the hypothesis that these drugs could show efficacy in the treatment of COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed in vitro studies, in vivo studies, original studies, clinical trials, and consensus reports, that were conducted to evaluate the antiviral activities of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. The studies on ""COVID-19 and its allied treatment were found from World Health Organization (WHO), ISI-Web of Science, PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Google Scholar, and clinical trial registries. The search was based on keywords: antiviral drugs, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, COVID-19, COVID-19 treatment modalities, and coronavirus. In addition, we analyzed the prevalence of COVID-19 in malaria pandemic and non-pandemic countries. The review and analyses were performed on March 28, 2020. RESULTS: For this study, we identified a total of 09 published articles: 03 clinical trials with sample size 150; 03 in vitro studies and 03 expert consensus reports. These studies were all suggestive that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine can successfully treat COVID-19 infections. We found that COVID-19 infections are highly pandemic in countries where malaria is least pandemic and are least pandemic in nations where malaria is highly pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have antiviral characteristics in vitro. The findings support the hypothesis that these drugs have efficacy in the treatment of COVID-19. People are currently using these drugs for malaria. It is reasonable, given the hypothetical benefit of these two drugs, that they are now being tested in clinical trials to assess their effectiveness to combat this global health crisis.","Meo, S A; Klonoff, D C; Akram, J",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,533,25

PrP ligands could theoretically antagonize prion formation by protecting the native protein from misfolding or by targeting it for degradation, but no validated small-molecule binders have been discovered to date. We deployed a variety of screening methods in an effort to discover binders of PrP, including 19F-observed and saturation transfer difference (STD) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF), DNA-encoded library selection, and in silico screening. A single benzimidazole compound was confirmed in concentration-response, but affinity was very weak (K d > 1 mM), and it could not be advanced further. The exceptionally low hit rate observed here suggests that PrP is a difficult target for small-molecule binders. While orthogonal binder discovery methods could yield high affinity compounds, non-small-molecule modalities may offer independent paths forward against prion disease.","Reidenbach, Andrew G; Mesleh, Michael F; Casalena, Dominick; Vallabh, Sonia M; Dahlin, Jayme L; Leed, Alison J; Chan, Alix I; Usanov, Dmitry L; Yehl, Jenna B; Lemke, Christopher T; Campbell, Arthur J; Shah, Rishi N; Shrestha, Om K; Sacher, Joshua R; Rangel, Victor L; Moroco, Jamie A; Sathappa, Murugappan; Nonato, Maria Cristina; Nguyen, Kong T; Wright, S Kirk; Liu, David R; Wagner, Florence F; Kaushik, Virendar K; Auld, Douglas S; Schreiber, Stuart L; Minikel, Eric Vallabh",J. biol. chem,533,1

There are limited data evaluating the outcome of older patients with hip fractures treated during the COVID-19 pandemic, and it has been suggested that these patients should be treated non-operatively due to high mortality risk. The aim of this study was to report the outcomes of COVID-19 infected hip fracture patients treated at a single centre. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study. Data were collected from February 2020 (after the first confirmed COVID-19 infected patient was reported in the Midlands region of the UK). All patients admitted to the hospital with femoral neck fractures were included. Patient demographics, comorbidity, COVID-19 status, and short-term clinical outcomes were obtained by review of electronic medical records. The outcomes of COVID-19 infected patients were compared with non-COVID-19 patients treated during the study period. RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients were included (mean age of 80 years), of whom 14 (48%) were tested positive for COVID-19 infection in the postoperative period. Overall, 26 patients (90%) underwent surgical treatment. COVID-19 infected patients had significantly higher Charlson comorbidity scores compared to the control group (5 vs. 4; p = 0.047). Only 5 COVID-19 infected patients (36%) required supplemental oxygen therapy in the postoperative period, and no patients required respiratory or other organ support. The 30-day mortality rate in COVID-19 patients was 14% compared to 0% in the negative controls (p = 0.22). INTERPRETATION: COVID-19 infection did not increase the mortality rate of older patients undergoing surgery for hip fractures during the pandemic. The authors recommend careful assessment of patient fitness and prompt surgical treatment. In addition, it was noted that nearly all admissions were either given large boluses of Vitamin D or were on maintenance supplementation, which may have affected the severity of the response to COVID-19 infections.","Burahee, Abdus S; Barry, Veronica E; Sutcliffe, Robert P; Mahroof, Sabreena",SICOT J,533,16

The disease affects healthy young adults and commonly has a benign course, however, if complications such as macular edema or ischemia appears, treatment should be instituted immediately to avoid poor prognosis. CASE REPORT: A 40-year old white male patient consulted for a slight decrease in the sensitivity of the visual field in his left eye (OS). Visual acuities (VA) were 20/20 in both eyes. OS fundus examination showed dilated and tortuous retinal vessels, disc edema, and retinal hemorrhages. The patient was diagnosed with papillophlebitis. OS VA decreased to 20/200 due to macular edema, and he was treated with a intravitreal dexamethasone implant. An exhaustive and interdisciplinary exploration process was performed, identifying a recent disease and recovery of Covid-19 as the only factor of inflammation and coagulation alteration. Other systemic diseases were excluded. We also describe a rapid decrease in disc and macular edema after intravitreal dexametasone injection, which could support the inflammatory hypothesis. CONCLUSION: The importance of this case lies in the possible association of papillophlebitis with the new Covid-19 disease. We believe that the inflammatory reaction and the coagulation alteration present in our patient due to Sars-Cov2 coronavirus may have acted as risk factors for the development of papillophlebitis.","Insausti-García, Alfredo; Reche-Sainz, José Alberto; Ruiz-Arranz, Celia; López Vázquez, Ángel; Ferro-Osuna, Manuel",Eur J Ophthalmol,533,25

Because simulation is considered best practice for competency-based education, emergency medicine (EM) residencies adapted and innovated to accommodate to the new pandemic normal. Our objectives were to identify the impact of the pandemic on EM residency simulation training, to identify unique simulation adaptations and innovations implemented during the pandemic, and to analyze successes and failures through existing educational frameworks to offer guidance on the use of simulation in the COVID-19 era. Methods: The Society for Academic Emergency Medicine (SAEM)'s Simulation Academy formed the SimCOVID task force to examine the impact of COVID-19 on simulation didactics. A mixed-methods approach was employed. A literature search was conducted on the subject and used to develop an exploratory survey that was distributed on the Simulation Academy Listserv. The results were subjected to thematic analysis and examined through existing educational frameworks to better understand successes and failures and then used to generate suggestions on the use of simulation in the COVID-19 era. Results: Thirty programs responded to the survey. Strategies reported included adaptations to virtual teleconferencing and small-group in situ training with a focus on procedural training and COVID-19 preparedness. Successful continuation or relaunching of simulation programs was predicated on several factors including willingness for curricular pivots through rapid iterative prototyping, embracing teleconferencing software, technical know-how, and organizational and human capacity. In specific instances the use of in situ simulation for COVID-19 preparedness established the view of simulation as a ""value add"" to the organization. Conclusions: Whereas simulation educator's responses to the COVID-19 pandemic can be better appreciated through the lens of iterative curricular prototyping, their successes and failures depended on existing expertise in technological, pedagogical, and content knowledge. That knowledge needed to exist and synergize within a system that had the human and organizational capacity to prioritize and invest in strategies to respond to the rapidly evolving crisis in a proactive manner. Going forward, administrators and educators will need to advocate for continued investment in human and organizational capacity to support simulation-based efforts for the evolving clinical and educational landscape.","Nadir, Nur-Ain; Kim, Jane; Cassara, Michael; Hrdy, Michael; Zaveri, Pavan; Wong, Ambrose H; Ray, Jessica; Strother, Christopher; Falk, Michael",AEM Educ Train,533,20

However, manual cleaning and disinfection may be insufficient to eliminate pathogens from contaminated surfaces. Ultraviolet-C (UV-C) irradiation deploying autonomous disinfection devices, i.e. robots, are increasingly advertised to complement standard decontamination procedures with concurrent reduction of time and workload. Although the principle of UV-C based disinfection is proven, little is known about the operational details of UV-C disinfection delivered by robots. To explore the impact of a UV-C disinfection robot in the clinical setting, we investigated its usability and the effectiveness as an add-on to standard environmental cleaning and disinfection. Additionally, its effect on Candida auris, a yeast pathogen resistant to antifungals and disinfectants, was studied. METHODS: After setting the parameters ""surface distance"" and ""exposure time"" for each area as given by the manufacturer, the robot moved autonomously and emitted UV-C irradiation in the waiting areas of two hospital outpatient clinics after routine cleaning and/or disinfection. To quantify the efficacy of the robotic UV-C disinfection, we obtained cultures from defined sampling sites in these areas at baseline, after manual cleaning/disinfection and after the use of the robot. Four different C. auris strains at two concentrations and either in a lag or in a stationary growth phase were placed in these areas and exposed to UV-C disinfection as well. RESULTS: The UV-C irradiation significantly reduced the microbial growth on the surfaces after manual cleaning and disinfection. C. auris growth in the lag phase was inhibited by the UV-C irradiation but not in the presence of the rim shadows. The effects on C. auris in the stationary phase were differential, but overall C. auris strains were not effectively killed by the standard UV-C disinfection cycle. Regarding usability, the robot's interface was not intuitive, requiring advanced technical knowledge or intensive training prior to its use. Additionally, the robot required interventions by the technical operator during the disinfection process, e.g. stopping due to unforeseen minor dislocation of items during the clinical service or due to moving individuals, making it a delicate high-tech device but not yet ready for the autonomous use in the clinical routine. CONCLUSIONS: Presently, the UV-C robot tested in this study is not ready to be integrated in the environmental cleaning and disinfection procedures in our hospital. The single standard disinfection UV-C irradiation cycle is not sufficient to inactivate pathogens with augmented environmental resilience, e.g. C. auris, particularly when microbial loads are high.","Astrid, Füszl; Beata, Zatorska; Julia, Ebner; Elisabeth, Presterl; Magda, Diab-Elschahawi",Antimicrob Resist Infect Control,533,24

We aim to develop a model to predict isolation length for non-severe patients. METHODS: Among 188 non-severe patients, 96 patients were enrolled as training cohort to identify factors associated with isolation length via Cox regression model and develop a nomogram. Other 92 patients formed as validation cohort to validate nomogram. Concordance index (C-index), area under the curve (AUC) and calibration curves were used to evaluated nomogram. RESULTS: Increasing absolute eosinophil count (AEC) after admission was correlated with shorter isolation length (P = 0.02). Baseline activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) > 30 s was correlated with longer isolation length (P = 0.03). A nomogram to predict isolation probability at 11-, 16- and 21-day was developed and validated. The C-indices of training and validation cohort were 0.604 and 0.682 respectively.

The available evidence to date suggests that social factors significantly influence these variations. The sociological concepts of individualism and collectivism provide a broad explanatory framework for the study of these factors. There is evidence to suggest that cross-cultural variations in collectivism may have emerged via a process of natural selection, as a protective mechanism against infectious diseases. As a test of this hypothesis, this paper examined the association between indices of individualism and collectivism and the prevalence, mortality and case fatality rates of COVID-19 across nations. Study design This study was a population-level association study based on data in the public domain and from prior publications. Methods Data on four standard measures of individualism/collectivism were obtained from the original publications. These were correlated with estimates of the nation-wide prevalence, mortality and fatality rates for COVID-19 in 94 countries, obtained from the Johns Hopkins Medical University real-time dashboard. Results Individualism was positively correlated with COVID-19 prevalence, mortality and case fatality rates;conversely, measures of collectivism were negatively correlated with these parameters. The strongest association was between scores for individualism and mortality rate, and remained significant after correcting for several potential confounders. Conclusions These findings are consistent with the prior hypothesis of a relationship between individualism-collectivism and the impact of infectious disease across populations, and have implications in terms of social strategies aimed at minimizing the impact of COVID-19.","Rajkumar, Ravi Philip",Public Health in Practice,533,23

The aim of our study was to assess admission rate for syncope leading to cardiac rhythm management (CRM) procedures in Campania, the third-most-populous region of Italy, during COVID-19 lockdown. Methods: Data were sourced from 14 referral hospitals in Campania from 10th March to 4 May 2020 (lockdown period) and during the same period in 2019. Among consecutive patients hospitalized for CRM procedures during the two observational periods, we retrospectively evaluated those admitted for arrhythmogenic syncope. Admission rate and the type of hospital admission between the two observational periods were compared. Results: Among 951 consecutive patients hospitalized for CRM procedures, 204 were admitted for arrhythmogenic syncope leading to CRM procedures. A significant increase in admission was shown in 2020 compared to 2019 (26.4% vs. 18.3%; P = 0.003). Moreover, regarding the type of admission to hospitals, attendance at the emergency department (ED) significantly increased (83.5% vs. 56.1%; P < 0.001); conversely, a significant decrease in urgent unplanned hospitalizations (6.2% vs. 35.5%; P < 0.001) was observed during COVID-19 lockdown. Conclusions: The hospitalization for arrhythmogenic syncope leading to CRM procedures increased during COVID-19 lockdown.","Russo, Vincenzo; Pafundi, Pia Clara; Rapacciuolo, Antonio; D039,; Andrea, Antonello; de Devitiis, Marcello; Volpicelli, Mario; Ruocco, Antonio; Nigro, Gerardo; Onofrio, Antonio",Expert Rev Med Devices,533,1

Despite early successes, the region is well short of meeting these targets. The overall stalled progress in the HIV response has been further undermined by rising new infections among young key populations and the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic. This paper examines the HIV situation, assesses the gaps, and analyses what it would take the region to end AIDS by 2030. Political will and commitments for ending AIDS must be reaffirmed and reinforced. Focused regional strategic direction that answers the specific regional context and guides countries to respond to their specific needs must be put in place. The region must harness the power of innovative tools and technology in both prevention and treatment. Community activism and meaningful community engagement across the spectrum of HIV response must be ensured. Punitive laws, stigma, and discrimination that deter key populations and people living with HIV from accessing health services must be effectively tackled. The people-centred public health approach must be fully integrated into national universal health coverage while ensuring domestic resources are available for community-led service delivery. The region must utilise its full potential and draw upon lessons that have been learnt to address common challenges of the HIV and COVID-19 pandemics and achieve the goal of ending AIDS by 2030, in fulfillment of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals.","Murphy, Eamonn; Shwe, Ye Yu; Bhatia, Reeta; Bakkali, Taoufik; Vannakit, Ravipa",Sex Health,533,1

Furthermore, CT imaging appearances are correlated with patients presenting with different clinical scenarios, such as early versus advanced stages, asymptomatic versus symptomatic patients, and severe versus nonsevere situations. However, its role as a screening and diagnostic tool in COVID-19 remains to be clarified. This article provides a systematic review and meta-analysis of the current literature on chest CT imaging findings with the aim of highlighting the contribution and judicious use of CT in the diagnosis of COVID-19. A search of PubMed/Medline, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, Google Scholar and Scopus was performed to identify studies reporting chest imaging findings in COVID-19. Chest imaging abnormalities associated with COVID-19 were extracted from the eligible studies and diagnostic value of CT in detecting these abnormal changes was compared between studies consisting of both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients. A random-effects model was used to perform meta-analysis for calculation of pooled mean values and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) of abnormal imaging findings. Fifty-five studies met the selection criteria and were included in the analysis. Pulmonary lesions more often involved bilateral lungs (78%, 95% CI: 45-100%) and were more likely to have a peripheral (65.35%, 95% CI: 25.93-100%) and peripheral plus central distribution (31.12%, 95% CI: 1.96-74.07%), but less likely to have a central distribution (3.57%, 95% CI: 0.99-9.80%). Ground glass opacities (GGO) (58.05%, 95% CI: 16.67-100%), consolidation (44.18%, 95% CI: 1.61-71.46%) and GGO plus consolidation (52.99%, 95% CI: 19.05-76.79%) were the most common findings reported in 94.5% (52/55) of the studies, followed by air bronchogram (42.50%, 95% CI: 7.78-80.39%), linear opacities (41.29%, 95% CI: 7.44-65.06%), crazy-paving pattern (23.57%, 95% CI: 3.13-91.67%) and interlobular septal thickening (22.91%, 95% CI: 0.90- 80.49%). CT has low specificity in differentiating pneumonia-related lung changes due to significant overlap between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients with no significant differences in most of the imaging findings between these two groups (P&gt;0.05). Furthermore, normal CT (13.31%, 95% CI: 0.74-38.36%) was reported in 26 (47.3%) studies. Despite widespread use of CT in the diagnosis of COVID-19 patients based on the current literature, CT findings are not pathognomonic as it lacks specificity in differentiating imaging appearances caused by different types of pneumonia. Further, there is a relatively high percentage of normal CT scans. Use of CT as a first-line diagnostic or screening tool in COVID-19 is not recommended.","Sun, Zhonghua; Zhang, Nan; Li, Yu; Xu, Xunhua",Quant. Imaging Med. Surg.,533,24

Despite healthcare workers banding together, physician burnout is more prevalent than ever before due to emotional, physical and mental exhaustion. Firstly, this poster aims to expose the prevalence of burnout among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Secondly, to highlight the interventions and strategies to help minimise burnout among healthcare workers.MethodI will focus on reviewing clinical trials with a particular focus on healthcare workers affected by burnout within the COVID-19 pandemic timeframe. Therefore, narrowing my search to 20 trials within the past 12 months using the following restricted search criteria: ‘burnout’, ‘covid-19’ and ‘healthcare’. Furthermore, commenting on strategies and interventions to minimise burnout by stretching my criteria to interventions trialled within the last 24 months. This is due to limited data and trial evidence for burnout strategies within the last 12 months of the COVID-19 pandemic.ResultBurnout is on the rise among healthcare workers across the globe, 47% of healthcare staff are expressing an element of burnout worldwide. With growing concerns of healthcare staff developing long term mental health implications as a result of work-related stress. At present, one third of frontline staff are experiencing depression and distress;which must be addressed. Reviewing recent trials has highlighted a number of successful strategies for approaching burnout including: app technology, talking therapy, staff support and internet-based resources. App-related technology and web resources have shown to be particularly beneficial among recent trials, with limited participation and engagement for support groups/talking therapy.ConclusionA significant rise in physician burnout and distress during COVID-19 has been noted in various trials. Interventions specifically related to burnout within COVID-19 are limited due to a low yield of completed trials;however, a couple of trials have found an improvement in COVID-19 related stress among healthcare workers using app-related technology. Internet based intervention is cheap, widely accessible and a non-judgemental method for seeking help, especially within a profession where burnout is heavily stigmatized.","Harnek, Kailey",BJPsych Open,533,16

This study presents the measures adopted by our institute with the aim of providing information that could be useful to other academic centers promoting clinical trials during the pandemic. MAIN TEXT: After an in-depth analysis of European and Italian guidelines and consultation and analysis of publications regarding the actions implemented by international no profit clinical trial promoters during the emergency, we monitored the way in which the institute managed clinical trials, verifying compliance with regulatory guidelines and clinical procedures, and evaluating screening and recruitment trends in studies. During the pandemic, our center activated a new clinical trial for the treatment of patients with COVID-19. A number of procedural changes in clinical trials were also authorized through notified amendments, in accordance with Italian Medicines Agency (AIFA) guidelines. Patient screening and enrolment was not interrupted in any site participating in multicenter interventional clinical trials on drugs. The institute provided clear indications about essential procedures to be followed, identifying those that could be postponed or carried out by telephone/teleconference. All external sites were monitored remotely, avoiding on-site visits. Although home-working was encouraged, the presence of staff in the central office was also guaranteed to ensure the continuity of promoter activities. CONCLUSIONS: Some measures adopted by IRST could also be effective outside of the COVID-19 period, e.g. numerous activities relating to clinical trial management could be performed on a home-working basis, using suitable digital technologies. In the future, electronic medical records and shared guidelines will be essential for the correct identification and management of trial risks, including the protection of the rights and privacy of subjects taking part. Promoter supervision could be increased by implementing centralized monitoring tools to guarantee data quality. Closer collaboration between promoters and local study staff is needed to optimize trial management.","Valmorri, Linda; Vertogen, Bernadette; Zingaretti, Chiara; Miserocchi, Anna; Volpi, Roberta; Clemente, Alberto; Bondi, Isabella; Valli, Irene; Rudnas, Britt; Martinelli, Giovanni; Nanni, Oriana",BMC Med Res Methodol,533,12

The University of British Columbia (UBC) MD Undergraduate Program (MDUP) is the sixth largest medical school in North America. MDUP students and faculty developed a joint response to these disruptions to address the curriculum and public health challenges that the pandemic posed. After clinical activities were suspended in March 2020, third- and fourth-year MDUP students formed a COVID-19 Medical Student Response Team (MSRT) to support frontline physicians, public health agencies, and community members affected by the pandemic. A nimble organizational structure was developed across 4 UBC campuses to ensure a rapid response to meet physician and community needs. Support from the faculty ensured the activities were safe for the public, patients, and students and facilitated the provision of curricular credit for volunteer activities meeting academic criteria. As of June 19, 2020, more than 700 medical students had signed up to participate in 68 projects. The majority of students participated in projects supporting the health care system, including performing contact tracing, staffing public COVID-19 call centers, distributing personal protective equipment, and creating educational multimedia products. Many initiatives have been integrated into the MDUP curriculum as scholarly activities or paraclinical electives for which academic credit is awarded. This was made possible by the inherent flexibility of the MDUP curriculum and a strong existing partnership between students and faculty. Through this process, medical students were able to develop fundamental leadership, advocacy, communication, and collaboration skills, essential competencies for graduating physicians. In developing a transparent, accountable, and inclusive organization, students were able to effectively meet community needs during a crisis and create a sustainable and democratic structure capable of responding to future emergencies. Open dialogue between the MSRT and the faculty allowed for collaborative problem solving and the opportunity to transform disruption into academic innovation.","Tsang, Vivian W L; Yu, Alec; Haines, Morgan J; Sagorin, Zach; Mitchell, Devon; Ching, Geoffrey; Holmes, Cheryl L; Kestler, Mary",Acad. med,533,16

Delays in access to elective surgery are not uniform in their impact on patients with different attributes. The objective of this study is to measure the change in patient's cost utility due to delayed elective cholecystectomy. METHODS: This study is based on retrospective analysis of a longitudinal sample of participants who have had elective cholecystectomy and completed the EQ-5D(3L) measuring health status preoperatively and postoperatively. Emergent cases were excluded. Patients younger than 19 years of age, unable to communicate in English or residing in a long-term care facility were ineligible. Quality-adjusted life years attributable to cholecystectomy were calculated by comparing health state utility values between the pre- and postoperative time points. The loss in quality-adjusted life years due to delayed access was calculated under four assumed scenarios regarding the length of the delay. The mean cost per quality-adjusted life years are shown for the overall sample and by sex and age categories. RESULTS: Among the 646 eligible patients, 30.1% of participants (N = 195) completed their preoperative and postoperative EQ-5D(3L). A delay of 12 months resulted in a mean loss of 6.4%, or 0.117, of the quality-adjusted life years expected without the delay. Among patients older than 70 years of age, a 12-month delay in their surgery corresponded with a 25.1% increase in the cost per quality-adjusted life years, from $10 758 to $13 463. CONCLUSIONS: There is a need to focus on minimizing loss of quality of life for patients affected by delayed surgeries. Faced with equal delayed access to elective surgery, triage may need to prioritize older patients to maximize their health over their remaining life years.","Karimuddin, Ahmer; Albanese, Carmela Melina; Crump, Trafford; Liu, Guiping; Sutherland, Jason M",Int. j. qual. health care,533,16

The Internet-of-Things (IoT) has also enjoyed widespread adoption, mostly for its ability to add ""sensing"" and ""actuation"" capabilities to existing CPS infrastructures. However, attention must be paid to the impact of IoT protocols on the dependability of CPS infrastructures. We address the issues of CPS dependability by using an epidemic model of the underlying dynamics within the CPS' IoT subsystem (CPS-IoT) and an interference-aware routing reconfiguration. These help to efficiently monitor CPS infrastructure-avoiding routing oscillation, while improving its safety. The contributions of this paper are threefold. Firstly, a CPS orchestration model is proposed that relies upon: (i) Inbound surveillance and outbound actuation to improve dependability and (ii) a novel information diffusion model that uses epidemic states and diffusion sets to produce diffusion patterns across the CPS-IoT. Secondly, the proposed CPS orchestration model is numerically analysed to show its dependability for both sensitive and non-sensitive applications. Finally, a novel interference-aware clustering protocol called ""INMP"", which enables network reconfiguration through migration of nodes across clusters, is proposed. It is then bench-marked against prominent IoT protocols to assess its impact on the dependability of the CPS.","Bagula, Antoine; Ajayi, Olasupo; Maluleke, Hloniphani",Sensors (Basel),533,23

Amyloid fibrils form above the solubility of amyloidogenic proteins or peptides upon breaking supersaturation, followed by a nucleation and elongation mechanism, which is similar to the crystallization of solutes. Many additives, including salts, detergents, and natural compounds, promote or inhibit amyloid formation. However, the underlying mechanisms of the opposing effects are unclear. We examined the effects of two polyphenols, i.e., epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and kaempferol-7-O-glycoside (KG), with high and low solubilities, respectively, on the amyloid formation of &#945;-synuclein (&#945;SN). EGCG and KG inhibited and promoted amyloid formation of &#945;SN, respectively, when monitored by thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence or transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis revealed that, although interactions of &#945;SN with soluble EGCG increased the solubility of &#945;SN, thus inhibiting amyloid formation, interactions of &#945;SN with insoluble KG reduced the solubility of &#945;SN, thereby promoting amyloid formation. Our study suggests that opposing effects of polyphenols on amyloid formation of proteins and peptides can be interpreted based on the solubility of polyphenols.

Lack of specific drug molecules or treatment strategy against this disease makes it more devastating. Thus, there is an urgent need of effective drug molecules to fight against COVID-19. The main protease (Mpro) of SARS CoV-2, a key component of this viral replication, is considered as a prime target for anti-COVID-19 drug development. In order to find potent Mpro inhibitors, we have selected eight polyphenols from green tea, as these are already known to exert antiviral activity against many RNA viruses. We have elucidated the binding affinities and binding modes between these polyphenols including a well-known Mpro inhibitor N3 (having binding affinity -7.0 kcal/mol) and Mpro using molecular docking studies. All eight polyphenols exhibit good binding affinity toward Mpro (-7.1 to -9.0 kcal/mol). However, only three polyphenols (epigallocatechin gallate, epicatechingallate and gallocatechin-3-gallate) interact strongly with one or both catalytic residues (His41 and Cys145) of Mpro. Molecular dynamics simulations (100 ns) on these three Mpro-polyphenol systems further reveal that these complexes are highly stable, experience less conformational fluctuations and share similar degree of compactness. Estimation of total number of intermolecular H-bond and MM-GBSA analysis affirm the stability of these three Mpro-polyphenol complexes. Pharmacokinetic analysis additionally suggested that these polyphenols possess favorable drug-likeness characteristics.

Early strategic planning and groundwork for evolving and established challenges are crucial to assemble resources and react in an appropriate timely manner. This article, therefore, focuses on the public perception of comparative lockdown scenario analysis and how they may affect the sustainable development goals (SDGs) and the strategic management regime of COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh socio-economically as well as the implications of the withdrawal of partial lockdown plan. Scenario-based public perceptions were collected via a purposive sampling survey method through a questionnaire. Datasets were analysed through a set of statistical techniques including classical test theory, principal component analysis, hierarchical cluster analysis, Pearson's correlation matrix and linear regression analysis. There were good associations among the lockdown scenarios and response strategies to be formulated. Scenario 1 describes how the death and infection rate will increase if the Bangladesh Government withdraws the existing partial lockdown. Scenario 2 outlines that limited people's movement will enable low-level community transmission of COVID-19 with the infection and death rate will increase slowly (r = 0.540, p < 0.01). Moreover, there will be less supply of necessities of daily use with a price hike (r = 0.680, p < 0.01). In scenario 3, full lockdown will reduce community transmission and death from COVID-19 (r = 0.545, p < 0.01). However, along with the other problems gender discrimination and gender-based violence will increase rapidly (r = 0.661, p < 0.01). Due to full lockdown, the formal and informal business, economy, and education sector will be hampered severely (R = 0.695). Subsequently, there was a strong association between the loss of livelihood and the unemployment rate which will increase due to business shutdown (p < 0.01). This will lead to the severe sufferings of poor and vulnerable communities in both urban and rural areas (p < 0.01). All these will further aggravate the humanitarian needs of the most vulnerable groups in the country in the coming months to be followed which will undoubtedly affect the Bangladesh targets to achieve the SDGs of 2030 and other development plans that need to be adjusted. From our analysis, it was apparent that maintaining partial lockdown with business and economic activities with social distancing and public health guidelines is the best strategy to maintain. However, as the government withdrew the partial lockdown, inclusive and transparent risk communication towards the public should be followed. Recovery and strengthening of the health sector, economy, industry, agriculture, and food security should be focused on under the ""new normal standard of life"" following health guidelines and social distancing. Proper response plans and strategic management are necessary for the sustainability of the nation.","Shammi, Mashura; Bodrud-Doza, Md; Islam, Abu Reza Md Towfiqul; Rahman, Md Mostafizur",Environ Dev Sustain,533,16

These two challenges should not be seen as conflicting and should be addressed simultaneously. This is particularly true as we look forward to a post-COVID recovery efforts. The solution may partially rest on the transition to sustainable and renewable energy systems. The energy transition comprises presumptions of energy efficiency, affordability, reliability, and energy independence. And in developing countries, in particular, it also entails expectations of economic development, social inclusion, and environmental sustainability. Since most of the remaining renewable energy potential lies in developing countries, these countries will play a crucial role. This paper reviews the status of the energy transition in the Global South, by surveying scientific and grey literature and synthesising the wide scope of alternatives available to accelerate and enhance the transition to renewable energy systems. The alternatives and approaches found are encapsulated in three dimensions: technology, society, and policy. A roadmap presents the potential synergies that could be established across dimensions and sectors to aid the energy transition in developing countries. Concisely, the transition can be achieved by adopting and implementing technologies already commercially-available that improve the efficiency, affordability, and reliability of energy systems, by redefining and reclaiming citizens’ participation in energy planning and policy-making, and by democratically restructuring institutions and monitoring to boost transparency, accountability, and trust.","Vanegas Cantarero, Maria Mercedes",Energy Res.

Understanding the demographic, clinical, and laboratory characteristics of these patients is important toward developing successful treatment strategies. Approach and Results: In a retrospective study design, consecutive patients without baseline comorbidities hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 were included. Patients were subdivided into &#8804;55 and >55 years of age. Predictors of in-hospital mortality or mechanical ventilation were analyzed in this patient population, as well as subgroups. Stable parameters in overall and subgroup models were used to construct a cluster model for phenotyping of patients. Of 1207 COVID-19-positive patients, 157 met the study criteria (80&#8804;55 and 77>55 years of age). Most reliable predictors of outcomes overall and in subgroups were age, initial and follow-up d-dimer, and LDH (lactate dehydrogenase) levels. Their predictive cutoff values were used to construct a cluster model that produced 3 main clusters. Cluster 1 was a low-risk cluster and was characterized by younger patients who had low thrombotic and inflammatory features. Cluster 2 was intermediate risk that also consisted of younger population that had moderate level of thrombosis, higher inflammatory cells, and inflammatory markers. Cluster 3 was a high-risk cluster that had the most aggressive thrombotic and inflammatory feature. CONCLUSIONS: In healthy patient population, COVID-19 remains significantly associated with morbidity and mortality. While age remains the most important predictor of in-hospital outcomes, thromboinflammatory interactions are also associated with worse clinical outcomes regardless of age in healthy patients.","Ronderos Botero, Diana Maria; Omar, Alaa Mabrouk Salem; Sun, Haozhe Keith; Mantri, Nikhitha; Fortuzi, Ked; Choi, Yongsub; Adrish, Muhammad; Nicu, Marin; Bella, Jonathan N; Chilimuri, Sridhar",Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol,533,20

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop and validate machine learning models based on clinical features to assess the risk of severe disease and triage for COVID-19 patients upon hospital admission. METHODS: This retrospective multicenter cohort study included patients with COVID-19 who were released from quarantine until April 30, 2020, in Korea. A total of 5628 patients were included in the training and testing cohorts to train and validate the models that predict clinical severity and the duration of hospitalization, and the clinical severity score was defined at four levels: mild, moderate, severe, and critical. RESULTS: Out of a total of 5601 patients, 4455 (79.5%), 330 (5.9%), 512 (9.1%), and 301 (5.4%) were included in the mild, moderate, severe, and critical levels, respectively. As risk factors for predicting critical patients, we selected older age, shortness of breath, a high white blood cell count, low hemoglobin levels, a low lymphocyte count, and a low platelet count. We developed 3 prediction models to classify clinical severity levels. For example, the prediction model with 6 variables yielded a predictive power of >0.93 for the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. We developed a web-based nomogram, using these models. CONCLUSIONS: Our prediction models, along with the web-based nomogram, are expected to be useful for the assessment of the onset of severe and critical illness among patients with COVID-19 and triage patients upon hospital admission.","Oh, Bumjo; Hwangbo, Suhyun; Jung, Taeyeong; Min, Kyungha; Lee, Chanhee; Apio, Catherine; Lee, Hyejin; Lee, Seungyeoun; Moon, Min Kyong; Kim, Shin-Woo; Park, Taesung",J Med Internet Res,533,26

These synergistic inequities exist in both urban and rural areas but take on a particular character and impact in areas of rural poverty. Rural areas face a diverse set of structural challenges, including inadequate public health, clinical, and other infrastructure and economic precarity, hampering the ability of communities and individuals to implement mitigation measures.

Teaching Simulation with Adaptive Learning on the Complex Doubly Structural Network,14.405697,1.19102,2020,"OBJECTIVES: The increasing availability of health information online combined with reduced access to health care providers due to the coronavirus pandemic means that more people are using the internet for health information. However, with no standardised regulation of the internet, the population is vulnerable to misinformation regarding important health information. This review aimed to evaluate the quality and readability of the online information available on emergency contraception (EC) options. STUDY DESIGN: In this descriptive study, a Google search was performed using the term 'emergency contraception options' on 13 April 2020 yielding 232 results. Seventy-one results were excluded (34 inaccessible, 37 contained no medical information). The remaining 161 results were categorised by typology and assessed for credibility (JAMA criteria and HONcode), reliability (DISCERN tool) and readability (Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level and Simple Measure of Gobbledygook). RESULTS: Of all webpages evaluated, the most common typology was governmental. Credibility of web pages was poor (average JAMA score of 1.47 out of 4). Only 10.6% of webpages were HONcode certified. The most common DISCERN category was Fair (29.81%), closely followed by Poor (27.95%) reliability. On average, readability levels were above the recommended grade level for health information. The intrauterine device was discussed least frequently (86.96%) of all the EC options. CONCLUSION: Online information was of low credibility, reliability and written above the recommended reading level. Clinicians should be aware of the poor quality of online information on EC options, and actively educate patients on what makes a source credible.","Agrawal, Simrita; Irwin, Ciara; Dhillon-Smith, Rima K",Eur J Contracept Reprod Health Care,533,20

This study aimed to evaluate anxiety, depression and sleep quality in full-time teleworkers during lockdown imposed by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and explore potential relationships between these variables, sociodemographic characteristics, quality of life and perceived productivity. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 143 full-time teleworkers. Participants were assessed for anxiety, depression and sleep quality using validated clinical instruments. RESULTS: This study found a high prevalence of poor sleep quality (74%, N = 106). Participants reported anxiety/depressive symptoms with the predominance of anxiety and very high levels of sleep impairment. Better sleep quality was associated with longer sleep duration and better job satisfaction, whereas the use of hypnotic medication and higher depression/anxiety scores seem to point a correlation with sleep impairment. Anxiety/depression positively correlated with worse sleep quality and negatively associated with quality of life. Male sex was negatively associated with perceived productivity. CONCLUSIONS: A higher prevalence of poor sleep quality was found in comparison with other studies performed during the COVID-19 pandemic as well as high levels of anxiety and depression. These results highlight the relevance of considering the potential negative impact of telework on mental health.","Afonso, Pedro; Fonseca, Miguel; Teodoro, Tomás",J. public health (Oxf),533,5

OBJECTIVE: Develop and clinically validate an adaptable, personalized diagnostic model to assist clinicians in ruling-in and ruling-out COVID-19 in potential patients. This study compares the diagnostic performance of probabilistic, graphical, and machine-learning models against a previously published benchmark model. METHODS: We integrated patient symptom and test data using machine learning and Bayesian inference to quantify individual patient risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We trained models with 100,000 simulated patient profiles based on thirteen symptoms, estimated local prevalence, imaging, and molecular diagnostic performance from published reports. We tested these models with consecutive patients who presented with a COVID-19 compatible illness at the University of California San Diego Medical Center over 14 days starting in March 2020. RESULTS: We included 55 consecutive patients with fever (78%) or cough (77%) presenting for ambulatory (n=11) or hospital care (n=44). 51% (n=28) were female, 49% were age <60. Common comorbidities included diabetes (22%), hypertension (27%), cancer (16%) and cardiovascular disease (13%). 69% of these (n=38) were RT-PCR confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection, 11 had repeated negative nucleic acid testing and an alternate diagnosis. Bayesian inference network, distance metric-learning, and ensemble models discriminated between patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and alternate diagnoses with sensitivities of 81.6 - 84.2%, specificities of 58.8 - 70.6%, and accuracies of 61.4 - 71.8%. After integrating imaging and laboratory test statistics with the predictions of the Bayesian inference network, changes in diagnostic uncertainty at each step in the simulated clinical evaluation process were highly sensitive to location, symptom, and diagnostic test choices. CONCLUSIONS: Decision support models that incorporate symptoms and available test results can help providers diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infection in real world settings.","D039,; Ambrosia, Christopher; Christensen, Henrik; Aronoff-Spencer, Eliah",J. med. internet res,533,16

METHODS: We reviewed the positivity rates for detection of common enteric pathogens from stool samples submitted to an academic medical center laboratory pre (2016-2019) and post the start of the COVID-19 pandemic (2020). RESULTS: In contrast to other enteric pathogens, norovirus positivity rates dropped dramatically from a yearly average of 3.9% in 2016-2019 to 0.76% from March 2020 through the end of 2020. CONCLUSION: A sustained reduction in norovirus positivity rates was temporally associated with COVID-19 mitigation processes in the Philadelphia area, while positivity rates for other common enteric pathogens were only intermittently reduced.","Nachamkin, Irving; Richard-Greenblatt, Melissa; Yu, Mei; Bui, Hong",Infect Dis Ther,533,33

Lung biology interfaces with inhaler performance to allow optimal delivery of therapeutic agent for disease treatment. Inhalation aerosol products consist of the therapeutic agent, formulation, and device. The manufacturing specifications on each of the components, and their combination, allow accurate and reproducible control of measures of quality and in-vitro performance. These product variables in combination with patient variables, including co-ordination skill during inhaler use, intrinsic lung biology, disease and consequent pulmonary function, contribute to drug safety and efficacy outcomes. Due to the complexity of pulmonary drug delivery, predicting biological outcomes from first principles has been challenging. Ongoing research appears to offer new insights that may allow accurate prediction of drug behavior in the lungs. Disruptive innovations were characteristic of research and development in inhaled drug delivery at the end of the last century. Although there were relatively few new inhaled products launched in the first decade of the new millennium it was evident that the earlier years of exploration resulted in maturation of commercially successful technologies. A significant increase in new and generic products has occurred in the last decade and technical, regulatory and disease management trends are emerging. Some of these developments can trace their origins to earlier periods of creativity in the field while others are a reflection of advances in other areas of basic and computer, sciences and engineering.

This meant a challenge for the care of mentally ill hospitalized patients. There was a social shut-down in Bavaria with a decrease in social contacts. The present study deals with psychiatric care provided to these patients by psychologists and psychiatrists working in the home office and in the clinic. Psychologists from the Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy at LMU Munich, together with physicians working in the clinic, established telephone-based patient care for inpatients during the acute crisis in the home office during quarantine, in which 23 patients with depressive and schizophrenic disorders participated. Psychologists then worked in the hospital with 98 hospitalized patients. Current distress and its stresses were addressed and new therapeutic components were integrated into care. The feasibility of home office, its possibilities and limitations are presented. In this study, care concepts for hospitalized patients with affective and schizophrenic disorders as well as current stress factors and psychotherapeutic concepts will be addressed. The current approach was positively evaluated by patients and physicians and is thus promising in the current situation. With the exception of patients in the acute ward, all patients and even older ones benefited from this measure. During the crisis from March to August, all psychologists worked on full-time positions with the usual treatment frequency of 1-2 sessions a week, which was especially important for elderly individuals. During the acute COVID-19 crisis, there was a pause only in the treatment of ward-wide groups and family groups. Psychologists, like physicians and nurses, had a system-relevant role to play.","Schaub, Annette; Michel, Clara; Beck, Paula; Falkai, Peter",Fortschr. Neurol. Psychiatr,533,26

Genetic diversity and evolution of SARS-CoV-2 were analyzed based on 260,673 whole-genome sequences, which were sampled from 62 countries between 24 December 2019 and 12 January 2021. We found that amino acid (AA) substitutions were observed in all SARS-CoV-2 proteins, and the top six proteins with the highest substitution rates were ORF10, nucleocapsid, ORF3a, spike glycoprotein, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and ORF8. Among 25,629 amino acid substitutions at 8484 polymorphic sites across the coding region of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, the D614G (93.88%) variant in spike and the P323L (93.74%) variant in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase were the dominant variants on six continents. As of January 2021, the genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 could be divided into at least 12 different clades. Distributions of SARS-CoV-2 clades were featured with temporal and geographical dynamics on six continents.

Using bronchoalveolar lavage fluid transcriptome data of COVID-19 patients, we found that the endocytosis and lysosome pathways are highly involved in the disease and that the regulation of genes involved in neutrophil degranulation was disrupted, suggesting an intense battle between SARS-CoV-2 and humans. Furthermore, we implemented a coexpression drug repositioning analysis, cogena, and identified two antiviral drugs (saquinavir and ribavirin) and several other candidate drugs (such as dinoprost, dipivefrine, dexamethasone and (-)-isoprenaline).

DESIGN: A descriptive literature review was performed. The search of the literature was conducted through using electronic databases including PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar and Cochrane library. SETTING: A wide range of published articles focused on child malnutrition were reviewed. PARTICIPANTS: The study was focused on children especially those under 5 years. RESULTS: The current study proposes strategic responses to reduce child undernutrition. These responses include strengthening access to community-based nutrition services that support the early detection and treatment of undernourished children and emergency food distribution, including fortified foods with vitamins and minerals, to vulnerable households, particularly those with children under 5 years. Moreover, counseling and promotion programmes should be reinforced to revitalise community nutrition education in areas such as gestation, exclusive breast-feeding and complementary feeding, and hygienic practices involving handwashing, proper sanitation and other basic behavioural changes. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected many countries especially those in the regions of South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa in which there has been an ongoing burden of child undernutrition. However, malnutrition is preventable and can be eliminated through a multisectoral strategic approach. The effective execution of a multisectoral approach towards preventing childhood malnutrition will require not only a financial investment but also the collective efforts from different ministries of the governments, UN-affiliated agencies and non-governmental organisations.","Ntambara, James; Chu, Minjie",Public Health Nutr,533,1

The grouping (OR, 2.402;95% CI, 1.040-5.546;P = 0.040), long interval (OR, 2.573;95% CI, 1.022-6.478;P = 0.045), and China liver cancer staging system (OR, 2.500;95% CI, 1.797-3.480;P &lt;0.001) were independent predictors for the efficacy of TACE treatment. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic causes a longer follow-up interval in general, which may further lead to a lower ORR in HCC patients. Those with a follow-up interval of &gt;95 days tend to have a worse prognosis.","Jin, Z. C.; Chen, L.; Zhong, B. Y.; Zhu, H. D.; Zeng, C. H.; Li, R.; Guo, J. H.; He, S. C.; Deng, G.; Zhu, X.

Previously it was estimated that there were 1.2 million YLLs associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) deaths in the USA through 11 July 2020. The aim of this study is to update YLL estimates for the first full year of the pandemic. METHODS: We employed data regarding COVID-19 deaths in the USA through 31 January 2021 by jurisdiction, gender and age group. We used actuarial life expectancy tables by gender and age to estimate YLLs. RESULTS: We estimated roughly 3.9 million YLLs due to COVID-19 deaths, which correspond to roughly 9.2 YLLs per death. We observed a large range across states in YLLs per 10 000 capita, with New York City at 298 and Vermont at 12. Nationally, the YLLs per 10 000 capita were greater for males than females (136.3 versus 102.3), but there was significant variation in the differences across states. CONCLUSIONS: Our estimates provide further insight into the mortality effects of COVID-19. The observed differences across states and genders demonstrate the need for disaggregated analyses of the pandemic's effects.","Quast, Troy; Andel, Ross; Gregory, Sean; Storch, Eric A",J. public health (Oxf),533,16

Due to this lockdown, individuals have been forced to find and use alternatives for accomplishing tasks including shopping, socializing, working, and finding information, and many have turned to the internet and their mobile devices. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to describe how South Africans consume and internalize information surrounding the COVID-19 outbreak in order to determine whether the COVID-19 lockdown and social isolation have influenced technology behavior, particularly in terms of health communication and information. METHODS: From June 24 to August 24, 2020, people in South Africa were invited to complete a survey through the Upinion mobile app, an online data collection resource. The survey collected information on demographics, and technology use during the lockdown, and COVID-19 knowledge. RESULTS: There were 405 participants, of which 296 (73.06%) were female. A total of 320 (79.01%) participants had a tertiary school education, 242 (59.75%) were single, and 173 (42.72%) had full-time employment. The lockdown forced 363 (89.63%) participants to use more technology, especially for work (n=140, 24.05%) and social media/communication (n=133, 22.85%). Security or privacy issues (n=46, 38.98%) and unfamiliarity with technology (n=32, 27.12%) were identified as the most common issues faced by the 127 (31.36%) participants who were unsure about using technology prior to the lockdown. Almost all participants (n=392, 96.79%) stated that they would continue using technology after the lockdown. Multimedia (n=215, 53.09%), mobile phone content (n=99, 24.44%), and health organizations and professionals (n=91, 22.47%) were the main sources of COVID-19 information. Most participants (n=282, 69.63%) felt that they had enough information. Two-thirds (n=275, 67.90%) of participants stated that they had used their mobile phones for health information before the lockdown, with web searches (n=109, 26.91%), social media (n=58, 14.32%), and government and institutional websites (n=52; 12.84%) serving as their main sources of information. Overall, the mean COVID-19 knowledge score was 8.8 (out of 10), and 335 (82.72%) had adequate knowledge (scored &#8805;8). Males were less likely to identify the correct transmission routes, and single participants were less likely to identify the signs and symptoms of the coronavirus. Tertiary school graduates were 4 times more likely to correctly identify the routes and 2 times more likely to identify how to stop the spread of the virus. People aged 43-56 years were 4 times more likely to identify how the coronavirus can be prevented, and participants &#8805;57 years were 2.6 times more likely to obtain a knowledge score of 10 when compared to those under 29 years of age. CONCLUSIONS: This study has shown that the COVID-19 lockdown has forced people to increase technology use, and people plan to continue using technology after the lockdown is lifted. Increased technology use was seen across a variety of fields; however, barriers including privacy, unfamiliarity, and data costs were identified. This population showed high COVID-19 knowledge, although the use of web searches and social media, instead of government and institutional websites, increases the potential for health misinformation to be spread.","Fischer, Alex Emilio; Van Tonder, Tanya; Gumede, Siphamandla B; Lalla-Edward, Samanta T",JMIR Form Res,533,20

Thus, SARS-CoV-2 is thought to have originated from bat. However, whether SARS-CoV-2 emerged from bats directly or through an intermediate host remains elusive. Here, we found that Rhinolophus affinis bat ACE2 (RaACE2) is an entry receptor for both SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13, although RaACE2 binding to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 is markedly weaker than that of hACE2. We further evaluated the receptor activities of ACE2s from additional 16 diverse animal species for RaTG13, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 in terms of S protein binding, membrane fusion, and pseudovirus entry. We found that the RaTG13 spike (S) protein is significantly less fusogenic than SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, and seven out of sixteen different ACE2s function as entry receptors for all three viruses, indicating that all three viruses might have broad host rages. Of note, RaTG13 S pseudovirions can use mouse, but not pangolin ACE2, for virus entry, whereas SARS-CoV-2 S pseudovirions can use pangolin, but limited for mouse, ACE2s enter cells. Mutagenesis analysis revealed that residues 484 and 498 in RaTG13 and SARS-CoV-2 S proteins play critical roles in recognition of mouse and human ACE2. Finally, two polymorphous Rhinolophous sinicus bat ACE2s showed different susceptibilities to virus entry by RaTG13 and SARS-CoV-2 S pseudovirions, suggesting possible coevolution. Our results offer better understanding of the mechanism of coronavirus entry, host range, and virus-host coevolution.","Li, Pei; Guo, Ruixuan; Liu, Yan; Zhang, Yintgtao; Hu, Jiaxin; Ou, Xiuyuan; Mi, Dan; Chen, Ting; Mu, Zhixia; Han, Yelin; Chen, Zihan; Cui, Zhewei; Zhang, Leiliang; Wang, Xinquan; Wu, Zhiqiang; Wang, Jianwei; Jin, Qi; Qian, Zhaohui",,533,23

It is disappointing that there are no specific drugs until now. The combination of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and western medication seems to be the current more effective treatment strategy for COVID-19 patients in China. In this review, we mainly discussed the relationship between COVID-19 and gut microbiota (GM), as well as the possible impact of TCM combined with western medication on GM in the treatment of COVID-19 patients, aiming to provide references for the possible role of GM in TCM against COVID-19. The available data suggest that GM dysbiosis did occur in COVID-19 patients, and the intervention of GM could ameliorate the clinical condition of COVID-19 patients. In addition, TCMs (e.g., Jinhua Qinggan granule, Lianhua Qingwen capsule, Qingfei Paidu decoction, Shufeng Jiedu capsule, Qingjin Jianghuo decoction, Toujie Quwen granules, and MaxingShigan) have been proven to be safe and effective for the treatment of COVID-19 in Chinese clinic. Among them, Ephedra sinica, Glycyrrhiza uralensis, Bupleurum chinense, Lonicera japonica, Scutellaria baicalensi, and Astragalus membranaceus are common herbs and have a certain regulation on GM, immunity, and angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Notably, Qingfei Paidu decoction and MaxingShigan have been demonstrated to modulate GM. Finally, the hypothesis of GM-mediated TCM treatment of COVID-19 is proposed, and more clinical trials and basic experiments need to be initiated to confirm this hypothesis.","Zhang, Qiao Yue ShiJun Wang WenXiao Chen YanYan Zhao ChongBo Song YiJun Yan Dan Zhang Li Tang YuPing",American Journal of Chinese Medicine,533,1

We cross-validated manual and automated high-throughput testing for SARS-CoV-2-RNA, evaluated SARS-CoV-2 loads in nasopharyngeal-oropharyngeal swabs (NOPS), lower respiratory fluids, and plasma, and analyzed detection rates after lockdown and relaxation measures. METHODS: Basel-S-gene, Roche-E-gene, and Roche-cobas®6800-Target1 and Target2 were prospectively validated in 1344 NOPS submitted during the first pandemic peak (Week 13). Follow-up cohort (FUP) 1, 2, and 3 comprised 10,999, 10,147, and 19,389 NOPS submitted during a 10-week period until Weeks 23, 33, and 43, respectively. RESULTS: Concordant results were obtained in 1308 cases (97%), including 97 (9%) SARS-CoV-2-positives showing high quantitative correlations (Spearman's r > .95; p < .001) for all assays and high precision by Bland-Altman analysis. Discordant samples (N = 36, 3%) had significantly lower SARS-CoV-2 loads (p < .001). Following lockdown, detection rates declined to <1% in FUP-1, reducing single-test positive predictive values from 99.3% to 85.1%. Following relaxation, rates flared up to 4% and 12% in FUP-2 and -3, but infected patients were younger than during lockdown (34 vs. 52 years, p < .001). In 261 patients providing 936 NOPS, SARS-CoV-2 loads declined by three orders of magnitude within 10 days postdiagnosis (p < .001). SARS-CoV-2 loads in NOPS correlated with those in time-matched lower respiratory fluids or in plasma but remained detectable in some cases with negative follow-up NOPS, respectively. CONCLUSION: Manual and automated assays significantly correlated qualitatively and quantitatively. Following a successful lockdown, declining positive predictive values require independent dual-target confirmation for reliable assessment. Confirmatory and quantitative follow-up testing should be obtained within <5 days and consider lower respiratory fluids in symptomatic patients with SARS-CoV-2-negative NOPS.","Leuzinger, Karoline; Gosert, Rainer; Søgaard, Kirstine K; Naegele, Klaudia; Bielicki, Julia; Roloff, Tim; Bingisser, Roland; Nickel, Christian H; Khanna, Nina; Sutter, Sarah Tschudin; Widmer, Andreas F; Rentsch, Katharina; Pargger, Hans; Siegemund, Martin; Stolz, Daiana; Tamm, Michael; Bassetti, Stefano; Osthoff, Michael; Battegay, Manuel; Egli, Adrian; Hirsch, Hans H",J Med Virol,533,23

Early detection and treatment are critical to improving outcomes. Our primary objective was to develop artificial intelligence capable of predicting sepsis earlier using a minimal set of streaming physiological data in real-time. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A total of 29,552 adult patients were admitted to the intensive care unit across five regional hospitals in Memphis, TN over 18 months from January 2017 to July 2018. From these, 5,958 patients were selected after filtering for continuous (minute-by-minute) physiological data availability. A total of 617 (10.4%) patients were identified as sepsis cases, using the Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock (Sepsis-3) criteria. Physiomarkers, a set of signal processing features, were derived from five physiological data streams including heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure (systolic, diastolic, and mean), captured every minute from the bedside monitors. A support vector machine (SVM) classifier was used for classification. The model accurately predicted sepsis up to a mean and 95% confidence interval of 17.4â±â0.22âhours before sepsis onset, with an average test accuracy of 83.0% (average sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of 0.757, 0.902, and 0.781, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that salient physiomarkers derived from continuous bedside monitoring are temporally and differentially expressed in septic patients. Using this information, minimalistic artificial intelligence models can be developed to predict sepsis earlier in critically ill patients.","Mohammed, Akram; Van Wyk, Franco; Chinthala, Lokesh K; Khojandi, Anahita; Davis, Robert L; Coopersmith, Craig M; Kamaleswaran, Rishikesan",Shock (Augusta Ga.),533,6

The impact of these surgical delays on survival for patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) remains unknown. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of 37 730 patients in the National Cancer Database with HNSCC who underwent primary surgical management from 2004 to 2016 was performed. Uni- and multivariate analyses were used to identify predictors of overall survival. Bootstrapping methods were used to identify optimal time-to-surgery (TTS) thresholds at which overall survival differences were greatest. Cox proportional hazard models with or without restricted cubic splines were used to determine the association between TTS and survival. RESULTS: The study identified TTS as an independent predictor of overall survival (OS). Bootstrapping the data to dichotomize the cohort identified the largest rise in hazard ratio (HR) at day 67, which was used as the optimal TTS cut-point in survival analysis. The patients who underwent surgical treatment longer than 67 days after diagnosis had a significantly increased risk of death (HR, 1.189; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.122-1.261; P < 0.0001). For every 30-day delay in TTS, the hazard of death increased by 4.6%. Subsite analysis showed that the oropharynx subsite was most affected by surgical delays, followed by the oral cavity. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing TTS is an independent predictor of survival for patients with HNSCC and should be performed within 67 days after diagnosis to achieve optimal survival outcomes.","Rygalski, Chandler J; Zhao, Songzhu; Eskander, Antoine; Zhan, Kevin Y; Mroz, Edmund A; Brock, Guy; Silverman, Dustin A; Blakaj, Dukagjin; Bonomi, Marcelo R; Carrau, Ricardo L; Old, Matthew O; Rocco, James W; Seim, Nolan B; Puram, Sidharth V; Kang, Stephen Y",Ann. surg. oncol,533,24

In densely populated countries like India, lockdown interventions are partially effective due to social and administrative complexities. Using detailed demographic data, we present an agent based model to imitate the behavior of the population and its mobility features, even under intervention. We demonstrate the effectiveness of contact tracing policies and how our model efficiently relates to empirical findings on testing efficiency.

In this expert opinion, conceived by the task force involving the Working Groups on Valvular Heart Diseases and Cardiac Surgery as well as the Association of Cardiovascular Intervention of the Polish Cardiac Society, modification of diagnostic pathways, principles of healthcare personnel protection, and treatment guidelines regarding triage and prioritization are suggested. Heart Teams responsible for the treatment of valvular heart disease should continue their work using telemedicine and digital technology. Diagnostic tests must be simplified or deferred to minimize the number of potentially dangerous aerosol­generating procedures, such as transesophageal echocardiography or exercise imaging. The treatment of aortic stenosis and mitral regurgitation has to be offered particularly due to urgent indications and in patients with advanced disease and poor prognosis. Expert risk stratification is essential for triage and setting the priority lists. In each case, an appropriate level of personal protection must be ensured for the healthcare personnel to prevent spreading infection and preserve specialized manpower, who will supply the continuing need for handling serious chronic cardiovascular disease.

First investigations indicate that the main contributing factor is a lack of visibility into the supply chain's lower tiers. Simultaneously, the willingness to share data in the supply chain is low as companies mainly consider their data as proprietary. However, large amounts of data are available on the internet. The amount of this data is steadily increasing;however, the problem remains, that this data is hardly structured. Therefore, this paper investigates current approaches to use this data for supply chain transparency and derives further research directions. Methodology: The paper uses a systematic review of the literature followed by content analysis. The research process further follows established frameworks in the literature and is subdivided into distinct stages. Findings: Descriptive and clustering results show a fragmented research field, where current approaches disconnect from prior research. We classify the methods using a simple taxonomy and show developments from rule-based to supervised techniques and horizontal to vertical mining approaches. The techniques with rule-based-matching procedures mainly suffer from low recall. The current approaches do not satisfy yet essential requirements on supply chain mapping based on natural language. Originality: To the best of the authors' knowledge, no prior research has been attempted to review textual data usage for supply chain mapping. Therefore, this paper's main contribution is to fill this gap and add further evidence to the use of data-driven supply chain management methods. © 2021 CEUR-WS.

Research Purpose: This article examines the impact of human resource management (HRM) practices on employee engagement in the Egyptian context. The purpose of this article was to develop an in-depth understanding of the concepts of HRM practices and their impact on employee engagement, and the moderating role of strategy implementation. Motivation for the study: Given the scarcity of research that examines the impact of HRM practices on employee engagement especially in the banking sector, this article examines how different HRM practices can influence the level of employee engagement. Research approach/design and method: For the purpose of answering the research questions and testing the proposed hypotheses, a quantitative research approach was adopted by distributing a questionnaire to 228 employees from the banking sector in Egypt. Main findings: The findings indicated that HRM practices had a positive significant impact on employee engagement. In particular, these practices included selection and hiring, job design as well as reward and payment systems. However, the findings showed that the strategic implementation does not moderate the relationship between HRM practices and employee engagement. Practical/managerial implications: This article provides some guidelines for organisations to follow to fully utilise the power of employee engagement by applying effective HRM practices. Contribution/value-add: The contribution of this study is that it is one of the few studies that have so far investigated this relationship in the Egyptian environment.","Saad, Mohamed M.; Gaber, Hazem R.; Labib, Ashraf A.",SA Journal of Human Resource Management,533,21

Their prevalence in the UK, is likely to increase due to new legislation. Clear information regarding the appropriate use of masks is needed, to ensure compliance with policies to reduce transmission of COVID-19. We aimed to assess the impact of visual representations of guidance, or infographics, upon the knowledge of appropriate face mask usage in a representative UK cohort. METHODS: Adult patients were recruited to this randomised internet-based questionnaire study during the 12-14 May 2020 from across the UK. Respondents viewed one of five public health stimuli regarding the use of face masks, or no stimulus. The groups accessed aids by the European Centre for Disease Control (EUCDC), World Health Organisation (WHO), Singaporean Ministry of Health (SMOH), text from the UK government (UK Gov), or an infographic designed by the Behavioural Insights Team (BIT). The primary outcome was to evaluate the effect of each infographic upon participants' recall of face mask technique, sentiments and willingness to wear a face covering. Secondary outcomes included the effect of symptomology and socio-demographic factors. RESULTS: 4099 respondents were randomised (1009 control, 628 EUCDC, 526 WHO, 639 SMOH, 661 UKGOV and 606 BIT). Stimuli from the WHO, SMOH and BIT demonstrated significantly higher average recall scores compared to the controls (7.40 v. 7.38 v. 7.34 v. 6.97, P < 0.001). BIT's stimulus led to the highest confidence about mask-wearing (87%). Only 48.2% of the cohort felt stimuli reduced anxiety about COVID-19. However, willingness to use a mask was high, (range 84 to 88%). CONCLUSIONS: To ensure the appropriate use of masks, as mandated by UK law, guidance must provide sufficient information, yet remain understandable. Infographics can aid the recall of correct mask techniques by highlighting salient steps and reducing cognitive burden. They have also demonstrated greater trustworthiness than text-only guidance. The effect of infographics upon COVID-19-related anxiety was poor, and they should be further developed to address this sentiment. A willingness to wear face masks has, however, been demonstrated.","Egan, Mark; Acharya, Amish; Sounderajah, Viknesh; Xu, Yihan; Mottershaw, Abigail; Phillips, Rosie; Ashrafian, Hutan; Darzi, Ara",BMC Public Health,533,25

Limited by the ability of the country or city in performing tests, the officially reported number of confirmed cases is expected to be much smaller than the true number of infected cases. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to develop a new Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Confirmed-Removed (SEICR) model for predicting the spreading progression of COVID-19 with consideration of intercity travel and the difference between the confirmed cases and the actual infected cases, and to apply the model to provide realistic prediction for USA and Japan under different scenarios of active intervention. METHODS: The model introduces a new state variable corresponding to the actual number of infected cases, integrates intercity travel data to track the movement of exposed and infected individuals among cities, and allows different levels of active intervention to be considered so that realistic prediction of the number of infected individuals can be performed. Moreover, the model generates future progression profiles for different levels of intervention by setting the parameters relative to the values found from the data fitting. RESULTS: By fitting the model with the data of the COVID-19 infection cases and the intercity travel data for Japan (January 15 to March 20, 2020) and the USA (February 20 to March 20, 2020), model parameters are found and then used to predict the pandemic progression in 47 regions of Japan and 50 states (plus a federal district) in the USA. The model reveals that as of March 19, 2020, the number of infected individuals in Japan and the USA could be twenty-fold and five-fold as many as the number of confirmed cases, respectively. Results show that without tightening the implementation of active intervention, Japan and the USA will see about 6.55% and 18.% of the population eventually infected, and with drastic ten-fold elevated active intervention, the number of people eventually infected can be reduced by up to 95% in Japan and 70% in the USA. CONCLUSIONS: The new SEICR model has revealed the effectiveness of active intervention for control the spread of COVID-19. Stepping up active intervention would be more effective for Japan, while raising the level of vigilance of the public in maintaining personal hygiene and social distancing is comparatively more important for the USA.","Zhan, Choujun; Tse, Chi Kong; Lai, Zhikang; Chen, Xiaoyun; Mo, Mingshan",,533,16

This study included 1,908,197 confirmed cases of and 119,257 deaths from COVID-19 from 190 countries between 23 January and 13 April, 2020. We used a distributed lag non-linear model with city-/country-level random intercept to investigate the associations between COVID19 incidence and daily temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed. A series of confounders were considered in the analysis including demographics, socioeconomics, geographic locations, and political strategies. Sensitivity analyses were performed to examine the robustness of the associations. The COVID-19 incidence showed a stronger association with temperature than with relative humidity or wind speed. An inverse association was identified between the COVID-19 incidence and temperature. The corresponding 14-day cumulative relative risk was 1.28 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.20-1.36] at 5 °C, and 0.75 (95% CI, 0.65-0.86) at 22 °C with reference to the risk at 11 °C. An inverse J-shaped association was observed between relative humidity and the COVID-19 incidence, with the highest risk at 72%. A higher wind speed was associated with a generally lower incidence of COVID-19, although the associations were weak. Sensitivity analyses generally yielded similar results. The COVID-19 incidence decreased with the increase of temperature. Our study suggests that the spread of COVID-19 may slow during summer but may increase during winter.","Guo, Cui; Bo, Yacong; Lin, Changqing; Li, Hao Bi; Zeng, Yiqian; Zhang, Yumiao; Hossain, Md Shakhaoat; Chan, Jimmy W M; Yeung, David W; Kwok, Kin-On; Wong, Samuel Y S; Lau, Alexis K H; Lao, Xiang Qian",Sci Total Environ,533,16

DESIGN: 2×3 experimental design. SETTING: Online. PARTICIPANTS: 1204 adults from a UK research panel. INTERVENTION: Participants were randomised to receive one of six descriptions of an antibody test and results showing SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, differing in the terms describing the type of test (Immunity vs Antibody) and the test result (Passport vs Certificate vs Test). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome: proportion of participants perceiving no risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2 given an antibody-positive test result. Other outcomes include: intended changes to frequency of hand washing and physical distancing. RESULTS: When using the term Immunity (vs Antibody), 19.1% of participants (95% CI 16.1% to 22.5%) (vs 9.8% (95% CI 7.5% to 12.4%)) perceived no risk of catching coronavirus given an antibody-positive test result (adjusted OR (AOR): 2.91 (95% CI 1.52 to 5.55)). Using the terms Passport or Certificate-as opposed to Test-had no significant effect (AOR: 1.24 (95% CI 0.62 to 2.48) and AOR: 0.96 (95% CI 0.47 to 1.99) respectively). There was no significant interaction between the effects of the test and result terminology. Across groups, perceiving no risk of infection was associated with an intention to wash hands less frequently (AOR: 2.32 (95% CI 1.25 to 4.28)); there was no significant association with intended avoidance of physical contact (AOR: 1.37 (95% CI 0.93 to 2.03)). CONCLUSIONS: Using the term Immunity (vs Antibody) to describe antibody tests for SARS-CoV-2 increases the proportion of people believing that an antibody-positive result means they have no risk of catching coronavirus in the future, a perception that may be associated with less frequent hand washing.

MethodsA total of 411 COVID-19 patients were enrolled in Kinshasa University Hospital and categorized into two groups according to the pandemic pattern, demographics, and disease severity. The clinical characteristics were compared according to the two waves. To describe survival from the first day of hospitalization until death, we used Kaplan Meiers method. We used the Log Rank test to compare the survival curves between the two waves. The Cox regression was used to identify independent predictors of mortality. ResultsDuring the study period, 411 patients with confirmed COVID-19 were admitted to the hospital. The average age of patients in the 2nd wave was higher than in the first wave (52.4 {+/-}17.5 vs 58.1 {+/-}15.7, p=0.026). The mean saturation was lower in the first wave than in the second. The death rate of patients in the first wave was higher than in the second wave (p=0.009). Survival was reduced in the first wave compared to the second wave. In the first wave, age over 60 years, respiratory distress, law oxygen saturation ([≤]89%) and severe stage of COVID-19 emerged as factors associated with death, while in the second wave it was mainly respiratory distress, law oxygen saturation ([≤] 89%) and severe stage. The predictors of mortality present in both the first and second waves were respiratory distress and severe COVID-19 stage. ConclusionMortality decreased in the second wave. Age no longer emerged as a factor in mortality in the second wave. Health system strengthening and outreach to those at high risk of mortality should continue to maintain and improve gains.","Mandina, Madone; Makulo, jean robert; Wumba, Roger; Bepouka, Ben; odio, jerome; Nkodila, Aliocha; Longokolo, Murielle; Mayasi, Nadine; Mangala, Donatien; Kamwiziku, Guyguy; Longo, Augustin Luzayadio; Mpia, Guillome; Kokusa, Yamine; Keke, Herve; Mbula, Marcel; Situakibanza, Hippolyte; Sumaili, Ernest; Kayembe, Jean Marie",,533,27

This is matched by the availability of machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Deep Neural Networks (DNN) that are computationally expensive to perform on very large data sets with thousands of molecular descriptors. Quantum computer (QC) algorithms have been proposed to offer an approach to accelerate quantum machine learning over classical computer (CC) algorithms, however with significant limitations. In the case of cheminformatics, which is widely used in drug discovery, one of the challenges to overcome is the need for compression of large numbers of molecular descriptors for use on a QC. Here, we show how to achieve compression with data sets using hundreds of molecules (SARS-CoV-2) to hundreds of thousands of molecules (whole cell screening data sets for plague and M. tuberculosis) with SVM and the data reuploading classifier (a DNN equivalent algorithm) on a QC benchmarked against CC and hybrid approaches.

The study aimed to develop an evidence-based CPG for the treatment of AR in children with TCM. Systematic literature research, expert questionnaire, and clinical evaluation after three rounds of surveys were adopted to form recommendations for treating children with AR using the Delphi method. Depending on the clinical manifestations, we finally recommended two decoctions with two Chinese patent medicines for an acute attack of AR and two decoctions for a chronic period of AR. For the acute attack of AR in children, Xinyi Qingfei decoction, Wenfei Zhiliu decoction, Xinqin granules, and Xinyi Biyan pills were suggested, whereas for the chronic period of AR, Buzhong Yiqi and Jingui Shenqi decoctions were recommended. The four external treatment methods suggested for the prevention and care of AR were body acupuncture, moxibustion, auricular point pressing, and acupoint application.

This review aims to describe the crucial role of mitochondria in the development and progression of multiple diseases as well as the close relationship among mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and cytokine storm. Likewise, it attempts to summarize the main findings related to the powerful effects of melatonin and some micronutrients (vitamins and minerals), which may be useful (alone or in combination) as therapeutic agents in the treatment of several examples of oxidative/inflammatory pathologies, including sepsis, as well as cardiovascular, renal, neurodegenerative, and metabolic disorders.","Gimenez, V.

However, despite its diverse role in the regulation of physiological and pathophysiological functions, knowledge about the KKS in vivo remains limited. The short half-lives of kinins, their low abundance and structural similarities and the artificial generation of the kinin bradykinin greatly hinder reliable and accurate determination of kinin levels in plasma. To address these issues, a sensitive LC-MS/MS platform for the comprehensive and simultaneous determination of the four active kinins bradykinin, kallidin, des-Arg(9)-bradykinin and des-Arg(10)-kallidin and their major metabolites bradykinin 2-9, bradykinin 1-7 and bradykinin 1-5 was developed. This platform was validated according to the bioanalytical guideline of the US Food and Drug Administration regarding linearity, accuracy, precision, sensitivity, carry-over, recovery, parallelism, matrix effects and stability in plasma of healthy volunteers. The validated platform encompassed a broad calibration curve range from 2.0-15.3 pg/mL (depending on the kinin) up to 1000 pg/mL, covering the expected concentrations in disease states. No source-dependent matrix effects were identified, and suitable stability of the analytes in plasma was observed. The applicability of the developed platform was proven by the determination of endogenous levels in healthy volunteers, whose plasma kinin levels were successfully detected in the low pg/mL range. The established platform facilitates the investigation of kinin-mediated diseases (e.g. angioedema, COVID-19) and enables the assessment of the impact of altered enzyme activities on the formation or degradation of kinins.","Gangnus, Tanja; Burckhardt, Bjoern B",Anal Bioanal Chem,533,21

The availability of resolved structures allows structure-based computational approaches to be carried out even though the lack of known inhibitors prevents a proper validation of the performed simulations. The innovative idea of the study is to exploit known inhibitors of SARS-CoV 3CL-Pro as a training set to perform and validate multiple virtual screening campaigns. Docking simulations using four different programs (Fred, Glide, LiGen, and PLANTS) were performed investigating the role of both multiple binding modes (by binding space) and multiple isomers/states (by developing the corresponding isomeric space). The computed docking scores were used to develop consensus models, which allow an in-depth comparison of the resulting performances. On average, the reached performances revealed the different sensitivity to isomeric differences and multiple binding modes between the four docking engines. In detail, Glide and LiGen are the tools that best benefit from isomeric and binding space, respectively, while Fred is the most insensitive program. The obtained results emphasize the fruitful role of combining various docking tools to optimize the predictive performances. Taken together, the performed simulations allowed the rational development of highly performing virtual screening workflows, which could be further optimized by considering different 3CL-Pro structures and, more importantly, by including true SARS-CoV-2 3CL-Pro inhibitors (as learning set) when available.","Manelfi, Candida; Gossen, Jonas; Gervasoni, Silvia; Talarico, Carmine; Albani, Simone; Philipp, Benjamin Joseph; Musiani, Francesco; Vistoli, Giulio; Rossetti, Giulia; Beccari, Andrea Rosario; Pedretti, Alessandro",Molecules (Basel),533,8

However, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the availability of recently manufactured hand sanitizer can be limited. The product expiration date set by manufacturers is also minimally regulated. The efficacy of hand sanitizer is entirely determined by its most volatile ingredient, alcohol, which must remain at a concentration greater than 60% (v/v) to kill bacterial and viral pathogens. In our undergraduate Chem 2123W course (Introductory Quantitative Analysis Laboratory) in spring 2021, we designed and conducted an experiment to investigate the alcohol concentration of ethyl alcohol-based commercial hand sanitizers with varying expiration dates. The presence of a primary alcohol functional group in ethyl alcohol can be observed by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT- IR). Through a series of standard additions of ethyl alcohol to the diluted hand sanitizer sample, we measured the changes in the integration of the FT-IR primary alcohol C-O stretch. The signal changes in integration were used to generate a standard addition curve using ethanol concentration and calculate the initial ethanol concentration of each sample. Our approach accounts for this matrix effect and does not rely on a compositional approximation. All the samples studied were found to exceed the minimum concentration required to effectively exhibit antimicrobial properties despite three of the four samples being expired. However, the expired samples remained close to the 60% threshold and with consideration of error analysis, the effectiveness of these hand sanitizers remains uncertain. The samples analyzed in this study varied in reported initial ethyl alcohol concentration, manufacturer, color, perfume, and other ingredients. The heterogeneity of our samples coupled with our consistent results provided insight into consumer use of expired ethyl alcohol-based hand sanitizers.","Max, Shlafstein Emily Hannah ling hao",,533,8

RESEARCH QUESTION: What is the incidence of VTE and bleeding among hospitalized patients with COVID-19? METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, 15 standard sources and COVID-19-specific sources were searched between January 1, 2020, and July 31, 2020, with no restriction according to language. Incidence estimates were pooled by using random effects meta-analyses. Heterogeneity was evaluated by using the I2 statistic, and publication bias was assessed by using the Begg and Egger tests. RESULTS: The pooled incidence was 17.0% (95% CI, 13.4-20.9) for VTE, 12.1% (95% CI, 8.4-16.4) for DVT, 7.1% (95% CI, 5.3-9.1) for pulmonary embolism (PE), 7.8% (95% CI, 2.6-15.3) for bleeding, and 3.9% (95% CI, 1.2-7.9) for major bleeding. In subgroup meta-analyses, the incidence of VTE was higher when assessed according to screening (33.1% vs 9.8% by clinical diagnosis), among patients in the ICU (27.9% vs 7.1% in the ward), in prospective studies (25.5% vs 12.4% in retrospective studies), and with the inclusion of catheter-associated thrombosis/isolated distal DVTs and isolated subsegmental PEs. The highest pooled incidence estimate of bleeding was reported for patients receiving intermediate- or full-dose anticoagulation (21.4%) and the lowest in the only prospective study that assessed bleeding events (2.7%). INTERPRETATION: Among hospitalized patients with COVID-19, the overall estimated pooled incidence of VTE was 17.0%, with higher rates with routine screening, inclusion of distal DVT, and subsegmental PE, in critically ill patients and in prospective studies. Bleeding events were observed in 7.8% of patients and were sensitive to use of escalated doses of anticoagulants and nature of data collection.

RESEARCH QUESTION: What is the incidence of VTE and bleeding among hospitalized patients with COVID-19? METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, 15 standard sources and COVID-19-specific sources were searched between January 1, 2020, and July 31, 2020, with no restriction according to language. Incidence estimates were pooled by using random effects meta-analyses. Heterogeneity was evaluated by using the I2 statistic, and publication bias was assessed by using the Begg and Egger tests. RESULTS: The pooled incidence was 17.0% (95% CI, 13.4-20.9) for VTE, 12.1% (95% CI, 8.4-16.4) for DVT, 7.1% (95% CI, 5.3-9.1) for pulmonary embolism (PE), 7.8% (95% CI, 2.6-15.3) for bleeding, and 3.9% (95% CI, 1.2-7.9) for major bleeding. In subgroup meta-analyses, the incidence of VTE was higher when assessed according to screening (33.1% vs 9.8% by clinical diagnosis), among patients in the ICU (27.9% vs 7.1% in the ward), in prospective studies (25.5% vs 12.4% in retrospective studies), and with the inclusion of catheter-associated thrombosis/isolated distal DVTs and isolated subsegmental PEs. The highest pooled incidence estimate of bleeding was reported for patients receiving intermediate- or full-dose anticoagulation (21.4%) and the lowest in the only prospective study that assessed bleeding events (2.7%). INTERPRETATION: Among hospitalized patients with COVID-19, the overall estimated pooled incidence of VTE was 17.0%, with higher rates with routine screening, inclusion of distal DVT, and subsegmental PE, in critically ill patients and in prospective studies. Bleeding events were observed in 7.8% of patients and were sensitive to use of escalated doses of anticoagulants and nature of data collection.

However, data are lacking on the impact of COVID-19 on hip fractures, seen mainly in older patients. Using national claims data, we aimed to describe the epidemiology during the first COVID-19 wave in the USA. METHODS: We compared patients admitted for hip fractures during March and April of 2020 with those admitted in 2019 in terms of patient and healthcare characteristics, COVID-19 diagnosis, and outcomes. An additional comparison was made between COVID-19-positive and -negative patients. Outcomes included length of hospital stay (LOS), admission to an ICU, ICU LOS, use of mechanical ventilation, 30-day readmission, discharge disposition, and a composite variable of postoperative complications. RESULTS: Overall, 16 068 hip fractures were observed in 2019 compared with 7498 in 2020. Patients with hip fractures in 2020 (compared with 2019) experienced earlier hospital discharge and were less likely to be admitted to ICU, but more likely to be admitted to home. Amongst 83 patients with hip fractures with concomitant COVID-19 diagnosis, we specifically observed more non-surgical treatments, almost doubled LOS, a more than 10-fold increased mortality rate, and higher complication rates compared with COVID-19-negative patients. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted not only volume of hip fractures, but also patterns in care and outcomes. These results may inform policymakers in future outbreaks and how this may affect vulnerable patient populations, such as those experiencing a hip fracture.","Zhong, Haoyan; Poeran, Jashvant; Liu, Jiabin; Wilson, Lauren A; Memtsoudis, Stavros G",Br J Anaesth,533,20

In this scenario, healthcare students can act as reliable information providers. This study aimed to assess the knowledge and perception about COVID-19 among medical and allied health science students. Methods: A web-based cross sectional survey was conducted during February and March 2020. A 24-item survey was developed and randomly distributed among the study population. Descriptive statistics was applied to represent participant characteristics and Chi-square test was used to evaluate the level of association among variables with a significance level of p < 0.01. Results: Total, 97.95% (715/730) participants completed the survey. High proportion of students were from pharmacy (45.73%) followed by medical (22.52%), physiotherapy, nursing and dental background. Majority of participants were having adequate knowledge while about 18% had partial knowledge about the symptoms of severe COVID-19 cases. Students have shown a positive perception of COVID-19 prevention and control while few invalid responses related to the use of herbal medicines or garlic were noted. About 50% had rightly stated that, the antibiotics and vaccine are not effective in COVID-19 infection at present. Conclusion: As the COVID-19 cases are rapidly increasing worldwide, it is essential to improve the knowledge and beliefs among general public to prevent its spread. Health care students with their education background and basic understanding about COVID-19 can play a significant role by making community people aware about the seriousness of this pandemic situation.","Gohel, Kushalkumar H; Patel, Prati B; Shah, Pushti M; Patel, Jay R; Pandit, Niraj; Raut, Asavari",,533,24

Hosts with altered immunity, including solid organ transplant recipients, may be at increased risk of complications and death due to COVID-19. A synthesis of the available data on immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection is needed to inform therapeutic and preventative strategies in this special population. Recent Findings: Few studies have directly compared immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 between transplant recipients and the general population. Like non-transplant patients, transplant recipients mount an exuberant inflammatory response following initial SARS-CoV2 infection, with IL-6 levels correlating with disease severity in some, but not all studies. Transplant recipients display anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and activated B cells in a time frame and magnitude similar to non-transplant patients-limited data suggest these antibodies can be detected within 15 days of symptom onset and may be durable for several months. CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphopenia, a hallmark of COVID-19, is more profound in transplant recipients, but SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cells can be detected among patients with both mild and severe disease. Summary: The limited available data indicate that immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 are similar between transplant recipients and the general population, but no studies have been sufficiently comprehensive to understand nuances between organ types or level of immunosuppression to meaningfully inform individualized therapeutic decisions. The ongoing pandemic provides an opportunity to generate higher-quality data to support rational treatment and vaccination strategies in this population.","Phadke, Varun K; Scanlon, Nicholas; Jordan, Stanley C; Rouphael, Nadine G",Curr Transplant Rep,533,15

Home healthcare reflects a group of people especially vulnerable to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We aimed to evaluate the pattern of comorbidity and frailty in a group of individuals having fatal outcomes in home healthcare during the COVID-19 pandemic March to September 2020, and to assess the contribution of COVID-19 in the fatal outcomes. METHODS: A cohort of adults with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis that deceased in home healthcare between March and September 2020 were analysed in a retrospective study comprising home healthcare in 136 facilities in one Swedish county. Main outcome measures were comorbidity and frailty. RESULTS: One hundred fifty-five individuals (88 women, 67 men) aged 57-106 (median 88) years were included in the analysis. Nine had considerable frailty (ability to perform various activities of daily living but confined to bed or chair on occasion) and the remaining 146 had severe frailty (unable to perform activities of daily living and/or confined to bed or chair; dementia necessitating care). Three or more diagnoses besides COVID-19 were present in 142 individuals and another eight had two diagnoses in addition to COVID-19. In 20 (13%) individuals, COVID-19 was assessed as the principal cause of death, in 100 (64.5%) a contributing cause, and for the remaining 35 (22.5%) death was probably caused by another comorbidity. This seemed to change over the course of the COVID - 19 pandemic, with its contributing role decreasing from the middle of the summer. CONCLUSIONS: Death in home healthcare during the first wave of the pandemic mostly affected individuals with severe frailty and comorbidity at very advanced ages. One fifth of the individuals who died in home health care had another cause than Covid-19.

Studies have reported mild elevations of lipase levels of unclear significance. Our study aims to determine the outcomes in patients with COVID-19 and hyperlipasemia, and whether correlation with D-dimer levels explains the effect on outcomes. METHODS: Case-control study from two large tertiary care health systems, of patients with COVID-19 disease admitted between March 1 and May 1, 2020 who had lipase levels recorded. Data analyzed to study primary outcomes of mortality, length of stay (LOS) and intensive care utilization in hyperlipasemia patients, and correlation with D-dimer and outcomes. RESULTS: 992 out of 5597 COVID-19 patients had lipase levels, of which 429 (43%) had hyperlipasemia. 152 (15%) patients had a lipase > 3x ULN, with clinical pancreatitis in 2 patients. Hyperlipasemia had a higher mortality than normal lipase patients (32% vs. 23%, OR = 1.6,95%CI = 1.2-2.1, P = 0.002). In subgroup analysis, hyperlipasemia patients had significantly worse LOS (11vs.15 days, P = 0.01), ICU admission rates (44% vs. 66%,OR = 2.5,95%CI = 1.3-5.0,P = 0.008), ICU LOS (12vs.19 days,P = 0.01), mechanical ventilation rates (34% vs. 55%,OR = 2.4,95%CI = 1.3-4.8,P = 0.01), and durations of mechanical ventilation (14 vs. 21 days, P = 0.008). Hyperlipasemia patients were more likely to have a D-dimer value in the highest two quartiles, and had increased mortality (59% vs. 15%,OR = 7.2,95%CI = 4.5-11,P < 0.001) and LOS (10vs.7 days,P < 0.001) compared to those with normal lipase and lower D-dimer levels. CONCLUSION: There is high prevalence of hyperlipasemia without clinical pancreatitis in COVID-19 disease. Hyperlipasemia was associated with higher mortality and ICU utilization, possibly explained by elevated D-dimer.","Ahmed, Awais; Fisher, Jason C; Pochapin, Mark B; Freedman, Steven D; Kothari, Darshan J; Shah, Paresh C; Sheth, Sunil G",Pancreatology,533,16

T cells can contribute to the rapid clearance of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronavirus infections1-5. We hypothesised that pre-existing memory T cell responses, with cross-protective potential against SARS-CoV-26-12, would expand in vivo to mediate rapid viral control, potentially aborting infection. We studied T cells against the replication transcription complex (RTC) of SARS-CoV-2 since this is transcribed first in the viral life cycle13-15and should be highly conserved. We measured SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cells in a cohort of intensively monitored healthcare workers (HCW) who remained repeatedly negative by PCR, antibody binding, and neutralisation for SARS-CoV-2 (exposed seronegative, ES). 16-weeks post-recruitment, ES had memory T cells that were stronger and more multispecific than an unexposed pre-pandemic cohort, and more frequently directed against the RTC than the structural protein-dominated responses seen post-detectable infection (matched concurrent cohort). The postulate that HCW with the strongest RTC-specific T cells had an abortive infection was supported by a low-level increase in IFI27 transcript, a robust early innate signature of SARS-CoV-2 infection16. We showed that the RNA-polymerase within RTC was the largest region of high sequence conservation across human seasonal coronaviruses (HCoV) and was preferentially targeted by T cells from UK and Singapore pre-pandemic cohorts and from ES. RTC epitope-specific T cells capable of cross-recognising HCoV variants were identified in ES. Longitudinal samples from ES and an additional validation cohort, showed pre-existing RNA-polymerase-specific T cells expanded in vivo following SARS-CoV-2 exposure, becoming enriched in the memory response of those with abortive compared to overt infection. In summary, we provide evidence of abortive seronegative SARS-CoV-2 infection with expansion of cross-reactive RTC-specific T cells, highlighting these highly conserved proteins as targets for future vaccines against endemic and emerging Coronaviridae.","Swadling, Leo; Diniz, Mariana O; Schmidt, Nathalie M; Amin, Oliver E; Chandran, Aneesh; Shaw, Emily; Pade, Corinna; Gibbons, Joseph M; Bert, Nina Le; Tan, Anthony T; Tham, Christine Y L; Tan, Cedric; Kucyowicz, Stephanie; Aidoo-Micah, Gloryanne; Rosenheim, Joshua; Davies, Jessica; Jensen, Melanie P; Joy, George; McCoy, Laura E; Valdes, Ana M; Dorp, Lucy van; Altmann, Daniel M; Boyton, Rosemary J; Manisty, Charlotte; Treibel, Thomas A; Moon, James C; Investigators, - COVIDsortium; Balloux, Francois; McKnight, Aine; Noursadeghi, Mahdad; Bertoletti, Antonio; Maini, Mala K",,533,12

With relatively fewer patient interactions, radiology trainees are particularly susceptible to insufficient contextual awareness of how socioeconomic factors influence patient health and behaviors, physician recommendations, and ultimately clinical outcomes. The purpose of this article is to provide a high-yield background of foundational health equity and disparity concepts for radiology trainees, from which additional educational curricula may be derived. Specifically, this article will discuss the fundamental socioeconomic factors known to contribute to discrepant access and use of imaging services, followed by areas in radiology with well-documented disparities of which trainees should be aware. Lastly, previous and current strategies for addressing disparities in radiology will be discussed with the ultimate goal of stimulating trainee participation and the development of novel approaches.","Mach, John C; Omar, Abdillahi; Abujudeh, Hani",Curr. probl. diagn. radiol,533,26

Whilst diagnostic testing has progressed at pace, there is an unmet clinical need to develop tests that are prognostic, to triage the high volumes of patients arriving in hospital settings. Recent research has shown that serum metabolomics has potential for prognosis of disease progression. 1 In a hospital setting, collection of saliva samples is more convenient for both staff and patients, and therefore offers an alternative sampling matrix to serum. We demonstrate here for the first time that saliva metabolomics can reveal COVID-19 severity. Methods88 saliva samples were collected from hospitalised patients with clinical suspicion of COVID-19, alongside clinical metadata. COVID-19 diagnosis was confirmed using RT-PCR testing. COVID severity was classified using clinical descriptors first proposed by SR Knight et al. Metabolites were extracted from saliva samples and analysed using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. ResultsIn this work, positive percent agreement of 1.00 between a PLS-DA metabolomics model and the clinical diagnosis of COVID severity was achieved. The negative percent agreement with the clinical severity diagnosis was also 1.00, for overall percent agreement of 1.00. ConclusionsThis research demonstrates that liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry can identify salivary biomarkers capable of separating high severity COVID-19 patients from low severity COVID-19 patients in a small cohort study.","Frampas, Cecile; Longman, Katie; Spick, Matt P; Lewis, Holly M; Costa, Catia D; Stewart, Alexander; Dunn-Walters, Deborah; Skene, Debra; Greener, Danni; Evetts, George E; Trivedi, Drupad K; Barran, Perdita; Pitt, Andrew; Hollywood, Katherine; Bailey, Melanie",,533,16

Global trends in camping show that this type of recreational activity has begun to emerge in Asia. Meeting the expectations of potential and current tourists in a camping destination will lead to the accomplishment of competitive advantage. The endurance involvement and place attachment play important roles in understanding camping behaviors. However, limited research identified place attachment as a moderator of the influence of endurance involvement on camping travel behavior. To fill this gap, based on place attachment theory, our study developed a conceptual model that postulates endurance involvement and place attachment as predictors of camping tourism. 216 self-administered questionnaires were retuned. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to test the psychometric properties of the measures, while regression analysis was employed to assess the research hypotheses. The study results show that endurance involvement in camping affects camping travel behavior, whereas camping place dependence, camping place identity, and camping affective attachment moderate the effect of camping endurance involvement on camping travel behavior. Camping place attachment strengthens the relationship between camping endurance involvement and camping travel behavior. To maintain the sustainable development of camping tourism, campsite authorities should attach more importance to strengthening campers’ emotional bonds and concentrate on how to encourage them to participate in tourism activities. The findings have several theoretical and managerial implications for camping tourism marketing and the development of campground.","Wong, Jehn-Yih Ming-Lee Hsiung Shu-Ju Lee Chia-Ying ChouHuang",Sustainability,533,20

RESULTS: The perception of university undergraduates with regards to PM and PGx was investigated, and 80% of undergraduates valued PM as a promising healthcare model with 66% indicating awareness of personal genome testing companies. When asked about the curriculum design towards PM and PGx, compared to undergraduates in non-medically related curriculum, those studying in medically related curriculum had an adjusted 7.2 odds of perceiving that their curriculum was well-designed for learning PGx (95% CI 3.6-14.6) and a 3.7 odds of perceiving that PGx was important in their study (95% CI 2.0-6.8). Despite this, only 16% of medically related curriculum undergraduates would consider embarking on future education on PM. When asked about their perceptions on GT, 60% rated their genetic knowledge as ""School Biology"" level or below while 76% would consider undergoing a genetic test. As for ELSI, 75% of undergraduates perceived that they were aware of ethical issues of GT in general, particularly on ""Patient Privacy"" (80%) and ""Data Confidentiality"" (68%). Undergraduates were also asked about their perceived reaction upon receiving an unfavorable result from GT, and over half of the participants perceived that they would feel ""helpless or pessimistic"" (56%), ""inadequate or different"" (59%), and ""disadvantaged at job seeking"" (59%), while older undergraduates had an adjusted 2.0 odds of holding the latter opinion (95% CI 1.1-3.5), compared to younger undergraduates. CONCLUSION: Hong Kong undergraduates showed a high awareness of PM but insufficient genetic knowledge and low interest in pursuing a career towards PM. They were generally aware of ethical issues of GT and especially concerned about patient privacy and data confidentiality. There was a predominance of pessimistic views towards unfavorable testing results. This study calls for the attention to evaluate education and talent development on genomics, and update existing legal frameworks on genetic testing in Hong Kong.","Cheung, Nicholas Yan Chai; Fung, Jasmine Lee Fong; Ng, Yvette Nga Chung; Wong, Wilfred Hing Sang; Chung, Claudia Ching Yan; Mak, Christopher Chun Yu; Chung, Brian Hon Yin",Hum Genomics,533,21

For this purpose, contact-tracing apps are being proposed for large scale adoption by many countries. A centralized approach, where data sensed by the app are all sent to a nation-wide server, raises concerns about citizens' privacy and needlessly strong digital surveillance, thus alerting us to the need to minimize personal data collection and avoiding location tracking. We advocate the conceptual advantage of a decentralized approach, where both contact and location data are collected exclusively in individual citizens'""personal data stores"", to be shared separately and selectively, voluntarily, only when the citizen has tested positive for COVID-19, and with a privacy preserving level of granularity. This approach better protects the personal sphere of citizens and affords multiple benefits: it allows for detailed information gathering for infected people in a privacy-preserving fashion; and, in turn this enables both contact tracing, and, the early detection of outbreak hotspots on more finely-granulated geographic scale. Our recommendation is two-fold. First to extend existing decentralized architectures with a light touch, in order to manage the collection of location data locally on the device, and allow the user to share spatio-temporal aggregates - if and when they want, for specific aims - with health authorities, for instance. Second, we favour a longer-term pursuit of realizing a Personal Data Store vision, giving users the opportunity to contribute to collective good in the measure they want, enhancing self-awareness, and cultivating collective efforts for rebuilding society.","Nanni, Mirco; Andrienko, Gennady; Barab'asi, Albert-L'aszl'o; Boldrini, Chiara; Bonchi, Francesco; Cattuto, Ciro; Chiaromonte, Francesca; Comand'e, Giovanni; Conti, Marco; Cot'e, Mark; Dignum, Frank; Dignum, Virginia; Domingo-Ferrer, Josep; Ferragina, Paolo; Giannotti, Fosca; Guidotti, Riccardo; Helbing, Dirk; Kaski, Kimmo; Kertesz, Janos; Lehmann, Sune; Lepri, Bruno; Lukowicz, Paul; Matwin, Stan; Jim'enez, David Meg'ias; Monreale, Anna; Morik, Katharina; Oliver, Nuria; Passarella, Andrea; Passerini, Andrea; Pedreschi, Dino; Pentland, Alex; Pianesi, Fabio; Pratesi, Francesca; Rinzivillo, Salvatore; Ruggieri, Salvatore; Siebes, Arno; Trasarti, Roberto; Hoven, Jeroen van den; Vespignani, Alessandro",,533,1

Bacteria can form biofilms on implant surfaces, making them more difficult to detect and treat. Since standard antibiotic therapy is often impaired in biofilm infections, particular interest is directed towards finding treatment alternatives. Biofilm-formation is a well-organized process during which bacteria communicate via quorum-sensing molecules (QSM). The aim of this study was to inhibit bacterial communication by directing avian IgY against specific QSM. Methods: Chicken were immunized against the following QSM: (1) AtlE, a member of the autolysin family which mediates attachment to a surface in Staphylococcus epidermidis; (2) GroEL, the bacterial heat shock protein; (3) PIA (polysaccharide intercellular adhesion), which is essential for cell-cell adhesion in biofilms. Staphylococcus epidermidis biofilms were grown and inhibition of biofilm-formation by IgYs was evaluated. Additionally, human osteoblasts were cultivated and biocompatibility of IgYs was tested. Results: We were able to demonstrate that all IgYs reduced biofilm-formation, also without prior immunization. Therefore, the response was probably not specific with regard to the QSM. Osteoblasts were activated by all IgYs which was demonstrated by microscopy and an increased release of IL-8. Conclusions: In conclusion, avian IgY inhibits biofilm-formation, though the underlying mechanism is not yet clear. However, adverse effects on local tissue cells (osteoblasts) were also observed.","Dapunt, Ulrike; Prior, Birgit; Oelkrug, Christopher; Kretzer, Jan Philippe",Molecules (Basel),533,26

Such transformations can be positive by expanding the use of digital technologies, but they can also have serious future physical and emotional consequences if there is no conscious use of technological devices. OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to validate the BCSDTSD instrument for assessing behavioral changes related to the use of digital technologies during social distancing. METHOD: Validation of the BCSDTSD in 5 phases: 1. construction of an initial scale with 10 questions; 2. evaluation of the questions by a panel of experts; 3. application to 1,012 volunteers via the internet; 4. statistical analysis of the results; and 5. preparation of the validated final version of the BCSDTSD. Data analysis used the dplyr, psy, and paran packages and the REdaS statistical program. Three statistical criteria were used in the factor analysis (FA). RESULTS: FA confirmed the maintenance of the 10 questions in the questionnaire, confirming its robust construction, and Cronbach's alpha reinforced the internal consistency with a value of 0.725, which is satisfactory for first-application questionnaires.

We describe the spectrum of clinicopathologic lesions in the skin that can be the only symptom or the first manifestation of COVID-19 and demonstrate the origin of the virus.

However, these tests require cold-chain shipping to distribute, and the labor of skilled technicians to assemble reactions and interpret the results. Strategies to reduce shipping and labor costs at the point-of-care could aid in diagnostic testing scale-up and response to the COVID-19 outbreak, as well as in future outbreaks. METHODS: In this study we test both lab-developed and commercial SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic RT-qPCR mixes for the ability to be stabilized against elevated temperature by lyophilization. Fully assembled reactions were lyophilized and stored for up to a month at ambient or elevated temperature and were subsequently assayed for their ability to detect dilutions of synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA. RESULTS: Of the mixes tested, we show that one commercial mix can maintain activity and sensitivity after storage for at least 30 days at ambient temperature after lyophilization. We also demonstrate that lyoprotectants such as disaccharides can stabilize freeze-dried diagnostic reactions against elevated temperatures (up to 50°C) for at least 30 days. CONCLUSION: We anticipate that the incorporation of these methods into SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing will improve testing pipelines by reducing labor at the testing facility and eliminating the need for cold-chain shipping.

Since these approximating submanifolds might have different dimensions, we are able to detect non-manifold like singular regions in data even when none of the data points have been sampled from those singularities. We showcase this method by identifying the intersection of two surfaces in the 24-dimensional space of cyclo-octane conformations, and by locating all the self-intersections of a Henneberg minimal surface immersed in 3-dimensional space.

At the same time, social isolation restrictions have disrupted most in-person mental health services. Many mental health providers are adapting to the crisis by utilizing telemental health. However, the literature is scant about how to most effectively utilize telemental health practices with refugee clients, many of whom do not speak English and require an interpreter, may have limited technological proficiency or access, and/or have additional case management needs and coordination as part of their treatment plan. The purpose of this study is to understand how mental health clinicians and case workers at a refugee-serving mental health clinic are successfully shifting their face-to-face practice to telemental health, the obstacles they encounter, and what resources they have found to be helpful. Two main themes emerged from the data: (1) refugee mental health providers display initiative and flexibility in their adaptation to telemental health and (2) providers reported numerous obstacles to effective telemental health, including client barriers, tech barriers, communication issues, and the challenge of reading nonverbal cues virtually. By better understanding telemental health when working with refugees, clinical social workers will be more effective in meeting the needs of a population with significant mental health needs and limited mental healthcare access.","Disney, Lindsey; Mowbray, Orion; Evans, Dana",Clin Soc Work J,533,10

Synergies between loss of C9ORF72 functions and gain of toxicities from the repeat expansions contribute to C9ORF72-mediated pathogenesis. However, how loss of C9orf72 impacts neuronal and synaptic functions remains undetermined. Here, we showed that long-term potentiation at the dentate granule cells and long-term depression at the Schaffer collateral/commissural synapses at the area CA1 were reduced in the hippocampus of C9orf72 knockout mice. Using unbiased transcriptomic analysis, we identified that Klotho, a longevity gene, was selectively dysregulated in an age-dependent manner. Specifically, Klotho protein expression in the hippocampus of C9orf72 knockout mice was incorrectly enriched in the dendritic regions of CA1 with concomitant reduction in granule cell layer of dentate gyrus at 3-month of age followed by an accelerating decline during aging. Furthermore, adult hippocampal neurogenesis was reduced in C9orf72 knockout mice. Taken together, our data suggest that C9ORF72 is required for synaptic plasticity and adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus and Klotho deregulations may be part of C9ORF72-mediated toxicity.","Ho, Wan Yun; Navakkode, Sheeja; Liu, Fujia; Soong, Tuck Wah; Ling, Shuo-Chien",Acta Neuropathol Commun,533,26

The country has since been hit by second and third waves in November and December 2020 respectively, almost at the first anniversary of the pandemic. AREAS COVERED: This perspective provides an in-depth analysis of the COVID-19 positive cases in the UK throughout the year, the number of hospitalisations, patients in critical care, and COVID-19 associated deaths. EXPERT OPINION: The COVID-19 associated hospital admission represents only 15% of total COVID-19 positive cases in November 2020 compared to around 65% during the first wave. In April 2020, 17% of total COVID-19 positive patients in the country died from the disease, this was dropped to under 4% in November 2020. Age was the single most determinator of COVID-19 associated mortality, people with 50 years or older age accounted for 98% of total COVID deaths recorded in the country. This probes interesting questions about the current state of immunity, national lockdown, and mass immunisation measures to curb the pandemic cycle; it also emphasises the need to invest in novel antivirals to save the most vulnerable in the society and hence a refocus in efforts and resources needed to bring the life back to normality.","Merchant, Hamid A; Kow, Chia Siang; Hasan, Syed Shahzad",Expert rev. respir. med,533,16

Social media provides an opportunity to estimate emerging risks to vaccine acceptance by including geographical location and detailing vaccine-related concerns. Methods for classifying social media posts, such as vaccine-related tweets, use language models (LMs) trained on general domain text. However, challenges to measuring vaccine sentiment at scale arise from the absence of tonal stress and gestural cues and may not always have additional information about the user, e.g., past tweets or social connections. Another challenge in LMs is the lack of commonsense knowledge that are apparent in users metadata, i.e., emoticons, positive and negative words etc. In this study, to classify vaccine sentiment tweets with limited information, we present a novel end-to-end framework consisting of interconnected components that use domain-specific LM trained on vaccine-related tweets and models commonsense knowledge into a bidirectional gated recurrent network (CK-BiGRU) with context-aware attention. We further leverage syntactical, user metadata and sentiment information to capture the sentiment of a tweet. We experimented using two popular vaccine-related Twitter datasets and demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art models in identifying pro-vaccine, anti-vaccine and neutral tweets.","Naseem, Usman; Khushi, Matloob; Kim, Jinman; Dunn, Adam G.",,533,1

This is particularly relevant for organisms restricted to high elevations because they are adapted to cold temperatures and low oxygen availability. Therefore, evaluating trait plasticity of mountain specialists is fundamental to understand their vulnerability to environmental change. We transplanted mountain lizards, Iberolacerta cyreni, 800 m downhill to evaluate the plastic response in body condition, thermoregulation traits, haemoglobin level, and haemoparasite load. Initial measurements of body mass, total haemoglobin concentration ([Hb]), hematic parasite intensities, dorsal luminance, and thermoregulatory behaviour were resampled after two and four weeks of acclimation. We also tested whether an anti-parasitic drug reduced haemoparasite intensity. After only two weeks of acclimation to a lower elevation, lizards decreased 42% in [Hb], had 17% less parasite intensities, increased body condition by 25%, and raised by ~3% their mean preferred temperatures and their voluntary thermal maximum. The anti-parasitic treatment had no significant effect on the intensity of hematic parasites, but our results suggest that negative effects of haemoparasites on [Hb] are relaxed at lower elevation. The rapid plastic changes observed in thermal preferences, body condition, [Hb], and parasite intensity of I. cyreni demonstrate a potential plastic response of a mountain specialist. This may be adaptive under the climatic extremes typical of mountain habitats. However, there is uncertainty in whether the observed plasticity can also help overcome long term environmental changes.","Megía-Palma, R; Jiménez-Robles, O; Hernández-Agüero, J A; De la Riva, I",J Therm Biol,533,24

AIMS: The purpose of this study is to assess the level of stress-induced cognition among radiologic technologists (RTs) in COVID-19 quarantine centres in Palestine after the outbreak of COVID-19. METHODS: Stress-induced cognition was assessed using Stress-induced Cognition Scale (SCS) questionnaire. The validity and stability of the measuring tool was verified. The sample consisted of 61 RTs who are working currently at various quarantine centres in Palestine. RESULTS: Cognition-induced stress was higher than average. There was a statistically significant difference between RTs working directly with COVID-19 patient compared with RTs working indirectly. Additionally, results show an increased level of stress for RTs having children compared with single or non-parent RTs.

The present study aimed to describe the clinical, laboratory and radiological characteristics of 2019­nCoV pneumonia (NCP) in Zhejiang province, outside of Wuhan. A total of 74 patients with 2019­nCoV were continuously enrolled between January 22 and March 2, 2020 at Zhejiang Hospital. Diagnosis was confirmed at Zhejiang Hospital by reverse transcription­PCR (RT­PCR), which was approved by the Chinese government. Subsequently, the clinical features between positive­ and negative­NCP patients in Zhejiang were compared. Among the 74 hospitalized patients with suspected 2019­NCP, six patients (one male and five female patients) were confirmed to be infected with 2019­nCoV by RT­PCR. The average age of the confirmed patients was 40±13 years. There were three family clusters among the confirmed cases, one patient from each of these families had travel history or contact with patients from Wuhan within 2 weeks. Compared with non­NCP patients, the most common symptoms at onset for patients with NCP were fever (5/6; 83.3%) and cough (5/6; 83.3%), followed by dyspnea/pharyngalgia (2/6; 33.3%), whereas myalgia (1/6; 16.7%) and fatigue (1/6; 16.7%) were less common. All 74 patients with suspected NCP exhibited abnormal computerized tomography (CT) images. In total, 2/6 (33.3%) patients with confirmed NCP presented with bilateral pneumonia, and 21/68 (30.9%) non­NCP patients exhibited bilateral pneumonia, with bilateral distribution of patchy shadows or ground glass opacity. The present study revealed that epidemiological history was critical to the diagnosis of 2019­nCoV in low epidemic regions outside Hubei province. It was also identified that chest CT could not replace nucleic acid testing due to similar radiological manifestations.","Chen, Ling; Jin, Qiuhong; Zhou, Ying; Yang, Jiao; Wang, Zhehua; Ge, Ke; Yang, Jiangle; Wang, Hong",Mol Med Rep,533,33

But its democratizing effect cannot be realized if a segment of the population faces systematic exclusion based on income or wealth. The problem of unequal access to jury service based on socio-economic disparities is a longstanding yet under-studied problem-and one which the uneven fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic only exacerbated. Like race- and sex-based jury discrimination during the peremptory challenge phase of jury selection, the routine dismissal of citizens who face economic hardship excludes not only people but also the diversity of ideas, experiences, and frames of interpretation that characterize the American population. By failing to make sure that people who are poor can serve, we impoverish our shared understanding of doing justice. This Article offers a historical and empirical account of how socio-economic exclusion cuts prospective jurors from juries. It argues that the dominant rationale for such exclusion is a perception that poor and otherwise burdened prospective jurors should be excused from jury service for their own benefit. The effect of this superficially benevolent rationale, I argue, has been the concealment and reinforcement of class-based jury discrimination. The Article concludes that addressing this seemingly benign but exclusionary practice is an essential task for legal reformers, recognizing the relationship between race and class-based exclusion. Further, it recommends instituting structural changes that would make it possible for any eligible person to serve, regardless of income or wealth.","Offit, Anna",Washington Law Review,533,30

However, cognitive decline may be a complication following all types of AIH. This systematic review will summarize longitudinal observational studies documenting cognitive changes following AIH in the majority admitted population and conduct meta-analysis (MA) to assess the quantitative effect of AIH on post-hospitalization cognitive decline (PHCD). METHODS: We followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Selection criteria were defined to identify studies of older age adults exposed to AIH with cognitive measures. 6566 titles were screened. 46 reports were reviewed qualitatively, of which seven contributed data to the MA. Risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. RESULTS: The qualitative review suggested increased cognitive decline following AIH, but several reports were particularly vulnerable to bias. Domain-specific outcomes following AIH included declines in memory and processing speed. Increasing age and the severity of illness were the most consistent risk factors for PHCD. PHCD was supported by MA of seven eligible studies with 41,453 participants (Cohen's d = -0.25, 95% CI [-0.02, -0.49] I2 35%). CONCLUSIONS: There is preliminary evidence that AIH exposure accelerates or triggers cognitive decline in the elderly patient. PHCD reported in specific contexts could be subsets of a larger phenomenon and caused by overlapping mechanisms. Future research must clarify the trajectory, clinical significance, and etiology of PHCD: a priority in the face of an aging population with increasing rates of both cognitive impairment and hospitalization.","Chinnappa-Quinn, Lucia; Makkar, Steve Robert; Bennett, Michael; Lam, Ben C P; Lo, Jessica W; Kochan, Nicole A; Crawford, John D; Sachdev, Perminder S",Int Psychogeriatr,533,16

Objective: To estimate the prevalence of and risk factors associated with depression symptoms among US adults during vs before the COVID-19 pandemic. Design, Setting, and Participants: This nationally representative survey study used 2 population-based surveys of US adults aged 18 or older. During COVID-19, estimates were derived from the COVID-19 and Life Stressors Impact on Mental Health and Well-being study, conducted from March 31, 2020, to April 13, 2020. Before COVID-19 estimates were derived from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, conducted from 2017 to 2018. Data were analyzed from April 15 to 20, 2020. Exposures: The COVID-19 pandemic and outcomes associated with the measures to mitigate it. Main Outcomes and Measures: Depression symptoms, defined using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 cutoff of 10 or higher. Categories of depression symptoms were defined as none (score, 0-4), mild (score, 5-9), moderate (score, 10-14), moderately severe (score, 15-19), and severe (score, &#8805;20). Results: A total of 1470 participants completed the COVID-19 and Life Stressors Impact on Mental Health and Well-being survey (completion rate, 64.3%), and after removing those with missing data, the final during-COVID-19 sample included 1441 participants (619 participants [43.0%] aged 18-39 years; 723 [50.2%] men; 933 [64.7%] non-Hispanic White). The pre-COVID-19 sample included 5065 participants (1704 participants [37.8%] aged 18-39 years; 2588 [51.4%] women; 1790 [62.9%] non-Hispanic White). Depression symptom prevalence was higher in every category during COVID-19 compared with before (mild: 24.6% [95% CI, 21.8%-27.7%] vs 16.2% [95% CI, 15.1%-17.4%]; moderate: 14.8% [95% CI, 12.6%-17.4%] vs 5.7% [95% CI, 4.8%-6.9%]; moderately severe: 7.9% [95% CI, 6.3%-9.8%] vs 2.1% [95% CI, 1.6%-2.8%]; severe: 5.1% [95% CI, 3.8%-6.9%] vs 0.7% [95% CI, 0.5%-0.9%]). Higher risk of depression symptoms during COVID-19 was associated with having lower income (odds ratio, 2.37 [95% CI, 1.26-4.43]), having less than $5000 in savings (odds ratio, 1.52 [95% CI, 1.02-2.26]), and exposure to more stressors (odds ratio, 3.05 [95% CI, 1.95-4.77]). Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that prevalence of depression symptoms in the US was more than 3-fold higher during COVID-19 compared with before the COVID-19 pandemic. Individuals with lower social resources, lower economic resources, and greater exposure to stressors (eg, job loss) reported a greater burden of depression symptoms. Post-COVID-19 plans should account for the probable increase in mental illness to come, particularly among at-risk populations.","Ettman, Catherine K; Abdalla, Salma M; Cohen, Gregory H; Sampson, Laura; Vivier, Patrick M; Galea, Sandro",JAMA Netw Open,533,29

Major phenotypes include recurrent respiratory tract infections and bronchiectasis, aspiration, respiratory muscle abnormalities, interstitial lung disease, and pulmonary fibrosis. At present, no effective pulmonary therapy for A-T exists. Cell therapy using adipose-derived mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (ASCs) might be a promising approach for tissue regeneration. The aim of the present project was to investigate whether ASCs migrate into the injured lung parenchyma of Atm-deficient mice as an indication of incipient tissue damage during A-T. Therefore, ASCs isolated from luciferase transgenic mice (mASCs) were intravenously transplanted into Atm-deficient and wild-type mice. Retention kinetics of the cells were monitored using in vivo bioluminescence imaging (BLI) and completed by subsequent verification using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The in vivo imaging and the qPCR results demonstrated migration accompanied by a significantly longer retention time of transplanted mASCs in the lung parenchyma of Atm-deficient mice compared to wild type mice. In conclusion, our study suggests incipient damage in the lung parenchyma of Atm-deficient mice. In addition, our data further demonstrate that a combination of luciferase-based PCR together with BLI is a pivotal tool for tracking mASCs after transplantation in models of inflammatory lung diseases such as A-T.","Baer, Patrick C; Sann, Julia; Duecker, Ruth Pia; Ullrich, Evelyn; Geiger, Helmut; Bader, Peter; Zielen, Stefan; Schubert, Ralf",,533,29

As both a mediator and a target of IFN signals, STAT1 expression reports on, and determines IFN activity. Gene expression analyses of melanoma patient samples revealed varied levels of STAT1 expression, which highly correlated with expression of >700 genes. The ability of oncolytic viruses to exploit tumor-induced defects to antiviral responses suggests that oncolytic viruses may efficiently target a subset of melanomas, yet these should be defined. We modeled this scenario with murine B16F10 melanomas, immortalized skin fibroblasts as controls and a novel oncolytic virus, EHDV-TAU. In B16F10 cells, constitutive low expression of STAT1 and its target genes, which included intracellular pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), correlated with their inability to mount IFN-based antiviral responses upon EHDV-TAU challenge, and with potency of EHDV-TAU-induced oncolysis. This under-expression of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) and PRRs, and the inability of EHDV-TAU to induce their expression, were reversed by epigenetic modifiers, suggesting epigenetic silencing as a basis for their under-expression. Despite their inability to mount IFN/STAT-based responses upon viral infection, EHDV-TAU infected B16F10 cells secreted immune-stimulatory chemokines. Accordingly, in vivo, EHDV-TAU enhanced intra-tumoral infiltration of cytotoxic T-cells and reduced growth of local and distant tumors. We propose that 'STAT1 signatures' should guide melanoma virotherapy treatments, and that oncolytic viruses such as EHDV-TAU have the potential to exploit the cellular context of low-STAT1 tumors.","Dellac, Sarah; Ben-Dov, Hamutal; Raanan, Ayala; Saleem, Hanna; Zamostiano, Rachel; Semyatich, Rinat; Lavi, Sara; Witz, Isaac P; Bacharach, Eran; Ehrlich, Marcelo",Int. j. cancer,533,16

No doubt, European Integration is the greatest project of all times. But it is also true that the European Union is currently experiencing the most difficult period in its entire history being under the pressure of several crises – consequences of the world economic and financial crisis, new risks of a global economic slowdown as a result of the coronavirus outbreak, migration crisis, troubled relations with the U.S., China and Russia, etc. The end of the East-West confrontation that removed the threat of a global conflict has resulted in the crisis of the Euro-Atlantic partnership, namely the growing gap between the USA and the EU in the security sector, the emergence of a new China with global ambitions, the rise of a self-assertive post-Soviet Russia and numerous regional actors – India, Japan, Turkey, Iran, Brazil and other. However, the modern polycentric world is strongly influenced by the evolving balance between two opposite trends – the trend towards multilateral cooperation on global challenges and the trend towards a new bipolarity. This new bipolarity is developing within the same capitalist system and can be defined as a growing split between the liberal and authoritarian capitalism. The former is most vividly represented by the European Union, USA and their allies, while the latter – by China and Russia. Strictly speaking, nowadays, the only full-fledged power center is the United States, whose economic and military potential guarantees its political influence in world affairs. China is approaching these standards. The European Union and Russia represent two opposite models. The EU is an economic power center while Russia is a military power center. In order to become an influential power center capable to protect its integrationist model globally, the European Union needs to learn Realpolitik, rethink its previous idealistic approach towards the postbipolar world and acquire strategic autonomy capabilities. Aside from this, the EU leadership should resolve numerous existential problems, beginning with the challenge of nationalism, which is fueled by the crisis of liberal democracy, and ending with the necessity to define future contours of the European construct. The COVID-19 pandemic has made adjustments to the existing postbipolar world order and “Great Power” competition, having weakened two leaders of globalization – USA and China-and opened a new window of opportunity for EU.","Arbatova, Nadezhda K.",World Economy Int.

Previous DBS-fMRI studies have shown that electrical stimulation of the ventrolateral (VL) thalamus can modulate sensorimotor cortices in a frequency and amplitude dependent manner. Here, we investigated, using a swine animal model, how the direction and orientation of the electric field, induced by VL-thalamus DBS, affects activity in the sensorimotor cortex. Adult swine underwent implantation of a novel 16-electrode (4 rows x 4 columns) directional DBS lead in the VL thalamus. A within-subject design was used to compare fMRI responses for (1) directional stimulation consisting of monopolar stimulation in four radial directions around the DBS lead, and (2) orientation-selective stimulation where an electric field dipole was rotated 0°-360° around a quadrangle of electrodes. Functional responses were quantified in the premotor, primary motor, and somatosensory cortices. High frequency electrical stimulation through leads implanted in the VL thalamus induced directional tuning in cortical response patterns to varying degrees depending on DBS lead position. Orientation-selective stimulation showed maximal Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) contrast when the electric field was oriented approximately parallel to the DBS lead, which is consistent with known axonal orientations of the cortico-thalamocortical pathway. These results demonstrate that directional and orientation-selective stimulation paradigms in the VL thalamus can tune network-level modulation patterns in the sensorimotor cortex, which may have translational utility in improving functional outcomes of DBS therapy.","Slopsema, Julia P; Canna, Antonietta; Uchenik, Michelle; Lehto, Lauri J; Krieg, Jordan; Wilmerding, Lucius; Koski, Dee M; Kobayashi, Naoharu; Dao, Joan; Blumenfeld, Madeline; Filip, Pavel; Min, Hoon-Ki; Mangia, Silvia; Johnson, Matthew D; Michaeli, Shalom",Neuroimage,533,20

PA results from an impaired activity of the mitochondrial enzyme, propionyl-CoA carboxylase (PCC). PCC holds an essential role in the catabolic pathways for odd-chain fatty acids, cholesterol side-chains and branched-chain amino acids. Errors in these pathways result in the accumulation of toxic metabolites that may advance into end-organ damage and dysfunction. Clinical manifestations of PA include relapsing courses of severe metabolic acidosis, concurrent viral or bacterial infection, episodic vomiting, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), seizures, developmental delay, hypotonia, hyperammonemia, osteopenia, pancreatitis and cardiomyopathy. This case describes a 3-year-old boy with PA who presented with an acute metabolic crisis, precipitated by Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epidermidis) bacteremia and severe acute respiratory syndrome due to coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) co-infection. He required anesthetic management for surgical removal of an infected central venous port. Anesthetic care for this patient presented the unique challenges of metabolic decompensation amidst infection with SARS-CoV-2.

Although approved vaccines bring much hope, a vaccination program covering the entire global population will take a very long time, making the development of effective antiviral drugs an effective solution for the immediate treatment of this dangerous infection. Previous studies found that three natural compounds, namely, tannic acid, 3-isotheaflavin-3-gallate and theaflavin-3,3-digallate, are effective proteinase (3CLpro) inhibitors of SARS-CoV (IC50 <10 µM). Based on this information and due to the high sequence identity between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro, these three compounds could be candidate inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro. This paper explores the structural and energetic features that guided the molecular recognition of these three compounds for dimeric SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV 3CLpro, the functional state of this enzyme, using docking and MD simulations with the molecular mechanics-generalized-born surface area (MMGBSA) approach. Energetic analysis demonstrated that the three compounds reached good affinities in both systems in the following order: tannic acid > 3-isotheaflavin-3-gallate > theaflavin-3,3-digallate. This tendency is in line with that experimentally reported between these ligands and SARS-CoV 3CLpro. Therefore, tannic acid may have clinical usefulness against COVID-19 by acting as a potent inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

The causative virus was identified from throat swab samples in the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CCDC) on January 7, 2020, and it was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS‐CoV‐2). Subsequently, World Health Organization (WHO) renamed it COVID‐19. COVID-19 was a highly infectious newly discovered coronavirus, which led to a worldwide pandemic. It has shown an equal number of cases between men and women, but a lower mortality rate in women. Materials and methods: A retrospective observational study was conducted in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology of GMC, Srinagar, comparing the total number of emergency admissions including obstetric emergencies, such as ectopic pregnancy, intrauterine device (IUD), severe anemia, eclampsia, abruption, obstructed labor, and postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) during a period of 6 months from March 2020 to August 2020 with that from March 2019 to August 2019. Results: A total of 13,784 patients were admitted over a period of 6 months from March 2020 to August 2020, and there was a significant decline in the admissions as compared to pre-COVID-19 period of March 2019 to August 2019 (p-value, 0.007).

OBJECTIVE: This study examines public engagement in crisis communication about COVID-19 during the early epidemic stage and the practical strategy of social mobilization to mitigate the infodemic. METHODS: We retrieved the unbiased values of the top-ranked search phrases between December 30, 2019, and July 15, 2020, which normalized the anonymized, categorized, and aggregated samples from Google Search data. This study illustrates the most-searched terms, including the official COVID-19 terms, the stigmatized terms, and other controls, to measure the collective behavioral propensities to stigmatized terms and to explore the global reaction to the COVID-19 epidemic in the real world. We calculated the ratio of the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases to the regional population as the cumulative rate (R) of a specific country or territory and calculated the Gini coefficient (G) to measure the collective heterogeneity of crowd behavior. RESULTS: People around the world are using stigmatizing terms on Google Search, and these terms were used earlier than the official names. Many stigmatized monikers against China (eg, ""Wuhan pneumonia,"" G=0.73; ""Wuhan coronavirus,"" G=0.60; ""China pneumonia,"" G=0.59; ""China coronavirus,"" G=0.52; ""Chinese coronavirus,"" G=0.50) had high collective heterogeneity of crowd behavior between December 30, 2019, and July 15, 2020, while the official terms ""COVID-19"" (G=0.44) and ""SARS-CoV-2"" (G=0.42) have not become de facto standard usages. Moreover, the pattern of high consistent usage was observed in 13 territories with low cumulative rates (R) between January 16 and July 15, 2020, out of 58 countries and territories that have reported confirmed cases of COVID-19. In the scientific literature, multifarious naming practices may have provoked unintended negative impacts by stigmatizing Chinese people. The World Health Organization; the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization; and the media initiated campaigns for fighting back against the COVID-19 infodemic with the same mission but in diverse voices. CONCLUSIONS: Infodemiological analysis can articulate the collective propensities to stigmatized monikers across search behaviors, which may reflect the collective sentiment of backlash against China and Chinese people in the real world. The full-fledged official terms are expected to fight back against the resilience of negative perceptual bias amid the COVID-19 epidemic. Such official naming efforts against the infodemic should be met with a fair share of identification in scientific conventions and sociocultural paradigms. As an integral component of preparedness, appropriate nomenclatures should be duly assigned to the newly identified coronavirus, and social mobilization in a uniform voice is a priority for combating the next infodemic.","Hu, Zhiwen; Yang, Zhongliang; Li, Qi; Zhang, An",J Med Internet Res,533,20

Within the last 20 years, there has been growing evidence for a higher risk to develop GD in response to certain dopaminergic medication. Especially the dopamine agonists pramipexole and ropinirole, and the dopamine modulator aripiprazole seem to increase the likelihood for GD. The goal of this study was to examine the association between a prescription for either of the three pharmaceuticals and a GD diagnosis in a large cross-sectional study of the Swedish population. Compared to patients with any other dopaminergic drug prescription (38.7% with GD), the diagnosis was more common in patients with a dopamine agonist prescription (69.8% with GD), resulting in an odds ratio of 3.2. A similar association was found between aripiprazole prescriptions and GD diagnoses, which were analysed within the subgroup of all patients with schizophrenia or a schizotypal, delusional, or another non-mood psychotic disorder. An aripiprazole prescription increased the likelihood of GD (88.8%) in comparison to patients without an aripiprazole prescription (71.2%) with an odds ratio of 3.4. This study contributes to the increasingly reliable evidence for an association between several dopaminergic drugs and a higher risk for developing GD. Therefore, one future research goal should be a better understanding of the neurobiology in GD to be able to design more selective dopaminergic medication with less severe side effects. Additionally, this knowledge could enable the development of pharmacotherapy in GD and other addictive disorders.","Wolfschlag, Mirjam; Håkansson, Anders",PLoS One,533,24

Severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infects the lungs and the gastrointestinal tract to some extent. Rapid structural mutations have increased the virulence and infectivity of the virus drastically. One such mutated strain known as the UK variant has caused many deaths in the United Kingdom. HYPOTHESIS: Among several indigenous natural ingredients used for prevention and cure of many diseases, the catechins have been reported for their antiviral activity, even against SARS-CoV-2. Characteristic mutations present on the spike protein have presented the newer strain its enhanced infectivity. The spike protein helps the virus bind to ACE2 receptor of the host cell and hence is a drug target. Catechins have been reported for their entry-inhibitory activity against several viruses. METHOD: In this study, we performed molecular docking of different catechins with the wild and mutant variants of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. The stability of the best docked complexes was validated using molecular dynamics simulation. RESULTS: The in-silico studies show that the catechins form favourable interactions with the spike protein and can potentially impair its function. Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) showed the best binding among the catechins against both the strains. Both the protein-ligand complexes were stable throughout the simulation time frame. CONCLUSION: The outcomes should encourage further exploration of the antiviral activity of EGCG against SARS-CoV-2 and its variants.","Mhatre, Susmit; Gurav, Nitisha; Shah, Mansi; Patravale, Vandana",Comput Biol Med,533,13

Despite a willingness to quit, homeless youth have little success in doing so on their own, and existing cessation resources tailored to this population are lacking. Homeless youth generally enjoy the camaraderie and peer support that group-based programs offer, but continuous in-person support during a quit attempt can be prohibitively expensive. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the feasibility and acceptability of an automated text messaging intervention (TMI) as an adjunct to group-based cessation counseling and provision of nicotine patches to help homeless youth quit smoking. This paper outlines the lessons learned from the implementation of the TMI intervention. METHODS: Homeless youth smokers aged 18 to 25 years who were interested in quitting (n=77) were recruited from drop-in centers serving homeless youth in the Los Angeles area. In this pilot randomized controlled trial, all participants received a group-based cessation counseling session and nicotine patches, with 52% (40/77) randomly assigned to receive 6 weeks of text messages to provide additional support for their quit attempt. Participants received text messages on their own phone rather than receiving a study-issued phone for the TMI. We analyzed baseline and follow-up survey data as well as back-end data from the messaging platform to gauge the acceptability and feasibility of the TMI among the 40 participants who received it. RESULTS: Participants had widespread (smart)phone ownership—16.4% (36/219) were ineligible for study participation because they did not have a phone that could receive text messages. Participants experienced interruptions in their phone use (eg, 44% [16/36] changed phone numbers during the follow-up period) but reported being able to receive the majority of messages. These survey results were corroborated by back-end data (from the program used to administer the TMI) showing a message delivery rate of about 95%. Participant feedback points to the importance of carefully crafting text messages, which led to high (typically above 70%) approval of most text messaging components of the intervention. Qualitative feedback indicated that participants enjoyed the group counseling session that preceded the TMI and suggested including more such group elements into the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: The TMI was well accepted and feasible to support smoking cessation among homeless youth. Given high rates of smartphone ownership, the next generation of phone-based smoking cessation interventions for this population should consider using approaches beyond text messages and focus on finding ways to develop effective approaches to include group interaction using remote implementation. Given overall resource constraints and in particular the exigencies of the currently ongoing COVID-19 epidemic, phone-based interventions are a promising approach to support homeless youth, a population urgently in need of effective smoking cessation interventions.

However, since not all population groups experience the impacts of the pandemic in the same way, the objective of this study was to identify the individual characteristics associated with the feeling of uncertainty during the lockdown that commenced in March 2020 in Greece. The study used data from the “Public Opinion in the European Union (EU) in Time of Coronavirus Crisis” survey. The sample consisted of 1050 individuals aged between 16 and 54 years. According to the analysis, which was based on a logistic regression model, the emotional status of older individuals, those who experienced income and job losses since the beginning of the pandemic, and middle-class and high-class individuals, is more likely to be described as a feeling of uncertainty. In addition, the emotional status of individuals with less concern for their own health and that of family and friends is less likely to be described as a feeling of uncertainty. Although the results related to age, income, and job losses, as regards concern for health, agree with the international literature, the limited health literacy of lower-class individuals may explain the reduced likelihood of their experiencing feelings of uncertainty. The results confirm the international literature describing several aspects of uncertainty due to the COVID-19 crisis.","Zavras, Dimitris",Int J Environ Res Public Health,533,24

Nevertheless, occupational therapy educators should use diverse methods of learning assessment to examine student learning outcomes more fully with an evaluation that supports the overall complexity of the process, particularly learners’ subjective experience. The aim of this article is to identify the range of perspectives among occupational therapy undergraduates regarding terms or concepts that are key for improving their professional reasoning. METHODS: Q-methodology was used to address the aim of the study. A concourse relating to a series of ideas, phrases, terminology, and concepts associated with various studies on professional reasoning in occupational therapy, specifically on students in this field, was generated. The terms that had the clearest evidence, the most relevance or the greatest number of citations in the literature were collected (n = 37). The P-set was assembled by non-probabilistic sampling for convenience. It comprised undergraduate university students in occupational therapy. Factor analysis was conducted using Ken-Q Analysis v.1.0.6, reducing the number of Q-sets to smaller groups of factors representing a common perspective. RESULTS: Through statistical analysis of the Q-sorts of 37 occupational therapy students, 8 default factors were identified. The four factors in accordance with the selection criteria were rotated by varimax rotation to identify variables that could be grouped together. Each viewpoint was interpreted, discussed and liked to different aspects of professional reasoning in occupational therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The observed perceptions were linked to the various aspects of professional reasoning that have been widely discussed in the occupational therapy literature. For most of the students, there was a strong correspondence between the narrative, interactive and conditional aspects of the various components.","Márquez-Álvarez, Luis-Javier; Calvo-Arenillas, José-Ignacio; Jiménez-Arberas, Estíbaliz; Talavera-Valverde, Miguel-Ángel; Souto-Gómez, Ana-Isabel; Moruno-Miralles, Pedro",BMC Med Educ,533,1

The sequences are represented by sets of “material points” in a 4D space - 4D-dynamic graphs. The graphs representing the sequences are treated as “rigid bodies” and characterized by values analogous to the ones used in the classical dynamics. As the graphical representations of the sequences, the projections of the graphs into 2D and 3D spaces are used. The method has been applied to an analysis of the complete genome sequences of the 2019 novel coronavirus. As a result, 2D and 3D classification maps are obtained. The coordinate axes in the maps correspond to the values derived from the exact formulas characterizing the graphs: the coordinates of the centers of mass and the 4D moments of inertia. The points in the maps represent sequences and their coordinates are used as the classifiers. The main result of this work has been derived from the 3D classification maps. The distribution of clusters of points which emerged in these maps, supports the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 may have originated in bat and in pangolin. Pilot calculations for Zika virus sequence data prove that the proposed approach is also applicable to a description of time evolution of genome sequences of viruses.","Bielińska-Wąż, Dorota; Wąż, Piotr",Comput Biol Med,533,17

Those who progress to end-stage kidney disease often commence dialysis as a life-extending treatment. For cognitively impaired patients, the decision as to whether they commence dialysis will fall to someone else. This scoping review was conducted to map existing literature pertaining to how decisions about dialysis are and should be made with, for, and on behalf of adult patients who lack decision-making capacity. In doing so, it forms the basis of a larger body of work that is exploring how these decisions ought to be made. METHODS: To identify relevant papers, searches were conducted on Ovid MEDLINE(R), Embase, PsychINFO, The Cochrane Library, and Web of Science. Inclusion criteria were then applied, requiring that papers: report on empirical studies about how decisions about dialysis are made and/or discuss how decisions about dialysis should be made with, for, and on behalf of adult patients who lack decision-making capacity; be published from 1961 onwards; and be published in English. This resulted in 27 papers eligible for inclusion. RESULTS: Of note, the majority of papers originated in the United States. There was wide variation across the included papers. Extracted data were grouped under the following themes: involving various parties (patient involvement, family dominance, and wider communication); objectivity about care options (including difficulties with family detachment); cultural sensitivity; medical versus non-medical factors; managing nonadherent patients; and the role and prevalence of substituted judgement. The literature shows that there is inconsistency in the principles and processes surrounding decisions made about dialysis with, for, and on behalf of adult patients who lack decision-making capacity. CONCLUSIONS: This scoping review demonstrates that there is significant variation in both the practice and theory of dialysis decision making with, for, and on behalf of cognitively impaired adult patients. Complexity arises in considering who should get a say, how influential their say should be in a decision, and what factors are most relevant to the decision. A lack of up-to-date literature exploring this issue is highlighted, with this scoping review providing a useful groundwork from which further research can be undertaken.","Parsons, Jordan A.; Ives, Jonathan",BMC Med Ethics,533,20

Here, we investigated the potential extent of T cell cross-reactivity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that can be conferred by other coronaviruses and influenza virus, and generated an in silico map of public and private CD8+ T cell epitopes between coronaviruses. We observed 794 predicted SARS-CoV-2 epitopes of which 52% were private and 48% were public. Ninety-nine percent of the public epitopes were shared with SARS-CoV and 5.4% were shared with either one of four common coronaviruses, 229E, HKU1, NL63, and OC43. Moreover, to assess the potential risk of self-reactivity and/or diminished T cell response for peptides identical or highly similar to the host, we identified predicted epitopes with high sequence similarity with human proteome. Lastly, we compared predicted epitopes from coronaviruses with epitopes from influenza virus deposited in IEDB, and found only a small number of peptides with limited potential for cross-reactivity between the two virus families. We believe our comprehensive in silico profile of private and public epitopes across coronaviruses would facilitate design of vaccines, and provide insights into the presence of pre-existing coronavirus-specific memory CD8+ T cells that may influence immune responses against SARS-CoV-2.","Lee, Chloe H.; Pinho, Mariana Pereira; Buckley, Paul R.; Woodhouse, Isaac B.; Ogg, Graham; Simmons, Alison; Napolitani, Giorgio; Koohy, Hashem",Front Immunol,533,20

Methods Data on the compounds and targets of MXSGD were collected from the Traditional Chinese Medicene Systems Parmacology Database and Analysis Platform (TCMSP) and TCM Databases@Taiwan. Data on ACE2-related targets and the protein-protein interaction (PPI) were collected from the String database. The Cytoscape 3.7.2 was used to construct and analyze the networks. The DAVID platform was used for Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment analyses. Results Data on 272 MXSGD targets and 21 SARS-CoV-2 potential targets were collected. Four networks were constructed and analyzed based on the data: (1) compound-target network of MXSGD; (2) MXSGD-SARS-CoV-2-PPI network; (3) cluster of MXSGD-SARS-CoV-2-PPI network; (4) Herb-Pathway-Target network. The core targets included AKT1, MAPK3, IL-6, TP53, VEGFA, TNF, CASP3, EGFR, EGF and MAPK1. The antiviral biological processes were inflammatory responses (inflammatory cells, inflammatory cytokines and their signaling pathways), immune responses (T cells, monocytes, B cells and other immune cells), immune factors (IFN-γ, TNF-α and so on), virus defense, humoral immunity and mucosal innate immune response. The antivirus-related signaling pathways included TNF, NOD-like receptor, FoxO, PI3K-AKT and Toll-like receptor signaling pathways. Conclusions MXSGD can control disease progression by regulating multiple compounds and targets; it can reduce inflammation and balance immunity by regulating several proteins that interact with ACE2 and signaling pathways closely related to disease development.","Shi-Ying, Zhang; Ling, Li; Ning, Zhang; Hong-Tao, Xia; Fang-Guo, Lu; Wei-Qing, Li",Digital Chinese Medicine,533,1

We aimed to examine the health systems and contextual factors that might have contributed to the substantial decline in maternal mortality between 1997 and 2014. We chose to focus on western China because poverty, ethnic diversity, and geographical access represent particular challenges to ensuring universal access to maternal care in the region. METHODS: In this systematic assessment, we used data from national census reports, National Statistical Yearbooks, the National Maternal and Child Health Routine Reporting System, the China National Health Accounts report, and National Health Statistical Yearbooks to describe changes in policies, health financing, health workforce, health infrastructure, coverage of maternal care, and maternal mortality by region between 1997 and 2014. We used a multivariate linear regression model to examine which contextual and health systems factors contributed to the regional variation in maternal mortality ratio in the same period. Using data from a cross-sectional survey in 2011, we also examined equity in access to maternity care in 42 poor counties in western China. FINDINGS: Maternal mortality declined by 8·9% per year between 1997 and 2014 (geometric mean ratio for each year 0·91, 95% CI 0·91–0·92). After adjusting for GDP per capita, length of highways, female illiteracy, the number of licensed doctors per 1000 population, and the proportion of ethnic minorities, the maternal mortality ratio was 118% higher in the western region (2·18, 1·44–3·28) and 41% higher in the central region (1·41, 0·99–2·01) than in the eastern region. In the rural western region, the proportion of births in health facilities rose from 41·9% in 1997 to 98·4% in 2014. Underpinning such progress was the Government's strong commitment to long-term strategies to ensure access to delivery care in health facilities—eg, professionalisation of maternity care in large hospitals, effective referral systems for women medically or socially at high risk, and financial subsidies for antenatal and delivery care. However, in the poor western counties, substantial disparity by education level of the mother existed in access to health facility births (44% of illiterate women vs 100% of those with college or higher education), antenatal care (17% vs 69%) had at least four visits), and caesarean section (8% vs 44%). INTERPRETATION: Despite remarkable progress in maternal survival in China, substantial disparities remain, especially for the poor, less educated, and ethnic minority groups in remote areas in western China. Whether China's highly medicalised model of maternity care will be an answer for these populations is uncertain. A strategy modelled after China's immunisation programme, whereby care is provided close to the women's homes, might need to be explored, with township hospitals taking a more prominent role.

IL-6 might play a key role in the cytokine storm and might be a potential target to treat severe and critical COVID-19. Tocilizumab is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody, directed against IL-6 receptor. Methods This multicentre study project includes a single-arm phase 2 study and a further parallel cohort, enrolling hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and oxygen saturation at rest in ambient air ≤93% or requiring respiratory support. Patients receive tocilizumab 8 mg/kg (up to 800 mg) as one intravenous administration. A second administration (same dose) after 12 h is optional. Two-week and one-month lethality rates are the co-primary endpoints. Sample size planned for the phase 2 study is 330 patients. The parallel cohort will include patients who cannot enter the phase 2 study because being intubated from more than 24 h, or having already received tocilizumab, or the phase 2 study has reached sample size. Primary analysis will include patients enrolled in the phase 2 study. Results of the primary analysis will be validated in the prospective cohort of patients consecutively registered after phase 2 closure from March 20 to March 24, who were potentially eligible for the phase 2 study. Conclusion This trial aims to verify the safety and efficacy of tocilizumab in the Italian population with COVID-19 pneumonia and respiratory impairment.

A number of STEM faculty professional development programs aim to provide such pedagogical support, and it is necessary to understand the activity and learning process for faculty in these settings. In this paper, a taxonomy for describing the learning opportunities in faculty (online) learning community meetings is presented. Faculty learning communities, meeting either in-person or (increasingly) online, are a common form of professional development. They aim to develop the pedagogical and reflective skills of participants through regular meetings centered on conversations about teaching and learning. RESULTS: The tool presented in this paper, the Taxonomy of Opportunities to Learn (TxOTL), provides a structured approach to making sense of the dynamic interactions that occur during faculty learning community meetings. The origins and development of the TxOTL are described, followed by a detailed presentation of the constructs that make up the TxOTL: communicative approach used in a conversation, the concepts developed, and the meeting segment category. The TxOTL characterizes the learning opportunities presented by a faculty learning community conversation through describing the content of the conversation as well as how participants engage in the conversation. Examples of the tool in use are provided through an application to a faculty online learning community serving instructors of a physical science curriculum. A visual representation used to compactly display the results of applying the taxonomy to a meeting is detailed as well. These examples serve to illustrate the types of claims the TxOTL facilitates. CONCLUSIONS: The TxOTL allows one to examine learning opportunities available to a faculty learning community group, analyze concept development present in their conversations, track change over time in a given group, and identify patterns between meeting segment categories and communicative approaches. It is useful for researchers as well as facilitators of these STEM faculty professional development groups. The taxonomy is most applicable to faculty (online) learning communities, with limited use for workshops and K-12 professional development contexts.

Governments around the world are already making drones available to police for purposes including border control, criminal investigation, rescue missions, traffic management, and the monitoring of public assemblies. Unarmed and controlled remotely, these camera-equipped aircraft provide a powerful and mobile surveillance capacity that can be highly effective in detecting suspicious activity and guiding police operations. In addition, for situations where criminal violence presents a danger to public safety, some governments appear to be readying their police to neutralize threats using drones that are also equipped with weapons. In anticipation of that potential development, this article discusses whether or how police should use armed drones. It applies some of the established ethical principles on police use of force (necessity, proportionality, and precaution), and it explores some of the challenges a drone-using, “tele-present” police officer is likely to face in seeking to adhere to those principles.","Enemark, Christian",Criminal justice ethics,533,1

Pathogens such as viruses are always evolving owing to the processes of antigenic shift and drift. Such viral evolution results in the emergence of new types and serovars that prove deadly for humans-like influenza pandemics, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). The pandemic of novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is the recent example. It has resulted in a great loss of human lives and a serious burden on economy across the globe. To counter such situations, a system should exist for the early detection of emerging viral pathogens. This will help prevent possible outbreaks and save human lives. Most of such deadly novel viruses and viral outbreaks are known to be originated from animal hosts. Regular monitoring of potential hot spots of such emerging microbes, such as zoos and animal markets, through metagenomics could help assess the presence of new viruses and pathogens. In this review, we focus on the potential of viral metagenomics and propose a surveillance system based on it for the early detection and hence prevention of such emerging viral infections.","Mohsin, Hareem; Asif, Azka; Fatima, Minhaj; Rehman, Yasir",Arch Microbiol,533,20

Despite great advances in the development of radiotherapy and chemotherapy, relapse and metastasis in NPC patients remain major causes of mortality. Evidence accumulated over recent years indicates that Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) lytic replication plays an important role in the pathogenesis of NPC and inhibition of EBV reactivation is now being considered as a goal for the therapy of EBV-associated cancers. With this in mind, a panel of dietary compounds was screened and emodin was found to have potential anti-EBV activity. Through Western blotting, immunofluorescence, and flow cytometric analysis, we show that emodin inhibits the expression of EBV lytic proteins and blocks virion production in EBV- positive epithelial cell lines. In investigating the underlying mechanism, reporter assays indicated that emodin represses Zta promoter (Zp) and Rta promoter (Rp) activities, triggered by various inducers. Mapping of the Zp construct reveals that the SP1 binding region is important for emodin-triggered repression and emodin is shown to be able to inhibit SP1 expression, suggesting that it likely inhibits EBV reactivation by suppression of SP1 expression. Moreover, we also show that emodin inhibits the tumorigenic properties induced by repeated EBV reactivation, including micronucleus formation, cell proliferation, migration, and matrigel invasiveness. Emodin administration also represses the tumor growth in mice which is induced by EBV activation. Taken together, our results provide a potential chemopreventive agent in restricting EBV reactivation and NPC recurrence.","Wu, Chung-Chun; Chen, Mei-Shu; Cheng, Yu-Jhen; Ko, Ying-Chieh; Lin, Su-Fang; Chiu, Ing-Ming; Chen, Jen-Yang",Cancers (Basel),533,21

No difference in disease severity was observed between patients hospitalized in the geriatric unit infected with WT or D34. In vitro D26 and D34 characterization revealed comparable replication kinetics with the wild-type (WT), but differential host immune responses.

The survey inquired about attitudes toward the residency interview process in the era of COVID-19 and which interview elements could be replicated virtually. Descriptive statistics were utilized. RESULTS: 80% of urology applicants from the 2019/2020 matches received our survey. 156 people (24% of recipients) responded. 34% preferred virtual interviews, while 41% in-person interviews at each program, and 25% regional/centralized interviews. 64% said that interactions with residents (pre/post-interview social and informal time) were the most important interview day component and 81% said it could not be replicated virtually. Conversely, 81% believed faculty interviews could be replicated virtually. 87% believed that city visits could not be accomplished virtually. A plurality felt that away rotations and second-looks should be allowed (both 45%). COMMENT: Applicants feel that faculty interviews can be replicated virtually, while resident interactions cannot.

Patients may not show specific signs or symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection, and the age of onset is similar to that of stroke. Furthermore, an increase in neurological conditions, specifically acute cerebrovascular disease, has been detected. Providing emergency treatment for acute stroke in accordance with the strict epidemic control measures is currently one of the main challenges, as acute stroke is rapid onset and a major cause of death and disability globally. We aimed to evaluate the emergency treatment system for acute stroke during the epidemic control period to provide a reference and basis for informing government and medical institutions on improving patient treatment rates during this period. Methods: Difficulties faced in providing emergency treatment for stroke during an epidemic were investigated and combined with medical educational resources and clinical management experiences to construct an emergency treatment framework for acute stroke during the epidemic. Findings: Currently, emergency treatment measures for acute stroke during the epidemic control period are limited because the main focus is on identifying COVID-19 comorbidities during the critical period. Establishing standards for patients in the neurological outpatient consultation rooms and emergency observation and resuscitation zones; implementing a fast-lane system for the emergency treatment of patients with acute stroke, and strengthening ward management and medicine popularization, can improve the treatment efficiency for stroke patients during the epidemic and provide a reference for peers in clinical practice. Interpretation: Emergency treatment for acute stroke during COVID-19 epidemic control period requires a joint promotion of clinical, popularization, and teaching resources.","Yang, Haojun; Chen, Zhuohui; Fan, Yishu; Xiang, Lan; Hu, Xinhang; Wu, Tong; Xiao, Bo; Feng, Li; Zhao, Zhihong; Chi, Yunfang; Zhang, Mengqi",Front Neurol,533,5

In the case of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), droplet spread can occur from symptomatic as well as pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic persons. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has therefore recently recommended home-made cloth face coverings for use by the general public in areas of significant community-based transmission. Because medical masks and N95 respirators are in short supply, these are to be reserved for healthcare workers. There is, however, little information on the effectiveness of home-made face coverings in reducing droplet dissemination. Here, we ascertained the performance of ten different fabrics, ranging from cotton to silk, in blocking high velocity droplets, using a 3-layered commercial medical mask as a benchmark material. We also assessed their breathability and ability to soak water. We reason that the materials should be as breathable as possible, without compromising blocking efficiency, to reduce air flow through the sides of the mask since such flow would defeat the purpose of the mask. We found that most home fabrics substantially block droplets, even as a single layer. With two layers, blocking performance can reach that of surgical mask without significantly compromising breathability. Furthermore, we observed that home fabrics are hydrophilic to varying degrees, and hence soak water. In contrast, medical masks are hydrophobic, and tend to repel water. Incoming droplets are thus soaked and 'held back' by home fabrics, which might offer an as of yet untapped and understudied advantage of home-made cloth masks. Overall, our study suggests that most double-layered cloth face coverings may help reduce droplet transmission of respiratory infections.","Aydin, Onur; Emon, Md Abul Bashar; Saif, M Taher A",,533,16
